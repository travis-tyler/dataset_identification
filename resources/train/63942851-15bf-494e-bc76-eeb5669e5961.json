[4] [5] [6] The Healthy HungerFree Kids Act, 7 signed into law in December 2010, gave the US Department of Agriculture the authority to set nutritional standards for all foods sold in schools, including those in the department's lunch program, as well as so-called competitive foods (ie, products sold in vending machines, school stores, and \u00e0 la carte lines). 8 Specific changes are being developed. The only current regulation for competitive products is that foods of minimal nutritional value (including soft drinks) cannot be sold in the cafeteria during lunchtime; however, these products can be sold in vending machines or school stores at any time, and other sugary beverages, such as sweetened teas and sports drinks, are not covered by these regulations. 8 In 2007, the Institute of Medicine 9 issued a report about competitive foods in schools, noting that school meal programs should be the primary source of nutrition in schools, with limited student access to competitive foods but, where these products are available, that the items offered should consist of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lower-fat dairy products. The most recent data on competitive foods available in schools come from the School Health Profiles surveys by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 10 ; while pertaining only to secondary schools, results indicate that the availability of candy and non-low-fat salty snacks in vending machines, school stores, or snack bars decreased in 37 of 40 No. 108-265,  \u00a7204) , which required all school districts participating in the national school lunch programs, school breakfast programs, or other federal child nutrition programs to adopt and implement a wellness policy by the first day of the 2006-2007 school year. The law required each wellness policy to include nutrition guidelines for all foods and beverages available on campus during the school day; however, specific guidelines were not mandated, and most policies developed to date have been weak and fragmented. 13 Prior investigations on competitive foods in schools have documented widespread student access to competitive food venues and have shown that many products available in these venues are unhealthy. The School Nutrition Dietary Assessment Study-III found that competitive foods were available through 1 or more sources in almost all middle schools (97%) and high schools (100%) and, although less common in elementary schools, that 72.7% of public elementary schools had competitive foods available in vending machines, school stores, or \u00e0 la carte lines.\n11 Almost one-third (29.1%) of elementary school students consumed competitive foods, and the most commonly consumed items were low-nutrient or energy-dense products, such as desserts and snacks, cookies, and candy. 11 Furthermore, the availability of highsugar and high-fat foods and beverages in competitive venues, such as school stores and \u00e0 la carte lines, is significantly associated with greater calorie consumption among schoolchildren.\n14 Because of the importance of developing healthy eating habits early in childhood, efforts to improve the elementary school food environment are crucial to prevent childhood obesity. 4 This study presents the most up-to-date information available on student access to competitive foods in elementary schools, spanning 4 years from the 2006-2007 to the 2009-2010 school years. We also document student access to competitive foods in a nationally representative sample of private elementary schools.

Data collection occurred primarily between February and June of every school year, with a few additional surveys received during the summer following each school year. Our 2-part survey was mailed to the school principal with a request that the second section (from which these data were obtained) should be completed by food service personnel; approximately half of the food and beverage surveys were completed by food service personnel, with the rest completed by administrators, teachers, or other staff. A $100 incentive was offered for completing and returning the survey. Surveys were processed and double-entered for quality assurance. Survey response rates were calculated using the "}, {"section_title": "SAMPLING AND WEIGHTING", "text": "Our nationally representative samples of public and private elementary schools were developed at the Institute for Survey Research at the University of Michigan using sampling frames based on data sets from the National Center for Education Statistics. Public schools from all coterminous US states (excluding Alaska and Hawaii) were eligible for sampling. Because elementary schools vary in grade composition (eg, kindergarten through third grade and second through fifth grades), we selected third grade as a proxy for sampling and weighting. All schools included a third grade, and student-level weights were developed based on the enrollment of third-grade students. These weights provide inference to the percentage of elementary school students affected by each school-level practice. Weights were adjusted for nonresponse bias by modeling every school's propensity to respond. Variables used to model these adjustments included locale, US census region, school size, the percentage of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch (public schools only), and percentages of black, white, and Latino students."}, {"section_title": "OUTCOME MEASURES", "text": "We asked respondents to indicate whether beverages were sold in each of the following 3 competitive venues during lunchtime: vending machines, school stores or snack bars, and \u00e0 la carte lines. For each venue present at the school, we asked which types of foods were available in that venue. For vending machines and school stores, response options were yes or no. For \u00e0 la carte lines, response options were never, some days, or most or every day. The latter 2 responses were collapsed as a yes response. Product categories are listed in Table 1 . In addition, we grouped foods into the following 4 categories: (1) any salty product whether regular-fat or low-fat (regular-fat chips and pretzels, baked chips, or other low-fat salty snacks), (2) any low-fat product (low-fat salty snacks, low-fat baked goods, and low-fat ice cream), (3) any sweet product (candy, ice cream whether low-fat or not, and cookies, cakes, or baked goods whether low-fat or not), and (4) any healthier product (salads, vegetables, fresh fruits, and other fruits)."}, {"section_title": "CONTEXTUAL COVARIATES", "text": "We obtained school-level demographic and socioeconomic information from the National Center for Education Statistics Common Core of Data (CCD) (http://nces.ed.gov/ccd/). We ob- private school survey data. Contextual data were obtained on the total number of students in the school (school size), the percentage of students of white race/ethnicity at the school, US census region (West, Northeast, Midwest, or South [referent]), and locale (city [referent], suburb, township, or rural). An ordinal variable was created to reflect the following school size tertiles: small (\u03fd451 students), medium (451-621 students), or large (\u03fe621 students). For public schools only, we used the percentage of students eligible for free or reducedprice lunch as a proxy for socioeconomic status, and this variable was divided into the following 3 groups: higher socioeconomic status (\u03fd33% eligible [referent]), medium socioeconomic status (33%-66% eligible), or lower socioeconomic status (\u03fe66% eligible). Year was coded using 3 dummy variables to compare each of the latter 3 years against baseline (2006) (2007) ."}, {"section_title": "STATISTICAL ANALYSIS", "text": "Public schools in our sample were clustered within school districts, with a mean of 1.5 schools responding per district. We conducted analyses with commercially available software (STATA/SE, version 10.0; StataCorp LP) using the survey command to adjust for the clustering of schools within districts.\nWe examined changes over time using a series of multivariate logistic regression analyses, one for each outcome listed in Table 1 . Percentages are unadjusted for contextual covariates, but the statistical significance of regional differences was tested in multiple logistic regression analyses. These models were computed separately for public and private schools and included all contextual covariates and 3 dummy variables for each year vs baseline. Next, we examined public vs private school differences in a series of models using data from all schools. These models included school type\u03ebyear interaction terms; none were significant, and for parsimony these terms were removed from the models. Because of the large number of regressions (19 each for public schools, private schools, and public school vs private school differences in a combined sample), we only present differences with significance of at least P\u03fd.01.\nResults of the regression models for selected outcomes (access to competitive food venues and the availability of the 4 categories of food products) are given in Table 2 . Because these regression analyses showed a consistent pattern of regional differences, Table 3 gives estimates of the percentage of public elementary school students with access to competitive food venues and the availability of the 4 categories of food products (salty, low-fat, sweet, and healthier products) by US census region. Percentages are unadjusted for contextual covariates, but the statistical significance of regional differences was tested in multiple logistic regression analyses controlling for all contextual covariates and year. We also examined regional differences in access and availability using a series of logistic regression analyses restricted to schools that offered competitive foods in 1 or more venues (Table 3) . Logistic regression analyses for all outcomes in Table 3 were conducted using a set of US census a Estimates are weighted to the student level and represent percentages of elementary school students with access or availability. Estimates are unadjusted, but tests of significance are from multivariate logistic regression analyses as noted herein.\nb Difference between public and private school students significant at P\u03fd.001 in logistic regression analyses controlling for school size, US census region, locale, percentage of students of white race/ethnicity, and year.\nc Difference between public and private school students significant at P\u03fd.01 in logistic regression analyses controlling for school size, US census region, locale, percentage of students of white race/ethnicity, and year. region\u03ebyear interaction terms to control for possible differences over time for each region; however, none were significant, and for parsimony these terms were removed from the models. The sample size for private schools was not large enough to examine effects at the regional level; therefore, regional analyses are limited to public schools. Table 1 gives estimates of percentages of students with access to competitive food venues at school, along with the availability of food products in any venue, for public and private school students separately. A series of logistic regression analyses controlling for contextual covariates and year revealed more snack bars on campus for private school students than for public school students; however, \u00e0 la carte line competitive foods were more widely available for public school students. Compared with public school students, private school students also had greater availability of candy, salty snacks, regularfat baked goods, and regular-fat ice cream."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": "Separately for each school type, we examined changes over time in logistic regression analyses controlling for contextual covariates. Access to competitive food venues and the availability of most products remained stable across time; however, the availability of regular-fat ice cream decreased over time for public school students.\nOther than regional differences, the multivariate models did not reveal a consistent pattern of differences by contextual covariates. As summarized in Table 2 , lowfat products and sweet products were less likely to be available at smaller schools than at larger schools for public school students. Compared with students in urban schools, students in suburban schools were more likely to be able to purchase salty, low-fat, and sweet products, probably because competitive foods were generally more available in any venue at these schools. In suburban schools, 53.2% of students had access to 1 or more competitive venues compared with 44.2% in urban schools, 41.2% in townships, and 54.6% in rural schools (data not shown). The ethnic/racial composition of schools was not significantly associated with outcomes, and socioeconomic status (the percentage of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch) was not associated with outcomes other than less availability of healthier products in lower-income schools.\nThe multivariate models also revealed a consistent pattern of regional differences in student access to competitive food venues and the availability of products in those venues. Table 3 gives percentages of public school students with access to competitive food venues by US census region, as well as the availability of specific product types (salty, low-fat, sweet, and healthier items) in any com- petitive venue. Student access to foods in \u00e0 la carte lines and in any competitive food venue was more common in the South relative to all other regions, as was access to salty, low-fat, and sweet products. Restricting analyses to only those schools offering competitive foods, we found that the results continued to demonstrate greater availability of salty products in the South compared with the West and greater availability of sweet and low-fat products in the South compared with the Midwest and the West. However, healthy items, such as salads, vegetables, and fruits, were also more available in the South than in the Midwest."}, {"section_title": "COMMENT", "text": "By the 2009-2010 school year, approximately half of all public and private elementary school students could purchase foods in 1 or more competitive venues on campus. For public school students, the availability of regular-fat ice cream products decreased significantly over time; this was not accompanied by a corresponding increase in the availability of low-fat ice cream products. Student access to healthier options was limited, with approximately twothirds of students who had access to competitive food venues being able to purchase salads, vegetables, or fruits in any of those venues. Sweet products were widely available in competitive food venues; although candy was not widely available, other sweet items were commonly available, and almost all students who had access to competitive venues could purchase sugary products in those venues. Striking regional differences emerged for public school students, with greater access to competitive food venues in the South and greater access to salty and sweet products in these venues in the South. However, among public school students with access to competitive foods, those in the South also had greater availability of healthier foods compared with students in the Midwest or the West. These results are intriguing considering that childhood obesity rates are highest in the South. 16 Although schools in the South were more likely to offer healthy products, much work remains to remove unhealthy food products from these schools.\nNotably, student access to food in competitive venues did not change significantly over time in public schools; access decreased from 60% to 50% of students in private schools, although this was not statistically significant. This contrasts with our previously reported results showing a significant increase in student access to beverages in competitive venues during the same period. 17 Sales of food and beverage in competitive venues-particularly in \u00e0 la carte lines-can generate significant revenues to cover shortfalls in food service operating costs, 18, 19 and given recent economic pressures on school budgets, many schools and districts are seeking additional sources of revenue. However, schools can replace less healthy items with healthier items without loss of revenue, 20 and adding healthier competitive products may increase student participation in the school lunch program. 21, 22 Providing healthier foods and beverages is important to reinforce nutrition education messages and to bring schools into compliance with nutritional recommendations, while also providing a source of needed revenue for schools.\nAs with any survey that relies on reported rather than observed data, it is possible that our estimates were affected by various reporting biases; however, desirability bias would likely lead to decreased reporting of less healthy "}]
