[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The polar and subpolar realms in the Atlantic sector of the Northern Hemisphere are essential for the heat balance of the global climate system, because they regulate the renewal of deep ocean waters and carbon fluxes (Dickson and Brown, 1994;Ishii et al., 2014). Changes in ice-sheet and sea-ice extent in these regions are key in the global energy balance (Bitz et al., 2006;Ingram et al., 1989), and minor variations in their extension can shift the climate system towards a warm or cold climate mode (Clark et al., 1999;Gildor and Tziperman, 2000). Decline of the ice-covered regions in the Arctic is one of the most striking consequences of the recent anthropogenic climate warming (Stroeve et al., 2007). Satellite and historical in-situ observations provide limited temporal resolution (<150 years) (Titchner and Rayner, 2014) to fully understand the sensitivity of the ice-cover to rising temperatures and to foresee response of arctic ecosystems. Climate archives found in the sediment record, such as microfossils from marine microplankton, allow exploration of the natural climate variations and to have a long-trend term perspective of the changes in this ecosystem. Knowledge of the modern biogeography and ecology of those marine plankton organisms and of their relationships to the ice ecosystem is crucial to use these proxies as tracers of past seaice. Radiolarians (siliceous marine protist zooplankton) are significant components in the sediment record at high-latitudes, where carbonate microfossils are rarely preserved due either to dissolution or dilution by other sedimentary phases (Dittert et al., 1999). As such, they are one of the main indicators of past oceanographic conditions in these areas. The polycystine nassellarian Amphimelissa setosa is a radiolarian species that dominates radiolarian assemblages in the marginal Chukchi and Beaufort Seas in the Arctic Ocean (Dolan et al., 2014;Ikenoue et al., , 2019, characterized by the presence of seasonal sea-ice ( Fig. 1A). This species is also very common in different parts of the high-latitude North Atlantic, such as the Norwegian, Greenland, Iceland and Labrador Seas (Bj\u00f8rklund et al., 1998;Bj\u00f8rklund and Kruglikova, 2003;Molina-Cruz, 1991;Molina-Cruz and Bernal-Ram\u00edrez, 1996;Swanberg and Bj\u00f8rklund, 1987b). Several publications have attempted to characterize the ecological potential of this species using surface sediment samples (Bj\u00f8rklund and Kruglikova, 2003;Cortese et al., 2003;Kruglikova et al., 2007;MatuI and Yushina, 1999;Matul, 1989;Matul and Mohan, 2017;Molina-Cruz and Bernal-Ram\u00edrez, 1996;Swanberg and Bj\u00f8rklund, 1992), sediment traps Schr\u20ac oder-Ritzrau, 1995) and plankton tows (Bj\u00f8rklund and Swanberg, 1987;Ikenoue et al., , 2019Swanberg and Bj\u00f8rklund, 1987b;Swanberg and Eide, 1992). Different biotic and abiotic factors have been invoked as drivers of A. setosa modern distribution including mixing in the water column (Matul and Abelmann, 2005), temperature (Cortese et al., 2003;Molina-Cruz and Bernal-Ram\u00edrez, 1996), sea-ice, chlorophyll-a and silica concentrations (Dolan et al., 2014;Ikenoue et al., , 2019Swanberg and Eide, 1992) and fraction of sea-ice meltwater in the surface waters (Ikenoue et al., 2019). However, there is no quantitative determination on what are the main ecological drivers in its present-day and past distribution. The lack of consensus on which are the main ecological drivers of A. setosa distribution calls for a reanalysis of existing observations and an adequate synthesis using a systematic and quantitative approach, which may allow a better understanding of A. setosa as a potential environmental proxy. In addition, this species shows intraspecific morphological variability, displaying different shell patterns between samples from open ocean and fjord populations (Bj\u00f8rklund and Swanberg, 1987;Swanberg and Bj\u00f8rklund, 1987a), and size variability patterns between fossil individuals in the subarctic North Pacific and North Atlantic (Bj\u00f8rklund et al., 2015;Bj\u00f8rklund and Kruglikova, 2003;Matul and Abelmann, 2005). This suggests that a complex set of environmental factors are playing an important role in the shell architecture. Amphimelissa setosa was very common in the high-latitude North Pacific and its marginal seas since the Early Pleistocene, occurring in higher abundances during interglacial and deglacial periods (Ikenoue et al., 2016;Matsuzaki and Suzuki, 2018;Matul and Abelmann, 2005;Matul et al., 2002a;Okazaki et al., 2005), but it disappeared from the region between marine isotope stage (MIS) 5 and 4 (ca. 64e85 ka) (Matul and Abelmann, 2005). The reasons why A. setosa is no longer present in the North Pacific remain unresolved. By contrast, in the North Atlantic, the First occurrence (FO) of this species is recorded during MIS 11 (Bj\u00f8rklund et al., 2015) with higher abundances in glacial intervals (Bj\u00f8rklund et al., 2015(Bj\u00f8rklund et al., , 2019Matul, 1995;Matul and Abelmann, 2005;Matul and Yushina, 1999;Matul et al., 2002b). In this study, we use new and published plankton net and sediment trap data to characterize the optimum living depth and seasonal distribution of this species in the North Atlantic and the Arctic. We determine the best subset of variables that explains its distribution using multiple linear regressions in core-top data. We use this information to re-interpret the A. setosa records in both the North Atlantic and North Pacific basins as well as to infer the potential factors influencing the disappearance of A. setosa from the high-latitude North Pacific basin. We also compare various size measurements in modern and fossil A. setosa individuals from the North Atlantic and North Pacific basins to evaluate whether there are significant environmental pressures or different genetic populations related to the isolation of A. setosa in different regions."}, {"section_title": "Material and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Modern and fossil sedimentary datasets", "text": "We compiled the relative abundance on A. setosa in surface sediments from ten different sources ( Supplementary Table 1) distributed among the Greenland, Iceland, Norwegian Seas, and high-latitude North Atlantic, including the Labrador Sea, and Arctic Oceans (Chukchi and Beaufort Seas) (n \u00bc 201) ( Fig. 1A) covering the current spatial distribution of this species. Although some studies have reported trace abundances of A. setosa in both surface sediments and in the water column in the North Pacific, we consider these to be misidentifications or reworked individuals (see further explanations in Supplementary Material 1), and therefore they have not been included in this study. We used sediment trap data with relative abundance of A. setosa from four studies, three in the North Atlantic (Schr\u20ac oder- Ritzrau, 1995) and one in the Arctic Ocean   (Fig. 1B). Each sediment trap data yielded nearly one year of continuous data, with a sampling interval from 10 to 20 days (Table 1), which is suited for accurate determination of temporal occurrence of this species. Regarding the plankton tows, we include five stations in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas Itaki, 2003) and twelve in the Greenland and Iceland Seas (this study) ( Fig. 1B), with stratified plankton samples taken at different depth intervals between 500 and 0 m ( Table 2). The new plankton net datasets from Greenland Sea correspond to samples taken during the Arctic expeditions ARK VI/1e2 of RV \"Polarstern\" in 1989 (Krause et al., 1991). Methods for the analyses of these samples are described in Swanberg and Eide (1992). Samples were taken using Hydrobios stratified vertical multi-nets of 63 mm mesh size. Material recovered was dried at low-temperature, and mounted on microscope slides to count radiolaria. In all cases, whenever possible, at least 300 radiolarians were counted. We also used data on the relative abundance of polar planktonic foraminifera Neogloboquadrina pachyderma sinistral (Siccha and Kucera, 2017), ice-rafted debris (IRD) (Pirrung et al., 2002), and organic biomarker %C 37:4 (Rosell-Mel e, 1998) in surface sediments from the Greenland, Iceland and Norwegian Seas.

Hern andez-Almeida et al. / Quaternary Science Reviews 248 (2020) 106565 We obtained downcore A. setosa data from 10 cores in the North Atlantic, and 12 in the North Pacific and marginal seas, including an additional site with unpublished data (SO201-2-77 KL) in the Sea of Okhotsk ( Fig. 1B; Table 3). The sites in the high-latitude North Pacific are distributed between the Sea of Japan, Sea of Okhotsk, Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska. In the North Atlantic, cores were located in the Labrador Sea, south of Iceland, and the mid-latitude North Atlantic, as well as Nordic Seas. The spatial distribution of these sites, from coastal areas to open ocean, is ideal to track paleoenvironmental changes in both the North Pacific and the North Atlantic, such as shifts in the polar fronts or ice-sheet delivery to the ocean. Samples for micropaleontological analyses at Site SO201-2-77 KL were prepared following preparation technique described by Abelmann (1988) and Abelmann et al. (1999), using the sediment fraction of >40 mm. We used the previously published age-models for each site (Table 3). We additionally employed published size measurements on fossil (downcore) and modern (water column and surface sediment samples) A. setosa individuals from the North Atlantic and the North Pacific in order to study whether there were morphotypes that are typical of a particular region or related to specific environmental conditions. Although data stem from different publications, methodology for size measurements was consistent throughout all the studies, with morphological analyses performed on 30 individuals per sample (Bj\u00f8rklund et al., 2015;Bj\u00f8rklund and Swanberg, 1987;Matul and Abelmann, 2005). Cephalis height and width, and sagittal diameter were considered, and used for comparison purposes. Total height was also available, but it was discarded from our study data set because the bottom rim is fragile and can break off easily (Bj\u00f8rklund, personal communication), potentially providing misleading information."}, {"section_title": "Estimation of seasonality and depth habitat of Amphimelissa setosa", "text": "Living radiolarians inhabit a wide range of depths in the water column, from near the surface to hundreds of meters depth (Boltovskoy, 2017). Amphimelissa setosa has been observed in higher abundance at sub-surface depths (90e250 m) in plankton tows Itaki, 2003). We calculated the average living depth (ALD) of A. setosa in all stratified plankton tows following Rebotim et al. (2017), as the average of the mean depths of the sampling intervals where the species occurred, weighted by the species concentration in those intervals (individuals cm \u00c03 ). The combination of vertical plankton tow profiles with different spatial resolution in sampling intervals introduces some noise, but still provides a reliable overall estimate of the ALD (Greco et al., 2019). Because data of living radiolarians are not available for all the stations, our calculation of ALD is based on total radiolarians counts (living and dead). We estimated the preferred reproductive season of A. setosa based on the highest flux in the sediment traps studies in the Arctic  and the Greenland, Iceland and Norwegian Seas (Schr\u20ac oder-Ritzrau, 1995)."}, {"section_title": "Environmental data", "text": "Sea surface temperature (SST), salinity (Sal), apparent oxygen utilization (AOU), oxygen concentration (O) and the nutrient concentration of phosphate (Phos), silicate (Sil) and nitrate (Nit), were extracted from the corresponding mean ALD of all the plankton tows and preferred season using the 1 \u00c2 1 resolution World Ocean Database 2013 (WOD13) (Garcia et al., 2013;Locarnini et al., 2013;Zweng et al., 2013) and interpolated to the location of the surface sediment samples using weighted average gridding method in ODV v.4 (Schlitzer, 2004). All these data are provided in Supplementary  Table 1. In addition, we also extracted seasonal mixed layer depth (MLD) from Monthly Isopycnal & Mixed-layer Ocean Climatology (MIMOC) 2.2 (Schmidtko et al., 2013), and monthly chlorophyll-a (Chlor) data from for the complete period of satellite measurements of the MODIS mission (2003e2016) (https://oceancolor.gsfc. nasa.gov/l3/).

To achieve this, we ran multiple linear models using the relative abundance of this species in surface sediments and the environmental data at preferred growing season of A. setosa and ALD (Supplementary Table 1). The criterion to consider the best model is the one with the lowest Akaike's Information Criteria (AIC) number (Akaike, 1973) and lowest Cp statistic of Mallows (Montgomery and Peck, 1992). We used the functions 'regsubsets' (with 'exhaustive' method) and 'stepAIC' (with stepwise search argument as 'both') from the packages 'leaps' (Lumley and Lumley, 2013) and 'MASS' (Ripley et al., 2013), respectively, and 'ggplot2' (Hadley, 2015) for the graph preparation in R version 3.6.0 (R Core Team, 2019)."}, {"section_title": "Results and discussion", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Seasonal and vertical habitat of Amphimelissa setosa", "text": "The ALD of A. setosa in the Greenland and Iceland Seas, ranges between 267 and 82 m, and between 230 and 138 m at five stations in Chukchi and Beaufort Seas (Arctic Ocean). The average ALD of A. setosa across the four seas is 160 m (Table 2). Ideally, the environmental variables at the ALD would be more representative to characterize the habitat of A. setosa. However, many surface sediments do not have a plankton net sample nearby to infer its ALD, thus we use instead the global mean ALD of 160 m to extract the environmental data. The ALD of A. setosa in the Greenland Sea shows the largest variability of all the plankton net data set (267-82 m, see Table 2). This variation in ALD could be due to the competition with other silica organisms. When diatoms are more abundant in the surface layers, silica concentrations decrease due to more efficient uptake by this group, and A. setosa finds more suitable conditions (and higher silica concentrations) in deeper layers, where diatoms are absent (Biard and Ohman, 2020). Higher fluxes of A. setosa in sediment traps from the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas occur between August and November, while they occur in the Greenland and Norwegian Seas between August and October Schr\u20ac oder-Ritzrau, 1995) (Fig. 2). The latter region also shows smaller peaks in A. setosa during spring. The slight difference in the timing of the maximum abundance of A. setosa between Chukchi and Beaufort Seas, and Norwegian, Greenland, Iceland Seas indicates that the maxima abundance of A. setosa is time transgressive, taking place early in the south and later in the north. This is likely related to melting/retreat of sea-ice, as suggested by previous studies Swanberg and Eide, 1992) (Fig. 1A). The spring peak could represent early melting of sea-ice at lower latitude locations. Despite this slight offset, the fluxes of A. setosa during AugusteOctober are on average 1.7 to 3.5 times higher than during the rest of the months in both regions. The result of paired t-test (one-tailed) (Excel, Analysis ToolPak) shows that the mean fluxes of this species during AugusteOctober are significantly higher (at p < 0.05) than the mean fluxes during the rest of the months in which the sediment traps where deployed (Supplementary Material 2).

In the Barents Sea, A. setosa is present only west of Novaya Zemlya with abundances up to 77% (Bj\u00f8rklund and Kruglikova, 2003): the overall numbers of radiolaria are lower than in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas due to preservation issues. In the Greenland are of the Nordic Seas, this species has a marked preference for cold waters, with abundances above 60% peaking to 76% on the Iceland Plateau (Bj\u00f8rklund et al., 1998). In general A. setosa decreases in abundance eastwards as it meets with and submerges below the inflowing warm Atlantic water in the Nordic Seas, with values between 5 and 10-% close to the west coast of Norway. Lowest values (<5%) are found south of Iceland, and in the Labrador Sea and mid-latitude North Atlantic (Fig. 1A)."}, {"section_title": "Code", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Environmental factors controlling modern Amphimelissa setosa", "text": "Understanding the proxy value of a microfossil entails constraining the environmental (physical, chemical and biological) factors that determine its modern distribution. Using environmental data at the season and water depth in which A. setosa lives today (AugusteOctober and 160 m depth), we ran a multiple linear regression model with all the variables available. The best model explains 43% of the variance in the distribution of A. setosa in surface sediments (R 2 adj \u00bc 0.43, p < 0.05; lowest AIC \u00bc 1212.9 and Cp statistic of Mallows: 6), and includes SST, Sal, AOU and silicate at 160 m, chlorophyll-a between AugusteOctober and sea-ice concentration (Table 4). The most important contributor to the model is SST (Supplementary Material), while chlorophyll-a is not highly significant (p > 0.05), likely due to cofounding with other variables. This analysis reveals that bottom-up factors, such as nutrients, salinity and temperature, are the drivers most significantly associated with the distribution of A. setosa. This result is consistent with the study by Biard and Ohman (2020), which highlighted the importance of temperature, deep chlorophyll-a maximum and dissolved silica concentration influencing radiolarian populations living between 100 and 200 m depth in the water column. The unexplained variance in A. setosa distribution could be caused by the interaction of multiple biotic dependencies (e.g. preydepredator interactions, symbionts, parasitism) (Biard and Ohman, 2020), or preferential dissolution. Today, the Norwegian, Greenland and Iceland Seas are well mixed and isohaline areas with lower SST corresponding to deepwater formation occur (Swift and Aagaard, 1981) Figure 1). The importance of temperature for A. setosa agrees with previously observed temperature dependence of radiolarian assemblages in culture experiments (Anderson et al., 1988(Anderson et al., , 1990Matsuoka and Anderson, 1992) or in field observations (Abelmann et al., 1999;Boltovskoy and Correa, 2016;Cortese et al., 2005;Hernandez-Almeida et al., 2020;Matul and Mohan, 2017)."}, {"section_title": "(Supplementary", "text": "Amphimelissa setosa is rarely found in the central Arctic Ocean, which is usually covered by perennial sea-ice (Bj\u00f8rklund and Kruglikova, 2003), or in surface sediments in the proximity of the East Greenland continental shelf, usually covered by winter sea-ice. The absence of A. setosa in the same area could also reflect dissolution, as the East Greenland region shows low opal accumulation due to the intermittent perennial ice-cover (Schl\u00fcter et al., 2001). Its abundance (up to 78%) increases east of the Kolbeinsey Ridge (16 W), beyond the limits of the winter sea-ice. Swanberg and Eide (1992) found high abundances of juvenile and adult A. setosa along the ice-edge east of 16 W in boreal summer in the Greenland Sea, which were characterized by relatively cold temperatures, low salinity, high values of chlorophyll-a and phaeopigments. Ikenoue et al. (2019) has suggested that water freshening due to river runoff and sea-ice melting in the Arctic Ocean is an important factor for the proliferation of A. setosa, which may influence the main source of food supply for radiolarians. Abundances of A. setosa up to 100% are observed in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas and are related to a cold waters masses along the sea-ice edge during boreal summer (Dolan et al., 2014;Ikenoue et al., , 2019Itaki et al., 2003). The proximity of the ice-edge causes enhanced vertical mixing which supplies higher concentrations of nutrients (such as nitrate and silicate) than ice-free areas, and stimulates primary productivity (Apollonio, 1973;Assmy et al., 2013). Interestingly, we find that the silicate concentration at 160 m is a variable significant to the distribution of A. setosa in surface sediments. Silica concentration is also correlated with sea-ice concentration (R \u00bc 0.72, p < 0.001, Supplementary Material). In the Beaufort Sea, silica concentrations are generally higher below 100 m, and a mid-depth maximum between 125 and 200 m depth is found at the upper halocline (Varela et al., 2016). Major sources of silica at the surface waters included the Mackenzie River and seaice, and Bering Sea waters at the subsurface (Varela et al., 2016). Amphimelissa setosa dominates the radiolarian assemblages (up to 100% in the East Siberia Sea) in areas with high concentrations of subsurface silica, suggesting the importance of this nutrient in controlling the species distribution. It is generally assumed that high dissolved silica content enhances silicification of polycystines and, thus, also controls the distribution of species. However, this has not been observed in short-term laboratory experiments: radiolarian skeletons do not show any significant response to increases in dissolved silica (Sugiyama and Anderson, 1997;Suzuki et al., 2013). Culture  (Sugiyama and Anderson, 1997). However, these culture experiments were only successful for some tropical species and, therefore, we cannot be certain of whether these results can be generalized to all radiolarian species. In more recent experiments using fluorescence methods, which are more sensitive to differences in silicification, it was observed that growth stages of certain polycystine species can produce variations in the skeletal thickness of different parts of the shell (Ogane et al., 2010). Field studies have not shown evidence of any significant relationship between dissolved silica and radiolarian species abundance or degree of silicification so far (Suzuki and Not, 2015). It is feasible that the relationship of subsurface silica and A. setosa abundance derives from indirect mechanisms, such as food web processes involving predation on siliceous phytoplankton, as has been observed in other subsurface radiolarian species (Biard and Ohman, 2020). This would also explain the significance of AOU, which is a measure of how much oxygen has been taken up by sea life (Garcia et al., 2009), and chlorophyll-a, which are both related to the primary production in the ocean. Dissolved silica is limiting for diatoms, and retreating and melting of the ice-edge in high latitudes make this nutrient available for phytoplankton producers adapted to these conditions (Jin et al., 2007;Syvertsen, 1991), such as some diatoms species (Fryxell, 1989;Weckstr\u20ac om et al., 2020) and perhaps radiolarians. In iceberg production areas, it has been observed that icesheet meltwaters are exporting large quantities of reactive silica, which could be used by planktonic organisms (Duprat et al., 2016;Hawkings et al., 2017;Hopwood et al., 2020) into the ocean. Diatom blooms, together with high density of radiolarians, have been observed in west-Norwegian fjords covered with sea-ice during winter and receiving glacial meltwater during early spring (Bj\u00f8rklund, 1974;Bj\u00f8rklund et al., 2008;Bj\u00f8rklund, 1986, 1987b). In such cases, a high density of A. setosa could indicate a direct or indirect trophic dependency between this radiolarian species and phytoplankton related to glacial meltwater in these fjords. Besides the significance of SST, Sal, AOU, silica, chlorophyll-a and sea-ice for A. setosa, the relative abundance of this species shows a positive correlation with IRD concentration (R \u00bc 0.49, p < 0.001), and relative abundance of N. pachyderma sin. (R \u00bc 0.46, p < 0.001), %C 37:4 (R \u00bc 0.67, p < 0.001) in surface sediments in the high-latitude North Atlantic and marginal basins of the Arctic Ocean (Fig. 3AeC). Because we interpolated the proxy data to the locations of the surface sediment samples with A. setosa data, some of the correlation plots show certain concentration of points which do not show correlation to A. setosa percentages, for example at high values of N. pachyderma sin. (90e100%). Alternatively, this could represent different ecological sensitivities of A. setosa to the conditions represented by these proxies. Neogloboquadrina pachyderma sin. is the dominant species north of the Arctic front, with percentages up to 90%. This species is able to live below the sea-ice, and shows that the highest absolute abundances along the summer ice margin, parameters which are related to high primary production (Carstens et al., 1997). High abundance of %C 37:4 (>5%) in sediments and the water column is associated with the influence of freshwater from sea-ice and/or icebergs in polar and sub-polar waters (Bendle et al., 2005;Harada et al., 2003;Rosell-Mel e, 1998;Seki et al., 2005). Deposition of IRD in sediments occurs with the melting of ice (continental and/or sea-ice) (Pirrung et al., 2002;Ruddiman, 1977), which also delivers nutrients to the surface ocean (Apollonio, 1973;Duprat et al., 2016). Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that in the past A. setosa's species-proxy relationships were similar to those of today. We conclude that the combination of late boreal summer/autumn environmental variables, such as SST, sea-ice productivity-related factors, that favour proliferation of A. setosa, must have occurred also in the highlatitude North Atlantic and North Pacific in the past, when A. setosa was abundant and there were increases in indirect polar indicators such as the abundance of N. pachyderma sin., IRD and % C 37:4 ."}, {"section_title": "Exploring the morphological variability of Amphimelissa setosa populations", "text": "Fossil A. setosa individuals in downcore samples from the North   Table 4 Final model statistics, significance of the parameters and AIC of alternative models including (\u00fe) or excluding (\u00c0) parameters. Atlantic and the North Pacific basins show some differences in morphological characteristics. Overall, the relationship between cephalis width and height in populations from the two basins have similar slope but different intercepts as shown in Fig. 4A and B. Sea of Okhotsk specimens have significantly larger cephalis width and height (two-samples t-test, p < 0.05, Supplementary Material) compared to the North Atlantic ones (Fig. 4A and B), while for the sagittal diameter, the differences are not significant. Interestingly, morphological measurements of A. setosa for MIS 10 samples (374e337 ka) in Site U1314 are more similar to those in the Sea of Okhotsk, in particular for samples from MIS 11 (424 ka), 9 (337 ka) and 7e (243 ka). Amphimelissa setosa appeared in North Atlantic sediment records during transition MIS 11/10, possibly migrating from the North Pacific (Bj\u00f8rklund et al., 2015). This is indicated by a peak of~65% at MIS 10/9 transition (347 ka) in Site U1314 (Fig. 5a). The similarity of A. setosa size in the Sea of Okhotsk and North Atlantic fossil samples between MIS 11-9 suggests that A. setosa populations in the Sea of Okhotsk shared morphological characteristics with the ones that migrated first to the North Atlantic. On the contrary, samples between MIS 4 and 2 had smaller sizes. On glacial/interglacial time-scales, Cortese and Bj\u00f8rklund (1997) observed differences in size in radiolarian species Actinomma boreale in the Norwegian Sea, with the decreasing size from the Younger Dryas towards the Holocene negatively correlated to SST. This is opposite to test size trends observed in surface sediments from the Norwegian Sea (64-62 N; 6-4 E) to the Iceland Plateau (68-66 N; 24 -8 W) where size and July SST were positively correlated. This indicates that not only SST, but other factors such as nutrients and productivity might be responsible for the changes in size in A. boreale in the North Atlantic, and the same might apply for skeletal size differences in A. setosa. Measurement of sagittal diameter and cephalis height allows us to distinguish four different groups of samples with similar slopes but different intercepts (Fig. 4C).

The North Atlantic and Iceland populations fall between the other two, with the Sea of Okhotsk and the Norwegian Sea populations having the smallest and the largest sagittal diameter, respectively. These differences may be due to the genetic plasticity of A. setosa in response to the specific environmental characteristics of each region. Bj\u00f8rklund and Swanberg (1987) identified two morphotypes of A. setosa, one with reticulated pore ornamentation  (Bj\u00f8rklund et al., 2015) and IRD grains (brown) (Alvarez Zarikian et al., 2009), (B) Site P-172 (Matul and Abelmann, 2005), (C) Site L-254 (Matul et al., 2002b); (D) Site MK-340 (Matul and Yushina, 1999), (E) Site MK-316 (Matul, 1994); and the Nordics Seas (right), (F) Site GIK23259-2 (Schr\u20ac oder-Ritzrau, 1995) and N. pachyderma sin.

(For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the Web version of this article.) associated with the Norwegian fjords (see images in Supplementary Material 1), and another with a more compact appearance typical of open ocean conditions. They hypothesized the fjord morphotypes to be related to the high temperature (>7 C), high production, competition for resources, and rapid growth conditions in the fjords. This reticulated form, or \"rapid growth\" morphotype, was not observed by Swanberg and Eide (1992) in the cold water assemblage close to the ice-edge in Greenland Sea, where the water temperatures were mostly below 0 C (and summer temperatures between 4 and 5 C). If both Greenland, Iceland and Norwegian Seas populations of A. setosa shared a common arctic ancestor (Bj\u00f8rklund et al., 2015), the clear differences in skeletal construction (Bj\u00f8rklund and Swanberg, 1987), and morphology (Fig. 4D) suggest large endemism and genetic plasticity among the populations (sympatric speciation) dwelling in different parts of the North Atlantic Ocean. This process might have been favoured by character displacement during early stages of sympatric speciation (Brown and Wilson, 1956) due to the different environmental conditions at each region and competitive interactions among different radiolarian species. The ability of A. setosa to successfully disperse across different basins for extended periods of time appears to be a common ability in other planktonic organisms (Nelson et al., 2009;Reid et al., 2007;Sexton and Norris, 2008). If geographic isolation persisted over significant periods of time, some genes that control skeletal morphology might change, creating new morphotypes (allopatric speciation) (Norris, 2000). Differences in cephalic size and sagittal diameter between fossil and modern Iceland Plateau, Norwegian Sea and high-latitude North Atlantic populations are clear, and they persist when compared with extinct populations in the Sea of Okhotsk (Fig. 4). This would indicate that genetic drift and allopatric speciation, together with variation in environmental factors (temperature, salinity, food source), may account for some of the observed morphological differences in A. setosa, as it has been hypothesized for other radiolarian species belonging to the genus Actinomma with similar migration history (Kruglikova et al., 2009). These morphological variations should be further investigated, in particular the size of the cephalis, as they seem to be useful markers to trace past differences in environmental parameters through time."}, {"section_title": "Paleoenvironmental significance of A. setosa in core sediments", "text": "From the statistical results that show a preference for certain environmental variables at a specific season and depth (AugusteOctober, 160 m depth), and the surface distribution patterns of A. setosa in the modern Arctic Ocean and Nordic Seas, we argue that the distribution of this species relates to subsurface nutrients (mainly silicate) and temperature at subsurface waters as well as to productivity linked to the proximity of ice-edge. We evaluate the significance of the records of A. setosa in multiple sites of the high-latitude Northern Hemisphere across the Pleistocene compared to other independent proxies."}, {"section_title": "Assessing the relationship of Amphimelissa setosa with meltwater events: analysis of North Atlantic records", "text": "The oldest presence of A. setosa in the high-latitude North Atlantic and Nordic Seas, migrated from the North Pacific, is recorded at IODP Site U1314 at 413.9 ka during the sea-level high stands at Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 11, although in very low percentages (Bj\u00f8rklund et al., 2015). The species rose to 60% during MIS 10 and 9 at Site U1314, reaching also very high percentages in the Labrador Sea and mid-latitude North Atlantic during the same time interval (Bj\u00f8rklund et al., 2015) (Fig. 5A). The high percentages of A. setosa during MIS 10 in the North Atlantic coincide with high abundances of the polar planktonic foraminifera N. pachyderma sin. (Johannessen et al., 1994), which occurred together with increased content of IRD in several cores located in the subpolar North Atlantic (Kandiano and Bauch, 2003;St. John et al., 2004). The abundance A. setosa decreases between MIS 9 to MIS 4, and increases again from MIS 4 to MIS 2, which coincides with steady higher abundance of IRD (Fig. 5A). The higher IRD content in the North Atlantic during MIS 10, 4 and 2 indicates the collapse and melting of Circum-Atlantic ice-sheets (Alvarez Zarikian et al., 2009). Such meltwater could have supplied large amounts of silicic acid to the ocean, which could have sustained higher primary productivity along the marginal ice zone, promoting the proliferation of high numbers of A. setosa. Additionally, sediment cores in the mid and high-latitude North Atlantic, L254, P-172 and MK-340 ( Fig. 5BeE), show peaks of A. setosa, between 15 and 10 ka, which coincide with higher silica concentration in the ocean supplied by melting glaciers from Greenland (Hawkings et al., 2018). At sites in the Barents Slope (Site GIK23259-2) ( Fig. 5F) and V\u00f8ring Plateau (Sites GIK23071 and GIK23411-5) (Fig. 5F, H-I), A. setosa show increases between 12e8 ka, concurrent with the dominance of N. pachyderma sin. (50e70%). This correspondence indicates that these intervals were characterized by the intrusion of cold arctic waters in the Nordic Seas, and potentially the presence of sea-ice in that region (Carstens et al., 1997;Jensen, 1998) (Fig. 5FeH). The radiolarian record in the core JM99-1200, recovered in Andfjord in northern Norway, shows a rapid transition from high to low A. setosa abundances between the Younger Dryas and the Holocene. This also coincides with a reduction in ice-rafted debris, and lower seasonal sea-ice concentration inferred from the organic biomarker-derived proxy P B IP 25 ( Fig. 5J) (Bj\u00f8rklund et al., 2019;Cabedo-Sanz et al., 2013). We suggest that higher abundance of A. setosa reflects cold SST, seasonal sea-ice, together with higher silicic acid input to the fjord by glacier meltwater. The same has been observed in fjords in Greenland and Svalbard (Halbach et al., 2019;Meire et al., 2016)."}, {"section_title": "The onset of Amphimelissa setosa in the North Pacific", "text": "The lineage of A. setosa in the family Cannobotryidae is unknown and there is no information about any ancestors in the North Pacific. In the Bering Sea, single specimens of A. setosa were found at 4e2.4 Ma at Sites U1341 (Ikenoue et al., 2016) and at U1340 (Zhang et al., 2014). The sporadic occurrence of this species in Pliocene and Early Pleistocene sediment records is not robust enough as to be considered a biostratigraphic marker. However, the increase of this species since 1.48 Ma is consistent across different regions in the North Pacific and marginal seas. Therefore, we prefer to use the term First Common Occurrence (FCO) to refer to the earliest common presence of A. setosa in the North Pacific, following (Ikenoue et al., 2016). The oldest FCO of A. setosa was determined at 1.48 Ma (Fig. 6A) at IODP Site U1417, in the northeastern Pacific (Gulf of Alaska), which is almost the same as for the Sea of Japan, recorded at 1.47 Ma (Kamikuri et al., 2017; (Fig. 6D). In the Sea of Okhotsk, the FCO of A. setosa was found at 1.1 Ma (Matul and Abelmann, 2005;Matul et al., 2002a) (Fig. 6F), while in the Bering Sea, at 990e980 ka (Ikenoue et al., 2016) (Fig. 6G). Notably, the FCO of A. setosa across the high-latitude North Pacific coincides with an increase in the arctic-water indicator % C 37:4 at around 1.5e1.1 Ma in the whole basin (IODP sites U1417, U1341 and ODP site 882) (Fig. 6D, H-I) (Horikawa et al., 2015;Mart\u00ednez-Garcia et al., 2010;McClymont et al., 2008;M\u00fcller et al., 2018). Peaks in A. setosa abundance at Site U1417 between 1.48 and 1 Myr coincide with higher bio-siliceous primary productivity and IRD activity (Fig. 6AeC). Multi-proxy evidence at Site U1417 indicates that biosiliceous productivity (as seen by opal and diatom I. Hern andez-Almeida et al. / Quaternary Science Reviews 248 (2020) 106565 concentration) was strongly controlled by continental dust and icerafting processes supplying micro and macro nutrients necessary to stimulate productivity (M\u00fcller et al., 2018). The Arctic sea-ice biomarker and diatom proxies from the Bering Sea show also substantial expansion in sea-ice through both glacials and interglacials from around 1.1 Ma, with seasonal advances and retreats of sea-ice controlling primary productivity (Detlef et al., 2018;Horikawa et al., 2015;Stroynowski et al., 2017;Teraishi et al., 2016). Larger amplitude SST variations are also observed after 1.1 Ma at Site U1425, in the Sea of Japan (Wittkopp et al., 2017). The increasing IRD accumulation rates and larger amplitude fluctuations in distal sites in the open ocean North Pacific ODP Site 887 and DSDP 580 since 1.2 Ma suggest a southward shift of the subarctic front (St. John and Krissek, 1999). Consequently, the rapid increase of A. setosa in several sites across the North Pacific and marginal seas corresponds to a cooling trend and is coincident with an increase in sea-ice and iceberg dynamics. This reflects that the FCO and early distribution of A. setosa was bound to the gradual expansion of polar waters and southward shift of the marginal ice zone, and supply of nutrients by melting ice across the North Pacific, being the Sea of Okhotsk the last region colonised. These conditions must have been similar to the Arctic and subpolar North Atlantic in which A. setosa is found today. Despite the fact that A. setosa first appeared related to a climate cooling and a southward expansion of arctic conditions in the North Pacific, the distribution of A. setosa in Late Pleistocene sediments in the Sea of Okhotsk and Bering Sea is generally related to warm intervals and deglacial periods (Matul and Abelmann, 2005;Matul et al., 2002a). In core MD01-2415, located in the Sea of Okhotsk, high percentages of A. setosa (>30%) are observed during deglaciation at the same time or fairly closely following IRD discharge events a primary productivity proxies (opal and Diol index) MD01-2414 (Lattaud et al., 2019) (Fig. 7AeD). The Diol index is a proxy for the abundance of the diatom genus Proboscia, which in these settings is likely linked to nutrient availability (dissolved silica) (Lattaud et al., 2019). Deglacial productivity pulses in this region are controlled by a northward retreat of the sea-ice margins which allowed light to penetrate in the water column (N\u00fcrnberg and Tiedemann, 2004). These conditions together with higher nutrient (silica) concentration from the Amur River fluvial discharge, ice-rafting and vertical mixing promoted higher productivity (Iwasaki et al., 2012;N\u00fcrnberg and Tiedemann, 2004), favouring the presence of A. setosa in the Sea of Okhotsk. At Site SO201-2-77 KL, in the Bering Sea, the A. setosa record is very similar to those in the Sea of Okhotsk, and higher opal percentage at 125 ka (MIS 5e) coincides with a peak in A. setosa (>30%), indicating that productivity is controlled by analogous processes (Fig. 7E and F). The northward migration of the sea-ice edge and summer melt of marginal ice zones likely promoted upper ocean stratification, enough to foster a pulse of phytoplankton growth but not strong enough to prevent sustained growth via the resupply of nutrients from below (Kienast et al., 2004). The preference of A. setosa for warmer climate intervals is illustrated by the robust negative correlation between downcore A. setosa abundances in the North Pacific since MIS 16 (~676 ka) and the d 18 O values of the benthic stack d 18 O (Lisiecki and Raymo, 2005), taken as an indication of global ice volume (Fig. 8A). That inverse relationship, which is observed in the Bering Sea and Sea of Okhotsk sites, suggests that a common mechanism driving A. setosa distribution was operating in both marginal basins and it is likely related to increased productivity at the marginal ice-zone. Exceptions are Sites U1425 and U1417. For the first one, in the Sea of Japan, the correlation between A. setosa and benthic d 18 O is positive. This is explained because Site U1425, as well as U1429 in the East China Sea, are located in a more southern position, and therefore optimal conditions for A. setosa (likely in the form of icerafted for the U1429), reached those latitudes only during very cold glacials. For the second one, in the Gulf of Alaska, productivity pulses occurred during glacial and interglacial periods (M\u00fcller Fig. 6.

Numbers in parenthesis correspond to the code number in Table 3. The sites are ordered chronologically, from the oldest occurrence of A. setosa in the North Pacific at the bottom (i.e. U1417), to the youngest one (i.e. U1341) in the upper part.

Hern andez-Almeida et al. / Quaternary Science Reviews 248 (2020) 106565 et al., 2018), as well as the peaks in A. setosa, suggesting that local factors exert a major influence in the timing and extension of the ice-marginal zone in the Gulf of Alaska. The interglacial signature observed in downcore records of A. setosa in the Bering Sea and Sea of Okhotsk contrast with the distribution in the high-latitude North Atlantic and Nordic Seas, which shows a positive correlation and thus preference for glacial conditions (Fig. 8A). Only a couple of sites located in the Norwegian Sea (GIK23424-3, GIK23259-2) do not show this positive correlation. This is explained because these sites only cover the last ca. 11 ka, and therefore benthic d 18 O values are <3.5\u2030, typical of interglacial conditions (McManus et al., 1999). In contrast to the Late Pleistocene-Holocene records, Mid-and Early Pleistocene records do not show a particular preference of this taxa for glacial or interglacial intervals (Fig. 8B, Sites U1417, U1341, U1425, and MD01-2415). Prior to the Mid-Pleistocene Transition (MPT), during the 41kyr world (MIS 22e28), orbital climate variability does not show large amplitude changes (Clark et al., 2006). Biogeochemical proxies in the Bering Sea reveal that orbital fluctuations of the seaice margin were small during winter and summer (Detlef et al., 2018); therefore A. setosa could survive during either glacial or interglacial intervals, always being close to the ice margin. The onset of the 100-kyr glacial/interglacial cycles at the MPT is marked by a rapid transition from seasonal to perennial sea-ice conditions during glacials (Detlef et al., 2018) which decreased primary productivity (Kim et al., 2014;N\u00fcrnberg and Tiedemann, 2004), and limited the presence of A. setosa to interglacial and deglacial periods. We can conclude that the occurrence of A. setosa during either glacial or interglacial conditions across the Pleistocene in different parts of the Northern Hemisphere highlights the adaptive capacity of this species to follow spatial migrations of the marginal ice-zone and related factors (high productivity and low temperature) regardless of the global climate conditions (Fig. 9)."}, {"section_title": "The dawn of Amphimelissa setosa in the North Pacific", "text": "High resolution records from the Bering Sea and Sea of Okhotsk show peaks of A. setosa during MIS 5e (123 ka), and also high values during MIS 5c (96 ka) and MIS 5a (82 ka). The relative abundance of A. setosa declined towards the beginning of MIS 4, until it finally disappeared from the North Pacific and its epicontinental seas (Fig. 10). The last occurrence (LO) of A. setosa is diachronous across the subarctic North Pacific. It disappeared earlier in the Sea of Okhotsk (e.g. MD01-2415) and the Gulf of Alaska (Site U1417), than in the Sea of Japan (Site U1425) and the Bering Sea (Site U1341) where A. setosa found a refuge (Table 3). Modern high-latitude North Pacific and North Atlantic basin differ in their upper water column oceanographic structure. Whereas the North Atlantic is well mixed, the North Pacific has strong salinity and temperature gradients in the uppermost 200 m, leading to a steep thermocline/ halocline and pronounced stratification in the upper water column (Yang and Honjo, 1996) (Supplementary Figure 1). This stratification limits the supply of nutrients to the upper photic zone (Gargett, 1991). We suggest two non-exclusive mechanisms to explain the disappearance of A. setosa in the North Pacific basin: the development of perennial sea-ice conditions and shortages of silica. The increasing values of %C 37:4 in the central Sea of Okhotsk since 85 ka are indicative of lower salinities (Seki et al., 2005) and reach their highest values at 64 ka coinciding with the LO of A. setosa in this marginal sea (Matul and Abelmann, 2005). The supply of large amounts of freshwater at the MIS 5a/4 transition from Amur River (Fig. 10K), in combination with lower SST (Hernandez-Almeida et al., 2020;Lattaud et al., 2019;Seki et al., 2004), promoted extension of the near-perennial sea-ice cover from west to east in the Sea of Okhotsk (N\u00fcrnberg et al., 2011;Sakamoto et al., 2005;Vasilenko et al., 2019). Abrupt changes in diatom d 30 Si and decreasing opal concentration were recorded at the MIS 5a/4 transition in the northwest Pacific, indicating a nutrient exhaustion or limited supply of silicic acid (Fig. 10K) linked to the establishment of a steep modern-like halocline (Swann and Snelling, 2015), which prevented deeper water mixing. Limitation in the nutrient renewal directly impacted the phytoplankton and caused a reduction primary productivity in the high-latitude North Pacific (Sancetta and Silvestri, 1986).

At around 1.5e1 Ma atmospheric reorganization and enhanced polar circulation caused a southward sea-ice expansion, and a gradual development of the marginal ice zone in the entire North Pacific, with the Sea of Okhotsk being the last region consistently colonized by A. setosa. This taxon showed an exceptional adaptive capacity to follow the temporal and spatial migrations of the marginal ice zone and related factors (i.e., high primary productivity and low temperature) regardless of the global climate conditions. Prior to the MPT, A. setosa could survive close to the ice margin during either glacial or interglacial intervals. However, during MPT and Late Pleistocene A. setosa showed preference for interglacial and deglacial periods in records from the Bering Sea and Sea of Okhotsk, suggesting common mechanisms linked to the presence of sea-ice or ice-rafting. The distribution of this species in the mid and late Pleistocene differ between ocean basins. The enhanced polar atmospheric circulation influenced by changes in ocean ice cover during MIS 4 promoted lower surface salinity, strong upper stratification and a decrease in productivity in the Sea of Okhotsk and high-latitude North Pacific. These conditions were intensified in the northwest Pacific, where the lack of a well-developed deep mixed layer and silica deprivation in the water column might have triggered the early disappearance of A. setosa in the subarctic Pacific. These conditions seem not have occurred in the high latitude North Atlantic Ocean, where this species migrated to and found a suitable habitat to dwell since MIS 11. There are large differences in size measurements between fossil and modern specimens of A. setosa in the Iceland Plateau, Norwegian Sea and high-latitude North Atlantic populations. Fossil individuals in downcore samples from the North Atlantic and the North Pacific show variations in morphological features. Differences are less marked between MIS 10 individuals from the North Atlantic and MIS 11e5 from the North Pacific, suggesting that genetic differentiation of ecological adaptation was very gradual. The differences in modern A. setosa populations reflect great endemism and genetic plasticity among the populations living in different parts of the North Atlantic Ocean. These morphological variations could be potential useful markers in future studies to trace differences in environmental parameters through time. There are still unanswered questions regarding the modern and past ecological distribution of A. setosa in the high latitude oceans. Further studies investigating the occurrence of A. setosa in southern high-latitude locations, could help to better delimitate extension of sea-ice/ice-rafting in the high-latitude Northern Hemisphere. Moreover, lack of well-preserved opal records in the Arctic basin that cover the Middle and late Pleistocene limits the understanding of the inter-ocean migrations of A. setosa, which might have been analogous to other planktonic groups (e.g. Neodenticula seminae, Miettinen et al., 2013;Reid et al., 2007), and can shed light on the connection between North Pacific and North Atlantic during sealevel high stands, as well as changes in Arctic sea-ice cover.
