We examined diabetes because it is an ambulatory sensitive condition for which good primary care should reduce hospitalizations. 10, 11 To address the concern that NPs deliver care to healthier and less complex patients, 6, 12 we used a range of statistical approaches, including multivariable analyses, inverse probability of treatment weighting with a propensity score, nonpooling propensity score adjustment, nonpooling propensity score matching, and instrumental variable (IV) analysis. We examined 2 outcomes not expected to vary substantially by model of care to explore any persistence of residual confounding. Finally, we conducted sensitivity analyses to estimate the potential impact of unmeasured residual confounding.

We chose the NP cohort from 100% data to ensure sufficient power for our proposed analyses on the within state comparisons.\nThe MD cohort was selected from a 5% sample of national Medicare data using the diabetes indicator from CCDW. Patients with at least 2 outpatient E&M services from generalists and no outpatient E&M services from NPs in a given year were classified as receiving MD care only.\nIndividual NP and MD cohorts were established for each year in 2007-2010. We conducted both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses with these cohorts. For the crosssectional analyses, we pooled the 4 annual cohorts. In this analysis, each patient could have multiple records. In the longitudinal analyses, we defined the model of care, NP or MD, in 1 year (2007, 2008, 2009) , and the outcome was assessed in the next year.

Elixhauser comorbidities were chosen because they are not influenced by primary care practice styles 17 and they predict mortality, morbidity, and health care utilization outcomes. 16 We also included as comorbidities diagnoses that are potential complications of diabetes, such as retinopathy, neuropathy, kidney disease, and uncontrolled diabetes, such as hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, and ketoacidosis (see Appendix 2, Supplemental Digital Content 2, http://links.lww.com/MLR/A994, for specific diagnoses codes).

First, we adjusted for decile of propensity score and year in the model. Second, we matched the patients cared for by primary care physicians to those cared for by NPs with a 1:1 ratio without replacement. We used a matching algorithm based on the nearest Mahalanobis metric within the calipers of width equal to 0.25 of the SD of the logit of the nonpooling propensity score. 28, 29 About 92.3% of patients receiving primary care from NPs were matched to those cared for by physicians. We examined the assumptions for use of propensity score analyses, including overlap, balance, and ability to assess comparability of estimates across deciles (Appendix 4, Supplemental Digital Content 4, http://links.lww.com/MLR/A996 and 5, Supplemental Digital Content 5, http://links.lww.com/MLR/ A997). Patients with propensity scores in the overlap regions within each state (99.3% of the cohort) were included in the models. We also calculated propensity scores from pooled samples and used it to conduct IPTW analyses. The inverse of the propensity score was used to weight each patient in the NP group, and the inverse of one minus the propensity score was used to weight each patient in the MD group. States were included as a fixed effect."}, {"section_title": "IV Analysis", "text": "We explored the use of 2 IVs: the proportion of diabetes patients who received care from an NP by Hospital Referral Region (HRR, n = 306), and whether a state required physician supervision of NPs for practice and prescriptions (n = 51). 3 We coded the states requiring physician supervision of both practice and prescription as \"1\"; otherwise as \"0\" based on our previous study. 3 Primary care provider availability was included in all of the IV analyses because it is related to NP availability and also may be related to the outcomes. 3 The number of primary care physicians per 100,000 residents in the Hospital Service Area was obtained from the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care for 2006, the closest year available for our study period. The number of physician assistants per 100,000 residents in the county in 2007 and 2010 was obtained from the 2011-2012 Area Resource File. Both IVs were strongly associated with having an NP as a primary care provider (partial F test = 83794.0, P < 0.0001; partial F test = 3145.5, P < 0.0001). Two different estimation methods, 2-stage residual inclusion (2SRI) and IV probit models, [30] [31] [32] were used for the IV analyses. The 2SRI model estimates the effect of care by NPs on potentially preventable hospitalization by estimating residuals of prediction of having NP care from the first-stage logistic regression model adjusted for covariates. These residuals plus receipt of care by NP and additional covariates were then included into the second-stage GEE model to estimate the difference in hospitalization between patients cared for by NPs and physicians. The IV probit model is similar to the 2SRI model but uses probit models in both stages."}, {"section_title": "Evaluation of Analytical Approaches", "text": "To assess the validity of the different analytic methods, we calculated standardized difference scores, which demonstrate the balance of measured covariates between 2 groups and are independent of sample size. The standardized Patients in the NP group were identified from 100% Medicare patients who received all of their primary care from NPs.\nc Patients in the MD group were identified from a 5% national sample of Medicare patients.\nd For OREC (Original Reason for Entitlement Code), \"0\" meant that the beneficiary's original entitlement to Medicare benefits was not specified as disability or end-stage renal disease.\ne The beneficiary was not continuously enrolled in Medicare Part A and B, or was enrolled in an HMO in the prior or the study year.\nf In the study year, NP selection criteria were that the beneficiary had at least 2 outpatient visits to NPs (specialty code: 50) and no visits to generalist physicians (specialty codes: 01, 08, 11, 38).\ng MD selection criteria were that the beneficiary had at least 2 visits to generalist physicians and no visits to NPs. CMS CCDW indicates CMS Chronic Disease Data Warehouse; MD, physician primary care providers; NP, nurse practitioners. We also examined the persistence of residual confounding in our analyses. We chose 2 outcomes not anticipated to differ between patients who received primary care from NPs versus physicians: total mortality and hospitalizations for conditions not classified as potentially preventable. The 4-year mortality difference between the 2 groups was examined using a Cox proportional hazard model.\nTo estimate the potential impact of residual unmeasured confounders, we conducted sensitivity analyses. 34 We postulated an unmeasured confounder with absolute differences of 5%, 10%, and 20% in levels of prevalence. These prevalence estimates were chosen because, except for urban versus rural location, all the absolute differences in the prevalence of known confounders between the NP and physician groups were <20% (Table 1) . For each prevalence value, a range of effect sizes (ORs of 1.5, 2.5, and 3.5 for the unmeasured confounder) were selected. Most of the known confounders had effect sizes (ORs) ranging from 0.80 to 2.85, with most below 2.0 (Appendix 7, Supplemental Digital Content 7, http://links.lww.com/MLR/A999). The estimated difference in outcomes between the 2 groups was determined using multivariable analyses with further adjustment for the unknown confounder.\nFinally, to assess whether the assumption of the impact of NP care on outcomes varied by complexity of patient conditions and residential area, we tested the interaction between NP care and the number of Elixhauser comorbidities and the interaction between NP care and rural/urban residence, in the GEE model and conditional logistic models. We performed all analyses using SAS v.9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC)."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": "The 4 annual study cohorts included 93,443 Medicare patients with diabetes who received all their primary care from NPs (136,348 person-years) and 252,376 patients with diabetes who received all their primary care from physicians (553,890 person-years). Table 1 presents the characteristics of patients, stratified by type of primary care provider. Because of the large sample sizes, even small differences between the 2 groups were statistically significant. The last column presents the standardized difference for each covariate. Manyincluding Medicaid enrollment, race/ethnicity, number of provider visit in prior year, hypertension, rural location, and year-were >10%, indicating imbalance. 35 We calculated the standard difference between the NP and physician groups for the multivariable analyses, nonpooling propensity adjustment and matching, and IV analyses. As shown in Appendix 6 (Supplemental Digital Content 6, http://links.lww.com/MLR/A998), the standardized differences for all patient characteristics were substantially smaller for the nonpooling propensity matched cohort (r2.1%) than for the unadjusted differences of the entire study cohort. For the 2 IV approaches, the standardized differences remained large ( > 20%) for at least 2 variables. Table 2 shows the association of care by NPs with potentially preventable hospitalizations from multivariable analyses and propensity score analyses. The unadjusted rates are presented, along with the ORs generated from multivariable analyses and conditional logistic regression models. Multivariable analysis indicates that patients who received care from NPs were less likely to be hospitalized for a potentially preventable condition (OR: 0.90; 95% CI, 0.87-0.93). The IPTW and 2 conditional logistic regression models, with propensity adjustment or propensity matching, produced similar results. We repeated these analyses with the longitudinal cohort, and found similar results (data not shown). The association between NP care and hospitalizations for poor diabetes control (eg, hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, etc.) in the multivariable analysis also showed similar results (OR: 0.94; 95% CI, 0.90-0.98) ( Table 2 ). Table 2 also shows the association of care by NPs with hospitalizations other than those for potentially preventable hospitalizations. Patients cared for by NPs had lower rates of other hospitalizations in the multivariable analysis (OR: 0.96; 95% CI, 0.95-0.99). The association of NP care was significantly smaller for other hospitalizations than for potentially preventable hospitalization (OR: 0.96 vs. 0.90, P = 0.001). Analyses using propensity adjustment and propensity matching showed almost identical results. Table 3 shows the results from the 2 IV analyses. The IV analysis with the proportion of receiving NP care in an HRR produced results similar to those in Table 2 [ORs for potentially preventable hospitalization of 0.91 (95% CI, 0.83-1.00) and 0.82 (95% CI, 0.74-0.89) from IV probit and 2SRI, respectively]. The IV analysis with state regulation on NP practice showed a nonsignificant decrease in odds of potentially preventable hospitalization associated with NP care (OR: 0.94; 95% CI, 0.68-1.31 and 0.86; 95% CI, 0.59-1.25). We also examined the effect of using both IVs in the same model. This model yielded results that were identical to the first IV model.\nSignificant interactions between NP care and patient comorbidity for potentially preventable hospitalizations were observed using both multivariable analyses and conditional logistic regression models. As shown in Appendix 8 (Supplemental Digital Content 8, http://links.lww.com/MLR/A1000), the association of NP care with potentially preventable hospitalizations decreased but was still significant except for <3% of patients in the highest comorbidity category. We also found significant interactions between NP care and residential area in both analyses. Patients cared for by NPs had lower rates of potentially preventable hospitalizations in nonmetropolitan urban areas (OR: 0.76; 95% CI, 0.72-0.80) and rural areas (OR: 0.75; 95% CI, 0.65-0.87). However, there was no significant difference between patients cared for by NPs versus MDs in urban areas (OR: 0.97; 95% CI, 0.94-1.01).\nIf the underlying health status differs between patients cared for by NPs versus physicians and is not completely controlled for by the measures of comorbidity and prior hospitalizations, the all-cause mortality rate might differ between the 2 groups. The 4-year mortality rate was 17.15% for patients cared for by NPs and 16.97% for those cared for by physicians [hazard ratio: 1.00 (95% CI, 0.97-1.03) adjusted for patient characteristics]. Table 4 presents the results of sensitivity analyses in which we estimated the impact of an unmeasured confounding variable. When the difference in prevalence of an unmeasured confounder between 2 groups was small (eg, 5%) and the postulated magnitude of the confounder was not large, the association of potentially preventable hospitalization associated with receipt of NP care generally remained significant. With greater difference in the prevalence or magnitude of the effect size for a potential confounder, the association of lower potentially preventable hospitalizations with NP care either disappeared or was reversed."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "We hypothesized that rates of potentially preventable hospitalization would be comparable between diabetic patients who received primary care from NPs versus physicians. The results suggesting a lower rate of potentially preventable hospitalization in patients receiving NP care were unexpected. These results may represent a valid finding of better outcomes from primary care delivered by NPs. Alternatively, they may have resulted from confounding by selection biases not completely controlled for in the analyses. We will discuss each possibility.\nRandomized controlled trials have found that NPs spend more time with patients, give patients more information, and follow-up patients more frequently than do physicians. [36] [37] [38] NPs are more likely to address psychosocial factors that affect adherence with medication 39 and are easier to access. 40 These may have contributed to the lower number of potentially preventable hospitalizations we observed.\nIn contrast, patients who seek care from physicians may have more complex or serious health problems to an extent not completely captured by administrative claims data. We assessed this, albeit indirectly, in several ways. First, adjustment for the measured confounders had only a small effect on the odds of potentially preventable hospitalization associated with NP care. Before adjustment, the OR for potentially preventable hospitalization was 0.86 (95% CI, 0.84-0.89); this changed to 0.90 (95% CI, 0.87-0.93) after adjustment. Second, the 4-year mortality rates for patients cared for by NPs and physicians did not differ, suggesting no serious differences in underlying health status. Third, we assessed hospitalizations other than those considered potentially preventable. 19 Patients cared for by NPs also had lower rates of other hospitalizations, although the decrease was significantly less than that for potentially preventable hospitalizations. The lower \"other\" hospitalization rate could be taken as evidence of residual confounding. Alternatively, some of the \"other\" hospitalizations may also be sensitive to quality of primary care.\nOur finding that the impact of NP care was stronger in nonmetropolitan areas is important. The shortage of physicians in rural areas has persisted for over 30 years. 41 Differences in access to NPs versus physicians may be greater in rural areas. Physicians in rural areas may have a larger patient burden, decreasing their ability to spend sufficient time with patients, or initially treat and follow-up with them in a time-efficient manner.\nIn the sensitivity analyses, we postulated a range of differences in prevalence and magnitude of an unmeasured confounder. To conclude that patients cared for by NPs have a higher rate of potentially preventable hospitalizations than those cared for by physicians, the difference in prevalence of an unmeasured confounder must be large (eg, 20% in the NP group vs. 40% in the physician group) with a large effect size (eg, OR: 2.5).\nAmong all of the statistical methods used, nonpooling propensity score matching resulted in the best balance in covariates between the 2 groups. However, all propensity score analyses were based on the assumption that all variables affecting the treatment assignment and outcome have been measured.\nIV analysis is a widely used method to control for unmeasured confounding in observational studies. [21] [22] [23] However, such results should be interpreted carefully. The IVs used were based on geographic differences among the 306 HRRs in the proportion of patients seeing NPs, or differences among states in regulations restricting NP practice. Geographic differences are widely used in IV analyses of outcomes. 21 The assumption in both IVs is that NP use and NP regulation are not associated with factors, such as diet or exercise, which may impact the outcome, and that are not assessed. NP use is associated with availability of primary care physicians, 3 which in turn can impact preventable hospitalizations. We controlled for physician and physician assistant supply in the IV analyses. However, the possibility of endogeneity cannot be ruled out. In addition, while our IV analyses reduced the imbalance of characteristics between the NP and physician groups, 2 covariates remained larger than 20%. Another limitation was the relatively broad CI associated with the estimate based on the state regulation IV. Finally, IV analyses estimate the treatment effect on the marginal population, patients who would receive care from NPs in states with liberal regulations but not in states with restricted regulations.\nThere are additional limitations in our study. First, we studied patients with fee-for-service Medicare coverage. The results may not be applicable to younger patients or commercially insured patients. Second, because our study focused on the period 2007 through 2010, results may not be generalizable to the current period. Third, some patients classified as receiving all their primary care from physicians may have received some care from NPs. Medicare allows physicians to submit E&M charges for a split or shared visit in which both the physician and NP treat the patient. 42 In such situations, the physician rather than the NP would normally submit the charge, because NPs have a 15% lower reimbursement rate. 43 In addition, patients may receive care from NPs who do not have their own provider identifier. Finally, we studied patients receiving all of their primary care from only NPs or only MDs, not those seeing both NPs and MDs. About 18% of diabetes patients who had at least 2 outpatient visits to primary care providers received care from both NPs and MDs compared with 0.8% who received care from NPs only. However, the proportion cared for only by NPs is growing rapidly. 3 In conclusion, using a broad range of analyses and study designs, we found no evidence that older diabetic patients who received all of their primary care from NPs had a higher risk of potentially preventable hospitalization than those who received primary care from physicians. These findings support previous research suggesting that NPs provide comparable quality of clinical care as physicians. In view of the growing role of NPs in the US health care system, information on the quality of NP care holds broad clinical and public health relevance."}]
