[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The College Course Map (CCM) is a taxonomy system for coding postsecondary education courses in NCES research studies. Originally developed in 1988 in support of the postsecondary transcript study in the National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972 (NLS-72), the taxonomy was updated 1993 for the High School and Beyond Study (HS&B) and again in 2000 for the National Educational Longitudinal Study (NELS:88/00) (Adelman, 2005). The 2010 College Course Map (CCM:2010) was updated in 2009 in support of two postsecondary education transcript collections. The 2009 Postsecondary Education Transcript Study (PETS:09) incorporated transcript collections for the 2004/09 Beginning Postsecondary Education Students Longitudinal Study (BPS:04/09) and the 2008/09 Baccalaureate and Beyond Study (B&B:08/09). This publication describes how the newest version of the College Course Map was updated and provides a listing of all the course codes used for PETS:09. CCM:2010 course codes were developed by integrating selected courses from the College Course Map (CCM) (Adelman, 2005) into the 2010 Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) taxonomy from NCES. PETS codes were represented by six digits in keeping with the CIP taxonomy: the first 2-digits indicated the most general category; the first 4-digits narrowed the focus to a subcategory; and the complete 6-digit code provided the most specific definition of the subject. Figure 1 provides a visual representation of the structure of the codes. Course codes in the CCM taxonomy, which used the same 6-digit structure as the then-current CIP, were developed through extensive transcript analysis and with input from expert advisors, including postsecondary faculty familiar with the fields of study. To create a comprehensive course coder for PETS:09, content from the CCM was merged with the 2010 CIP in two ways: (1) course codes found in the CCM without equivalents in the CIP were added as new codes, and (2) CCM codes with equivalent CIP codes were reviewed and, when additional details or examples were found, they were added to the CIP definitions. The first method resulted in the addition of 352 unique CCM course codes to the CCM:2010. These additions were placed alongside related topics in the 2-digit category and 4-digit subcategory structure common to both the CCM and CIP taxonomies. To make these additions easily identifiable, the last 2 digits in their codes used a unique numbering scheme, starting with 98 and descending as needed. An example can be seen in code 01.0698 in figure 2. The second method for integrating the CCM and the 2010 CIP resulted in adding content to the definitions of 316 CIP codes. The additional text increased the likelihood of identifying appropriate Introduction course codes using the keyword searchable coding system used in the BPS:04/09 and B&B:08/09 transcript collections. In instances where a CIP code was elaborated, the CCM content was placed at the end of the CIP definition. Finally, in addition to content from the CCM, 47 general and other codes were added to the CCM:2010 using fifth and sixth digit values of \"00\" for general and \"99\" for other, when these codes were not already present in the CIP. Figure 2 illustrates a representative set of codes in the CCM. \n"}, {"section_title": "Library Science Biological and Biomedical Sciences Mathematics and Statistics", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Code Categories", "text": "This section describes each six-digit code used to classify postsecondary education courses in the BPS:04/09 and B&B:08/09 studies. 1 01 Agriculture, Agriculture Operations, and Related Services 01.0000 Agriculture, General.
