The most commonly used growth model in fisheries is the von Bertalanffy growth model (VBGM), yet it has been shown to provide a poor fit for length-at-age data of some species and other models exist. I reviewed 196 peer-reviewed age and growth studies and 50 NOAA stock assessments to examine temporal trends in the use of growth models and model selection in fisheries. I found that the use of multi-model frameworks has increased since the year 2000 and information theoretic approaches are replacing goodness-of-fit and a priori model selection in fisheries studies. However, NOAA stock assessments rely almost exclusively on the von Bertalanffy growth model. Furthermore, factors such as the study location, and maximum age, usually did not contribute to the final model selected. I then performed a multi-model evaluation of growth models to (1) determine the bestfitting growth model for black drum (Pogonias cromis), red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus), and spotted seatrout (Cynoscion nebulosus) length-at-age data from coastal Gulf of Mexico;and (2) to evaluate the variation among state-wide and sex-specific parameter estimates. I found that sexspecific models were better fitting than pooled models, black and red drum were fit best by biphasic models, and spotted seatrout by seasonal and sigmoidal models. Texas fish were estimated to grow to larger sizes and Louisiana fish grew at a faster rate. Lastly, I modeled estuary-specific growth rates of black drum, red drum, and spotted seatrout up to age-3 and incorporated static spatial drivers as covariates into hierarchical linear models to evaluate the (1) spatial variation of growth rate among estuaries and (2) effect of static spatial drivers on the spatial variation of growth rate among estuaries. I found significant variation among estuaryspecific growth rates; furthermore, distance of marsh edge and estuary depth had a moderate ix effect in driving the variation in growth rate of female spotted seatrout and black drum, respectively. Because of sciaenid's significant importance in the Gulf of Mexico, a deep understanding of the dynamics of their growth is of critical value to fisheries managers."}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER 1. GENERAL INTRODUCTION", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Growth Modeling", "text": "Growth is the fundamental biological process of increasing in physical size (e.g. length or weight). Growth of fishes has long been of interest to fisheries managers because outside of recruitment, the increase in biomass of fish populations comes about primarily through individuals increasing in size ). Furthermore, fish growth is related to other life history metrics such as survival, reproduction Beverton 1992), natural mortality, and fecundity . Fisheries managers use growth rates along with other population dynamics rates to inform management decisions and set harvest regulations . To estimate growth, fisheries managers have traditionally used growth models, the most common growth model being the von Bertalanffy growth model (VBGM; Bertalanffy 1938). The VBGM was introduced to fisheries by  and has since received much attention, but also criticisms (Roff 1980;Day and Taylor 1997). The uncertainty surrounding the use of growth models and model parameter estimates has driven the introduction of new models, model selection procedures, and estimation methods. The use of mathematical equations and growth parameters allows managers to compare growth between populations and assess the spatial variation of fish growth. Growth of fishes varies spatially based on the biotic and abiotic conditions of an environment . Understanding the variability in growth among fish populations may aid fisheries managers in setting regulations based on observed spatial patterns which better reflect the true nature of these populations, rather than aggregating them into one large population based on some arbitrary political boundary (e.g. states). Additionally, evaluating the spatial variation of fish populations can inform managers how fish populations will respond to various management regimes, or in changing environments (e.g., ). The ubiquity and tremendous variation in the methodologies employed to model fish growth serves as an example of the importance placed on growth modeling and reducing uncertainty with regard to parameter estimates. This is especially true for commercially and recreationally harvested fish populations. As computational power has increased so has the ability to evaluate complex models and utilize methods such as Bayesian estimation . Today growth models that incorporate seasonal variation , energetic costs of reproduction , and otolith ageing-error  are being developed and evaluated to reduce uncertainty and estimate the growth of fishes more accurately.\nThe use of multi-model frameworks in peer-reviewed fisheries studies has been increasing, especially since 2000. Marine systems have more multi-model framework studies, and also tend to evaluate a wider range of models. The maximum age, system, and diet of fish species appear to be only secondary (at best) factors in determining the best-fit model. However, species biology and growth are often specific and tends toward a specific growth function; therefore, it could be that within these grouping factors a sufficient diversity of growth forms prevents the emergence of strong patterns. Location also appears to not be a factor, although my results suggest that countries with more developed management infrastructure will have more complex modeling methods; however, I realize the bias toward North American studies in my sample which arises from my limitation to studies published in English. In many cases, studies in developing regions are more concerned in providing a baseline for fisheries in some given area and the VBGM is used due to ease of fitting and comparability to other studies. However, many studies have used the VBGM without any consideration of whether or not it is the best model to describe growth of a given species. In some cases, it may be because the VBGM is relatively easy to use, yields biologically meaningful parameters, and includes parameters that can be used in comparative studies. However, this is only true if the VBGM is a good fit, otherwise these estimates will be unreliable. Therefore, I strongly suggest that unless the VBGM has previously been found to be the best fitting model for a species, multiple models should be considered. Furthermore, multi-model studies are becoming common in fisheries, which indicates that best fitting models for species are still being examined. If, in the future, we were to see the number of multi-model studies begin to decrease we may hypothesize that it is due to finding best fitting models for species rendering multi-model approaches less informative. The families Sciaenidae, Scombridae, and Carcharhinidae appear to benefit most from the use of multi-model frameworks and model selection, meaning they are more frequently found to have models besides the VBGM selected as best fit. However, this may be because they were evaluated with more models than other families, and furthermore, it is unclear whether these studies resulted in more accurate size-at-age estimates, and ultimately better management. Smart et al. 2016found that although multi-model framework studies are now common in elasmobranch studies, length-at-age estimates of 74 elasmobranch studies were only marginally affected by the approach, and the VBGM was equally likely to be best-fit as other candidate models. Furthermore, fixed-parameter models (categorized as 'other' in this study) are a common candidate model choice in chondrichthyan age and growth studies and varying degrees of support for this practice exist in the literature (Cailliet et al. 2006;Pardo et al. 2013). There have been criticisms of how well growth models capture the plasticity of growth in nature ). Because growth is variable by species and within species along gradients such as temperature, it seems logical to conclude that no one model-the VBGMcould accurately describe the growth of all fish species. However, I found it surprising that nearly half of the time the VBGM (or variation thereof) was selected as the best fitting model when multiple growth models were considered. Furthermore, despite the increase in multi-model framework studies, there was no increase with time in non-VBGM models being determined to be better fit. This study excluded larval and juvenile studies, but a major criticism of the VBGM is that it does not model the first year of growth well, and the Gompertz model has been used to model the growth of young fish . Although this study has found that the VBGM performs quite well in model selection routines, ample evidence still exists in support of multi-model approaches for modeling growth of fishes. When models are not considered, they cannot be selected , and it cannot be known if there is a better model to describe growth for a given stock or species. The seasonal VBGM tends to be selected for most among all growth models when the VBGM is not the best fitting, therefore the ability to improve growth modeling in fisheries may lie in incorporating seasonal variation in growth into commonly used growth models. The seasonal VBGM was suggested as being a strong candidate model for longlived fish ) and it has since been used to model the growth of economically important fish species such as red drum in Louisiana , sardine (Sardina pilchardus) in the Mediterranean and northeast Atlantic (Silva et al. 2008), and bonito (Sarda australis) in Australia . Not only has the seasonal VBGM been shown to perform well on a variety of fish species, it is rooted in ecological and biological theory whereby fish grow faster in warmer conditions and slower in colder conditions."}, {"section_title": "Study Species", "text": "Sciaenids, specifically black drum (Pogonias cromis), red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus), and spotted seatrout (Cynoscion nebulosus) inhabit estuaries for all or part of their lives (i.e., estuarine-dependent).

Because of this recreational and commercial importance, the growth of these sciaenids has been studied heavily.

I then conduct a multi-model evaluation of growth models to three recreationally and culturally important species in the Gulf of Mexico to determine whether the most commonly used growth model (VBGM) is in fact the best fit for sciaenids and whether that fit varies based on sex and location. Lastly, I fit estuarine-specific models to length-at-age data of sub-adult fishes and incorporate environmental covariates into Bayesian hierarchical models to evaluate whether or not abiotic static spatial drivers of estuaries (e.g. estuary drainage area) contribute to the growth of sciaenids in the Gulf of Mexico. Overall, this study is an in-depth look at the growth of sciaenids in the Gulf of Mexico, including how growth rate and model fit varies spatially across the Gulf of Mexico, and what drivers contribute to that spatial variation of growth.

"}, {"section_title": "References", "text": "\nAkaike    was the first to describe the age and growth of sciaenids in Texas and since then they have been the subject of many age and growth studies (see Appendix A). Additionally, because of heavy exploitation in the commercial and recreational fisheries, many sciaenid species have a long history of regulation and management. In the GoM, red drum was one of the first species to be designated as overfished, a designation that occurred in 1987. Since that designation, the harvest of red drum in federal waters of the GoM has been prohibited and the majority of red drum landings take place in state waters by the recreational sector (Murphy and Crabtree 2001). Of the three species considered here, black drum receives the least targeted recreational fishing pressure; however, black drum harvest (commercial and recreational) did increase in the mid-1980s as a response to the red drum harvest reductions ). Black drum currently supports important commercial fisheries in the GoM, with the majority of commercial landings occurring in  . Black and red drum are unique species in that they grow and mature quickly (usually within 2-6 years) and are long-lived Jones and Wells 1998). Of the three species considered in this study, spotted seatrout are the shortest lived, with an estimated maximum age of 18 years (Froese et al. 2017). Spotted seatrout live their entire lives within their natal estuaries and adjacent coast lines, and do not travel far in their lifetime . Spotted seatrout mature by the first summer after hatching and females are known to grow faster and be larger-at-age than males . Despite the VBGM being the most widely used growth model in fisheries, previous studies have shown that the VBGM is a poor fit for red drum  and spotted seatrout (Murphy and Taylor 1994;) lengthat-age data as well as other sciaenids (Gulf corvina Cynoscion othonopterus; Aragon-Noriega 2014). Although previous black drum length-at-age studies have not extensively evaluated multiple growth models for fit, no growth model has been shown to be a better-fit for black drum than the traditional VBGM. Because black and red drum are similar in their life history-which includes a distinct juvenile phase in estuaries and a distinct adult phase offshore-a seasonal or biphasic variation of the VBGM may be appropriate to model length-at-age of black drum, as has been shown with red drum. Spotted seatrout length-at-age data are often fit best by sigmoidal or linear models, and of the three species considered here, spotted seatrout has perhaps the most variable growth across the GoM. For example, the logistic model was found to be better fitting than the two parameter VBGM, three parameter VBGM, and Gompertz model in Mississippi ), a linear model was used to model growth in Barataria Bay, Louisiana , and sex-specific growth models were best-fitting in Florida, in which females were best modeled by the Gompertz model, and males by linear regression from a suite of candidate models including the Schnute model , generalized VBGM, Gompertz, VBGM, and linear regression (Murphy and Taylor 1994). Because spotted seatrout are limited in their lifetime movements and are comprised of many different stocks across GoM estuaries Baker and Matlock 1993), the trajectory of growth and best-fitting growth model may differ even between nearby estuaries (Bortone 2003). At least 15 or more commonly used growth models (and countless parameterizations) can be found in the literature (see Chapter 2), necessitating a need for some type of model selection criteria when evaluating multiple growth models. To aid in choosing the best-fit growth model, model selection using Information Theoretic Criterion has emerged as one way to choose the best-fitting model and today is the dominant practice in fisheries science (see Chapter 2). Growth modeling is an integral part of stock management and errors in growth estimates can cause problems when included in stock assessments and other models. Therefore, multiple models should be evaluated for fit, rather than relying on one model (e.g. the traditional VBGM). Age and growth studies that use multiple models and model selection make robust parameter estimates and reduce the uncertainty surrounding the estimates of growth models ; . Due to the significant economic, recreational, and cultural importance of sciaenids in the GoM, reducing the uncertainty surrounding the use of growth models and resulting estimates of growth is of critical value to fisheries managers. The objectives of this study are: (1) to determine the best-fitting growth model(s) for black drum, red drum, and spotted seatrout length-at-age data from the western GoM (Louisiana and Texas); and (2) to evaluate the spatial and sex-specific variation among growth parameter estimates."}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER 2. TRENDS IN GROWTH MODELING IN FISHERIES", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Growth-the change in organism size with age-is a basic yet critically important biological process that integrates numerous processes and shapes the life history of fishes. Growth can be directly linked to other life history traits such as natural mortality and fecundity . The ability to model fish growth accurately has a wide range of applications in population dynamics (Smart et al. 2016). Outside of recruitment, increases in the biomass of a (closed) stock come about by the growth of individuals. For population analyses (e.g., stock assessments), mathematical models relating the size (typically length) of a fish species to its age are necessary inputs to other models. Growth models estimate parameters that are inputs into larger stock assessment models, which are used to inform management decisions. Growth curves are also used to select length limits for harvest and make other regulatory and management decisions. Furthermore, growth data can be used to assess the status of a fishery and determine how fisheries have responded or will respond to exploitation (Zhu et al. 2009). For example, growth parameter estimates can be used to compare different populations (or stocks) over time as a tool to evaluate density-dependence or prey-availability (Lauerburg et al. 2018;Matthias et al. 2018). Growth of fishes often varies by species and within species along gradients (e.g., latitude, temperature), and the use of mathematical models to represent growth allows for comparison (DeVries and Grimes 1997; . Growth modeling is typically achieved by relating the size of a species (e.g., length or weight) to its age. Traditionally in fisheries science, it was common to fit one growth model to size-at-age data. However, many model types have been proposed and evaluated to estimate the growth of fishes. Most are asymptotic, sigmoidal, or biphasic (having two growth phases) in shape, but other model types such as linear  and polynomial functions (Chen et al. 1992) have also been used to describe growth of some species (Figure 2.1). von Bertalanffy (1938) derived his well-known growth equation that balances the catabolic and anabolic processes of growth, to relate organism size based on its age.  modified and introduced the von Bertalanffy growth model (VBGM) to fisheries Figure 2.1. Four common growth functions used to model fish growth. The von Bertalanffy growth function (upper left), logistic growth function (upper right), Lester biphasic growth function (lower left) and power growth function (lower right) are shown to illustrate the differences among models. Data (black dots) were simulated from the same model parameterization that fit the individual growth functions (red lines). The shaded background areas correspond to parameter interpretations, although please reference specific growth equations for details. and it has received much attention and use in the following decades. Prior to the introduction of the VBGM, growth parameters were not estimated in size-at-age studies; instead observed (or mean) size-at-age data were plotted to visualize the trajectory of growth and make inferences. However, size-at-age studies were very inaccurate prior to otolith aging; for example,  estimated the maximum age of red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus) to be between 3 -6 years, yet we now know it to be around 50 years . Since 1957, the VBGM has been the most widely used growth model in fisheries. However, other commonly used growth models now include the Gompertz growth model (Gompertz 1825), the logistic model , the generalized VBGM (Pauly 1979), and the Schnute-Richards model (Schnute and Richards 1990), to name a few. The uncertainty around how well growth models predict growth has driven the introduction of new methods, models, and model selection procedures. Today, it is common for fisheries researchers to fit multiple growth models to size-at-age data and use information theoretic (IT) procedures to select the best fitting model. Model selection using IT is a relatively new practice in biological sciences that has emerged as one way to account for the uncertainty surrounding the a priori use of growth models . The most widely used IT for model selection is Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC;. Other IT criteria such as Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC; Schwarz 1978), small-sample bias-corrected form of AIC (AICc; Shono 2000), and Akaike weight (Burnham and Anderson 2002; have also been used in fisheries studies to select best fitting growth models. I reviewed the peer-reviewed literature to examine how the use of growth models and model selection has changed over time, and whether any trends can be determined in the approach to growth modeling. I also examined how the approach to growth modeling is influenced by various factors (e.g., marine vs. fresh, developed vs. undeveloped countries, maximum age of species). I also considered (i) whether certain models have been used more frequently or have been shown to be better fitting for certain species or families, and (ii) how the approach to growth modeling changes as a function of a species maximum age, system (e.g., marine or freshwater), or diet. Additionally, I reviewed recent stock assessments from NOAA regional fisheries management councils (FMC) to analyze whether or not the trends in growth modeling in the peer-reviewed literature is reflected in stock assessments.\nGrowth is a basic life history trait and the product of many physiological, biological, and environmental processes. Fish growth rates (e.g., the increase in length with age) are used in the management of fisheries populations Methot and Wetzel 2013) because individual growth is a major source of gains to biomass of populations, and growth is related to other life history variables such as survival and reproduction Beverton 1992). However, fish growth rates vary between species and within species. Spatial variation of growth among fish populations has been a focus of fisheries research for some time Wagner et al. 2007;. This is because the growth of fish may vary even between nearby waterbodies and be regulated under the same management regime, which could lead to poor management of fisheries stocks. Additionally, understanding the spatial variation of fish populations can inform managers how populations will react to different management actions, or during shifting environmental conditions . Therefore, understanding the spatial variability in fish populations dynamics is an important component of fisheries ecology, conservation, and management, especially for species that are heavily harvested, both recreationally and commercially. Spatial variation of fish growth may arise due to a wide range of factors. Previous research into drivers of spatial variation of fish growth has focused on genetics (Chandrapavan et al. 2010;, habitat Stunz et al. 2002a), and environmental factors (Wagner et al. 2007;Forrester 2003;Morriengiello 2014). More recently, attention has been given to cross-scale interactions  and macrosystems ecology  to evaluate drivers of ecological processes on different spatial scales that interact and influence local response variables. New methodologies (e.g., Bayesian estimation) made possible by an increase in computational power have emerged as a way to examine macrosystems and cross-scale interactions (Levy et al. 2014). This is an emerging field in fisheries that has shown promise identifying broad-scale drivers of ecological processes such as local and regional land-use driving lake phosphorus ). Because so many confounding abiotic and biotic factors exist that could potentially affect fish growth, relating spatial variation of growth to environmental characteristics requires that individuals have been separated from one another in areas that differ in some way environmentally. For this reason, lakes (closed, inland systems that function as ecological islands) offer a nice framework for evaluating spatial differences between populations and the majority of previous research has focused on relating landscape and environmental characteristics to life history traits such as growth and reproductive success in freshwater lake environments (Wagner et al. 2007;. Although not completely separate from one another, estuaries offer a similar framework of fish subpopulations.  found spatial variation of flounder growth and concluded that environmental conditions within estuaries was likely driving the observed variation of growth rates. Estuaries are unique and dynamic environments  and their importance as nursery habitat and to fisheries production is well-documented, yet they are among the most modified and threatened aquatic environments (Blaber et al. 2000;Able 2005;Amara et al. 2009). The physical, chemical, anthropogenic, and hydrologic characteristics of estuaries influence habitat conditions and even forage, which may result in indirect effects on the growth rates of fish inhabiting these estuaries. Black drum (Pogonias cromis), red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus), and spotted seatrout (Cynoscion nebulosus) are economically and recreationally important estuarine-dependent species that are found throughout the Gulf of Mexico (GoM). Black drum and red drum inhabit estuaries as juveniles and leave upon maturation, usually between age 3-6 to join the adult offshore population . These fish return to estuaries in the spring (black drum) and fall (red drum) to spawn. Tagging studies have shown that black drum exhibit little inter-bay movement (Osburn and Matlock 1984) and spotted seatrout will typically live within a single estuary and adjacent coast lines for their entire lives . Because these species inhabit estuaries for all or part of their lives, their growth rate may be related to environmental characteristics within those estuaries. Because many environmental conditions within estuaries (e.g., salinity, temperature, dissolved oxygen) vary temporally, I was interested in variables that I hypothesized to remain static within the relevant timescale (e.g., estuary drainage area, latitude, etc.). Henceforth, I will refer to these types of factors (temporally invariant abiotic variables) as static spatial drivers. My objectives are (1) to evaluate the variation of sciaenid growth rate among GoM estuaries, and 2to identify static spatial drivers of estuaries that have an effect on the growth rate of sciaenids by directly incorporating hypothesized drivers into growth models. I considered static spatial drivers for inclusion into my model based on the hypothesized relationships (and previous evidence of effect) of those drivers on fish growth rate."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "\n\n"}, {"section_title": "Peer-Reviewed Literature", "text": "I used Web of Science to conduct two peer-reviewed literature searches. First, I used the search terms, Title: 'growth' AND Topic: 'models' AND Topic: 'fish' NOT Publication Name: 'aquaculture'. For the second search I used, Topic: 'growth' AND Topic: 'models' AND Topic: 'fish' NOT Publication Name: 'aquaculture'. The results of both searches were refined by Web of Science Categories 'fisheries'. The first search was conducted on October 17, 2016, and produced 769 results. The second search was conducted on January 25, 2017, and produced 2,666 results. In my first search, 'growth' was included in the title, whereas in my second search, 'growth' was included as the topic. This change in the search terms resulted in a larger sample size, after the first search produced what I thought to be a low sample size. To evaluate trends in the use of growth models, model fit, and model selection, a dataset was compiled from the individual studies of my search. I chose to only include studies that were estimating growth of a group (e.g., stock or population) of wild fishes using length-at-age data. Therefore, mark-recapture, aquaculture, larval, and juvenile growth studies were excluded. From the studies matching my criteria, I recorded information for the lead author, year of publication, species name, species family, location of the study population, the number and type of candidate growth models evaluated in the study, the best fit model, the model selection process used, what estimation process was used (if reported; e.g., least squares, maximum likelihood, Bayesian), whether or not the model took into account effects on growth (defined by the addition of model parameters), and whether or not separate growth models were ultimately fit for males and females. From FishBase (Froese et al. 2017) I also collected any available diet (e.g., benthivorous, piscivorous), system (freshwater or marine), and maximum age information for species from each study. While collecting these data, I had 16 categories for models; 2-parameter VBGM, 3-parameter VBGM, 2-parameter Gompertz, 3-parameter Gompertz, 2-parameter logistic, 3-parameter logistic, Schnute, Richards, Schnute-Richards, double VBGM, generalized VBGM, linear VBGM, seasonal VBGM, power, linear regression, and other (Table 2.1). Some models that were evaluated by individual studies were obscure, having low usage in the literature and, therefore, could not be placed into one of my discrete categories, thus I classified these models as other. Most of these models were fixed-parameter, specialized, or modified variations of more that more broadly grouped the models into one of six groups, either the Gompertz, logistic, VBGM, double VBGM, seasonal VBGM, or Richards-Schnute. These aggregated groups included 2-parameter, 3-parameter, seasonal, and other variations of the five parent model types. The seasonal and double VBGM were kept separate from the VBGM group because they each had high selection as best-fit (50 and 75% of the time evaluated, respectively) relative to other variations of traditional models (Table 2.2). I also aggregated model selection (model select 2) such that only IT (Information theoretic), GOF (goodness-of-fit), and a priori were considered as model selection types. Information theoretic consisted of AIC, AICc, Akaike weight, BIC, and DIC. Goodness-of-fit consisted of R 2 , log-likelihood, residual sum of squares, GOF, mean squared error, likelihood ratio tests, and principal components analysis, while a priori consisted of those studies that only evaluated and used one growth model in their respective study. Lastly, I grouped locations broadly by continent. These data were divided into two classes based on the number of models evaluated: (i) those studies that only used one growth model (a priori) and (ii) those that evaluated multiple models. I further divided those studies that evaluated multiple growth models, based on what model was found to be best fit: (i) those that found the VBGM (or variation of VBGM) to be best-fit and (ii) those that found a model other than the VBGM to be best-fit. I summarized the data and analyzed spatial and temporal trends in the use of growth models and model selection criterion in the peer-reviewed literature. I also consider whether the evaluation of multiple growth models and model selection has been especially beneficial in finding better fitting growth models for certain families (or species), and how the approach to growth modeling changes as a function of a species maximum age, system (marine or fresh), or diet, by subsetting and summarizing the data.  20103-parameter Gompertz !

Aside from one outlier in 1992 (one study that evaluated 6 growth models), the annual average inclusion of growth models increased from about 1 throughout the 1990s to 2.45 in 2016. Despite this increase in multi-model frameworks, only 42% of studies considered more than one candidate growth model (Figure 2.3). The largest number of models evaluated by one study was 7, and the mean number of models evaluated among all studies was 2 (median = 1). Among all peer-reviewed studies, the most common models to be considered as candidate models were the 3-parameter VBGM (95% of studies), followed by the 3-parameter Gompertz model (21%), and the 3-parameter logistic model (16%).

Of the 3 spotted seatrout multi-model framework studies, 2 studies found that the VBGM was not the best fit model; this was the highest number of studies to find models other than the VBGM to be best fit for any one species. One spotted seatrout study found the Gompertz and linear regression to best fit females and males, respectively, and another study found the logistic growth model to be the best fit. The families demonstrating non-VBGM selected as best fit are Sciaenidae (n=5), Carcharhinidae (n=2), and Scombridae (n=2). Of the studies that found a model other than the VBGM (or variation) to be best fitting, 89% were in marine systems."}, {"section_title": "Model Selection", "text": "Among all peer-reviewed studies, 55% chose growth models a priori. The 3-parameter VBGM (or variation) was used a priori in 103 of 106 studies compared to one time each for linear regression, the seasonal VBGM, and a sinusoidal Schnute model. The family with the most a priori use of growth models was Scombridae (n=10); however, the a priori use of growth models was also common for studies modeling the growth of multiple species (or families). In freshwater systems, 72% of studies used growth models a priori, compared to just under 50% in marine environments. Of those studies using a priori model selection, 42% did not report their estimation method. Among peer-reviewed studies, 11% used GOF to select the best model. The most common GOF method was R 2 , followed by log-likelihood. The use of GOF has decreased over time, especially after 2008 ( Figure 2.5). The a priori use of growth models and GOF for model selection were common throughout the 1990s, but since then GOF methods of model selection have seen a sharp decline. Some form of IT criteria was used for model selection by 28% of studies. AIC was the most common IT criteria for model selection, followed by AICc. The first uses of IT criteria in my dataset occurred in 2002 (Imai et al. 2002;. After that point, a marked increase in use of IT criteria is apparent (Figure 2 \nBetween 1988 and 2016, IT criteria emerged as the most common process by which to select growth models. Similar to the use of multi-model frameworks, the use of IT criteria increased beginning around 2000-corresponding to the publishing of Burnham and Anderson (1998)-which advocated and popularized methods for the use of this IT approach. The use of IT criteria in fisheries also follows the general trend of other ecological fields (Guthery et al. 2005;Symonds and Moussalli 2011). With the increase in IT approaches, the most rapid decline was seen in GOF methods. This is likely due to advances in statistical programming packages that made it relatively easy to obtain AIC values for model comparison. Statistical model selection in fisheries appears to have two dominant paradigms, GOF and IT. Despite this recent movement toward the use of IT criteria, there have been criticisms that the IT approach only amounts to a substitution of one statistical ritual for another and that ecology, not statistics should be at the forefront of all ecological studies (Guthery et al. 2005). Furthermore, the IT approach (specifically AIC) has been criticized because it considers model parsimony, such that models with fewer parameters will be preferentially selected (Pardo et al. 2013). However, others have argued for AIC biases in the opposite direction-such that more complex models (i.e., models with more parameters) are too often selected (see Ye et al. 2008). Zhu et al. (2009) compared six model selection approaches of fish growth models and found that AICc and BIC performed best for small and large data sets, respectively. Brewer et al. (2016) also found AICc and BIC to be the best model selection methods when unobserved heterogeneity was small and large, respectively, and suggested the use of multiple model selection methods."}, {"section_title": "Stock Assessments", "text": "I also reviewed a total of 50 stock assessments that were the most up-to-date for each species. The results of this search were less variable than my search of peer-reviewed studies, with only three stock assessments using a model other than the traditional 3-parameter VBGM. The Pacific FMC used a Schnute parameterized version of the VBGM to model the growth of three species: kelp greenling (Hexagrammos decagrammus), blue rockfish (Sebastes mystinus), and starry flounder (Platichthys stellatus), although it was not explicitly stated why that model was used. The most assessed family was Pleuronectidae (n=10, or 20% of total stock assessments). The regional FMC with the most stock assessments was by far the Pacific (n=20, or 40% of total stock assessments), followed by the North Pacific (n=10, or 20% of total stock assessments). Sexes were separated for growth modeling in 66% of stock assessments I reviewed. Model selection was never mentioned in any of the stock assessments, thus all were assumed to be selected a priori.\nEven though many growth models are available, it is rare for stock assessments to test multiple candidate models . This may be due in part to the software that is used to perform stock assessments. However, I found it surprising that NOAA regional FMC tended to use the VBGM almost exclusively a priori in stock assessments. Furthermore, the only noticeable similarity between peer-reviewed studies and stock assessments regarding their approach to growth modeling, are that they both seem to separate sexes for growth modeling at a similar proportion (58% of peer-reviewed studies compared to 66% of stock assessments). Because growth can be stock-specific (widely distributed species' life histories may vary), it seems unreasonable to expect that one growth model could accurately describe growth for all stocks. There may be unintended consequences if growth parameters are being estimated using the VBGM a priori and used to inform management decisions if there are better models to describe growth of a given species. I found three stock assessments for species that have peerreviewed studies which showed a model other than the traditional VBGM to be best fit, gag "}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "\nIn short, the results of my growth analysis determined that more than one growth model may be best-fit when fitted to sciaenid length-at-age data throughout the western GoM and the traditional VBGM may not be the best-fit.

Texas fish were estimated to be larger than Louisiana fish, while Louisiana fish grew at a faster rate."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "In studying historic and recent trends to fish growth modeling it was apparent that while some approaches remained constant over time (a priori use of VBGM), there is still a large amount of variability in how fisheries scientists evaluate growth. The current state of growth modeling in fisheries is dynamic, and is increasingly becoming more complex and statistically demanding as models are created that account for variability in growth due to a variety of factors (environment, maturity, etc.; Kimura 2008;. It is likely that the next phase of fish growth modeling will move past multi-model approaches and focus on making the species-specific, best-fitting models more advanced. For example, hierarchical Bayesian models have recently appeared in the literature and have made advancements in growth comparisons , changes in growth over time (He and Bence 2007), and accounting for spatial variability . Measurement-error models also show promise as a way to explicitly include observer (aging) error into growth models . Despite these statistical advances on the horizon, relatively little advancement has been made to incorporate growth models other than the VBGM into stock assessment models. Despite an increase in attempts to find better fitting models, the VBGM is often chosen as best fit and thus, this lack of advancement may be inconsequential to stock status. Additionally, from the perspective of long-term assessment, the benefit of the consistency of one model (VBGM) over time may outweigh the cost of not using the best fitting model for a shorter time. More accurate estimates of growth improve management and protection of stocks for the future, and thus, we should always be evaluating new models, regardless of whether or not these new models will ultimately be used in stock assessments and the decision-making process of fisheries managers.\nThe use of the traditional VBGM may result in poor estimates of sciaenid growth in the GoM. Future studies should consider a framework similar to this when performing length-at-age analyses. I found the use of multiple models to be much more informative than if I had chosen a single growth model. Furthermore, I believe that evaluating multiple growth models can aid fisheries managers by reducing uncertainty and allowing them to estimate growth more confidently. Future studies should consider spatial and sex-specific variation and compare the VBGM to alternative growth models when estimating fish growth. By evaluating multiple growth models and considering the spatial and sex-specific variation of growth among populations, fisheries managers will perform robust analyses and thereby reduce uncertainty when setting fisheries regulations, resulting in better management of fish populations."}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "In order to evaluate the variation in goodness-of-fit of growth models among sciaenids across the western GoM, I used data collected from fisheries-independent sampling programs led by the At the time of capture, all fish were measured to total length (TL in mm) or fork length (FL in mm) and sexed by macroscopic examination of gonads. Otoliths were extracted and processed, and ages were estimated (for full details see GSMFC, 2009 Although most lengths were recorded as total length (TL), some were recorded as fork length (FL). Regulations for these three species are set in TL; therefore, I converted FL to TL with the following equations. Spotted Seatrout: TL (in.) = 1.0008 * FL (in.) + 0.6306 (Joe West, LDWF, personal comm.) Black Drum: TL (mm) = 1.03 * FL (mm) -3.8  Red Drum: TL (in.) = 1.092 * FL (in.) -1.01 (Goodyear 1996) Furthermore, from my data, outliers that exceeded three times the standard deviation of the mean length-at-age (biological age and whole age when biological age was not available) were excluded. Removal of these data excluded observations that seemed biologically unreasonable; i.e., fish that appeared too large or too small for their age class. Because otolith aging is not always 100% accurate, it is not unreasonable to assume that some aging error has occurred. Thus, by removing these extreme data points we can be more confident in the aging process that has generated these data. Although borrowing data from another region is not ideal, it can be justified because these fish all come from the same GoM stock (Jones and Wells 1998;Seyoum et al. 2000). In other words, older black and red drum are known to move throughout the GoM (Gold and Turner 2002), which may be obscuring local influences on maximum average size. Little is known about the adult black and red drum stocks and this is especially true in regard to natal homing; however, adult red drum are thought to be highly mobile because tagged fish have been recaptured more than 700 km from their original tagging location . Thus, to improve the contrast in the data, I included old, large black and red drum from Louisiana in the Texas data. The addition of Louisiana black drum female data accounted for 10% of the total data used to estimate growth of Texas black drum females, while the addition of Louisiana black drum male data accounted for 6% of the total data used to estimate growth of Texas black drum males. The addition of Louisiana red drum female data accounted for 2% of the total data used to estimate growth of Texas red drum females and the addition of Louisiana red drum male data also accounted for 2% of the total data used to estimate growth of Texas red drum males. In recognition of the fact that old, large fish can influence the fit of a model, the proportion of borrowed sample was limited to \u2264 10% for any given data set."}, {"section_title": "Models and model justification", "text": "All growth models were fitted to observed length-at-age data in R (R Core Team 2016) using the nls function, which estimates parameters by least squares. Dimorphic growth between sexes of each species and state was assessed by comparing the pooled sex AIC score with the sum of the sex-specific AIC scores. Additionally, model parameters were evaluated by comparing the L\u221e parameter estimates and 95% confidence intervals (\u00b11.96 x standard error) for the best-fit models. Candidate growth models and the parameter explanations are given in Table 3.1. The VBGM , Gompertz , and logistic (Ricker 1979) models were fit to all three species because they represent the three most commonly used growth models in fisheries (see Chapter 2). Thus, they estimate parameters that are the most comparable with previous studies. Generally, the VBGM represents growth as asymptotic, while the Gompertz and logistic models represent growth as sigmoidal. For black and red drum the double VBGM  was fit to observed length-at-age data. Unlike the VBGM which estimates a single growth rate parameter (k), the double VBGM allows the rate at which an organism approaches the asymptotic length to change after some pivotal age, tp. The double VBGM accommodates the possibility that older, larger fish might grow more slowly in proportion to their length than younger, smaller fish .

(#) = : k4, k5 = instantaneous growth rate coefficients tp = 'pivotal age' t2, t3 = age intercept parameters to provide a better fit to length-at-age data for this species. To accommodate the possibility that fish grow at different rates seasonally, a seasonal VBGM equation Haddon 2001; was evaluated for all three species.  developed a seasonal growth model similar to the VBGM that, according to AIC, fit red drum length-at-age data better than the traditional VBGM and suggested it may be appropriate to describe growth for species that change habitat preference with age or are subject to strong seasonal environmental fluctuations. Because black drum are similar in their life history and habitat preference to red drum (they live as juveniles in estuaries before maturing and moving offshore to join the adult population), a seasonal VBGM may also be appropriate and improve model fit. Likewise, spotted seatrout generally live their entire lives within estuaries and adjacent coast lines ; thus, they are likely to exhibit seasonal variation in growth due to changing environmental conditions within estuaries. Additionally, considering spotted seatrout are shorter-lived than black or red drum, a given year or season may be more influential than for a long-lived species like black and red drum. Lastly, I evaluated the power model  for fit with spotted seatrout length-at-age data. This model was chosen because a wide range of models have been shown to be of good fit for spotted seatrout (see Appendix A), and the power model is a flexible growth model that can accommodate both linear and non-linear growth trajectories. Considering that spotted seatrout growth has been represented previously with both linear and non-linear models, the power model is a good candidate model. To the best of my knowledge, the power model has not been evaluated by any spotted seatrout age and growth study to date. However, power models have been shown to be a good fit for juvenile black drum , as well as other sciaenids, such as Spotfin Croaker Roncador stearnsii (Williams et al. 2012).\nI sought a model for each species that best captured the shape of growth over the ages in which the estuary environment is hypothesized to play a role. I fit hierarchical linear models to observed length-at-age data. A linear model was used for three reasons; (1) the visual fit of linear models to the data, (2) the parsimony of comparison and interpretability of the linear model parameters, and (3) the known extremely rapid and linear growth of black drum, red drum, and spotted seatrout at young ages . Spotted seatrout growth was fitted with sex-specific models because they are known to mature quickly and exhibit sexually dimorphic growth Chapter 3). Furthermore, Callihan et al. (2013) found that females have higher rates of fidelity to estuarine environments which makes them more vulnerable to estuarine-specific drivers. Model equations are given below."}, {"section_title": "Model selection", "text": "Two methods of model selection were used to select the best-fitting model. The first method is to choose one single best-fitting model based on AIC. Models that have the lowest AIC values are considered to be the best-fit to the data. Models that have a score difference (\u2206 AIC) of \u2206 > 10 have virtually no support and can be removed from further consideration (Burnham and Anderson 2002). Models with \u2206 < 2 have substantial support, and those models with 4 < \u2206 < 7 have marginal support (Burnham and Anderson 2002). \nThe best-fit models for each species and state combination had 100% Akaike weight. The traditional VBGM and Gompertz model were never selected as best-fit for any species, or for a sex of a species; all other candidate models were chosen at least once as the best-fitting model. From the four state-sex combinations for which growth models were fit for black drum, the double VBGM was always selected as the best-fit. Similarly, for red drum the double VBGM was always selected as the best-fit. For spotted seatrout, the seasonal VBGM was selected the most (n=2), followed by the logistic model (n=1), and the power model (n=1). The VBGM always estimated an asymptotic size larger than the Gompertz model, and the Gompertz always estimated a larger asymptotic length than the logistic model.\nI found that all of the best-fit models gained 100% Akaike weight, and thus model-averaging was not possible for any species-sex set of candidate models. For this reason, and that modelaveraging can only average the L\u221e parameter (because the k parameter is not directly comparable between growth models) I feel it may be of little utility. For example, in the case of my spotted seatrout analysis, the power model cannot be model averaged and thus, if it was given any Akaike weight, it would be ignored and could not be model averaged. While MMI and modelaveraging has shown to be a useful tool in making robust parameter estimates and reducing uncertainty , I found it to provide no additional insight. Model-averaging may be more useful when working with small data sets, or when growth is highly variable between individuals of a population. Despite my disappointment with model-averaging, I found the use of Akaike weights to be an easily interpretable measure of uncertainty regarding model selection. The variation among model selection techniques and appropriate usage of each, is an interesting topic that is substantially debated in ecology (Brewer et al. 2016;Galipaud et al. 2017).

The double VBGM performed best for Texas and Louisiana black drum males and females. The traditional VBGM outperformed the seasonal VBGM except for Louisiana females. The worst-fit model for all state-sex combinations of black drum was the logistic model, which likely could be dropped from further black drum growth analysis.

Females attained a larger asymptotic size and also grew at a faster rate than males. Females reached 47% of L\u221e at age-2 and 79% of L\u221e at age-6. Males were modeled best by the power model, which does not estimate an asymptotic length parameter.

I found that Louisiana and Texas red drum females were estimated to grow to a larger asymptotic size than males. The larger asymptotic length estimates for red drum females I found are supported by previous studies (Beckman et al. 1989;. However, the majority of studies of red drum length-at-age reported parameter estimates for combined sexes and I found that sex-specific models were better fitting. Thus, sexspecific growth modeling for red drum may be appropriate for future analyses. Sex-specific estimates of growth have been reported for red drum (Beckman et al. 1989;; however, these studies estimated the growth of the offshore adult red drum population, while this study modeled the growth of fish caught from inshore and near coast environments.  found no difference in growth of age 1-3 female and male red drum in coastal Florida.

This linear growth trajectory of males has been observed here and elsewhere (Murphy and Taylor 1994;, and suggests that the concept of asymptotic growth may not apply to spotted seatrout males. Furthermore, the next best-fit model was the Gompertz model and it too had wide confidence intervals and showed no difference between sexes. Because my data included fish up to age-10 and the maximum age of spotted seatrout has been estimated at 18 years (Froese et al. 2017) it is possible that I did not observe enough old fish to capture the asymptote of the models. Nonetheless, spotted seatrout are heavily targeted and harvested in the recreational fishery and so it may be unlikely to observe a fish approaching maximum age or size. Therefore, it may be more important to best estimate the growth of younger fish and worry less about the estimation of a maximum size because these fish are unlikely to reach this length. The spotted seatrout growth analysis revealed that the seasonal VBGM was best-fit for Louisiana male and females and the logistic and power models were best-fit for Texas females and males, respectively. Interestingly, the power model was ranked last for all spotted seatrout state-sex combinations, except for Texas male spotted seatrout where it was found to be best-fit. My results are similar to previous studies that have found linear models , and sigmoidal models (logistic and Gompertz) described the growth of spotted seatrout best (Murphy and Taylor 1994;. \nThe estuary-specific linear growth fits show variability of growth rate for spotted seatrout females among GoM estuaries (see again Figure 4.2). Estimated growth rates ranged from about 58-92 mm/yr. (see again Table 4.2). The smallest slope for female spotted seatrout was estimated for Charlotte Harbor, and the greatest was estimated for Calcasieu. Calcasieu was the only estuary to have an estimated growth rate that was significantly different from the population mean growth rate and was also significantly different from most other estuaries (Figure 4.7).

"}, {"section_title": "Biphasic growth", "text": "The concept of a change in an individual's growth rate is rooted in biological and life history theory, whereby at some stage or age fish reduce the amount of somatic growth to increase their reproductive growth. This phenomenon is accompanied by a change in habitat for black and red drum, which mature and leave estuarine habitats between ages 2-6 . Given this life history, the double VBGM, which allows growth to change at a given age, seems like a biologically reasonable growth model. The double VBGM has been shown to be a good fit for many species including striped trumpeter Latris lineata (Tracey and Lyle 2005), spiny dogfish Squalus acanthias , and Atlantic sturgeon Acipenser oxyrinchus (Balazik et al. 2012) as well as red drum .  developed a seasonal growth model which outperformed the double VBGM, although my parameterization of seasonal VBGM (Haddon 2001) did not. However, one major downfall of the seasonal VBGM, is the failure to converge when whole age data are used (as opposed to biological age), and thus, the seasonal VBGM did not converge for the Texas red drum analysis. In most cases, for black and red drum the traditional VBGM was a better fit than the Gompertz and logistic models, which were always ranked as the last two models based on AIC.  found similar results regarding the poor fit of the Gompertz and logistic models with red drum. However, early life growth of black and red drum may be described well by the Gompertz or logistic models, and this has been documented as being a good fit for younger, faster growing fishes ). Furthermore,  found that juvenile black drum data were best-fit by a power model. While I found the double VBGM to be a better fit to length-at-age data of black and red drum, future studies should consider biphasic models with a power or logistic function to model the growth of juvenile fish. At least 25 biphasic growth models have been proposed for use in fisheries age and growth studies (Wilson et al. 2018). These models can have a discontinuous (or discrete) change in growth with age, where the growth rate changes at some pivotal age, or continuous change in growth which allows a fish to smoothly change between growth phases throughout their life . Biphasic models have been used to describe the change in growth rate as a function of maturity, habitat shift, and diet shift (Wilson et al. 2018). Because my estimated pivotal age of black and red drum coincided with the estimated age-at-maturity, I believe it may be investment in reproductive output that is the driving force for this change in growth rate among black and red drum, and not the habitat shift from estuaries to offshore (although they may be confounded). Additionally, ontogenetic shifts to adult prey items in black and red drum occur very early in their life history (Peters and McMichael Jr. 1987) and thus, shifts in diet are unlikely to be a driving force for a change in growth at the pivotal ages I estimated.  , for long-lived species such as black and red drum, this growth variation is likely to be dampened later in life, especially because these fish leave estuaries and enter the GoM. Thus, at older ages I believe that growth between the two states is similar, and that some fish caught in Louisiana at older ages could very well have been spawned within Texas estuaries. This is supported by tagging studies that show large neighborhood areas of 700-900 km (Gold and Turner 2002). However, complete sampling of the life history in Texas drums would increase the ability for researchers to evaluate and compare growth between Louisiana and Texas."}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER 4. SPATIAL VARIATION AND DRIVERS OF SCIAENID GROWTH IN THE GULF OF MEXICO", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Hypotheses", "text": "I hypothesized that the growth rate of fishes would vary among estuaries based on the static spatial drivers of estuary drainage area, distance of marsh edge habitat, area of freshwater habitat, and relative depth. Further justification for each variable is given below. H1: Estuary drainage area. -The drainage area of a watershed is a major factor in estuarine productivity (Mallin et al. 1993) and links between terrestrial inputs and aquatic food webs are well-documented (Pace et al. 2004;Abrantes and Sheaves, 2008). Factors within a watershed such as rainfall and river discharge will affect the rate of freshwater, detritus, and nutrient input into an estuary, estuarine circulation and coastal-ocean exchanges, and regulate primary productivity and production at higher trophic levels (Mallin et al. 1993). For humid areas such as this study region, I hypothesized that the growth rate for all three species would be positively related to total estuary drainage area due to higher primary productivity rates resulting from increased detritus and nutrient inputs. H2: Relative freshwater habitat. -A preference for freshwater habitats has been observed for juvenile black drum, red drum, and spotted seatrout (Whaley et al. 2016;Thomas and Smith 1973). Freshwater habitats also offer refuge for juveniles from large marine predators (Stewart and Scharf 2008), thereby increasing feeding opportunities. Lab and aquaculture experiments have shown that several fishes exhibit optimum growth at certain salinities (Boeuf and Payan 2001). Fishes that spend time in salinities that are outside their optimum salinity range may have increased metabolic costs that will decrease growth rate. I hypothesized that the amount of freshwater area within an estuary would increase the growth rate of all three species. Although there is a temporal component to this variable on a finer-scale (e.g., estuary salinity), I am considering it from a broad scale using long-term averaged data. Furthermore, the estimated freshwater area among individual estuaries did not vary widely from year to year in these data. H3: Marsh edge habitat. -The marsh edge ecotone is an important nursery habitat for many larval and juvenile estuarine fishes (Baltz et al. 1993;Stunz et al. 2002b). Larval and juvenile fishes use the marsh edge habitat as shelter from predators and because it is a food-rich environment . I hypothesized that the total distance of marsh edge within an estuary would be positively related to growth rate, such that more marsh edge habitat would result in higher growth rates in all three species. H4: Relative depth. -Many estuarine fish species seek shallow water habitat as juveniles (Weinstein 1979;Stunz et al. 2002a). The physical characteristics of an estuary such as depth and volume may also affect the growth of fish due to increased predators with increasing depth and volume, and increased prey diversity and habitat-availability (e.g., shelter from predators) in shallower habitats. Furthermore, shallower estuaries may be warmer, resulting in higher rates of primary productivity than in deeper estuaries. I hypothesize that the relative depth (an areaadjusted depth variable) of an estuary would affect the growth rate of fishes, such that estuaries with higher relative depth (shallower estuaries) will have increased growth rate for all three species."}, {"section_title": "Length-at-age data", "text": "To evaluate the spatial variation of fish growth among estuaries of the GoM, I used data collected from fisheries-independent sampling programs, including Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC), Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries (LDWF), and Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD). Data were available from a variety of gears (e.g., both fisheries-dependent and -independent sampling); however, to reduce the effect of gear selectivity (Taylor et al. 2005) I used only fish collected from fishery-independent gill net, seine, trammel net, and trawl surveys (see Appendix C). Red drum and spotted seatrout length-at-age data were available for 18 estuaries in Texas, Louisiana, and Florida (Figure 4.1). Black drum length-at-age data were available for 12 of those 18 estuaries and each state was represented.  "}, {"section_title": "Gulf of Mexico", "text": "In Florida, the FWC conducts monthly stratified-random sampling (Fisheries-Independent Monitoring (FIM) program) and uses a 21.3-m seine in water depths of 1.8 m or less, while the trawl typically samples water depths of 1.8 m or greater.

The bridle. The length of the bridle is 2-3 times the trawl width. Tow line length is normally at least 4-5 times the maximum depth of water. The trawl is towed for ten minutes (measured from the time when the trawl first begins to move forward to the time when it stops forward movement) at a constant speed and in a weaving or circular track to allow the prop wash to pass on either side of the trawl. In Texas, a 183-m long experimental monofilament gill net is used to sample finfish. The net is 1.2 m in depth and composed of four 45.7 m panels of 76, 102, 127, and 152 mm stretch mesh . Sample sizes of fish varied by species, estuary, and years collected (see Appendix B). See section 3.2.1 for details on otolith aging, fork length to total length conversions, and outlier removal. Because biological ages were not available for all datasets, the models used whole ages for all datasets, for consistency. Black drum and red drum remain in natal estuaries as juveniles for around 3-6 years before maturing and moving offshore to join the adult population ; . Because I wanted the growth rate of the fish to reflect the environment in which it was assumed to be, I truncated the length-at-age data to include only up to age-3 for all species. Once fish leave estuaries and join the adult population offshore, the effect of estuary-specific static spatial drivers is likely to be dampened and thus, adult data (age > 3) were excluded.

In recent years, the role of environmental and other factors unrelated to fishery exploitation, such as climate change , landscape variables (Wagner et al. 2007), and pollution (Amara et al. 2009) have been of increasing concern for fisheries managers. Additionally, focus has been given to macrosystems ecology Levy et al. 2014) and cross-scale interactions  to examine how ecological processes that operate on continental scales influence local ecological processes. These types of studies represent a shift toward a desire to manage populations in ecologically relevant units and align policy with spatial patterns of population dynamics, rather than pooling a collection of substocks based on political boundaries. Additionally, by considering macrosystems ecology and cross-scale interactions managers may gain an understanding of broad-scale ecological processes that effect fish populations and assess the impact of various management regimes ). Furthermore, identifying ecological processes that are important for the growth of fish will aid managers in the future given uncertain environmental conditions (e.g. sea-level rise, reduced freshwater input; . Macroscale processes and cross-scale interactions are difficult to quantify because they require years of sampling and large amounts of data to detect a significant interaction . However, previous research has found that estimated von Bertalanffy growth model parameters of bass populations were related to latitudinal gradients , and measures of lake productivity were related to the variation in mean length-at-age of fish in Michigan lakes (Wagner et al. 2007). My results suggest that sciaenid growth varies among GoM estuaries; however, static spatial drivers such as estuary drainage area, distance of marsh edge, relative depth, and relative freshwater area are not strong, significant drivers of that variation. However, I did find evidence of a moderate effect of relative depth on black drum growth and distance of marsh edge for female spotted seatrout growth."}, {"section_title": "Static Spatial Drivers", "text": "The distance of marsh edge within an estuary was found to have a moderately significant effect on female spotted seatrout growth rate. For all three species, distance of marsh edge was predicted to have a positive effect on growth rate. I hypothesized this relationship because marsh edge habitat has been shown to be important for estuarine species (Baltz et al. 1993. Previous research found that red drum growth rate was highest in salt marsh and seagrass habitats (Stunz et al. 2002a) and my results suggest a positive relationship between sciaenid growth and distance of marsh edge. However, I did not have data for estuarine seagrass bed area, which might have been useful to incorporate into these models. It has also been suggested that the arrangement and complexity of estuarine habitats are more important than one single characteristic (MacRae and Cowan 2010) and perhaps a measure of habitat complexity would be more informative than one single characteristic. Relative depth was found to have a moderately significant effect on black drum growth rate but not in the direction I expected. I hypothesized that relative depth would be positively related to growth rate, yet for both drum species growth rate was negatively related to relative depth (larger, shallower habitats result in slower growth rates). This may be because drums reach relatively large sizes early in life and do not need to seek refuge from predators, thus allowing them to exploit better feeding opportunities in deeper water. Additionally, shallower estuaries may have higher temperatures that are outside of thermal optima and results in decreased growth and increase metabolic stress. The mechanisms behind the relationship of relative depth and growth rate are not entirely clear, yet it is clear that aspects of bathymetry (e.g. depth and volume) should be investigated further. I did not detect an effect of estuary drainage area or freshwater area on sciaenid growth for any of the three species. This is surprising because the importance of freshwater habitat to juvenile sciaenids is well documented Purtlebaugh and Allen 2010;Flaherty-Walia et al. 2015). It is possible that freshwater habitats are more important in early life but decrease in importance at later ages. Perhaps access to prey-rich marine waters becomes more important than seeking refuge in freshwater habitats with age. The least influential of all the environmental covariates appears to be estuary drainage area. This is surprising because estuaries with larger drainage basins are likely to have increased terrigenous inputs and, therefore, higher primary production (Mallin et al. 1993). Despite known relationships between estuaries and their watersheds, I was unable to relate the estuarine drainage area of estuaries to the observed variation of sciaenid growth to age-3. Perhaps metrics of rainfall within an estuary drainage area would better explain spatial variation than estuary drainage area, but rainfall has a temporal aspect to it, which I avoided in this study. This study is limited because it does not account for any biological or temporally-variable drivers. Biological drivers such as anthropogenic influence (Forrester et al. 2003), predator-prey dynamics , density dependence (Bacheler et al. 2012), and fishing mortality have been previously hypothesized to affect the growth of estuarine fishes. Additionally, temporallyvariant and finer-scale environmental factors such as salinity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, sediment structure, and food availability also likely contribute to fish growth . The effects of environmental factors on growth are well documented in the literature; however, evaluating many of these variables is best done in a controlled laboratory or mesocosm setting (Craig et al. 1995;Fontaine et al. 2007). Nevertheless, future analyses may consider these drivers. Although I failed to identify a major driver of sciaenid growth, I anticipated the possibility of this outcome because quantifying the relationships between environmental conditions and fish populations is difficult (Rose 2000), because so much noise is present in natural systems detecting a strong signal of an effect can be challenging. Despite a failure to identify strong, significant effects of static spatial drivers on sciaenid growth rate, I did find variation in growth rate among GoM estuaries. Therefore, future studies should continue to further evaluate the spatial variation and drivers of fish growth within estuaries of the GoM. The emergence of macrosystems Levy et al. 2014) and cross-scale approaches ) in fisheries will allow researchers to answer ecological questions on regional and local scales and better understand the spatial variation of fish populations. These new macrosystem approaches will foster management of ecologically relevant populations based on population dynamics, and an alignment of policy with spatial patterns of population dynamics. CHAPTER 5. GENERAL CONCLUSIONS"}, {"section_title": "Thesis Summary", "text": "Given the ubiquity and overall importance of growth modeling to fisheries science, knowledge of the methodological trends is useful when evaluating the growth of fishes. Additionally, when assessing populations on a large scale, recognizing the spatial and sex-specific variation of growth can improve growth model fit (DeVries and Grimes 1997; Williams et al. 2012), and investigating macrosystems processes ) and cross-scale interactions  can offer insight into the ecological drivers of those processes. Studies such as this-which include all of these components-better evaluate the dynamics of growth and obtain a deeper understanding of study species than those that simply estimate and compare von Bertalanffy parameters (Bertalanffy 1938;. This study sought to examine historical trends in growth modeling in fisheries science and evaluate the growth of three, culturally and economically important sciaenid species in the Gulf of Mexico using a suite of growth modeling techniques. In Chapter 2, I examined historical trends in the use of growth models in peer-reviewed fisheries literature and compared those trends to the trends in approach to growth modeling in NOAA stock assessments. I found a recent shift in the peer-reviewed fish growth literature to increased use in multi-model frameworks and an accompanying shift in model selection methods from general goodness-of-fit procedures to Akaike Information Criterion  and other information theoretic options. Despite these advances in the peer-reviewed fish growth literature, I did not see a commensurate shift in approaches in NOAA stock assessments. Additionally, when considering species taxa, maximum size, and habitat I did not detect any trends in relation to modeling approaches. In Chapter 3, I evaluated the fit of multiple growth models on black and red drum, and spotted seatrout. Prior research has indicated that the von Bertalanffy growth model (VBGM) may not fit sciaenid life history dynamics well ). This study confirms that the VBGM is not the best growth model to describe the growth of these species. A biphasic model (double von Bertalanffy) better described the growth of drums in Louisiana and Texas, and linear, sigmoidal, and seasonal growth models better fit spotted seatrout length-at-age data. I also found that Texas fishes were estimated to grow to a larger mean maximum size than Louisiana fishes, and Louisiana fishes grew at a faster rate than Texas fishes. Furthermore, I evaluated sex-specific growth models for all three species and found that they each exhibited sexually dimorphic growth. In Chapter 4, I evaluated the variation of growth rate for subadult fishes in the estuaries of the Gulf of Mexico. Estuaries are unique environments  and the conditions within those estuaries have been hypothesized to affect the growth of inhabitant species . I found that black drum, red drum, and spotted seatrout growth rate varies significantly among Gulf of Mexico estuaries, but was unable to relate variation in growth rate to static spatial drivers of estuaries. The static spatial drivers of estuary drainage area, distance of marsh edge, relative depth, and area of freshwater habitat did not explain the variation in growth rate. However, relative depth and distance of marsh edge had a moderately significant effect for some species. Thus, habitat and bathymetry characteristics within estuaries may potentially play a role in fish growth and further research should be directed in this area. Overall, this thesis has identified major trends in the methodology in growth modeling, provided an in-depth analysis of growth models on sciaenid species, and evaluated hypotheses regarding spatial drivers of sciaenid growth by linking spatial drivers to length-at-age analyses. Because of the recreational, cultural, and economic importance of sciaenids across their range, and the importance of accurately estimating growth of fishes to fisheries management, I believe this research will be of interest to fisheries researchers and managers not only along the Gulf coast but also in other regions where sciaenids are found. Although further studies will be necessary, this thesis serves as an initial step toward understanding the spatial variation of sciaenid growth and the effect of spatial drivers on sciaenid growth in the estuaries of the Gulf of Mexico.
