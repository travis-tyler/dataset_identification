[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The issue of gender disparities in students' academic achievement has a long tradition in educational research. In almost all Western countries, significant gender differences in students' proficiency in reading and, to a lesser extent, in mathematics occur in the first years of schooling. Large-scale assessment studies in schools, such as the Progress in International Literacy Study (PIRLS), the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), and the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), give us information on gender disparities at different age levels. In all of these studies, test scores are scaled to an overall mean of 500 and a standard deviation of 100. As indicated by gender-specific analyses, fourth-grade girls outperform boys in reading by an average of 13 points across Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries (PIRLS: McElvany, Kessels, Schwabe, & Kasper, 2017;Mullis, Martin, Foy, & Hooper, 2017, p. 36). In mathematics, a small advantage of 5 points for boys has been observed (TIMSS: Mullis, Martin, Foy, & Hooper, 2016;Wendt, Steinmayr, & Kasper, 2016). The gender gaps in both subjects further increase at the lower secondary educational levels. In the PISA 2015 test, 15year-old girls outperformed their male peers in reading achievement by 27 points on average across OECD countries, whereas boys scored an average of eight points higher on mathematics tests than girls (OECD, 2016, pp. 168-169, 196-197). Although these gender gaps in reading and, to a lesser degree, mathematics in the later school years are substantial, boys' and girls' linguistic and mathematical skills are more similar upon school entry (Fryer & Levitt, 2010;Mengering, 2005;Robinson & Lubienski, 2011). This evidence raises the question of why gender gaps emerge and widen during the early years of schooling. According to social-psychological theories of socialisation, gender differences in academic interests and behaviours are likely due in part to the influences of significant others, such as parents, peers, and teachers. These theories assume that significant others confirm or disconfirm a child's behaviour based on their gender-specific expectations towards that child (cf. Trautner, 2008). With school enrolment, teachers play an important role in students' reading acquisition and mathematics learning. Thus, their gender-specific expectations may be important facilitators in the widening of gender gaps. The current study investigated this assumption and examined whether the effects of gender-specific teacher expectations of students' performance contributed to differences in reading and mathematics achievement between boys and girls at the beginning of schooling. The analyses were based on data from a study specifically designed to investigate teacher expectancy effects among first-grade students in Germany."}, {"section_title": "Teacher expectations towards boys and girls", "text": "Many studies indicate that teacher expectations of student performance differ by student gender, regardless of their actual achievement (gender bias). Nevertheless, the evidence remains somewhat inconsistent. Some international studies have indicated that teachers overestimate the linguistic skills of girls more often than those of boys (Hinnant, O'Brien, & Ghazarian, 2009;Ready & Wright, 2011), whereas boys have been more favourably regarded in mathematics (Jussim & Eccles, 1992), even when girls and boys show similar achievement levels. However, some studies have not found any differences in teacher expectations for boys and girls when controlling for students' actual achievement (McKown & Weinstein, 2008;Van den Bergh, Denessen, Hornstra, Voeten, & Holland, 2010). In Germany, the situation is similar. Some studies have found no gender bias in teacher perceptions regarding student achievement in reading (Karing, Matth\u00e4i, & Artelt, 2011) or mathematics (Schrader & Helmke, 1990). Other studies have identified that teachers consider male students to perform better in mathematics than female students when actual student achievement is kept constant (Holder & Kessels, 2017;Tiedemann, 2002). Stahl (2007) reported overestimations of girls' performance in reading. Similarly, the study by Lorenz, Gentrup, Kristen, Stanat, and Kogan (2016) indicated a positive bias of teacher expectations in linguistics for girls compared to boys. No gender bias in mathematics was identified in this study. However, these studies have investigated gender differences in teacher expectations when accounting for students' actual achievement but not when accounting for teacher perceptions of further student learning resources. As argued by Schrader and Helmke (1990), as well as Robinson-Cimpian, Lubienski, Ganley, and Copur-Gencturk (2014), teacher expectations are likely to be coloured by teacher perceptions of student characteristics other than achievement. Substantial overlaps for different indicators of teacher expectations of student achievement and teacher perceptions of student motivation and work habits have been identified. For example, a student seen by his or her teacher as motivated and hardworking is more likely to be considered more talented and better performing (Anders, McElvany, & Baumert, 2010;Schrader & Helmke, 1990) and more likely to receive better grades (Anders et al., 2010;Kuhl & Hannover, 2012) and track recommendations (Anders et al., 2010;Timmermans, De Boer, & Van der Werf, 2016) than their lower estimated classmates who, in fact, perform similarly on achievement tests (cf. Gentrup, Rjosk, Stanat, & Lorenz, 2018). As teachers generally perceive girls as being more motivated and more eager to learn (e.g., Anders et al., 2010;Jussim & Eccles, 1992;Jussim, Eccles, & Madon, 1996) and as behaving better at school (e.g., Glock, 2016;Glock & Kleen, 2017), the gender differences in teacher expectations may be partly attributable to teacher perceptions of student motivation and work habits. Following this assumption, Robinson-Cimpian et al. (2014) analysed gender bias in teacher perceptions of students' mathematics achievement when their perceptions included their ratings of students' behaviour and effort. Whereas no gender differences were found in teacher perceptions of students' mathematics performance when controlling for students' current achievement, an advantage for boys became apparent when the authors also took into account teacher perceptions of student behaviour and effort (Robinson-Cimpian et al., 2014). Similar results were found by Gentrup, Rjosk, et al. (2018), indicating that teachers expected girls to perform equivalently to boys in mathematics only if the teachers observed girls as being more eager to learn and as working harder than their male classmates. In contrast, the female advantage in teacher expectations regarding student reading performance could be fully explained by teacher perceptions of student motivation and work habits (Gentrup, Rjosk, et al., 2018). Robinson-Cimpian et al. (2014) referred to this phenomenon as a conditional overand underestimation. As an illustrative example, take the result that student gender did not significantly predict teacher expectations in mathematics when accounting for actual achievement. If this result indicated unbiased expectations, no gender difference should occur when boys and girls share similar levels of other characteristics, such as teacher perceptions of student motivation and work habits. The more similar boys and girls were in terms of various characteristics, the smaller the gender differences in teacher expectations should become (cf. Robinson-Cimpian et al., 2014). If taking teacher perceptions of student motivation and work habits into account increases gender gaps, we refer to this situation as a conditional overor underestimation. In summarising the results based on this logic, it seems reasonable to assume that gender-specific teacher expectations exist but depend to some degree on teacher perceptions of student motivation and work habits. Such gender-specific teacher expectations may contribute to gender gaps through the process of self-fulfilling teacher expectations or teacher expectancy effects (Merton, 1948;Rosenthal & Jacobson, 1968)."}, {"section_title": "Teacher expectancy effects", "text": "The research on the effects of teacher expectations traces back to the experiment \"Pygmalion in the Classroom\" by Rosenthal and Jacobson (1968), testing the idea of self-fulfilling prophecies in the context of a school. It is widely assumed that self-fulfilling prophecies in the classroom follow a sequence of three major steps (Jussim, Robustelli, & Cain, 2009): (1) teachers form inaccurate expectations, that is, expectations that are too high or too low compared to actual student characteristics, such as achievement and motivation; (2) teachers treat high-and low-expectancy students differently; and (3) students react to this differential treatment in a way that confirms the teachers' initial expectations. The assumption that teacher expectancy effects emerge and, thus, that teacher expectations may influence students' learning in the direction of their expectations is widely supported (for overviews, see Jussim et al., 1996;Jussim et al., 2009). Most studies stem from the US, but there are some studies from Europe as well (e.g., Germany: Friedrich, Flunger, Nagengast, Jonkmann, & Trautwein, 2015;Lorenz, 2018;Stahl, 2007;The Netherlands: De Boer, Bosker, & Van der Werf, 2010;Jungbluth, 1993). However, teacher expectancy effects are generally small in magnitude. Measured as effect size d, the average effect was d = .30 (Jussim et al., 2009). When investigating gender disparities in student achievement, there are two possible mechanisms through which teacher expectancy effects may contribute to gender gaps. The two mechanisms should not be viewed as mutually exclusive; rather, they may complement each other. First, boys and girls may differ in their vulnerability to teachers' biased expectations (moderation perspective). Specifically, boys in reading and girls in mathematics may be more vulnerable to teachers' underestimations, as the lower expectations would be compatible with common gender stereotypes. For the same reason, girls in reading and boys in mathematics may benefit more strongly from teachers' overestimations. This mechanism may contribute to gender disparities even if teacher expectations are not systematically biased by student gender (but are randomly inaccurate for individual students independent of their gender, as inaccuracy is a precondition of teacher expectancy effects). For example, a teacher may hold positively biased expectations for all of his or her students in reading, but girls may benefit more strongly from these overestimations because the high expectation is compatible with the stereotype \"girls read well\". As a result, girls would develop especially advanced reading skills, whereas boys' learning would increase only slightly. This process, therefore, would contribute to more advanced reading skills among girls than among boys. Second, teacher expectations may influence student achievement through self-fulfilling prophecies, and because boys and girls have different probabilities of being over-or underestimated in reading and mathematics, teacher expectations may contribute to students' differing achievement gains (mediation perspective). In contrast to the first mechanism, this mechanism requires teacher expectations that are not only inaccurate but also systematically biased by student gender (cf. Lorenz et al., 2016). To make this precondition clear, let us assume a hypothetical class with 20 students -10 boys and 10 girls. If boys and girls are equally likely to be overestimated by teachers, then, for example, two boys and two girls would be seen as performing better than they actually are. As a consequence of teacher expectancy effects, both boys and both girls would perform better throughout the school year, and therefore, no contribution to gender differences would emerge. Only if boys and girls are unequally likely to be over-or underestimated would such processes contribute to gender gaps; that is, if, in our hypothetical class, four boys and only two girls became targets of overestimations, more boys than girls would benefit from positive teacher expectancy effects and, as a result, would lift the average male performance above the average female performance. The state of evidence regarding both possible mechanisms will be described next."}, {"section_title": "Gender-specific teacher expectancy effects: a moderation perspective", "text": "The assumption that teacher expectancy effects might be gender specific is based on research on stereotype threat. In performance situations when stereotypes are salient, members of groups stigmatised by a stereotype may show poorer performance because of the anxiety of confirming the stereotype, which is known as stereotype threat (Steele & Aronson, 1995). Common gender stereotypes include girls being less talented in mathematics and boys being less successful in the linguistic domain, such as in reading (cf. Heyder & Kessels, 2013;Steffens & Jelenec, 2011). Thus, the negative effects of stereotypes are reasonable to assume for girls in mathematics and for boys in reading. A large number of studies support the existence of stereotype threat effects for girls in mathematics (for a meta-analysis on school-aged girls, see Flore & Wicherts, 2015). For boys in reading, stereotype threat is less often investigated, but the existing literature supports this phenomenon as well (e.g., Latsch & Hannover, 2014;Pansu et al., 2016). However, studies have observed not only negative effects of stereotypes for the stigmatised group (stereotype threat) but also positive effects for the non-stigmatised group (stereotype lift; e.g., Latsch & Hannover, 2014). In this case, the benefit in performance is triggered by a negative outgroup stereotype. This downward comparison is assumed to enhance confidence, motivation, and self-efficacy in members of the non-stigmatised group and thus result in better performance (cf. Walton & Cohen, 2003). Following these results of stereotype threat research, boys in reading and girls in mathematics may be more vulnerable to underestimations by their teachers, as lower expectations would be compatible with common gender stereotypes. In addition to general teacher expectancy effects, these stereotype-compatible teacher expectations may increase boys' and girls' fears of confirming the gender stereotype while reducing cognitive capacity and motivation. Eventually, these expectations may lead to lower achievement of boys in reading and of girls in mathematics and thus result in achievement levels that confirm both teacher expectations and gender stereotypes. In addition, similar to stereotype lift, positive expectancy effects might be stronger for girls in reading and for boys in mathematics. Ultimately, both processes would lead to student achievement that confirms common gender stereotypes. Thus, boys would perform worse in reading, and girls would lag behind in mathematics. To date, three studies have examined the issue of gender specificity in teacher expectancy effects; in other words, these three studies have tested the assumption of student gender serving as a moderator. Jussim et al. (1996) evaluated possible overall gender differences in the effects of teacher perceptions on mathematics test scores and final sixth-grade marks without considering gender-specific responses to negative and positive bias. Gender differences occurred only when predicting students' final sixth-grade marks in mathematics based on teacher perceptions of students' maths talent. These effects were found to be stronger for girls than for boys. In fact, teacher perceptions of maths talent were positively related to students' final marks only for girls. No gender differences were found for teacher perceptions of student performance or teacher perceptions of student effort. Furthermore, no gender differences were apparent for any of the variables when students' mathematics test performance was predicted instead of final sixth-grade marks. However, as teacher perceptions were captured as a linear predictor without including quadratic terms, the analyses could detect overall gender differences in the magnitude of the effects only. To examine the assumed reversed responses of boys and girls to positive and negative bias, a quadratic term for teacher perceptions would be necessary. Two more recent studies took this issue into account. De Boer et al. (2010) examined moderation in the prediction of an indicator of overall school success (a score on the education ladder that combined the grade level and school track), controlling for an overall student performance score covering linguistic and mathematical achievement as well as meta-cognitive skills. Teacher expectation bias was subdivided into seven categories ranging from severe negative expectation bias to severe positive expectation bias. The category \"no bias\" served as the reference category. The analyses revealed no gender specificity in teacher expectancy effects for any of the six categories of teacher expectation bias. However, as an overall student performance score was investigated, the analyses allowed for no conclusion to be drawn on domain-specific moderation. Furthermore, the non-significant findings may be a result of opposing response patterns in the linguistic and mathematical domains, as one would expect based on evidence from stereotype threat research. The study by McKown and Weinstein (2002) took this issue into account and investigated whether male and female first-, third-, and fifth-grade students differed in their response to teacher over-and underestimation in mathematics and reading, separately. After investigating linear and quadratic interactions between biased teacher expectations and student gender, which did not show any significant moderation, McKown and Weinstein (2002) divided the students into different groups. Teacher expectation bias was categorised into underestimated expectations, overestimated expectations and accurate expectations. Furthermore, student achievement development was subdivided into students whose skills improved, declined, or remained stable. Combining these two variables, students were categorised into confirmers (whose actual achievement development corresponded with the direction of the over-or underestimation by their teacher) and disconfirmers (whose actual achievement development was in opposition to their teachers' over-or underestimation). Students who were accurately estimated by their teachers and students whose skills remained stable were excluded from this categorisation and from further analyses. Comparing the resulting eight groups of male and female underestimated confirmers, overestimated confirmers, underestimated disconfirmers, and overestimated disconfirmers, McKown and Weinstein (2002) computed hierarchical log-linear models. The results indicated that in the fifth grade, girls were more likely to confirm teachers' underestimations in mathematics and less likely to confirm overestimations than boys. However, such gender differences were found for neither firstand third-grade students in mathematics nor students in any school grade in reading. As McKown and Weinstein (2002) concluded, these results, as well as the lack of significant interactions with continuously measured teacher expectation bias, may be due to the small sample sizes, composed of 121 first graders, 222 third graders, and 218 fifth graders. In summary, the evidence on the possible moderation of teacher expectancy effects by student gender remains insufficient and inconclusive. Only three studies have examined this issue, and only one study has conducted domain-specific analyses separating the response to positively biased expectations from the response to negatively biased expectations and therefore was able to detect the theoretically assumed response pattern. Moreover, the existing results remain widely inconclusive. Current evidence supports no gender specificity in reading and no gender specificity for most students in mathematics, but there may be gender specificity in mathematics for a special subgroup of students. However, due to the small sample sizes in the study by McKown and Weinstein (2002), it remains possible that boys and girls in general differ slightly in their response to negative and positive bias in reading and mathematics. Thus, further studies expanding the base of evidence on gender-specific teacher expectancy effects are needed. Finally, as none of the studies compared direct gender effects on reading and mathematics achievement gains with and without controlling for biased teacher expectations and their interaction effects, it remains unclear whether and to what extent teacher expectancy effects contribute to domain-specific gender disparities when taking their possible gender specificity into account."}, {"section_title": "Teacher expectancy effects and the gender gap: a mediation perspective", "text": "According to Ludwig (2007), even though direct evidence linking gender gaps to teacher expectancy effects is rare, the compositional evidence for the separate steps among student gender, teacher expectations, and academic achievement supports a contribution to the gender gap on its own. First, empirical evidence reinforces that teacher expectations vary with student gender beyond actual student achievement, and second, biased teacher expectations have been identified as likely self-fulfilling and therefore affecting student achievement gains. The evidence summarised in the previous sections suggests that gender-specific teacher expectation bias may occur, but the results, nevertheless, remain somewhat inconclusive. Therefore, it is worthwhile to conduct direct analyses of the assumed contribution of teacher expectations to gender differences in student achievement. To date, only two studies have directly investigated the extent to which teacher expectations mediate gender achievement gaps. The study by De Boer et al. 2010examined the contribution of teacher expectations to gender gaps in an overall indicator of school success. They found no support for the assumption that teacher expectations significantly contributed to gender differences on this measure. However, as gender gaps appear to be domain specific, it is worthwhile to conduct separate analyses on linguistic and mathematical achievement. Robinson-Cimpian et al. (2014) directly investigated the extent to which prior and current teacher perceptions of students' maths proficiency mediated the gender gap in mathematics. According to their considerations mentioned above, they examined this issue while taking teacher perceptions of students' behaviour and effort into account. Their study was based on data from more than 10,000 firstand third-grade students participating in the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten (ECLS-K). They conducted various analyses, including traditional mediation models and analyses based on matching approaches. The results consistently indicated mediations by teacher perceptions of students' maths proficiency. However, the mediated proportions differed substantially among the analytic approaches, grade levels, and indicators of teacher perceptions of student proficiency, from under 1% to up to 85%. Therefore, Robinson-Cimpian et al. (2014) were cautious in concluding what exact proportion of gender gaps in mathematics was due to teacher perceptions. Aside from the strength of capturing various analytic approaches, the study had two limitations that are especially relevant in the context of expectancy effects. Both limitations concern the indicator of teacher perceptions of students' maths proficiency. First, teacher perceptions referred to students' current achievement and therefore did not represent teacher expectations of future achievement. Second, and most importantly, for many students in the study, teachers had changed from a \"prior\" to a \"current\" measurement point, that is, from kindergarten to first grade and from first to third grade. This arrangement is problematic because the perceptions of one teacher will not shape other teachers' behaviour in class and, therefore, may not initiate a self-fulfilling prophecy. Due to both limitations, the evidence provided by this study was not related to teacher expectancy effects in their essence. Thus, further studies investigating this mediation that are better suited for analysing teacher expectancy effects are needed, as are studies examining this issue in the reading domain."}, {"section_title": "The current study", "text": "Based on these considerations, the current study examined whether the effects of teacher expectations contributed to differences in achievement between boys and girls at the beginning of schooling while considering two possible mechanisms: (a) student gender as a moderator of teacher expectancy effects and (b) teacher expectancy effects as a mediator of gender achievement disparities. The current study took a two-domain perspective and investigated gender differences in reading as well as in mathematics. Very little research has been conducted in this field, especially for reading. Furthermore, the current study considered earlier results supporting teachers' conditional over-and underestimations of boys and girls depending on teacher perceptions of student motivation and work habits, and it included these measures in the models. Specifically, the following two research questions were analysed: (1) Does the magnitude of positive and negative teacher expectancy effects differ for boys and girls in reading and mathematics? (moderation perspective) On the basis of theoretical considerations, we expected gender-specific teacher expectancy effects in reading as well as in mathematics. We expected boys and girls to be more vulnerable in reading and mathematics, respectively, to the effects of negatively biased teacher expectations. Conversely, boys and girls might benefit more strongly in mathematics and reading, respectively, from the effects of positively biased teacher expectations. (2) Does gender-specific teacher expectation bias mediate the link between student gender and achievement development in reading and mathematics during first grade? (mediation perspective) In line with the findings by Robinson-Cimpian et al. (2014) in mathematics, we expected gender-specific teacher expectancy effects to partly explain emerging differences in mathematics achievement in first grade between boys and girls. In reading, we assumed a contribution of gender-specific teacher expectations as well.

The total sample included N = 1,065 first-grade students from N = 67 classrooms. Classes in which the teachers changed during the school year were excluded from the analyses. Furthermore, we had to exclude one student because of missing gender information. These exclusions left N = 1,025 students from N = 64 classes in N = 38 schools.

For example, the teachers were asked, \"Compared to his/her fellow students, how well do you expect this child to perform at the end of the school year? \u2026 in German language/ \u2026 in mathematics?\". The teacher rated the items on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 = far below the class average to 5 = far above the class average.

Following the considerations by McKown and Weinstein (2002), we used the cut-off criterion of 0.3 standard deviations, which indicates a medium-sized effect in the typology of effects sizes by Cohen (1988). In the next step, we categorised the students' achievement responses. Therefore, we predicted student end-of-year achievement based on the students' prior achievement, cognitive abilities, motivation, and self-concept. The resulting residual scores depicted the extent to which endof-year achievement deviated from what one would predict based on students' prior skills and motivation. In line with the procedure of categorising teacher expectation bias, we divided these achievement residuals into three categories: improved (residual score more than 0.3 standard deviations above the mean), declined (residual score more than 0.3 standard deviations below the mean), and remained stable (residual score within 0.3 standard deviations of the mean). Subsequently, we combined the two categorisations, identifying students whose achievement developed in the direction of teachers' biased expectations. These students were labelled confirmers (positive bias and improved achievement or negative bias and declined achievement). In the cases in which student achievement developed in the opposite direction of teacher expectations bias (positive bias and declined achievement or negative bias and improved achievement), the students were assigned to the group of disconfirmers. Students who were targets of no bias or whose achievement remained stable were not further categorised and were excluded from the subsequent analyses."}, {"section_title": "Testing the hypotheses", "text": "Gender-specific teacher expectancy effects: moderation assumption We first examined the question regarding gender-specific responses to teacher expectations (Research Question 1). Therefore, we conducted separate analyses for reading and for mathematics. We began by modelling three-way interactions among student gender, teacher expectation bias, and squared teacher expectation bias in predicting students' end-of-year achievement, controlling for prior student achievement, cognitive abilities, age, and family characteristics. The squared term of teacher expectation bias was included to model non-linear relationships. Second, seeking to replicate models by McKown and Weinstein (2002), we investigated whether male and female students differed in their likelihood of confirming or disconfirming teachers' biased expectations as a function of whether the expectations were negatively or positively biased. Therefore, we used the categorisations of teacher expectation bias (negative bias and positive bias) and student responses (confirming or disconfirming) and conducted logistic regression analyses predicting students' likelihood of confirming or disconfirming teacher expectation bias as a function of student gender, and positive versus negative teacher expectation bias, controlling for students' age and family background."}, {"section_title": "Contribution to the gender gap: mediation assumption", "text": "After investigating gender specificity in teacher expectancy effects, we evaluated the extent to which the effects of teacher expectations contributed to gender gaps in students' early achievement (Research Question 2). Therefore, we first calculated linear regression models predicting students' end-of-year achievement based on student gender, age, and family characteristics (socioeconomic status, educational level, and immigrant status). In a second model, we added students' beginning-of-year achievement and measures of their general cognitive abilities. This second model captured a calculation of gender gaps in students' end-of-year achievement that existed beyond differences in students' prior achievement, general cognitive abilities, age, and family characteristics. This model and a third model that additionally controlled for teacher perceptions of student motivation and work habits served as references for the final model, which also included teacher expectation bias. A comparison of the magnitude of the gender effect from these models would provide evidence of potential mediation by teachers' biased expectations. In the case that prior analyses provided support for gender-specific teacher expectancy effects, we included relevant interaction terms in the final model. Table 1 shows descriptive statistics for all variables separately for boys and girls. As the mean differences in the residual scores of teacher expectations indicated, teachers expected higher reading achievement for girls (M = 0.13, SD = 0.76) than for boys (M = \u22120.11, SD = 0.77), accounting for students' actual achievement but not for differences in teacher perceptions of student motivation and work habits; t(1023) = \u22125.19, p < .001, r = .16; that is, girls were more likely to be overestimated by their teachers in reading achievement, whereas boys became the target of negatively biased expectations more frequently, when teacher perceptions of student motivation and work habits were not taken into account. In mathematics, no gender differences in teacher expectation bias (girls: M = \u22120.02, SD = 0.69, boys: M = 0.02, SD = 0.67) occurred; t(1001) = 1.11, p = .27, r = .04. However, opposing findings emerged when teacher perceptions of student motivation and work habits were also accounted for. With regard to similarly performing students whom the teacher perceived as being equally motivated and similarly behaved in school, boys became targets of higher expectations in mathematics than girls; t(1001) = \u22124.43, p < .001, r = .14. In reading, the gender difference decreased when teacher perceptions of student motivation and work habits were accounted for; t(1023) = 2.17, p < .05, r = .07.

In both domains, positive and negative bias varied between 30% and 42% for boys and girls (see Table 1). As revealed by t tests on the underlying continuous variables of teacher expectation bias, the scores were significantly different from zero and therefore indicated negative or positive bias (see Appendix 1). Furthermore, the descriptive results indicated some differences in achievement between boys and girls. Whereas male and female students showed similar phonological awareness and reading skills at the beginning and at the end of first grade (all t tests were non-significant), boys (M = 28.81, SD = 8.41) were already outperforming girls (M = 25.06, SD = 7.19) in mathematics at the beginning of first grade; t(1023) = 7.64, p < .001, r = .23.

Second, we examined gender differences in confirming and disconfirming teacher expectations.\nAnalyses on the first research question revealed no support for gender-specific teacher expectancy effects for the overall student sample in reading or mathematics. In other words, considering all participating students, negatively and positively biased teacher expectations affected boys' and girls' learning to a similar extent. Further analyses on this research question focused on a subgroup of students. These students were targets of relatively strong bias in teacher expectations, and their achievement development differed from what was expected based on their prior achievement, cognitive abilities, motivation, and self-concept. In this specific subgroup, girls in mathematics were, as hypothesised, more affected by negatively biased expectations than by positively biased expectations and were more vulnerable to negative teacher expectation bias than boys. For boys, the likelihood of confirming teacher expectation bias did not vary significantly with the value of bias, but it showed a higher tendency for positive bias. In other words, and in line with our assumptions, in this specific subgroup of students, girls were shown to be more vulnerable to negative bias and to be less supported by positive bias in mathematics, whereas boys tended to be more likely to benefit from positive bias than to suffer from negative bias. In reading, no such differences in boys' and girls' vulnerability to expectancy effects was apparent. Overall, our result patterns were in accordance with the findings of McKown and Weinstein (2002). First, both studies identified no gender difference in teacher expectancy effects in the overall student sample. Second, in both studies, gender-specific responses to teacher expectation bias for students who were targets of relatively strong bias occurred only in mathematics. However, with regard to students' grade level, our results, which were based on first-grade students, were not in line with those of McKown and Weinstein (2002), who found gender-specific response patterns in fifthgrade students but not in firstor third-grade students. This finding may have arisen due to the small number of first-grade students in their sample compared to our sample. In comparing our results and those of McKown and Weinstein (2002) with the findings of Jussim et al. (1996), it is essential to distinguish between the indicators of teacher perceptions considered as well as between the two mathematics-related outcome variables. All three studies consistently found no support for overall gender differences in teacher expectancy effects in mathematics when examining mathematics test scores as a dependent variable. However, further findings by Jussim et al. (1996) indicated that this result did not emerge for maths grades as an outcome. Here, stronger effects of teacher perceptions of students' maths talent were observed for girls than for boys. As final maths grades are, strictly speaking, teacher judgements themselves, this result can be interpreted as a stronger overlap between two forms of teacher judgement for girls than for boys. Summarising the results, we conclude that in reading, teacher expectancy effects were independent of student gender. 2 This also seems true for most students in mathematics. However, in mathematics, teacher expectations may reinforce gender-stereotypic achievement development for the student group with the strong bias in teacher expectations mentioned above. Further studies should focus on this special group, which is not small in number (44% of the participating students in our study), and investigate the characteristics of students belonging to this group. Do they possibly perform at the extremes of the mathematics achievement distribution? Are students from different social backgrounds equally represented? Additionally, it seems worthwhile to conduct further analyses on the genderspecific mechanisms linking negatively biased expectations to disadvantages in girls' learning and positively biased expectations to advantages in boys' development."}, {"section_title": "Reading", "text": "An investigation of continuously measured teacher expectation bias revealed no significant interaction terms between student gender and either teacher expectation bias or squared teacher expectation bias (see Appendix 2). In other words, these analyses did not provide support for gender differences in teacher expectancy effects for boys and girls in reading. Equally, when examining boys' and girls' likelihood of confirming or disconfirming teacher expectations as a function of positive and negative bias, no gender differences emerged (b = 0.49, p = .15; see Appendix 3). According to these analyses, boys and girls were equally likely to confirm (or disconfirm) teachers' biased expectations in reading (b = \u22120.42, p = .14). Furthermore, students' sensitivity towards teacher expectations appeared to be independent of whether teacher expectations were positively or negatively biased (b = 0.05, p = .88).\nAs Model 1 in Table 2 indicates, female students showed somewhat higher reading skills at the end of first grade than their male classmates (\u03b2 = .14, p < .05) when taking differences in their age and family background into account. This female advantage decreased (\u03b2 = .08, p = .11) when students' beginning-of-year phonological awareness, reading skills, and general cognitive abilities were also taken into account. Thus, even though female students overall outperformed male students in reading at the end of first grade, they did not show greater achievement gains during the year. The subsequent addition of teacher perceptions of student motivation and work habits and teacher expectation bias to the models further reduced the regression coefficient of student gender to values close to zero. However, this reduction was not statistically significant (both \u0394\u03b2 nonsignificant); that is, teacher expectation bias did not substantially mediate the direct link between student gender and end-of-year reading achievement. Further, it is remarkable that the prediction of students' reading gains by teacher expectation bias decreased (from \u03b2 = .16, p < .001 [model not displayed; for more details, see ] to \u03b2 = .08, p = .06) if teacher perceptions of student motivation and work habits were included in the model. However, teacher perceptions of student motivation and work habits remained a significant predictor of student reading gains (\u03b2 = .17, p < .001)."}, {"section_title": "Mathematics", "text": "The results investigating continuously measured teacher expectation bias in mathematics were similar to the results for reading. No significant interaction between student gender and teacher expectation bias or between student gender and squared teacher expectation bias occurred (see Appendix 4). However, the logistic models investigating boys' and girls' differential responses to teachers' positively or negatively biased expectations showed significant results. When predicting students' likelihood of confirming teachers' biased expectations in mathematics, a significant interaction effect between student gender and positive versus negative bias (b = \u22121.44, p < .001; see Appendix 5), as well as a significant main effect of gender (b = 0.61, p < .01), occurred while controlling for students' age and family background. The main effect of positive bias was not significant (b = 0.52, p = .12). Figure 1 illustrates the differing response patterns for boys and girls in mathematics. As post-hoc analyses comparing student responses within and between genders revealed, girls were more likely to confirm negatively biased teacher expectations than were boys (effect of comparison between girls being targets of negative bias and boys being targets of negative bias: b = 0.61, p < .01). Conversely, boys were more likely to confirm positively biased teacher expectations than were girls (b = 0.83, p < .01). Furthermore, girls were generally less likely to confirm positively biased than negatively biased teacher expectations (b = \u22120.92, p < .05). For boys, the difference between their response to positively and negatively biased teacher expectations was non-significant (b = 0.52, p = .12). In summary, the analyses that included the whole sample revealed no gender specificity in teacher expectancy effects for reading or mathematics. As a result, we did not include any interaction terms in further analyses investigating the contribution of teacher expectancy effects to gender achievement gaps for the overall sample.\nIn mathematics, a significant gender difference in students' end-of-year achievement emerged (see Table 3). On average, taking students' age and family background into account, boys showed approximately 0.47 standard deviations greater mathematics skills at the end of first grade than their female classmates (\u03b2 = \u2212.47, p < .001). After additionally controlling for students' prior mathematics achievement and cognitive abilities, this advantage for boys decreased but remained statistically significant (\u03b2 = \u2212.23, p < .001). Therefore, on average, boys gained 0.23 standard deviations more mathematics skills in first grade than their female classmates who had similar beginning-of-year achievement, cognitive abilities, age, and family characteristics. Furthermore, teacher expectation bias significantly predicted students' end-of-year achievement in mathematics (\u03b2 = .07, p < .001). Nevertheless, the advantage of boys did not substantially change when teacher expectation bias was added to the model (\u0394\u03b2 non-significant); that is, the stronger achievement gains of boys in mathematics seem to occur independently of teacher expectations and their effects on end-of-year mathematics achievement. "}, {"section_title": "Gender gap and teacher expectations: mediation perspective", "text": "To investigate the extent to which teacher expectancy effects contributed to gender gaps in reading and mathematics (Research Question 2), we calculated four stepwise models that included further predictors of student end-of-year achievement.\nThe results regarding the second research question, which investigated the extent to which teacher expectancy effects contributed to gender achievement gaps, contradicted our assumptions. Neither in reading nor in mathematics did teacher expectancy effects substantially contribute to gender gaps in first-grade students. In conclusion, according to our findings, the overall impact of the effects of teacher expectations on emerging gender gaps was negligible. Therefore, our findings contradicted the results presented by Robinson-Cimpian et al. (2014). As the data in our study covered teacher expectations measured prior to student achievement and from teachers actually working with the students, we directly investigated teacher expectancy effects in terms of a self-fulfilling prophecy. Thus, the underlying data were better suited to examine the contribution of teacher expectancy effects to gender gaps. Further, aside from issues of domain specificity, our results were in accordance with the findings of De Boer et al. (2010). However, as our study investigated effects only within the short time period of almost one school year (on average, 8 months passed from the first to last measurement points), one may assume that a meaningful contribution of teacher expectations to gender gaps in mathematics may still be possible in the long term. This assumption would be compatible with the results by Robinson-Cimpian et al. (2014), whose models covering a 1-year period (kindergarten to first grade) showed somewhat smaller effect sizes than models covering 2 years (first grade to third grade). However, De Boer et al. (2010) investigated mediation in overall performance over a 5-year period and did not find support for a substantial contribution to the gender gap. In conclusion, it would be possible, though somewhat unlikely, that substantial mediation effects in mathematics might become salient only over longer time periods. However, given the results on girls' greater vulnerability to negatively biased teacher expectations in the subgroup of students experiencing relatively strong bias in teacher expectations, stronger contributions to the gender gap in mathematics may be found in this subgroup. Further research on this issue would be worthwhile. For reading, our study revealed no gender gaps in students' achievement development during first grade. Accordingly, teacher expectancy effects did not significantly contribute to a gender gap in reading. Thus, additional studies in later school years, when gender-related reading disparities become stronger (OECD, 2016), should investigate whether teacher expectancy effects play a more important role later in this process. As the current study and the research by McKown and Weinstein (2002) observed no gender-specific responses to teacher expectations in reading, it seems reasonable to assume that teacher expectancy effects in the early school years are less important for gender gaps in reading than they may be in mathematics. It is possible that gender stereotypes stigmatising girls in mathematics are more common than stereotypes disadvantaging boys in reading. To our knowledge, there is no research directly comparing the prevalence of the girls' maths stereotype to the boys' reading stereotype. In the context of stereotype lift, Walton and Cohen (2003) argued that men (and Whites) are seen as ordinary in most domains of society and that they are thus less likely to be targets of negative or positive stereotypes. Additionally, the overall small number of published studies on stereotypes in the reading domain might indicate that the boys' reading stereotype is less prevalent. However, further investigation is needed to provide more information on this issue."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The current study investigated the role of teacher expectations in early gender disparities by analysing two complementary research questions. First, we examined whether boys and girls differed in their vulnerability to teacher expectancy effects. Second, we analysed whether gender-specific effects of teacher expectations contributed to the emerging gender gap in reading and mathematics in the first year of schooling."}, {"section_title": "Limitations and future research", "text": "The present study has some limitations that should be addressed in future research. First, this study did not examine the role of teachers' gender. As almost all participating teachers were female, the results are transferable only to classrooms taught by female teachers. Thus, the role of teachers' gender in the transmission of teacher expectations remains unclear. It might be argued that a gender match between student and teacher may reduce the threat originating from negatively biased teacher expectations, as the lower estimations stem from an in-group judge (cf. McKown & Weinstein, 2002). In contrast, one may argue that a gender match strengthens the negative effects because students identify themselves more strongly with same-sex teachers, whom they may see as role models. Although our study did not focus on this issue, the results speak to the latter assumption. In our study, female students who were taught by female maths teachers were more adversely affected by negatively biased expectations than were boys. In contrast, no specific disadvantages for boys who were taught by female teachers in reading occurred. Further studies should examine this issue in more detail. Second, in this study, it was not possible to entirely conclude whether the observed relationships between teacher expectation bias and end-of-year achievement were due to causal effects. The longitudinal study design, which was characterised by minimal teacher-student contact before measuring teacher expectations and students' prior achievement as well as by various measurements of student characteristics, such as general cognitive abilities and different indicators of students' family background, reduced the number of possible influences that may have provided alternative explanations. However, influences of other variables not considered in this study are possible. Further, the interplay between teacher expectation bias and teacher perception of student motivation and work habits in predicting student achievement is subject to discussion and raises some issues for future research. Both teacher judgements substantially predicted student end-of-year achievement when prior achievement, general cognitive ability, and background characteristics were controlled for. However, when both teacher judgements were simultaneously included in the models, in reading, only teacher perception of student motivation and work habits remained a significant predictor. This result supports the assumption that teachers' perceptions of their students' motivation and work habits may have an impact on student achievement, at least in reading, beyond their achievement expectations. However, the substantial overlap between the two measures, indicating that students who were assumed to work hard were also more likely to become targets of overestimations, makes it difficult to determine cause-effect relationships. Further, this phenomenon occurred only in reading, which may be because in our study, all reading teachers were class teachers. Those teachers are strongly involved in instructing first-grade students on school and class rules. In contrast, some of the maths teachers were responsible only for maths lessons. However, this did not apply to all maths teachers. Future research should try to disentangle the effects of the two teacher judgementsespecially in the early years of schooling, when compliant school behaviour is a major educational goalwhile investigating student motivation and work habits as well as student achievement in reading and mathematics as outcomes. In conclusion, the current study indicated that, overall, gender-specific teacher expectations did not contribute to the gender gap, especially for reading outcomes, during the first year of schooling. However, the finding that some students were more vulnerable to teachers' over-or underestimations of mathematics achievement calls for future studies in this domain. Notes 1. We also conducted all analyses on the sample of female teachers and their students; in other words, we excluded male teachers and their students from the analyses. All results were equal to the reported results for the overall sample. 2. Teacher expectation bias significantly predicted end-of-year reading achievement only when teacher perceptions of student motivation and work habits were not taken into account. This finding was due to a substantial overlap between the two measures, indicating that students who were assumed to work hard were more likely to become targets of overestimations. However, as substantial effects of teacher expectation bias occurred when entered separately into the models, the results indicated teacher expectancy effects in reading as well. "}]
