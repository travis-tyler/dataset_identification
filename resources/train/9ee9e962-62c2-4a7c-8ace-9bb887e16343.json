[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "For patients with cognitive disorders and dementia, accurate prognosis of cognitive worsening is critical to their ability to prepare for the future, in collaboration with health-care providers. Despite multiple efforts to apply computational brain magnetic resonance image (MRI) analysis in predicting cognitive worsening, with several successes, brain MRI is not routinely quantified in clinical settings to guide prognosis and clinical decision-making. To encourage the clinical use of a cutting-edge image segmentation method, we developed a prediction model as part of an established web-based cloud platform, MRICloud. e model was built in a training dataset from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) where baseline MRI scans were combined with clinical data over time. Each MRI was parcellated into 265 anatomical units based on the MRICloud fully automated image segmentation function, to measure the volume of each parcel. e Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) was used as a measure of cognitive function. e normalized volume of 265 parcels, combined with baseline MMSE score, age, and sex were input variables for a Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression analysis, with MMSE change in the subsequent two years as the target for prediction. A leave-one-out analysis performed on the training dataset estimated a correlation coefficient of 0.64 between true and predicted MMSE change. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis estimated a sensitivity of 0.88 and a specificity of 0.76 in predicting substantial cognitive worsening after two years, defined as MMSE decline of \u22654 points. is MRICloud prediction model was then applied to a test dataset of clinically acquired MRIs from the Johns Hopkins Memory and Alzheimer's Treatment Center (MATC), a clinical care setting. In the latter setting, the model had both sensitivity and specificity of 1.0 in predicting substantial cognitive worsening. While the MRICloud prediction model demonstrated promise as a platform on which computational MRI findings can easily be extended to clinical use, further study with a larger number of patients is needed for validation."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Cognitive disorders and dementia, heterogeneous conditions that include various brain diseases, are common in old age. Regardless of the diagnosis, one of the greatest stressors for dementia patients and caregivers is future uncertainty surrounding change progression of their condition. In clinical care settings, including memory clinics, medical providers make the best possible clinical diagnosis to inform the patient and caregivers about future progression, the type of care needed, problems that might occur in the future, and how to prevent or ameliorate these problems [1] . Accurate, individualized ways to predict cognitive progression, ones that could easily be applied in typical clinical settings, would be a great advance with huge clinical benefit for patients and caregivers.\nMany neuroanatomical predictors of cognitive decline have been identified in previous studies of cognitively normal or cognitively impaired elders. ese best imaging predictors involve atrophy in selected brain structures, such as areas of the mesial and lateral temporal lobes, the posterior cingulate, the orbitofrontal gyri, and white matter hyperintensity [2] [3] [4] . Non-neuro-anatomical predictors [5] , such as age-with younger having worse prognosis [6] , baseline cognitive function [7] [8] [9] , and vascular risk factors [10] , are well established. However, individualized prediction (precision medicine) of future decline based on individual variables is difficult because each factor only weakly correlates with the outcome, and often overlaps and interacts with other factors. Integration of these variables is, thus, essential for accurate prediction [11] [12] [13] [14] . For such integration, important features that relate to disease progression must be extracted and recorded in a standardized quantitative manner. However, a widely available platform that could enable such quantification and integration has not been established.\nIn an initial attempt to develop clinically useful individualized prediction, we used a web-accessible, cloudbased platform MRICloud (https://mricloud.org/) [15] to achieve image standardization, quantification, and crossvariable integration. An integrative cloud platform is the critical enabling technology for the proposed prediction as it requires a large amount of atlas resources and intensive computation. While previous research has succeeded in predicting cognitive outcomes for research populations [3, 13, 16, 17] , one of the greatest barriers to clinical application is fragmentation of analysis pipelines, which require aggregation of various tools with different capabilities on different platforms to extract a prediction value from a single image. MRICloud provides for seamless integration of wholebrain segmentation and subsequent prediction. Moreover, it enables users to develop their own applications using its programming interfaces. For example, users can implement their own data processing and analysis pipeline in MRICloud.\nis flexibility is particularly important in the era of machinelearning and artificial intelligence where rapid improvement, advancement, and innovation are expected.\nHeterogeneity in symptoms and comorbidities encountered in clinical practice, compared to research populations with strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, is one of the major causes for which research discovery has not made its way to clinical application, as pointed out by [14] . In the era of \"big data\" science, the application of a trained algorithm to real-world data is necessary to validate its usefulness in day to day clinical practice.\ne MRICloud platform is promising for such a validation study since it enables the collection of raw MRIs from all over the world through its web interface. To test this concept, we applied a prediction model, developed on a research cohort, to a real clinical population of cognitively impaired patients to investigate the applicability of the prediction model to a heterogeneous clinical setting."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Training Dataset.", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (https://adni.loni.usc. edu).

If there is an a priori hypothesis about the distribution of the pathologic tissues, predefinition of the size and shape of parcels can follow the hypothesis. However, impaired anatomical structures and spatial distribution depend on the disease severity seen in the brain MRI, which are unknown prior to the analysis. To account for the heterogeneity of this patient population, we applied a tool that can flexibly change the granularity level based on the hierarchical relationships of 254 structures defined in our atlas [27] , in which the 254 structures were assigned a hierarchical relationship based on their ontological relationship [28, 29] . is relationship consists of five hierarchical levels that were named: Level 1 (11 parcels); Level 2 (17 parcels); Level 3 (36 parcels); Level 4 (54 parcels); and Level 5 (254 parcels) ( Figure 1 ). e volumes of all structures in each level were obtained."}, {"section_title": "Non-Image Features.", "text": "Many non-image predictors of cognitive decline have been identified in previous studies of cognitively normal or cognitively impaired elders. ese can be summarized into seven major categories [5] : sociodemographics; clinical characteristics; cognitive or neuropsychological features; behavioral or psychological factors; cardiovascular risk factors; genetics; and biological markers. Although inclusion of all these factors into the prediction model might maximize the prediction accuracy, obtaining and recording such information comprehensively in a structured way is not a feasible standard for the vast majority of clinical care settings.

Among various cognitive measures, the MMSE was chosen because it is most commonly measured in patients who visit memory clinics and can easily be also measured in primary care settings. e LASSO regularization weight parameter \u03bb was selected in order to minimize a mean squared prediction error between the measured and the predicted \u0394MMSE obtained by leaveone-out cross validation. e normalized volume of anatomical units, baseline MMSE, age, and sex were used as a set of variables."}, {"section_title": "Validation.", "text": "To validate the prediction algorithm within the ADNI population, a leave-one-out analysis was performed to investigate the correlation between the measured and the predicted MMSE change. e analyses were performed based on level of granularity (Levels 1-5) and all levels combined. e predictor model that provided the best correlation with cognitive outcome in ADNI data was then applied to the clinical population.\nere is considerable debate about the disease-specific speed of cognitive worsening [32, 33] , although a metaanalysis suggested a similar pace of cognitive decline in two of the most common diagnoses of dementias, AD and dementia with Lewy bodies [34] . Faster cognitive decline is seen in autopsy-confirmed frontotemporal dementia (FTD) compared to AD [33] . Within the AD population, there are at least two distinctive types of disease progression, slow and rapid [7, [35] [36] [37] . Since we aimed to identify rapid progressors in the clinical cohort of mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia (MMSE \u2265 23) at baseline, and majority of the ADNI training data fall into this category (Table 1) , we used MMSE decline of \u22654 points after two years to define substantial cognitive worsening, according to the reported average decline in MMSE score over two years (3.3 points decline in MMSE score) in the mild AD population with a baseline MMSE score of 23 [38] . To investigate the accuracy to predict substantial cognitive worsening, ROC analysis was performed. e cutoff of the predicted MMSE change that maximized the Youden index [39] was adopted as the threshold to predict substantial cognitive worsening (true MMSE decline of \u22654 points). e glmnet package [31] implemented in R software [http://cran.r-project.org, R Core Team, version 3.2.3] was used for the LASSO regression analysis and the ROC curve analysis."}, {"section_title": "Implementation of the Prediction Model into the MRICloud.", "text": "e MRICloud provides a cloud-based architecture for neuroimage analysis tools through the web.

Although the MATC population consisted of patients with various clinical diagnoses or with mixed causes of cognitive decline, the sensitivity and specificity to predict rapid cognitive decline was comparable to that obtained from an ADNI cohort with strict inclusion and exclusion criteria. is was unexpected because we initially assumed that the prediction model trained from the ADNI dataset would be applicable only to patients with a clinical diagnosis of probable AD. One possible explanation is the existence of a spatial pattern in local brain atrophy related to an increased risk of cognitive worsening, which is less specific to AD, but rather common to various types of dementias. e applicability of the model to nonAD dementias, such as frontotemporal dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, or vascular dementia, needs to be further investigated.\nWe also noted overestimated prediction of MMSE decline for patients with a low baseline MMSE score (MMSE < 23).\nis was probably due to the relative imprecision of MMSE in measuring cognitive decline in demented patients [50] . is explains the results of the ROC curve analysis, in which the cutoff predicted MMSE change of \u22121.9 was higher than the true actual change in MMSE of \u22124.\nerefore, care should be taken when the predicted change is less than \u22121.9; in this case, the practical interpretation should be a \"MMSE change less than \u22124 can be predicted.\"\nOther limitations include the small clinical sample size, which may have involved selection bias or confounding factors, such as age. Indeed, this limitation was one of our motivations to develop an open-access platform for future validation study, in which MRIs from other institutes can be easily submitted to increase the number of test MRIs, as detailed in the next section. e method used to select the LASSO regularization parameter could also be an issue, since inappropriate selection leads to overfitting of training data; therefore, the performance measures for the training data (ADNI data) were possibly upward-biased.
