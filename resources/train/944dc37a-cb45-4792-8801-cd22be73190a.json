[{"section_title": "", "text": "The family farm is more than a profit maximizing enterprise. It is an asset whose productive life expectancy may extend well beyond that of its operator, and whose future value depends crucially on its continuous functioning; it is a place of residence for the farmer in old age; and it is attached to land, whose symbolic importance exceeds its economic value in many societies. Moreover, the market value of a farm is often well below its value as a 'going concern' and which points to the fact that consideration for retirement and succession cannot be disentangled from day-to-day farm management decisions (Dunaway, 1991). Gasson and Errington (1993) looked at the development cycle of the farm family and the growth and decay cycle of the farm business, and concluded that \"synchronizing these two cycles may itself be crucial for the continuance of the farm family business (p. 226).\" Clearly, intergenerational succession is one of the important links between those two cycles. Given the importance of succession in the farm sector, the purpose of this paper is to understand the process and those various farm, operator, household, and financial characteristics that affect an operator's decision to retire and designate a successor to the farm. The paper will also document the retirement horizon of farm operators. Finally, information will be provided to establish whether successors have been designated, and document whether the successor comes from within the operator's family."}, {"section_title": "Literature Review", "text": "A unique feature of the farming sector, as opposed to other sectors of the economy, is that businesses are traditionally passed on within the family. The study of farm succession already has a long tradition in the Rural Sociology literature (Gasson and Errington, 1993;Blanc and Perrier-Cornet, 1993;Carroll and Salamon, 1988;Coughenour and Kowlaski, 1977;Friedberger, 1983). However, agricultural economists have devoted little attention to this topic (Kimhi and Nachlieli, 2001;Weiss 1999). Most economics literature on the topic of farm succession is confined to a discussion of how succession is affected by tax considerations (Boehlje and Eisgruber, 1972;Harl, 1989;Harlin, 1992;Tauer, 1985). In the early 1990s economic historians examined farm succession practices while investigating Irish emigration (Guinnane, 1992;Kennedy, 1991). The phenomenon of predominant intrafamily succession is observed in many economies (Bryden et al. 1992). Kotlikoff and Spivak (1981) argue that intrafamily succession enables the extended family to enjoy the benefits of intergenerational risk-sharing when annuity markets are imperfect. Pesquin et al. (1999), mention additional advantages of intrafamily farm succession such as 'smooth' transition, reduction in transfer cost, and lower transfer taxes. Additionally, Tweeten and Zulauf (1994) point out that intrafamily farm succession allows entering farmers to overcome borrowing constraints, at least in commercial farms. Using panel data of Austrian farms, Weiss (1999) found a strongly significant effect of intra-family succession on farm survival. Kimhi and Nachlieli (2001) studied the likelihood of intra-family intergenerational succession on Israeli family farms. They found that age of the operator, level of schooling of the operator, and the age of the oldest child as significant factors in having an intra-family successor. Further, number of children and off-farm work did not have any impact on the probability of having a intra-family successor. The authors also found that farms with more land have lower probability of intra-family succession. Some studies in the literature relate to farm succession and farm investment. For example, Potter and Lobley (1992) show that the investment behavior (on-farm investment) of farmers without successors was radically different from that of those where a successor has been already identified. Perrier-Cornet et al. (1991) report that in France, the Netherlands, and Belgium, farm modernization is associated with intergenerational succession. However, farms located in the United Kingdom, Greece, and Italy did not show any significant relationship. Kimhi et al. (1995), using panel data of Israeli farms, found that during the 1970s succession contributed tremendously to farm expansion (both in terms of farm size and intensity of production). However, due to a widespread farm financial crisis in the 1980s, the expansionary phase did not continue. On the contrary, the farm financial crisis forced many successors to seek off-farm employment. Phimister (1994) argues that financial pressures arising from intergenerational farm asset transfers may have a negative impact on subsequent farm investment."}, {"section_title": "Sources of Retirement-Succession Plan Data", "text": "Data for the analysis are from the 2001 Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS)."}, {"section_title": "ARMS is conducted annually by the Economic Research Service and the National Agricultural", "text": "Statistics Service. The survey collects data to measure the financial condition (farm income, expenses, assets, and debts) and operating characteristics of farm businesses, the cost of producing agricultural commodities, and the well-being of farm operator households. The target population of the survey is operators associated with farm businesses representing agricultural production in the 48 contiguous states. A farm is defined as an establishment that sold or normally would have sold at least $1,000 of agricultural products during the year. Farms can be organized as proprietorships, partnerships, family corporations, nonfamily corporations, or cooperatives. Data are collected from one operator per farm, the senior farm operator. A senior farm operator is the operator who makes most of the day-to-day management decisions. For the purpose of this study, operator households organized as nonfamily corporations or cooperatives and farms run by hired managers were excluded. The 2001 ARMS collected information on farm households in addition to farm economic data collected through the regular survey. It also collected detailed information on off-farm hours worked by spouses and farm operators, the amount of income received from off-farm work, net cash income from operating another farm/ranch, net cash income from operating another business, and net income from share renting. Furthermore, income received from other sources, such as disability, social security, and unemployment payments, and gross income from interest and dividends was also counted. In addition, the 2001 ARMS queried farmers on their retirement from farm work and plans for the future of the farming operation (rent, sell the farm operation, turn the management and operation of the farm over to another partner and/or family member). In addition, farmers were also queried about whether they had developed a succession plan for their farming operation. These questions were developed to support research focused on the livelihood, savings, and investment choices of farm households. The farm, itself, is a significant, even dominant, component of the household portfolio of most farm households. As such, it is a source of earnings or wealth to help support expenditures of households at different stages of the life-cycle."}, {"section_title": "Respondent Demographics", "text": "There are nearly 2.0 million farm families in the U.S that are engaged in farming at some level. Although not all of them are actively involved in farming as a primary economic activity of the farm household, many choose to reside in rural areas. The average farm operator is about 55 years old and operates an average of 422 acres. Again, the size of operation varies by the commodities produced, location of the farm, and primary occupation of the farm operator. For example, operators who indicate that they are retired, operate (on average) a 153 acre farm. On the other hand, operators who indicate farming as their main occupation have an average of more than 2,400 acres in their operation. Several things stand out in American agriculture; (1) farms vary extensively in terms of acres operated and commodities produced; (2) farms are located in different regions ( Figure 1); and (3) farm households derive income from many sources, including off-farm work. Households' time allocation decisions (on-farm and off-farm) drive income levels. households. On average, 91 percent of farm operators' household income came from off-farm sources in 2001. Reliance on off-farm income, however, varied widely among different types of farm households. Due to off-farm income, average farm household income was particularly high in metro areas. However, it should be noted that the share of off-farm income varies with region, stage of the farm operators' and their spouses' life-cycle, and work choice of farm households. The 2001 ARMS asked farm operators about labor and employment decisions for farm operators and their spouses. In 2001, 46 percent of operators and 52 percent of spouses reported that a job other than farming was their principal occupation ( Figures 3 and 4). To obtain information about the employment choices made by farmers and/or their spouses, those who reported a principal occupation other than farming were asked a follow-up question focused on whether that occupation was the operator's or his/her spouse's career choice. Three-fourths of operators and four-fifths of spouses responded that their non-farm occupation was their career choice. Additionally, when operators were asked whether they and/or their spouse worked at an off-farm job prior to becoming a farm operator, a third of both operators and spouses reported working off-farm prior to running a farm business. Most farm operators who worked off the farm were employed by private companies. Private businesses were also the main employer for spouses, followed by government or schools ( Figure 5). The heavy emphasis in employment of operators and spouses by private companies or non-farm business ownership demonstrates the importance of the general economy to the financial status of farm households."}, {"section_title": "Retirement Plans of Farm Operators", "text": "The issue of retirement and succession is especially pertinent for farmers who are ready to retire in the next five years. Their retirement will have implications for farm wealth, industry structure, and the supply of food and fiber. Using the 2001 ARMS we have classified farm operators, based on retirement information, into five categories. The first category includes farm operators who indicate that they are already retired (about 13 percent of farm households). Second are farm operators who indicate that they will retire in the next five years (about 14 percent of households). Third are farm operators who are 65 years of age and are not retired nor plan to retire (9 percent of households). The fourth category includes farm operators (approximately 1 percent), who plan to exit based on off-farm work or business opportunities. The largest category (63 percent of households), consists of all other principal farm operators (Table 1). Information is provided to respond to five major questions concerning these retirement categories: (1) which farmers plan to retire as reflected by age, experience, work time, income levels and sources, and household net worth; (2) where they are located geographically; (3) what commodities they produce; (4) how much land they own and control; and 5what they plan to do with the farm upon retirement. Which Operators Plan to Retire? Over a fourth of principal or primary operators of farm businesses either now consider themselves to be retired (as a major occupation), or are planning to retire from farm work within the next five years. The average age for this group of 558,000 farmers is higher than the average for all farm households of 55 years. In fact, operators who report that they are retired average 70 years of age, and 76 percent are age 65 or older. Of those operators planning to retire from farming the average age is 62, with a fourth in the 55 to 64 years age group. Farmers who are either retired or are planning retirement tend to have a lot of experience. On average, retired operators have farmed for over 32 years, while those who are contemplating retirement have farmed 31 years. Nationally, the average for all farmers is 23 years. Spouses also bring a considerable amount of involvement and experience to farm business decisions. Over 40 percent of spouses of retired operators reported being a decision maker with this percentage rising to 56 percent for operators planning to retire. Nationally, over half of all spouses are reported to be a decision maker for the household's farm business. On average, spouses of operators who are planning to retire, report having 30 years of experience as a farm or ranch decision maker. The primary occupation of operators who are planning to retire from farm work is divided between farming and something else as it is for operators of farms from all households. For operators who are planning retirement, 36 percent report a non-farm primary occupation. This percent rises to 46 percent for all operators and to over 60 percent for operators who are not either retired, planning retirement, in the older age cohort (over 65 years), or planning a farm exit for non-farm business reasons. In addition to age, experience, and occupational differences, operators who are either retired or are planning to retire report substantial differences in timing of their decision to farm. Virtually all operators (94 percent) who consider themselves retired started farming prior to working at an offfarm job, if they ever worked off farm. For operators planning to retire in the next five years, the percentage who worked off-farm prior to farming rises to 24 percent, compared to 33 percent for all operators. Over two-fifths of operators outside those retired, planning to retire, or in the older age cohort worked off-farm first. The presence and timing of off-farm work is important from two vantage points. One is that off-farm work may affect eligibility for retirement income from off-farm sources and, second, coming to farming as a second activity may affect how households choose to use their farm properties in retirement or later life. Farmers who say that they are retired reported working a little over 700 hours per year, on average, in 2001 with 10 percent (70 hours) devoted to off-farm activities. Spouses of this group of operators worked less than 400 hours on average. Hours of work rise for the group planning retirement to about 2,200 hours, on average, or near the national average for all farm operators (which was reported to be slightly over 2,400 hours). These operators reported working over 600 hours, on average, or 28 percent of their work time off-farm. Nationally, operators spent 42 percent of total work time at off-farm jobs. Spouses of operators who plan to retire from farming worked about half as many hours (1,055), but a larger percent off-farm (61 percent). When asked about how the total hours worked off-farm had changed between 1996 and 2001 (the reference years of the survey), farmers who both work off-farm and had retirement plans reported that 55 percent worked about the same, 10 percent worked more, 13 percent worked less, 4 percent were unsure, and 18 percent did not report. Change in off-farm work time for this group is about the same as for all farmers nationally making it difficult to judge whether farmers with plans to retire from farming plan to pare back work generally or just to reduce the amount of time spent on their farming activities. The level and sources of income earned by farm households, based on retirement and exit plans, were different although consistent with the national average--off-farm income is the major source of total household income (Table 1). However, farm households planning to retire earned an average of $5,211 from farming, which is close to the average for all farm households. Even so, off-farm earnings remain the dominant source of income for these households as it is for all farm households. Sources of off-farm earnings vary substantially among households. Households with a retired operator report net losses from farming and income in excess of $46,000, on average, from off-farm sources. Unearned income sources account for 80 percent of total off-farm earnings, with Social Security and other public programs being the largest sources followed by interest and dividends. Farmland rental and other passive income sources account for about 12 percent of unearned income. For those operators currently planning retirement, household earnings flow from both farm and nonfarm sources. Unearned income accounts for 46 percent of off-farm income, with Social Security and other public program income sources amounting to about half that received by households of retired operators. Retiring farm operator households have substantial wealth, as measured by the net worth under their control. For example, the average net worth of farm operators who indicate that they will retire in the next five years is approximately $589,000, which is $45,000 more than the average farm household ($545,000). However, average non-farm net worth of those planning to retire was much lower ($44,000) than the average for all farm households ($93,000). This indicates a concentration of their assets in farming and a substantial share (97 percent) of their wealth tied to the farm, principally farmland. What Commodities Do They Produce? Operators who plan to retire, on average, produced $69,100 of agricultural output in 2001, compared with $80,400 for all farmers. Together they accounted for 12 percent of the value of agricultural production ( Figure 6). Given their disproportionate location in the Plains, Mid-west and other grain and oilseed production areas, it is not surprising that farmers planning retirement accounted for a fifth of wheat farms and over a fourth of corn and soybean operations. Farms managed by these operators generated about 15 percent of the value of corn, soybean and wheat production. How Much Land Do They Own and Operate? Households with operators who report retirement plans own 293 acres, on average, compared to 231 owned acres for all households, or about 18 percent of total land owned by operator households. In total, land owned by operators who report retirement plans amounts to about 87 million acres. Farmland owned by operators planning retirement is less than acreage operated (450 acres), as it is for all operators (422 acres). The difference is, of course, accounted for by land rented for cash or a share of crop and/or livestock output. Overall, farmers who report a planned retirement operate slightly more cropland acres on average (206 acres) than all farmers (190 acres)."}, {"section_title": "Plans for the Household's Farm Business?", "text": "In contemplating retirement from farming, households must consider the future of the farm. We asked operators if they planned to: 1) rent out the farm; 2) sell the farm; 3) turn over the management; or 4) make some other use of the farm. Approximately 39 percent of households indicated other uses of the farm. This is not clearly defined and needs further investigation. One possibility is to clarify what is meant by renting the farm. It is possible that enrolling in programs like CRP would not be considered renting by respondents. Or, those who are renting large acreage may let land revert to the land owner. However, 26 percent of operator households indicated that they intended to turn over the management and operation of the farm to others (either a partner or a family member), but retain ownership. Eighteen percent of households indicated that they plan to rent out the farm. Finally, approximately 17 percent indicated that they would sell the farm. For households who plan to retire from farming in the next 5 years, uses of the farm are similar to the national average; however, the distribution is a bit different. For example, a higher percentage of farm operator households (22 percent) indicate that they plan to rent out the farm and 20 percent indicated that they plan to sell the farm. With over 40 percent of operators planning retirement indicating that they plan to either rent or sell land they own, a substantial portion of the 87 million acres owned by this group will likely become available in farmland markets in the next several years. In addition the 46 million acres rented by this group of operators may also become available for rental by other households. Decisions with regard to future use or selling of the farm operation may reflect the timing and choice of career decisions of household members, potential long-term attachment to the land, and human capital of the operator and spouse. Farm operators and spouses who grew up on a farm may want to keep their farm (attachment to the land) within the family via farming, renting it, or preserving it for agro-tourism, or family members may want to retire on the farm. They may be less likely to sell the farm. This may also be the case for farm operators and spouses who work only on the farm (no-off farm job) and have endowed themselves with farm specific human capital. However, allegiance to the land may change as either the farm operator or spouse or both work off farm. Working off the farm, whether a career choice or part-time work, means that the household can make a living through off-farm work and members (farm operators and spouses) have human capital to compete in the off-farm labor market. Additionally, many off-farm jobs have fringe benefits (such as 401k retirement accounts and health benefits) which are some of the incentives for off-farm work. These jobs could lead to retirement from farming and eventually selling or renting the farm to a new generation of farmers. 2001 ARMS responses were partitioned to examine how households planned to use their farm based on work decisions and whether either the operator or both the operator and spouse were raised on a farm. Results indicate that households where neither the operator nor the spouse work off-farm and where operators were raised on a farm have a higher than proportionate share planning to turn over management of the farm to another partner or family member while retaining some ownership. The smallest share of households planning to turn over management were those in which operators either worked off farm first or where operators declared their off-farm occupation to be their career choice. In both of these cases, farms are substantially smaller businesses that contribute a second source of income to the household, along with a source of household wealth. In contrast, a larger than proportionate share of households where operators either worked off farm first or declared an off-farm primary occupation planned to either rent or sell their farm."}, {"section_title": "Succession Plans of Farm Households", "text": "Succession planning is a component of a household's risk management strategy for its farm business in as much as it is aimed at continuity of the business' management team. Data on the interrelationship between household's retirement and succession plans also provides additional information about how farms will be managed as they pass from the current generation of households. Four factors have a large effect on the succession/transfer of farm businesses. The most important is the owner's age (farm operator's age) followed by farm size, net worth, and the successor's ability to farm successfully. Nationally, a small percentage, 27 percent, of farm operators indicated that they had a succession plan. Of those, 87 percent reported that they had identified a successor, and in most cases the successor was a family member. When asked if the successor worked or participated in the farm business, 52 percent indicated that that the successor participated in the farm business. Further, 38 percent of designated successors were participating in management activities and decisions for the farm (Figure 7). About 34 percent of farm operators who indicated that they will retire in the next 5 years had a succession plan and about 80 percent of these households have a family member taking over the farm. Thirty-six percent of operators who plan to exit farming to pursue off-farm work or business opportunities have a succession plan and almost in all cases (93 percent) the successor is a member of the family. Identified successors for this group of operators are also more likely to be working in the business and making management decisions for the farm (73 percent). Farm operators who are above 65 years of age and have no retirement plans appear to be a little more organized in terms of having a succession plan than other groups of households, with about 40 percent of these households having succession plans. As with other groups, most of the successors are family members. But, while a large share of these farms reported a succession plan, a smaller share of these actually involved their successor in operation of the business than did farms in general ( Figure   8). Economic theory (and common sense) predicts a correlation between succession planning and age of the farm operator. Examining succession planning by age of the operator supports this notion. For example, only 16 percent of farm operators in the age group of 35 to 44 years have succession plans, while 40 percent of farm operators in the age group of 65 years or older have succession plans. In most cases the successor is a family member. Commercial farms (gross value of production >$250,000), which provide the majority of food and fiber, are likely to have an efficient farming operation because of size economies, including management. Since farming tends to be their main occupation the farm operator is more likely to have a succession plan compared to intermediate (gross value of sales of $100,000-$250,000) and rural residence farms (gross value of sales is less than $100,000). Results from our 2001 survey show that 33 percent of commercial farms have a succession plan compared to 25 percent of rural residence farms and 30 percent of intermediate farms. In the case of commercial farms, only 77 percent have successors who are family members, lower than other groups. However, significant proportions of operators of commercial farms report that the planned successor works and participates in the business (68 percent) and makes decisions (54 percent) for the farm. Succession planning becomes of greater importance to households when wealth is considered. Wealth, as reflected by net worth, can become an estate tax liability and planning can help ease the transfer of farms from one generation to another or to the party interested in entering farming. Maximization of wealth is assumed to be an individual and family objective and bequest motives are well rooted in economic and financial theories. The amount of wealth at stake in agriculture is relatively large, compared with most households. Examining succession planning by different levels of net worth reveals a picture that is consistent with theory. For example, only 16 percent of farm households with net worth between $50,000-$99,999 had succession plans, compared to 31 percent of farm households with net worth between $500,000-$999,999, and 44 percent of farm households with net worth over $1,000,000. Further, among net worth categories (mentioned above) with a succession plan, a successor has been designated and that person is most likely to be a family member. However, participation in business, management activities, and other decisions on the farm indicate that the involvement of the successor on the whole is relatively small (Figure 9)."}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "Of operators who indicated plans to retire, 22 percent reported their intent to rent their farm to another household while 20 percent reported that they would sell their business, generating cash for other uses by the household. Twenty six percent of these operators reported that they would turn over management of their farm business to another partner or family member, while retaining some ownership interest. Merging retirement plans with information reported by operators about their succession planning activity revealed that 34 percent of farms had a succession plan. Of this group, 88 percent reported a known successor with 76 percent reporting that the successor was a member of the operator's family. The percentage of operators who plan to turn management of their farming operation over to a partner or family member and the share who reported a succession plan with a known successor who was a family member align very closely. Both the percentage of having plans to turn management of the farm over to a partner or family member and the percentage of having a known successor who is a family member rise with size of the household's farming operation. Of households that operate commercial size farms, 46 percent plan to turn over management. Reported presence of a succession plan grew with size of the household's net worth, rising from 8 percent of households with less that $50,000 in equity to 44 percent for households with over a million dollars. Even for households with over a million dollars in net worth, the proportion with a known successor who was a family member and the share indicating that they would turn over management of the business upon retirement aligned very closely (40 and 38 percent respectively).
