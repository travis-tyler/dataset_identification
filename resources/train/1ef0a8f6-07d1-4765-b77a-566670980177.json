"}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The three major influencing factors on barrier island sustainability are sea-level rise (SLR), storm impacts, and sediment supply. Barrier evolution is governed by a complex balance between these three elements (Byrnes et al., 2013;McBride & Byrnes, 1997;Otvos & Carter, 2013;Twichell et al., 2013). Sea-level rise alone is causing many of the world's sandy coastlines to erode dramatically (Bird, 1985(Bird, , 1996FitzGerald et al., 2008). If any of these factors fall further out of balance, a barrier may become unstable and approach runaway transgression (FitzGerald et al., 2006). Documentation exists for unprecedented erosion of Gulf coast barrier systems associated with accelerated sea-level rise punctuated by storm impacts relative to geologic timescales (Anderson et al., 2010(Anderson et al., , 2014Wallace and Anderson, 2013). The northern Gulf of Mexico margin is currently one of the most vulnerable sections of coastline in the United States (Pendleton et al., 2010). Over shorter timescales, sediment redistribution along the Mississippi/Alabama barrier chain is controlled primarily by fair-weather, long-shore processes and sediment removal from the system occurs largely due to storms (Byrnes et al., 2013;Otvos & Carter, 2008;Twichell et al., 2013). These large scale processes at play in barrier systems, and the current state of SLR, storms, and sediment budgets are fairly well understood for this section of the Gulf of Mexico, however few field-based studies quantitatively examine spatial and temporal trends of barrier island evolution (Byrnes et al., 2012;Otvos & Carter, 2008Walstra et al., 2012). Modern studies tend to focus on sediment volume changes only below water level, and area changes on subaerial (above MHW) portions of islands (Byrnes et al., 2012;Morton, 2008;Walstra et al., 2012). The current state of knowledge renders it difficult to describe short term topo/bathy geomorphic processes particularly before and after storm events. Here we aim to quantify both subaerial and subaqueous sediment volume changes on a particularly vulnerable and dynamic island along the Mississippi/Alabama barrier chain, Ship Island, in order to understand geomorphic evolution associated with barrier island change forcing mechanisms.\nBarrier island systems are ecologically unique. They form the boundary between the high-energy marine environment and low-energy back-barrier marshes, bays or sounds. They are composed of unconsolidated sediments, and are therefore dynamic. Storms, sea-level rise, and sediment supply are the primary controlling factors on their formation, stability, or demise (Byrnes et al., 2013;McBride & Byrnes, 1997;Otvos & Carter, 2013;Twichell et al., 2013). They often provide the most seaward extension of terrestrial and shallow-water ecosystems, and therefore provide habitats to many coastal marine organisms (Handley et al., 2007). One of the most crucial organisms present in these systems is seagrass, a type of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV), as it provides the base of many of these shallow water ecosystems (Orth et al., 2006). The northern Gulf of Mexico margin is currently one of the most vulnerable sections of coastline in the United States (Byrnes et al., 2013). Given the recent documentation (Chapter 1) of storm and fair-weather evolution of a particularly dynamic barrier island in the MS/AL chain, Ship Island, this presents a unique opportunity to examine the impact of coastal change on these important SAV habitats."}, {"section_title": "Geologic Setting", "text": "Located along the Mississippi coast, Ship Island is a part of the MS-AL barrier island chain ( Figure 1). Ship Island is a part of the Gulf Islands National Seashore. Only a few man-made structures exist on West Ship Island, including the historic Fort Massachusetts, built in the 1860's. Based on heavy mineral provenance (Otvos, 1978), eastern (Appalachian) and western (Mississippi Delta) sources demonstrate the importance of shore-parallel sediment delivery for barrier-shoal construction (Otvos, 2005). Progradational features of the west Mississippi islands reflect this process (Otvos & Giardino, 2004). Based on OSL ages, the western Mississippi barrier islands are documented to be active between ca. 4.6 and 3.7 ka (Otvos & Giardino, 2004), and the adjacent 42-km long New Orleans (Pine Island) barrier-shoal complex (Saucier, 1963(Saucier, , 1994) conforms with these ages (Saucier, 1963;Otvos, 1978;Stapor and Stone, 2004). The barriers stabilized at a relative SLR rate less than 2 mm/yr (Gonz\u00e1lez & T\u00f6rnqvist, 2009;T\u00f6rnqvist et al., 2004;T\u00f6rnqvist et al., 2006), in contrast to local or Gulf-wide regression (Otvos, 2005). Modern relative SLR rates in the area of Ship Island 3 are 4.10 +/-0.92 mm/yr (NOAA Bay St. Louis/Waveland Buoy), averaged between 1978 and 2015, approximately double the rate at which the barriers stabilized. Barrier sands overlie early Holocene muds that lie ~8 m below the subaerial portion of Ship Island, and extend out ~3 km beyond the shoreline. Barrier sands are onlapped partially by St. Bernard prodelta muds at their most shoreward edge, and shoreface sands are currently topped by a modern erosional unconformity (Twichell et al., 2013). The Mississippi-Alabama barrier island chain is located in the Northern Gulf of Mexico. East and West Ship Islands are shown here in relation to surrounding inlets and the two adjacent islands. Significant wave height influencing the barrier chain is low with an average of 0.7 m in the winter and 0.4 m in the summer (NDBC -Buoy 42007). The depth of closure (DOC) for the area is ~7 meters, calculated using USACE Wave Information Studies data over the past 33 years (Brutsch\u00e9 et al., 2014). This depth of closure value is verified geologically by the presence of modern muds onlapping the barrier sands (i.e., shoreface toe) beginning at a depth of 8-10 meters on the shoreface. The islands also experience relatively low tidal energy, with a mean tidal range of 0.45 m and a diurnal range of 0.49 m (NOAA tide gauge 8744756). The region is frequently impacted by hurricanes and other storms, with 13 tropical storms passing within 100 km of Ship Island since 1960 (NOAA Historical Hurricane Tracks). Hurricane impacts occur here approximately every 10-12 years (Byrnes et al., 2012 (Fritz et al., 2007;Waple, 2005). Geomorphological responses to these events are recorded as the island has been topographically and bathymetrically mapped once before and several times after the Katrina impact using Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)."}, {"section_title": "Controls on Barrier Island Geomorphology", "text": "Sea-Level Rise. SLR is an important factor of barrier island land loss and disappearance, particularly when considering geologic timescales (Bird, 1985(Bird, , 1996FitzGerald, et al., 2006FitzGerald, et al., , 2008. An acceleration of SLR or a rate of rise that is faster than the barriers can keep pace with can result in runaway transgression and eventual drowning (FitzGerald et al., 2008;Anderson et al., 2010Anderson et al., , 2014. Considering the relative SLR rate at which Ship Island stabilized (~2 mm/yr), and the current relative SLR rate,"}, {"section_title": "5", "text": "(4.1 mm/yr), the system is currently in a state of adjustment and disequilibrium. By the end of this century, both the magnitude and rate of eustatic rise is expected to increase by two to three times (Thomas et al., 2004;Church & White, 2006;Overpeck et al., 2006;Pfeffer et al., 2008;Church et al., 2013). Healthy barrier island systems respond to SLR in a way that conserves their mass as they migrate landward (FitzGerald, et al., 2008). This is made possible, in part, by the presence of a back-barrier marsh. Marshes reduce water velocity, and consequently erosion on the back barrier. They also provide a foundation for the barrier to transgress upon and reduce tidal prism moving through the inlets (FitzGerald, et al., 2008). However, no fringing marshes currently exist on Ship Island. The lack of a low energy wetland behind the MS-AL islands, and the large, relatively deep open water of the Mississippi Sound makes Ship Island vulnerable to erosion. Both the shoreface and backbarrier are exposed to high energy waves, and the barrier chain experiences an essentially infinite tidal prism. The chain is therefore highly fragmented, and tidal deltas sequester much of the sediment in the system (FitzGerald, et al., 2008). Rather than conserving mass as they transgress, the MS-AL barriers continuously narrow as they move landward in response to SLR (Morton, 2008). Storm Impacts. Storm impacts cause dramatic geomorphologic changes along MS/AL barrier island systems over short timescales (days to years) (Otvos & Carter, 2008). Increases in storm frequency or strength could remove more sediment to the back barrier area via overwash and breaching than can be replaced by fair weather processes in a given period, and the island will become increasingly segmented before disappearance (FitzGerald et al., 2008;Sallenger, 2000). Ship Island has been periodically breached during storms along its vulnerable, low-lying central section (i.e. barrier neck), with the first recorded occurrence in 1852 (Morton, 2008;Otvos & Carter, 2008). East and West Ship Island have been separated and re-unified several times since then by natural islandhealing processes (Otvos & Carter, 2008). This was possible with sufficient longshore sediment supply for natural spit growth and eventual island healing between storm impacts (Byrnes et al., 2012;Otvos & Carter, 2008) (Table 1). "}, {"section_title": "7", "text": "In the past century the region has been frequently impacted by hurricanes and tropical storms (Table 1), but Camille and Katrina caused the most significant and lasting geomorphic changes on Ship Island. Katrina significantly expanded Camille Cut, almost completely eroding away the low elevation portion of East Ship, and caused severe shoreline erosion in other parts of the island (Fritz et al., 2007;Morton, 2008). Significant sediment redistribution can also occur due to cold front storms passing through the area. These systems can produce strong northerly winds and high enough wave energy to erode the back-barrier beaches (Stone et al., 2004). In some cases, these events can be more erosive, particularly in an environment with a large back-barrier fetch like the MS-AL barriers (Byrnes et al., 2012;Otvos & Carter, 2008). Sediment Supply. A healthy barrier island will be balanced in a dynamic equilibrium of erosion and deposition. Relative decreases in sediment supply can leave an island in a state of net sediment loss, resulting in decreasing size and possible drowning (Byrnes et al., 2013). The primarily quartz sand islands are supplied by beaches, riverine sources, and offshore sands to the east (Otvos and Giardino, 2004). Prevailing easterly winds drive long-shore transport in the region, moving sediment westward along the chain. This is reflected in the general east to west movement and migration of the islands (Byrnes et al., 2012). Despite the seemingly large subaqueous volume of sand supplied to the chain each year (305,000 m 3 ), there is still a net loss of sediment (Byrnes et al., 2013). In fact, Ship Island represents the segment with the largest sediment deficit in the chain at -174,000 m 3 per year averaged from 1917 to 2005 (Byrnes et al., 2013). This makes it difficult for the barrier to grow or recover after large erosive events, and contributes to the reason Ship Island has a relatively small volume above sea level for its length when compared with healthier Florida barriers (Twichell et al., 2013). More updrift erosion than downdrift deposition is occurring, along with island narrowing and segmentation (Morton, 2008). All MS-AL barriers are in a transgressive/erosional state with occasional progradational/depositional landforms such as spits. This transgression is primarily fueled by movement of sediment to the back barrier via storm overwash, or sediment removal to the deep Gulf of Mexico by storm waves (Otvos & Carter, 2013). Natural island healing after these events is driven by the fair-weather wave sediment supply. In these conditions, shore-parallel bars form in the near shore on the shallow platforms (Otvos & Carter, 2008). Sediment loss from the system can also be attributed to ship channel dredging (Morton, 2008;Otvos & Carter, 2008). Dredging removes approximately 120,000 m 3 /yr of sediment from the littoral zone (Byrnes et al., 2012). This decreases the natural longshore transport supply and deepens the channels from natural depths of around 4.5-5.7 meters to up to 20 m in the Gulfport Ship Channel directly west of Ship Island (Morton, 2008). This leaves sediments in the channels far below fair weather wave base, and functionally isolates one barrier from the next, as evidenced by the lack of sand transport between Ship and Cat Islands (Byrnes et al., 2013). Significant area loss is documented for all islands in the MS/AL chain, but Ship Island is the most vulnerable considering it is one of the farthest from the sand source and already shows more degradation than any other barrier in the chain (Byrnes et al., 2013)."}, {"section_title": "Study Goals", "text": "Island area trends suggest that Ship Island, along with the rest of the MS-AL barrier chain, is currently out of equilibrium and shrinking at unprecedented rates (Byrnes et al., 2013). Ship Island has experienced a 66% area loss between 1849 and 2005 (Otvos & Carter, 2008). However, a volumetric analysis has yet to be conducted for the combined topo/bathy system. The goals of this study are to quantify this disequilibrium in more detail by observing the short term barrier morphodynamics and provide the most high-resolution geomorphological and sedimentological analysis of the Ship Island system to date. This is accomplished by first examining the immediate response of Ship Island to the Hurricane Katrina impact and the natural recovery period that followed. From this, the relative role of storm conditions and fair weather processes on sediment transport are described and quantified. This analysis aims to shed light towards our understanding of natural barrier island evolution in our current regime of accelerated sealevel rise, frequent intense storm impacts, and limited sediment supply. This information not only informs us of the evolution of Ship Island, but similar barriers globally."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "LiDAR Data", "text": "LiDAR data were obtained from the Joint Airborne LiDAR Bathymetry Technical Center of Expertise (JALBTCX), located at the Stennis International Airport, MS.

The data were gridded within polygons drawn to contain only areas with topo/bathy points. The geographical extent of the data differs from year to year primarily because of water clarity, but also due to instrument limitations and flight line patterns. The geographically smallest dataset used in this study is for the year 2004, which is severely limited in its bathymetric coverage (Table 2). 2010 also contains limited bathymetric data. 2007 and 2012, however, have complete coverage of the shallows around the island, and reach depths up to ~10 m in the 2012 dataset ( Figure 2)."}, {"section_title": "Elevation (m)", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Frequency", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Digital Elevation Model Analysis", "text": "Analysis of these final DEM's included sediment volume and sediment volume change calculations, and the creation of difference grids using methodologies similar to Buijsman et al., 2003.

These changes can be quantified for the three time slices in the difference plots to provide rates of volume change and other valuable metrics (Buijsman et al., 2003). In 2004, Ship Island has the largest surface area and the smallest inlet relative to the other years. The narrow, low-lying, spit-like feature extending from East Ship Island towards West Ship Island, referred to here as the barrier neck, minimizes Camille Cut to only ~1 km wide (Otvos & Carter, 2008;Figure 6, 2004Figure 6, to 2007. Most of this neck exists at less than 1 m elevation (   The narrowing of the eastern tip of West Ship island is reflected in the profiles along transect B (Figure 8). The 2004 profile at this location shows a significantly higher elevation foredune ridge, the first shore-parallel dune ridge inland of the beach (McBride, et al., 2013). In the 2007 profile, the shoreline has stepped back 100 m, and the foredune 21 ridge has been reduced to approximately half the original elevation. In the and 2012 profiles along transect B, the shoreline continues to retreat ~40 meters between those two years, and the foredune elevation remains approximately the same (Table 3). An offshore bar at ~ 1 m depth is also visible in these final two profiles (Figure 8).    Retreat rates (meters per year) are plotted here for each transect (A-E). Data is shown in Table 3.

Island volume decreases drastically, similar to island area, from 2004 to 2007. It is reduced by 1.2x10 6 m 3 over this time slice, primarily due to the removal of the low-lying neck and nearshore material. From 2007 to 2010, the island increases its volume by 0.6x10 6 m 3 . The largest addition of volume in this time slice is back-barrier spit growth and in the old shipping channel (Figure 12). In the final time slice from 2010 to 2012, island volume is reduced  Bathymetry changes are observed within the largest data area covered by all four datasets ( Figure 13). Water volume increases by 4.1x10 6 m 3 from 2004 to 2007, indicating an overall deepening of the bathymetry around the island (Table 5). From 2007 to 2010, the water volume decreased by 1.3 x10 6 m 3 , indicating an overall shallowing. In the last time slice, 2010 to 2012, the water volume increases again, but by a small amount, 0.6 x10 6 m 3 . This trend of deepening via loss of subaqueous sediment, 27 shallowing due to deposition, and slight deepening again around the islands and in Camille Cut is very similar to the subaerial volume trends observed in the three time slices.

Volume to area ratios indicate the volume of sediment associated with each square meter of island area. Overall totals reveal the net loss of sediment in the subaerial and subaqueous portions of the island within the data area. The total sediment loss from 2004 to 2007 is 5.2 x10 6 m 3 (Table 6). Sediment volume increase from 2007 to 2010 is 1.9 x10 6 m 3 , and from 2010 to 2012, 0.7 x10 6 m 3 was lost from the observed system.

The flattening of the neck to below MHW level increases the width of the inlet by ~5 times. Inlet/channel width increases in response to storm events are documented in other locations along the MS/AL chain during Katrina (Fritz et al., 2007). Some of the material removed from the neck was deposited to the west into the former main channel of Camille Cut. Another channel emerged ~3 km east of the original (Figure 14). This new channel formed at the boundary where a wide platform existed to the east and to the west the back-barrier shoreface drops off relatively Fair-weather I Fair-weather II Storm quickly into the deep MS Sound (Figure 14). These subaqueous features are not captured in the LiDAR dataset for 2004, but are visible in satellite imagery from January 2005.  (Figure 8). Some inundation did occur on these stable portions as well, killing all remaining pine trees and forming a pond on East Ship (Otvos & Carter, 2008). On the eastern tip of West Ship Island, some sediment removed from the shoreface was redeposited in the back-barrier in a spit feature ( Figure 6). Wave refraction around the tip into the relatively protected back-barrier likely allowed for this (Ashton & Murray, 2006). This may have also occurred on East Ship, but that area is not within the 2004 data coverage. Similar back-barrier spits do appear on East Ship in later years. Not all of the sediment removed from the subaerial island, shallow platform, shorefaces, or the low-lying neck was redeposited in the shallow back-barrier or in Camille Cut. Between 2004 and 2007, the island lost nearly half of its subaerial volume (Table 6). The total topo/bathy system observed in this study lost a minimum of 5.3x10 6 m 3 over this period, ~1.5 times the subaerial island volume in 2004. Overwash processes mostly permanently removed a significant amount of sediment from the system. The geomorphological consequences of this sediment removal are visible in the 2007 DEM ( Figure 5). The extreme erosion and lack of natural recovery observed in the Ship Island system over this period is similar to the more advanced transgressive state of the Chandeleur Islands in Louisiana (Twichell et al., 2013)."}, {"section_title": "Fair-weather Period", "text": "Overwash processes in combination with the lack of new sediment delivery from the east, can explain why only 37% of the sediment volume lost during Katrina was restored before the system returned to a net negative sediment flux (Byrnes et al., 2012)."}, {"section_title": "32", "text": "The little natural recovery can be attributed to the availability of sediments within fair weather wave base in the shallow platform surrounding the island (Otvos & Carter, 2008). High fair-weather wave angle causes continued island step-back, particularly on the eastern island tips (Ashton & Murray, 2006;Morton, 2008). The back-barrier areas all experience deposition, at the expense of this nearshore erosion. Therefore, overwash processes were also slightly constructive along the relatively sheltered back-barrier. Some material removed from the nearshore remains on the southern side and is transported downdrift. Small depositional features appear parallel to the south-western shorefaces of both islands. One of these features appears as the offshore bar in the 2010 profile along transect A (Figure 8). A considerable amount of the total material eroded from the shoreface is also likely ending up in the old section of the Gulfport Harbor Navigation Channel that lies directly adjacent to the western tip of Ship Island. This same sediment source, along with erosion along the Gulf side of the eastern Camille Cut shallows, allows the East Ship neck to begin aggrading and extending again. The new morphology of Camille Cut reduces the velocity at which tidal currents pass through the inlet by increasing its cross-sectional area. As tidal inlets widen and deepen, tidal amplitude typically increases while phase decreases. This is associated with a decrease in frictional force coupled with an increase in celerity (Cai et al., 2012;Chernetsky et al., 2010;Jiang et al., 2012;Zhu et al., 2015). This allows for shoaling in the original western channel, which once accommodated all the water that moves through the cut. The east-to-west longshore currents in the area drives the motion of sediments in the cut, and pushes the channel closer to West Ship Island as it shallows (Figure 11). The newly dominant eastern channel may hinder East Ship Island's ability to naturally extend past this point in Camille Cut. Some of this eroded material that makes its way onto the subaerial portion of the island is reworked by wind, given these changes are only noted during fair-weather time slices. This suggests that aeolian processes are rebuilding the foredune ridges in a few locations along the islands. The 2010 profiles along transects A, B, D and E show an aggraded foredune ridge relative to 2007 (Figure 8, 9). The island increases in volume and area during this recovery phase, but only recovers a fraction of that lost ( Table 5). All of the recovered volume, and most of the recovered area, appears between 2007 and"}, {"section_title": "2010.", "text": "The final time slice, 2010 to 2012, shows a system no longer dominated by the storm impact or recovery, but dominated by limited sediment supply. Although still in a fair-weather period, the island is too starved of sediment to continue its recovery. Spit growth continues along the East Ship neck, but has essentially halted along the eastern tips of the islands. The shallows now show a net erosional signature, and nearshore erosion continues as before. The foredune ridge, and other subaerial portions of the island, begin to deflate as well at rates up to ~0.3 m/yr. As sediment sources around the island begin to reach depletion, less material is supplied to the subaerial island despite a relatively constant rate of aeolian removal."}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "Several morphological trends are evident across all three time slices. Nearshore erosion, shoreline retreat, and island rotation occur from 2004 to 2012. Both nearshore erosion and shoreline retreat reach their maximum rates during the period of storm impact, but they continue even into the fair-weather phase (Table 3). Both erosion and retreat are most severe along the eastern tips of the islands, causing the observed rotation. Transects B and E cross the eastern tips of West and East Ship Island, respectively (Figures 8, 9). This can be explained by the large incident wave angle, and a lack of sediment supplied by long-shore drift (Ashton & Murray, 2006). This causes increasing sediment loss from west to east, and consequent counter clockwise rotation of the eastern island tips (Morton, 2008). Ravinement. The island transects reveal how the island profiles respond to the Katrina impact. On centennial to millennial timescales, stormy and fair weather periods influence the equilibrium shoreface profile (Wallace et al., 2010). A pre-storm equilibrium profile is characterized by a steep upper shoreface. This adjusts to stormy periods by shallowing its slope in response to higher wave energy. The sediment removed from the upper shoreface in this process is pulled offshore to the lower shoreface ( Figure  16). Although this study examines changes on a year to year timescale, some of these adjustments are already visible. The upper shore face is the steepest in 2004 where the data is available. From 2004 to 2012 the profiles move towards the post-storm profile (Figures 8, 9). On this short timescale, the island continues to adjust to the Katrina impact, and has not yet reached the post-storm equilibrium profile. Barrier island recovery and adjustment is not always immediate, and islands can take years to fully equilibrate (Stone et al., 2004). Aerial and Volumetric Changes. The aerial extent of Ship Island has been measured many times since the 1800's, primarily by aerial imagery and later by satellite ( Figure 15). The overall trend is one of significant land loss from a total area of ~6 km 2 in the mid 1800's, when it was still unified, to a total area of only ~2 km 2 by 2005 (Byrnes et al., 1991;Otvos & Carter, 2013;Waller & Malbrough, 1976). Smaller-scale area changes can be observed before and after storm impacts, like Katrina. After 2005, the island area began to increase again (Otvos & Carter, 2013). This increase is verified by the data presented here ( Table 6). The overall storm response observed in this study is the response that can be expected by islands within a regime of sediment supply limitation (Priestas & Fagherazzi, 2010;Stone et al., 2004). Equilibrium profiles for stormy and fair-weather periods (modified from Wallace et al., 2010). Volume change studies conducted on larger temporal and spatial scales can also be compared to values presented here. Byrnes (2013) averages bathymetric changes from 1917/18 to 2005/10 to calculate an overall sediment flux for the entire barrier island chain. Values for each island and for sections of each island are also reported. Ship Island's average bathymetric flux over this time period is -174,000 m 3 /yr (Byrnes et al., 2013). The subaqueous sediment flux calculated in this study averaged from 2004 to 2012 is -430,000 m 3 /yr. When the subaerial sediment flux from this study is included, the value becomes -500,000 m 3 /yr from 2004 to 2012.

During the erosional period, a minimum of net sediment loss of 4.1x10 6 m 3 occurred.

Seagrass beds found in the Mississippi Sound lie exclusively on the north side of the barrier islands, and are typically patchy and discontinuous (Carter et al., 2011;Eleuterius, 1987). This has remained consistent since some of the first documented observations were made in the 1940's (Carter et al., 2011). Many species of shellfish, finfish, crabs, and shrimp present in the Mississippi Sound are known to rely on seagrass ecosystems (Handley et al., 2007). However, these important seagrass ecosystems in the Mississippi Sound, and globally, are in decline (Handley et al., 2007;Orth et al., 2006). In order to best facilitate their recovery in specific locations like Ship Island, Mississippi, the current extent and suitable physical environments for seagrass growth must be examined."}, {"section_title": "Seagrass Background", "text": "Most species of seagrass require shallow, low turbidity and low energy environments so they have sufficient light but are not affected by currents and heavy erosion or deposition (Eleuterius, 1987;Yates et al., 2011). In order for seagrass to colonize and grow, the substratum must be appropriate for rhizomes to establish and fasten. Areas with very mobile substrate conditions, like sediments within the surf zone or in an area of fast currents, are unsuitable (Iverson & Bittaker, 1986). Severe storm impacts can also influence seagrass distributions. The grasses can sometimes be buried or washed away by this type of energetic, episodic event (Eleuterius, 1987). Seagrass patches are capable of withstanding storm impacts if they are sufficiently protected, however (Byron & Heck, 2006;Carter et al., 2011). In some cases, the presence of seagrass can facilitate sediment deposition and stabilization by slowing bottom currents and fastening the sediments in their roots. This suggests that certain low depositional rates are tolerable for seagrass. Rapid placement of photosynthesis and kill the plants (Yates et al., 2011). H. wrightii is found growing in a variety of grain sizes from mud to sand (Iverson & Bittaker, 1986). In coastal Mississippi and Alabama, however, the species is typically found in sandy areas like those surrounding the barriers (Eleuterius, 1987). It has a shallow root system, and often appears early in the successional development of seagrass beds (Dawes, 1987). H. wrightii was found to withstand the most exposure during lowtide when compared with other seagrass species growing in Tampa Bay, and was also observed dominating both the deep water and shallow water fringes of multi-species seagrass beds, though its ideal habitat is closer to sea-level (Yates et al., 2011). Along the Mississippi barrier islands, this species of seagrass contributes biomass (~138 g dwt m -2 on average during optimum conditions) to nearshore environments which are otherwise relatively devoid of organic material (Eleuterius, 1987)."}, {"section_title": "Motivation", "text": "The stability of suitable habitat for submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) in the Mississippi Sound is directly related to barrier island stability (Carter et al., 2011;Eleuterius, 1987).

The early summer data from 2010 should reflect the beginning of the growing season, and therefore the minimum SAV coverage. The early fall data from 2014 should reflect the SAV maximum area (Carter et al., 2011). The 2010 areas are larger than the 2014 areas, particularly the West Ship polygon, however. The majority of the SAV polygons from 2010 and 2014 overlap, so both datasets show essentially the same habitable zones (Figure 17). Much of the variation between the 2010 and 2014 polygons may be explained by surveying methodology. SAV extent and patchiness was determined by eye (Barry A. Vittor & Associates, 2011;2015). All of the SAV areas around Ship Island were patchy, so by definition less than 50% of the polygon 43 area is actually seagrass area ( Figure 18).

The D90 values ranged from 94.4 to 803.5 \u03bcm, or very fine sand to coarse sand respectively.

Most difference values are approximately zero, indicating negligible bathymetric change. environment, making bottom conditions unsuitable for photosynthetic organisms like seagrass. The sediment on these shallow shelves is within the zone of active sediment transport, and exclusively sandy, reducing sediment-derived turbidity, and allowing better light penetration. This is primarily the reason the seagrass only appears in areas of fine sand and coarser. The seagrass itself is not limited by the grainsize of its bottom substrate (Iverson & Bittaker, 1986)."}, {"section_title": "50", "text": "Erosion/Deposition Patterns LiDAR datasets from 2004 to 2012 show that the backbarrier shallow platform zones, where the majority of seagrass patches exist, has not experienced rapid erosion or deposition over this period.

The highest energy fair-weather waves typically impact on the southern shore for this reason. This concentration of high energy is verified by the steeper southern shoreface observed in the bathymetry, and the presence of wide shallow platforms on the north side of the islands (Figure 20). Seagrass is unable to establish in zones regularly exposed to high-energy waves (Iverson & Bittaker, 1986). Protection from waves is important for seagrass growth and establishment, and loss of protective sand bars is shown to have a negative relationship with seagrass area (Fonseca et al., 2002). The formation of bars in the western Camille Cut channel formed a zone protected enough for seagrass to establish between the 2010 and 2012 surveys. This zone is deeper than the other seagrass patches at ~2 m, indicating that where there is sufficient protection and low turbidity, seagrass can grow in greater depths.

It grows in an area that is directly impacted by the prevailing wave direction from the southeast (Figure 17). Seagrass is unable to colonize this area. Algae and bryozoans, like those found in these surveys, do not necessarily negatively impact seagrass growth and habitat, but can block light in some instances of overgrowth (Huges et al., 2004)."}, {"section_title": "Projected Effectiveness of Camille Cut Restoration", "text": "Seagrass around Ship Island almost exclusively grows on the shallow platforms north of the islands. Restoring the central portion of the island may increase area suitable for seagrass growth, in addition to perhaps providing protection against inland storm surge effects. Management of coastal resources aimed at protecting citizens living along the coast is critical, and public policy and management decisions should reflect this (Dolan and Wallace, 2012). In the MS/AL barrier chain, the larger the island providing protection from waves, the larger the seagrass patches (Pham et al., 2014). Sandbars placed near Tampa Bay were found to be very affective at increasing seagrass habitat primarily when bars were emergent during some part of the tidal cycle (Fonseca et al., 2002). The effectiveness of a Camille Cut restoration for this purpose will depend on several factors. The physical stability of the infill is important for maintaining the protected zone behind the islands. This will depend upon the grainsize of the material used and the elevation to which it is built up. The current MsCIP restoration plan considers material with a D50\u2265280 \u03bcm sufficient for Camille Cut infill (USACE, 2011). Shore-face and Camille Cut grainsizes are D50>300 \u03bcm in most places. D90 values often reach above 700 \u00b5m, very coarse sand, indicating regular exposure to high-energy currents and waves, which the new fill would need to withstand. If the material used is unstable, or built to insufficient elevation, it may be vulnerable to overwash during storm events. Not only can this cause permanent breaches and instability in the island, even if a new inlet is not formed, washover deposits can cover existing seagrass beds along the backbarrier ( Figure   18). Material stability may be increased by placing material updrift along the coastline and allowing sediments to deposit naturally in the cut. This will prevent unstable grainsizes from depositing by allowing smaller grainsizes to naturally continue westward to a lower-energy location."}, {"section_title": "53", "text": "Steepness of the drop off behind Camille Cut may presents a problem, as the seagrass prefers the shallow environment (<2 m around Ship Island). Placing seagrass patches too close to the back barrier beach may leave them vulnerable to smothering by overwash. Construction of a wide back-barrier platform can provide enough area for seagrass to grow at a sufficient distance from the backshore to reduce the risk of washover. The shallow bathymetry of Camille Cut drops off steeply into the Mississippi Sound, in contrast with the shallow shelves that exist north of the main islands. Construction of a feature like this north of the restoration area will require enough sediment to fill the deep area north of Camille Cut. Once the proper environment for seagrass is established, the grass may begin to increase in area naturally. Seagrass beds were observed to recover at a rate of ~2 km 2 per year in Tampa Bay once management strategies were put in place (Yates et al., 2011). Seagrass coverage in the Tampa Bay area is on the order of 140 km 2 , however, so when scaled to the present seagrass coverage, recovery is only a little more than 1% per year. Ship Island currently only supports about 1.3 km 2 of seagrass coverage (Barry A. Vittor & Associates, 2015). This is the area of polygons drawn around patchy seagrass beds, indicating <50% of the polygon is actual seagrass. This inflated value can become problematic when estimating recovery rates and ecosystem health (Pham et al., 2014). Assuming this was solid seagrass coverage, and it recovers at the same rate as the seagrass observed in Tampa Bay, it would only gain ~0.02 km 2 per year. Natural seagrass bed recovery after loss is typically very slow, and the best approach is often planting (Byron & Heck, 2006;Yates et al., 2011). Nutrient addition via increasing bird perches or other methods will not be necessary as seagrasses require relatively low levels of 54 nutrients, and increased concentration is correlated with seagrass limitation due to epiphyte growth on the leaves (Hughes et al., 2004)."}, {"section_title": "IV.", "text": "Future studies of SAV growth should be conducted using survey methods that only include area within individual patches rather than large areas with <50% coverage. Digital image analysis methods similar to those employed by Carter et al., 2011 would provide more informative data that is also comparable with most other published datasets."}]
