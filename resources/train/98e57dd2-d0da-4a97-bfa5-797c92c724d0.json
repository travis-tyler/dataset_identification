[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "On 31 December 2019, the WHO China country office was informed of cases of pneumonia unknown etiology (unknown cause) detected in Wuhan city, Hubei province of China. On 3 January 2020, a total of 44 case-patients with pneumonia of unknown etiology were reported to WHO by the national authorities in China. On 7 January 2020, the Chinese authorities identified a new type of coronavirus. Then, it has quickly spread to become a global pandemic [1, 2] .\nOn 6 September 2020, after eight months, it was distributed to 215 countries and territories around the world. As of 6 September 2020 on 1:00 pm , 27,087,151 total cases of have been reported, including 884,110 total deaths with 3.3% of fatality rate and 19,208,336 total recovered with 70.9% recovered rate and also 6,994,705 active cases with 25.8% rate as Worldometers information provided globally. In Africa as this report showed that the total cases was 1,297,434 with 4.8% covered from the world, total deaths was 31,131 with 2.4% of fatality rate, total recovered was 1,033,859 with 79.7% of recovery rate, and active cases was 232,444 with 17.9% rate [3] [4] [5] . And, the current Worldometer information statistics were summarized clearly on table 1 below.\nAs of 1 September 2020, a cumulative total of 1,259, 817 COVID-19 cases were reported in the African region. In the region, there was a 3% total cases increment only in six days from September 1 to 6. And as of 6 September 2020, South Africa has registered more than 49% (636, 884), of all reported confirmed cases in the region. The other countries that have reported large numbers of cases were Egypt 7.7 % (99,712), Morocco 5.4% (70,160), Ethiopia 4.4% (57,466), Nigeria 4.2% (54,905), Algeria 3.6% (46,071), Ghana 3.5% (44,777), Kenya 2.7% (35, 020), Cameroon 1.5% (19, 604) and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire 1.4% (18, 472) . These top 10 infected countries collectively have accounted 83.5% (1,083,071) of all reported cases in African region [3] [4] [5] .\nAnd as of 6 September 2020, the Worldometer updated information and the summarized table below have also shown that Egypt had recorded the highest fatality rate (5.5% with 5,511 deaths) in Africa. And the next 9 countries that have the highest fatality rates were Algeria (3.4% with 1,549 deaths), South Africa (2.3% with 14,779 deaths), Cameroon (2.1% with 415 deaths), Morocco and Nigeria have equal rates (1.9% with 1,329 and 1,054 deaths, respectively), Kenya .

These highest rates may indicate that the countries have well protected and have taken strong measures on the virus, but still needs more efforts to control the pandemic in the next long and short times. But, the two East African countries Kenya and Ethiopia have the lowest recovered rates as compared with the others. And, currently the two countries have the highest active cases rates with 37.9% and 62.3%, respectively and the virus is increasing alarmingly as compared with other countries.\nAnd, they need strong interventions and treatment centers/hospitals, especially Ethiopia will be open more health facility centers since she has the lowest hospital beds per thousand (0.3) as Who reports showed. And as Who African region report, Ethiopia requires more tests and test reagents in order to intensify implementation of the new strategy for COVID-19 response because of the increase in cases in the country [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] .\nThis study will be a guide in what direction the existing healthcare services should increase the countries' capacities in the coming days in the face of the expected number of COVID-19 new cases. The epidemic's rapid spreading reveals the necessity of doing what should be done immediately and by taking the right steps.\nThis study was designed to give communities and also the government a sense of how fast this pandemic is progressing and to inform them of necessary precautions. For this purpose, the number of COVID-19 new cases data of the top 10 infected African countries (South Africa, Egypt, Morocco, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Algeria, Ghana, Kenya, Cameroon, and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire) has been modeled and forecasted using the curve estimation regression models and time series models from February 14 and September 6, 2020 in this study. The start date of the virus varies in countries, and thus the models are evaluated and installed separately for each country. The predictions show how the course of the epidemic new cases will be in the following days, taking .

And, the main motivation of the study was to model the COVID-19 new cases which increase cubically and exponentially in a short time according to the health and social policies of the countries. As a result of modeling, different times dependent policies can be developed based on the estimated and forecasted curves of COVID-19 new cases will be increased, decreased or constantan for the next days. These fitted models will be guiding both in health and social terms. And, these specified models to be published early; they will be a very serious guide for policymakers in the countries. .

The time series modeling is to carefully collect and rigorously study the past observations of a time series to develop an appropriate model which describes the inherent structure of the series.\nThe series enables to improve a proper model and to make prospective estimations by using statistical methods. However, stationary series are required for estimating the values which they will take prospectively by using the past values for any series. Since non-stationary series contain up-and-down values exhibiting variance at high level, margin of error in the possible estimates is quite high. Stationary may be defined as a probabilistic process whose average and variance do not vary over time and covariance between two periods is based on distance between two periods, not period for which this covariance is calculated methods are used for searching the stationary.

In ARIMA models, a non-stationary time series is made stationary by applying finite differencing of the data points. The ARIMA models include the most suitable but limited parameter among the various model options, depending on the nature of the considering data. ARIMA (p,d,q) models are obtained by taking the difference of series from d degree and adding to ARMA (p, q) model for the stabilizing process. In the ARIMA (p,d,q) models, p is the degree of the Autoregressive (AR) model, q is the degree of the moving average (MA) model and d stands how many differences are required to make the series stationary.
