[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract: Safety laws are among the most successful means of reducing injuries, but their effectiveness is strongly influenced by the level of enforcement. To characterize enforcement of off-road vehicle (ORV) laws statewide, analyses of citations were performed using Iowa Court Information System data. From 2005-2015, 5173 individuals were charged with 5643 citations issued. Citations averaged <5/county/year, decreased dramatically over time, and varied by county when normalized to registered all-terrain vehicles (ATVs). Over 90% of operators cited were male and Caucasian. One-fifth were <18 years old. The top five violations were: operation on a highway/snowmobile trail (51%), registration/identification number not documented/displayed (19%), prohibited use in a park/preserve (5.5%), and operation with more persons than the vehicle is designed to carry (4.4%). The Department of Natural Resources issued the highest percentage of citations, followed in decreasing order by Sheriff, Police, State Patrol, and Conservation officers. Significant differences were identified when citations were compared by sex, age, race, enforcement agency, disposition (guilty vs. not guilty), and when comparing counties with or without an ORV park. These characteristics suggest limited and variable enforcement of laws statewide that may reduce their potential to prevent deaths and injuries, and that improved strategies to support ORV law enforcement are needed."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Crashes of off-road vehicles (ORVs), specifically all-terrain vehicles (ATVs) and recreational off-highway vehicles (ROVs), are a serious public health and safety concern and a continuing source of deaths and injuries [1, 2] . To address safety concerns, many states have passed ORV-related legislation. However, laws vary considerably from state to state [3] , and no states have comprehensive laws that address all major risk factors. Risk factors for ORV-related crashes and injuries include younger age, being male, driving on roads, lack of helmet use, speed, riding at night, lack of training, operating under the influence of drugs or alcohol, age-inappropriate vehicle size, carrying passengers on ATVs and not wearing seat belts in ROVs [2, [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] .\nOverall, traffic safety legislation has been shown to effectively decrease deaths and injuries, and enforcement appears to play an important role in achieving these goals. For example, primary and enhanced enforcement of motor vehicle seatbelt laws have resulted in increased seatbelt use and reduced traffic fatalities [18, 19] . Similarly, statewide universal motorcycle helmet laws have been shown to be highly effective for increasing helmet use and decreasing brain injury [20, 21] . On the other hand, youth-only helmet laws have been found to be considerably less effective [22] , most likely due to the significant difficulties enforcing a law covering only a small percentage of riders.\nWhile safety legislation has been well studied with regards to motorcycles, automobiles, and other roadway vehicles, only a few studies have focused on ORVs. Of these, some showed positive effects on riding behavior [23] [24] [25] , whereas others suggested little benefit [26, 27] . However, none of these studies addressed law enforcement, and in studies with limited effects, authors speculated that the most likely reason was lack of enforcement [28] . One study provided indirect support for the hypothesis that enforcement promotes ATV safety [29] . In this publication, safer riding behaviors were observed among crash victims in environments with stronger enforcement, i.e., off-highway vehicle (OHV) parks, as compared to other off-road locations.\nThe objective of this study was to better understand how law enforcement officers addressed violations of ORV laws statewide. Of particular interest was determining the level of enforcement of laws that promote safer riding such as staying off public roads, no passengers, and wearing a helmet (required in state OHV parks)."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study Design", "text": "A retrospective secondary analysis of ATV and ROV related citations issued from 2005 to 2015 was performed using data from the Judicial Branch's Iowa Courts Information System (ICIS).

Approximately 1% of citations were for operating while intoxicated and none were for failing to wear a helmet in OHV parks where they are required.

Citations for roadway riding were much less common in counties with parks than in those without.

Safety laws are designed to reduce crashes and injuries by focusing on risk factors, and Iowa's ORV laws and OHV park regulations do address some of these issues. However, our study suggests limited statewide enforcement of existing ORV laws/regulations and found that overall, the number of citations decreased dramatically over the study period. In fact, citations dropped from an overall average of 8.6 citations per county in 2004 to only 4.0 citations per county in 2015. The number of citations per county as a function of registered ATVs also varied significantly, suggesting county-dependent differences in enforcement levels."}, {"section_title": "Riding on Public Roads", "text": "Roadway riding is among the most significant risk factors for serious injury and death [9] [10] [11] [12] . This is because ATVs and ROVs are specifically designed for off-road use only. Features including a relatively high center of gravity, low-pressure off-road tires, and a locked rear differential or solid rear axle can increase the risk of losing control and/or having a rollover on roadways [9] [10] [11] [12] . Iowa state law prohibits riding on public roadways unless using the vehicle under specified conditions for occupational purposes.\nWe found that around 50% of all citations were given for riding on public roads, but the number of charges were never more than 4 citations/county/year and decreased 70% over time. The observations that more than half of all fatalities and approximately one-third of injuries involving ATVs have occurred on Iowa's roads [9, 11] , along with survey studies of Iowa ATV riders [40, 41] , support the hypothesis that riding on roads is common across the state. Thus, lack of roadway riding is unlikely to fully account for the small number of citations. We can only speculate about the reasons for the observed decrease in citations related to roadway use. One contributor may be the fact that since 2011, a number of Iowa counties have passed ordinances opening at least some of their public roads to ORV transportation and recreational use."}, {"section_title": "Carrying Passengers", "text": "Passengers or operators with passengers are a significant proportion of crash victims, and roadway ATV-related fatalities are more likely to involve passengers than fatalities occurring off-road [9] [10] [11] [12] 42] . Almost all ATVs are designed for an operator only and passengers are an independent risk factor for ATV-related crashes and injuries [9, 11, 32] . Iowa statute prohibits multiple riders on single-person ATVs, and this applies to both public and private lands. Counties and cities cannot override this prohibition.\nPassenger-related citations ranged from 14 to 30 per year for the entire state. Of note, a study of over 4500 Iowa school-aged children (11-16 years old) found that of the approximately 80% that reported having been on an ATV, 91% had ridden with or as a passenger [40] . Similarly, survey studies of attendees at the Iowa-Illinois Farm Progress Show found that more than 80% of respondents had ridden with or as a passenger on an ATV [41] . These data suggest that riding with passengers is common in the state, and that again, lack of this riding behavior is unlikely to explain the small number of citations."}, {"section_title": "Alcohol", "text": "Another major risk factor for crashes and injuries is alcohol intoxication, and state law prohibits operating ORVs while under the influence of alcohol or drugs. A previous study using national data showed alcohol use by 39% of fatality victims, and a study using Iowa data found over 30% of non-fatal crashes involved alcohol use [11] . These and other studies suggest alcohol use is common among ATV riders, yet <1% of citations were given for operating an ORV while intoxicated. It is currently unclear why this discrepancy exists, and further study will be needed to address this very significant question."}, {"section_title": "Helmet Use", "text": "Head injuries are among the leading causes of death and disability from ATV crashes [43] , and helmets have been shown to significantly reduce the likelihood of these injuries [9, 12] . There are no general helmet laws in Iowa for ORVs or other vehicles. Iowa is one of only three states where this is true. However, Iowa's OHV parks do require helmets for all park riders. Despite this, no citations were given for lack of helmet use by the DNR, the agency that primarily enforces park regulations."}, {"section_title": "ORV Laws and Injury Prevention", "text": "The most effective means of injury prevention are evidence-based safety laws and their enforcement. For ORVs, injury prevention laws are often limited and vary by state [3] . Advocacy for more laws is critically needed. In Iowa, some of the key ORV laws needed are those requiring specific training and licensing, seat belt (ROV) and helmet use, an evidenced-based minimum age for vehicle operation, and laws prohibiting youth operation of adult-size ATVs. Repeal of ordinances expanding roadway access would also be essential.\nHowever, both existing and future laws will have limited effectiveness in injury prevention if enforcement is lacking. We can only speculate as to why there were relatively few ORV citations issued in the state over 11 years, why citation rates varied considerable by county, and why the total number decreased over time. Possible contributors to all of these may include limited knowledge about existing ORV laws among riders and among officers in some agencies. Another known challenge is the inability of enforcement officers in roadway vehicles to stop ORVs when their operators choose to flee by going off the road. Enforcement agencies often have policies that discourage vehicle chases, which could increase the risk of an ORV crash.\nReduced resources may also be contributing to less enforcement. In 2005, the jurisdiction of DNR officers became more limited, and this may explain at least in part the marked decrease in citations from 2005 to 2006. We have recently learned that state budget cuts will mean no part-time summer DNR officers, which will likely further reduce enforcement of OHV park regulations. These parks were previously an example of how effective enforcement can positively impact safety behavior [29] . In the context of limited resources, officers' attitudes about the priority of enforcing ORV laws may also be important and remain unknown.\nORV safety education efforts are ongoing in many states and other countries but need to be expanded to legislators and enforcement officers. This education needs to include information on why laws and their enforcement are essential for injury prevention. Additionally, advocacy groups need to partner with other stakeholders to identify more effective strategies and more resources for enforcing ORV laws. Finally, additional studies are needed regarding enforcement of ORV laws, as are expanded efforts for standardizing these laws across states to optimize their impact."}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "The current study is limited by its retrospective nature. Furthermore, the data analyzes enforcement and legislation specific to the state of Iowa and may not be generalizable to other jurisdictions. The source of data only covered physical citations that were recorded by police officers and did not include warnings. Therefore, the data are likely an underrepresentation of the actual number of individuals who were stopped for engaging in unsafe riding behaviors, as well as the extent to which the laws were being enforced. Although mapping data were normalized to registered ATVs, we cannot rule out the possibility that the variability observed between counties was due, at least in part, to riding extent (riding hours/ATV), ratio of registered versus unregistered ATVs, and/or the extent to which illegal riding behaviors occurred. However, there was an approximate 100-fold variation in citation rates, and it seems unlikely that that level of variability was exclusively due to differences in ORV operator riding behaviors or registered versus unregistered ATVs."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "This study shows relatively limited enforcement of ORV laws and regulations in the state, with less than five citations per county per year issued during the study period. Data also demonstrated a significant decrease in citations issued over time and suggest there may be differences in the level of enforcement by county. We hypothesize that these characteristics may be reducing the effectiveness of existing laws and their potential to prevent deaths and injuries. Further study is needed to determine law enforcement officer's attitudes regarding the importance ORV law enforcement, and the barriers they encounter in successfully enforcing ORV laws. Our findings suggest a need for further education about laws and their enforcement, and for better enforcement-based strategies for ORV injury prevention.\nAuthor Contributions: E.S.Q. was primarily responsible for organizing the data, performing initial analysis, and creating the first draft of tables, figures, and the manuscript.
