Sex differences in callosal organization and diffusion characteristics have also not been evaluated fully in ASD.\nMethods: Structural and diffusion-weighted images were acquired in 139 preschool-aged children with ASD (112 males/27 females) and 82 typically developing (TD) controls (53 males/29 females). Longitudinal scanning at two additional annual time points was carried out in a subset of these participants. Callosal organization was evaluated using two approaches: 1) diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography to define subregions based on cortical projection zones and 2) as a comparison to previous studies, midsagittal area analysis using Witelson subdivisions. Diffusion measures of callosal fibers were also evaluated. Results: Analyses of cortical projection zone subregions revealed sex differences in the patterns of altered callosal organization. Relative to their sex-specific TD counterparts, both males and females with ASD had smaller regions dedicated to fibers projecting to superior frontal cortex, but patterns differed in callosal subregions projecting to other parts of frontal cortex. While males with ASD had a smaller callosal region dedicated to the orbitofrontal cortex, females with ASD had a smaller callosal region dedicated to the anterior frontal cortex. There were also sex differences in diffusion properties of callosal fibers. While no alterations were observed in males with ASD relative to TD males, mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD) were all increased in females with ASD relative to TD females. Analyses of Witelson subdivisions revealed a decrease in midsagittal area of the corpus callosum in both males and females with ASD but no regional differences in specific subdivisions.

The corpus callosum is the largest fiber bundle in the brain and consists of well-organized neocortical commissural connections [3] . In older children, adolescents and adults with ASD, the corpus callosum is consistently reported to be smaller, with decreased fractional anisotropy [4] and reduced interhemispheric functional connectivity [5] . Fewer studies, however, have evaluated callosal deficits in young children with ASD [6] [7] [8] , and very little is known about sex differences in the corpus callosum in ASD [9] . We sought to evaluate the corpus callosum in preschool-aged children with ASD and to determine whether there are differences in callosal organization between males and females with ASD.\nASD is much more common in males than females [10, 11] , and females remain underrepresented in research studies. Consequently, little is known about the neuropathology of ASD in females and whether sex differences exist. Emerging evidence suggests that females with ASD have a different neuroanatomical profile than males [12] [13] [14] [15] , including in the corpus callosum [9, 13] . We sought to extend these findings in our relatively large cohort of preschoolaged children. We conducted a longitudinal study of the development of the corpus callosum in children with ASD from 3 to 5 years of age using structural and diffusionweighted imaging. The cohort includes 139 children with ASD (112 males/27 females) and 82 typically developing (TD) control children (53 males/29 females) enrolled in the Autism Phenome Project.\nCallosal axons carry information between many different parts of the neocortex. Bundles of callosal axons that project to different regions of the cortex are fairly large and can be identified and measured using modern diffusionweighted imaging and tractography in individual subjects [16, 17] . Using these methods, we segmented the corpus callosum based on cortical projection zones and examined the diffusion properties of the axon bundles that innervate specific cortical regions [17] . As a comparison to previous studies, we also evaluated the midsagittal area of the corpus callosum using standard Witelson subdivisions [18] ."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "Participants were enrolled in the University of California (UC) Davis MIND Institute Autism Phenome Project.

Inclusion criteria for ASD were taken from the diagnostic definition of ASD in young children formulated and agreed upon by the Collaborative Programs of Excellence in Autism (CPEA) using DSM-IV criteria. Participants met ADOS cutoff scores for either autism or ASD. In addition, they exceeded the ADI-R cutoff score for autism on either the Social or Communication subscale and within two points of this criterion on the other subscale. An ADOS severity score was calculated ranging from 1 to 10 [23] , which allows comparison of autism severity across participants tested with different ADOS-G modules. Overall developmental quotients (DQ) were determined for all participants using the Mullen Scales of Early Development (MSEL) [24] .\nTypically developing children were screened and excluded for ASD using the Social Communication Questionnaire [25] .

Images were obtained using a three-dimensional T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition gradient-echo (MPRAGE) sequence (TR 2,170 ms; TE 4.86 ms; matrix 256 \u00d7 256; 192 slices in the sagittal direction; 1.0-mm isotropic voxels) and a diffusion-weighted, spin echo, echo planar imaging sequence ('ep2d_diff '; number of slices: 72; slice thickness: 1.9 mm; slice gap: 0.0; matrix size: 128 \u00d7 128; voxel size: 1.9-mm isotropic; phaseencoding direction: anterior to posterior (A>>P); TR: 11,500; TE: 91; scan time: 6 min and 29 s), with an effective b-value of 700 mm 2 /s, 30 gradient directions, and five interleaved b = 0 images. Thirty-six children (24 ASD [22 males/2 females], 12 TD [10 males/2 females]) were excluded from the study due to waking up prior to the completion of the diffusion sequence.\nTo accomplish longitudinal imaging at three time points, scans were acquired from October 2007 to October 2012. In August 2009, the Siemens 3T Trio MRI system was upgraded to a Trio Total Imaging Matrix (TIM) MRI System running version VB15A operating system software. All the VA25A sequences were upgraded and mapped to their corresponding VB15A sequences.\nFor T1-weighted scans, changes in hardware and software over this scanning period were controlled for using a calibration phantom (ADNI MAGPHAM, The Phantom Laboratory, Salem, NY, USA, http://www.phantomlab.com) scanned at the end of each MRI session. Distortion correction was then carried out on each participant's MPRAGE image (Image Owl, Inc., Greenwich, NY, USA, http://www. imageowl.com/) [19] . This step ensures accuracy in measurements of the midsagittal area of the corpus callosum and total cerebral volume by removing any distortion associated with changes in scanner hardware over time.\nFor the diffusion-weighted sequence, the spatial resolution, b-value, and gradient directions were preserved following the MRI system upgrade. While the diffusionweighted parameters were not directly changed, there may be differences in diffusion-weighted measures in regions with reduced geometric distortion. To control for these differences, we include MRI system upgrade status (pre-upgrade vs. post-upgrade) as a nuisance covariate for all statistical analyses involving diffusion tractography or diffusion-weighted measures.\nIn addition, we evaluated the proportion of participants (by diagnosis and sex) scanned pre-vs. ]) scans were acquired. Importantly, there were no differences across scanner upgrade status for diagnostic group (chi-square = 1.6, P = 0.21) or sex (chi-square = 0.01, P = 0.91).

Fiber tracts in the left and right hemisphere were then estimated separately using a deterministic streamlined tracking algorithm [29] [30] [31] with a fourth-order Runge-Kutta path integration method.\nStep size was fixed at 1 mm and path tracing proceeded using a fractional anisotropy (FA) threshold of 0.15 and a path angle threshold of 30\u00b0. The subset of fibers in each hemisphere intersecting the corpus callosum ROI was identified ( Figure 1A ). Using these sets of fibers, the callosum was segmented for each hemisphere separately according to the fiber projection zone using the method introduced by Huang et al. [17] . In brief, fibers were visualized using Quench (http://white.stanford.edu/newlm/index.php/ QUENCH), and a series of planes were used to define anatomical targets of the callosal fibers [16] . A total of 397 scans from 221 participants were analyzed. Five trained raters manually segmented the callosal fibers. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were calculated for each fiber region and ranged from 0.80 to 0.99. Mean ICCs for the left and right hemispheres were 0.96 and 0.93. In addition, a single expert rater (CWN) reviewed and edited segmentations for all 794 hemispheres. Defined projection zones included orbitofrontal, anterior frontal, lateral frontal, superior frontal, superior parietal, posterior parietal, occipital, and temporal regions (see Figure 1A , B,C). The cross-sectional area of each cortical projection zone fiber subdivision was determined on the midsagittal plane ( Figure 1D ). To evaluate diffusion properties, fibers from the right and left hemispheres were merged and cropped to the high coherence zone of 1 cm within the midsagittal plane ( Figure 1E ). Mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity (RD), axial diffusivity (AD), and FA were measured for each fiber subdivision. In brief, AD describes diffusion parallel to the principle diffusion direction (that is, along the long axis of an axonal bundle), and RD describes diffusion perpendicular to the principle diffusion direction. MD describes the average total diffusion, and FA is a scalar value of the normalized standard deviation of the three diffusion directions."}, {"section_title": "Corpus callosum midsagittal area and Witelson subdivisions", "text": "Distortion-corrected T1-weighted images were preprocessed to remove non-brain tissue and to correct for field inhomogeneity [32] .

The models are flexible and allow children to have different numbers of scans and different lag times between the scans. This approach allowed us to treat subregion/subdivision as a repeated effect within the mixed-effect models for the corpus callosum. The core model used for the cortical projection zone subregions had fixed effects for subregion (orbital, anterior frontal, lateral frontal, superior frontal, superior parietal, posterior parietal, temporal, occipital), diagnosis, sex, upgrade status (pre-or post-upgrade), age, and TCV. Both age and TCV were centered at the time 1 averages for the TD control subjects. In this way, the intercept in the model can be interpreted as the average occipital subregion area (the reference region) for a TD female with average age and TCV at time 1. Individuals were permitted to have differing overall and subregion sizes, by including random effects for intercept and subregions that were assumed to follow a multivariate normal distribution. We allowed the variance of the residuals to differ across cortical projection zone subregions.\nThis core model allowed us to describe the overall pattern of differences across regions, diagnosis, and sex and assess maturation (age) effects. We then built a hierarchy of questions by adding and testing all two-way interactions between age, subregion/subdivision, sex, and diagnosis in the model. This allowed us to assess whether the maturation effects differed by subregion, sex, or diagnosis, whether the pattern of regional differences differed by sex or diagnosis, and whether there was a sex by diagnosis interaction. These interactions were not retained in the final model when they failed to add significantly to the model. Higher-order threeway or four-way interaction effects were likewise tested against simpler models including all relevant significant lower-order interaction effects. Any significant interaction effects including diagnosis by sex were further examined for a subset of specific simple comparisons of interest involving simple comparisons of diagnosis within levels of sex (males: ASD vs. TD, females: ASD vs. TD) and simple comparisons of sex within levels of diagnosis (ASD: males vs. females, TD: males vs. females). As such, alpha levels were not adjusted for such simple effect testing given the limited number of comparisons that were considered of interest a priori.\nSimilar mixed-effect models were used to model diffusion-weighted measures (FA, MD, RD, and AD) \nSecondary analyses examined whether the results of the primary analyses could be accounted for by baseline DQ.

We examined callosal size and organization of fibers projecting to cortical targets. We also evaluated diffusion characteristics of callosal fibers. Overall, the results suggest sex differences in the pattern of alterations in the corpus callosum of preschool-aged children with ASD. Specifically, the organization of callosal fibers projecting to the frontal lobe was different in males and females with ASD relative to their typically developing counterparts. While both males and females with ASD had smaller regions of the corpus callosum with fibers directed to superior frontal cortex, only males with ASD had a smaller region with fibers directed to the orbitofrontal cortex. In contrast, females with ASD had a smaller region of the corpus callosum associated with the anterior frontal cortex. We also observed that diffusion measures were more altered in females with ASD than males with ASD. While females with ASD exhibited increases in AD, RD, and MD relative to TD females, males with ASD did not differ from TD males on any diffusion measures. The alterations in diffusion measures observed in females with ASD could reflect changes in axonal membrane integrity, delayed or decreased myelination, or increased intracellular space with fewer and/or thinner axons [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] .\nAs a comparison to previous studies, we also conducted analyses of the midsagittal area of the corpus callosum using Witelson subdivisions. Although we did not observe any differences in the size of individual subdivisions between either males or females with ASD and their TD counterparts, we did observe an overall reduction in midsagittal area in both males and females with ASD, which is consistent with one other study in 3-to 4-year-old children [4] .\nThe longitudinal nature of this study allowed us to evaluate the development of the corpus callosum between 3 and 5 years of age. However, we did not detect any differences in the rate of growth of the corpus callosum or change in diffusion measures between ASD and TD children. This suggests that the observed differences in corpus callosum size, fiber organization, and microstructure in ASD were established prior to 3 years of age. A recent prospective study of the development of white matter tracts in infants who later develop autism suggests that aberrations in the trajectory of white matter development in ASD may occur as early as the first year of life [41] .\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study of young children with ASD to evaluate subregions of the corpus callosum based on anatomically defined cortical projection zones. Subdividing the corpus callosum using the Witelson protocol has yielded somewhat inconsistent results, which may be due, in part, to the limited anatomical specificity in Witelson subdivisions and individual variability in callosal organization. Figure 4 depicts examples of the two methods of evaluating callosal organization. There is considerable variability in the cortical projection zone pattern that is not captured by Witelson subdivisions. Arguably, analysis based on the pattern of projections to distinct cortical regions is more sensitive to disorders that are highly associated with frontal lobe function. It should be noted, however, that diffusion tractography has some inherent limitations, including the inability to resolve white matter tracts that are crossing (for Parameter estimates and standard errors are from the mixed-effects models assessing the relationship of diagnostic group, age, cortical projection zone subregions, and sex with diffusion measures. The reported models included fixed effects for scanner upgrade, diagnosis, sex, age, subregion, and the interactions between diagnosis and sex and between age and subregion. Random effects for person and region were included to account for the repeated measures. Models also included and tested other two-way interactions, but none were significant and were not retained in the reported model.\nexample, lateral projections of the callosum that intersect with corona radiata). Nevertheless, there is overlap between our results and previous studies that have utilized Witelson subdivisions. In their meta-analysis of older individuals with ASD, Frazier and Hardan report that the most impacted portion of the corpus callosum in ASD is the rostral body and that differences generally decrease in the more caudal subdivisions [4] , and in a study of 3 to 4 years old, the greatest changes were observed in the rostrum and rostral body [7] . The results from the present study generally support these findings. Although we did not observe differences based on analyses of Witelson subdivisions, we did observe differences in both males and females with ASD in callosal regions that contain fibers that project to frontal lobe regions, which correspond to the more rostral Witelson subdivisions.\nIn general, DTI studies of the corpus callosum in older individuals with ASD report decreased FA and increased MD, which appears to be driven by increases in radial rather than axial diffusivity [42] . However, in two studies of 1.8-to 3.3-year-old and 1.5-to 5.8-year-old children with ASD, Ben Bashat and colleagues found increased FA in the corpus callosum [6, 8] . This has been interpreted as an indication of precocious development of white matter associated with the neocortex. In our study of 3 to 5 years old, we did not observe any differences in FA in either males or females with ASD, but we did observe increased MD, RD, and AD in females, but not males with ASD. Several factors may contribute to these seemingly discrepant results. Importantly, the age range in the previous studies is younger than in the current sample, including toddlers as young as 1.5 years old. It is also not clear whether the previous studies included mixed-sex samples. The recent prospective study by Wolff and colleagues suggests that FA is higher in children with ASD around 6 to 12 months of age but then is lower in toddlers at 2 years of age [41] . Thus, the aforementioned DTI studies reporting increases in FA in young children with ASD may be capturing the earlier part of that developmental trajectory, while our study emphasizes the latter part. Additional prospective longitudinal studies that span infancy to early childhood are needed.\nIn typical development, the size of the corpus callosum does not appear to be sexually dimorphic [43] [44] [45] [46] , and our current results are consistent with this finding; there were no differences in callosal size between typically developing males and females after adjusting for total brain volume. In contrast, we did observe sex differences in the pattern of callosal alterations between males and females with ASD relative to their typically developing counterparts. Autism is much more common in boys than in girls, and although this disparate sex ratio is among the most highly replicated findings in studies of ASD [10, 11] , sex differences in ASD neuropathology remain poorly understood. Historically, females with ASD have been underrepresented in research studies due to the strong male bias of ASD.\nIt has long been theorized that a multifactorial liability model may explain the sex bias in ASD [47] [48] [49] . This model suggests that there are multiple genetic and environmental factors (that is, etiologic load) that contribute to an individual's liability for ASD and that the threshold is shifted in females such that a higher etiologic load is needed for females to meet criteria for ASD (the so-called 'female protective effect'). There is some preliminary evidence that preschool-aged females with ASD show a different and perhaps more extreme pattern of neural abnormalities in the amygdala, temporal lobe, and cerebellum [12, 50] . But many previous studies of the corpus callosum have either included only males [51, 52] or very small samples of females [7, 53] . There is some evidence for sex differences in the corpus callosum in adults with ASD [9, 13] , but additional studies are needed. Our sample size of 27 females with ASD is among the larger sample sizes in the MRI Although there is some overlap between the two parcellation methods, there is also a high degree of variability, particularly in the cortical projection zone segmentation. Using cortical projection zones provides a finer-grained anatomic parcellation of the corpus callosum.\nliterature of ASD, and our results provide a striking example of sex differences in the neuropathology of ASD. However, the functional consequence of the different patterns of callosal organization in males and females with ASD remains unclear. The orbitofrontal cortex is involved in emotional processing and decision-making for rewardrelated processes [54] . The anterior frontal cortex, comprised of the frontal pole and rostral portions of the superior and middle frontal gyri, is involved in higher-order executive function and cognitive processes [55] . Both regions have been implicated in the neuropathology of autism [56] [57] [58] , but sex-specific differences in the organization of the frontal lobe have not yet been explored. One possibility is that alterations in orbitofrontal interhemispheric connectivity in boys with ASD may lead to greater affective disturbances and a lower liability threshold for ASD (that is, easier detectability). In contrast, altered anterior frontal interhemispheric connectivity in females with ASD may manifest as higher-level cognitive disturbances that contribute to the 'female protective effect' and a higher liability threshold, making ASD more difficult to detect. Additional studies are under way to relate these findings to the behavioral manifestations of ASD. Future studies are also needed to determine whether these sex differences in the pattern of callosal organization persist as the child matures."}]
