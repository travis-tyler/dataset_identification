In a sense, salt marshes act as coastal floodplains that store water and serve as depositional zones for marine and terrestrial sediments. Salt marshes are also highly productive with a net primary production that ranges from 650 to 3700g dry biomass m -2 yr -1 (Teal, 1962;Williams and Murdock, 1966;Odum and de la Cruz, 1967) and are, therefore, an important nursery habitat for economically important fisheries (Cain and Dean, 1976;Weinstein, 1979;Wenner and Beatty, 1993;Lipcius et al., 2005). Furthermore, salt marshes help protect terrestrial lowlands from erosive tide and wave energy (Moller et al., 1999;Allen, 2000). All of the benefits of intertidal ecosystems are sustained by the interactions between physical and biological processes which operate within the context of an evolving salt marsh landscape. When conducting field work in an inundated salt marsh one can observe suspended and floating material in transit, and this material can change speed and direction several times in a matter of minutes, and without the aid of wind. Here, I refer to the high temporal and spatial variability in overmarsh currents as \"complexity\". Understanding the controls and scales of current complexity in salt marshes or tide influenced wetlands is important because in many cases it may strongly influence the distribution of suspended and dissolved nutrients (Valiela et al., 1978), larva distribution (Knieb, 1984), and contaminant dispersal (Nixon, 1980;. Field and numerical studies indicate that the primary controls on salt marsh circulation and associated material redistribution include vegetation drag (Leonard and Luther, 1995;Christansen et al., 2000;Leonard and Reed, 2002;) and topography (French and Stoddart, 1992;Lawrence et al., 2004;Torres and Styles, 2007;Chen and Torres, 2012). However, the detailed bathymetry or high resolution DEMs necessary for assessing the role of very subtle relief of salt marshes on overmarsh circulation typically are not present, and consequently the role of topography could not be fully evaluated. For example,  used numerical simulations on a 0.05km 2 salt marsh catchment to assess the interactions of topography, vegetation, and water level fluctuations on spatial variations in flow and sedimentation. Their flow domain was derived from a lidar DEM with 3m point spacing and a vertical accuracy of 0.13m. Hence, effects of depressions and creeks less than 3m wide were precluded. On the other hand, their model validation showed that the 3m DEM point spacing did not noticeably influence simulation results. In a related study of flow sensitivity to DEMs McKean et al. (2014) introduced random errors to a lidar DEM to assess the effects on 2D hydrodynamic simulations in a gravel bed stream, and they also found nominal effects. Cea and French (2012) investigated the sensitivity of hydrodynamic simulations to uncertainties in bathymetry and bed friction in subtidal, low intertidal, and high intertidal sub-regions of an estuary. In contrast to the studies above, they found a strong response in current velocity to bathymetry, whereas water level fluctuations were more influenced by bed friction. Also, numerical simulations by  successfully replicated tidal driven flows through a salt marsh but their tracer results were not as robust due to tracer retention in the marsh interior. These results led the authors to speculate that salt marsh circulation is highly sensitive to small scale variations in topography, and in particular to the effect of smaller \"capillary\" creeks less than 1m in width and depth. Taken together, these studies highlight the important point that researchers have yet to characterize, the role of small scale topographic structure on salt marsh circulation. The goal of this dissertation is to investigate the interactions of topography and currents for a flooding and ebbing salt marsh. Here, I use field observation, remote sensing and numerical simulations in Delft3D to quantitatively answer the research question: How much topographic detail is needed to accurately simulate overmarsh circulation and dye transport? This work provides a deeper understanding of salt marsh morphodynamics and ecosystem stability."}, {"section_title": "SCOPE OF THIS DISSERTATION", "text": "There are three parts to this study; the first is related to developing a high resolution DEM (digital elevation model) of a salt marsh, and two are on simulations of overmarsh currents using the hydrodynamic model Delft3D. In the first part of this work, Chapter 2, a 1km2 salt marsh island near Georgetown, SC was surveyed with high precision RTK GPS and lidar (light detection and ranging). The DEMs were quantitatively compared to characterize well airborne lidar can depict the microtopography of the salt marsh. I discovered that 78% of lidar elevations were within +/-0.25m of the high precision GPS elevations. However, spatial arrangement of elevation differences revealed that the lidar technology failed to resolve the overall structure of the salt marsh. Therefore, in a 1D sense lidar appears to be a robust tool for mapping intertidal landscapes because the majority of elevations were within the accepted range of accuracy. But in a 2D and 3D sense, the technology does not capture the subtle geomorphic structure of the landscape. Therefore, for research questions that require accurate depiction of small-scale tidal creek networks and subtle terrain features GPS surveys are optimal, and lidar surveys should be augmented with other elevation information. In Chapter 3, I studied the complexity in salt marsh circulation using field observations, dye tracer and numerical simulations. The marsh bathymetry was created with RTK GPS surveys to map intertidal creeks greater than 1m wide. Model calibration and validation were quantified, and the model results provide a robust representation of field observations of pressure, velocity and dye concentration. Moreover, the spatial distribution of simulated dye mimics the distribution observed in aerial photographs following a dye tracer release. Next, I assessed flow at four spatial scales ranging from 1m -1,000m and highlight the spatial and temporal variability of processes that give rise to overmarsh circulation. At times that were not necessarily linked to the transition between flood and ebb, the current magnitude and direction were highly dynamic occuring on the order of tens of minutes. Model results show simultaneous flow divergence and convergence, and focused flow, as well as large scale rotational flow. Also, assessments of dye circulation reveal that 53% transport of the dye export via overmarsh and intertidal creek flows, and 32% exiting through the central subtidal channel system; 15% remained in the system after five days. Hence, water parcels entering the system during flood do not necessarily exit by the same flowpath during ebb. Overall, I found that most of the modeled current complexity appears to be set by submergence and emergence of salt marsh topography. In Chapter 4, I progressively smooth the high precision GPS DEM to reduce topographic resolution. The series of smoothed DEMs is used in hydrodynamic simulations to quantify the effect of bathymetric smoothing on dye transport, and overmarsh flow. The primary goal of this work is to address a fundamental question in numerical simulations of natural landscapes: How much topographic detail is needed to accurately simulate flow processes? In addressing this question I am able to develop deeper insight into the role of intertidal creeks in overmarsh circulation. In this part of the study I use iterative comparisons between simulations resulting from initial and smoothed DEMs and quantify changes in dye transport and residence time, free surface elevation, velocity, flux and local currents."}, {"section_title": "ABSTRACT", "text": "Digital elevation models (DEMs) were compared to characterize how well airborne lidar (light detection and ranging) data depict the microtopography of a salt marsh. 72,000 GPS points and 700,000 lidar points from a 1km 2 salt marsh island were linearly interpolated using identical DEM configurations. Overall, 78% of lidar elevations were within \u00b10.15m of the high precision GPS elevations. Spatial arrangement of difference values reveal that lidar performed best on the marsh platform, and poorly along tidal creeks and creek heads. Also, the overall shape of the salt marsh was poorly defined, even where lidar data were within the reported range of accuracy. These observations indicate that lidar appears to be a robust tool for mapping intertidal landscapes. However, lidar DEMs may not adequately resolve the microtopographic variations of a salt marsh, and for research questions that require accurate depiction of small scale tidal creek networks and subtle terrain features lidar data should be augmented with other information."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "The horizontal and vertical accuracy of airborne lidar data are variable, principally dependent on the technical specifications of the sensor and peripherals, on mission specifics and terrain attributes (Kraus and Pfiefer, 1998;Baltsavias, 1999;Hodgson and Bresnahan, 2004). Nevertheless, most lidar service providers deliver data with vertical accuracies of about \u00b10.15m when compared to surveyed ground points (Baltsavias, 1999), and with a comparable root mean square error (rms) for bare earth returns (Hodgson and Bresnahan, 2004). Filtering can potentially improve the overall accuracy where surface and terrain features are considered less optimal due to dense vegetation canopy and steep slopes. For example, Kraus and Pfiefer (1998) used an iterative algorithm based on linear prediction of ground returns to remove vegetation effects in woodlands. The raw lidar dataset had an accuracy of \u00b10.25m but their filter yielded a bare-earth model with an accuracy of \u00b10.10m. Vosselman (2000) implemented a slope-based filter, and Sithole and Vosselman (2004) concluded that filtering algorithms work best in gently sloping terrain with small buildings and sparse vegetation. Photogrammetric processing techniques are also used to improve the accuracy of lidar by supplementing the detection of break lines and stream edges (Lane, 2000;Carter et al., 2001;Hicks et al., 2002;James et al., 2006). These studies indicate that lidar may be appropriate for applications in low lying coastal marshes and wetlands. For example, Montane and Torres (2006) directly compared a random sampling of lidar points to high precision GPS points and determined a vertical lidar over estimation of 0.07m for the vegetated marsh platform, with taller vegetation along creek banks giving rise to greater error. Moreover, several studies report <0.05m vertical accuracy for the salt marsh platform based on results from movingwindow smoothing (Yang, 2005;Wang et al., 2009). However, such filtering diminishes the microtopographic structure of salt marshes (Lohani and Mason, 2001) that has been shown to exert strong local control on over marsh currents (Torres and Styles, 2007;. Nevertheless, lidar DEMs have been an important component to studies in salt marsh circulation and morphodynamics Fagherazzi et al., 2006). The purpose of this study is to evaluate how well a salt marsh lidar DEM can replicate a high accuracy, high precision GPS surface. In this sense, we propose to conduct a 3D assessment of lidar technology for the microtopography of a salt marsh island based on a 72,000 GPS point DEM. Here we adopt a holistic approach by comparing DEMs from an entire salt marsh island. The island is taken as a geomorphic unit of landscape defined by subtidal channels and with a range of landscape attributes including intertidal creeks, depressions, platforms, levees and variable vegetation cover (Novakowski et al., 2004). Effects of the nominal 0.15m accuracy often quoted by lidar service providers, and the validation approaches taken to improve vertical lidar \"accuracy\" need further scrutiny, especially with salt marsh applications. This is especially important given the effects of microtopography on overmarsh circulation  where the total platform relief may be a few decimeters and the elevation uncertainty may or may not adequately depict the 3D structure.\nWhile conducting fieldwork in a salt marsh one can observe suspended and floating material in transit, and that this material can change speed and direction several times in the course of a tidal inundation. Of course, shifting wind conditions can account for surface water flow complexity, but overmarsh currents can vary substantially without wind effects (Kjerve et al., 1991;French and Stoddart, 1992;Leonard, 1997;Allen, 2000;Lawrence et al., 2004). Understanding the controls and scales of current complexity in salt marshes or tide influenced wetlands is important because in many cases it strongly influences the distribution of suspended and dissolved nutrients (Valiela et al., 1978), larva distribution (Kneib, 1984), and contaminant dispersal (Nixon, 1980;. Field and numerical studies indicate that the primary controls on salt marsh circulation and associated material redistribution include vegetation drag (Leonard and Luther, 1995;Christansen et al., 2000;Leonard and Reed, 2002;) and topography (French and Stoddart, 1992;Lawrence et al., 2004;Torres and Styles, 2007;Chen and Torres, 2012). However, the detailed bathymetry or high resolution DEMs necessary for assessing the role of very subtle relief of salt marshes on overmarsh circulation typically are not present, and consequently the role of topography could not be fully evaluated. For example,  used numerical simulations on a 0.05km 2 salt marsh catchment to assess the interactions of topography, vegetation, and water level fluctuations on spatial variations in flow and sedimentation. Their flow domain was derived from a lidar DEM with 3m point spacing and a vertical accuracy of 0.13m. Hence, effects of depressions and creeks less than 3m wide were precluded. On the other hand, their model validation showed that the 3m DEM point spacing did not noticeably influence simulation results.

Cea and French (2012) investigated the sensitivity of hydrodynamic simulations to uncertainties in bathymetry and bed friction in subtidal, low intertidal, and high intertidal sub-regions of an estuary. In contrast to the studies above, they found a strong response in current velocity to bathymetry, whereas water level fluctuations were more influenced by bed friction. Also, numerical simulations by  successfully replicated tidal driven flows through a salt marsh but their tracer results were not as robust due to tracer retention in the marsh interior. These results led the authors to speculate that salt marsh circulation is highly sensitive to small scale variations in topography, and in particular to the effect of smaller \"capillary\" creeks or intertidal creeks less than about 1m in width and depth. Taken together, these studies highlight the important point that researchers have yet to characterize the role of small-scale topographic structure on salt marsh circulation. Here we define overmarsh flow complexity as changes in current direction and magnitude that occur over short time intervals, and we use field observations of dye tracer dispersal and subtidal channel currents, and numerical simulations to understand the temporal evolution of and controls on overmarsh circulation. In particular we simulate salt marsh flood and ebb conditions over a high resolution and high precision salt marsh DEM to help unravel the role of topographic structure in spatial and temporal variations in salt marsh currents. Modeled pressure, velocity, and dye transport replicate field observations, and we use this information to evaluate complexity in overmarsh circulation at four spatial scales: the whole system or basin (1000m), macro (100m), meso (10m), and micro (1m) scales over a set of tidal cycles with the specific goal of providing a detailed account of basin inundation and drainage by assessing free surface elevation, tracer residence time, water balances and local currents. The assigned length increments of the four spatial scales are not necessarily meant to represent the length of individual flow assessments, but instead were taken to reflect the length scale of the underlying flow processes that we endeavored to highlight in this study."}, {"section_title": "STUDY SITE", "text": "The study was conducted on Maddieanna Island, a small salt marsh island in the North Inlet-Winyah Bay estuary, near Georgetown, SC (Figure 2.1a). The estuary is a relatively pristine mesotidal, ebb dominated lagoonal estuary that drains 32km 2 of intricately networked salt marsh tidal creeks and channels. Tides are semi-diurnal with a mean range of 1.50m (NOAA tide gauge #8662299). The island is located at the western edge of the estuary; approximately 1.5km from the terrestrial boundary. The island is 1.05km 2 of uninhabited salt marsh dissected by 24 tidal creeks varying in size and crosssectional geometry (Bell, 2009). The island is bound to the north by a major subtidal channel and to the south by channels fed by Winyah Bay (Figure 2a). The island is predominantly flat with most relief associated with channel networks. Unvegetated channels range from -1.36-0.00m (all elevations referenced to NAVD88); the marsh platform occurs between 0.00-0.32m, with levees and upland marsh from 0.32-0.78m giving 63% platform, 29% levee, 6% creek and 2% for surface depressions (Bell, 2009). The 0.0m elevation approximately corresponds to the transition between vegetated and unvegetated salt marsh. The vegetated marsh surface forms a monoculture of S. alterniflora from mid tide or higher (Morris et al., 2005). Short S. alterniflora grows on the platform and levees with stem heights of 0.15-0.55m; tall spartina occupies the lower marsh and creek banks with stem heights up to 1.70m (Bell, 2009).\nThe study site is a 2km 2 relatively isolated, section of a larger salt marsh system at 31.96\u00b0N, -81.02W\u00b0, ~20km south of Savannah, Georgia, USA (Figure 3.1). The local tidal regime is mixed, semi-diurnal and ebb dominant with a mean tidal range of 2.5m ( Figure 3.2). The basin is semi-enclosed with forested land to the west and south where the forest-marsh edge is defined by a 1m -3m bluff. The northern border of the study site is Groves Creek a sinuous, ~ 50m-wide subtidal channel that provides a connection between the salt marsh and the Wilmington River to the east (Figure 3.1). The neap and spring tidal prisms are 8.11x10 5 m 3 and 1.76x10 6 m 3 , respectively, based on the DEM volume between high water and low water elevations. The basin flushing-time, the hypothetical time for the exchange of one full basin volume (Equation 4 of Dyer, 1973) is 1.12 days and 0.52 days for neap and spring conditions, respectively. These flushing-time estimates are similar to basins with comparable surface areas, volume, tidal range and tidal prism (e.g. Abdelrhman, 2005). The vegetation is a monoculture of the smooth cordgrass Spartina alterniflora (S. alterniflora) with spatial variations in density and height dependent on surface elevation (Kostka, 2002;. For instance, tall form S. alterniflora with stem heights that exceed 2m and a density of about 112stems/m 2 , grows on the high channel banks and levees. The short form, which typically occurs on the lower marsh platform, has an average stem height of 0.28m, and a stem density of about 446 stems/m 2 . The vegetation heights and stem densities are based on clippings taken during a related study. In order of higher to lower elevations the study area consists of 10% levee, 46% marsh platform, 13% low marsh, 19% intertidal creeks, and 12% subtidal channel. Levees may occur along the subtidal channel and intertidal creeks, and reach 0.75m -1.30m (NAVD88). The marsh platform is a broad expanse of vegetated, low-relief landscape that forms between 0.45m -0.74m and has a mean of 0.61m. The low marsh is sparsely vegetated and forms at the heads of intertidal creeks and in some areas form a large depression between 0.21m -0.44m along an area of marsh east of the terrestrial boundary ( Figure 3.1). Hereafter we refer to this area as the \"marsh interior\".\nThe study site is a 2km 2 semi-enclosed salt marsh centered at 31.970\u00b0, -81.021\u00b0, ~20 km south of Savannah, Georgia, USA (Figure 4.1). The local tidal regime is mixed, semi-diurnal, ebb dominant with a mean tidal range of 2.5m and a tidal period of 12.4hrs (NOAA Station TEC3411). The local tidal range varies from 1.54m and 3.20m for neap and spring conditions, respectively (Station 1, Figure 4.2). The basin is bounded by forested land to the west and south where the forest-marsh edge is defined by a 1-3m cliff. Groves Creek is the main channel and it is 3.8km long from the mouth, but at 3.2km it splits into three ~30m wide subtidal branches; the West, Middle and East. The West and East branches surround an area of marsh that is highly dissected by complex networks of intertidal creeks (Figure 4.1). From the mouth of Groves Creek it is 11km to the coastal ocean, along the Wilmington River. The vegetation is a monoculture of the smooth cordgrass Spartina alterniflora (S. alterniflora) with spatially variable density and height that depend on surface elevation. In a related study we found that channel banks and levees typically have the tall form of S. alterniflora with stem heights that exceed 2m and a density of 112stems/m 2 . The short form has an average stem height of 0.28m \u00b10.25m, a stem density of 446stems/m 2 , and it typically occurs on the marsh platform. The intertidal creeks are unvegetated with a relatively smooth mud cover, and with oyster beds at some creek mouths. During a typical neap high tide the marsh platform and levees remain subaerial, but during spring conditions they are submerged. For this study we conduct simulations corresponding to conditions from October 31 st to November 5 th , 2010 as the tides transition from neap to spring with tidal ranges going from 2.1m to 3.2m. Hereafter, for brevity we refer to these stages as \"neap\" and \"spring\", with peak free surface elevations of 0.78m and 1.45m, respectively. At neap high tide the depth of water over the marsh platform is 0.33m and levees remain subaerial. During the spring high tide the depth of water over the marsh platform is 1.0m and the entire basin is submerged."}, {"section_title": "METHODOLOGY", "text": "The 72,000 GPS points were collected on foot from 2000-2002 using real time kinematic total stations with Trimble 5700 dual frequency receivers. The data have ~5m spacing on the marsh platform, 0.5-2.0m spacing along levees, and 0.25-0.50m spacing along creek banks; this higher density was needed to characterize the channel edge (Figure 2.1b). Horizontal and vertical measurements were referenced to the NAD1983 (2001) and NAVD88, respectively. GPS observations and difficult field conditions provided a practical accuracy of 0.04m vertical and 0.04m horizontal, and were used in calibrating the lidar mission and validating lidar elevations (Tamura et al., 2002;Hodgson and Bresnahan, 2004). The lidar mission was flown by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) on August 25, 2003. The mission began at 12:35 pm during a falling tide. An Optech 1233 ALTM lidar system was onboard a Cessna Citation at an altitude of 1,219m at 160 knots, yielding a post spacing of 1.40m. Following Sheng (2008) we estimated an at nadir laser footprint of 0.24m. There were six flight strips flown in a north-south direction with the three inner strips covering the island. Approximately 700,000 lidar points from the inner flight strips were used for this study. The lidar elevations were delivered as ellipsoid heights, and orthometric heights were calculated. First and last returns were not labeled as ground or vegetation. To reduce vegetation effects while avoiding smoothing of the data the lidar points were filtered such that all last returns having a separation of 0.15m or more from the first return were kept for the study. The lidar data were imported into ArcGIS and combined into a single point shapefile. Since the 72,000 GPS points were collected at variable point densities, the dataset is spatially biased with 57% of observations falling below 0.0m, or on 6% of the island area. To facilitate an unbiased comparison, the GPS and lidar data were linearly interpolated using a 0.25x0.25m grid with 8.1x10 6 nodes. The grid spacing corresponds to the finest spacing in the GPS data along creek edges. The GPS elevations were taken to be \"true ground\", and the signed error was computed for each location (Equation 2.1 after Hodgson and Bresnahan, 2004;Wang et al., 2009). DEMs based on the gridded elevations were created using geoprocessing tools. In order to minimize interpolation artifacts at the island perimeter we removed the outer most 5 pixels of both DEMs resulting in a net omission of 3.4% of gridded points. A surface map showing the spatial arrangement of SE was then generated using spatial analyst tools."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": "The histogram of interpolated GPS elevations is unimodal and ranges from -1.36m-0.78m (Figure 2.2a). The mean elevation is 0.21m and the mode is 0.25m, indicating a negative skew. The curve centers on the mode with the majority of elevations falling between 0.0m-0.60m. The median elevation is 0.21m. The standard deviation of the distribution is 0.18m. Figure 2a also shows the distribution of interpolated lidar elevations which range from -1.21m-2.06m. The mean elevation is 0.24m and the mode is 0.26m. The mean value is less than the mode indicating that the curve has a negative skew. The curve centers on the mode with the majority of elevations falling between 0.0m-0.70m. The median elevation is 0.21m. The standard deviation of the distribution is 0.27m. Overall, the distributions and shapes of the two histograms are similar ( Figure   2.2a). Both curves have negative skews. Each has a single peak, and similar modes; differing only by 0.01m. The median of both datasets are identical, but the comparison also shows some differences. For example, the GPS data extends 0.15m lower than the minimum lidar elevation. Also, the maximum lidar value is 1.28m higher than maximum GPS value. The mean of the lidar dataset is 0.04m greater than the mean GPS elevation. The standard deviation of the lidar dataset is 0.09m greater than that of the GPS distribution. Furthermore, a parametric test for equality between GPS and lidar means reveals a significant difference at a very high confidence interval (alpha = 0.005); indicating that the two datasets are statistically significantly different.  The lidar DEM has a subtle east to west transition in elevation but a strong south to north transition from higher to lower elevations. Poor lidar performance was most apparent along creeks and in low marsh areas (below 0.0m). As might be expected, these zones coincide with tall S. alterniflora, which forms a high canopy. Laser energy often fails to penetrate a dense vegetation canopy resulting in last returns that are well above the marsh surface (Jenson et al., 1998). Peak growing season at Maddieanna Island occurs during late summer and early fall and these lidar data were acquired in August of 2003. Thus, it is likely that mission timing, in part, contributed to many instances of last returns from the vegetation canopy rather than the ground surface. Researchers have demonstrated that a range of filtering algorithms and photogrammetric techniques can be used to remove the effects of vegetation from the data (e.g., Lane, 2000;James et al., 2006). For example, Wang et al. (2009) applied a moving window technique that quantified the optimum radius for identifying ground lidar returns over the salt marsh platform. The resulting DEM had a calibrated accuracy of 0.06m, consistent with the error of Montane and Torres (2006). However, the Wang et al. (2009) filter was limited to the marsh platform since the smoothing effects would likely lead to the complete loss of narrow channel structures (Lohani and Mason, 2001). We used a simple filter which reduced the influence of vegetation without smoothing but did not eliminate all vegetation effects; thus contributing to the mean positive error value of our lidar dataset. The SE surface map (figure 3c) also showed negative error values which can be explained by the absorption of laser energy by water standing on the marsh surface and in creeks. It is likely that some water may have been in part of the creek networks and perhaps standing on the platform, even at low tide. Lidar performance was optimal along the marsh platform and at higher elevations. The marsh platform (0.0m-0.32m) is vegetated, but the canopy is less dense and is occupied by the short form of S. alterniflora typically less than 0.50m high (Morris and Haskin, 1990). These conditions increase the likelihood that more laser energy will return elevations from the marsh surface. It is likely that the filtering techniques outlined by Wang et al. (2009) can be applied here to increase \"accuracy\" and help to resolve the subtle slope in the marsh platform, but at the expense of resolving 1 st order creeks. Photogrammetric techniques implemented by James et al., (2006) and Carter et al. (2001) had success in correcting DEMs and the techniques could be applied here to improve  Marsh platform is lower on average than seen in the GPS DEM.   CHAPTER 3 We characterize complexity in salt marsh circulation over a 2km 2 basin using field observations, dye tracer and numerical simulations. The marsh bathymetry was created with high precision Global Positioning System surveys to map intertidal creeks greater than 1m wide. Model calibration and validation were quantified, and the model results provide a robust representation of field conditions in that model efficiency varied from 0.82 -0.99 for pressure and velocity, and 0.36 -0.83 for dye concentration. Moreover, the overall spatial distribution of simulated dye mimics the distribution observed in aerial photographs. We assessed flow at four spatial scales ranging from 1m -1,000m, and highlight the temporal and spatial variability of processes that give rise to overmarsh circulation. At times not necessarily linked to the transition between flood and ebb, the current magnitude and direction were highly dynamic, with variations occurring on the order of tens of minutes. Model results show simultaneous flow divergence and convergence, concentrated flow, as well as large-scale rotational flow. Also, all spatial scales show strong differences between flood and ebb pathways, which gives rise to 53% transport of the dye export via overmarsh and intertidal creek flows, and 32% exiting through the central subtidal channel system; 15% remained in the system after five days. Most of the modeled current complexity appears to be set by submergence and emergence of salt marsh topography and geomorphic structure."}, {"section_title": "Groves", "text": "Creek is the main channel, and it is 3.8km along-channel from the furthest reach in the marsh interior to the mouth at the Wilmington River.

The standard hydrodynamic module is Delft3D FLOW and it is essential for modeling flow phenomena where horizontal length scales are significantly larger than the vertical (Lesser et al., 2000). Delft3D is well suited for this study and has been applied successfully to salt marsh research in several different locations , Marciano et al., 2005, Bouma et al., 2007and Fagherazzi et al., 2014. Computation of unsteady shallow-water flow is determined through the horizontal momentum equation, the continuity equations, and transport equations. Bed roughness and horizontal eddy viscosity are both user defined and typically follow from calibration. Delft3D FLOW uses a finite-difference approach to compute water level and depth averaged velocity at each node. The FLOW output is subsequently coupled to the PART module to simulate the advection and diffusion of particles. Delft3D PART accounts for the random spreading of particles through the horizontal dispersion coefficient H D defined by Equation 3.1 (Csanady, 1973)  where t is the age of the particle, and a and b are coefficients that emerge from the model calibration. For 2D flows the user must also specify a roughness length parameter, typically through calibration, which is used to calculate the logarithmic velocity profile. The simulations were conducted on a grid with uniform 1m horizontal spacing giving 5x10 6 computational nodes. The domain was closed to the west and south along the terrestrial border, and closed to the north along the outer bank of Groves Creek The model was calibrated with pressure and velocity data. The horizontal eddy viscosity was set to 0.0005m 2 /s  and bottom roughness was applied as a calibration variable by adjusting Manning's n values for vegetated (> 0.20m) and unvegetated (\u2264 0.20m) marsh, constrained by the range of n values for salt marshes (Table 3.2), and by comparing results to observations. The model efficiency (ME, after Nash and Sutcliffe, 1970) was calculated with the entire time series record to guide model validation and to determine optimal values for Manning's n as described below."}, {"section_title": "\u2211 \u2211", "text": "OBS(t) is the observed value at time t, SIM(t) is the modeled value at time t, and MEAN is the mean of the full time series.

Negative values signify conditions where the mean is a better predictor than the model. The highest ME was obtained by applying a Manning's n of 0.017 and 0.10 for unvegetated and vegetated marsh, respectively (Table   3.2), similar to values determined by French (2003). The modeled dye tracer was distributed over 7x10 6 particles, the maximum number of particles required to achieve the highest level of accuracy while maintaining computational stability. The accuracy of the tracer simulation was expressed as the smallest concentration that can be represented by a single particle in a computational cell. In our case, the smallest detectable concentration was 4ppb.

In particular, the model is highly efficient in simulating the time series at five of six stations (Figure 3.4). The simulated and observed data nearly overlie one another in five of the six stations and give a ME = 0.99. Station 2 has the least correspondence but maintains a robust ME = 0.92. However, the maximum and minimum water levels for each tidal cycle at Station 5 are offset by 0.10m -0.20m, but this systematic offset appears to be a related to uncertainty in instrument position. The ME assessment of velocity at a station was equally successful in most cases, with a range of 0.82 -0.94 (Table 3.3), and the velocity asymmetry is well replicated (Figure 3 Simulation results for the dye tracer at Stations 1, 2, 3, 3 grab, 5 grab, 6, 7 and 8 are overall successful in that the ME values are in the range of 0.30 -0.83 (Table 3.

The modeled dye distribution provided insight for determining the spatial scales of analysis needed to assess overmarsh circulation. We evaluated marsh circulation with maps of modeled free surface elevation, stage-velocity relationships, residence time, velocity, flux, and local currents at the fours scales of assessment. In particular, the basin scale (1,000m) was assumed to represent spatial patterns in bulk average flows of water and dye that entered and exited the salt marsh system. Circulation at this scale was described using three approaches. First the elevation of the free surface during the spring tide was mapped over the entire marsh at 20-minute intervals beginning at 4hrs after low water and ending 4hrs after high water. Water elevation contour maps were generated in ArcGIS and the corresponding areas of inundation were calculated for each time interval. The second approach made use of the proximity of Station 1 to the mouth of Groves Creek. Here we assumed that the \"upstream\" processes that affect flow at the mouth are encapsulated in the overall shape of the velocity -stage relationship for the spring tide. In this case we plotted the field data together with the simulated data to highlight the upstream geomorphic/topographic controls on a typical entry point for water in systems such as this, and the overall ability of the simulations to represent direct measurements. The final measure relied on tracer residence time for the 5-day interval as calculated from concentrations at stations 1, 2, 3, 6, 7 and 8. Residence time helps characterize the time required for a parcel of water to hypothetically enter and exit the system, and it can help quantify spatial variations in transport processes (Monsen et al., 2002). Assuming concentration of the tracer decreases exponentially with time and adopting equation 3.3 and 3.4 from Miller and McPherson (1991)  grab, 6, 7 and 8 for both observed data and simulations. The field data show that the dye appears at Station 1 8hrs after release. This is consistent with the dye release \"upstream\" of Station 1, and on the rising tide; hence dye could not reach the station until ebb. The first peak is 45ppb and it coincides with low tide (Figure 3.6a). The peak duration is 20 minutes and concentrations decline to zero at high tide. Subsequent peak concentrations also coincide with low tide and decay with time. For example, successive peaks are 28ppb, 17ppb, 11ppb, 7ppb, and 4ppb, respectively, decreasing by ~ 40% with each cycle (Table 3.4). Also, the duration of the peaks progressively increases to 2hrs with the final tidal cycle. The dye reaches Station 2 at the end of the ebb cycle 7.5hrs after the release, and again, because the station is \"downstream\" of the dye release. Peak concentrations occur at low tide and the first is 103ppb (Figure 3.6b) and lasts for 1.5hrs before declining to about 0 ppb at high tide. Subsequent peak values decay with time going from 52ppb, 30ppb, 18ppb, 11ppb, and 6ppb, again decreasing by ~ 40% with each cycle (Table 3."}, {"section_title": "4).", "text": "As with Station 1 the duration of the peaks increases with time and reaches a maximum of 4hrs. Station 3 is upstream of the dye release and in the direction of transport on the rising tide. The concentration time series is more complex relative to the response at stations 1 and 2, in that it exhibits a persistent double peak that gradually diminishes over several tidal cycles (Figure 3.6c). The first peak occurs just after high tide on November 2 nd is 130ppb and a second lower peak occurs on the rising tide. There is a local minimum that occurs between peaks at low tide and concentrations go to 0ppb at high tide. Peak concentrations decay with time going from 65ppb, 40ppb, 21ppb, 14ppb, and 8ppb (Table 3.4). The observed time series at Station 3 grab reflects the 2.5-hour time interval over which grab samples were collected ( Figure 3.6d and Appendix a). This station is also upstream of the dye release and initial concentrations reach the site about 1hr after the release. A peak concentration of 588ppb occurs just after low tide (Appendix a). Concentrations decline on the rising tide and go to zero 1.5hrs after the initial peak. Station 6 is upstream of the dye release and the response is much more complex and variable relative to the responses of other stations. The largest concentration for the time series occurs as an initial peak coinciding with the rising tide 3hrs after the dye release (Figure 3.6f), giving an average dye velocity of 0.16m/s. This peak goes from 0ppb to 530ppb, with the return to 0ppb occurring just before peak tide. This is followed by a double peaked interval with successive peaks occurring at mid tide during one risefall interval. Concentrations decline rapidly with time and the peak duration increases from 4hrs to 8hrs (Figure 3.6f). Subsequent increases in concentration lack the double peak and give more of a plateau response, and successive plateau values decline at a rate of 35-40%. Another apparently consistent response in this dye time series is smaller and relatively short-lived peaks that occur just after high tide, or just before the concentrations reach the plateau values. Station 7 is located further into the marsh interior between the subtidal system and the eastern marsh edge. The initial peak of 170ppb occurs during the first ebb tide, about six hours after the dye release (Figure 3.6g). Station 7 is dry at mid to low tide and this resulted in gaps of the time series. Peaks occurring during the subsequent ebb tides decrease exponentially from 89ppb, 54ppb, 38ppb, 21ppb, 16ppb, and 8ppb (Table 3.4). The Station 8 data have a response similar to that of Station 1 and 2 in that they increase from zero to a consistently higher range over an interval of about four hours midway between the ebb and flood phase, and the peak values decline with each successive tidal cycle (Figure 3.6h). However, the data differ in that at the onset of the higher four-hour interval the concentrations attain an initial peak before declining to a quasi-steady, higher value (Figure 3.6h). The initial dye response occurs 7hrs after the release and peaks at 79ppb. Tracer concentrations decay exponentially with time decreasing by ~ 40% with each cycle and with 5ppb remaining after six tidal cycles (Figure 3.6h), and the duration of the peaks is consistently 5 hours. In summary, peak concentrations range from 45ppb-1038ppb (Table 3.  where the time series of observation data is the shortest (Table 3.4). In summary, the model results mimic the observed data but there are substantial differences. Typically, the early simulation results are least representative with initial peak offsets of up to 400ppb, but they improve with time because the actual and simulated dye concentration gradients decrease with time as the plume spreads out. In addition, plotting the model results with field observations illustrates that there is an initial 30 minute offset between observation and simulations, and more importantly that this offset declines with time. Moreover, taking the mean of the time series removes phasing issues and reveals strong agreement between observed and simulated data. The model also captures the initial peak at Station 3 that was completely missed by the observed data."}, {"section_title": "DYE TRACER OVER THE BASIN", "text": "Simulation results show that two hours after dye release (three hours before high tide) there is dye transport along Groves Creek with a faster moving core (Figure 3.7a). This results in a 0.40km -0.70km long low concentration (< 50ppb) tail on either side of Groves Creek and higher concentration center plugs (> 500ppb) reaching the marsh interior through the subtidal branches (Figure 3.7a). For instance, high concentrations can be seen in the dissected marsh west of the Middle branch ( Figure 3.7a, coordinates 4.976x10 5 , 3.5368x10 6 ) and east of the middle branch (4.976, 3.5366). For brevity, we will no longer include the 10 5 and 10 6 factors when reporting coordinates. Lower At three hours into the dye release or two hours before high tide the maximum concentrations remain about 500ppb but shifted eastward and southward (Figure 3.7b). This is apparent in the Middle and West branches where 500ppb concentration is located farther east relative to Figure 3.7a and they form a front along the marsh interior ( Figure   3.7b). There is also a long tail of 500ppb to the west of the dissected marsh that is associated with westward transport along the southern terrestrial border (4.974, 3.5366). There are areas of high concentration in the dissected marsh west of the middle branch that surround a central area of relatively lower concentration, indicating convergence of flow from the north, west, and east (Figure 3.7b). At the same time, concentrations to the west and east of the middle branch are relatively higher than in the channel, indicating flow divergence. Lower concentrations < 50ppb occur along creek networks at higher elevations centered at 4.978, 3.5372, and in the subtidal channel branches, and along the dye plume fringes (Figure 3.7b). The orthorectified and color enhanced image (Figure 3  are more dilute and range from 25ppb -75ppb throughout the marsh interior and at the outer edge of the dye front. The front has a highly irregular shape with \"points\" that likely reflect overmarsh flow routing through intertidal creeks (Figure 3.9a). Also there are three areas of higher concentrations between 250ppb -350ppb in the marsh interior (Figure 3.9a). One area is along the terrestrial border to the west (4.974, 3.5366). The second is to the east near the head of the major intertidal creek with Station 8, and the third occurs in the dissected marsh (4.976, 3.5368). Clearly, some dye leaves the system from the large intertidal creek along the eastern marsh edge (Figure 3.9a). One hour later (three hours after high tide) the simulations show dye retention in the marsh but with limited extent, mainly confined to the south (Figure 3 (Figure 3.9b). The major intertidal system to the east is clearly an important part of salt marsh drainage as indicated by the higher concentrations feeding into it. In fact, we determined that 12% of the total dye mass exited the system from the eastern marsh edge, while 7% exited via the mouth of the main channel over the first full tidal cycle. Moreover, over the full five-day simulation interval we found that 53% of the total dye mass exited the system from the eastern marsh edge while 32% exited via the mouth of the Groves Creek. The remaining 15% was retained in the marsh interior. In summary, the modeled dye transport results highlight the complexity in inundation timing and flow direction throughout the basin, and patterns of overmarsh circulation. The tracer reveals that the interior dissected marsh area first inundates from the east through the Middle branch, and subsequently from the west through the relatively longer West branch. Moreover, there is simultaneous flow divergence and convergence in the marsh interior. Also, the dye results show differences between flood and ebb circulation indicating that water parcels on the flood do not necessarily follow a similar but reversed path on ebb. Finally, after six tidal cycles most of the dye was transported out of the system via the eastern marsh edge. including lower areas of the marsh platform; while the higher areas and levees are dry (Figure 3.10b). The free surface elevation is 0.76m along the eastern marsh edge, 0.71m in the subtidal channel and intertidal creeks, and <0.67m in the marsh interior. At 9:40 91% of the marsh is submerged, with mostly levees being subaerial (Figure 3.10c). The maximum water surface elevation is 0.87m along the eastern marsh edge and 0.79m in the marsh interior. At 10:00 98% of the marsh is inundated and only the highest levees along the main channel are dry (figure 3.10d). The water surface is 1.03m along the eastern marsh edge, 0.98m in the marsh interior, and 0.95m in the southwest. The distance between minimum and maximum elevations is 500m yielding a maximum slope of 1.6x10 -4 toward the southwest and indicating inundation from the basin exterior and to a lesser extent intertidal creeks and Groves Creek. At 10:20 99% of the marsh is inundated and only the two highest levees along the first and third bend in Groves Creek are subaerial (Figure 3.10e). The elevation of the water surface is 1.15m along the eastern marsh edge and decreases to 1.11m in the west and the maximum slope toward the southwest decreases to 8x10 -5 . At this time the source of water inundating the marsh is from the basin exterior, rather than from subtidal and intertidal conduits. At 10:40 the entire marsh is inundated and the free surface elevation is > 1.25m. The two highest levees remain submerged over the final 20 minutes (Figure 3.10f)."}, {"section_title": "BASIN SCALE CIRCULATION", "text": "Model results also show in-channel variations in surface water topography. At 9:20 there is a 0.03m higher water level along the outside bank of the second bend in the channel. More importantly, the same phenomenon occurs at bends along Groves Creek, far from the domain boundaries. This accumulation of water in channel bends has been reported by (Georgas and Blumberg, 2003, and others) and it corresponds to the effects of centrifugal acceleration. System drainage is illustrated by Figure 3.11. At 12:00 the entire marsh is submerged starting with a bulge of water of 1.25m focused in the southwest part of the basin (Figure 3 In summary, the free surface slopes, and hence the direction of inundation changes as the percentage of inundated area increases. Inundation occurs from the interior by flow from the subtidal to intertidal creeks during the first four hours when 46% of the basin is inundated. Between 9:00 and 9:40 inundation increases, the relief of the water surface increases to 0.08m and the resulting slope increases to 1.6x10 -4 ; also the eastern marsh edge, intertidal creeks and the subtidal channels are submerged at this time. Two hours before high tide the entire marsh is submerged, the maximum difference in water surface elevation is 0.04m, maximum slope decreases to 8x10 -5 , and there is a change in the source of inundation going from the subtidal system to overmarsh flow toward the southwest. Similarly, ebb circulation changes with decreasing area of submergence. At the onset of drainage water leaves the salt marsh as a type of sheetflow outward from the southwest toward the basin perimeter, and it persists for the first 3 hours of ebb. An hour later the marsh topography becomes subaerial, and there is a maximum slope of 1.8x10 -4 to the east indicating strong flow over the eastern marsh edge, followed by flow divergence in the marsh interior. Another insightful way to assess basin scale flow is to evaluate the stage-velocity association at a station, in this case near the mouth of Groves Creek, Station 1 ( Figure   3.12). The observations show that the peak flood and ebb velocities are comparable and have the characteristic asymmetry with ebb dominance (Myrick and Leopold, 1963;Boon, 1975;Pethick, 1980;French and Stoddart, 1992;Fagherazzi et al., 2008). In particular, peak flood velocity occurs at a higher stage than peak ebb. For example, on the spring tide the peak occurs at 1.15m and peak ebb occurs at 0.40m (Figure 3.12). Meanwhile velocity reaches 0.51m/s between a low tide elevation range of -1.68m -0.63m. Subsequently, there is a surge in velocity reaching a peak of 0.93m/s at 1.15m (Figure 3.12). Currents then reverse and peak ebb velocity of -0.95m/s occurs at 0.7m. The modeled stage-velocity relationship is comparable. Overall it shows flood velocity increases to 0.52m/s between a low tide range of -1.67m -0.62m (Figure 3.12). This is followed by a surge in velocity reaching a peak of 0.69m/s at 0.93m. Currents reverse and peak ebb of -0.95m/s occurs at 0.35m. Velocities then decrease between peak and low tide and much more rapidly than during flood. Comparing the observed and simulated data shows that the model accurately predicts the overall stage-velocity relationship for Station 1. Both the simulated and observed datasets show ebb velocities decreasing at a faster rate than during the same stages of flood. Moreover, the model captures the surge in flood velocity at stages when the topography is submerged and overmarsh flow is initiated (Boon, 1975;French and Stoddart, 1992). Both curves also show comparable asymmetry between peak flood and ebb velocity during higher stages. Specifically, peak flood is tied to the marsh platform elevation, as expected. Together these observations and analyses show that the modeled and observed flows at the mouth of the main channel are comparable, and the \"upstream\" overmarsh flow processes that give rise to the velocity-stage shape and distributions are also comparable, as well. A third metric for assessing basin scale flow makes use of residence time, an estimate of the duration of a water parcel in the basin system. The tracer residence time (Rt) expressed through equation 3 and calculated from the observation data at Stations 1, 2, 3, 6, 7 and 8 ranges from 1.09 -1.12 days with an average of 1.07 days (Table 3.5). The modeled Rt values are comparable, ranging from 1.02-1.12 days (Table 3.5). Therefore, we can expect that the innermost water parcels will be flushed from the system within about 1 day."}, {"section_title": "MACRO SCALE CIRCULATION", "text": "At two hours before high tide the mean depth of water on the marsh platform is 0.58m. The mean velocity over the platform and eastern marsh edge is 0.02m/s and 0.08m/s, respectively (Figure 3.13a). The average flow vectors along the eastern marsh edge and in the north (Figure 3.13a coordinates 4.980, 3.5372) indicate inundation predominantly from the basin edges as opposed to the channel network.

Flow complexity has been a common theme in salt marsh flow studies (Eiser and Kjerfve, 1986;Kjerfve, 1991;Christiansen et al., 2000;Torres and Styles, 2007;Mariotti and Fagherazzi, 2011); yet no studies have characterized this complexity for a comparably large section of salt marsh as conducted here, and none have addressed its origin. Here we found that the source for the onset of complex overmarsh circulation is the submergence and emergence of the very subtle salt marsh platform relief. For example, emergent topography can completely shut off some flow pathways while initiating new ones. The spatial variability in dye concentration from the model largely replicates field observations as indicated by the strongly positive ME values. Results were somewhat less robust at Stations 3, 5 and 8. We propose that the Station 3 (ME = 0.36) discordance arose because the simulations produced a large initial spike in concentration that was not detected in the hourly observation data. Given equation 2 this translates directly to a poor model performance. The lower ME for Station 5 likely is a product of the phase offset between simulation and observation over the full two hour record for these grad samples. However, phase shifts are also apparent with all comparisons of simulated and observed but the shift declines over the 5-day interval. Therefore, given the short record of Dye circulation patterns reveal that the sheet flow over the largely flat salt marsh landscape is not homogeneous, but has strong temporal and spatial variability that arise from simultaneous convergence, divergence and rotation in the marsh interior during flood. This type of complexity in overmarsh circulation is important in salt marshes because it strongly influences the distribution of suspended and dissolved nutrients, larvae distribution, and contaminant dispersal (Valiela et al., 1978;Kneib, 1984;. For instance, the flow fields in Figures 3.13a and 3.13b illustrate the source of the dye front that occurs 2hrs before high tide. The dye circulation also shows that there is considerable drainage directly over the eastern marsh edge during ebb. Hence, a parcel of inundation water does not necessarily follow the same track between flood and ebb (e.g., French and Stoddart, 1992). The dye response also highlights spatial variability in flow complexity throughout the Groves Creek system. For instance, stations located in the ebb direction of the injection have single peaks coincident with low tide, whereas all other stations have double peaks, one on the ebb and one on the flood limbs of tidal stage. A similar response in salinity was reported by Warner et al. (2006) who attributed the double peak to confluence effect at tributary channels (Warner et al., 2006). At the meso scale flows across transect 1 indicate that net transport is away from the marsh interior, and ebb dominant. The variability between 1a and 1b may be set by the average transect elevation with 1a at 0.62m \u00b10.09m, and 1b at 0.56m \u00b10.15m. Also, these transects essentially represent water exchange between the marsh interior and Groves Creek, and the marsh interior and the Wilmington River, 1a and 1b, respectively. Therefore, we contend that the net fluxes reflect a type of circulation where water inundates the marsh through the channel network but principally drains over the marsh edge. This is consistent with the tracer and macro scale flow results. We also show positive net flow for transects 2a-2d and this is taken with their respective spatial arrangement to indicate counterclockwise rotation during part of the tidal cycle ( Figure   3.3, Table 3.6). At the micro scale we show that intertidal creeks are active only during a small portion of the tidal cycle, and for about one hour longer during ebb tide than flood. The time that intertidal creeks convey flow is of course dependant on bed elevation, and these vary substantially. The intermittent control of topography on local in channel currents together with shifts in the larger scale barotropic pressure gradient give rise to additional current reversals during flood and ebb (e.g. Torres and Styles, 2007;Fagherazzi et al., 2008). Clearly, topography is an important control on overmarsh circulation.

This is primarily due to the extremely high quality salt marsh DEM and the range and quality of field data for calibration and validation. Numerical assessments of dye transport and circulation reveal strong complexity in overmarsh currents with the temporal evolution of inundation, and drainage at water levels within 0.2m of the mean platform elevation. Moreover, over the full five-day simulation interval we found that 53% of the dye mass exited the system at the eastern marsh edge, while 32% exited via the mouth of   Table 3.2 A list of literature sources for Manning's roughness coefficients for vegetated and unvegetated marsh. Citations with an asterisk were final selections for the study.\nHere we ask the question: How much DEM detail is need to accurately represent overmarsh circulation in a Georgia, USA salt marsh? Smoothing a highly accurate DEM with a window of 17m x 17m effectively removes small scale intertidal creek systems and the corresponding overmarsh flow simulations are not affected. However, smoothing with a 50m x 50m window reveals a threshold in hydrodynamic response that is coincident with the removal of short-circuiting pathways between the marsh interior and the larger subtidal system. Hence, for accurate simulations of overmarsh circulation the DEM must account for the hydraulic connectivity of the basin, but not necessarily the smaller intertidal creeks and creek networks.

They found a strong response in current velocity to bathymetry, while water level fluctuations were influenced more by bed friction. In another study, Camacho et al., performed uncertainty analysis for 3D hydrodynamic simulations to determine the impact of bathymetric error. They documented strong influence of bathymetry on current velocity and water salinity for locations where DEM depths were shallower than field observations. These findings contrast with the results of . They used a 3D hydrodynamic-sediment transport model on a 0.05km 2 tidal creek catchment to assess the interactions of topography, vegetation, and water level fluctuations on spatial variations in flow and sedimentation. Their flow domain was a lidar DEM reduced to 3m point spacing with a vertical accuracy of 0.13m. Hence, depressions and creek systems that were less than 3m wide were filled in and their effects excluded. Despite this apparent limitation the model validation was successful and the adjusted DEM did not significantly influence simulation results. More recently, Falcao et al., (2013) investigated the influence of grid size and bathymetric interpolation errors in simulating the flooding of intertidal areas. They found that a 5m grid with vertical offsets of up to 0.25m had a very limited impact on the computation of high water levels and aerial extent of inundation, but found discordance in model results for the low spring tide. In a salt marsh tracer and modeling study  successfully replicated hydrodynamics of subtidal channels; however, the modeled dye plume distribution and concentrations were less successful. These results led the authors to propose that marsh circulation is highly sensitive to small-scale variations in topography, and in particular to first order intertidal creeks. Recently, the Blanton et al. salt marsh basin was surveyed in high detail using RTK GPS that produced a 1m DEM with 0.02m vertical accuracy. This high resolution DEM was used in simulations of overmarsh flow to highlight complexity in salt marsh circulation (Sullivan et al., 2015) and model results were robust; they accurately replicated observations of dye concentration, pressure, velocity, and local currents. Moreover, the model revealed highly complex flow patterns in space and time that arise from the submergence-emergence of topography. In this study, we progressively smooth a high precision and high accuracy DEM to gradually reduce topographic detail. The smoothed DEMs were used in hydrodynamic simulations to ascertain the quality of DEM data needed for representative salt marsh flow simulations. Consequently, the progressive smoothing will provide deeper insight into the role of microtopography and intertidal creeks in overmarsh circulation. Here we highlight the effect of smoothing on free surface elevation, velocity and flux, and with dye circulation and residence time."}, {"section_title": "MODEL DESCRIPTION AND SETUP", "text": "Here we use the validated Delft3D model reported by Sullivan et al. (2015). The simulation package consists of integrated modules to compute water currents, water quality, and particle transport. The standard hydrodynamic module is Delft3D FLOW and it accurately simulates flows where horizontal length scales are significantly larger than the vertical (Lesser et al., 2000). It relies on a finite-difference approach to compute water level and depth averaged velocity at each node. The output is subsequently coupled to the PART module to simulate the advection and diffusion of particles. Delft3D PART accounts for the random spreading of particles through the horizontal dispersion coefficient H D defined by Equation 1 (Csanady, 1973) (4.1) where t is the length of time that a particle of water stays in the system, and a and b are coefficients that emerge from the model calibration. For these 2D flow simulations a roughness length parameter is specified through model calibration, and this in turn helps determine the logarithmic velocity profile. The horizontal eddy viscosity is set to 0.0005m 2 /s  and bottom roughness is applied as two spatially variable Manning's n values that follow from model calibration. The Manning's n for vegetated and unvegetated marsh are set to 0.10 and 0.017, respectively, comparable to the range of published salt marsh values reported in the literature (see summary in Sullivan et al., 2015). In order to establish experimental control, it is necessary to hold the bottom roughness constant while altering the salt marsh landscape. This means that we assume the area corresponding to channel bed roughness is held constant for each smoothing interval although the channel may experience widening in the smoothing process. This widening however has a negligible effect on simulation results, as explained below. The modeled dye tracer consists of 7x10 6 particles, the maximum number required to achieve the highest level of accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. The accuracy of the tracer simulation is set as the lowest concentration that can be represented by a single particle in a computational cell; in this case it is 4ppb. Horizontal dispersion parameters are set to a = 0.20m 2 /s and b = 0.02, and a roughness length of 0.001m follow from model calibration. A computational time step of 0.025 minutes is used to establish numerically stable simulations, and results are output at 10 minute intervals."}, {"section_title": "MARSH STRUCTURE AND DRAINAGE DENSITY", "text": "The high resolution DEM is used to generate an elevation contour map to highlight the 2D structure of the marsh landscape, calculate the area of land features, and the help estimate the drainage density, (Dd) of intertidal creeks. Conventionally, Dd of a network is the ratio of total creek length divided by the watershed area. Here, we use the total creek length and total basin area. Creek length is estimated by taking the length of the 0.20m contour that outlines individual creeks. The 0.20m contour was selected because field observations indicate that this elevation represents the \"break line\" between creek edge and platform. We then halve each creek contour length and define that value as creek length.

Further, we quantify changes in tracer residence time at various stations, and for each simulation. Residence time, Rt helps characterize topographic control on the time required for a parcel of water to enter and exit the system. Assuming concentration of the tracer decreases exponentially with time (after Miller and McPherson, 1991) residence time is computed as: where at each station C(t) is the concentration at time t, C o is the initial concentration, and k is a decay constant taken as a first order removal rate. Residence time (Rt) is the inverse of the removal rate."}, {"section_title": "DEM SMOOTHING AND OVERMARSH CURRENTS", "text": "The scales of overmarsh flow analyses are basin (1,000m), macro (100m) and meso (10m). These length scales are not necessarily the lengths of associated measurements but instead they are taken to represent the length scale of underlying flow processes. The basin scale metrics represent spatial patterns of bulk average flows entering and exiting the salt marsh system. The elevation of the free surface during spring tide is mapped over the entire domain at 20 minute intervals during the two hours before and after high tide. Water elevation contour maps are used to compute the free surface slope over a 500m distance between the marsh interior and the Wilmington River ( Figure   4.2). The slope is monitored at each smoothing interval, but with particular focus on two hours before and after high tide coinciding with the onset and end of overmarsh flow, respectively. At the macro scale we investigate changes in the magnitude and direction of velocity vectors averaged over a 60m x 60m grid. This grid size was selected through an iterative grid averaging process for the representation of flows through the marsh interior. Evaluating smoothing effects at this scale is useful in highlighting the topographic controls on circulation complexities at intermediate tidal stages and within the marsh interior. Rose diagrams of initial and smoothed vectors at 2hrs before and after high tide are compared at each smoothing. The meso scale approach relies on a water balance approach between flood and ebb across six transects (Figure 4.2). Transect 1 encloses the marsh interior but is separated into two parts to account for flows between distinct subtidal systems. Hence, Transect 1a is between the marsh interior and Groves Creek, and 1b is between the marsh interior and the Wilmington River (Figures 4.1 and 4.2). These transects are 500m long and each consists of ten 50m long segments (Figure 4.2) to allow for transect flexibility with respect to topographic structure. Another set of four 50m long transects (2a, 2b, 2c, and 2d) are placed to determine flow characteristics within the marsh interior.  Figure 4.3a shows the structure of the landscape prior to smoothing. The subtidal system has a mean elevation of -2.74m, and a total length of 3,210m. The corresponding subtidal area is 0.16km 2 , or about 11% of the basin area (Table 4.1). The main channel narrows from 128m at the mouth to about 30m at the three branches. Each of the branches also becomes narrower in the \"upstream\" direction, down to less than 1m at the terrestrial edge (Figure 4.3a). The West branch is the longest at 1,360m, followed by the Middle at 717m, and the East at 485m. There are 88 intertidal creeks with a total area of 0.27km 2 and a mean bed elevation of -0.16m \u00b1 0.26m (Figure 4.3a). The creek lengths and widths vary from 10m -500m and 1m -20m, respectively. Many creeks cut through well-defined levees along the main stem of Groves Creek and some incise the marsh platform, extending hundreds of meters (Figure 4.3a). The smaller and shorter creeks typically occur along the first 2,300m of Grove's Creek and are relatively straight with nominal branching. Between the East and Middle branches creeks tend to form closed loops that produce small intertidal islands less than 500m 2 . However, between the West and Middle branches most intertidal creeks are sinuous and branching, and have creek heads originating in a single elongate depression. The area between the East and West branches is referred to as the \"dissected marsh\" (Figure 4.1 and 4.3a). To the east, along the Wilmington River the largest and deepest intertidal creeks occur. In particular, Hannah's Creek, the site of Station 8 ( Figure   4.1 and 4.3a), is 500m long, becoming narrower and shallower in the upstream direction from 14m -4m, and -1.2m -0.09m, respectively. Above the intertidal creeks is the low marsh; it has a mean elevation of 0.34m \u00b1 0.07m and an area of 0.18km 2 (Table 4. (Figure 4.3a). The position and orientation of some low lying areas facilitate early and far-reaching inundation and late and prolonged drainage as the tide rises and falls, respectively. The marsh platform is the most extensive feature with a total area of 0.64km 2 , or 46% of the domain (Table 4.1) and a mean elevation of 0.60m \u00b1 0.07m (Figure 4.3a). The expanse of platform is cut by low marsh troughs that divide the landscape into smaller, isolated subplatform areas particularly to the north and east of the marsh interior (Figure 4.3a) and is incised by various intertidal creek systems. In particular, there are three locations where the troughs dividing the platform may allow hydraulic short circuiting of the flow system in that they can serve as important conduits for transport during flood and ebb conditions. These troughs are located east of the marsh interior and form a direct link with the larger subtidal system. The first is located approximately 600m north of the southern terrestrial border (Figure 4.3a) and connects the marsh interior to Grove's Creek. Two others are located at the heads of Hannah's Creek and connect the marsh interior to the Wilmington River (Figure 4.3a). Levees occupy 0.15km 2 or 10% of the total area (Table 1), and they have a mean elevation of 0.85m \u00b1 0.07m (Figure 4.3a). The continuity and shape of levees vary, with the longest and most continuous occurring along the northeast-southwest reach of Grove's Creek. Most levees along the first 2km of channel vary in height and width and are typically cross-cut by intertidal creeks (Figure 4.3a). Smaller, isolated levees tend to form along the banks of the subtidal branches, and along the banks of intertidal creeks ( Figure   4.3a). In summary, the salt marsh landscape is characterized by highly variable microtopography that define subtidal channels, intertidal creek networks, low marsh, marsh platform and levees. The smallest and shortest intertidal creeks typically occur along the first 2,300m of Grove's Creek, while creek networks in the marsh interior and along the eastern marsh edge are larger and longer. In particular, there are three locations where intertidal creek networks and low marsh troughs link the marsh interior to (1) Grove's Creek and (2 and 3) to the Wilmington River. Below, we report how topographic smoothing affects the system overall and in particular the hydraulic connectivity of the marsh with the subtidal areas. With the 10 smoothing there is no change in subtidal channel area (Table 4.1) or mean elevation and nominal change in the structure of the three branches (Figure 4.3b). The mean elevation of intertidal creeks increases to -0.14m \u00b1 0.25m, and the smallest creeks along the first 2km of Grove's Creek are now classified as low marsh ( Figure   4.3b), and this results in an 11% increase in low marsh area (Table 4.1). Moreover, the connection between the marsh interior and Grove's Creek at about 600m north of the southern boundary is lost, and the associated low marsh trough becomes discontinuous (Figure 4.3b). However, the two troughs at the head of Hannah's Creek persist and the connection between the marsh interior and the Wilmington River remains intact ( Figure   4.3b). The mean marsh platform elevation decreases to 0.59m \u00b1 0.07m, and its area increases by 2% (Table 4.1). The mean levee elevation also decreases to 0.83m \u00b1 0.07m, and the smallest levees are now classified as marsh platform (Figure 4.3b), resulting in a 20% decrease in levee area (Table 4.1). With the 17 smoothing the subtidal channel shallows as the mean elevation increases to -2.65m \u00b1 (Figure 4.3c). The narrower reaches of the three subtidal branches become intertidal creeks, resulting in a 4% increase in intertidal creek area (Table 4. (Figure 4.3c). The mean elevation of the marsh platform is slightly lower at 0.58m \u00b1 0.07m. The mean levee elevation is the same as with the 10 smoothing, but 40% of levees are now classified as marsh platform (Figure 4.3c). The 50 smoothing increases the mean elevation of the subtidal channel to -2.4m \u00b1 1.25m, and the three subtidal branches become intertidal creeks (Figure 4.3d), resulting in a 6% decrease in subtidal channel area (Table 4.1). The three branches now connect the main stem of Groves Creek to a large intertidal depression in the marsh interior ( Figure   4.3d). Together, these changes produce a 26% increase in intertidal creek area, despite the removal of most intertidal creek structures (Figure 4.3d). The low marsh increases by 33% and is mostly associated with the area surrounding the large depression ( Figure   4.3d). However, the low marsh trough between the marsh interior and the Wilmington River is now discontinuous, and there are no direct links between the marsh interior and the larger subtidal system (Figure 4.3d). The mean elevation of the marsh platform decreases to 0.57m \u00b10.07m, and 5% of the platform area is now classified as low marsh. The mean levee elevation is 0.82m \u00b1 0.06m, and 60% have are replaced by marsh platform with four large levees remaining along the main stem of Groves Creek (Figure   4.3d). The 100 smoothing results in the mean elevation of the subtidal zone as being -1.8m \u00b1 0.80m, and 12% of the subtidal area is now intertidal (Figure 4.3e). The main channel stem extends to the western terrestrial border where it connects to a trough that is linked to a large depression in the marsh interior (Figure 4.3e). Both the trough and the depression fall within the range of intertidal creek elevations, resulting in a 48% increase in intertidal creek area (Table 4.1). However, intertidal creeks have been completely removed and are now classified as low marsh and marsh platform (Figure 4.3e). The marsh platform is lower, with a mean elevation of 0.56m \u00b1 0.06m, and 12% of the area is reclassified as low marsh. In summary, the 10 and 17 smoothings result in a shallower subtidal environment, removal of most intertidal creek networks, and a discontinuous link between the marsh interior and Grove's Creek. After 50 and 100 the subtidal channel is shorter and feeds a large depression in the marsh interior. Moreover, intertidal creek networks are completely removed and there are no low marsh troughs connecting the marsh interior and the larger subtidal system. Also, 74% of levee area is removed."}, {"section_title": "DRAINAGE DENSITY", "text": "Initially, the total length of intertidal creeks in the 1.4km 2 basin area was 25.8km, giving an average drainage density of 18.5km/km 2 (Table 4.2). For comparison, Marani et al., (2003) evaluated the drainage density of 136 watersheds within 20 salt marshes from the northern lagoon of Venice. They found a fairly constant drainage density of about 20km/km 2 . Meanwhile, Novakowski et al., (2004) found a drainage density of 13.8km/km 2 for a salt marsh island located near North Inlet, SC. Hence, the drainage density estimated for Groves Creek is comparable to other salt marshes in various geographic regions. The 10 smoothing reduces the total creek length to 11.1km, giving a drainage density of 7.9km/km 2 (Table 4.2). The 17 smoothing results in a total creek length of 6.3km, yielding a drainage density of 4.5 km/km 2 ; a 75% decrease from the initial value. Hence, after 17 most intertidal creek networks are removed. After 50, the total creek length is 1.6km and the drainage density is reduced further to 1.1km/km 2 (Table 4.2). The final smoothing of 100 results in a total creek length of 0.75km and a drainage density of 0.53 km/km 2 ; which is 3% of the original value. In summary, 10 and 17 substantially reduce the total length of intertidal creeks and they reduce the drainage density by 75%. Hence, the majority of intertidal creeks have been removed in the first two smoothings. The 50 and 100 smoothings result in a complete removal of intertidal creeks. An ancillary benefit of conducting simulations on a sequentially smoothed DEM is that we gradually remove the intertidal creek system and consequently the simulation results from those conditions help highlight the role of intertidal creeks in overmarsh circulation."}, {"section_title": "DEM SMOOTHING AND BASIN SCALE CIRCULATION", "text": "At 9:00 46% of the total area is inundated and the water surface elevation is < 0.67m (Figure 4.4a). During this time water is confined to the subtidal system, lower intertidal creek networks, and low marsh. At 9:40, or two hours before high tide, 91% of the marsh is inundated with most levees subaerial (Figure 4.4c). The maximum water surface elevation is 0.87m to the east and 0.75m in the marsh interior. At this time the marsh floods from the east to the southwest as a type of sheetflow rather than from Groves Creek, and persists until high tide. At 12:40 the water surface is 1.25m in the marsh interior and decreases outward to 1.19m (Figure 4.5a). At 13:40, or two hours after high tide, the elevation decreases from 0.85m in the marsh interior to 0.67m in the subtidal channel and some intertidal creeks (Figure 4.5d). At 14:00 24% of the marsh is subaerial with a water surface of 0.72m across the western low marsh and in the marsh interior (  Table 4.3 highlights the free surface slope over the eastern marsh edge during flood and ebb, at two hours before and after high tide, respectively. Initially, the free surface slope on flood is westward at 1.4x10 -4 (Table 4.3). On ebb the slope is 3.0x10 -4 toward the east, 53% greater than flood. Here, we take the greater slope and likely stronger flow over the marsh edge during ebb than during flood as an indication of ebb dominance (Bayliss-Smith et al., 1979;Myrick and Leopold 1963;Healey et al., 1981). Each smoothing gives rise to an increase in the free surface slope during flood, indicating more robust flows to the west. Slopes increase from 1.14x10 -4 initially to 4.0x10 -4 for the 100 smoothing (Table 4.3). During ebb the eastward sloping free surface responds differently. First, the 10 and 17 smoothings produce a slope that remains unchanged relative to the initial. At 50 and 100 the slope increases slightly, but much less than was detected during flood. Hence, smoothing has a greater effect on flood than on ebb. In particular, with the 50 and 100 the westward flow during flood is likely stronger than during ebb indicating that the higher quality DEM shows ebb dominance while the lower quality DEMs show flood dominance. Overall, the basin scale analysis shows that the directions of inundation and drainage vary with the area of submerged marsh. In particular, at two hours before and after high tide, water moves as southwesterly and easterly overmarsh flows. Moreover, the high quality DEM produced an eastward free surface slope that is greater than the southwesterly slope during flood, and we take this to represent ebb dominance. Topographic smoothing results in a progressive increase in free surface slope and to a greater extent during flood. In fact, the 50 and 100 smoothings produces a southwesterly flood slope that exceeds the eastward ebb slope. Reducing topographic detail resulted in the overall system switching from ebb to flood dominance."}, {"section_title": "DEM SMOOTHING AND MACRO SCALE CIRCULATION", "text": "The effects of DEM smoothing on macro scale circulation were evaluated by monitoring changes in average velocity vectors in a 60m x 60m window and comparison with the initial unsmoothed results. For brevity, rose plots of velocity magnitude and direction at 2hrs before and after high tide are compared for each smoothing (Figure 4.6). In general, the results at 9:40 for the original DEM show westerly flows that exceed 0.20m/s, and < 0.05m/s flows in all directions (Figure 4.6a). Also, high velocities occur toward the northwest and southwest. Intermediate to these are southwesterly flows that reach up to 0.15m/s. In all cases flood conditions for the smoothed DEMs have most of the higher velocities and in more directions (Figure 4.6). Also, the occurrence of the higher velocity increases with successive smoothings but westerly flows remain most common. The 10 had negligible effect on current direction, with 30% to the west and 15% southward (Figure 4.6b). Also, the maximum and mean velocity increases slightly to 0.35m/s and 0.06m/s, respectively. The 17 produced similar results but gave rise to northwesterly flow (Figure 4.6c). With 50 the flows toward the northwest are reduced while flow speeds to the west, southwest and east increase (Figure 4.6d). In to 100, the majority of flood vectors are toward the west, southwest and south (Figure 6e). Flow is also stronger in all directions and the maximum velocity increases to 0.57m/s (Figure 4.6e). For the ebb conditions the initial and smoothed DEM results consistently demonstrate that flows were predominantly toward the northwest quadrant, with a wide range of current velocities in all directions (Figure 4.6a -4.6j). However, in most instances the current velocities of the lower quality DEMs are mostly comparable to the initial values (Figure 4.6a -4.6j). Also, the increase in occurrence of higher velocities with successive smoothings is less pronounced; opposite of flow conditions. In summary, with 10 and 17 there is a nominal effect on flood and ebb velocities, while 50 and 100 produced stronger corresponding flow toward the southwest and northeast. This effect is more pronounced during flood than during ebb. For example, the peak flood velocity after 100 is 0.54m/s or 32% stronger than the peak ebb velocity of 0.36m/s."}, {"section_title": "DEM SMOOTHING AND MESO SCALE CIRCULATION", "text": "The effect of smoothing on meso scale fluxes was evaluated by monitoring changes in net water volume transport over one spring tidal cycle across a set of transects. We focus on the spring tide response because of the fuller inundation of the landscape. The results are reported in Table 4 as percentages of the initial simulations, with positive and negative values indicating net outward and inward flow, respectively (Table 4.4 and Figure 4.2). The net transport over Transect 1a increases by 4% after 10 and 6% after the 17 (Table 4.4). However, for 50 and 100 net flow decreased by 28% and by 35%, respectively. The response was similar for Transect 1b, with an initial increase of 5% after 10 and a decrease of 3% after 17 (Table 4.4) followed by a 16% after 50 and 66% after 100. Despite these slight to moderate differences, in all cases the net direction of flow was positive and away from the marsh interior (Table 4.4 and Figure 4.2) The initial net transport at Transects 2a -d is positive (Table 4. However, the net flow direction is consistently outward for all smoothings. The Transect 2 response is more variable. Net flux declines after the first two intervals, but is 5 -7 times greater with 50 and 100. These differences indicate counter clockwise rotational flow for 10 and 17, and clockwise rotation with 50 and 100. Figure 4.7 shows the dye distribution resulting from the initial DEM. At two hours before high tide the dye remains in the inner marsh with the front forming a half \"oval\" shape of higher concentrations open to the northwest, centered on Groves Creek (Figure 4.7a). Also, very little dye remains in the main subtidal channel, and most is on the dissected marsh. However, this general view is interrupted by two features; one is a high concentration area in the dissected marsh, and another is a low concentration front along the marsh platform north of and parallel to Groves Creek. Also, pockets of high and low concentration are distributed throughout (Figure 4.7a)."}, {"section_title": "DEM SMOOTHING AND DYE CIRCULATION OVER THE BASIN", "text": "At two hours after high tide the dye is much more dilute; less than half the flood values (Figure 4 The series of difference maps show that the extent of surplus values becomes progressively confined closer to the subtidal system, and the patchiness substantially decreases (Figure 4.8). This means that each smoothing gives rise to the presence of more concentrated dye in the subtidal system, and the dye distribution becomes more uniform. The maximum extent of dye is also noteworthy. For example, the initial results show dye reaching the heads of many adjoining creek systems that are oriented away from the marsh interior. In particular, for the initial, 10 and 17 smoothings highly concentrated dye reaches the \"headwater\" areas of Hannah's Creek and adjoining systems, whereas the subsequent smoothings lead to lower concentrations reaching the same area (Figure 4.8). Hence, the smoothings of 50 and 100 essentially shut down the delivery of highly concentrated dye to the intertidal creeks that during ebb can be expected to \"short-circuit\" the flow system and return marsh water directly to the "}, {"section_title": "TRACER RESIDENCE TIME", "text": "Simulations of residence times (Rt) at various locations range from 1.02 day -1.20 day (Table 4.5). At Stations 1 and 2 the Rt values of 1.18 day and 1.20 day, respectively, are longer than other stations because these sites are \"upstream\" of the release point (Table 4.5). However, these high values are artifacts of the experimental design, e.g. introduction of dye on rising tide causes dye to move away from these stations, toward others. Consequently, excluding these stations gives a maximum of 1.14 day. Station 7 is located in the low marsh and has the lowest Rt of 1.02 day. All other stations that, by their location, represent the average marsh interior conditions have a Rt of 1.07 day -1.14 day. Overall, the smoothings give a consistent Rt response. In going from the initial to the 10 and then to the 17 the values systematically decline at all stations (Table 4.5). But from 17 to 50 to 100 Rt increases. Therefore, the first two smoothings appear to promote dye transfer. On the other hand, for 50 and 100 the dye dispersal is inhibited and retained in the system over a longer time. In addition, the range of Rt values between the eight stations increases with smoothing (Table 4. The gradual approach to topographic smoothing progressively reduces the drainage density by approximately 50% with each iteration, and it decreases the number and extent of intertidal creeks. In particular, after the 10 and 17 smoothings the drainage density is significantly reduced and the surface is nearly devoid of intertidal creeks. Moreover, at 50 and 100 the hydraulic connections that are higher in the tidal framework and between the marsh interior and the Wilmington River are broken; hence, connectivity is lost. Together, these structural changes in the marsh landscape allow us to infer from our results the role of intertidal creeks and hydraulic connectivity in simulating overmarsh circulation. Overall, the 10 and 17 smoothings did not noticeably impact overmarsh circulation despite the removal of most intertidal creeks. Further, simulations signifigantly diverge from the initial high quality DEM results once the connectivity is lost with the 50 and 100 smoothing. Hence, the hydraulic connectivity of the basin greatly influences overmarsh circulation much more than the intertidal creek networks. The loss of connectivity from the 50 and 100 smoothings also produced a system wide switch from ebb to flood dominance. For instance, at the basin scale the initial DEM has a free surface slope over the eastern marsh edge that is greater during ebb than flood, and we take this to represent ebb dominant conditions. At 10 and 17, the ebb dominant conditions persist, while 50 and 100 produces a westward flood slope that exceeds the slope during ebb, indicating flood dominance (Table 4.3). At the macro scale peak ebb currents at 2hours after high tide are initially greater than peak flood currents, and this is also true after 10 and 17. However, peak flood velocity exceeds peak ebb flow by 32% with the greater smoothing. Moreover, the meso scale assessment counterclockwise rotational flow for initial, 10 and 17 simulations, while the 50 and 100 smoothings give rise to clockwise rotational flow. Taken together these findings suggest that the flood-ebb dominance of a basin is in part related to geomorphic structure and in particular the hydraulic connectivity of the landscape, or opportunities for short circuiting. This is important because spurious simulation results arising from variable DEM quality will likely impact studies of system morphodynamics. For example, sediment flux is intrinsically related to tidal asymmetry through flood or ebb transport, and the development of flood or ebb dominant bedforms (Aubrey, 1986;Van de Kreeke and Robaczewska, 1993;Freidrichs et al., 1998). Also, flood dominant flows tend to have higher suspended sediment concentration near the creek/marsh boundary, and thereby increase the sediment supply to the marsh; and marsh accretion (Stevenson et al., 1988;Leonard et al., 1995b). Hence, flood dominance at this salt marsh would likely result in higher levels of marsh accretion and increased organic matter preservation (Stevenson et al., 1988). Much more information on the smoothing effects on overmarsh circulation can be gleaned by assessing dye dispersal. Maps of concentration difference at 2hrs before high tide indicate that interval 10 and 17 slightly enhanced the dye dispersal to the marsh interior during flood, and higher concentrations exiting the system via Hannah's Creek during ebb. However, at 50 and 100 there is much less dispersal during flood, and higher concentrations exiting through Groves Creek rather than Hannah's Creek. Together, these observations suggest that dye distribution, and ultimately the fate of suspended particlate matter is largely influenced by larger scale hydraulic connectivity higher up in the tidal framework, and to a lesser extent the small intertidal creek networks. This finding contradicts  who speculated that salt marsh circulation is highly sensitive to the effect of smaller \"capillary\" creeks or intertidal creeks less than about 1m in width and depth. They attributed their limited tracer dispersal during flood and dye retention in the marsh interior during ebb to the exclusion of small scale intertidal creeks from their DEM. Another main finding of this work is that the residence time of water, and hence nutrients, larvae, and other suspended material vary as a function of the basin geomorphic structure. Initially, the Rt of the Groves Creek basin is about 1 day. After 10 and 17, there is a systematic decrease in Rt throughout the basin, while at 50 and 100 the Rt increases at all sites and is highly variable. From a geomorphic perspective, these results indicate that the flushing processes of a salt marsh with fewer intertidal creeks and lower drainage density are faster, whereas the flushing efficiency of a basin closed off and disconnected from the larger subtidal system is much lower. Therefore, we propose that the range of Rt values for any given salt marsh basin is set by the geomorphic structure of the landscape. Ultimately, we have shown that the small intertidal creek networks are not necessarily the most important feature for accurate simulation of overmarsh flow. Rather, it is the hydraulic connectivity that facilitates direct links between the marsh interior and the larger subtidal system. Hence, we propose that the DEM quality be sufficient of capturing the hydraulic connectivity across the marsh, but not necessarily the smallest creeks. At this study site a DEM resolution of 17m is sufficient for accurate representation of flows."}, {"section_title": "SUMMARY", "text": "This dissertation highlights the complexity in overmarsh circulation across various spatial and temporal scales that arise from the submergence/emergence of subtle salt marsh topography. It also provides a deeper insight into the geomorphic controls on flow processes in intertidal landscapes. In the first part of this work GPS and lidar salt marsh DEMs were compared to evaluate how well the remote sensing technology captures the salt marsh topography. Results show that 78% of the lidar elevations were within the accepted range of accuracy and, therefore, lidar appears to be a robust tool for measuring salt marsh topography. However, the spatial arrangement of elevation differences reveals that the lidar DEM poorly represents the subtle geomorphic structure of the marsh landscape. Therefore, for studies of flow processes in salt marshes lidar surveys should be supplemented with additional elevation data. In the second part of this work, a high precision, high resolution GPS DEM is used for hydrodynamic simulations of overmarsh flow and dye circulation using Delft3D. The simulation results are robust and in most cases produced a model efficiency greater than 0.90. This is primarily due to the high quality salt marsh DEM and the range and quality of field data for calibration and validation. Dye transport and circulation reveal strong complexity with the temporal evolution of inundation, and drainage at water levels within 0.2m of the mean platform elevation. Moreover, over the full five-day simulation interval we found that 53% of the dye mass exited the system at the eastern marsh edge However, smoothing with a 50m x 50m window reveals a threshold response that is coincident with the removal of short-circuiting pathways between the marsh interior and the larger subtidal system. These findings reveal that small intertidal creeks have a minor role in overmarsh circulation, while the presence of short-circuiting flowpaths dictates circulation for 53% of the water entering the basin. Hence, for accurate simulations of overmarsh flow the DEM must account for the hydraulic connectivity of the basin to the surrounding subtidal system, but not necessarily the smaller intertidal creeks and creek networks. For the Groves Creek salt marsh, a topographic resolution of 17m or less is sufficient."}]
