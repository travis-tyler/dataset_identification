[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "ABSTRACT.-Using standardized mist-net captures collected over a 32-year period , we examined changes in the capture rates of passerines recorded in coastal Massachusetts during fall (78 species) and spring (72 species) migration. Capture rates of 45 species of fall migrants (58%) declined significantly between early (1970)(1971)(1972)(1973)(1974)(1975)(1976)(1977)(1978)(1979)(1980)(1981)(1982)(1983)(1984)(1985) and late (1986)(1987)(1988)(1989)(1990)(1991)(1992)(1993)(1994)(1995)(1996)(1997)(1998)(1999)(2000)(2001) years of the study; 36 species of spring migrants (50%) showed significant declines. Only Carolina Wren (Thryothorus ludovicianus), Tufted Titmouse (Baeolophus bicolor), Northern Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis), and Orchard Oriole (Icterus spurius) showed significant increases during spring migration; fall sampling indicated that Carolina Wren, Tufted Titmouse, Black-throated Blue Warbler (Dendroica caerulescens), and Northern Cardinal had significantly higher capture rates. Of 37 species included in the migration monitoring data but not reliably represented by Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) data in any of the northeastern physiographic strata, 23 (62%) showed significant declines at Manomet during at least one of the two migration periods. There were significant correlations in percent changes in migrant capture rates between fall and spring. BBS trends reported from the southern New England and northern New England physiographic strata were correlated with changes in migrant capture rates. However, there were also inconsistencies between results obtained by the two monitoring approaches, suggesting that factors in addition to actual changes in breeding populations may be reflected in the migration capture data."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "Monitoring passerine population changes through counts collected along migratory routes has been attempted often (Hussell 1981 , Gauthreaux 1992 , Hagan et al. 1992 , Hussell et al. 1992 , Peach et al. 1998 , Ballard et al. 2003 ) despite a variety of issues that sometimes make the results of such studies difficult to interpret. In particular, detecting true changes in breeding populations may be confounded by weather effects that produce dramatic differences among years in the numbers of a particular species that appears during migration at a specific site (Gauthreaux 1971 , Moore and Simons 1992 , Dunn and Hussell 1995 ; while ''fallouts'' may provide exciting birding conditions, they also underscore the substantial stochastic element associated with any migration monitoring scheme. Habitat changes at a migration site also may cause apparent shifts in species' abundances that are unrelated to true population levels (Remsen and Good 1996) . Furthermore, the specific breeding populations actually represented by samples of migrants are almost always unknown (Dunn and Hussell 1995) , and conceivably may vary from year-to-year at a particular migration site under the influence of differing weather conditions. Thus, there is lit-tle doubt, as some have pointed out (Butcher et al. 1993 , Sauer 1993 , Remsen and Good 1996 , that monitoring changes in breeding populations through counts of migrants obtained by mist-net captures is risky business.\nStill, most long-term field observers will quickly counter that something is happening to the numbers of migrating land birds in eastern North America (Robbins et al. 1989 , Terborgh 1989 , Askins et al. 1990 , and that these perceived changes are not easily discounted simply by the effects of weather variations or local habitat change. In fact, although shortterm fluctuations in numbers of migrants recorded at a site may be completely meaningless, we contend that studies of longer duration-despite their inherent complicationsmay yet help to elucidate true population changes simply by virtue of their long-term perspective.\nIn this paper we present results, to date, of one of North America's longest migration monitoring efforts, conducted at Manomet Center for Conservation Sciences (formerly Manomet Bird Observatory, MBO) from the late 1960s to the present. A preliminary analysis of some of these data was presented by Hagan et al. (1992) ; herein, we extend the scope of this earlier work in terms of years, seasons, and species included. For 78 species in fall and 72 species in spring we examine, for the 32-year period 1970-2001, (a) changes in the numbers of individuals captured at Manomet's banding station in coastal Massachusetts, and (b) similarities in patterns of annual fluctuations of capture rates among species. We also compare changes in capture rates with estimates of population trends obtained through a very different type of monitoring study, the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS), which also has operated over this extensive time period (Robbins et al. 1986 , Sauer 1993 , Sauer et al. 2001 )."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": "Manomet Center for Conservation Sciences, located on the western side of Cape Cod Bay, Plymouth County, Massachusetts (41\u040a 50\u0408 N, 70\u040a 30\u0408 W), is characterized by brushy, second-growth deciduous woodland, bordered on the east and south by a steep, eroding coastal bluff and on the west and north by brushy wetlands. Dominant tree species on the 7-ha plot include black cherry (Prunus serotina), shadbush (Amelanchier sp.), red maple (Acer rubrum), white oak (Quercus alba), and pitch pine (Pinus rigida). Common catbrier (Smilax rotundifolia), bayberry (Myrica pensylvanica), staghorn sumac (Rhus typhina), honeysuckle (Lonicera morrowi), arrowwood (Viburnum recognitum), and poison ivy (Toxicodendron radicans) are principal understory species.\nHabitat succession was, for the most part, unchecked during the study period, but the site's location on an exposed coastal bluff resulted in annual natural ''pruning'' by harsh winter storms that probably reduced the degree of change in habitat structure over time. Small fields and grassland borders within the study site are mowed routinely. Historic photos of the area indicate that during the early 1920s most of the study area consisted of open sheep pastures, but by the time banding operations were begun in 1966 the site had already acquired the brushy, second-growth condition that characterizes it today. An individual black cherry tree was photographed in 1966, with a bander for height comparison, in a net lane about 10 m inland from the ocean bluff. By 2003, the tree had grown an estimated 25% in height, probably typical for the exposed coastal net lanes.\nFrom 45 to 50 nylon mist nets (12 m long, 2.6 m high, 4 panels, 36 mm extended mesh) were operated annually from 1970 to 2001, inclusive; because of less complete coverage and imprecise records regarding capture effort expended during the first 4 years of the observatory's existence (1966) (1967) (1968) (1969) , we excluded these years from analysis. Nets were kept at fixed locations throughout the study. Opening and closing times of nets were recorded and used for calculating daily capture effort (Robbins 1968) ; except for closures during adverse weather conditions, generally nets were operated from 0.5 hr prior to sunrise to 0.5 hr after sunset. Thus, 50 nets open for 12 hr equals 600 net hr. Sampling was conducted 5-7 days per week during spring (15 April-15 June) and fall (15 August-15 November) migration.\nDuring the study period, 205,454 individuals of 159 species were banded. Records used in this analysis were selected from the overall database using criteria described be-low. Only passerines are considered here; scientific names and abbreviation codes for species referenced in the text are provided in the Appendix. Willow and Alder flycatchers were combined, as were Bicknell's and Graycheeked thrushes. Palm Warbler races were treated separately as ''Yellow'' and ''Western'' Palm warblers. Captures of hybrid ''Brewster's'' (n \u03ed 3) and ''Lawrence's'' (n \u03ed 2) warblers were counted as Blue-winged Warblers. Repeat captures were eliminated. Locally breeding birds, identified on the basis of well-developed brood patches or cloacal protuberances, were eliminated, as were spring captures of hatching-year (HY) individuals. Species that were captured, by season, in fewer than 15 of the 32 years, were eliminated.\nFor each species, by season, migration windows were calculated as falling between the 1 st and 99 th percentiles of all capture dates across all years; any records outside these windows were excluded. These cutoff values are provided in the Appendix. For example, during fall migration, 98% of all captures of American Redstarts occurred from 17 August to 12 October. Any banding activity that took place within this window was considered to represent a legitimate sampling day for this species; days that yielded no redstart captures, but on which nets were open, contributed a value of zero to the overall calculation of capture rate. Any redstart captures that occurred before 17 August or after 12 October were excluded.\nFor each species (by year and season), we calculated a mean capture rate weighted by the number of hours of mist netting that occurred on each contributing date. That is, in calculating mean seasonal and annual capture rates for a species, the rate obtained on a day when nets were open for 400 net hr was given more emphasis than a rate obtained on a day when only 10 net hr of sampling took place. We used Wilcoxon 2-sample tests to examine long-term trends by testing (for each species, by season) the hypothesis that mean capture rates were equal between Early (1970 Early ( -1985 and Late (1986 Late ( -2001 years of the study.\nSpearman rank correlations were used to assess concordance between each species' fall and spring capture rates, and between the percent change in mean capture rates (Early versus Late) for each species and the population trends provided by BBS data (Sauer et al. 2001) . These authors commendably cautioned that ''Small sample sizes, low relative abundance on survey routes, imprecise trends, and missing data all can compromise BBS results. Often, users do not take these problems into account when viewing BBS results, and use the results inappropriately.'' When we refer to BBS trends in this paper, we conservatively include only instances where the BBS ''Regional Credibility Measure'' was in the bestsampled, ''blue'' category. That is, BBS trends considered by Sauer et al. (2001) to include ''important deficiencies'' (red) and ''deficiencies'' (yellow) were not used in the correlation analyses.\nPresentation of graphs showing changes in capture rates for each species and season combination in this study would require 150 individual figures. Although obviously beyond the space limitations of this publication, these results are provided online at www. manomet.org. Here, in order to visually summarize major patterns of variation within this large set of data, we calculated 3-year moving averages based on annual mean capture rates, then standardized each of these values as a percent of the maximum rate encountered for each species among all years (by season). Next, we used Ward's minimum variance clustering approach, as implemented by JMP statistical software (SAS Institute, Inc. 2001) , to identify, for each season, an arbitrary six groups of species that exhibited similar yearto-year fluctuations in capture rates. Finally, we plotted means and standard errors, calculated from the moving averages for species belonging to each of these clusters."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": "Of 72 species captured during spring migration, 60 (83%) had lower mean capture rates during 1986-2001 than during 1970-1985 (Table 1) . These declines were significant (P \u03fd 0.05) in 36 species. Twelve species showed higher capture rates during 1986-2001 than during 1970-1985 ; in four of these (Carolina Wren, Tufted Titmouse, Northern Cardinal, and Orchard Oriole), the increases from Early to Late sampling periods were significant (P \u03fd 0.01).\nDuring fall migration, 69 of 78 species (1970) (1971) (1972) (1973) (1974) (1975) (1976) (1977) (1978) (1979) (1980) (1981) (1982) (1983) (1984) (1985) and Late (1986 Late ( -2001 a Based on weighted means of capture rates, by year and season (n \u03ed 16 in both Early and Late periods). % Change \u03ed (Late \u03ea Early)/Early \u03eb 100.

(88%) had lower capture rates during Late years of the study than during Early years (Table 1); these differences were significant (P \u03fd 0.05) in 45 species. Nine species had higher capture rates during 1986-2001 than during 1970-1985 ; in four of these (Carolina Wren, Tufted Titmouse, Black-throated Blue Warbler, and Northern Cardinal), the differences were significant (P \u03fd 0.05).\nPercent changes in mean capture rates from Early to Late years of the study were positively correlated between spring and fall migrations (Rho \u03ed 0.55, P \u03fd 0.001, n \u03ed 63 species; Fig. 1 ). Exclusion of three outliers (Carolina Wren, Tufted Titmouse, and Northern Cardinal) that showed dramatic increases in capture rates during both migration periods did not substantially alter the strength of the observed correlation (Rho \u03ed 0.48, P \u03fd 0.001, n \u03ed 60 species). There were no species that showed significant increases in capture rate during one season and significant decreases in the other.\nBecause of uncertainty regarding the location of breeding populations represented by migrants in coastal Massachusetts, we compared our results with BBS trends from three physiographic regions (southern New England, northern New England, and eastern Spruce-Hardwoods) that we considered the most likely sources of the majority of migrants observed at Manomet (Fig. 2) . Captures of spring migrants were significantly (P \u03fd 0.05) and positively correlated with BBS trends from northern New England; during fall migration, we found significant positive correlations between capture rates and BBS trends from both southern and northern New England physiographic strata (Table 2) . Four species that breed at high latitudes or high elevations [Gray-cheeked/Bicknell's Thrush, Palm Warbler (western), American Tree Sparrow, and White-crowned Sparrow] were represented in the migration monitoring data but not by BBS analyses; all of these species showed significantly declining capture rates (P \u03fd 0.05) between Early and Late periods of the study. Thirty-three species represented in the migration monitoring data were considered by Sauer et al. (2001) to be represented unreliably by BBS data in any of the northeastern physiographic strata ( showed significant declines at Manomet during at least one of the two migration periods, while capture rates of 3 (Tufted Titmouse, Carolina Wren, and Orchard Oriole) significantly increased during fall and spring migrations (Table 1) .\nApparent inconsistencies between trends based on migration captures at Manomet and BBS data were greatest for the eastern Spruce-Hardwoods stratum and least for the southern New England stratum. This pattern was true during both spring (Fig. 3) and fall (Fig. 4 ) migration periods. Spring migration captures indicated significant (P \u03fd 0.05) declines in three species for which BBS analyses found significant increases: Red-eyed Vireo (eastern Spruce-Hardwoods), Ovenbird (northern New England), and Gray Catbird (southern New England). Fall migration captures significantly declined in four species whereas BBS analyses showed significant increases: Red-eyed Vireo and Yellow-rumped (Myrtle) Warbler (eastern Spruce-Hardwoods), Yellow-bellied Flycatcher and Yellow-rumped (Myrtle) Warbler (northern New England), and Gray Catbird (southern New England).\nFor each migration period, cluster analysis was used to identify an arbitrary six groups of species that shared general patterns of change in capture rates across years (Figs. 5 and 6 ). This approach allowed us to summarize trend data visually for a large number of species. However, we note that similarities in capture rates among members of a group do not necessarily mean that shared trends were caused by similar proximate factors. In some cases cluster membership may, in fact, reflect the influence of shared ecology. For example, FIG. 3 . Comparison of trends in capture rate based on spring migration monitoring at Manomet relative to trends derived from BBS data (Sauer et al. 2001) in (A) spruce-hardwoods, (B) northern New England, and (C) southern New England physiographic strata. ''DE-CLINE-significant,'' P \u03fd 0.05; ''Decline,'' P \u0546 0.05; ''INCREASE-significant,'' P \u03fd 0.05; ''Increase,'' P \u0546 0.05. For example, of 13 species showing significant declines according to BBS data from southern New England, 70% showed significant declines in Manomet capture rates, and 20% showed declines in Manomet capture rates that were not statistically significant. (Fig. 6F) ; many, if not all, of these species likely responded to a widespread outbreak of spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumerifana Clem.) in eastern North America during this time period (Hagan et al. 1992) . Carolina Wren and Northern Cardinal, two species known to have shown dramatic regional population increases during the last decades (Ha- gan et al. 1992), were grouped together during both spring (Fig. 5E ) and fall (Fig. 6C ) migrations.\nWe speculate that at least some of the clustering results (and, therefore, underlying trend patterns) may reflect local weather conditions that would have influenced capture rates of species with similar migration periods. There were significant differences among mean migration dates for each of the six clusters ( Fig.  7 ; Wilcoxon rank sum test; spring: 2 \u03ed 19.34, df \u03ed 5, P \u03ed 0.002; fall: 2 \u03ed 16.12, df \u03ed 5, P \u03ed 0.007). During spring, most species assigned to clusters A and D (Fig. 5A, D) were relatively early migrants, with mean migration dates of 7 May (SE \u03ed 4.5 days) and 3 May (SE \u03ed 3.4 days), respectively; both of these groups showed somewhat elevated capture rates during the mid to late 1980s, possibly suggesting that during several years in this time period weather conditions caused largerthan-normal numbers of these species to be present in coastal Massachusetts. Similarly, most species assigned to fall cluster A (Fig.  6A) were relatively late migrants, with a mean migration date of 9 October (SE \u03ed 3.3 days); the relatively high capture rates that characterized this group during the early 1970s may have reflected local weather conditions that affected any species with a peak migration period in early October.\nNonetheless, we hesitate to try and provide further explanations for the species ''memberships'' in each of these groupings. Instead, we prefer to emphasize a more general perspective, noting that only one of the six trend plots from each migration period (spring: Fig. 5E ; fall: Fig. 6C ) showed obvious increases in capture rates. Four of the plots from each migration period (spring: Fig. 5B -D, F; fall: Fig.  6A -B, E-F) showed decreasing trends in capture rates. One plot from each migration period was characterized by peak capture rates during the early to mid 1980s, with comparably low rates before and after this time period (spring: Fig. 5A ; fall: Fig. 6D )."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "The Breeding Bird Survey is widely recognized as a primary source of information regarding conservation priorities for North American birds (Geissler and Noon 1981 , Butcher et al. 1993 , Smith et al. 1993 , James et al. 1996 , Carter et al. 2000 , yet relatively few studies have attempted to validate its conclusions via independent, alternative monitoring schemes. Hussell et al. (1992) compared a migration index from 1961 to 1988 at Long Point, Ontario with BBS trends in that province and obtained positive correlations, as did Francis and Hussell (1998) in Ontario. Other multiple-year comparisons with BBS data have included intensive counts in Quebec (Jobin et al. 1996) and migration monitoring at Southeast Farallon Island, California (Pyle et al. 1994 ) and at Point Reyes, California (Ballard et al. 2003) . In this paper we present results from a long-term study based on standardized mist-net capture efforts during fall and spring migrations in coastal Massachusetts, and compare these data with estimates of population trends obtained by Sauer et al. (2001) in their analysis of BBS data.\nAt first glance it would appear that there is good agreement between our results and BBS analyses. There were strong correlations be- tween population trends observed in each of the three BBS strata considered here and changes in Manomet capture rates between 1970-1985 and 1986-2001 , suggesting that both methods do, in fact, reflect changes in regional breeding populations. For example, Least Flycatcher was the only species to decline significantly in all three northeastern BBS strata, and it showed a significant decline in capture rate during fall at Manomet. Of 10 species for which significant declines were noted in two of three northeastern BBS strata, we found significant declines in capture rates during at least one of the two migration seasons for 7 (Eastern Kingbird, Wood Thrush, Common Yellowthroat, Eastern Towhee, Field Sparrow, White-throated Sparrow, and Purple Finch); 2 of the other species (Eastern WoodPewee and Common Grackle) declined nonsignificantly at Manomet, while Great Crested Flycatcher showed a non-significant increase based on migration data. Of 23 species for which the BBS showed significant population declines in at least one of the three physiographic strata considered here, 18 (78%) also showed significant declines in capture rates during spring and/or fall migration.\nYet the situation is more complex than these comparisons might suggest. In many cases our study failed to detect increasing population trends indicated by the BBS. Of 16 species shown by Sauer et al. (2001) to have had significant increases in at least one of the physiographic strata considered here, we found significantly increased capture rates in only 1 (Northern Cardinal). Furthermore, we observed significant declines in capture rates during spring and/or fall migration for five species found by the BBS to be exhibiting significant population increases in at least one of the three physiographic strata [Yellow-bellied Flycatcher, Red-eyed Vireo, Gray Catbird, Yellow-rumped (Myrtle) Warbler, and Ovenbird].\nIn our study we found significantly declining capture rates during one or both migration periods in 54 of 87 species (62%), but only 5 species (6%) showed significant increases. Among the 37 of these species for which reliable BBS results were available from at least one of the northeast's physiographic strata, Sauer et al. (2001) found significant declines in 22 cases (59%) and significant increases in 15 (41%); Great Crested Flycatcher and Gray Catbird showed opposite significant trends in different physiographic strata. These contrasts suggest that factors in addition to changes in breeding populations may be confounding the relationship with capture rates observed during migration.\nWe especially note that the patterns we describe here could have emerged if captures of most species we sampled during migration were somehow being reduced, over time, by factors unrelated to actual changes in breeding populations. For example, long-term changes in climate conceivably could cause shifts in regional weather patterns that, in turn, might systematically affect the number of migrants appearing in coastal Massachusetts (Moore et al. 1993 ). However, we are not aware of any evidence of long-term increases in migration captures at established banding operations east of the Mississippi that might be expected if actual migration patterns were changing. Or, as the vegetation at Manomet has matured since 1970, some species of migrants may now move through the study area at heights where they simply avoid making contact with the nets (2.6 m in height) (Remsen and Good 1996) ; species that would continue to be ac-tive primarily within 3 m of the ground, even in the presence of higher canopy cover, might be avoiding the site because of its generally more forested aspect (Moore et al. 1993) .\nConversely, the BBS results may themselves be subject to error due to the effects of roadside bias (Temple and Wiens 1989, Keller and Fuller 1995) or short count period (Welsh 1995 , Jobin et al. 1996 ; thus; the trend estimates by Sauer et al. (2001) may not necessarily provide a ''gold standard'' by which to validate Manomet's migration count results. It is also quite possible that a species could be increasing in one BBS stratum and decreasing in another, or showing conflicting trends within different regions of a single stratum-any of which could confuse the relationship between trends shown by the BBS and migration monitoring data sets. One of the three BBS strata considered here, the eastern SpruceHardwood forest, is so large (353,538 km 2 ; Rosenberg and Hodgman 2000) that presentation of a single trend to represent this entire area seems fraught with uncertainty at least equal to our lack of knowledge about the detailed breeding locations of migrants passing through Manomet.\nAt this point we have no way of further assessing these possible explanations. Certainly capture rates of migrants at Manomet during spring and fall have, in many cases, changed substantially from 1970 to 2001, and the vast majority of these changes have been declines. Migration count data from other studies also indicate long-term declines in New England birds; for example, Hill and Hagan (1991) found that spring surveys of 26 Neotropical migrants in Middlesex and Essex counties of Massachusetts declined, on average, nearly 1% per year from 1954 to 1987. Personal comments from several banders familiar with the location for 30\u03e9 years all indicate that there are fewer birds in recent years at Manomet and in New England generally.\nMany of the declines documented at Manomet coincide with declines in breeding populations reported by the most reliable BBS data. Nonetheless, there are some apparent inconsistencies between results of the two analyses that we cannot explain. It appears likely that a combination of factors have influenced the number of migrants captured at Manomet since 1970. We believe, however, that the preponderance of data suggests long-term population declines in a wide variety of both Neotropical and shorter-distance migrants that greatly exceed the few increases that have been observed."}, {"section_title": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "It is impossible for us to name all of the contributors to this project, many of whom have given their time faithfully since the late 1960s.
