It does this primarily by designating areas as Habitat Areas of Particular Concern (HAPC) or as marine reserves. Those areas designated as HAPCs 1 in the early 1980s (1982) all contain significant coral communities (Figure 1). HAPC designation at that time afforded these areas protection from coral harvest and the use of fishing gear that could damage coral communities, including bottom longlines, traps, pots, bottom trawls, dredges, and toxic chemicals. While four other sites were designated as HAPCs in the Gulf of Mexico Essential Fish Habitat Amendment (GMFMC 1998), none of these was provided with similar protection. Fundamental to the study and management of natural resources in Habitat Areas of Particular Concern is the development of objective, systematic, and intuitively understandable maps. General geomorphologic and habitat maps already exist for some parts of the Flower Gardens, the Oculina Banks (Scanlon et al. 1999, Koenig et al. 2000 In press), and the Florida Middle Grounds (BLM 1981, Mallinson 2000. Most other areas in the Gulf of Mexico have neither the habitat maps nor adequate descriptions of the benthic geomorphology, the basis for developing habitat maps. From 1978 to 1980, the Mineral Management Service sponsored seven cruises to the area designed in part to integrate geophysical mapping with biological and chemical sampling. The primary biological objectives were to determine whether the Florida Middle Ground should be designated as a HAPC, and to devise cost effective monitoring approaches that could moderate decision making relative to oil and gas exploration (BLM 1981). The study included, among other things, descriptions of the benthic cover (Grimm andHopkins 1977, BLM 1981) and the associated fish fauna (Clarke 1986). Using the BLM (1981) study as a guide, our intent was to establish a status and trends benthic habitat and fish fauna monitoring program for the Florida Middle Grounds using ROVvideo transects and wet-diving sampling. We also evaluated a number of other sites that included other types of habitat, including important commercial (hook and line) fishing sites. While this study is not nearly so intensive or comprehensive as the BLM study, we have supplied a survey of the basic habitat features and primary ichthyofauna that allows us to make a realistic comparison. Assessing habitat change is critical in an environment already experiencing heavy fishing pressure and likely to experience increased oil and gas exploration and other types of human-induced impacts, including ocean dumping (e.g., the Environmental Protection Agency recently approved permits to dump 500,000 gallons of phosphate waste across the west Florida shelf)."}, {"section_title": "7", "text": "1 Areas identified as HAPCs in the 1970s include the Flower Garden Banks in the western Gulf of Mexico (now the Flower Gardens National Marine Sanctuary), the Oculina Banks off the east coast of Florida (now expanded to 300 NM 2 and containing a 92 NM 2 experimental marine reserve), and The Florida Middle Grounds in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico."}, {"section_title": "Study Site", "text": "The northeastern Gulf of Mexico has the most extensive hardbottom habitat of the entire United States Atlantic coast (Parker Jr. et al. 1983), although most of the relief is less than one meter (m) in height. The highest and most estensive relief (> 2m) in less than 60 m water depths occurs within the Florida Middle Grounds (FMG), an area on the West Florida Shelf some 137 km off Florida's coast ( Figure 2). The FMG is unique in this part of the Gulf in having carbonate bank ledges rising as much as 15 m off the bottom, cresting at ~25 to 30 m below sea level ( Figure 3). The ledges form a broad carbonate platform simlar to Campeche Bank (Hine and Mullins 1983), developed from karst topography on the usually flat muddy and sandy bottom of the region (Brooks 1973, Pyle et al. 1974. The occurrence of this reef complex indicates paleoceanographic conditions in the eastern Gulf of Mexico that were significantly different from those that exist today. Rock outcrops like those that exist in the FMG typically form from undercut ledges representing previous sea-level stands. Brooks (1962) attributes the FMG relief to underlying Pleistocene reef structure, based on seismic data. More recent work by Mallinson (2000) suggests that the FMG is a relict (dead) coral-reef complex that has morphological similarities to modern patch-reef complexes over basement rock of Miocene age karst relief. The FMG reefs trend north-northwest parallel to the platform margin with at least five separate ridges separated by troughs or channels at shelf depths. Two ridges appear in the northern and central regions; a third ridge appears between these two ridges in the southern range, thereby narrowing the troughs between ridges. The third and fourth lower-relief ridges occur on the western margin of the area. The ridges consist of steep-sided flat-topped banks and numerous pinnacles with rock rubble and sediments collected at the bases. Sediments (carbonate, molluscan, and barnacle-derived sand) form sand waves in a pattern that suggests east and west tending currents. Further, the bank slopes are highly bioeroded and undercut, producing significant structural complexity. High local relief supports active reef growth, while the broad flat-topped banks are likely older, relict coral-reef/patch-reef complexes that have eroded to produce carbonate sands. It appears that organism abundance and diversity in the FMG are significantly influenced by the slope margins. From previous submersible work, we observed the water currents flow up and over the reef structures, often times creating strong currents that bring nutrients and plankton from deeper water, up the slope, and on to the horizontal platform. The physical conditions of the FMG provide opportunities for a unique community to exist in the region. The bank and pinnacle tops are covered with patchily-distributed relatively high relief communities of stony corals and octocorals , 1979, 1981a, Hopkins 1981c, b, Gittings et al. 1992 typical of deep Caribbean reefs, with associated invertebrate and fish assemblages indicative of an impoverished coral reef fauna (Grimm andHopkins 1977, Rezak et al. 1985). The region represents the northernmost extent of coral communities in the United States. Historically, Millepora alcicornis (branching fire coral) dominated the biotically-derived benthic cover and relief, with a dense zooxanthelate gorgonian assemblage that was absent elsewhere in the northern Gulf of Mexico (Rezak et al. 1985), including the Flower Garden Banks in the northwestern Gulf (Hopkins 1981c), and an extraordinarly diverse sponge fauna (Austin and Jones 1974). Despite the diversity, Hopkins suggests that the region is under stress, based on coral growth that is upward rather than lateral, indicative of a system that is not flourishing. The set of circumstances allowing such a unique and diverse biota to exist in the FMG depends in large part on the physical features of the region. The FMG occurs on the mid-shelf, whereas most hardbottom areas occur at greater depths, associated with the shelf edge (Rezak et al. 1985, Phillips et al. 1990. It occurs in a temperate region where minimum winter seawater temperatures (16\u00b0 C) are marginal for many tropical marine organisms, and where hurricanes and tropical storms occur with some frequency, exposing organisms to significant storm surge (Austin andJones 1974, Sturges andBlaha 1976). However, its position on the mid-shelf provides an interesting juxtaposition between converging water masses: a lower salinity turbid coastal water mass and the intermittent outer shelf high salinity stable tropical water mass of the Loop Current. (The Loop Current has a northward intrusion along the West Florida Shelf in the spring and summer, although there is not a clear seasonality to it.) The convergence results in high water column productivity in the FMG (Bullock and Smith 1979). The presence of the Loop Current also provides a mechanism for the transport of more tropical species to the region. The biotic communities of the Florida Middle Grounds also may well depend on the Loop Current to transport larvae from the tropics for recolonization (Collins 1885, Moe 1963. The unique features of the Florida Middle Grounds have not gone unnoticed. Roughly 348 NM 2 of area between 28\u00b0 10' and 28\u00b0 45' N and 084\u00b000' and 084\u00b025' W is considered a habitat area of particular concern. This area is roughly 150 km south of the north Florida coast, and 160 km northwest of Tampa Bay (Figure 2). The boundaries of the HAPC capture the primary high-relief and live bottom features of the area. As with many unique marine habitats, fishers were the first to discover the FMG area because it was once an important red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus) fishing ground from as early as the 1880s (1976). It is still important today, but for other species. The fish assemblages are diverse. Smith (Clarke 1986) summarized and compared reef fishes throughout the northeastern Gulf of Mexico and found the FMG had two to three times the number of reef fish taxa as were observed at other hard bottoms areas. In 1978-1979, a quantitative survey of reef fishes was undertaken via SCUBA (Shipp et al. 1986), followed by a characterization of the fish assemblage conducted by submersible (1983). Economically important fish were studied at the FMG via standard fishing techniques, such as bottom longlines, handlines, and traps, by Tyler (1979) and the unique assemblages of sponge-dwelling fishes described by Livingston (Mumby and Harborne 1999)."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": "We used a systematic scheme of habitat classification (1977), but modified for our purposes. Our scheme relies on a geomorphologic framework for the evaluation of habitat function and allows spatial and temporal expansion of these studies throughout the rest of the Florida Middle Grounds. It also provides a basis for the scientific investigation of habitat function on national and international scales. To wit, we supplied this same protocol to the National Geographic's Sustainable Seas Expedition in 2001 so that archived video records from these geo-referenced data throughout the Gulf of Mexico would be comparable. We used a combination of maps to form a base map for our studies, including: (1) historical study-site maps from Grimm and Hopkins (NGDC 2003); (2) three second gridded bathymetry data for the entire HAPC from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) hydrographic sounding database (Krebs 1999); (3) high-resolution multibeam bathymetric surveys of 42 NM 2 (129 km 2, roughly between latitudes 28\u00b0 32' N and 28\u00b0 37' N) (Mallinson 2000). We used these data to estimate the proportion of bottom area by depth range (Table 1, Figure  3). We evaluated 12 sites, including 6 sites previously visited by Hopkins et al in the 1970s 2 and several additional sites chosen specifically for this study. The science team consisted of ten scientific divers, an ROV operator, and two data managers. We evaluated all sites for physical and biological habitat features using digital video and still underwater images taken by remotely operating vehicle (ROV) ( Table 2) and SCUBA (Nitrox) divers (Table 3) onboard a chartered vessel (20 m) ( Figure 4). The biological communities of algae, sessile invertebrates, and fishes were characterized and classified using a systematic hierarchical clustering technique (Aronson et al. 1994). It includes percent cover McField 2001, Jaap et al. 2003), density of dominant sessile species, taxonomic composition to the lowest determinable taxon, taxonomic richness, other taxonomic diversity measures to the lowest determinable taxon, and spatial pattern of dominant species (i.e., random, regular, or clumped). Our approach here was threefold: first, to conduct studies for direct comparison by duplicating the methods used by Hopkins et al. to the extent practicable; second, to conduct ROV transects to characterize greater portions of the historical sites; and three, to investigate as many additional sites as practicable during our time at sea. In all instances, we used strip (belt) transects. Strip transects (essentially long, thin quadrats), unlike square or round quadrats, cut across many variations or patches (habitat heterogeneity) in the habitat and thus increase precision. Multiple random transects were useful for density (number per unit area) determination and many other community measures."}, {"section_title": "ROV component:", "text": "The National Undersea Research Center (University of North Carolina, Wilmington) supplied the ROV (Phantom S2 mini-ROV) and ROV-operator for this cruise through a rapidresponse funding proposal submitted by one of us (Dennis, USFW). Two cameras mounted on the ROV allowed us to obtain both videographic (Sony color CCD video camera with 460+ lines of resolution, auto iris, 12:1 zoom, and auto/manual focus) and still images (Insite-Tritech Scorpio digital still camera, TTL strobe, PC control, 3.34 megapixel CCD, 4X zoom). Both cameras had parallel-beam lasers set 10 cm apart to provide scale and to measure organisms. Both cameras could be rotated from forward-looking to downward-looking positions. The forward-looking videos and still photos provided images for identifying species, relief, and zonation, and the down-looking images for determining percent cover by the various community components. ROV surveys consisted of quantitative strip (belt) transects within defined geomorphologic features, covering a greater area and more extensive relief than the SCUBA surveys do. The ROV maintained a near-bottom elevation of approximately 0.5 to 1.0 meter, moving at a speed of 0.5 m/s or less to ensure clear images (a shutter speed of 1/125 was found to stop blur caused by the ROV movement). Transect duration of two minutes provided transect lengths of at least 25 m and facilitated keeping a single transect within similar habitat. Five two-minute video transects were taken at each site. The video camera view setting on wide angle allowed coverage of about 1 m on either side of the ROV. A TRACKPOINT ultrashort baseline system provided accurate positioning (+/-5 m) of the ROV. The ship position was determined with differential GPS. The ship and the ROV position were logged each second throughout the dive with HYPACK software. Though most dives occurred during the day when ambient light and visibility (> 10 m) were good, the use of lights ensured the capture of correct colors that are crucial for accurate identification of many taxa. Four downward-looking digital still images taken before and after each transect helped characterize the benthic habitat. During each dive, discrete haphazard digital still photographs taken at the same viewing angle as the video camera provided higher resolution images for taxonomic identification and characterization of the epibiota. The sampling was not strictly random because of the discrete sampling of unusual taxa and economically important species. Videos taken of each dive in mini-DV format were analyzed in the laboratory. All data were duplicated, archived, and entered into a Geographical Information System (GIS) database. A viewer analyzed each tape in the laboratory, identifying all fish to the lowest taxon, enumerating the abundance of each species, and noting the location on the tape by time. Processing of the navigation data after each dive provided the distance traveled along the bottom, based on handrecorded start and stop locations for each transect. A software glitch on one dive did not allow position logging. Once obviously spurious readings were removed from the navigation data, a revised time and location dataset was established. This allows the position of every observation from video and still cameras to be determined from the time."}, {"section_title": "SCUBA component", "text": "SCUBA divers conducted detailed surveys on the reef top and reef slope, leaving broad surveys to the ROV. Two different SCUBA dive teams surveyed the sites. One team concentrated on benthic structure (geological and biogenic), while the other conducted surveys of the ichthyofauna. Both SCUBA teams assessed seven locations at depths ranging from 29 to 35 m, including five historical sites (FMG147, FMG247, FMG251, FMG151, FMG491), and two new sites (\"Goliath Grouper Rock\", and \"Fisherman's Ledge\") ( Figure 4). Bottom time was limited to about 30 minutes per dive because of depth and gas supply, especially on FMG 491, where less sampling was possible. The dive team assessing habitat conducted both strip transect sampling to determine benthic percent cover and quadrat sampling to determine densities of organisms within four major taxonomic groups (i.e., algae, sponges, scleractinian corals, octocorals), collecting voucher specimens as needed. At some sites, divers focused on broad scale surveys rather than quantitative survey to get a better understanding of the range of benthic communities. A single 50 m long reference transect line was set at each site within defined geomorphologic features running generally from the reef break back across the reef flats. Divers made multiple video transects along this line, covering an area roughly 25 m x 0.4 m, (\u224810 m 2 per transect, planar area). The camera used was a Sony TVR 900 three chip digital camera in a modified Amphibico Dive Buddy 2 housing (2004) with laser lights to keep the camera lens 40 cm from the reef surface. Individual specimens were photographed with a Nikon Coolpix camera in an underwater housing with an Ikelite 200 underwater strobe. The base transect was marked at 2 m intervals (3 m for sponges) to identify locations for quadrat surveys. Quadrat placement sites along the base transect line were randomly determined, but each quadrat was placed perpendicular to the baseline. Divers then counted the number of each type of organism within each quadrat, collecting voucher specimens as needed for identification, and sediment samples to determine benthic foraminiferan species. Algal specimens were preserved in 4% formalin in seawater, small specimens in 20 ml scintillation vials and large specimens in zip-loc bags. A list of selected specimens deposited in the National Museum of Natural History Herbarium collection appears in the appendix (Appendix A). Divers conducting fish surveys videographed four or five random strip transects along the reef flat and down the reef face, taking from 12 to 29 minutes of Hi-8 video (SONY Video Camera) footage at each site (Table 3). Video analysis occurred in the laboratory. The first occurrence of each species was recorded by tape time, as were any unusual or unique fish observations. Discrete digital images of reef fishes were also obtained from the epifaunal dive team. We follow Eschmeyer et al. (Nelson et al. 2004) for taxonomic names and Nelson et al. (Boesch 1977) for common names of fishes. All videos were used to develop a general descriptive summary of the habitat."}, {"section_title": "Statistical analyses", "text": "Analysis of community characteristics from epifaunal diver surveys includes determinations of percent cover, density of dominant sessile species, species composition, species richness and other species diversity measures, spatial pattern of dominant species (i.e., random, regular, or clumped). Habitat-structuring organisms classified as major taxa (e.g., gorgonian, sponge, algae)--or at finer taxonomic and morphological scales when possible-provided a means of characterizing and classifying habitat. We used Sorensen's similarity index to compare species composition of historical and recent samples from major taxa (algae, octocorals, stony corals, and fishes) except sponges. The taxonomy of the historical sponge samples was not clear enough to make meaningful comparisons. Sorensen's similarity index is a binary method that compares presence-absense data and treats all species equally. It was necessary to use a binary method because the historical data for the most part were not quantitative."}, {"section_title": "12", "text": "Video images were frame grabbed using Ravenview TM software programmed to select a series of images with approximately 5 percent overlap, and saved as JPG files (N = 143 to 219 images per site). Each image was analyzed using point count (ten randomly distributed points per image) analysis to estimate the percent cover of the principal benthic groups: algae, sponges, octocorals, scleractinian corals, Millepora (fire corals), anemones, and substrate (rock and sediments). Point count for coral reefs is a public domain program that superimposes random points on each image. Point count data are saved as a spreadsheet for statistical analyses. Each ROV and fish video transect consists of a strip transect 2-m wide and the distance covered in length. Because of the narrow transect width, minimal viewer error occurred, allowing a total census of the area. All data in these analyses are expressed as number of individuals per 100 m. Each transect was assigned to one of eight habitat categories (Table 4), based on five pre-determined equally-spaced time interval observations of habitat type along the transect. At the end of each interval, the video was stopped to evaluate the benthic habitat type. Erratic logging by the ROV on Dive no. 12 resulted in not conducting transects. We summarized fish taxa by site and habitat and explored the relationship between habitat and site using cluster analysis. These data were subjected to agglomerative hierarchical clustering using the Sorenson similarity measure and flexible sorting linkage method to construct clusters (Dufrene and Legendre 1997). Rare tax that occurred at less than 10% of the site-habitat units were removed from the dataset to reduce potential bias from chance occurrences and poor sampling. Species indicator analysis determined the appropriate level and identity of taxa that characterized each cluster group (indicator species being the most characteristic taxa for a group) (McCune and Mefford 1999). Starting at the two-cluster level, each level was compared using the sum of the indicator values. The maximum sum of indicator values provided a measure of the appropriate clustering level for interpreting the data. Clusters below this level do not provide further substantive information on the relationship among groups. The taxon-specific indicator value was evaluated for statistical significance using the Monte Carlo test. Only those taxa with a probability level greater than 0.05 were considered significant indicators of a group. We used the PC-ORD program for these analyses (Krebs 1999). Among habitat differences were determined for four community parameters: \u2022 total number of taxa \u2022 abundance of the top five taxa. The Shannon-Weiner (H') provides an estimate of cumulative diversity, where H' = index of species diversity s = number of species p i = proportion of total sample belonging to the ith species. The larger the value of H', the greater the uncertainty. A community with only one species in it has no uncertainty and H' = 0. H' typically increases with the number of species in the community, but typically does not exceed 5.0 (Pielou 1977). Evenness estimates follow from this equation: where J' = the evenness of the community (Day and Quinn 1989). Abundance values were log transformed and habitat compared in a one-way ANOVA. Ryan's Q test was used as a posthoc test for differences among habitat when the overall ANOVA was significant (Peres-Neto 1999), where where p = the number of means in the group to be tested, b = adjusted significance level for a test of the equality of p means. ; because , so that the test using 1-(1-a) p/m is more powerful. The ANOVA p values were adjusted for multiple tests using the Bonferroni procedure (Krebs 1999), When heterogeneity of variance was high, a non-parametric equivalent, Kruskal-Wallis test, was used in conjunction with Dunn;s multiple comparison test. The Bray Curtis Measure evaluates the level of similarity among sites, where B = Bray-Curtis measure of dissimilarity X ij, X ik = Number of individuals in species I in each sample N = Number of species in samples The measure of similarity is the complement (1.0 -B). Understanding that the historical sampling was longer term and more intensive than that conducted in our study, and that the historical samples were primarily taken during the summer while ours were taken in late spring, we evaluated sample similarity using the Coefiicient of Sorensen. This is a binary coefficient that weights matches in species composition between two samples more heavily than mismatches (1981c). The coefficient is as follows: where S s = Sorensens's similarity coefficient, a = number of species present in sample A and B conjoined, b = number of species in sample B but not in sample A, and c = number of species in sample A but not in sample B."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "The data we collected in May 2003 represent a reasonable assessment of the FMG sites sampled in the mid-1970s (27-28 years ago). We benefited tremendously by having two of the original researchers onboard with us, including then Chief Scientist Thomas Hopkins (University of Alabama) and Michael Dardeu (Dauphin Island Research Laboratory). These two scientists provided visual confirmation of the bottom based on ROV video to help us select the dive sites. The sites did not appear to have original markers. Thus, although we were in the general area, we cannot verify we were sampling the same place that  sampled. Changes in navigation and positioning technologies of the last few decades made exact location of study sites difficult. The BLM (1981) sites studied in the 1970s were located using LORAN C, Decca Hi Fix technology, and a Raytheon DE 719B echosounder. Although it is possible to convert these coordinates to latitude -longitude coordinates, they are not georeferenced as are the satellite-based GPS coordinates. Sites visited in this study relied solely on Global Positioning System because the vessel chartered had a malfunctioning fathometer, making it difficult to locate ledges. Using the ROV in essence as a fathometer was problematic.

The intent of the larger study is to develop a method for using sediment constituents as indicators of reef condition. The Middle Grounds samples provide an outlier group in the analysis. Grain-size analysis followed standard procedures. Sediments from the 0.5 -< 1 mm and 1 -2 mm size classes were well mixed to create a subsample, which was sprinkled into a gridded tray and evaluated using a stereomicroscope. The first 300 calcareous grains encountered were identified into functional groups (Table 5) and counted. Proportions of skeletal fragments of zooxanthellate organisms (stony corals and larger foraminifers), autotrophic carbonate producers (coralline and calcareous algae), and heterotrophic carbonate producers (molluscs, echinoids, worm tubes, smaller forams, etc.), as well as unidentifiable carbonate grains, were weighted and summed to yield a single-metric value, called the SEDCON Index, for each sediment sample (Table 5). Foraminifers in the 0.5 to 2 mm size fractions were noted. Amphistegina gibbosa was prevalent at all six sites.

Champia salicornides and Dictota menstrualis were the most commonly collected species, occurring at four of the stations; 20 of the algae (genera/species) only occurred at one station ( Table 6). The majority of the species were rare, thus there is not a high degree of similarity among the sites (Table 14)."}, {"section_title": "Sponges", "text": "Many of the sponges occurring in the FMG are large, erect barrel and vase forms that add significantly to the biotic relief of the habitat. Forty-one species of sponges observed in this study (Table 7) include 34 positively identified species and 7 unidentified species collected for taxonomic evaluation. Quantitative assessment of sponges occurred at three sites (FMG247, FMG251, and FMG151) in which every individual colony was identified and counted. Hopkins et al. (2002) did not develop a complete species list of sponges because of the poorly developed state of sponge taxonomy at the time. The taxonomy still appears to be in some disarray. Our search on the web revealed at least two different systematic arrangements: The International Taxonomic Information System (ITIS: http://www.it is.usda.gov) and the classification of The Zoological Museum of Amsterdam at the University of Amsterdam (http://www.science.uva.nl/ZMA/Invertebrates.htm).

The most common species encountered were Pseudoceratina crassa, Niphates erecta, Amphimedon compressa, Cribrochalina vasculum, an unidentified hard orange sponge, Cinachyra alloclada, and Scopalina reutzleri. The abundance of these common sponge species ranged from 1.4 to 0.6 colonies/m 2 ."}, {"section_title": "Octocorals", "text": "We did not have an octocoral taxonomist available for this study so the identifications are not comparable in detail to those conducted by Grimm and Hopkins (1977). We identified ten octocoral species at the sampling sites (Table 8), compared to 13 species identified in the 1970s. Perhaps because of this, the similarity of the earlier studies with this one are not particularly high (Table 14). Muricea spp. (Sea fans) were the most abundant species found at five sampling sites, with 161 colonies at FMG 151 (N = 9 quadrats), 27 at FMG 247 (N = 10), and 88 colonies at FMG 251 (N = 5). This species was very abundant at all sites sampled in the 1970s. The octocorals in the Florida Middle Grounds, though relatively limited when compared to those of Caribbean reefs, are more diverse than other areas of the Gulf. Bright and Pequegnat (Jeffrey et al. 2001), for instance, found no octocorals in the West Flower Garden Banks."}, {"section_title": "Hydrocorals (Milliporina) and Stony Corals (Scleractinians)", "text": "We found 1 hydrocoral (Millepora alcicornis) and 16 species of stony corals at the Florida Middle Grounds (Table 9), compared to the single hydrocoral and 18 species of stony coral observed by . The two species present in historical samples that we did not observe were both cup corals, Phyllangia americana (The Hidden Cup Coral) and Astrangia poculata. Both these species were rare in historical studies so their absence in our quadrats is not surprising. Four species we observed but did not quanitify because they appeared outside of quadrats, including Agaricia fragilis (Fragile saucer coral), Siderastrea siderea (Massive starlet coral), Manicina areolata (Rose coral), and Cladocora arbuscula (Tube coral). We also observed one coral that did not appear in historical samples: Oculina robusta. Of greater interest is the absence of certain species at sites where they had been abundant in the 1970s. These include Madracis decactis (Ten-ray star coral) at FMG 247, and Porites porites divaricata (Thin finger coral) at FMG 147, 247, and 251. The latter species was generally in low abundance at all sites sampled in this study. Despite these differences, the species compositions were relatively similar (S = 0.690; Table 14). Fire coral formed massive colonies in the FMG during the 1970s, clearly contributing most to the frame building of the coral cover especially at 30-31 m."}, {"section_title": "Benthic cover", "text": "Biogenic cover was greatest at FMG 251 ( Figure 7), where it was nearly 60%. Octocorals dominated at this site, followed by sponges and algae. Sites with >30% cover included FMG 151 and FMG 47. Sites with cover around 20%, included GGR, FMG 491 and FMG 247. The least amount of cover occurred at FH. The functional groups that provided the most biotic cover were different at each of the sites. Sponges dominated Fisherman's Hole, and provided at least 20% of the cover at FMG 491, FMG 247, FMG 251, and Goliath Grouper Rock (Figure 8). Octocorals dominated most of the sites sampled (i.e., FMG 047, FMG151, FMG251, FMG 491, and Goliath Grouper Rock), whereas benthic algae dominated FMG 247. Fire coral (Millepora) was most abundant at FMG 491, where it provided nearly 32% of the benthic cover. It was least abundant (<10%) at FMG 247, FMG 251, and at the Fisherman's Hole. Stony corals (scleractinia) were most abundant at FMG 151, where they provided nearly 13 % of the cover. Given the benthic cover and classification, it appears that FMG 047 and FMG 151 are very similar, as are Fisherman's Hole and Goliath Grouper Rock (Figure 9). FMG 251 had little in common with the other sampling sites, which is likely do the preponderance of octocorals at this site."}, {"section_title": "Fishes", "text": "All fish species identified appear in Table 10. Seventy-four species were identified from the ROV video (Appendix C, species list by ROV sampling site), with an additional 16 species added from the ROV still images (Appendix D, species list by ROV sampling site), two species from the SCUBA fish transect videos, and three species from the SCUBA still images (Appendix E contains species by SCUBA sampling site). We ranked these species based on the method of data collection (appendices B-D, Table  10). The main difference in rank order of taxa determined from ROV video and from still images is the difficulty of identifying cryptic species with the lower resolution video camera. This is particularly evident in the Coryphopterus species of goby and seaweed blenny Parablennius marmoreus, common components of the ichthyofauna that only appeared in still images. The top five most abundant species include two planktivores (purple reeffish, Chromis scotti); yellowtail reeffish, Chromis enchrysura), one benthic carnivore (slippery dick, Halichoeres cf. bivittatus), and two herbivores (striped parrotfish Scarus cf iserti; cocoa damselfish Stegastes variabilis). The purple damselfish was overwhelmingly the most abundant species. This assemblage is similar to the reef fish assemblage in the Florida Keys, but differs in some important aspects. None of the top six species at the Dry Tortugas is common at the Florida Middle Grounds (Rocha 2003)."}, {"section_title": "Economically Important species", "text": "Three economically important species ranked among the top 20 species: grey snapper Lutjanus griseus, scamp Mycteroperca phenax, and red grouper Epinephelus morio. Grey snapper was represented by an adult population that occurred primarily along the shallow reef flat, especially abundant at FMG 147 and FMG 247. Only subadult scamp and red grouper were seen. Red snapper Lutjanus campechanus and gag Mycteroperca microlepis rarely appeared in our surveys, although they are among the most economically important species in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico."}, {"section_title": "New species and unusual fish", "text": "This study adds thirteen newly recorded species to the existing list for the FMG (Appendix F, marked with asterices). A summary of their position in the regional ichthyofauna along with the discussion of some additional records from museum collections and historical still images will be published in the future. Two species occur as unusual forms in the FMG. One of these is a new form of slippery dick Halichoeres cf. bivittatus, part of a subtropical group with individuals ranging from North Carolina through Florida and Bermuda (Humann and DeLoach 2002). The FMG form differs from the Caribbean form in its initial coloration phase by being more orange and more frequently having an enlarged mid-dorsal fin spot. The Caribbean form is typically tan or greenish and lacks the mid-dorsal fin spot (see pictorial glossary for fish). The FMG terminal phase has black and white bars on the caudal fin that are lacking in the Caribbean form The other species of interest is a form of striped parrotfish Scarus cf. iserti. The FMG Scarus form is most closely related to S. iserti, but differs in coloration from the Caribbean form. The FMG initial phase has dusky stripes with a yellowish caudal peduncle and caudal. The FMG terminal phase is smaller than the Caribbean form and has a more prominent yellow mid-body bar. This form awaits genetic analysis to determine if it is a separate species because the specimens we obtained were lost in a power failure during the hurricanes of 2004. This form is also found at the Dry Tortugas (Bohnsack et al. 1987). Fish by habitat type.--A comparison of fish abundance (number per 100 m 2 ) for the top five taxa and community parameters among habitat types using ANOVA indicated that the major differences occurred between sand and all other habitats (Table 11). The low relief sand habitat had few taxa, low abundance, and little reef fish diversity. The reef flat had surprisingly few taxa and low abundance, that may relate to its low rugosity and relief. Purple reef fish were most abundant on the reef crest and reef slope, and present in all other habitats with the exception of sand. Slippery dick abundance also differed among habitats, being most abundant over rubble and sand (Table 11), a habitat important to its congener in the keys (Austin 1971). Yellowtail reeffish was patchily distributed. Heterogeneity in variance was high, although a Kruskal-Wallis test still indicated differences among habitats. This species had substantially greater abundance on the reef base, particularly at the Sink Hole. The striped parrotfish and cocoa damselfish demonstrated no significant habitat-related differences in abundance (Table 11). Among-site comparisons were made using a habitat-by-site summary of reef fish abundance to account for variance in both factors. Cluster analysis applied to 34 widelydistributed taxa-those found in at least 10% of the habitat-site combinations-provided relevant information on relationships ( Figure 9). We compared cluster levels with the species indicator value (IV). The sum of IVs was greatest at the four-cluster level, indicating that this level had maximum information on differentiating groups. Based on the cluster analysis, Group 1 included habitats in deeper water at Deep South and Midway ( Figure 9). The gobiids, the yellowhead jawfish Opistognathus aurifrons, tattler Serranus phoebe, sand diver Synodus intermedius had significantly higher IVs for this group (Table 12). Group 2 included sand habitat and the reef base at FMG 251, where few fish occurred. Only one species had a significant IV in this group, the hovering burrow-dwelling blue dartfish Ptereleotris calliura, which occurs in sand patches among reefs and on sandy bottom. Group 3 included the main set of reef habitats that is unique to and characteristic of the FMG. Purple reeffish, scamp Mycteroperca phenax, and cocoa damselfish are indicators of this group (Table 12). Group 4 is a poorly resolved set of shallow reef flat and reef crest transects at sites FMG 147 and FMG 047. No taxa had significant IV in this group, although greenblotch parrotfish Sparisoma atomarium has a maximum IV here. This group indicates that there are differences in habitat among sites. These two sites are characterized by low abundance of common taxa, such as purple reeffish and cocoa damselfish. There is little difference in dominant species observed when compared to surveys by Clarke (1986), though rank order did differ (Table 13). It appears that yellowtail reeffish, grey snapper, and barred hamlet were more abundant in the recent survey, while neon gobies, greater amberjack, and red porgy were more common in the historical surveys. Based on the Sorensen coefficient of similarity, the fish fauna from historical studies were remarkably similar for the top twenty species evaluated (S = 0.941). The similarity was considerably lower when comparing our study to all historical studies (S = 0.550). Ours were most similar to Smith et al (1975) (S = 0.567) and least similar to Hopkins (1981) (S = 0.517) ( Table 14). The differences over all occur when the rarer species are included. Thus, these differences may be more a function of sampling intensity than any real differences in faunal composition."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "It has been nearly 25 years since last survey of The Florida Middle Grounds. Previous studies were conducted in the 1970s by Austin (1974), Smith and Ogren (1979), Livingston (Grimm andHopkins 1977, Grimm 1978), Grimm (Hopkins 1974, Hopkins 1981a, Hopkins 1981c, and , among others. The historical algal diversity was far greater (N = 74-79 species) than the diversity we encountered (N = 28). This likely results from the seasonality of algal species. Diversity is far greater in the summer and early fall than at other times of year. Indeed,  found winter diversity to be about a third of that occurring in the warm season, which is consistent with our mid-spring finding. In addition, the algae cover percentages we describe are remarkably similar to those reported in Hopkins et al. (Grimm and Hopkins 1977). Hopkins reported 61% of the species present were Rhodophyta, 28 % Chlorophyta, and 11% Phaeophyta. He also reported that Chlorophyta often dominated in terms of biomass. Gelatinous red algae seemed to be the most conspicuous and abundant in late May. The sponges formed a conspicuous and important component of the benthic community in the Florida Middle Grounds, making a major contribution to the total percentage of living cover of the reef at all sites sampled. The Florida Middle Ground stony corals are considered impoverished compared to the corals of Caribbean reefs (1981c). Nonetheless, the FMG is unique for the northeastern Gulf of Mexico by having any corals at all. . Hopkins (Bullock and Smith 1979) suggests that the hard and soft corals of the Florida Middle Grounds experienced a major environmentally-induced trauma between the summers of 1976 and 1978, a period between two of his intensive sampling operations. Soft corals declined in number and many appeared emaciated when present. Millepora alcicornis, formerly abundant on the reef, declined dramatically, and, along with Dichocoenia, Oculina, and Porites colonies, were dead. The suspected culprits include exceptionally cold winters bringing 12-13\u00b0C water in shallow waters of that section of the Gulf of Mexico, and extreme storm surge (Doyle and Sparks 1980). Hopkins suggests that this combination of events could result in the following impacts on coral: o Partial burial of low-aspect species (e.g., Scolymia, Manicina, Meandrina) o Uprooting and breakage of delicate corals (e.g., Agaricia, Millepora) and many gorgonians o Zooxanthellae expulsion and tissue necrosis in all soft and stony coral species. Using the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's World Ocean Database (http://www.nodc.noaa.gov/OC5/SELECT/dbsearch/dbsearch.html), we found that from 1975 through 2001, the fall bottom temperatures (October -December) reported from scientifici cruises in or near the FMG ranged from 19.3\u00b0 to 29.6\u00b0 C, while winter temperatures (January -March) ranged from 14.1\u00b0 to 23.4\u00b0C. The only reference to temperatures at the FMG dropping to 11\u00b0C occurred on 2 September 1990, so we suspect this may actually represent a thermometer malfunction. It is not clear in the Bullock and Smith paper whether the cold temperatures experienced inshore in the 1970s extended as far offshore as the FMG. However, correlative evidence of cold stress is found in their report of die-offs of tropical reef fishes (e.g., butterfly fishes, angelfishes), and poor body condition of temperate reef species (e.g., gray snapper and hogfish). They did not report on the condition of the corals, except inshore as it related to localized storm surge. Sediment movement during the severe weather conditions of hurricanes and tropical storms certainly occurs, as evidenced by the large fields of both small and large sand waves apparent along this part of the shelf (1966). We observed small sand waves throughout the low relief sandy areas of the Florida Middle Grounds at about 37 meters depth ( Figure 12). We evaluated the major storms (tropical storms, no-name storms, and hurricanes) ( Figure 13) occurring over or near the Florida Middle Grounds for wind speed and wave height, based on information from the following sources: (1) in situ NOAA data buoys o 42003 (located at 26.01 N 85.91 W) \u2022 42036 (located at 28.51 N 84.51 W) (2) Unisys Hurricane database (http://weather.unisys.com/hurricane/atlantic/) (3) NOAA hurricane archives (http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pastall.shtml). We included only those storms that created waves at least 4 m high near the FMG. These waves (which fall somewhere in between deep water gravity waves and shallow water gravity waves) can cause significant horizontal velocities near the bottom at 20 to 40 m depths. Plots of these relationships (Figures 14 and 15), following Phillips (Moe 1963, Smith 1976 show maximum horizontal velocities during the overhead passage of a surface gravity wave. The speeds are those that would occur 2 m above the bottom. Keep in mind that a particle traces the path of an ellipse in the vertical each time a wave passes overhead. These ellipses flatten out toward the bottom so that motion is nearly back and forth. The plots here give only the maximum speeds during one of these cycles. The first plot shows maximum particle speeds for different wavelengths (from 10 to 100 m) for 20 m, 30 m, and 40 m total water depth. The second plot is for 30 m water depth (about that found in much of the coral-covered area of the FMG) and shows how the maximum velocity near the bottom varies with wavelength. For reasonable values, these fall between about 0.5 to 2.0 m/s, which is sufficient to stir up the sediment and perhaps break delicate corals. The speed is a function of wave period, wave height, wavelength, ocean depth, and height above the bottom. For either very shallow water or very deep water, we can simplify this further, but for this region, it's difficult to say whether the deep or shallow water limit applies so it remains a bit complicated. Fish populations in the Florida Middle Grounds have long experienced intensive fishing effort from both commercial and recreational fishers (1977). Indeed, populations experience intense, but largely unquantified fishing pressure. The most sought after species historically were red grouper, black grouper, red snapper, and scamp, with most of the activity occurring in the summer (Moe 1963). While the area is protected from coral harvest and certain types of bottom gear (i.e., traps, trawls, and longlines), no other fishing restrictions occur. Yet no studies have evaluated the impact of this intensive activity on reef fish populations and only one study (Mallinson 2000) has evaluated the effect on habitat. Most of these were largely descriptive in nature. Clarke's (1986) study, however, provided the first real census of fish populations and demonstration of species habitat relationships."}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "text": "The Florida Middle Ground is clearly a unique area. The only other coral habitat in the northern Gulf of Mexico occurs in the western Gulf, particularly in the Flower Gardens National Marine Sanctuary. The faunal make-up of these two areas are distinct, however, and should be treated as such. The Flower Gardens received significantly more attention following its designation as a National Marine Sanctuary. While we are not necessarily recommending the same treatment for the Florida Middle Grounds, we do think that more study in the Florida Middle Grounds is warranted. Both areas are protected from coral harvest and the use of bottom-associated fishing gear. However, fishing activity by hook and line remains intense and largely unquantified, both by commercial and recreational fishers. There is some concern that anchor use in the FMG could prove detrimental to the unique and delicate coral and sponge communities of the region. We make the following simple recommendations for the Florida Middle Grounds: \u2022 Establishment of permanent station markers at the sites evaluated in this study; \u2022 Periodic (ten-year) monitoring of the health of benthic communities \u2022 In-depth assessment of commercial and recreational fishing activity \u2022 In-depth assessment of the importance of the FMG as source habitat for ecologically and economically important species \u2022 Permanent closure to all extractive and destructive uses of the high-relief reef habitat (northern half of the FMG; Figure 3) because of its unique habitat and diverse species composition.
