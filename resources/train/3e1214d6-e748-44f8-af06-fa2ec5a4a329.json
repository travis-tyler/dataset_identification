[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "As the number of children living in poverty and in non-traditional families grows, so too does concern over whether living in such situations has effects on child development (Bumpass and Lu 2000;Fields and Casper 2001). Much evidence suggests that growing up in poverty has adverse consequences for a variety of child outcomes, including health, academic and occupational achievement, and socialization (Duncan et al. 1998;Pagani et al. 1997;Smith et al. 1997), as does growing up with high levels of family stress (Menaghan et al. 1997;Yamoor and Mortimer 1990) or in nontraditional-or fragilefamilies (McLanahan and Burnpass 1 988;McLanahan and Sandefur 1994). Even as scholars lavish attention on these issues, relatively few delve into the specifics of how different types of fragile families may function and how social dynamics may affect the children who grow up in such families. Although focusing on the differences between, for example, single-parent families and two-parent families, as is commonly done, has uncovered important information about fragile families, focusing only on such analyses obscures potentially important differences between several different types of fragile families (never-married, divorced, stepparenting, widowed, and cohabiting families). There are solid theoretical reasons to believe that the processes and mechanisms causing these families to be fragile might differ; for example, we might expect some types of singleparent families, such as never-married and divorced families, to be at greater risk for poverty because of the presence of only one potential breadwinner, while other types of single-parent families, such as widowed families, might have financial safety nets in place that protect children from experiencing severe and extended poverty. Similarly, although stepparent and cohabiting families may be less prone to poverty because of the presence of two potential breadwinners, they may have a tendency toward higher rates of conflict than families where children's biological parents are married to each other. When discussing fragile families, focusing only on single parents prevents us fiom fully understanding the challenges facing different types of singleparent families and ignores entirely the problems certain kinds of two-parent families face. In this paper, we focus on a particular risk factor for adolescents-high-intensity work-as an example of how investigating the structures and processes in multiple types of fragile families may give scholars and policy-makers a better understanding of the challenges these families face."}, {"section_title": "1.", "text": "ADOLESCENT EMPLOYMENT"}, {"section_title": "Academic achievement", "text": "Most studies on the effects of adolescent employment have utilized a \"zero-sum\" perspective (D'Amico 1984;Warren 2002). This perspective defines time as a finite resource and assumes that time spent in paid work is time that cannot be used in educational, social, or family activities. A natural outgrowth of the zero-sum perspective is a focus on educational outcomes; as students spend time working outside the home for pay, they may have less time to devote to homework or studying. As a result, adolescent labor force participation may be associated with lower academic achievement. Early studies of adolescent employment supported the zero-sum argument: students who worked for pay during the school year reported lower grades (Greenberger et al. 1980;Steinberg et al. 1981); D'Amico (1984) and Lewin-Epstein (1981) found that early employment reduced time spent on homework. Further, adolescents who work spent less time reading books not assigned for school (Greenberger and Steinberg 1986). Subsequent research demonstrated that the effects of student employment could be better understood by studying work intensity, or the number of hours students worked, rather than merely whether they worked. Students who work in low-intensity, part-time jobs tend to have better academic outcomes than those who do not work at all, possibly because they learn how to better manage their time in order to accomplish all of their goals (D' Amico 1984). Challenging the zero-sum perspective, Schoenhals, Tienda, and Schneider (1998) found that students who worked watched less television than those who did not. In addition, a study of 251 low-income, at-risk African American youth found that stable, low-intensity work may be linked to high school completion and, for boys, college attendance, suggesting the possibility that positive work environments could be particularly helpful for at-risk students (Leventhal et al. 2001). However, students who participate in more intense work situations (generally described as working 20 or more hours per week during the school year) have lower grades and lower educational aspirations (Barton 1989;Finch et al. 1991;Finch and Mortimer 1985;Jakob-Chien and Dukes 1998;Lillydahl 1990;Markel and Frone 1997;Marsh 1991;Mihalic and Elliottt 1997;Mortimer et al. 1996;Steinberg and Dombusch 1991), are more often absent from school (Marsh 1991;Steinberg et al. 1993), and more often seem fatigued in class than do their peers who do not work or who work in lower intensity situations (Bills et al. 1995). High-intensity work is also associated with lower enrollment in post-secondary schooling for boys (Mortimer and Johnson 1997). Although findings regarding the effects of adolescent employment on academic outcomes while in high school are somewhat mixed, most scholars now contend that high-intensity work poses the most danger, while low-intensity work may actually be beneficial for schooling."}, {"section_title": "Non-academic outcomes", "text": "The effects of adolescent employment are not limited to academic outcomes. Many parents believe that adolescent participation in the workforce imbues positive socialization that will encourage teenagers to embrace a work ethic, to appreciate the value of punctuality, and to seek paid employment more readily after high school. Research has generally borne out these parental assumptions: teenagers who work during high school are less likely to be unemployed in the first four years after high school (Marsh 1991;Mortimer and Finch 1996;Steel 1991) and further into adulthood (Mihalic and Elliott 1997), and they enjoy higher wages (Marsh 1991;Stone and Mortimer 1998). Adolescent workers also have greater workplace skills (Greenberger et al. 1980) and stronger work orientation (Steinberg et al. 1981) than those who have not worked. Adolescents who work in family-owned businesses, where their parents can presumably take an active role in workplace socialization, perceived greater parental support for their labor force and academic goals and reported less drug and alcohol use than teens working in the private sector (Hansen and Jarvis 2000). Adolescent work experience may influence psychological outcomes as well. Working outside the home for pay adds additional sources of stress to adolescents' lives that may have deleterious effects on their overall wellbeing. Markel and Frone (1997) found that students engaged in highintensity work experienced more work-school conflict, which was related to a lack of school readiness and greater stress. Poor work-school connections are associated with depression for girls; female respondents also reported more stress linked with feelings of responsibility for things outside of their control, including work issues. Similarly, boys report that work stress influences their depression (Shanahan et al. 1991). Adolescents who report problems at work were more likely to be depressed and to have negative views of themselves than were those who did not work or who did not report work problems (Simons and Miller 1987). Students who work also report more cynicism about the workplace and more acceptance of unethical business practices (Steinberg et al. 198 1). Participation in the paid labor market may also influence adolescents' relationships. Teenagers who work spend less time with their families and report less closeness with their families than do non-workers (Oreenberger et al. 1980;Mihalic and Elliott 1997;Pickering and Vazsonyi 2002;Roisman 2002;Shanahan et al. 1996). Again, work intensity was an important factor in these relationships; the effects of working on family relationships are stronger for teens working more than 20 hours per week than for those in low-intensity work (Pickering and Vazsonyi 2002;Roisman 2002). Adolescents working in high-intensity situations may also have strained relationships at school, where they are less integrated into school activities (McNeal 1995) and may be assessed less positively by their teachers (Yamoor and Mortimer 1990). Finally, working more than 20 hours per week may encourage adolescents to engage in delinquent or inappropriate behavior. Some scholars have argued that adolescents are exposed to non-familial adults in the workplace, some of whom may model delinquent or illegal behavior (such as drug use), while others may merely model behavior that is deemed appropriate for adults but inappropriate for minors (such as alcohol use or sexual activity). Other researchers maintain that teens who work more are able to engage in delinquent behaviors because they are not subject to the same level of parental monitoring as are adolescents who, because they work less, are around their parents more. Proponents of both perspectives, however, agree that high-intensity work is related to negative risk behaviors. Adolescents who work more than 20 hours per week engage in more sexual risk-taking behavior (Ku et al. 1993;Valois and Dunham 1998) and delinquent behavior such as smoking and petty crime (Jakob-Chien and Dukes 1998; Miller and Matthews 2001). High-intensity workers are also more likely to use alcohol and drugs when still in school (Hansen and Jarvis 2000;Jakib-Chien and Dukes 1998;Jenkins 1996;Kouvonen and Lintonen 2002;McMorris and Uggen 2000;Mihalic and Elliott 1997) and to report higher rates of marijuana and alcohol use in their late 20s (Mihalic and Elliottt 1997). Adolescent participation in the paid labor force, then, is something of a mixed bag. Low-intensity work may help youth learn positive work ethic and time-management skills, leading to improved academic outcomes and increased attachment to the labor force. High-intensity work may leave teens at risk for work-school conflict, strained family relationships, and increased participation in delinquent and inappropriate behavior."}, {"section_title": "FRAGILE FAMILIES", "text": "Given what we know about teenage employment, it seems reasonable to ask what effect growing up in a fragile family might have on adolescent work force participation. First, children who grow up in various fkagile family structures and children engaged in high-intensity work both fare poorly with respect to education, delinquency, and family relationships. Yet few researchers have investigated whether differences in working environments and motives could explain why these families struggle. For example, living in a mother-headed household has been linked to lower academic achievement (Duncan et al. 1998;Pagani et al. 1997;McLanahan and Sandefur 1994;Smith et al. 1997). Although teens who work many hours per week also have lower academic outcomes, little research has examined whether a corresponding link exists. Similarly, although poverty is a major correlate of living in a fragile family, children who grow up in single-parent families are less likely to graduate from high school and more likely to engage in delinquent behaviors than their counterparts in two-biological-parent families, even when they are not poor (McLanahan and Sandefur 1994). Adolescents in stepparent families, with two potential adult earners in the family, are less likely to be in severe financial distress than are those in single-parent families (excluding widowed families). Yet adolescents in both single-and stepfamilies exhibit more problematic behaviors and outcomes than their counterparts in twobiological-parent families (with children in stepparent families similar to those in single-parent families, and those in widowed families occupying a position between the other two). For example, teens in stepparent families are less likely to graduate from high school than teens who live with their biological parents, but are more likely to engage in risky sexual or substance abuse behaviors (Aquilino 1991 ;Downey 1995;Flewelling and Baurnan 1990;Hoffmann 1994;Jenkins and Zunguze 1998;Sandefur et al. 1992;Tygart 1990); teens in widowed families, while somewhat more successful than those in stepparent families, are also less likely to graduate from high school than teens who live with their biological parents (Ambert and Saucier 1984;Saucier and Ambert 1983). Again, these outcomes are similar to those found for adolescents who are in high-intensity work situations, but little effort has been made to examine any possible links between living in a fragile family and working long hours. Perhaps most important, the differences in adolescents' lives that make some of their families ffagile may be similar to the factors that help determine how much they work. For example, teens in poor, mother-headed families might work more hours in order to help their families make ends meet or to be able to afford status-producing consumer goods that parents in wealthier families could purchase for their children; they therefore may incur some of the academic penalties associated with high-intensity work as a result. However, few studies examining academic outcomes have investigated the extent to which work and family demands may be helping to drive the negative effects of living in fragile families. Similarly, if family conflict or stressors encourage youth to spend less time at home and more time at work, the time and social pressures associated with high-intensity work may contribute to academic trouble or delinquent behavior. In other words, although we know that teens from fragile families struggle because of poverty and family stressors, we have yet to thoroughly investigate how these factors play out in different kinds of fragile families and how their effects may be mediated by other influences in children's lives, such as labor market participation. Most of the work that looks at whether family structure affects adolescent work habits examines European countries where secondary schooling ends earlier than it does in the United States and full-time work is the most common experience for those in late adolescence (de Goede et al. 2000;Patten and Noller 1991). The few that do examine the effect of family structure on adolescent work in the U.S., such as Schoenhals et al.'s (1998) careful study, tend to focus on comparisons between single-parent and twoparent families, with no distinction made as to how the single-parent families were formed. This inattention to family structure likely has several causes. First, early studies predicting whether teens worked for pay found few notable differences between family structures. Even Schoenhals et al. (1998) finds the most interesting outcomes are related to family structure for single mothers who do non-traditional work; single-mother parenting in and of itself does not affect teen employment. These (non-)findings may have led researchers to believe that they would find no differences in the hours worked among teens from different family structures. In addition, much of the work in this field has relied on relatively small samples. Small samples provide insufficient cases to distinguish between family types; in fact, the few studies that do analyze family structure focus only on single-parent versus two-parent families, without distinguishing between divorced and never-married parents or among step, cohabiting, or married biological parents. Unfortunately, these data problems have led scholars to ignore theoretical explanations for why adolescents in fragile families might engage in a risky behavior: high-intensity work. Researchers also have been unable to investigate whether different mechanisms and processes within different kinds of fragile families drive potential differences in working patterns (i.e., if financial issues encourage children in divorced families to work more hours, or whether family conflict drives children in stepfamilies to work more). In this study, we use a large, nationally representative data set to test hypotheses regarding the relationship between living in a fragile family structure and engaging in high-intensity work. We also examine whether these factors are related to the ways teachers, who control many educational experiences and outcomes for adolescents, assess youth from fragile families."}, {"section_title": "HYPOTHESES", "text": "Hypothesis 1 : Adolescents in fragile family structures will work more hours than those in biological two-parent families. Hypothesis 2: Socioeconomic factors, including spending patterns, will explain why teens from divorced and never-married families work more hours than those in biological two-parent families. Hypothesis 3: Family interaction and atmosphere will explain why teens from stepparent, widowed, and cohabiting families work more hours than those in biological two-parent families. Hypotheses 4a and 4b: High-intensity work, linked to SES and family interaction and atmosphere variables, will explain the more negative assessments teachers give to adolescents in fragile families, including appraisals of a) homework completion and b) alertness."}, {"section_title": "DATA AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "We use data from the first and second follow-up waves of the National Education Longitudinal Study (NELS), conducted by the National Center for Educational Statistics (NCES). The NELS is a nationally representative study that gathered data from students, parents, teachers, and school administrators. The first wave of the study was conducted in 1988, drawing random samples of approximately 25 eighth-grade students from each of 1000 randomly selected schools. Students were surveyed again in loth grade (1990), 1 2 '~ grade (1992), two years after their class would have graduated from high school (1994), and six years after their class would have graduated from high school (2000). We employ data from the loth and 12'~ grade surveys. Since the focus of this study was whether living in fragile families influences work participation, we excluded respondents who had missing data for family structure and work participation variables. This yielded a sample of 10,585, of whom 64 percent lived in two-parent biological families, 14 percent lived in stepparent families, 15 percent lived in divorced families, four percent lived in widowed families, three percent lived in never-married families, and one percent lived in cohabiting families. Table 7-1 describes the variables used in our analyses. Currently employed is a dummy variable that captures whether the respondent was working outside the home for pay in 1992 ( 1 2~ grade). Number of hours worked is a continuous variable that measured how many hours per week the respondent worked in her primary job during the 1991-1992 school year; higher scores indicate greater work intensity. Teacher assessments of how often respondents handed in their homework on schedule or were alert in class are measured by two dummy variables: always turns in homework and always alert in class. Family structure is measured by a set of dummy variables that tapped the respondents' parents' marital status: married, never married, divorced, widowed, remarried (which we refer to throughout the paper as stepparent), and living in a marriage-like relationship (which we refer to throughout the paper as cohabiting); married is the reference category. Although many studies, including this one, often refer to families where the biological parents of the respondents are married to each other as two-biological parent families, we should note that we have no way of determining whether the small uust over 100) number of youth living in cohabiting families are living with one or both biological parents."}, {"section_title": "Measures", "text": "The NELS does not contain a perfect measure of whether respondents spend their money on necessities to help their families make ends meet. The most similar variable is likely one that asks whether the respondent spends most of his or her money on rent. As might be expected, less than one percent of respondents chose this response. To tap money spent on necessities, we use a variable that asks whether respondents spend most of their money on rent or education. Although this variable may not perfectly capture whether the respondent is working in order to help support the family of origin or pay for education (educational fees could be for activities rather than tuition, for example), this variable does distinguish money spent on rent and education from money spent on cars or \"going out\". Family interaction is a scale tapping how often the respondent talks to his or her parents about various subjects. In order to address issues of causality, we include measures of family interaction in both 10\" grade and grade; if the change in family interaction over time is associated with work intensity, it provides additional evidence that adolescents choose to work more intense hours in order to avoid their homes and families. The loth grade family interaction variable includes five items concerning discussion about matters such as class schedules and educational aspirations and has an alpha of .79; the 12'~ grade family interaction variable consists of nine items similar to those used in the 1 0~ grade measure and has an alpha of .86. For both variables, higher scores indicate more interaction. Negative family atmosphere is a single item that asks how important it is to the respondent to get away from his or her parents. Again, family atmosphere is measured in both 10\" and 12'~ grades. Higher scores indicate more desire to get away from parents and a less desirable family atmosphere. Socioeconomic status is a composite measure created by the NCES that reflects parents' income, education, and occupational status. Sex is a dummy variable; race is tapped by a set of dummy variables: white, Black, Asian/PaciJic Islander, Hispanic, and American Indian; white is the reference category. We also control for region (Northeast, Midwest, South, and West; Northeast is the reference category) and urbanicity (urban, suburban, and rural; suburban is the reference category). Finally, because we include measures of family interaction, we also control for sibship size to ascertain whether adolescents in larger families interact less with parents because parental time is diluted across multiple children (Downey 1995)."}, {"section_title": "4.3", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "We employ binary logistic regression to examine whether living in a fragile family influences whether an adolescent worked in 1 2~~ grade, whether teachers believed the adolescent always turned in homework, and whether teachers felt the adolescent was always alert in class. Because only half of the respondents were linked to data for these teacher assessment variables, the Ns for those two models are 5,035. Because of the criteria used for inclusion in the sample, the only other missing data were found on continuous variables; we used mean substitution to address the missing data for these variables and included dummy variables indicating that substitution to account for potential bias (Cohen and Cohen 1975).' We entered the key variables in steps to examine their distinct effects. Model 1 examines the effects of living in different types of fragile families. For the models predicting work intensity, Model 2 adds spending habits; Model 3 includes family interaction and atmosphere variables; Model 4 controls for demographic background variables, including SES, and Model 5 includes important interaction effects. For the models predicting teacher assessments of their students, Model 2 adds work intensity; Model 3 includes spending habits; Model 4 adds family interaction and atmosphere variables; Model 5 controls for demographic background variables, and Model 6 includes significant interaction effects between fragile family structures and other independent variables. Table 7-2 displays the mean levels of the variables included in the model by family structure. Adolescents in married and stepparent families are more likely to work than those in never-married, divorced, widowed, and cohabiting families.* There are significant differences among family structures in work intensity: teens in fragile family structures work more hours than do teens in married families (although, at the mean level, no group on average meets the 20+ hours per week generally described as highintensity). Adolescents in never married and stepparent families work on average about two and one-half hours more per week than do those in married families. The small number of youth in cohabiting families (just over 100) work on average nearly five and one-half more hours per week than their peers in married families. Students in fragile family structures are also assessed more negatively by their teachers. Adolescents in married families are slightly more likely to interact with their parents in both loth and 12'~ grade than are adolescents in fragile families; these respondents also are slightly less likely to want to get away from their parents. Married families report significantly higher SES than do fragile families. Teens in never-married families are much more likely to be Black, while most teens in married, divorced, or stepfamilies are white. Interestingly, adolescents in married families have the fewest siblings, while those in reconstituted families report the most. Those in married and stepfamilies are more likely to live in suburbs than adolescents in other family types. More teens in never-married families live in the South, perhaps reflecting the racial distribution of these families.   Table 7-3 shows the results of the logistic regression analysis predicting whether the adolescent worked for pay outside the home in 12'~ grade. As expected, none of the fragile family structures produces adolescents significantly more likely to work, a finding similar to those that may have discouraged previous researchers from further investigating work patterns."}, {"section_title": "5.", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "FINDINGS", "text": "The results in Table 7-4, however, suggest that ignoring more detailed work patterns may be a mistake. Model 1 in Table 7 4 shows that adolescents who live in stepparent, never-married, divorced, and cohabiting families all work significantly more hours than do adolescents in married families. Although it is difficult to tell if working 1-1.5 hours more per week will have a detrimental effect in and of itself, this finding suggests that analyses testing only whether youth work outside the home are not sufficient. Living in a fragile family structure is in fact associated with working more hours while still in high school. Model 2 demonstrates that spending most of one's money on rent or education is also associated with increased work intensity, although this variable does not alone explain away the effects of living in certain types of fragile families (notably divorced and never married families, as predicted in Hypothesis 2). Model 3 includes measures of family interaction in the loth and grades, as well as family atmosphere variables. Improved family interaction is associated with lower work intensity, while worsening family atmosphere is associated with slightly higher work intensity. In this model, the effect of living in a never married family is no longer significant, suggesting that changes in family interaction and atmosphere have a greater effect on whether adolescents in that fragile family type work long hours than do financial aspects (contrary to the hypothesis regarding that family structure). Model 4 introduces background characteristics, including SES. Adolescents from families with greater SES work significantly fewer hours; although other demographic characteristics are significant in this model, it is the effect of SES that explains away the effects of living in a divorced or cohabiting family structure (separate analyses not shown). The effects of other demographic variables (boys work more than girls; urban and rural teens work less than suburban teens, etc.) are consistent with previous research on adolescent work. In Model 4, only the effect of growing up in a stepparent family persists. Model 5 introduces interactions between fragile family types and other explanatory variables. Youth who live in stepparent families and who feel more strongly about getting away from their parents work more hours than do those in stepparent families with positive atmospheres (Figure la). It is this interaction effect that finally explains away the effect of stepparent family structure. The effect of increased SES lowers work hours more for adolescents in married families than in divorced families (Figure lb), with a similar pattern occurring when comparing widowed families to married families (Figure lc). Finally, Hispanic teens in stepparent families work fewer hours than do white teens in stepparent families ( Figure Id). Negative family atmosphere This model provides support for Hypothesis 1 (teens in fragile family structures will work more hours than those in married families), some evidence for Hypothesis 2 (the effects of living in a divorced family disappear with SES and spending habits), and some support for Hypothesis 3 (teens in stepfamilies with deteriorating family atmospheres work more hours than teens in stepfamilies with improving family atmospheres). Turning to academic issues, Table 7-5 presents the analyses predicting whether teachers believe the respondent turns in homework on time. Teachers have significantly more negative opinions of students' task completion for adolescents from all but cohabiting fragile families than they do for students from married families. When work intensity is controlled, the effects of living in a never married or divorced family become somewhat less significant but do not go away entirely. Students who spend most of their money on necessities actually have more positive assessments from teachers (Model 3), as do those in families with more interaction, while students in families with deteriorating atmospheres are less likely to turn in their homework (Model 4). Still, none of these factors fully explain the effects of living in fragile family structures. The inclusion of background characteristics (Model 5) explains the negative effect of living in a never married family, with being Black the key variable (separate analyses not shown). The interaction effect in Model 6 seems to bear this out, with Black students in never married families more likely to turn in homework than white students in the same family structure (Figure 2).  Table 7-6 reports similar findings for teachers' assessment of students' alertness in class. Again, teachers have significantly more negative opinions of students from all but cohabiting fragile families than they do of students from married families. Controlling for work intensity explains the negative effect of students from widowed families. Students who spend most of their money on necessities are actually reported as being more alert (Model 3). Model 4 shows that students who interact more with their parents are more alert in class, while those who have a more negative family atmosphere are reported to be less alert (note that these models do not reflect change in family interaction or atmosphere; the change models were not significant in predicting alertness in class). These family interaction and atmosphere variables explain away the effect of living in a never-married family. Model 5 includes background characteristics, which decrease the effects of living in a stepparent or divorced family. However, the effects of living in these types of fragile families persist even after controlling for SES and race. Model 6 introduces an interaction term between living in a never married family and being Black (see Figure 7-3); as was the case for the models predicting teacher assessment of timely homework completion, this interaction indicates that teachers rate Black students from never-married families as more alert than white students in the same kind of family. "}, {"section_title": "ALTERNATIVE EXPLANATIONS", "text": "Factors that affect academic participation and achievement among youth who grow up in fragile families may not be limited to paid employment. For example, receipt of government aid in the form of food stamps, housing vouchers, Social Security benefits, or AFDC monies may lessen the pressure for adolescents to provide financial support for the family. In these cases, the absence of a parent may be mitigated by social safety nets, and it is possible that students whose families receive such aid might work less and therefore be able to devote more attention to school. On the other hand, youth in single-parent families may be required to provide more unpaid child care for their own siblings, both to cover for parents who are working long hours or multiple jobs in response to financial pressures and because of the lack of a second adult in the home who could provide supervision for younger children. Although unpaid child care may not be reported as paid employment, the time spent in such tasks may have similar effects in distracting students from school activities as working a paid job would. To test these ideas, we included variables tapping the student's report of receipt of government aid and student's report of hours spent babysitting his or her own siblings. In none of the models did these two variables have any effect. In addition, we tested our models on subsamples of youth who reported substantial familial receipt of government aid and youth who reported spending long hours babysitting their siblings. Our models behaved in very similar manners for these subsamples and for the general sample, suggesting that welfare receipt and time spent providing child care had little effect on school outcomes. We speculate that this finding reflects data that are unable to fully capture the concepts in question: although a variable is available asking respondents about time spent babysitting siblings, it is not possible to distinguish whether respondents receive pay for this activity, nor can we be sure that respondents who do receive pay do not report this activity as paid employment. Similarly, the only data available on family welfare receipt come from the adolescents, who may or may not be aware of the extent of family dependence on these safety nets. Future research using data more conducive to testing the effects of welfare receipt and family caretaking may provide more information."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "Although many of the factors that make non-traditional families fragile are similar to those that encourage adolescents to engage in the high-risk activity of high-intensity work, little research has examined possible relationships between work behaviors and growing up in a fragile family. In this study, we use a nationally representative data set to examine whether youth in fragile families are at risk for working high-intensity hours and whether the mechanisms operating in the different kinds of fragile families to encourage high-intensity work vary by family type. Results provide mixed support for the specific hypotheses: Teens in fragile family structures work more hours than their peers in married families, and socioeconomic status was influential in explaining the effect of living in a divorced family on work hours. Similarly, youth who had lost a parent through death were less susceptible to the effects of SES on high-intensity work than were teens in married families, perhaps reflecting the financial safety nets many widowed families are able to call upon. However, it was the effect of family interaction and atmosphere variables, rather than SES, that explained the effects of living in a never-married family. Although we might assume that youth in cohabiting families might have access to more financial resources than youth in single-parent families, it was the effect of socioeconomic status that explains why these youth work more hours. However, family atmosphere did help to explain why adolescents from stepparent families work more intense hours, as those who express more desire to get away from their parents work more than do otherwise similar teens who are less worried about getting away. Similarly, students who engaged in high-intensity work received lower assessments from their teachers, but this effect did not entirely explain away the negative assessments teachers give students from fragile families. Even after controlling for work hours, spending habits, and family interaction and atmosphere, as well as demographic characteristics, youth in stepparent, divorced, and widowed families more often fail to turn in homework on time and are less alert in class than youth in married families. This may be due to additional important factors not in the models; while focusing on issues of work intensity and family structure, we have not yet examined the role of other possible influences, such as other extracurricular activities, academic aspirations and orientations, and self-concept, that may affect how teachers view students. Future work should examine how fragile family structures and work intensity may act in conjunction with these variables to explain how teachers assess students from fragile families. These models also point out the importance of considering other demographic variables, such as race, in conjunction with fragile family status. Interaction effects between nevermarried family status and being Black showed that white teens in nevermarried families were assessed more negatively by teachers than were Black teens in the same family structure, perhaps indicating more normative acceptance for Black families of this structure. Given that 52 percent of never-married families in this sample are Black, it is possible that these families are more accepted in communities as a normative family type, or that more families of this type live in the same area and can provide social support for each other (never-married families are concentrated in the South). Never-married white families, however, may have fewer social resources or may be considered less normative and may draw more attention and disapproval from people outside the family, such as teachers. Unless we consider each type of fragile family separately, we risk missing out on these processes. In addition, adolescents' spending habits provided mixed evidence for the influence of work on youth from fragile families. We hypothesized that youth in fragile families, particularly those in families at greater risk for poverty (most of the single-parent family types), would work more hours if they needed money to spend on necessities, possibly leading to lower academic outcomes and greater exposure to risky behavior. In fact, spending most of their money on rent and education was associated with teens' working more hours, but youth who spent their money in this fashion also received more favorable assessments from teachers, a counterintuitive finding. It is possible that, as D' Amico (1984) and Carr et al. (1996) suggest, students who work gain greater time management skills, and that students who take early responsibility for their own support may be more responsible in general or may have more serious intentions about college; future work could examine such issues as the role of educational aspirations for these students. However, it is also possible that the variable as measured does not fully capture spending money on necessities; respondents may think of money for education as savings for college, a common reason youth in middle-class families work while still in high school (Steelman and Powell 1991). More detailed measures of adolescents' spending habits and obligations may be better able to determine whether youth in certain types of fragile families are driven to high-intensity work by financial need. Although the hypotheses were not entirely supported, the results do support the more general idea that scholars and policy makers cannot fully understand the risks and problems children face living in fragile families by merely comparing single-parent families to two-parent families and labeling the former as fragile. In other words, not all fiagile families operate in the same way-to paraphrase Tolstoy, perhaps each type of family is fragile in its own way. There are theoretical reasons to believe that youth living in different types of fragile families may be experiencing different family processes and mechanisms related to their family structure. For example, families that are more susceptible to poverty-single-mother families, notably those with minority heads of household-may endure financial pressures that encourage their children to engage in higher-intensity work; on the other hand, members of racial groups that are more commonly in Eragile families may find social capital with others in the same. Families that may not be as susceptible to poverty-such as non-traditional two-parent families, cohabitors and stepparent families-may still have stressors that encourage youth to work longer hours in order to avoid family conflict. Collapsing these family types into single-parent versus two-parent families would obfuscate the actual processes affecting adolescents, hstrating our attempts both to understand and to help them. The idea that we must pay closer attention to different types of fragile families is one that could be applied to many studies about family structure and youth outcomes. For example, the distinct patterns among different types of families found in this study support recent work looking at whether single mother and single father families operate in similar ways. Although previous studies suggested that there may be significant gender-based differences between single mothers and single fathers, most of those assumptions have been based on studies that compare single mother families to two-parent families and conclude that father absence damages children in unique ways. When studies actually compare single mothers to single fathers, they find very few gender-based differences in parenting behaviors and child outcomes (Downey et al. 1998). Future research should take advantage of large-scale, longitudinal data sets such as the NELS or the National Survey of Adolescent Health (Ad-Health) that can both provide information at more than one time point, allowing for better inference about causal connections between family structure and youth outcomes, and provide a large enough sample to allow scholars to look at family structure more finely. Such studies could look at short-term effects of high-intensity work for youth from fragile families, such as the effect of longer work hours on grades and test scores, dropping out of school, attending college, and delinquency and psychosocial effects, as well as long-term effects on outcomes such as family formation, occupational attainment, and college completion. Additional research could look at the effects high-intensity work has on the most fragile of familiesthose in greatest poverty, where putting food on the table may be a consideration for adolescent workers, or those who have engaged in early childbearing and have formed fragile families of their own. Although such data were not available in the NELS, more detailed information on spending habits, financial need, and family stressors could allow for more detailed tests of the mechanisms within different types of fragile families that drive adolescents to work longer hours, possibly putting them at risk for negative academic and behavioral outcomes. Finally, although this study suggests that such mechanisms may operate differently in different fragile family structures, it was not able to fully explain the work habits and teacher assessments of youth in such families. Additional research including the effects of high-intensity work and detailed family structure on youth outcomes could also include other variables of interest that could affect work choices and teacher opinion, such as participation in other extracurricular activities, school social capital, or self concept to see if the effects of growing up in a fragile family could be fully explained."}]
