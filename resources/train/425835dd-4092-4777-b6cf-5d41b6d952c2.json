[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract Recent evidence from both observations and model simulations suggests that an Arctic sea ice reduction tends to cause a negative Arctic Oscillation (AO) phase with severe winter weather in the Northern Hemisphere, which is often preceded by weakening of the stratospheric polar vortex. Although this evidence hints at a stratospheric involvement in the Arctic-midlatitude climate linkage, the exact role of the stratosphere remains elusive. Here we show that tropospheric AO response to the Arctic sea ice reduction largely disappears when suppressing the stratospheric wave mean flow interactions in numerical experiments. The results confirm a crucial role of the stratosphere in the sea ice impacts on the midlatitudes by coupling between the stratospheric polar vortex and planetary-scale waves. Those results and consistency with observation-based evidence suggest that a recent Arctic sea ice loss is linked to midlatitudes extreme weather events associated with the negative AO phase."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "In the global climate system the atmosphere has an important role in connecting climates of different regions, a phenomenon called atmospheric teleconnection, in response to a range of surface boundary conditions. Thus, in investigations of intraseasonal to seasonal climate links between the Arctic and the midlatitudes, it is essential to ask if and how an observed Arctic sea ice loss, by affecting atmospheric circulation aloft, is able to influence weather and climate in remote regions [Deser et al., 2010] . Both observations and numerical simulations have shown that a reduction in the Arctic summer-to-fall sea ice extent, particularly over the Barents-Kara Sea, modulates atmospheric circulation in the subsequent fall-to-winter so as to strengthen the Siberia High, which often brings severe winters to eastern Eurasia [Honda et al., 2009; Overland et al., 2011; Hopsch et al., 2012; Orsolini et al., 2012; Mori et al., 2014] . In addition, when the sea ice cover is low, Northern Hemisphere jets tend to meander, and this meandering often brings anomalously cold weather to the midlatitudes, especially in the Euro-Atlantic sector although there is a debate on this notion especially in terms of the choice of a metric [Francis and Vavrus, 2012; Barnes, 2013; Screen and Simmonds, 2014] . Anomalously, cold winters and meandering jets occur more frequently during the negative phase of the Arctic Oscillation (AO) [Thompson and Wallace, 2001; Barriopedro and GarciaHerrera, 2006; Vavrus et al., 2006] , which is the predominant variability pattern of the Northern Hemisphere winter climate [Thompson and Wallace, 1998 ]. Dynamically, the negative AO phase represents the atmospheric state in which a larger air mass resides over the polar region and is associated with weak westerlies, anomalously meandering jets in the upper troposphere, and anomalous surface weather patterns.\nRecent observational studies have reported that following a summer with a low Arctic sea ice cover, upward propagation of planetary-scale waves is enhanced in late fall and early winter, which leads to a weakened stratospheric polar vortex and subsequent surface signals [Jaiser et al., 2012; King et al., 2015] . On the other hand, modeling studies have also provided supporting evidence for this dynamical process in the stratosphere and troposphere as responses to changes in both sea ice [Orsolini et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2014; Nakamura et al., 2015] and snow boundary conditions [Fletcher et al., 2007; Peings et al., 2012] . Other modeling studies have contradicting results on the AO phase as an Arctic sea ice response [Cai et al., 2012] . [Liu et al., 2012; Wegmann et al., 2015] . Although in principle modeling studies can isolate the impacts of sea ice and snow, few studies to date have used a fully stratosphere-resolving (i.e., high-top) model and explicitly examined the role of the stratosphere in the Arctic-midlatitude climate linkage [e.g., Fletcher et al., 2009] . A recent study based on a high-top model by Sun et al. [2015] found that reduced sea ice in the Arctic would lead to significant modulation of the AO behavior and consequential impacts on the surface climate through stratospheric wave mean flow interactions. However, their focus was on a projected sea ice response in a centennial time scale, and there has been no modeling study examining impacts of an observed rapid Arctic sea ice loss with an attention on stratospheric processes using a high-top model. Nor is there a model study directly investigating the role of stratospheric wave mean flow interactions in the context of the sea ice impacts on midlatitudes climate.\nHere we show that based on numerical experiments using a high-top atmospheric general circulation model [Nakamura et al., 2015] that has already shown sea ice impacts on the stratosphere highly consistent with observations, midlatitude surface signals as a response to the Arctic sea ice reduction disappear when artificially suppressing stratospheric wave mean flow interaction. The results confirm the active role of the stratosphere in the Arctic midlatitude climate linkage. Then, from a posteriori analysis we argue that an observed reduction in sea ice alone can sufficiently affect atmospheric circulation to influence surface climate via the stratospheric pathway."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "The Merged Hadley-National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration/Optimum Interpolation sea surface temperature (SST) and sea ice concentration (SIC) data sets [Hurrell et al., 2008] for the period 1979-2011 were used for the boundary conditions of the model. The model simulated turbulent heat fluxes over ice-covered and open-water grid cells in the Arctic Ocean were comparable to observation-based fluxes.

More detailed description of the experimental settings can be found in our previous paper [Nakamura et al., 2015] . Using the 60 year output of the two runs, which followed an 11 year spin-up, we examined the atmospheric responses to differences in the sea ice conditions. The RS10 experiment differed from FREE in that the zonal mean zonal wind above 10 hPa was restored at every time step by relaxation toward the climatology of the daily annual cycle in the HICE run of FREE with a maximum relaxation timescale of 1 day. Relaxation forcing \u03c4 \u00c01 was zero (\u03c4 = \u221e) at and below the lowest level of 10 hPa and increased linearly up to 1.0 d \u00c01 (\u03c4 = 1 day) at the higher level of 3.16 hPa, and was 1.0 d \u00c01 above that level. The RS30 experiment was the same as RS10 except that the lowest level was 31.6 hPa and the higher level was 10 hPa (Text S1 in the supporting information). Because our experiments restored the zonal mean component of the zonal wind but not the eddy (departure from the zonal mean) component, interaction of the planetary wave and the mean flow was suppressed by damping feedback from the wave to the mean flow rather than by damping the amplitude of the wave itself. By this suppression of wave mean flow interaction, RS10 and RS30 partially emulated the low-top models, which are often used for climate simulations (e.g., phase 3 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project). It should be noted that the restoring force leads small biases in the climatological state (discussed in supporting information Text S2). As an additional check on possible changes in the dominant circulation pattern in the troposphere during our restoring experiments, we examined the first empirical orthogonal function in the Northern Hemisphere troposphere in all experiments and confirmed that the AO pattern was the first dominant mode in all experiments.\nresponse to the sea ice reduction was modified in such a way that the negative AO-like pattern and its associated cold anomalies in the troposphere were much subdued or even absent in the experiments with restored stratospheric circulation. Furthermore, the surface temperature anomalies differ among three experiments except for warm anomalies over ice reduction regions, suggesting large natural fluctuations of the temperature responses that hinder to detect sea ice impacts on the surface [Mori et al., 2014] .\nstratosphere PCH anomalies led by up to 2 weeks, and the tropospheric PCH anomalies lagged on a much shorter timescale; together they indicate slow downward propagation of the stratospheric signal and faster coupling between the lower stratosphere and the troposphere.\nThese signatures were much reduced in RS10. Although similar negative wind anomalies in the stratosphere appeared after some intensification of upward wave propagation in December and January, their amplitudes were smaller, and the signal was less significant compared with the signatures in FREE. Importantly, the signal no longer reached the troposphere (Figures 2a and 2b ). In RS30, there was no significant downward propagation of the stratospheric signal (Figure 2a) . One might think that the stratosphere-troposphere coupling would be weak in the restored experiments. On the contrary, at zero lag stratosphere-troposphere coupling was seen in all three experiments (Figure 2c) . Thus, one of the reasons for the lack of a tropospheric signal in \nRS10 is that the signal in the lower stratosphere was too weak; this was caused by the unrealistically weak amplitudes of the anomalies in the upper stratosphere (supporting information Figure S1b ), which therefore no longer propagated to the lower stratosphere. The fact that the lead-lag structure in the upper stratosphere was degraded in a stepwise manner with restoration ( Figure 2c ) provides strong evidence for an active stratospheric dynamic role and at the same time suggests the importance of the upper stratosphere.\nTo strengthen our case for the critical role of the stratosphere, we examined the details of upward propagation of planetary-scale waves. We note that anomalous upward propagation of planetary-scale waves occurred mainly over eastern Siberia (Figure 3b ) in all three experiments. The colocation of these anomalies with geopotential height anomalies and their respective climatological locations (Figure 3a and supporting information Text S3) indicated that the deepening of the climatological trough over eastern Siberia is key to the anomalous upward propagation of planetary-scale waves. This robustness of the spatial distribution of the upward propagation across the experiments is expected because restoring the zonal winds did not suppress the amplitude of the waves; it only suppressed the interaction of the waves with the mean flow.\nThe upward E-P flux anomaly in January was persistently positive in FREE (purple lines in Figure 2b ), reflecting more frequent occurrence of upward propagating wave packet with longer duration. This suggests the presence of some two-way interactions in which planetary-wave modulation is affected by the stratospheretroposphere coupling process itself (discussed in supporting information Text S4). That is, the anomalous upward wave propagation is not only induced by the tropospheric wave source but also intensified by the stratospheric circulation changes, as has been suggested previously [Harnik, 2009; Nishii et al., 2011] .\ninfluence on atmospheric circulation and onto surface climate via the stratospheric pathway, without invoking indirect impacts from the induced snow cover changes."}, {"section_title": "Statistics and Techniques", "text": "In the individual experiments, we examined the differences in the 60 year averages of LICE minus HICE, in which only the sea ice difference was responsible for the atmospheric anomalies. Statistical significance was examined by a two-tailed standard t test for pairs of the 60 samples. Transformed Eulerian mean diagnostics were used to determine the vertical component of the Eliassen-Palm (E-P) flux (F z ), an indicator of the upward propagation of planetary-wave activity. The 5 day running means of zonal mean zonal wind and F z were used for daily temporal anomalies. The polar cap height (PCH) was defined as geopotential height averaged northward of 65\u00b0N at each pressure level. Variations of the daily mean PCH during the 90 days of winter (December-February) were used to diagnose the vertical coupling intensity in the three experiments. Eddy geopotential heights were defined as departures of the geopotential height from its zonal mean. The three-dimensional E-P flux [Plumb, 1985] was used to diagnose the three-dimensional structure of wave activity in the model."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Different Sea Ice Impacts Due To Representation of the Stratosphere", "text": "We evaluated the simulated responses to sea ice reduction in the Arctic region by subtracting the HICE results from the LICE results. Hereafter, we refer to these differences as anomalies. In the FREE experiment, the geopotential height anomalies in the upper troposphere at 300 hPa averaged over December-February clearly showed the negative AO phase pattern, which is characterized by positive anomalies over the Arctic and negative anomalies in surrounding regions (Figure 1b ). At 2 m height, large negative (cold) air temperature anomalies were found over eastern Siberia, and less significant negative anomalies were seen over the Europe and northeastern North America region (Figure 1c) . These results are highly consistent with observations that following a low summertime sea ice cover in the Arctic, the wintertime AO tends to be in its negative phase, which brings severe winter weather to Eurasia and the North Atlantic sector [Francis and Vavrus, 2012; Barnes, 2013; Cohen et al., 2014; Screen and Simmonds, 2014; Kim et al., 2014; Nakamura et al., 2015; Sun et al., 2015] . In the stratosphere the signal of the negative AO phase was marked in the geopotential height anomalies at 50 hPa ( Figure 1a ).\nWhen restoration was applied, the stratospheric AO signal was not so different (RS10) or was slightly weakened (RS30). In contrast, no clear AO signal at 300 hPa ( Figure 1b ) nor any significant cold anomalies ( Figure 1c ) was seen in eastern Siberia. Instead, a significant cold anomaly was seen over northwestern North America only in RS10.

These components were all clearly identified as responses to sea ice reduction in the FREE experiment. During December-March, an increase in anomalies in the vertical component of the Eliassen-Palm (E-P) flux (F z ) at 100 hPa averaged over the 50-80\u00b0N latitude band (a measure of the upward propagation of planetary-scale wave activity) just prior to a period of negative anomalies in the zonal mean zonal winds at 60\u00b0N in the upper stratosphere was followed 1 to 3 weeks later by downward propagation of the stratospheric signal to the troposphere (Figures 2a and 2b ).

This result may be taken as evidence for snow cover impacts on the surface climate in winter [Fletcher et al., 2007 [Fletcher et al., , 2009 Peings et al., 2012] .

Atmospheric circulation responses to sea ice anomalies vary among different models and experiments, and both positive and negative AO-like responses to the Arctic sea ice changes have been reported [e.g., Screen and Simmonds, 2014; Barnes and Screen, 2015; Sun et al., 2015] . The responses vary depending on an exact period and a region of sea ice anomalies in question (see the discussion in Sun et al. [2015] ). In this context, it is worth stating that our simulation was based on sea ice anomalies representing rapid changes over the last three decades with the strongest influence from the late-fall turbulent heat flux anomalies in the Barents-Kara Seas as discussed in Nakamura et al. [2015] . Within this framework, our results suggest that the observed Arctic sea ice variations, by triggering stratospheric processes, have potential to exert significant weather and climate influences on the Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes. For better understanding of the Arctic midlatitudes climate linkage, a comparison with observations in terms of magnitudes of signals with a careful analysis on combined impacts from different sources and pathways are clearly needed in future. In particular, large part of the differences among the previous results can be traced to a different basic state of the stratosphere and/or a particular phase of the responses relative to climatological stationary-wave structure [Smith et al., 2010; Nishii et al., 2011] , which will be covered in our future work.\nThe present results indicate climate models, which contain the whole stratosphere, are indispensable for realistic climate predictions. The stratosphere now appears to be influenced by various sources. Our results place Arctic sea ice in an already long list of forcings, including tropical sea surface temperature (e.g., El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation), ozone, and greenhouse gases, that can affect the stratospheric polar vortex strength with consequential downward influences on the surface climate [Br\u00f6nnimann et al., 2004; Manzini et al., 2006; Ineson and Scaife, 2009; Kidston et al., 2015] . For better climate predictions, besides a deeper understanding of stratosphere-troposphere coupling mechanisms, there is an urgent need to understand the combined influences of these various sources on the stratosphere."}]
