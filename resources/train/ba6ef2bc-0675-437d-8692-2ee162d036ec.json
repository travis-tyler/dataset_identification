[{"section_title": "CHANGES IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF FARM WEALTH IN THE UNITED STATES", "text": "The adequacy of income and the well-being of the farm business sector have been prominent features of the farm policy debate. Since the early 1950s, the economic well-being of agriculture has varied significantly. Record levels of income and wealth were realized by the sector and many individuals (Mishra and Sandretto) . However, agriculture also realized significant losses in equity, especially in mid 1980s, and saw a major reduction in farm numbers during the period.\nSpecifically, U.S. farm business wealth fell from $379.0 billion in 1981 to $208.1 billion in 1986, a drop of $248.7 billion. This decapitalization of the U.S. farm sector was greatest in three regions: the Lake States, the Corn Belt, and the Northern Plains. These regions not only experienced a combined $171.0 billion loss of farm wealth, but also saw their share of total U.S. farm wealth drop from 46.6 percent in 1981 to 36.8 percent in 1986. Farm price and income support programs implemented in the 1930s were designed to help bring the average farm income to that of average urban households in America (Hallberg) . Historically, the government has focused on stabilizing farm-sector income at levels that are \"equitable\" compared to incomes earned in the nonfarm sector (Robinson; Halcrow) .\nHowever, a true evaluation of equity (both horizontal and vertical) must include a measure of wealth (Hill, 2000) . Hill points out that wealth is important because it gives rise not only to income in a variety of forms but also because it provides security, freedom to maneuver resources, and economic and political power. Within the economy as a whole, wealth seems to be much more unequally distributed than income and has a major influence on the overall degree of inequality (Atkinson). The importance of wealth as a contributor to the economic welfare of farmers cannot be denied, yet it rarely receives mention among agricultural economists.\nExamining the distribution of wealth rests on the relationship between farm assets and equity values, and changes in current and future farm incomes (Melichar) . Equity per farm represents the \"average\" wealth of U.S. farms. Although the average equity per farm is a helpful measure of well-being at a point in time, changes in the national average alone may not reflect significant changes in domestic agriculture. For example, due to a reduction in farm numbers, changes in the distribution of farm size, and the importance of off-farm income over the past six decades, average net worth may not reflect the distribution of farm assets and equity. Therefore, from a policy standpoint it may be more helpful to examine how shares of total farm business sector wealth are distributed over time and across regions and states.\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service develops, interprets, and disseminates farm sector accounts information. This includes estimates of the value of assets used in the sector's production activities, debt associated with these assets, and the value of farm wealth (equity) of the farm business sector. Farm sector capital represents the accumulated stock of real wealth (assets minus debt). Saving and investments add to the capital stock. At the farm level, capital refers to the productive, income-generating assets like farmland, machinery, inventories, and financial assets. For the farm income and balance sheet series, the farm sector is considered as a single entity, with no adjustment made for differences in ownership or business arrangements among farms or other entities comprising the sector. Estimates generated by the farm sector national accounts program are also used to measure changes in farm sector performance and well-being. The amount of wealth held by farm businesses and the rates at which they accumulate it are important indicators of farm business economic well-being and financial progress. Furthermore, the forms in which wealth is held provide a good measure of how responsive farm businesses can be in meeting financial crises.\nWe use the Theil's measure of inequality to examine changes in U.S. farm wealth for the period 1950 through 1999. The entropy-based measure quantifies the inequality of farm equity by state for the U.S. The measure decomposes the U.S. inequality into between-region differences and within-region differences using Economic Research Service (ERS) production regions."}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "This study uses farm equity measures from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Economic Research Service's (USDA, ERS) latest revised and updated state-level balance sheet data. These equity data are from the aggregate sector balance sheet statistics. Specifically, equity is the sector-wide measure of assets held in the sector (without regard to ownership) minus the sector- increase in the value of farmland in the U.S. from $10,000 to $300,000 per farm. However, during the farm financial crisis period, the value of farmland declined to $219,000 per farm (1986) and pushed farm equity down to $251,000. Since 1986, average equity per farm has increased from $251,000 in 1986 to about $429,000 in 1999 as farmers reduced their debt and assets values increased substantially (Figure 1 ). Regional data show that the increase in equity per farm was not uniform within the U.S. Figure 2 represents the average equity per farm for 3 of the 10 regions between 1950-1999. Trends in these three regions (major farming regions) display changes in farm wealth similar, but not identical, to the U.S. average. Figure 2 shows that U.S. farms lost nearly $250 billion in wealth in the farm financial crisis period (1981) (1982) (1983) (1984) (1985) (1986) . "}, {"section_title": "Theil's Measure of Inequality (TMI)", "text": "The use of entropy in statistics has its origin in information theory. Shannon's (1948) measure of uncertainty was introduced as a measure of dispersion. Theil's measure of inequality (TMI) expands the basic concept of information by using Shannon's 1 third requirement, additivity of the information index. To obtain the dispersion index for a distribution, we use class frequencies or probabilities.\nTheil's inequality is a statistical measure of dispersion or entropy where entropy is the expected information in a message or signal. Let p be the probability, 0#p#1, of an event E. Suppose that a signal is received that E did occur. The information contained in that signal is inversely related to p. If an event is unlikely (has a smaller p) then that E occurred has more information than an event occurring that is more likely (has a large p). For example, if the probability is 0.95 and information is received that the event occurred then that information carries little information.\nBut is the probability were 0.05 then the information that the event did indeed occur would contain a great deal of information.\nAssume a set of n mutually exclusive events E 1 , E 2 ,\u2026\u2026. E n with initial probabilities p 1, p 2 ,\u2026\u2026 p n and a second set of probabilities, probabilities q 1, q 2 ,\u2026\u2026 q n , that are analogous to the posterior probabilities from Bayesian statistics. Given two set of probabilities, the TMI (Theil 1967 ) is\nIntuitively, TMI captures the expected value of the information in the second signal. If the first and second probabilities are equal for all events, then I(p,q)=0. This implies that there is no information in the second signal not contained in the first. As the two probabilities diverge, the natural log of their ratios becomes different from zero. If the initial probability is large relative to increasing function of n, and (3) if the uncertainty could be broken down into two successive probabilities (p i , q i ), then the overall measure of the entropy should be the weighted average of the two successive events. the second probability, p i > q i , then the natural log of the ratio is positive. Alternatively, if the first probability is smaller than the second probability, p i < q i , then the natural log of the ratio is negative. However, due to the concavity of ln(X) the TMI has a lower bound at zero and no upper bound.\nThe TMI is consistent with basic income inequality measures, such as the Lorenz measure. As\nFoster points out, a measure of inequality must satisfy certain basic properties. First, the inequality measure must increase when wealth is transferred from poor to rich. Also, the measure should be symmetric and homogeneous of degree zero. The TMI satisfies these basic criteria.\nOther dispersion measures, such as the coefficient of variation or the variance of logarithms, fail to satisfy all of the criteria. In addition, the decomposability property of TMI makes the TMI unique among all measures that satisfy the basic criteria.\nThe application of TMI in the current situation follows the basic inequality studies of Theil, Gao et al., Moss and Mulkey, and others. The p i is the probability that a farm is from a given state, measured simply as the number of farms in that state divided by the total number of farms in the country. The q i is the probability that a dollar of equity 2 is from a given state, which is the dollars of equity from that state divided by the national amount of farm equity. If the probability based on the farm numbers is close to the probability based on farm equity, then there is little additional information and the TMI is small. Finally, a small inequality means that the distribution of farm wealth is uniform across states and vice versa. Further, additivity of the measure allows for the analysis of inequality between regions of the country. This study focuses on the national, regional, and average within region inequality."}, {"section_title": "Regional Decomposition", "text": "The basic notion of decomposition of the inequality measure (TMI) is that the total inequality can be decomposed into inequality between regions and the average inequality within each region. Specifically, define P f and Q f to be\nwhere P f is the probability of farm numbers and Q f is the probability of farm equity for a given region, that is, the state within the farming regions. Additionally, inequality across regions can be defined from equation 1 as\nThe measure of inequality within each farming region can then be defined as\nFinally, overall inequality in equation 1 can be decomposed as: I = I R + I A where I A =3 P f I f is the average inequality within regions. There are two major advantages of TMI over other measures of inequality. First, the TMI provides a descriptive measure of the distribution of farm wealth that measures inequality of equity per farm weighted by the farm population. This is particularly important given structural changes in the agricultural sector. Second, a major advantage of the TMI is its empirical decomposition of national-level inequality. The measures of betweenregions inequality, I R , and the average-within region inequality, I A , indicate whether the national inequality in the distribution of farm wealth is due to variation between states, within regions or between the individual regions."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "In interpreting the results it is important to note that there have been considerable changes in the composition of farms, including in the size distribution of farms (Erickson, et al.) . Furthermore, there have also been important changes in products/commodities produced, in methods of production (e.g., machinery, equipment, buildings and other capital assets like nursery and animal production facilities, and in the allocation of operator and family labor among different employment activities). Therefore, a dollar of equity may have been generated by a considerably different set of asset and debt instruments than in the 1990s. Furthermore, the number and distribution of farms by state and region have changed significantly over this period. So in interpreting these results, based as they are on within-and between-region changes in equity per farm and in the number of farms, we must consider the impacts of these structural changes.\nIn general, the results indicate that farm equity in the U.S. has changed. Now its distribution by state is more consistent with the distribution of farms by state. Most dramatic convergence occurred between 1950 and 1975. During this period steadily rising farm incomes, particularly in areas with supported commodities like cash grains and dairy, resulted to a more equal distribution of wealth, both nationally and regionally. Growing farm exports and accommodating farm credit policies also contributed to this convergence. From 1976 From -1999 changes in inequality were minimal. An increasing number of small farms with minimal debt and increased off-farm incomes also brought outside equity into agriculture.\nThe estimates of (TMI) of wealth inequality nationally (I), regionally (I R ), and the average within-regions (I A ) are presented in Figure 5 . During the 1962-1992 period, agriculture in the U.S. went through significant structural changes.\nThe number of farms declined and the average size of farm increased (through consolidation).\nThese changes were partly due to a more open and globalized world economy, to greater mobility of capital and labor, and to deregulation of capital markets. This expansion/consolidation of agriculture resulted in a more even distribution of wealth across the states relative to the number of farms in each state. The between-region results show the major part of this increased equality as a between-region move toward equality rather than withinregion. This also demonstrates that regions that were losing their share of farms relative to other regions were maintaining or even increasing their share of equity.\nThe national inequality of equity increased from its lowest level (2.4%) in 1993 to 17.4% in 1999. Much of this inequality can be attributed to within-region inequality. Within-region inequality of equity increased from 2.4% in 1993 to 12.4% in 1999. Also, it is worth noting that the share of land in total farm business assets increased from 74% to 77% during the same period (Mishra, Moss, and Erickson) . On the other hand, between-region inequality of equity increased from 4.1% in 1993 to 5.7% in 1994. Since then between-region inequality of equity has averaged around 5.5%."}, {"section_title": "Within-Region Inequality", "text": "Estimates of within-region inequality of equity, I f (equation 4) for 10 regions are presented in Figure 6 , 7, and 8. and almost 30% in 1999."}, {"section_title": "Summary and Conclusions", "text": "Over the past five decades economic well-being of agriculture has varied significantly. In the 1950s and early part of 1960s farmers benefited from rising prices and incomes. The 1970s saw unprecedented growth in the world and domestic demand for farm products. However, agriculture also recorded significant losses in equity during the farm crisis period (1979) (1980) (1981) (1982) (1983) (1984) and a major reduction in farm numbers in past several decades. A change in farm equity is related to changes in farm assets and debts. Farm policies, production controls, subsidized credit, and income transfers affect the level of farm assets and debts. This study analyzed changes in farm wealth that have occurred across states and regions within the U.S. between 1950 and 1999.\nSpecifically, it applied Theil's measure of income inequality to state-level farm equity data to measure the variation in wealth across states and production regions.\nResults from this study show that the largest inequalities were in early 1950's and early 1960's.\nFurther, the largest convergence in farm equity occurred from 1960 to 1992. A reduction in interregional variations contributed to this convergence. In general, more recently reduction in number of farms slowed down and data show an increase in the number o f small farms. Net worth (farm and non-farm) in all regions increased. Farms in Midwest regions recovered all their lost equity. Starting in 1993 we observe a small rise in the inequality of wealth, both at the national and regional level (within-region inequality has been stable). Further, changes in the farm numbers appeared well matched to changes in equity. During this period (1993) (1994) (1995) (1996) (1997) (1998) (1999) the sector recorded highest incomes (1994, 1996, 1997) while government support payments were reduced for many commodities. However, in recent years non-farm equity, such as increase in number of small farms with no debt, and increased off-farm income have produced a stable wealth structure in the agricultural sector.\nAlthough this decomposition of variation in farm wealth is helpful in explaining the extent to which microeconomic (within-regions) and macroeconomic (structural and government program-related) factors underlie changes in the distribution of farm wealth over time.\nFurther, analysis is needed to understand how farm structure, government programs, and microeconomic forces interact to affect farm sector wealth and well-being. Farm-level data, such as that provided by the Agricultural Resources Management Survey (ARMS) may be useful in further explaining these changes. The ARMS gathers data not only on the farm business sector, but also on the financial well-being of the farm households. Because this survey collects data on farms by type of farm, by size class, by tenure arrangement, and by other important structural characteristics, it may be used to further explain changes not only in farm business wealth, but also in farm household wealth.
