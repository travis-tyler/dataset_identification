[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Heritability estimates in major depressive disorder (MDD) are of the order of 48-75%.\n1 A potential candidate gene is the brainderived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) polymorphism which has been linked with an increased incidence of MDD. 2 The BDNF protein is the most common of the neurotrophins and has an important role in synaptic plasticity, neurogenesis, neural growth and differentiation.\n3,4 A common single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at codon 66 of the BDNF gene results in a valine to methionine (Val66Met) substitution, which has a functional impact on cellular packaging, transportation and secretion, and the neurotrophic model proposes that decreased BDNF expression contributes to the development of depression. 5 Brain-derived neurotrophic factor is widely distributed within key regions in the neural circuitry of affective processing and in major depressive disorder, including in the anterior cingulate, prefrontal regions, hippocampus and amygdala. 6 However, effects of the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism in healthy individuals have been variable. In subcortical limbic regions, reduced volumes of the hippocampus, 7,8 and amygdala, 8 as well as no significant difference, 9,10 have been reported in a Met carrier group relative to a Val homozygous group. In prefrontal regions, individuals who were Met carriers showed reduced middle and inferior frontal cortical volumes, 7,11 although no significant difference has been found in orbitofrontal volumes.\nFew studies have examined the effect of the BDNF polymorphism in depression; the main region of interest to date has been the hippocampus which has shown mixed findings, with reduced volume in people who are Met carriers, 10,13 as well as reduced and increased volume in those homozygous for Val, 14, 15 whereas previously we found no difference between genotypes. 16 However, studies in depression have been limited in their sample characteristics: absence of a healthy control group, 13 specified regions of interest (namely, hippocampus and amygdala), 10, [14] [15] [16] and measures of white-matter tracts only. 17, 18 Moreover, the majority of studies have measured regional grey-matter, including grey-matter density. The determinants of grey-matter volume of a given cortical region are its surface area and cortical thickness, which have distinct developmental and genetic origins.\nVolumetric alterations are thus a product of independent or concurrent disparities in the two constituents. In a healthy sample Yang et al found a broad distribution of reduced cortical thickness in Chinese adults who were homozygous for Met compared with those homozygous for Val. 20 To our knowledge, BDNF Val66Met modulation of cortical thickness and surface area has not been investigated in MDD.\nWe sought to examine the effects of the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism on the neurocircuitry of depression, in particular the amygdala and the prefrontal regions of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), middle frontal and orbitofrontal cortices. We investigated the modulatory effects on regional brain volume and its components of surface area and cortical thickness. We expected to observe an effect of Met carrier status in reduced cortical volume in the middle frontal cortices, 7, 11 and perhaps in the corresponding cortical thickness, 20 in healthy participants, whereas it was uncertain whether the impact of the polymorphism would be sustained in MDD.\nThe study was conducted in the UK and approved by the ethics research committee of the Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London; all participants provided written informed consent.

The analysis involved removal of non-brain tissue using a hybrid watershed/surface deformation procedure, automated Talairach transformation, segmentation of the subcortical white-matter and deep grey-matter volumetric structures, intensity normalisation, tessellation of the grey matter-white matter boundary, automated topology correction and surface deformation following intensity gradients to optimally place the grey/white and grey/cerebrospinal fluid borders at the location where the greatest shift in intensity defined the transition to the other tissue class. Once the cortical models were complete, registration to a spherical atlas took place using individual cortical folding patterns to match cortical geometry across individuals. This was followed by parcellation of the cerebral cortex into units based on gyral and sulcal structures (see online Fig. DS1 ). The pipeline generated 68 cortical thickness, cortical volume, surface area, mean curvature, gaussian curvature, folding index and curvature index measures (34 from each hemisphere) and 46 regional subcortical volumes. All volumetric measures from each participant were normalised by the participant's intracranial volume; cortical thickness measures were not normalised.\nAs a priori hypotheses, only the following regions were examined: amygdala, anterior cingulate (rostral and caudal ACC), middle frontal cortex (rostral and caudal) and orbitofrontal cortex (medial and lateral) bilaterally. A multivariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) in SPSS version 21 was used to assess differences between the MDD group and the control group and also between those homozygous for Val and those classified as Met carriers (Val/Met and Met/Met genotypes). False discovery rate (FDR) was used to adjust for multiple comparisons resulting from the ANOVA models with a = 0.05. 27 "}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Modulatory effects of the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism as well as genotype by diagnosis interactions were revealed in key nodes in the neurocircuitry of MDD.

Our study extends both the observation by Yang et al in healthy Chinese adults, 20 and the original finding, 7 by localising the contribution of cortical thinning to the reductions in caudal middle frontal volume. Moreover, this is the first report of the extent that Met carrier status leads to middle frontal cortical thinning, as the effect of the Met allele appears to supersede the disease process effects of MDD on cortical thickness. Grey-matter reductions in the caudal middle frontal region have been frequently observed in MDD, with further reductions in recurrent MDD. 28 Our findings indicate that the impact of the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism on cortical thinning in the caudal middle frontal region is even greater than that of recurrent MDD. It is possible that the influence of the Met allele in this region may not necessarily be causal in itself for MDD, but may be a predisposing, contributory History of suicide attempt, n (%) 14 (42) 19 (41) History of ECT, n (%) 2 (6) 4 (9) History of hospital admissions, n (%) 9 (27) 13 (28) Current antidepressant medication, n (%) 26 (79) 32 (70) BDI, Beck Depression Inventory; ECT, electroconvulsive therapy; MDD, major depressive disorder; STAI, State Trait Anxiety Inventory. a. There was no significant difference between the two groups for any of the measures.\nfactor in association with other neurogenic effects. Stress is linked to an increase in cortisol, which in turn causes a reduction in BDNF. 29 Individuals who are Met carriers are less able to compensate for this BDNF reduction owing to deficient transport of the BDNF preprotein which causes clumping around the nucleus, perhaps leading to neuronal atrophy in response to reduced BDNF levels. 4, 5 We also observed a significant interaction effect in surface area in the caudal anterior cingulate and rostral middle frontal cortices. The anterior cingulate and middle frontal cortices are key regions in the neurocircuitry of mood disorders, and the anterior cingulate is a well-replicated predictive marker of clinical response in MDD, 30 which is evident at the individual level. 31 Surface area and cortical thickness have independent genetic and developmental origins. 19 The radial unit hypothesis proposes that cortical thickness is determined by the number of cells within a neuronal column, and cortical surface area is determined by the number of neuronal columns. 32 There is support for a general regional expansion of surface area from childhood into adolescence, particularly in boys, 33 followed by subsequent decreases in adulthood with increasing age, 34 whereas cortical thinning is a pronounced feature of adolescence that continues into adulthood. 33 There is, however, some notable variability in the regional changes, 33, 34 for example the surface area of the anterior cingulate cortex may show relatively fewer changes in adulthood. 33 Modulation of grey-matter density by the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism in both the anterior cingulate and middle frontal cortices has been found in bipolar disorder, 35 and in the anterior cingulate in healthy individuals with a history of childhood abuse, 12 whereas no prefrontal regional effect has been reported in schizophrenia. 36 Our study localises the genetic influence to cortical surface area in its contribution to grey-matter volume, which had not been examined in previous studies in patient populations. 35, 36 It is possible that the surface area reduction we observed is an endophenotype for MDD, or more generally for mood disorders including bipolar disorder, or it may also be a feature in schizophrenia that has not been well captured by morphometric studies to date. The lack of an association of BDNF with schizophrenia, 37 however, suggests that the effect may be more strongly expressed in mood disorders."}, {"section_title": "Effects on amygdala volume", "text": "Contrary to our hypothesis, no significant interaction effect was found in the grey-matter volume of the amygdala. Our observations are consistent with findings in healthy individuals carrying the BDNF Met allele with a history of childhood adversity and in depression, 10, 12 but there have also been reports of reduced amygdala volume in healthy people with and without a history of stressful events. 8, 31 Similarly, studies of amygdala responsivity have been mixed, with reports of significant effects, 38, 39 but more frequently of no impact, 9, 40, 41 of the BDNF polymorphism. The literature on amygdala volume in depression, however, is inconsistent, with some suggestion that amygdala volume is reduced in more chronic forms of depression. 42 In our study, participants had a history of recurrent depression characterised by discrete acute depressive episodes with periods of euthymia rather than a more chronic, treatment-resistant type of depression. Our findings are most comparable with those of Frodl et al, who similarly did not observe any effect of diagnosis or BDNF genotype on amygdala volume. 10 "}, {"section_title": "Study limitations", "text": "We limited our analysis to a priori defined regions in the prefrontal cortex and the amygdala within the neurocircuitry of depression. However, our sample size was relatively modest and replication in an independent sample is required. Cortical thinning in the medial orbitofrontal region has been reported in first-episode depression, 43 and in a younger cohort of patients with MDD (mean age 34 years) than in our study. 44 Although there was evidence of left medial orbitofrontal cortical thinning in MDD patients relative to healthy controls in our sample, this difference did not survive correction for multiple comparisons. Furthermore, BDNF Val66Met effects have also been observed in the temporal and parietal cortices in healthy Chinese adults. 20 There may also be a modulatory effect of early life stress, as healthy individuals carrying the Met allele with a history of greater stressful events have shown reduced grey-matter volume in the amygdala and hippocampus, 45 and also in the anterior cingulate cortex, 12 compared with a group homozygous for Val. Another limitation of our study is the absence of data on the history of possible childhood trauma in our participants, although it is unclear whether these effects would persist alongside the pathophysiological effects of the illness. Moreover, most of the participants with MDD were taking antidepressant medication, which may have had an effect on BDNF levels, 5 and in turn potentially on neural volumes. 46 The anterior cingulate region has been consistently identified as a predictive marker of clinical response, 30 and the BDNF polymorphism has shown an association with treatment response. 47 Furthermore, an interaction effect of BDNF and its high-affinity receptor, neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor 2 (NTRK2), gene polymorphisms has been associated with the development of treatment-resistant depression. 48 How these potentially complementary markers may interact at a neural level in predicting clinical response requires further investigation. Neural correlates of BDNF associations with clinical response in a sample of patients who were medication-free and perhaps in their first episode of depression would elucidate the effects of medication, recurrent episodes of depression and prediction of clinical response."}, {"section_title": "Concluding remarks", "text": "In summary, we demonstrated sustained effects of the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism on distinct subregions in the prefrontal cortex in depression. The effects in the caudal middle frontal regions exceeded those of the illness as Met carrier status was associated with greater cortical thinning in both MDD and control groups. Effects in the anterior cingulate and rostral middle frontal regions revealed an interaction with BDNF Val66Met genotype, in which the MDD Met carrier group showed the greatest reduction in surface area. Our findings specify the anterior cingulate and middle frontal regions as key regions within the neurotrophin hypothesis of depression. "}]
