These measurements are recorded from cubic subdivisions of the brain roughly a few millimeters in size called voxels. Averaging the BOLD signal time series across voxels within specified regions provides coarser representations. Functional connectivity analysis (FC) examines functional similarities between time series pairs in specified voxels or regions (Sporns, 2010; Biswal et al., 1995; Friston, 1994) . Functional brain network analysis serves as a distinct subfield of connectivity analysis in which functional associations are quantified for all time series pairs to create an interconnected representation of the brain (a brain 8 network). The resulting connection matrix is generally thresholded to create a 8 \u201a 8 binary adjacency matrix that retains \"significant\" connections while removing weaker ones. Weighted (continuous) network analyses, which we focus on here, have gained traction but still lag behind due to computational and methodological challenges they pose (Telesford et al., 2011; Rubinov and Sporns, 2011; Ginestet et al., 2011) . The connection matrix is still often thresholded to remove negative connections (for reasons noted in Telesford et al., 2011; and others) and/or weak connections in the continuous case. A schematic exhibiting this network generation process is presented in Figure 1 .\nThis emerging area of fMRI brain network analysis allows studying the brain as a system, providing profound clinical insight into the link between system level properties and behavioral and health outcomes (Biswal et al., 2010; Sporns, 2010; Bullmore and Sporns, 2009; Bassett and Bullmore, 2009 ). The application of network science (an interdisciplinary offshoot of graph theory) has facilitated these analyses and our understanding of how the brain is structurally and functionally organized. Both binary and weighted versions of graph metrics such as degree, clustering coefficient, path length, efficiency, centrality, and modularity serve as common descriptive topological properties of interest. While network science has catalyzed a paradigmatic shift in neuroscience, methods for statistically modeling and comparing groups of networks have lagged behind (Simpson et al., 2013a) . These comparisons have great appeal for researchers interested in gaining further insight into complex brain function and how it changes across different mental states and disease conditions. Most current approaches to modeling and comparing brain networks either rely on a specific extracted summary metric (e.g., clustering coefficient) which may lack clinical use due to low sensitivity and specificity, or on mass-univariate nodal or edge-based comparisons that ignore the inherent topological properties of the network while also yielding little power to determine significance (Zalesky et al., 2010; Ginestet et al., 2014) . While some univariate approaches like the network-based statistic (NBS) (Zalesky et al., 2010) have proven useful, gleaning deeper insights into normal and abnormal changes in complex functional organization demands methods that leverage the wealth of data present in an entire brain network. This systemic organization confers much of our brains' functional abilities as functional connections may be lost due to an adverse health condition but compensatory connections may develop as a result in order to maintain organizational consistency and functional performance. Consequently, brain network analysis necessitate a multivariate modeling framework that allows assessing the effects of multiple variables of interest and topological network features (e.g., demographics, disease status, nodal clustering, nodal centrality, etc.) on the overall network structure. "}, {"section_title": ") )", "text": "network structure.\nMore recent brain network comparison methods that attempt to better exploit the topological features of network data include the exponential random graph modeling framework (ERGM) (Simpson et al., , 2012 , the permutation network framework (PNF) (Simpson et al., 2013b) , and the multivariate distance matrix regression (MDMR) framework (Shehzad et al., 2014) . While all show promise, they lack the flexibility of the modeling and inferential tools developed for fMRI activation data. The ERGM framework allows efficiently representing complex network data and inherently accounts for higher order dependence/topological properties, but multiple-subject comparisons can pose problems given that these models were originally developed for the modeling of one network at a time . Moreover, the amount of programming work increases linearly with the number of subjects since ERGMs must be fitted and assessed for each subject individually (Simpson et al., 2012) . Incorporating novel metrics (perhaps more rooted in brain biology) may be difficult due to degeneracy issues that may arise (Handcock, 2002; Rinaldo et al., 2009; O'Malley, 2013) . While well-suited for substructural assessments, edge-level examinations remain difficult with these models.\nAdditionally, most ERGM developments have been for binary networks; approaches for weighted networks have been proposed but remain in their infancy (Krivitsky, 2012; Desmarais and Cranmer, 2012) . The PNF approach enables comparing groups of brain networks by assessing the topological consistency of key node sets within and between groups. However, it is a strictly inferential (and not modeling) approach, and thus precludes quantifying and predicting relationships between disease outcomes and network structure, and simulating network structure. Unlike the PNF, the MDMR framework allows controlling for confounding covariates in group comparisons via a \"psuedo-F\" statistic; however, it too lacks the ability to simulate networks or make predictions. It also fails to account for the dependence in connectivity patterns across voxels.\nTo address the limitations of the current methods, we propose a two-part mixed-effects modeling framework that allows modeling both the probability of a connection (presence/absence of an edge) and the strength of a connection if it exists. Models within this framework enable quantifying the relationship between an outcome (e.g., disease status) and connectivity patterns in the brain while reducing spurious correlations through inclusion of confounding covariates. The models provide a means to test for overall group differences in the strength and probability of network connections, group differences in network topology, and individual edge differences (edge covariates can be easily implemented in the model) while accounting for the complex dependence structures of the networks. They also enable prediction about an outcome based on connectivity structure and vice versa, simulating networks to gain a better understanding of normal ranges of topological variability, and thresholding networks leveraging group information. In short, this multivariate statistical and network scientific fusion approach allows going beyond just reporting an omnibus group comparison p-value and enables a more thorough examination of system level properties.\nFor the following discussion of the two-part mixed-effects modeling framework, we describe the motivating data concerning age-related cognitive decline in Section 2. We detail our modeling approach and its utility in Section 3 and use the aging data to illustrate the use of the proposed framework in Section 4. We conclude with a summary discussion including planned future research in Section 5."}, {"section_title": "MOTIVATING EXAMPLE", "text": "Our data come from a prior study that aimed to assess the neurological underpinnings of age-related cognitive decline by examining the effects of aging on the integration of sensory information .

See Section 3.2.1 for detailed interpretations of each parameter.\nAs evidenced by the magnitude of the estimates in the table relative to their standard errors, global efficiency (Functional Integration) and leverage centrality (Information Flow) play an important role in explaining the presence of connections between two brain regions across task conditions, while clustering (Functional Segregation) serves as a relatively important factor in the strength of these connections. Clustering also proves important in brain connectivity for young adults, but not older adults, during the visual and multisensory tasks. Spatial distance well predicts connection probability and strength across task conditions."}, {"section_title": "Compare", "text": "In addition to simply quantifying the relationship between covariates and the presence and strength of connections while reducing spurious correlations through inclusion of confounding covariates, this framework also allows making formal statistical comparisons about connectivity, network structure, edge properties between groups and (e.g., young vs. old, healthy vs. diseased, etc.).

More specifically, older adults have stronger connections between nodes with higher clustering, global efficiency, and leverage centrality values, and weaker overall connection strength with higher overall modularity than young adults."}, {"section_title": "Predict", "text": "Our approach enables making predictions about brain function in several ways:\n1) Predictions about the and of connections between brain regions presence strength based on a disease or behavioral outcome of a participant can be made by \"learning\" the model parameters (estimating the s) and then using this estimated model for predictions \" based on new data, thus providing a quantitative means to improve diagnoses, prognoses, and treatment planning;\n2) Predictions about the topological relationships between network metrics and the presence strength and of connections based on participant characteristics;\n3) Predictions about network structure and its variability via simulations of networks based on model fits (see Section 3.2.4).\nGiven our research interest for the aging data, we focus on the latter two. In Section 4.3 we focus on 2) for the example data, with a discussion of making predictions about network structure and its variability reserved for sections 3.2.4 and 4.4.\nHere we illustrate the utility of the modeling framework for prediction with the aging study data by focusing on degree 5 difference. Predictions based on other network metrics can be done similarly. Figures 2-7 show the 95% prediction intervals for connection probability and strength as a function of degree difference in young and older participants at rest, during the visual task, and during the multisensory task. The 95% prediction interval provides a model-based definition of normal range for both groups. In contrast to confidence intervals which yield an (narrower) interval estimate for an average of participants, the prediction interval gives an interval estimate for a single participant.\nAs can be seen from Figure 2 , older adults have a higher predicted connection probability when two nodes have the same degree; however, this probability drops off at a slightly faster rate than for the young as the disparity between the degrees of two nodes increases at rest and during a visual task. That is, older adults are predicted to have brain networks that are more degree assortative than young adults at rest. Contrastingly, Figures 4 and 6 show that younger adults are predicted to have more degree assortative networks during visual and multisensory tasks given the faster decay of their connection probabilities. As noted in the previous section, this finding is consistent with the hypothesis that older adults tend to be more distractable, or be more cognitively vulnerable, while engaged in a task. As evidenced by Figures 3, 5 , and 7, older adults have a lower predicted connection strength that parallels the decay of the young adults as the disparity between the degrees of two nodes increases at rest, during a visual task, and during a multisensory task. That is, an older adult is likely to have weaker coupling between brain region pairs than a young adult regardless of the regional connectivity patterns."}, {"section_title": "Simulate", "text": "The two-part mixed modeling framework can also be used to simulate random realizations of networks that retain constitutive characteristics of the original networks.\nThe fitted model yields both a probability mass function for the likelihood of network connections (Equation 2) and probability density function for the strength distribution of network connections (Equation 3) given the covariates. Consequently, group-and individual-level networks can be simulated from this joint distribution, by following the approach of Song et al. (2013) for example, providing a number of benefits delineated below.\nTo assess the goodness-of-fit of our model to the aging study data, and to illustrate the utility of our framework for simulating realistic brain networks, we simulated 100 networks based on the fitted models to the data at rest, during the visual task, and during the multisensory task. We then calculated several (weighted) descriptive metrics commonly used in the neuroimaging literature for the observed and simulated networks. modularity ( ). As evidenced by the results, the simulated networks are very similar to U the observed networks in terms of clustering, path length, and global efficiency, and relatively similar for leverage centrality and degree across task conditions. While the simulated networks are not as similar for modularity, our method provides a huge step forward methodologically given that, to our knowledge, it is the only approach that allows the simulation of weighted networks that capture several important topological properties simultaneously. Moreover, the framework serves as a foundation upon which future work can further refine network simulation accuracy."}, {"section_title": "1) Model goodness-of-fit (GOF) assessment(s) aligned with the research question(s) of", "text": "interest: Simulations allow assessing many facets of model fit by comparing a set of descriptive metrics (means, medians, distributions, etc.) from the simulated networks with those of the observed networks.

Also unlike the ERGM approach, it enables refining the process through the inclusion of additional biologically relevant variables and anatomical information.\n3) Network variability assessment: Insight into biological variability can be gleaned via the distribution of possible brain networks produced from the simulations. These analyses can aid in elucidating network level features that play a role in various brain disorders.\nFor instance, our aging study analyses showed that young subjects have more degree assortative networks during the visual and multisensory tasks. We can empirically examine how this difference affects the variability of simulated networks, thus helping to illuminate neurological mechanisms that lead to age-related cognitive decline (e.g., lack\nof interconnectivity among high degree brain areas leads to less stability in neuronal communication in the brains of older adults).\nThe validity of the results from 2) and 3) (as well as most other subsequent analyses)\nrequire a good fitting model, thus we focus on 1) here."}, {"section_title": "Threshold", "text": "As noted in Section 3.1, additional covariates can be included as guided by the questions of interest. As a consequence, this framework provides a powerful approach to network thresholding via inclusion of dyadic indicator variables. Given the sensitivity of network topology (and subsequent network analyses) to the thresholding process, approaches that refine this process are paramount (Simpson et al., 2013a; van Wijk et al., 2010) . As opposed to most approaches which just use individual participant-level data to threshold a network (Telesford et al., 2011) , our framework allows leveraging group-level data for this purpose. Better distinguishing between \"true\" weak connections and those resulting from noise may mitigate some of the challenges associated with weighted network analysis and provide more confidence in resulting conclusions (Simpson et al., 2013a ).\nImplementing the group-level thresholding approach requires adding indicator variables for the dyads of interest to the strength model defined in Equation 3 and then appropriately assessing the significance of the associated parameter. Adding interactions of the grouping variable (e.g., age group in our case) and the dyads of interest allows leveraging the data in a particular group, as opposed to all groups, in assessing the significance of a dyad. Non-significant dyads can be considered candidates for removal from the networks of participants with weak connections in those areas.

More specifically, older adults are less likely to have connections between nodes with higher clustering, global efficiency, and leverage centrality values, and more likely to have connections between nodes with a greater degree difference (less assortative) than younger adults. The age-related differences in the overall strength of connections vary by dyadic leverage centrality.

More specifically, older adults are less likely to have connections between nodes with higher clustering, and more likely to have connections between nodes with a greater degree difference (less assortative) than young adults. The age-related differences in the overall strength of connections vary by dyadic global efficiency and leverage centrality. More specifically, connection strengths increase faster for older adults between nodes as dyadic global efficiency and leverage centrality values increase. Additionally, older women have more overall connection strength than older men.\nThese comparison results provide a fairly comprehensive appraisal of structural differences between young and older adults. While plausible biological interpretations would be quite speculative at this point, the less degree assortative network structure in older adults during the visual and multisensory tasks provides a more explicable finding.\nDegree assortativity implies the existence of a resilient core of interconnected high-degree hubs (highly connected brain regions). During the performance of a task, the high degree nodes are those that belong to task-relevant networks (Moussa et al., 2011; Rzucidlo et al., 2013; Ma et al., 2012; . The loss of assortativity in the older adults during the tasks suggests that there is reduced connectivity within the task-relevant networks and greater connectivity to other network nodes. This finding is consistent with cognitive studies showing that older adults are more vulnerable to distraction when performing tasks (Alain and Woods, 1999; Darowski et al., 2008; Grady et al., 2006) ."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "The recent explosion of brain network analyses has led to a paradigm shift in neuroscience; however, the statistical methods needed to draw deeper biological insights from these analyses have lagged behind. Our two-part mixed-effects modeling framework fills this void and provides a comprehensive approach to studying system level brain properties to further our understanding of normal and abnormal brain function as illustrated by our analysis of the aging study data. As detailed in Section 3.2, the approach allows explaining the relationship between covariates and network connectivity, comparing predicting network connectivity among groups, network connectivity based on participant and nodal characteristics, networks as a means of assessing simulating goodness-of-fit (GOF) and gaining a better understanding of network topological variability, and networks leveraging group information. thresholding Future work within this framework will focus on further demonstrating its simulation capabilities and thoroughly assessing its utility as a network thresholding aid as discussed in Section 3.2.5. Generating accurate and informative representative group-based networks via simulation provides one avenue for inquiry that has been underexplored in the literature (Simpson et al., 2012) . Additionally, creating signature networks via individual and group-level simulations and examining the subsequent distributions of these generated networks may prove useful in disease prediction. For example, we plan to apply our approach to data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) to determine if simulated networks and their distributions at baseline are predictive of cognitive decline at follow up.\nModifications and extensions to our framework also provide opportunities for future research. Longitudinal (or multitask) brain network modeling remains an untapped area in need of development (Simpson et al., 2013a) . Extending our static modeling approach to this domain via incorporation of time-dependent random effects or Kronecker product covariance modeling (Galecki, 1994; Naik and Rao, 2001; Simpson, 2010; Simpson et al., 2014a; Simpson et al., 2014b ) provides a potential solution. For the latter, following the notation in equations 2 and 3, we could assume that the random error is distributed\nis the variability of connections strengths across the network dyads and varies by task, contains the correlations between > tasks, and contains the correlations between connection strengths of dyads which may H be modeled explicitly or assumed to have the standard conditional independence structure i.e., . Specification of the structure for H > oe 5 # M should be informed by the study design and examination of observed correlations (Simpson et al., 2013a) . Incorporating negative connections (i.e., negatively correlated nodes/brain regions) into static or longitudinal brain network analyses will also prove important. The lack of metrics for quantifying functional segregation and integration (e.g., and ) with negatively G I169,\nweighted edges remains the current limiting factor.\nOur framework is situated at the interface of statistical, network, and brain science, providing a synergistic analytic foundation for whole-brain network data. As mentioned above, this flexible approach can be modified and extended to refine its utility. It provides a step toward filling the methodological needs of the emerging area of brain network analysis and will engender deeper insights into the complex neurobiological interactions and changes that occur in many brain diseases and disorders.
