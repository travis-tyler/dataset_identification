[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "As of 22nd October 2020, more than 41 million confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and more than 1.1 million deaths have been reported worldwide1. As many countries emerge from the impact of the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, strategies to contain the virus are rooted in the rapid testing and identification (\u2018test and trace\u2019), and subsequent isolation (quarantine) of emerging cases to mitigate community transmission and future outbreaks2.\nGreat heterogeneity exists in testing policies worldwide, with some countries performing population-scale mass testing, and others opting for more selective testing approaches. Testing availability has also changed rapidly over time. Initially, testing in many countries was limited to only severe cases or those with symptoms, but that has rapidly changed as resources and testing capabilities have become more widely available3. Spain, for example, had most of the testing carried out in hospitals in the initial phase of the pandemic, but has now implemented primary care and community mass screening. However, it is likely that testing capacity will be insufficient again as second waves of COVID-19 arise in different countries. This is becoming obvious in the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (US) amongst others, where tests are sometimes unavailable and/or delayed beyond what is needed for effective test-tracing4, 5.\nAlthough aggregated figures are updated regularly and in the public domain, there is a scarcity of linked patient-level data on the clinical characteristics and outcomes of those tested and those tested positive1, 6. While many previous reports have described people tested positive or with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, only a minority focused on population-based cohorts. In addition, most of such literature consists of case reports or case series, with only a very small minority including at least 1,000 participants.\nUnderstanding the characteristics at the time of testing and health outcomes following a positive test is crucial, not only to understand disease severity and spectrum of illness, but also to provide information for forecasting COVID-19 spread and healthcare provision in the coming months. In this study, we aimed to characterize baseline socio-demographics, comorbidities and symptoms seen at the time of testing, and to assess key health outcomes amongst those tested and those tested positive."}, {"section_title": "Study Design ::: METHODS", "text": "We performed a large-scale cohort study across a network of outpatient and inpatient electronic health records (EHRs) and national claims data, all standardized to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM)7. The OMOP CDM and associated tools were used to conduct large scale federated analytics within the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) global research network, whereby each participating institution retained their patient-level data, and run analytical code made available to them by analysts for remote querying, i.e. in a distributed network fashion8. This study is part of the \u201cCharacterizing Health Associated Risks, and Your Baseline Disease In SARS-COV-2 (CHARYBDIS)\u201d study. The study protocol is available at https://github.com/ohdsi-studies/Covid19CharacterizationCharybdis/blob/master/documents/Protocol_COVID19%20Charybdis%20Characterisation_V5.docx"}, {"section_title": "Data ::: METHODS", "text": "Of twenty-one databases contributing data to OHDSI\u2019s open science community efforts to characterize the natural history of COVID-19, 12 were included in this study. Nine data sources were excluded due to absence of testing data, insufficient (<1 year) follow-up before testing or where test data were unavailable. Included data in the study were obtained from US health systems including Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC) in New York (NY), STAnford medicine Research data Repository (STARR-OMOP) in California (CA)9, Tufts CLARET (TRDW) in Massachusetts (MA), University of Colorado Anschuz Medical Campus Health Data Compass (CU-AMC HDC) in Colorado (CO) and UW Medicine COVID Research Dataset (UWM-CRD) in Washington (WA) state; US-wide hospital data from Premier, Optum\u00ae de-identified COVID-19 Electronic Health Record dataset (Optum EHR), and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA-OMOP)10; and national claims data from IQVIA Open Claims and HealthVerity. Data from South Korea (SK) came from nation-wide claims recorded in the Health Insurance Review & Assessment (HIRA) database. Spanish data came from the Information System for Research in Primary Care (SIDIAP), a primary care database from Catalonia linked to hospital admissions and regional COVID-19 tests. Data collection period varies by database from January 2020 to the end of data collection. Most data were collected from March to May 2020, whilst the data collection period for five databases span to June 2020 and beyond (CUIMC, HealthVerity, STARR-OMOP, UWM-CRD and VA-OMOP). Details on the included data sources are available in Supplementary Figure 1 and Supplementary Tables 1 and 2."}, {"section_title": "Study Participants ::: METHODS", "text": "Two cohorts were studied: 1) individuals with a first real-time PCR SARS-CoV-2 test performed between January 2020 and June 2020 (tested cohort), 2) individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 for the first time during the same timeframe (tested+ cohort). The respective index dates were the day of the first test for the tested cohort, and the test sample collection date of the first positive test for the tested+ cohort. Cohort participants were followed from index date to the earliest of death, end of the study period, or 30 days after index. The codes used to identify COVID-19 diagnoses and SARS-CoV-2 test are described in more detail in Supplementary Table 3. All study participants were required to have at least 365 days of prior observation time before index date to allow comprehensive capture of comorbidities and medication use.\nHaving a negative test for SARS-CoV-2 is a transient status and dependent on the timeframe of the study. A person tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 could test positive for SARS-CoV-2 later in time and be considered a part of the tested positive cohort if the new test was performed during the timeframe of the study. This particularly makes it difficult to study this cohort during the pandemic. As such, we did not report on the symptoms and characteristics of persons tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 test."}, {"section_title": "Baseline characteristics and outcomes of interest ::: METHODS", "text": "Demographic data including age, sex and symptoms at index date were obtained. Comorbidities from day \u221230 to day \u22121 before index date were identified based on the SNOMED CT hierarchy, with all descendant codes included. The key conditions reported here are based on recent reports of associations with COVID-19 infection or outcomes11. All conditions are reported in full at an interactive website, although this is dynamic and will change as new participants and/or databases are added over time. Detailed definitions of each condition are available at http://atlas-covid19.ohdsi.org/#/home.\nThe main study outcomes were ascertained from index to day 30 post-index and included hospitalization and death. Additional respiratory, cardiovascular (i.e. acute myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, ischemic stroke, intracranial bleed and heart failure), Venous thromboembolism events (i.e. pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis) and other secondary outcomes were also analyzed."}, {"section_title": "Statistical analyses ::: METHODS", "text": "All features and outcomes were summarized as proportions and reported per database separately. Databases were grouped into primary care EHR, hospital (inpatient and outpatient) EHR, and claims for reporting and plotting purposes to highlight the differences in the nature of the source of data.\nAll analytical code was developed centrally and run locally in each database in a federated manner, and is available at https://github.com/ohdsi-studies/Covid19CharacterizationCharybdis. The data reported here were extracted from the CHARYBDIS results set (available here in full) on 04/10/2020.\nAll the data partners obtained Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval or exemption, as appropriate, to conduct this study. Co-authors with access to the relevant documentation and with direct access to each of the contributing data sources are mentioned in Supplementary Table 1."}, {"section_title": "Baseline demographics, comorbidities, and symptoms: ::: RESULTS", "text": "The majority of study participants were aged 18\u201364 years old, with small representation of children and a variable proportion of elderly (>65) ranging from 20% to 48% of the total tested. Women were overrepresented amongst the tested (52% in HIRA to 64% in SIDIAP) in all data sources except VA-OMOP, which is a predominantly male cohort. Detailed patient characteristics including socio-demographics, pre-existing comorbidity and prior drug use are reported in Table 1.\nKey comorbidities were generally more prevalent in the tested+ compared to the overall tested (Figure 1, and age- and sex-stratified in Supplementary Figures 2). These differences were consistent across databases for hypertension (59.9% in the tested+ vs 20.1% in the tested in VA-OMOP), obesity (44.4% vs 31.2% in VA_OMOP) and heart disease (42.4% vs 18.8% in VA-OMOP).\nThe prevalence of symptoms at index date in those tested and tested+ is depicted in Figure 2 (stratified by age and sex in Supplementary Figures 3). The most commonly reported symptoms amongst the tested were cough (2.6% in UWM-CRD to 27.5% in IQVIA-OpenClaims), fever (from 1.1% in SIDIAP to 18.6% in HIRA), and dyspnoea (1.3% in SIDIAP to 15.1% in TRDW). The prevalence of these symptoms was higher in those tested+ and in hospital EHR compared to claims or primary care databases."}, {"section_title": "30-day outcomes amongst the tested+: ::: RESULTS", "text": "The percentage of patients hospitalized within 30 days after testing positive was: 4.2% (HealthVerity), 9.6% (STARR-OMOP), 19.5% (UWM-CRD), 19.8% (Optum-EHR), 22.9% (TRDW), 25.5% (VA-OMOP), 27.1% (SIDIAP), and 37.6% (CUIMC). Overall fatality in the month after the first positive test ranged from 9.2% (CUIMC) to 10.5% (SIDIAP) (Figure 3). There was a general downward trend over time in outcomes. For example, from March to May, hospitalization decreased from 45% to 14.3% and 30-day mortality decreased from 11% to 1.2% in CUIMC.\nRegarding other complications, the percentage of tested+ patients diagnosed with pneumonia within 30 days from the test date ranged from 3.6% (HealthVerity) to 22.4% (VA-OMOP); acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) from 1.1% (HealthVerity) to 12.0% (VA-OMOP); sepsis 0.6% (HealthVerity) to 4.9% (VA-OMOP). Acute kidney injury was the most common renal outcome (0.6% in HealthVerity to 7.9% in VA-OMOP), followed by dialysis (0.2% in HealthVerity to 1.5% in both TRDW and VA-OMOP). The composite of total cardiovascular events occurred in 0.2% (SIDIAP) to 5.0% (VA-OMOP), whilst venous thromboembolic events were recorded in 0.2% (HealthVerity) to 2.3% (VA-OMOP) (Supplementary Figure 4)."}, {"section_title": "Strengths and limitations ::: DISCUSSION", "text": "Our study has limitations. We analysed data collected during routine care and in actual practice settings for clinical rather than research purposes. It is therefore expected that some information will be incompletely reported, leading to potential misclassification. The variability observed in testing practices and the similarity in the distribution of important comorbidities, symptoms and demographics in the tested vs tested+ cohorts suggests targeted testing for subjects with severe forms of disease in the first months of the pandemic. The lack of mild infections limits our ability to identify key variables associated with susceptibility to infection. Underreporting of symptoms in EHR is another limitation of the study which can be due to factors such as source of data, testing availability, model of care, and reimbursement policies. We observed wide-spread variation in symptom reporting and a generally lower prevalence of symptoms compared to previous literature. Despite this, our study suggests that symptoms such as cough and fever remain key disease features, predictive of a positive test. We were not able to describe characteristics of the population tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 given the transient state of this population and specifically the difficulties in accurately ascertaining this cohort during a pandemic. However, the majority of the tested population consists of persons who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 with tested+ cohort comprising at most 6.7% of the tested cohort. As such, the observed difference in characteristics and outcomes between the tested and tested+ cohorts are largely explained by the tested negative population.\nThis study also has strengths. First, this is the largest patient-level cohort of COVID-19 tested and tested+ patients to date. This allowed us to study the observed risks of relatively uncommon outcomes, otherwise not identifiable in smaller datasets. Secondly, we obtained data from multiple centres, three countries, three continents, and covering almost 6 months of 2020, allowing for a comprehensive characterisation of the study population, their key baseline characteristics, symptoms and 30-day outcomes. Finally, the use of routinely collected data from multiple sources maximized the external validity and generalizability of our findings to our settings internationally, whilst minimising Hawthorne effects and selection bias."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions ::: DISCUSSION", "text": "In the largest cohort study to date, adult women were the majority of the almost 3.32 million people tested, and of the >219,000 tested positive study participants. Fever, cough and dyspnoea were the most common symptoms, more frequently reported in patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The observed heterogeneity in testing practices complicated an accurate measurement of health outcomes related to COVID-19 in the first half of 2020. With increasing testing capacity, as recommended by the WHO30, the test+/tested ratio declined in May and June compared to March/April. Ensuring sufficient testing capacity will remain a challenge during the current second wave. If achieved, keeping a low (e.g. <5%) test+/tested ratio will help control and understand the COVID-19 pandemic in the coming months."}]
