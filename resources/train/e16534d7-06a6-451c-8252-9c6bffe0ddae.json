[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "The World Health Organization declared a pandemic of coronavirus disease SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) on 11 March 2020. 1 Rapid spread of COVID-19 heavily affected healthcare systems worldwide, which led to vast and widespread changes in hospitals' structure to plan for increased intensive care unit (ICU) capacity to cope with the pandemic. 2 As a result, this pandemic not only affected COVID-19 patients, but also impacted the entire healthcare system including the provision of care for patients with cancer and surgery. 3, 4 Recent reports suggest an increased risk for cancer patients to develop severe complications when infected by COVID-19, with a similar pattern observed for those treated with surgery or chemotherapy. 5 Pursuing oncological care exposes both healthcare professionals and patients to become infected by COVID-19. However, the inability to receive oncological and/or surgical care seems to be an equally important prognostic threat for cancer patients. 6 The aggressive disease biology of esophageal and gastric cancer requires the continuation of oncological therapy during the COVID-19 pandemic. 7 However, thoughtful strategies need to be developed to support healthcare professionals in clinical decision-making and ensure resources are allocated appropriately. 8 This international survey aimed to clarify the changes observed in esophageal and gastric cancer management during the COVID-19 pandemic. This was performed by surveying international specialist surgeons with a focus on how the pandemic has affected their cancer services and how they have adapted their service with respect to: (1) cancer staging pathways, (2) multidisciplinary team (MDT)/tumor board meetings, (3) oncological therapy, (4) operative intervention, (5) preoperative COVID-19 testing and (6) effect of the pandemic on esophagogastric cancer surgeons and redeployment."}, {"section_title": "Survey", "text": "An online survey was developed through a consensus process involving a core group of investigators (Appendix I). The questionnaire was designed to cover a range of key areas for esophageal and gastric cancer, including staging investigations and oncological and surgical therapy before and during (at two separate time-points) the COVID-19 pandemic. This survey was circulated to all members of the international esophageal and gastric associations and study groups: Australian and New Zealand Gastric and Oesophageal Surgery Association, Association of Upper Gastrointestinal Surgeons (AUGIS), Dutch Cancer Audit, European Society of Diseases of Esophagus (ESDE), Gastric Cancer Surgery Trials Reported Outcomes Standardisation (GASTROS), International Society for Disease of Esophagus and Oesophagogastric Anastomosis Audit using Google Forms (Google LLC, Menlo Park, CA, USA). Only consultant or attending surgeons performing esophageal and gastric resections were invited to complete the online survey via email.\nThe survey consisted of two rounds with 40 questions (Appendix II and III) on baseline characteristics, the local impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on esophageal and gastric surgery (i.e. MDT meeting, availability of staging investigations, choice of oncological therapy, surgical resection and ICU capacity) and statements about prioritization of resection in the current era of the COVID-19 pandemic to gain a consensus. Each statement had to be appraised using the 'prioritization of patients for cancer surgery' 9 from the National Health Service England options: priority level 1 (curative therapy with a high [>50%] chance of success), priority level 2 (curative therapy with an intermediate [15-50%] chance of success), priority level 3 (noncurative therapy with a high [>50%] chance of >1 year of life extension), priority level 4 (curative therapy with a low [0-15%] chance of success or noncurative therapy with an intermediate [15-50%] chance of >1 year life extension), priority level 5 (noncurative therapy with a high [>50%] chance of palliation/temporary tumor control, but <1 year life extension) and priority level 6 (noncurative therapy with an intermediate [15-50%] chance of palliation or temporary tumor control and <1 year life extension).\nThe first round of the survey was conducted in the last week of March 2020 (Fig. 1A ) and the second round was repeated in the last 2 weeks of April 2020 (Fig. 1B) . Nonrespondents were sent two reminder emails. Respondents were asked to register their name and institution to prevent overlap of members between the same hospitals."}, {"section_title": "Definitions", "text": "Critical care capacity was defined using the CRIT-CON level, which was originally developed in 2009 by the North West London Critical Care Network in response to the H1N1 influenza pandemic. 10 This grades ICU capacity into the following levels (CRITCON 0-4, corresponding to 'business as usual', 'normal winter', 'unprecedented', 'last resort' and 'triage'). Data for total confirmed cases per capita were derived from the 'Our World in Data', 11 which is a platform for global data on a broad range of conditions.

Most respondents were upper gastrointestinal or esophagogastric surgeons (n = 158, 67.5%) working in an academic center (n = 217, 92.7%). The majority of centers had 501-1,000 hospital beds (n = 91, 38.9%) and 36.8% (n = 86) of centers had 20 to 50 hospital ICU beds.

Limited variations were observed in stratified analyses by total COVID-19 cases between rounds (Supplementary data, Table S3 )."}, {"section_title": "Oncological therapy", "text": "Esophageal adenocarcinoma Standard pre-COVID-19 oncological therapies available for potentially curative esophageal adenocarcinoma included neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCS) (n = 163, 69.1%) or chemoradiotherapy (NCRS) (n = 152, 64.4%) (Fig. 3A) . Definitive chemoradiotherapy (DCRT) was offered in 14.8% of centers and significantly increased during the COVID-19 pandemic by almost three-fold in both round 1 and 2 (39.7% and 38.0%, P < 0.001).\nStratified analyses demonstrated higher rates of adoption of DCRT in H-CoV centers in both round 1 and 2 compared to standard for esophageal adenocarcinoma (Supplementary data, Fig. S2 , Table S4 ).\nEsophageal squamous cell carcinoma Standard pre-COVID-19 oncological therapies available for potentially curative esophageal squamous cell carcinoma included NCRS (n = 188, 80.3%) and DCRT (n = 110, 47.0%) (Fig. 3B) . DCRT was offered in 47.0% of centers and significantly increased during the COVID-19 pandemic in both round 1 and 2 (64.5% and 73.9%, P < 0.001). Stratified analyses demonstrated significantly higher rates of adoption of DCRT and H-CoV centers in both round 1 and 2 compared to standard for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (Supplementary data, Fig. S2 , Table S4 ).\nTiming of surgery after neoadjuvant therapy For timing of surgery after neoadjuvant therapy as standard pre-COVID practice, the majority of centers offered surgery 6 to 8 weeks following neoadjuvant therapy (n = 132, 56.4%) and only 4.3% and 0.9% of centers offered surgery after 10 to 12 weeks and >12 weeks, respectively. However, there was a fivefold significant increase in centers offering surgery 10 to 12 weeks after neoadjuvant therapy in round 1 and 2 (26.5% vs. 21.7%, P < 0.001) ( Table 2 ).\nChanges to overall treatment Overall changes to curative treatment for esophagogastric cancers are displayed in Figure 3C . While planned or proceeding to surgery (Supplementary data, Fig. S3 ).\nThis survey has demonstrated broad shifts in oncological management of patients with both esophageal adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma toward use of DCRT. This likely reflects the uncertainty related to surgical capacity owing to the lack of HDU or ICU capacity. In the absence of robust randomized trial data, DCRT and neoadjuvant treatment followed by surgery have equivalent survival outcomes for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. 12, 13 The evidence base for DCRT is less strong for esophageal adenocarcinoma, 13 but reasonable outcomes were seen for this group in the SCOPE1 trial. 14, 15 In this survey, there are also broad shifts to delaying time to surgery following neoadjuvant therapy, which could potentially affect prognosis. A meta-analysis of 13 studies involving 15,086 patients showed an interval longer than 7 to 8 weeks between the end of neoadjuvant CRT and surgery was significantly associated with an improved pathological complete response rate, but lower 2-year and 5-year overall survival. 16 The effect of delay after NCS is less certain, however, a recent US National Cancer Database study demonstrated that an additional delay to surgery by at least 4 weeks may not have a significant impact on patient survival or cancer progression. 17 In addition, data presented for esophageal and gastric cancers suggest that surgery could be potentially safe to postpone up to 28 and 30 weeks after diagnosis in patients receiving neoadjuvant treatment. 17 The ongoing NeoRes-II randomized controlled trial evaluating timing of surgery after NCRS will provide level 1 evidence. 18"}, {"section_title": "Perioperative cancer surgery", "text": "Surgical prioritization Prioritization of cancer resections was based on a national protocol in 19.7% of centers in round 1 and 23.9% in round 2 (Table 1 ).

We also assessed factors used in prioritization of cancer resections. In round 1, patient fitness was ranked first by 35.0% of respondents and tumor stage was ranked first by 34.4% of respondents. There were no significant differences in proportion of respondents ranking both patient fitness and tumor stage first in round 2 (Fig. 4A) . However, there was a significant increase in proportion of respondents ranking neoadjuvant timing as first from round 1 to round 2 (16.7% vs. 27.7%, P = 0.011).\nTo assess variation in prioritization of esophagogastric cancer resections, respondents were asked to prioritize case vignettes (Fig. 4B) . Overall, there were no significant differences in ranking between cases in round 1 and 2. Prioritization of resections was based on early stage cancers or good physical fitness.

"}, {"section_title": "Cancer resection prioritization", "text": "There is a concern that limited HDU/ICU bed availability and the risk of postoperative SARS-CoV-2 infection will severely limit or preclude surgical intervention for esophagogastric patients. Therefore, prioritization of cancer resection patients most likely to benefit and be at low risk of complications is important. Several groups have developed guidelines and prioritization models, including AUGIS, 19 ESDE, 20 Thoracic Surgery Outcomes Research Network 21 and other groups [22] [23] [24] specifically for this patient group. The medically necessary, timesensitive (MeNTS) score has been developed and systematically scores several factors (procedure timing and resource use, disease urgency and patient risk factors) for prioritizing surgical procedures across all surgical specialties. 24 This scoring system aims to triage MeNTS procedures, and appropriately weighs individual patient risks with the ethical necessity of optimizing resource allocation during the pandemic. This approach is applicable across a broad range of hospital settings (academic and community, urban and rural) and may be able to inform case triage as operating room capacity resumes once the acute phase of the pandemic subsides. This survey highlights the prioritization of cancer resections by centers is based on patient fitness and tumor stage. In our survey, surgeons appear to prioritize advanced tumors (i.e. high-risk nodal disease) due to high risk of disease progression. 17 Treatment decisions are further complicated by the fact most of the patients with esophagogastric cancer are in a 'highrisk' category for poor outcomes if they developed COVID-19 (elderly, cardiorespiratory comorbidities and obesity). In addition, the surgery (especially thoracotomy) can both impair lung function (i.e. one lung isolation, postoperative pain and pneumonia) and potentially expose clinical teams to aerosolized viral load (bronchoscopy, double-lumen endotracheal tube placement and endoscopy). 21"}, {"section_title": "Screening and protection in COVID-19", "text": "Due to the high prevalence of pulmonary complications following esophagogastric surgery, 25 and the implications of postoperative COVID-19 infection, rates of asymptomatic infection, there is a convincing case for accurate preoperative testing of these patients prior to surgery.

In addition, a wide range of countries and continents, with differing COVID-19 disease incidence were captured. This allowed stratified analyses to be performed for total cases per capita to gain extra insight into the uncertainty in current practice among esophageal surgeons. By its nature, this survey will have limitations. First, despite widely advertising this survey via multiple specialist organizations and social media, it is possible that selection bias has occurred. Our survey was specifically designed for surgeons and as such the thoughts of patients, oncologists or other healthcare professionals involved in the treatment of esophagogastric surgery have not been elicited. Second, this study did not collect specific patient outcomes for esophageal and gastric cancers surgery and COVID-19. However, research from collaborative groups such as CovidSurg 33 and PanSurg 34 collaborative will provide real-time data to further supplement data from this survey.
