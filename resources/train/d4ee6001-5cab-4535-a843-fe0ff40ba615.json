[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Background Elevated CSF \u03c4 is considered a biomarker of neuronal injury in newly developed Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) criteria. However, previous studies have failed to detect alterations of \u03c4 species in other primary tauopathies. We assessed CSF \u03c4 protein abnormalities in AD, a tauopathy with prominent A\u03b2 pathology, and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), a primary tauopathy characterised by deposition of four microtubule-binding repeat (4R) \u03c4 with minimal A\u03b2 pathology. Methods 26 normal control (NC), 37 AD, and 24 patients with PSP participated in the study. AD and PSP were matched for severity using the clinical dementia rating sum of boxes (CDR-sb) scores. The INNO BIA AlzBio3 multiplex immunoassay was used to measure CSF A\u03b2, total \u03c4, and ptau181. Additional, novel ELISAs targeting different N-terminal and central \u03c4 epitopes were developed to examine CSF \u03c4 components and to investigate interactions between diagnostic group, demographics and genetic variables. Results PSP had lower CSF N-terminal and C-terminal \u03c4 concentrations than NC and AD measured with the novel \u03c4 ELISAs and the standard AlzBio3 \u03c4 and ptau assays. AD had higher total \u03c4 and ptau levels than NC and PSP. There was a gender by diagnosis interaction in AD and PSP for most \u03c4 species, with lower concentrations for male compared to female patients. Conclusions CSF \u03c4 fragment concentrations are different in PSP compared with AD despite the presence of severe \u03c4 pathology and neuronal injury in both disorders. CSF \u03c4 concentration likely reflects multiple factors in addition to the degree of neuronal injury."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) are two common neurodegenerative tauopathies. In both, the severity and neuroanatomic distribution of \u03c4 pathology at autopsy is correlated with disease phenomenology prior to death. [1] [2] [3] AD displays an equal ratio of three to four microtubule-binding repeats (3R=4R) and is also characterised by the accumulation of amyloid plaques in addition to \u03c4. By contrast, PSP is a relatively 'pure' tauopathy and is characterised by deposition of 4R \u03c4. The prevailing hypothesis is that amyloid accumulates prior to alterations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of \u03c4, which increase in parallel with neuronal damage in AD. 4 Elevated concentrations of \u03c4 can be measured in AD CSF using assays that quantify central \u03c4 epitopes. Because PSP is a pure tauopathy, using tau as a biomarker may have better potential to demonstrate efficacy of \u03c4-directed therapies than studies of more pathologically heterogeneous disorders such as AD.\nPSP is less common than AD, but is genetically and biochemically more strongly linked to \u03c4. 3 5 However, CSF \u03c4 concentrations in PSP are comparable to, or lower than, age-matched controls. [6] [7] [8] [9] Similar results have been reported for human \u03c4 mutation carriers, 10 and transgenic mice that express such mutations display decreasing \u03c4 concentrations in the brain interstitial fluid in parallel with deposition of insoluble \u03c4 and onset of neuronal dysfunction. 11 Decreases in CSF \u03c4 in PSP and other primary tauopathies might reflect a different propensity of 4R \u03c4 to aggregate, be released from cells, 12 or undergo proteolytic cleavage 13 as compared to equal mixtures of 3R and 4R \u03c4 found in AD.\n14 Alternatively, standard CSF \u03c4 assays might not detect elevations of \u03c4 species that are elevated in primary tauopathies. To examine this possibility, we used novel ELISAs targeting N-terminal and middomain epitopes 15 to compare CSF \u03c4 concentrations in severity-matched patients with AD and PSP."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study population", "text": "Twenty-four patients with PSP, 37 patients with AD, and 26 normal controls (NC) were evaluated at the University of California, San Francisco Memory and Aging Center.

As shown in figure 2, lower CSF \u03c4 levels were identified in PSP as compared to NC with the novel \u03c4 ELISAs in several N-terminal and mid-domain epitopes: Tau12-BT2 ( p=0.018), BT2-HT7 ( p=0.019), HT7-PT181 ( p=0.05) and the AlzBio3 assays for total \u03c4 ( p=0.034) and ptau ( p=0.028). Lower A\u03b2 levels were seen in PSP ( p=0.002) than NC.

This group demonstrated lower A\u03b2 levels than PSP ( p<0.0014) and NC ( p<0.0001). Patients with PSP had lower A\u03b2 levels than NC ( p<0.0014). Differences in \u03c4 levels were also analysed. The results with this AD group were similar to the original AD cohort (table 2) .\nThere was an interaction between gender and CSF \u03c4 concentration in the AD1 and PSP groups, but not AD2 or NC (figure 2). Male patients with PSP had lower CSF \u03c4 levels than female patients in the N-terminal fragments Tau12-BT2 (p=0.003) and Tau12-HT7 (p=0.013), and in the mid-domain fragments BT2-HT7 (p=0.028) and HT7-Tau5 (p=0.008) ELISAs.

None of the other demographic or genetic variables influenced CSF analyte concentrations.\nROC analyses were used to determine the ability of CSF \u03c4 concentration to differentiate PSP from NC and AD (table 3) . Multiple CSF \u03c4 assays were able to differentiate PSP from AD (area under the curve (AUC) range between 0.794 and 0.948) with the N-terminal fragment \u03c412-BT2 assay (AUC=0.948, p<0.001) having the highest AUC value. Most CSF \u03c4 assays also differentiated PSP from NC, however AUC values were lower (AUC range between 0.654 and 0.730), p<0.02."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "We identified divergent patterns of CSF \u03c4 abnormalities in two common tauopathies, AD and PSP, using the standard AlzBio3 CSF \u03c4 assays used in most AD research, and a series of novel ELISAs designed to detect other CSF \u03c4 fragments. 15 In patients with AD and PSP matched for disease severity, patients with AD displayed higher CSF \u03c4 and ptau levels than NC, whereas patients with PSP had lower levels than NC. In patients with PSP and one of the AD cohorts, there was an interaction with gender, such that males had lower CSF \u03c4 levels than females in most assays. There were no effects of other demographic factors or the disease-associated genotypes ApoE4 and \u03c4 H1 haplotype. Although the current literature, which is mainly based on studies of AD, suggests that elevated CSF \u03c4 concentrations reflect neuronal injury and cell death in neurodegenerative disease, 4 28 our data demonstrate that this model does not hold true for the primary four repeat tauopathy, PSP. Further investigations into the mechanisms of CSF \u03c4 alterations may reveal differences in the pathophysiology of \u03c4-related neurodegeneration in AD and PSP. 11 29 The standard AlzBio3 \u03c4 assays may detect only a subset of potential CSF \u03c4 fragments. 15 30 31 Therefore, we used novel CSF \u03c4 ELISAs designed to measure \u03c4 fragments containing N-terminal and mid-domain sequences. The absolute concentrations of \u03c4 fragments measured in the novel ELISAs were higher than those measured with AlzBio3. This likely resulted from technical differences in the assays due to differences in antibodies, matrix effects or standards. Without a more quantitative measurement of \u03c4 fragment levels, such as mass spectrometry, it is impossible to directly compare these values. Nonetheless, using these assays, we found lower \u03c4 fragment levels in patients with PSP compared to controls and AD.\nUnexpectedly, in the first AD cohort (AD1), CSF A\u03b242 levels in patients with AD and PSP were comparable, and lower than NC as in one previous study, 8 but different from other reports in PSP that found higher A\u03b242 levels. 7 8 32 33 One possible explanation for low CSF A\u03b242 in some patients with PSP would be the presence of concurrent AD pathology. 34 To further explore the potential confounding effects of concurrent AD pathology we compared PSP cases with low A\u03b242 (below the mean) with those with higher A\u03b242 (mean or higher) and found that patients with PSP with low CSF A\u03b242 had even lower total \u03c4 levels and \u03c4 fragment levels than patients with PSP with high CSF A\u03b242 levels ( p<0.034). This suggests that even in combined PSP and AD, CSF \u03c4 levels are lower than NCs, however, further analyses in autopsy-confirmed cases will be necessary to confirm this hypothesis.\nWe also found lower CSF total \u03c4 and ptau levels using the standard AlzBio3 assays in PSP compared to AD and controls. Although several previous studies have found PSP CSF total \u03c4 concentrations comparable to controls, 7 8 32 the lack of observed differences in those studies may have been confounded by \u03c4 levels being near the limit of detection; a more recent study 6 demonstrated lower ptau in PSP compared to controls, similar to our results.\nThere was an effect of gender on CSF \u03c4 levels measured in many of the \u03c4 assays in AD1 and PSP, but not in NC. AD1 and male patients with PSP had lower CSF \u03c4 than their female counterparts ( figure 2 ). This suggests that our ability to detect CSF \u03c4 concentration differences between PSP and NC could also reflect differences in the gender composition of both groups as compared to previous studies. A previous study demonstrated that normal elder female ApoE4 carriers have increased CSF \u03c4 levels relative to non-carriers, similar to our results in AD. 35 Another study found patients with AD who are \u03c4 H1/H1 haplotype carriers have lower CSF \u03c4 levels as compared to H1/H2 carriers. 36 We did not observe either effect, but differences in sample size, age and gender distribution may have influenced our findings since the gender effect was not present in the AD2 group. A limitation of this study is the difficulty in matching patients with AD and PSP for disease severity given their disparate clinical presentations. We matched patient groups using the CDR-sb which is commonly used to match AD with non-AD neurodegenerative syndromes. 33 37 While it is possible the relative disease severity differed between patient groups, the different directions of CSF \u03c4 alteration relative to NC argue that such differences would not influence our results, and there were no correlations between disease severity and CSF \u03c4 levels in either patient group. A second potential limitation of this work is that we relied on clinical and not neuropathological diagnoses that could quantify the exact degree of underlying \u03c4 pathology. Given the disparate clinical presentations and excellent clinicpathological diagnostic accuracy of the PSP criteria we used, 16 it is unlikely that misdiagnosis confounded these results; however, it is possible that our results might be influenced by the presence of concurrent AD pathology, which sometimes occurs in PSP. 34 A third potential limitation of this study is that the novel ELISAs could not distinguish between 3R and 4R \u03c4 isoforms. A previous study 38 found lower 4R \u03c4 in CSF from patients with AD and PSP, suggesting that the difference we observed could potentially be explained by a selective alteration in 3R \u03c4 levels. Future studies will examine this possibility.\nOur findings suggest that the relationship between CSF \u03c4 and neurodegenerative disease is a complex process potentially reflecting multiple factors related to the underlying cause of the tauopathy. Therefore, viewing \u03c4 only as an indicator of neuronal damage may not be accurate in generating models of \u03c4-related pathogenesis. Possible explanations for the different effects of disease on CSF \u03c4 concentrations measured using ELISA-based techniques in different tauopathies include (1) Altered CSF \u03c4 fragment conformations may lead to differential affinity for the same monoclonal antibody. (2) Differences in CSF \u03c4 fragments produced in each disease may lead to different observed patterns in CSF. 13 39 We found the greatest differences between PSP and NC using the N-terminal fragment ELISAs Tau12, BT2 and HT7; selective alterations in N-terminal \u03c4 fragments in PSP 13 40 Figure 2 Diagnostic group differences in CSF analytes stratified by gender CSF concentrations of \u03b2-amyloid peptide1-42 (A\u03b242) (A), Alzbio3 total tau (Tau) (B), AlzBio3 phosphorylated tau (PTau) (C), Tau12-BT2 tau fragment (D), BT2-HT7 \u03c4 fragment (E), HT7-PTau181 tau fragment (F), HT7-Tau5 \u03c4 fragment (G), and Tau12-HT7 \u03c4 fragment (H), in normal controls (NC) and patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP); All = total number of subjects in the group; M, male subjects; F, female subjects. *p <0.05. **p <0.01. ***p <0.001. A variety of new \u03c4-directed therapies are entering human clinical trials for AD and other tauopathies. 14 39 These drugs were developed in transgenic mouse models that overexpress mutant forms of 4R \u03c4, which produces human clinical disease similar to frontotemporal degeneration or PSP, but not AD. The different associations between disease and CSF \u03c4 concentration observed in this study suggest that alterations in CSF \u03c4 in clinical trials of \u03c4-directed therapies may require different interpretations in AD and PSP, and that results in PSP may be more analogous to treatment effects observed in preclinical models.\nContributors All authors have made substantial contributions to conception and design, acquisition of data or analysis and interpretation of data; drafting of the article or revising it critically for important intellectual content, and provided final approval of the version to be published.
