[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "In the current paper, we employ the most recent Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) data to calculate a less-biased estimate of poverty on U.S. achievement. The PISA was specifically chosen as it is an assessment removed from a specific curriculum and instead focuses on concepts that students should know in order to participate in a global economy. Using a propensity score matching approach, our findings suggest that U.S. students in poverty have notable educational attainment deficiencies compared to a matched group of students who are not in poverty. In other words, when we select two students who have a great deal in common but for the fact that one comes from a poverty background, the student in poverty is expected to perform nearly 28 points, or about a quarter of a standard deviation lower, on the PISA assessment. In real terms, this puts math achievement for children not in poverty on-par with the OECD average, while children in poverty are well below the OECD average. can be found in a recent United Nations Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) report on the effects of the global recession and child poverty rates around the world. Using fixed reference points for wealth (rather than some percentage of the median income) to assess the absolute change in child poverty from 2008 to 2012, the authors show higher poverty rates in many affluent countries than normally reported by those countries. In the U.S., the number is staggering, with an estimated 32% of children living in poverty. And for families with children that fall below 50% of the poverty threshold (defined as extreme poverty), the data is even more troubling. The UNICEF Office of Research (2014, 3) states that extreme child poverty in the U.S. increased more during the last recession \"than it did in the recession of 1982, suggesting that, for the very poorest, the safety net affords less protection now than it did three decades ago\". In fact, among the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) countries, the U.S. has the 6 th highest rate of child poverty-ranking between Bulgaria and Chile (OECD 2014a).\nHistorically, in the U.S. education has been regarded as one of the most important tools for alleviating poverty at both the individual and societal level (Labaree 1997 ). Yet, as wealth gaps continue to widen in the U.S., more children face the stark reality of living in poverty. As such, more than ever, there is an increased importance in understanding the effects of material deprivation on educational achievement. In the current paper we attempt to answer this question by using the most recent Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) data to establish less-biased estimates of poverty on achievement.\nThe PISA was specifically chosen as it is an international assessment that is not dependent on a particular curriculum but instead measures knowledge and skills that students toward the end of compulsory education should know and can do in order to fully participate in a modern, global economy (OECD 2013). A unique feature of the PISA is that students are asked to not only reproduce what they have learned but to apply their knowledge and skills in unfamiliar settings, within and beyond the school. Understanding the association of poverty on this particular skilland knowledge-set offers unique insights into the ways students from disadvantaged backgrounds are equipped to take the next step in their education or the world of work.\nDespite the rich literature examining the relationship between socioeconomic status (SES) and student achievement, there remain a number of limitations in the existing body of research. As we discuss below, poverty estimates often rely on flawed measures (frequently relying on definitions of SES that are too narrow), neglect school-based inequalities associated with SES, (2009) showed that in Canada, the gap between lower SES and higher SES students grew over time.\nStudies indicate that poverty has both a direct effect on students, for example through cognitive As a proxy for poverty status, U.S.-based studies frequently rely on eligibility for Free and Reduced Lunches (FRL), eligibility for which is set at 185% of the federally defined poverty line. However, the FRL measure has been criticized on a number of grounds, including: a high risk of misclassification, exclusive reliance on income over other forms of SES, large withincategory differences, changes in eligibility guidelines, and the fact that FRL wasn't designed to be used as a measure for low SES ( Particularly problematic when analyzing student poverty and achievement, a plurality of students now has FRL status according to the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP).\nHowever, as FRL is often the best available measure, the indicator continues to be used as a We present a summary of the aforementioned research estimating SES achievement gaps in mathematics in the U.S. in Table 1 . Whichever measure or population is considered, the basic pattern is the same: lower-SES students do substantially worse than their more advantaged peers.\nNotably, the gaps range from .8 to 1.3 standard deviations, despite very different thresholds (top and bottom quartiles, quintiles, deciles, etc.).\nThese studies all have their limitations, however. For example, except for NAEP, each estimate compares students in the most advantaged categories to those in the least advantaged, rather than comparing the performance of the least advantaged students to the rest of the student population. Only Schmidt et al. (2015) and Garcia (2015) use multidimensional indices of SES, which more accurately capture the complex construct. In many respects, Garcia's study most closely resembles our own approach, but it is explicitly focused on background estimates of SES upon students and is restricted to kindergarteners. It excludes school-based estimates that develop during the course of a student's school attendance. As a consequence, it fails to account for aggregate estimates of poverty on student outcomes, for example through tracking or differences in teacher quality. (2003) provided an overview of empirical research into the racial and ethnic stratification in educational achievement, reviewing test scores, grades, educational aspirations, educational attainment, high school completion, and college completion. In their review, the authors found that African Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans consistently perform lower on tests and achieve lower course grades when compared to their White and Asian peers in the U.S. In addition, the former groups have lower educational attainment and lower high school and college completion rates. In a study of NAEP trends over the past 30 years, Lee (2002) noted that the achievement gaps remain large and are a cause for concern among education policy makers.\nAlthough race and SES are correlated, looking beyond SES, society and school environments are viable explanations of race-attributed differences, making it erroneous to conflate race and poverty. Census data indicates that Black (38%) and Hispanic (32%) students are more likely to be in poverty than White students (12%), but according to NAEP, White students account for nearly a third of all free and reduced lunch-eligible students in 8 th grade.\nTaken individually, achievement gaps by FRL and race are about one standard deviation in 8 th grade math, but the conditional estimate of SES on NAEP scores is quite different: a .7 standard deviation difference between FRL eligible and non-eligible Whites compared with a .5 deviation difference for Black and Hispanic students. Similarly, controlling for race, Garcia's (2015) high/low achievement gap is estimated at .84 standard deviations. Given these differences in conditional SES estimates, there appears to be some portion of achievement variance that is not common between these two variables, making race an important confounder to include in a model that focuses on SES-related achievement gaps.\nThere are a number of other important correlates of poverty available in the PISA data that can be used to develop a less-biased estimate of poverty gaps. Although race and immigration status are sometimes associated, immigration status has been separated as an area of interest and concern when it comes to educational achievement both in the U.S. and around the world (OECD, 2012b) . In a recent study of immigrants from Asia, the Caribbean, and Latin America, Su\u00e1rez-Orozco, Bang, and Onaga (2010, 6; see also Woessmann 2004) found that immigrant students face \"transplant shock\", or culture shock, when placed into an education system that may be vastly different from their home country's system, resulting in lower achievement.\nEarly childhood education is one cited contributing factor to better initial educational achievement among less economically advantaged students ( Unfortunately, issues around truancy and tardiness have often been found to be associated with poverty (Marvul).\nEducation aspiration has also been linked to academic achievement, especially among poor students (Kao and Thompson 2003; Kao and Tienda 1998; Mau, 1995) . In particular, Kao and Tienda showed that over time the educational aspirations of low-income students fall as those students reach the end of compulsory education. The same authors also noted evidence Rutkowski et al. 10 10 supporting an association between educational aspiration and attainment in their review of racial stratification and achievement.\nIn sum, we believe that the magnitude of the educational effects of student poverty remains an open question. Although there are many studies that are focused on poverty, use rich measures, or account for important covariates like race and immigrant status, to our knowledge no other study includes all of these features.\nIn order for us to calculate an estimate of poverty on educational achievement, we use a propensity score matching (PSM) approach to estimate poverty-based achievement gaps. The basic theory behind PSM is to approximate the counterfactual by identifying a control group (not in poverty) that is as similar as possible to the treatment group (in poverty) through a matching procedure. PSM addresses the likely situation that poverty is not randomly assigned, but rather that demographics and other factors explain \"selection\" into poverty. Importantly, to get a lessbiased estimate of the treatment effect, the most important predictors of poverty should be included in the matching procedure to account for observed differences (and, to a limited extent, unobserved differences) among students in and out of poverty. Given the constraints of the U.S.\nPISA background questionnaire, we control for differences on observed and latent characteristics measured by the questionnaire, namely race/ethnicity, preschool attendance, truancy/tardiness, educational aspirations, household structure (e.g. two-or single-parent households, parental occupational status), and immigration background.

As we discuss below, poverty estimates often rely on flawed measures (frequently relying on definitions of SES that are too narrow), neglect school-based inequalities associated with SES, and fail to account for important confounders like race, immigration status, pre-K education, and educational aspirations. To our knowledge, no other study estimates the effect of poverty on U.S.\nupper secondary students using a multidimensional indicator of SES and accounts for key covariates such as race.\nFor several decades, education researchers have recognized an association between child poverty and low student achievement (Campbell and Ramey 1994; Dahl and Lochner 2012; Entwisle and Alexander 1992; Kao and Thompson 2003; van der Klaauw 2008) . Children of low SES begin school less prepared than their higher SES peers (Burchinal et al. 2008; Heckman 2005) , with income playing an integral factor (Dahl and Lochner) . Low SES students also maintain their low achievement (Sirin 2005) . In fact, Caro, McDonald, and Willms (2009) showed that in Canada, the gap between lower SES and higher SES students grew over time.\nStudies indicate that poverty has both a direct effect on students, for example through cognitive deficits (Nelson and Sheridan 2011) , as well as a direct effect through weaker instruction (Schmidt et al. 2015) and lower teacher quality (Goldhaber et al. 2015) , among other factors (e.g. school resources, class size, etc.). International research suggests that SES achievement gaps are not just a U.S. phenomenon but pervade worldwide (Chudgar and Luschei 2009; Schmidt et al. 2015) .\nAs a proxy for poverty status, U.S.-based studies frequently rely on eligibility for Free and Reduced Lunches (FRL), eligibility for which is set at 185% of the federally defined poverty line. However, the FRL measure has been criticized on a number of grounds, including: a high risk of misclassification, exclusive reliance on income over other forms of SES, large withincategory differences, changes in eligibility guidelines, and the fact that FRL wasn't designed to be used as a measure for low SES (Harwell and Lebeau 2010 ; National Forum on Education Statistics 2015; Recommendations to the National Center for Education Statistics 2012).\nParticularly problematic when analyzing student poverty and achievement, a plurality of students now has FRL status according to the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP).\nHowever, as FRL is often the best available measure, the indicator continues to be used as a proxy for low SES (e.g. Jennings et al. 2015 , Papay et al. 2015 Rondfelt et al. 2013; Kalogrides and Loeb 2013) . Other studies have employed alternative measures of student SES, such as family income (Chmielewski and Reardon 2016; Reardon, 2011) and parental education (Bradbury et al. 2015) , but, like FRL, these indicators focus on only one dimension of student disadvantage.\nHowever, there is strong reason to believe that SES, and more specifically child poverty, is a multidimensional rather than unitary phenomenon. Family wealth, parental occupational status, and parental education all have distinct effects (Sirin 2005) . Focusing on only one dimension could give a misleading picture of a child's true position. For example, two students could each have similar levels of family wealth but very different levels of parental education and, hence, very different relative advantages. One approach for addressing this issue is to employ indices that combine indicators representing multiple dimensions: household possessions, parental education, family income, and occupational status. The most prominent sources for these indices are the U.S. Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (ECLS), focused on younger children, and the OECD PISA, which tests 15-year-olds. The ECLS has been used to examine the Black-White achievement gap in kindergarten using SES as a control (Quinn 2015) and to estimate the difference in student performance between the top and bottom SES quintiles in kindergarten (Garcia 2015) . The PISA's index of economic, social, and cultural status (ESCS) was used by Schmidt et al. (2015) to estimate achievement gaps between the top and bottom SES quartiles among all OECD countries.\nWe present a summary of the aforementioned research estimating SES achievement gaps in mathematics in the U.S. in Table 1 . Whichever measure or population is considered, the basic pattern is the same: lower-SES students do substantially worse than their more advantaged peers.\nNotably, the gaps range from .8 to 1.3 standard deviations, despite very different thresholds (top and bottom quartiles, quintiles, deciles, etc.)."}, {"section_title": "Table 1 Here", "text": "These studies all have their limitations, however.

Especially in the U.S., race is identified as an important predictor of educational achievement (Hemphill and Vanneman 2011; Vanneman et al. 2009 ). In general, White and Asian students perform above their African American, Hispanic, and Native American peers (Kao and Thompson 2003; Lee 2002) .

Similarly, several studies have demonstrated that early childhood education appears to increase future educational achievement (Campbell and Ramey 1994; Larsen and Robinson 1989; Lee et al. 1990) . At the policy level, there is also evidence to suggest that school truancy and classroom tardiness among poor students are both associated with low achievement scores (Atkinson 2005; Baker, Sigmon, and Nugent, 2001; Epstein and Sheldon 2002; Marvul 2012) .\nUnfortunately, issues around truancy and tardiness have often been found to be associated with poverty (Marvul) .\nEducation aspiration has also been linked to academic achievement, especially among poor students (Kao and Thompson 2003; Kao and Tienda 1998; Mau, 1995) .

The PISA uses a complex two-stage clustered sampling design. In the first stage, approximately 150 schools are chosen based on a probability that is proportional to the school's size (Rust 2014) . Then, a random sample of 35 15-year-olds is selected for testing. In addition to an achievement test of math, science, and reading, students are administered a background questionnaire that asks about their lives and school situations, attitudes, and experiences in and outside of school (OECD 2014b). In total, students are tested for 120 minutes, with a subsequent 30 minutes allotted to filling out the background questionnaire. The unweighted U.S. PISA 2012 sample size was 8,609 students (Kastberg et al. 2014) ."}, {"section_title": "Measures", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Outcome", "text": "The PISA is administered every three years and measures math, science, and reading literacy. In each cycle, one content area is considered the major domain (math in 2012) and is measured more thoroughly than the other two domains, which are considered minor domains (OECD 2014b). For our analysis, we used mathematics achievement as our outcome of interest, which is scaled using item response theory (Embretson and Reise 2000) to a mean of 500 and a standard deviation of 100 (OECD 2014b, 159) . Because the PISA features complex booklet designs, the methods used to estimate achievement are similar to multiple imputation (Rubin 1987 ) and result in several plausible values for each student. These values are intended to be used as population estimates of achievement, rather than as individual estimates (Mislevy 1984; Mislevy et al. 1992) . As recommended in the literature, we use all five plausible values of math achievement and combine them according to recommended practice (Rutkowski et al. 2010) ."}, {"section_title": "Poverty or treatment condition", "text": "The PISA 2012 database (Kastberg et al. 2014) Rather, ESCS relies on more indirect measures that can reasonably be asked of a 15-year-old who might not be able to accurately provide more direct information. Nevertheless, the ESCS measure has been used extensively as a proxy for SES (for two recent examples in top journals see Parker et al. 2016; S\u00e4\u00e4lik, Nissinen, and Malin 2015) . To create poverty categories, we used the UNICEF (2014) finding that 32.2 percent of U.S. children were living in poverty in 2012.\nGiven the PISA's stringent sampling techniques, which ensure a representative sample of 15-year-olds in the U.S., 2 we assigned a poverty indicator of 1 to all children at or below the 32.2 percentile on the ESCS index value. All other children were coded 0, or not in poverty. We refer to this variable as the treatment condition throughout this paper. Although the PISA target population is one year older than the UNICEF-defined child, there is little reason to believe that the poverty situation of a 15-year-old population in the U.S. would be substantially different from that of those under 15, particularly given that both populations are required to be enrolled in school.\n3"}, {"section_title": "Covariates", "text": "To approximate an experimental setting, we used PSM, whereby the treatment and control groups are matched according to the probability of being in the treatment group (in poverty). An important feature of PSM is that the probability of being in the treatment group is estimated for all students, regardless of their actual poverty status. The treatment and control groups are thus balanced on the set of covariates, providing some assurance that observed differences in the outcome are not due to other factors.\nCreating a propensity score involves specifying a logistic regression model from covariates that are associated with the treatment condition; however, there is some debate over model specification. Whereas some authors argue in favor of adding many covariates (Rubin and Thomas 1996) , others argue that over-parameterization (Bryson, Dorsett, and Purdon, 2002) can increase the variance of the propensity scores, among other problems. As such, we opted for an approach that sought a wide spectrum of covariates supported by theory.\nDue to the extant nature of PISA data and the fact that the 2012 cycle implemented a rotated background questionnaire (meaning that not all students completed all questionnaire items), we were limited by the available variables asked of all U.S. students in the background questionnaire. Furthermore, there are potentially important influences on student achievement that may also be related to student poverty that were not included in the PISA. We recognize this as one possible limitation to our study. In addition, we excluded school-based covariates such as opportunity to learn (OTL) from our model, in order to develop an estimate of the aggregate effect of poverty. The inclusion of OTL, school resources, and other variables could certainly influence the estimate, but is outside the scope of the present work.\nBriefly, we included race/ethnicity, preschool and kindergarten attendance, grade repetition, truancy/tardiness frequency, academic aspirations, parental presence at home, full-or part-time work of parents, immigration status, and whether English is spoken at home. We dummy coded each of the covariates in our model.

When the assumption holds, we can estimate an unbiased average effect of poverty on achievement (McEwan 2010; Rosenbaum and Rubin, 1983; Steiner and Cook 2013) .\nLogistic regression models were fit to the treatment variables to create propensity scores on which to match. We included as covariates those student background variables listed in Appendix 1A. In an effort to generate a high-quality match, we explored several matching algorithms, including one-to-one and one-to-two nearest neighbor matching (NN and 2NN, respectively), with and without replacement, and with and without calipers (.010, .025, and .050). We used the package \"Matching\" (Sekhon 2013) in R 3.1.2 (The R Foundation 2015).\nBased on several criteria, discussed subsequently, we chose the 2NN matching algorithm with replacement and a caliper of .05 as our matching procedure.\nTo evaluate the quality of the matching procedure, we evaluated the common support, or regions where the control sample's propensity scores matched the treatment sample's propensity scores through graphical analysis of the samples' distributions, minima and maxima comparison, and trimming (Caliendo and Kopeinig 2008; see also Caliendo, Hujer, and Thomsen 2005) .\nFurther, we estimated the pseudo-R 2 from the propensity score regression with samples from the treatment and control groups before and after matching (Caliendo and Kopeinig; Sianesi 2004 );\nwe calculated the t-test for significant differences between the covariates of the control and treatment groups before and after matching; and we found the mean standardized bias (MSB)\nbetween covariates before and after matching (Caliendo and Kopeinig 2008; Rosenbaum and Rubin 1985) . The MSB is a simple average over covariates of the standardized bias (SB), which is calculated as:\nwhere \u0305 1 ( \u0305 0 ) is the mean of the covariate of the treatment (control) group, and V 1 (X) [V 0 (X)] is the variance of covariate X of the treatment (control) group. The mean of all covariates' SBs was found before and after matching. As a critical final check, we conducted a sensitivity analysis to ascertain whether hidden bias due to unobserved heterogeneity might threaten the validity of results.

However, since we do not have experimental data, the process of \"selecting\" oneself into or out of poverty is non-random, leading to the likely problem of selection bias.

The highest losses come from characteristics related to tardiness or truancy from school. A loss of 3% comes from students who aspire to less than an associate's degree. Overall, the treatment group lost only 1.1% of the sample, suggesting that the matched control group is comparable to most students in the treatment sample, and common support was found across the groups and their relevant characteristics. Table 5 presents the comparisons between the pseudo-R 2 values and the MSB for the covariates before and after matching. Systematic differences between the distribution of covariates after matching should be eliminated, so we expect the pseudo-R 2 values to be lower after matching, which is, indeed, the case. Likelihood ratio tests (LRTs) before and after matching drop as expected, although the joint significance of covariates remains after matching. Overall, these indicators point to a balanced quality matching between samples."}, {"section_title": "Table 5 Here", "text": "Results from the t-test for covariate balance between control and treatment groups also suggest improved matching balance (Table 6 ). Before matching, 13 of 15 covariates displayed significant differences between the control and treatment groups; after matching, four variablestwo tied to the student's father's working status, whether the student is Black, and whether the student had been born outside of the U.S.-showed significant differences between the control and treatment groups. However, Imai, King, and Stuart (2008) suggested that the t-test may be a misleading indicator of individual covariate balance if used as evidence by itself. Steiner and Cook (2013) recommended plotting the standardized differences (or Cohen's d) of each covariate and its variance ratio before and after matching. They also call for checking for standardized differences different from zero, greater than magnitude .1 and variance ratios different from one, greater than magnitude .2.\nFigures 1 and 2 suggest that the balance after matching is well within these parameters, with only one variable (three or four times truant in last two weeks) slightly outside the suggested range for the variance ratios. Please note that figure 2 is on a different scale to clearly show the magnitude of the change after matching. Since this departure generally aligns with the recommended bounds, we conclude that the balance after matching is satisfactory. In addition to Rosenbaum's bounds technique for sensitivity analysis, we performed a second test, which, while less formal, still supports the findings above. We split the control group before matching into two random halves and then implemented identical matching procedures-finding the propensity score regression, estimating the effect with a 2NN matching algorithm with replacement and a caliper of .05, and checking balance. Each half resulted in propensity score models that were nearly identical to the model in Table 3 , with the only differences being in some proxy variables that measure the same latent characteristic as a variable in the original model (for example, a student having skipped five or more days in the past two weeks as opposed to three or more in the full matched dataset model). Next, a single propensity score model was used for each random half, and the treatment condition effect was estimated for each half, resulting in -28.535 and -26.404 with standard errors of 1.94 and 1.86, respectively. These findings are similar to the original findings of -26.745 with a standard error of 1.54 in Table 4 . While the matching quality was not as high as the full matched dataset, estimating the effect with two random sub-samples did not show great departure, and this evidence combined with the sensitivity analysis above, suggests that our findings are relatively robust to unobserved hidden bias."}, {"section_title": "Discussion/Conclusion", "text": "Based on an analysis of PISA 2012 data, our findings suggest that, after matching on a set of covariates identified in the literature as important predictors of poverty status, students in poverty have notable educational attainment deficiencies compared to a matched sample of students who are not in poverty. In other words, when we select two students who have a great deal in common but for the fact that one comes from a poverty background, the poor student is expected to perform about a quarter of a standard deviation lower on the PISA assessment. This estimate is substantially lower than that reported by Garcia's (2015) early childhood study (.76) as well as the NAEP (2015) estimates controlling for race (.70 to .50), but is closer to the effect size (.35) in Sirin's (2005) meta-analysis.\nWe believe these results have a number of important implications with respect to future research, social equity, and educational and economic policy. First, we contend that the PISA is a powerful tool for discussions around poverty, given that the assessment is focused on the skills students need to participate in a global economy rather than an intended curriculum. As such, our findings suggest that poverty is, in and of itself, a catalyst for lower achievement, suggesting that a third of the U.S. population is less prepared to operate in the global economy.\nCommensurately, it is reasonable to expect that having fewer skills to participate in the economy would likely lead to lower earnings and a higher chance of living in poverty. This process intensifies the so-called cycle of poverty, a phenomenon in which once a family enters poverty, subsequent generations also live in poverty.\nSecond, these results highlight the distinction between poverty and race on student achievement. Although race and poverty are correlated, they are not substitutes. Black and Hispanic students have double the poverty rates of Whites (DeNavas-Walt and Proctor 2015), statistics that can make it difficult for educational researchers to separate race and poverty in achievement studies. Interestingly, we were able to match students in poverty to students who have similar attributes but who are not in poverty to examine difference in their scores. This statistical matching technique allowed us to estimate less-biased estimates of poverty, demonstrating that, beyond race, ethnicity, or immigrant status, poverty on its own contributes to substantively lower achievement. Although this finding may seem intuitive, our analysis provides a concrete and more accurate estimate of the negative effects of poverty on PISA achievement in the U.S. Importantly, this finding is worth highlighting given growing numbers of children in poverty. Furthermore, although we use race as a matching variable in our study, we do not intend to suggest that biological or ethno-cultural factors are responsible for achievement differences. Rather, race likely serves as a proxy for societal and other conditions experienced by racial and ethnic minorities in the US.\nOur findings clearly speak to issues around social justice; however, they are also relevant to economic policy. For some time, researchers and economic organizations such as the OECD have suggested that increases in PISA scores have a positive effect on national economic growth (Hanushek and Woessmann 2010) . Although claims about the actual effect of increased PISA scores on the national economy can vary, there is strong evidence that the effect is positive. As such, the U.S. potentially has a great deal to gain by reducing poverty rates, which are much higher than those of other OECD countries. In fact, a number of European countries have poverty rates that are less than half those of the U.S., including Germany, Sweden, Denmark, and\nPoland. Strikingly, the social safety net in these countries is generally well-developed in comparison to the U.S., pointing to one possible means to alleviate poverty. Additionally, our analysis of the PISA demonstrates that there is a great deal of untapped potential in the U.S., as measured by a meaningful poverty-based achievement gap. This potential is being stifled by poverty, beyond a host of other demographic variables, including race, ethnicity, immigration background, and other factors. In essence, 32% of the U.S. population is underperforming on the PISA test due to being in poverty. And if the PISA can be regarded as one indicator of the stock of skills that the up-and-coming workforce brings to the labor market and to higher education, clearly, this group is at a marked disadvantage. Given that wealth gaps in the U.S. continue to grow and poverty continues to rise (DeNavas-Walt and Proctor 2015; UNICEF Office of Research 2014), underperformance on the PISA will most likely increase over time, leading to lost opportunities and greater untapped potential. In a global knowledge economy, not exploiting this potential is a loss of efficiency in economic terms as well as a social injustice.\nOur findings are also relevant to educational policy. Because students in poverty substantially underperform their peers even after accounting for race, immigration status, aspirations, and pre-K education, our results suggest that educational interventions must be focused on the specific effects of student poverty, not generic student underperformance. Schools in the U.K. have experimented with strategies that target support for poorer students within given schools, for example through the use of the \"pupil premium.\" These sorts of policies might also be promising in a U.S. context.\nAs analysts of secondary data, we no doubt suffer limitations to our study. First, the cross-sectional nature of the data limits what we can say about our findings and what we are able to measure. Although the procedure used for our analysis creates groups of students matched on important confounders of poverty, our poverty estimate might not be completely unbiased, as unobserved heterogeneity cannot be completely ruled out. In particular, the possibility remains that the PISA database does not include all important matching variables, leaving open the possibility of some persistent omitted variable bias. To that end, we included only covariates from the core block of the background questionnaire due to planned exclusion in the questionnaire design. Nevertheless, we followed best practice in model selection, robustness checks, and sensitivity analysis to avoid introducing unnecessary bias in our models (King and Nielsen 2016) . Our robustness analysis showed stable estimates of poverty across a range of conditions, providing some assurance that our estimates of poverty on achievement are reasonably unbiased. Finally, we treated poverty as a dichotomous variable. As such, the poverty estimate compared the average achievement across these two groups. It is reasonable that at the extreme ends of the SES distribution, estimated achievement differences would be much larger.\nNevertheless, these findings offer evidence that poverty has a meaningful impact on PISA results, pointing to a real need for addressing the widening SES gap in the U.S. Mother at home missing Q14HM_FA Father Q14HM_FA_Miss"}, {"section_title": "Notes on contributors", "text": "Father at home missing Q14HM_BRO Brother Q14HM_BRO_Miss\nBrother at home missing Q14HM_SIS Sister Q14HM_SIS_Miss\nSister at home missing Q14HM_GRA Grandparent(s) Q14HM_GRA_Miss Grandparent(s) at home missing Q14HM_OTH\nOther people Q14HM_OTH_Miss\nOther people at home missing Parent/Guardian type of work Q19MWK_FL\nMother has work full-time Q19MWK_PT\nMother has work part-time Q19MOTH\nMother has other type of work Q19MWK_Miss\nMother's work missing Q24FWK_FL\nFather has work full-time"}]
