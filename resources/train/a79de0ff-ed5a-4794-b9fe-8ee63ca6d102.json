[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Human to human transmission of this viral infection occurs via the droplets expelled during the face to face talking, coughing and sneezing. The time of exposure is very crucial factors for the transmission of infection from an infected person to a healthy person. Prolonged exposure has a high risk of transmission while shot exposure is less likely to transmit. It takes an average of 11.5 days to develop the symptoms of the disease after the successful transmission to a healthy person (Tang et al., 2020; Wiersing et al., 2020) . Common symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea. The disease has emerged as a critical, rapidly evolving global health crisis (Yin et al., 2020; Zheng et al., 2020) . More than 6.5 million people have contracted the virus, and nearly 400 thousand have died (CSSE, 2020) . In Bangladesh, the COVID-19 was first reported on 7 March by the Institute of Epidemiology Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) (Paul, 2020) . Until the end of March, the infection rate was sort of low; however, as the non-therapeutic prevention measures enforced by the government faced enormous challenges, the infection rate raised drastically in April and kept on rising (Nabi and Shovon, 2020) . The people did not maintain the social distancing enforced by the government and trend to gather in crowded places (The Business Standard, 2020). Moreover, an inadequacy of testing for COVID-19 diagnosis is a common criticism in Bangladesh (Tithila, 2020) . As of 31 August 2020, nearly 313,000 confirmed cases were reported, with a total of 4,281 deaths in Bangladesh (IEDCR, 2020).\nSARS-CoV-2 is a positive-stranded RNA virus with a genome of ~ 30kb, encodes structural and nonstructural proteins. SARS-CoV-2 is a spherical-shaped enveloped virus and characterized by spike proteins projecting from the virion surface. Generally, the viral structure is formed with some structural proteins such as spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E) and nucleocapsid (N) protein where S, M and E proteins are embedded in the viral envelope and N protein is located in the core regions (Ashour et al., 2020) . Like other RNA viruses, the SARS-CoV-2 is prone to frequent mutations, which makes it challenging to develop therapeutics and vaccines against the virus (Ruan et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2020) .\nSequence information of both the pathogen and the host would greatly facilitate an effective therapeutic strategy or vaccine development (Seib et al., 2020) . Analysis of the genome sequences obtained from a vast array of isolates collected from different regions could provide an idea about the efficacy of the vaccines being developed (Amanat and Krammer, 2020) . Henceforth, researchers across the world are running against time to unravel the genomic insights into the virus.\nTill the end of August 2020, more than 80,000 genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 has been submitted from different countries, where most of the sequences have come from European countries (~46000). About 20,000 complete genome sequences have been submitted from the USA while China has submitted about 1000 genome sequences. In Bangladesh, more than 300 isolates of the virus have been J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f sequenced and deposited in GSAID (Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data) database until the end of August 2020. Unfortunately, there is yet a study on the genomics of the SARS-CoV-2 in Bangladeshi isolates.\nThis study aimed to provide some preliminary insights into the genetic structure of all isolates reported in Bangladesh along with the mutational spectrum. It presents the first study on SARS-CoV-2 genomes obtained from Bangladesh, which, in broader terms, would help the therapeutic strategy development and vaccination programs against the virus in the country."}, {"section_title": "Retrieval of the Genome Sequences of SARS-CoV-2", "text": "Till the end of August, more than 300 genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 isolates were deposited from Bangladesh in the GSAID database (https://www.gisaid.org/) and we retrieved all of them from the database. As many of the Bangladeshi people return during the COVID-19 outbreak mainly from China, India, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Italy, Japan, Qatar, Canada, Kuwait, USA, France, Sweden, and Switzerland, the first deposited genome sequence of those countries were also retrieved. Sequence information of the first isolate collected from China was considered as a reference for further analysis."}, {"section_title": "Multiple Sequence Alignment and Phylogenetic Tree Reconstruction", "text": "Multiple sequence alignment of all genome sequences of Bangladeshi isolates along with other countries was done using MUSCLE alignment program (Edger, 2004) . This alignment file was further proceeded for the reconstruction of the phylogenetic tree with Maximum Likelihood (ML) method using IQ-TREE (Nguyen et al., 2015) . Model test was performed by ModelFinder tools to select the best-fit substitution model for the tree reconstruction (Kalyaanamoorthy et al., 2017) . A total number of 88 models were tested and the best-fit model (GTR+F+I+G4) was selected according to Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Besides, to assess the branch supports, the ultrafast bootstrap was performed adopting UFBoot2 and the number of bootstrap replicates was set to 1000 (Hoang et al., 2018) . Finally, the reconstructed phylogenetic tree was visualized and analyzed by iTOL online tool (Letunic and Bork, 2019)."}, {"section_title": "Identification of Nucleotide Variations in Bangladeshi Strain", "text": "To identify the nucleotide variations, we performed multiple sequence alignment using Clustal Omega "}, {"section_title": "Prediction and Identification of the Viral Genes", "text": "FGENESV of SoftBerry (http://linux1.softberry.com/berry.phtml), which is a Trained Pattern/Markov chain-based viral gene prediction tools, was adopted for the prediction of the genes as well as the proteins from the viral genomes.

The identity of each protein was evaluated compared to the proteins of the reference strain."}, {"section_title": "Detection of Mutation Spectrum", "text": "Again, Clustal Omega was used for the multiple sequence alignment of each protein, which further analyzed by MVIEW. The amino acid variations were identified in each protein comparing to the protein of the reference strain.

The homology modeling of all mutant spike proteins along with the spike protein of the reference was done using SWISS-MODEL (Schwede et al., 2003) . The validation of the predicted model was done by adopting Rampage and ERRAT (Colovos and Yeates, 1993; Lovell, 2003 )."}, {"section_title": "Molecular Docking of Spike Protein with ACE2 Receptor", "text": "The molecular docking approach was employed to investigate the interaction of mutant spike protein with the human ACE2 receptor. First, the crystal structure of human ACE2 (PDB ID: 6D0G) was obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB), and PyMOL was used to clean the structure to remove all the complex molecules and water (Berman et al., 2000; DeLano, 2002) . The HDOCK webserver was used for J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f prediction of the interaction between Spike protein and human ACE2 receptor through the protein-protein molecular docking (Yan et al., 2017) . PyMOL was also used for the visualization of docking interactions."}, {"section_title": "Retrieved Genome Sequence of the SARS-CoV-2", "text": "A total number of 311 complete genome sequences of the SARS-CoV-2 isolates from Bangladesh and 12 genome sequence from the isolates of other countries (China, India, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Italy, Japan, Qatar, Canada, Kuwait, USA, France, Sweden, and Switzerland) have been retrieved from GSAID.

The isolates collected from Chittagong also centroid with the Middle East countries such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. Moreover, all the isolates initially collected before the pandemic started in Bangladesh were clustered with the strain of China indicating the same lineage of the virus. However, the phylogenetic distance of the isolates from this lineage increased over time."}, {"section_title": "Predictions of the Genes and Proteins", "text": "FGENESV predicted the presence of 12 genes in the reference. Interestingly, all except five isolates (EPI_ISL_445213, EPI_ISL_445214, EPI_ISL_450342, EPI_ISL_450343, and EPI_ISL_450344) of Bangladesh also showed a similar result. Both isolates EPI_ISL_445213 and EPI_ISL_445217 found to have ten genes (missing of ORF7a and ORF10 genes) and isolate EPI_ISL_450343 and EPI_ISL_450344 have 11 genes (missing ORF8 gene). Multiple sequence alignment revealed that most of the variation in Bangladeshi isolates occurred in the ORF1a polyprotein, surface glycoproteins, and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein. Remarkably, envelope glycoprotein, ORF6, ORF8, and ORF10 were found 100% identical in most of the isolates compared to the reference sequence (Table 1) ."}, {"section_title": "J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f", "text": "Analysis of all 14 Bangladeshi isolates revealed a total of 42 single nucleotide variants (Fig 2) ; 24 of them were nonsynonymous missense in character.

Mutations located in the ORF1a polyprotein and surface glycoprotein were predicted to decrease the structural stability of both proteins (Table 3) . Additionally, three mutations occurring in surface glycoprotein, ORF3a and ORF6 were predicted to alter the molecular consequences, including loss of sulfation in surface glycoprotein and loss of proteolytic cleavage in ORF3a and loss of allosteric site in ORF6 (Table 4 and Supplementary Table 1 )."}, {"section_title": "Prediction and Validation of the Homology Models", "text": "In total, three models were generated using the template PDB ID: 6VSB; one model for the spike protein of reference strain, and the two others were for two different mutant isolates from Bangladesh (Fig 3) .\nTwo types of mutations were found in the spike proteins of all Bangladeshi isolates, where most of the isolates were found to contain a substitution of D623G. Only one strain, EPI_ISL_445214, found to have two substitutions; one was similar to the previous substitution, and the other was F1118L. The validation assessment scores of these three models were mostly similar to the template, which provided the reliability of these models (Table 5 )."}, {"section_title": "Analysis of the Interaction Between Spike Proteins and Human ACE2 Receptor", "text": "HDOCK server was used to predict the interaction between the above-mentioned 3D models of reference spike proteins along with mutant models and the human ACE2 receptor. Interestingly, this molecular docking analysis revealed that the docking score for the three models against the human ACE2 receptor was similar, and it was -244.42 (Table 6) ; mutation in the spike proteins do not hamper binding with ACE2 receptor. For three spike protein models, this study found that a domain of spike protein instead of whole protein, amino acid ranging from 345 to 527, was involved in the interactions. This domain was conserved in all isolates resulting in similar interactions with ACE2 (Fig 4) . Bangladesh, resulting in no effect of the mutations. A recent study identified the receptor-binding domain of spike protein, amino acid ranging from 319 to 541, to interact with the ACE2 receptor, which is similar to our findings (Lan et al., 2020).
