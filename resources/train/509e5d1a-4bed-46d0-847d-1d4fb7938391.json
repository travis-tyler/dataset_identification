[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "The panel recognizes that prostate cancer represents a true spectrum of disease and that not all men diagnosed with prostate cancer require treatment. The panel believes that maximizing the detection of early prostate cancer will increase the detection of both indolent (slower-growing) and aggressive (faster-growing) prostate cancers. The challenge is to minimize immediate treatment (over-treatment) of indolent cancers by accurately characterizing the biology of the detected cancer. Identifi cation and selective treatment of aggressive cancers should result in signifi cant decreases in morbidity and mortality while limiting adverse effects on quality of life.The NCCN Guidelines for Prostate Cancer Early Detection do not address the treatment of prostate cancer. See the NCCN Guidelines for Prostate Cancer for prostate cancer treatment recommendations (to view the most recent verstion, visit NCCN.org). It is the intention of the panel that these guidelines be linked and, specifi cally, early detection strategies that do not recognize the importance of refi ned and selective treatment may result in harm.\nThe guidelines are specifi cally for men opting to participate in an early detection program (after receiving the appropriate counseling on the pros and cons). It is the majority opinion of the NCCN Prostate Cancer Early Detection Panel Members that there is a growing population of men currently being diagnosed with prostate cancer who can, and should, be monitored for their disease as presented in the NCCN Guidelines for Prostate Cancer (available at NCCN.org). The guidelines for when to start and stop screening, at what intervals to conduct screening, and when to biopsy were recommended by most panel members, but a consensus was not reached. The guidelines are continuously in a state of evolution, and the panel will incorporate changes based on new evidence and expert opinion and provide a rating of consensus for each recommendation.\nProstate Cancer Early Detection, Version 2.2015 Repeat testing at 1-2 year intervals a The best evidence supports the use of serum PSA for the early detection of prostate cancer. DRE should not be used as a stand-alone test, but should be performed in those with an elevated serum PSA. DRE may be considered as a baseline test in all patients as it may identify high-risk cancers associated with \"normal\" serum PSA values. Medications such as 5\u03b1-reductase inhibitors (finasteride and dutasteride) are known to decrease PSA by approximately 50%, and PSA values in these men should be corrected accordingly. b Testing above the age of 75 years of age should be done with caution and only in very healthy men with little or no comorbidity as a large proportion may harbor cancer that would be unlikely to affect their life expectancy, and screening in this population would substantially increase rates of over-detection. However, a clinically significant number of men in this age group may present with high-risk cancers that pose a significant risk if left undetected until signs or symptoms develop. One could consider increasing the PSA threshold for biopsy in this group (ie, >4 ng/mL). Very few men above the age of 75 years benefit from PSA testing. c The reported median PSA values for men aged 40-49 y range from 0.5-0.7 ng/mL, and the 75th percentile values range from 0.7-0.9 ng/mL. Therefore, the PSA value of 1.0 ng/mL selects for the upper range of PSA values. Men who have a PSA above the median for their age group are at a higher risk for prostate cancer and for the aggressive form of the disease. The higher above the median, the greater the risk. Finally, men at age 60 years with a serum PSA <1.0 ng/mL have a very low risk of metastases or death due to prostate cancer. Similarly, a cut point of 3.0 ng/mL at age 75 years also has a low risk of such outcomes."}, {"section_title": "NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology", "text": "\nf It is well known that a negative biopsy does not preclude a diagnosis of prostate cancer on subsequent biopsy.

Although primarily confined to the seminal plasma, PSA enters the circulation through unknown mechanisms. Many commercially available sources of PSA antibodies for serum tests are available worldwide. With the exception of minor differences in the calibration of these assays, they perform comparably when used appropriately. However, PSA measures obtained using different commercial assays are not directly comparable or interchangeable, since the values are calibrated against different standards. If an abnormally high PSA level is observed, consideration should be given to repeat testing, particularly if the value is close to the threshold.\nPSA is not a cancer-specific marker, and therefore most men with elevated PSA levels do not have prostate cancer. In fact, only about 25% of men with PSA in the 4 to 10 ng/mL range have a subsequent positive biopsy. 4 Additionally, men with low PSA values have a significant chance of having prostate cancer. Using data from 18,882 men in the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT), Thompson et al 5 determined the sensitivity and specificity of PSA levels for detecting any prostate cancer using various cut-offs. At 3.1 ng/mL, PSA has a sensitivity of about 32% and a specificity of about 87%.\nDespite its limitations, recent population-based prostate cancer screening studies have shown survival benefits using PSA, sometimes in combination with digital rectal examination (DRE) or other ancillary tests, as discussed in more detail in the following sections. Factors Affecting PSA Levels: PSA can be elevated due to infection, recent instrumentation, ejaculation, or trauma. However, empiric antibiotic use appears to have little value for improving test performance in asymptomatic men with an elevated PSA. 6 The 5\u03b1-reductase inhibitors (5-ARI) finasteride and dutasteride are commonly used to treat lower urinary tract symptoms due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Use and duration of 5-ARI therapy should be elicited carefully in the history, because this class of drugs typically results in an approximate 50% decrease in serum PSA levels within 6 to 12\nText cont. from page 1535. months of initiating therapy. 7 However, this effect is tremendously variable. For example, one study showed that after 12 months of treatment, only 35% of men demonstrated the expected 40% to 60% decrease in PSA, while another 30% had greater than a 60% decrease. 8 Thus, the commonly employed method of doubling the measured PSA value to obtain an adjusted value may result in unreliable cancer detection.\nIn fact, failure to achieve a significant PSA decrease while taking 5-ARIs can indicate a heightened risk for prostate cancer that warrants regular testing. Results from several clinical trials suggested that 5-ARIs enhance the predictive capacity of PSA, 9, 10 but reflex ranges for PSA among patients on 5-ARIs have not been established. The PCPT of 18,882 men demonstrated that finasteride reduced the incidence of prostate cancer by 25% compared with placebo. This reduction was almost exclusively for low-grade (Gleason sum 6) tumors; an increased proportion of aggressive (Gleason sum \u22657) tumors was seen. 11 However, after 18 years of follow-up, no significant group difference was seen in overall survival or survival after the diagnosis of prostate cancer in those on finasteride compared with the control group. 12 In the Reduction by Dutasteride of Prostate Cancer Events (REDUCE) trial, PSA detected more high-grade tumors in the dutasteride arm, while the overall prostate cancer diagnosis fell by 23% compared with control. 10 Similar to the PCPT trial, the difference in the number of high-grade cancers detected did not result in a mortality difference. 13 A report on the Combination of Avodart (dutasteride) and Tamsulosin (CombAT) trial also showed a 40% lower incidence of prostate cancer with dutasteride plus tamsulosin (another BPH drug) compared with tamsulosin alone, along with a slightly improved yield of PSA-driven biopsy.\n14 Unlike the PCPT and REDUCE studies, diagnosis of high-grade (Gleason sum \u22657) tumors was not increased. Overall, these studies suggest that PSA testing may have enhanced specificity for men receiving finasteride or dutasteride. Whether or not men should consider taking these agents for chemoprevention is beyond the scope of this guideline.\nKetoconazole, commonly used to treat fungal conditions, inhibits the androgen synthesis pathway and hence can also lower PSA levels. Since moderate PSA decreases have been seen with ketoconazole in the treatment of patients with prostate cancer after failure of hormonal therapy, 15 recent ketoconazole use should also be noted in the history.\nA health survey on 12,457 men visiting a prostate cancer screening clinic showed that more than 20% of men take herbal supplements, while only 10% take prescription medication (such as finasteride) for lower urinary tract symptoms. 16 Several of these herbal supplements, such as saw palmetto, may contain phytoestrogenic compounds that can affect serum PSA levels. Very little is known about the exact composition of these herbal supplements and their specific effects on serum PSA levels.\nOverall, appropriate use of PSA testing alone can provide a diagnostic lead-time of 5 to 10 years, but the lead-time varies across studies, populations, and screening protocols. 17 Since the introduction of PSA testing, there has been an increase in the detection of early-stage, organ-confined disease and a decrease in disease that is metastatic at the time of diagnosis. 18 The risk of prostate cancer increases with increasing PSA, but there is no level of PSA below which the risk of prostate cancer can be eliminated. The PCPT showed that 15% of men with a PSA level of 4.0 ng/mL or less and a normal DRE had prostate cancer (as diagnosed using end-of-study biopsies). 19 Approximately 30% to 35% of men with serum PSAs in the 4 to 10 ng/mL range will be found to have cancer. Total PSA (tPSA) levels greater than10 ng/mL confer a greater than 67% likelihood of biopsy-detectable prostate cancer."}, {"section_title": "20", "text": "Controversies of PSA Testing: The decision about whether to pursue early detection of prostate cancer is complex. When, who, and how often to test remain major topics of debate. PSA screening has played a critical role in the downward migration of prostate cancer stage seen over the past decades. The incidence of metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis has decreased dramatically since 1988. 21, 22 As a result of early detection strategies, considerable stage migration has occurred in the past 2 decades in the United States. This trend has likely, but not definitely, contributed to a substantial reduction in prostate cancer mortality. 23, 24 Still, although prostate cancer is a major cause of death and disability in the United States, many argue that the benefits of early detection are, at best, moderate, and that early detection often results in overdetection. Overdetection is the identification of indolent disease, disease that would not be a problem for the patient if undetected or untreated. These arguments hold that overdetection may lead to overtreatment, which is aggressive treatment in men with a low probability of yielding clinical benefit.\nIn addition, PSA testing often produces falsepositive results, which in turn contribute to patient anxiety and the increased costs and potential complications associated with unnecessary biopsies. On the basis of its perception of the harm-benefit tradeoffs of prostate cancer screening, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has recommended against routine PSA testing."}, {"section_title": "25", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "DRE", "text": "Best evidence supports the use of serum PSA for the early detection of prostate cancer. Still, many experts continue to recommend DRE for screening, as some clinically significant cancers may potentially be missed using a serum PSA cut-point alone. Studies have consistently shown that prostate cancer cases detected through PSA testing are more often confined to the prostate than those detected solely by DRE. 26, 27 Currently, 81% of prostate cancers are pathologically organ-confined at time of diagnosis. 28 Recent screening trials have either used DRE in conjunction with PSA for screening 29 or as an ancillary test for patients who are found to have an elevated PSA. 30, 31 To elucidate the specific role of DRE in screening for prostate cancer, Gosselaar et al 32 showed that among those with a serum PSA greater than 3 ng/mL, those with a positive DRE were more likely to have prostate cancer. Furthermore, among 5519 men in the control arm of the PCPT, Thompson et al 33 observed that an abnormal DRE increased the probability of cancer detection by almost 2.5 fold in multivariable analysis; the risk of high-grade disease was increased 2.7 fold with an abnormal DRE.\nHowever, in men with normal PSA, the positive predictive value (PPV) of DRE is poor (about 4%-11%). 34, 35 Therefore, an abnormal DRE result alone as an indication for biopsy would lead to a large number of unnecessary biopsies and the detection of many insignificant cancers in men with low PSA values. In fact, in an analysis of 166,104 men with prostate cancer diagnosed between 2004 and 2007 from the SEER database, only 685 (0.4%) had palpable, PSA-occult (PSA level of <2.5 ng/mL), Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer. 36 Overall, the panel believes that the value of DRE as a stand-alone test for prostate detection is limited, even though DRE picks up some cases of advanced cancer that would otherwise be missed. Therefore, the panel recommends DRE as a complementary test that may be considered with serum PSA in asymptomatic men who had a risk/benefit discussion and decided to pursue screening for prostate cancer. Furthermore, the panel believes that DRE should not be used as a stand-alone test without PSA testing. Finally, the panel believes that DRE should be performed in all men with an abnormal serum PSA to aid in decisions regarding biopsy (see \"Pre-Biopsy Workup,\" page 1547)."}, {"section_title": "Population-Based Screening Studies", "text": "Although many trials have been cited with regard to PSA testing, 2 studies are most relevant due to their topicality and randomized design."}, {"section_title": "European Randomised Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) Trial", "text": "The ERSPC involved about 182,000 men between the ages of 50 and 74 years in 7 European countries, randomly assigned to a group that was offered PSA screening at an average of once every 4 years or to a control group that did not receive such screening; DRE or other ancillary tests were also performed in the screening group. 31, 37 The predefined core group included 162,388 men aged 55 to 69 years. Death from prostate cancer was the primary outcome. During a median follow-up of 11 years, the cumulative incidence of prostate cancer was 7.4% in the screening group versus 5.1% in the control group. There were 299 prostate cancer deaths in the screening group compared with 462 in the control group. The rate ratio for death from prostate cancer was 0.79 for the screening arm compared with the control arm (95% CI, 0.68-0.91; P=.001). The investigators concluded that the PSA-based screening program reduced mortality from prostate cancer by 21%. At the time of publication, the authors stated that 1055 men would need to be screened and 37 additional men would need to be treated over 11 years to prevent one prostate cancer death. Modeling the ERSPC data, however, Heijnsdijk et al 38 estimated that the number needed to screen was 98 and the number needed to treat was 5 to prevent one prostate cancer death.\nA recent report of 13-year follow-up of the ERSPC trial, with 7408 cases of prostate cancer di-agnosed in the screening arm and 6107 cases diagnosed in the control arm, confirmed these results. 39 The unadjusted rate ratio for death from prostate cancer was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.69-0.91) at 13 years. After adjusting for nonparticipation, the rate ratio of prostate cancer death was 0.73 (95% CI, 0.61-0.88). The authors reported that, for 781 men invited for screening or 27 additional prostate cancers detected, one prostate cancer death could be averted. Furthermore, another analysis of these 13-year data found that fewer men were diagnosed with metastatic disease in the screening arm (incidence rate ratio, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.52-0.70). 40 The apparent risk reduction was also confirmed in a recent analysis of the Rotterdam section of the ERSPC trial, in which prostate cancer-specific mortality was reduced by 32%. 41 This same group found that if one controlled for noncompliance and nonattendance, the risk of death due to prostate cancer can be reduced by up to 51%. 42 The G\u00f6teborg randomized population-based prostate cancer screening trial was initiated before and independently of the ERSPC, but some of its patients were reported as part of the ERSPC. 30 Twenty thousand men aged 50 to 64 years were randomized to either a screening group invited for PSA testing every 2 years or to a control group not invited. The study is ongoing, with men who have not reached the upper age limit invited for PSA testing. In men randomized to screening, 76% attended at least one test. PSA testing in the general population was very low at the beginning (3%), but increased over time.\nDuring a median follow-up of 14 years, 1138 men in the screening group and 718 in the control group were diagnosed with prostate cancer, resulting in a cumulative prostate cancer incidence of 12.7% in the screening group and 8.2% in the control group (hazard ratio [HR], 1.64; 95% CI, 1.50-1.80; P<.0001). The rate ratio for death from prostate cancer was 0.56 (95% CI, 0.39-0.82; P=.002) in the screening compared with the control group. Overall, 293 men needed to be screened and 12 needed to be diagnosed to prevent one prostate cancer death over 14 years. This study shows that prostate cancer screening is acceptable to the Swedish population and that prostate cancer mortality was reduced almost by half over 14 years. In addition, it should be noted that a cause-specific survival benefit was noted despite the fact that not all cancers were immediately treated. This result suggests that early detection combined with selective treatment based on risk can lower mortality rates without uniform treatment of all cancers.\nEighteen-year follow-up of the G\u00f6teborg trial was recently reported, with 1396 cases of prostate cancer in the screening arm and 962 cases in the control arm. 43 The reduction in absolute prostate cancerspecific mortality was 0.72 (95% CI, 0.50-0.94). The number needed to invite to prevent one death was 139 and the number needed to diagnose was 13.\nThere are several possible explanations for the more favorable results of the G\u00f6teborg trial compared to the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening (PLCO; see subsequent section) or ERSPC trials. First, the patients were younger and less likely to have incurable prostate cancer at first screening; second, there was less contamination of the control arm because PSA testing was uncommon in the Swedish population when the study began; third, a lower PSA threshold was used for recommending a biopsy; and finally, men were screened more frequently than ERSPC and for a longer period than PLCO. However, because more than half of the participants were included in the main analysis of ERSPC, the G\u00f6teborg trial should not be interpreted as a true independent confirmatory study. A recent analysis of the G\u00f6teborg trial showed that the risks of aggressive prostate cancer and prostate-cancer mortality became similar in the screening and control arms 9 years after the cessation of screening. 44 In a similar fashion, the Finnish Prostate Cancer Screening Trial, the largest component of ERSPC, reported a small, non-statistically significant reduction in prostate cancer-specific death after 12 years of follow-up. 45 "}, {"section_title": "PLCO Trial", "text": "The PLCO study randomized 76,685 men aged 55 to 74 years at 10 US study centers to annual screening (annual PSA for 6 years and DRE for 4 years) or usual care. 46 After 13 years of follow-up, the incidence rate ratio for the screening arm compared with the control arm was 1.12 (95% CI, 1.07-1.17). The investigators did not find a statistically significant difference between the disease-specific mortality rates of the screening and control groups (relative risk [RR], 1.09; 95% CI, 0.87-1.36).\nDespite the large sample size, this trial was flawed both by prescreening and the high contami-nation rate of 40% to 52% per year in the control group (ie, 74% of men in the usual care arm were screened at least once). The estimated mean number of screening PSAs (DREs) in the control arm was 2.7 (1.1) and 5.0 (3.5) in the screened arm. In addition, the biopsy rate for those with elevated serum PSA values was relatively low compared with the European trials. The PLCO trial thus really compared fixed screening versus \"opportunistic\" screening and, therefore, did not really test the hypothesis that screening with PSA is of value. However, it did show that yearly screening may be of limited value compared to less frequent testing. 47 In a subset analysis reported by Crawford et al, 48 a 44% decrease in the risk of prostate cancer-specific death was seen in men with no or minimal comorbidity assigned to screening compared to control, and the numbers needed to screen and treat to prevent one death were 723 and 5, respectively. This benefit was not found among men with one or more significant comorbidities. These results suggest that screening is more useful among men in good health due to the lack of competing cause for mortality. However, others suggest that such analysis is prone to major methodological errors. 49 "}, {"section_title": "Trial Limitations", "text": "In addition to the limitations of the PLCO trial noted previously, these randomized controlled trials (RCTs) also share at least 3 additional limitations. First, they did not address the potential benefit of screening in men with high-risk factors. For instance, fewer than 5% of PLCO participants were of African-American descent and only 7% reported a family history of prostate cancer. 29 Therefore, it is not known whether men at higher risk may benefit more from screening than those at lower risk. Second, many men in these studies underwent sextant prostate biopsies rather than extended core biopsies, the standard diagnostic technique used today. The ERSPC may have underestimated benefit due to advanced age at first PSA test (median above 60), low intensity of screening (largely every 4 years) and, perhaps, suboptimal treatment available in Europe in the 1990s compared to what is available today.\nThe reduction in prostate cancer mortality must be balanced against the adverse effects of treatment, emphasizing the importance of selective rather than universal treatment of men with prostate cancer identified by screening. 38 "}, {"section_title": "Practical Considerations of Testing Age at Which to Initiate Testing", "text": "Controversy exists as to the ideal age to begin screening for prostate cancer. Recent randomized trials looking at the impact of screening on prostate cancer mortality have focused primarily on men aged 55 to 69 years. The ERSPC and G\u00f6teborg trials reported decreased disease-specific mortality in men aged 55 to 69 and 50 to 64 years, respectively. These results support baseline PSA testing in men aged 50 to 55 years with the strongest evidence supporting testing at age 55.\nAs younger men were not included in these screening studies, baseline testing at earlier ages has not been evaluated in RCTs. However, observational evidence suggests that baseline testing of men in their 40s and early 50s may have value for future risk stratification, although some would describe the value as marginal. 50 A recent report clarified associations of age with the long-term risks of metastases. 52 In this study, the risk of prostate cancer death was strongly correlated with baseline PSA in men aged 45 to 49 years and 51 to 55 years; 44% of the deaths in the analytic cohort occurred in men in the highest tenth of the distribution of PSA, suggesting that there may be a strong rationale for baseline testing in men younger than age 55 years.\nTaken together, these results suggest that one could perform early, baseline testing and then determine the frequency of testing based on risk. Although many advocate earlier testing only in men thought to be at higher risk due to family history or race, as noted previously, a baseline serum PSA is a stronger predictor of the future risk of the disease compared with either of these risk factors.\nMost panel members favor informed testing beginning at age 45 years. Repeat testing at 1-to 2-year intervals is recommended for men who have a PSA value1.0 ng/mL or greater and at 2-to 4-year inter-vals for men with PSA less than1 ng/mL (also see \"Frequency of Testing,\" next section). This value is above the 75th percentile for younger men (<50 years). 53 The median PSA levels are 0.7 ng/mL and 0.9 ng/mL for ages 40 to 49 and ages 50 to 59, respectively."}, {"section_title": "54,55", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Frequency of Testing", "text": "Current guidelines and recent screening trials have employed varying strategies with regards to the frequency of prostate cancer screening. The ideal screening interval to maximize mortality reduction yet minimize overdiagnosis remains uncertain.\nA recent comparison of 2 centers involved in the ERSPC trial studied the impact of different screening intervals on the diagnosis of interval cancers in men aged 55 to 64 years. 56 The G\u00f6teborg arm randomized 4202 men to screening every 2 years, while the Rotterdam arm randomized 13,301 men to screening every 4 years with similar follow-up of 11 to 12 years. Compared with screening every 4 years, there was a significant, 43% reduction in the diagnosis of advanced prostate cancer (clinical stage >T3a, N1, or M1; PSA >20 ng/mL; Gleason >8 at biopsy) for screening every 2 years. However, there was also a 46% increase in the diagnosis of low-risk prostate cancer (clinical stage T1c, Gleason <6, and PSA <10 ng/mL at biopsy) for screening every 2 years.\nAnother study using micro-simulation models of prostate cancer incidence and mortality predicted that a strategy that utilizes biennial intervals in men with average PSA levels and longer screening intervals (every 5 years) for men with low PSA levels (below median for age by decade) allows a 2.27% risk of prostate cancer death compared to 2.86% from no screening. 57 In addition, compared with annual screening and using a biopsy threshold of 4.0 ng/ mL, the biennial strategy also projected a relatively lower over-diagnosis rate of 2.4% (vs 3.3% for annual screening), 59% reduction in total tests, and a 50% reduction in false-positive results. The biennial model was robust to sensitivity analyses, which varied the range of cancer incidence and survival attributed to screening.\nFew studies have addressed the effect of PSA levels on the interval of testing, but it appears that men with a very low PSA could safely extend the testing interval. In the Rotterdam section of the ER-SPC trial, men with a PSA less than 1 ng/mL had a very low risk for cancer at 4 and 8 years (0.23% and 0.49%). 58 Other studies have shown that PSA values at younger ages strongly predict the development of or death from prostate cancer. 55, 59 For example, in a Swedish case-control study of 1167 men, those aged 60 years with PSA concentrations of 1 ng/mL or lower had only a 0.5% risk of metastasis by age 85 and 0.2% risk of death from prostate cancer. 59 After considering these data, the panel concluded that tailoring screening intervals based on PSA levels might maximize survival advantage while decreasing the number of screenings and limiting over-diagnosis. The panel recommends repeat testing every 2 to 4 years if PSA is less than 1 ng/mL and every 1 to 2 years if PSA is 1 ng/mL or higher in men aged 45 to 75 years. The panel notes that a younger man on the higher end of PSA (eg, a 45-year-old man with PSA 0.9 ng/mL) might be screened in 2 years, whereas an older man with a lower PSA might be screened in 4 years. Clinical judgment should be used."}, {"section_title": "Age at Which to Discontinue Testing", "text": "Even more elusive than identifying the ideal age at which to start screening is determining the ideal age at which to discontinue screening for men with normal PSA levels. Panelists uniformly agreed that PSA testing should only be offered to men with a 10 or more year life expectancy. However, panelists did not agree as to when to discontinue routine testing in asymptomatic older men. Furthermore, estimates of life expectancy can be refined using several resources such as life insurance tables. [60] [61] [62] Physicians may not be accurate at estimating life expectancy and many tend to overvalue age and undervalue comorbidity. 63, 64 Since the previously cited RCTs (ESRPC, PLCO, and G\u00f6teborg) observed benefits to testing only in men aged up to 70 years, several panelists favored stopping testing at age 70 years. However, other data would suggest a benefit to screening beyond 70 years. A study of 4561 men who underwent radical prostatectomy found that men older than 70 years were more likely to have higher grade and stage of disease and worse survival compared with their younger counterparts. 65 Others have published similar findings. 66 To assess the appropriate ages for discontinuing screening, the previously cited microsimulation model 57 predicted that decreasing the stopping age from 74 to 69 years would lead to a 27% relative re-duction in the probability of life saved, but an almost 50% reduction in the probability of over-diagnosis. This latter finding reflects the fact that a large proportion of men older than 70 years have cancer that would be unlikely to diminish their life expectancy and that screening in this population would substantially increase rates of overdetection, while also recognizing the increased prevalence of higher-risk cases in this age that could benefit from earlier detection.\nThe microsimulation model also assessed a strategy of screening men up to age 74 years while simultaneously increasing the PSA threshold for biopsy based on age-dependent PSA levels (ie, increasing the threshold level for biopsy with increasing age). Compared with using a uniform cut-off of 4.0 ng/ mL, this strategy reduced the rate of over-diagnosis by one third while only slightly altering lives saved.\ntPSA at certain ages may predict future risk. Vickers et al 59 examined the relationship between baseline PSA at age 60 years and the future risk of prostate cancer death or metastases and found that those with PSA level below the median (<1 ng/mL) were unlikely to develop clinically significant prostate cancer (0.5% risk of metastases and 0.2% risk of prostate cancer death). Similarly, in a study of 849 men in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, no men aged 75 to 80 years with a PSA less than 3.0 ng/mL died of prostate cancer. 67 Moreover, the time to death or diagnosis of aggressive prostate cancer was longer in men with a PSA less than 3.0 ng/ mL versus those with a PSA greater than 3.0 ng/mL, suggesting that men 75 years or older with a PSA less than 3.0 ng/mL are unlikely to die or experience aggressive prostate cancer throughout their remaining life and may safely discontinue screening.\nIn summary, many possible strategies to reduce over-diagnosis in the older population exist. At this time, the panel supports screening in men until age 75, and then continuing screening only in very select patients (category 2B). The panel notes that although some men in this older age group present with high-risk disease, very few men older than age 75 years benefit from PSA screening."}, {"section_title": "Screening in High-Risk Populations", "text": "African-American men and men with a first-degree relative with prostate cancer (especially cancer found at a younger age) have a higher risk of developing prostate cancer.

[73] [74] [75] Whereas it is clear that African-American men and men with a family history of prostate cancer are at higher risk for prostate cancer incidence and mortality, the effects of intensive screening on cancer outcomes and on screening-related harms in these populations are not clear. Prostate cancer screening has been best studied in white men; data on screening in diverse and high-risk populations are lacking. In the PLCO trial, approximately 4.4% of the participants were African-American and 6.9% had a positive family history, but no subset analyses were performed. 29 In the ERSPC trial, no information on race or family history was reported. 31 In conclusion, African-American men and men with a family history of prostate cancer represent high-risk groups. However, the panel believes that current data are insufficient to inform the best strategy for prostate cancer screening in these populations and also note that a baseline PSA value is a stronger predictive factor than a positive family history or race. 76, 77 Therefore, although these individuals may require a higher level of vigilance and potentially different considerations when analyzing the results of screening tests, the panel does not give separate screening recommendations for these men at this time."}, {"section_title": "Prostate Cancer Risk in Genetic Syndromes", "text": "Some inherited syndromes increase the risk for prostate cancer.

[108] [109] [110] The goals of using MRI to inform the decision to perform biopsy include reducing the number of men undergoing biopsy, reducing the detection of indolent disease (and thus the risks of overdetection and overtreatment), and improving the detection of clinically significant disease through targeted biopsies. Current data, however, do not conclusively show that MRI achieves these goals.\nIn a prospective study of 223 biopsy-na\u00efve men with elevated PSA, all men had standard TRUS biopsies in addition to multiparametric MRI. 109 Participants with suspicious or equivocal lesions (PI-RADS 3-5) then underwent MRI-guided biopsy. TRUS biopsies detected 126 of 142 cases of cancer (88.7%) including 47 cases classified as low risk. The MRI-guided biopsies identified an additional 16 cases of intermediate/high-risk prostate cancer and led to the reclassification of 13 cases from low risk to intermediate/high risk. Thus, the addition of multiparametric MRI with targeted biopsies for suspicious or equivocal lesions to standard biopsy allowed the identification of clinically significant disease in an additional 13% of the study population. The authors also determined the effects of using multiparametric MRI to decide whether to biopsy. Not biopsying men with PI-RADS 1/2 would reduce the number of men requiring biopsy by 36%, reduce the identification of low-risk prostate cancer by 87%, and increase the yield of intermediate/high-risk tumors by 18%, but would have missed 15 intermediate/high-risk tumors (6.7% of study population).\nA single-center trial randomized 130 biopsyna\u00efve men to a control group that received TRUSguided random biopsy alone or to a group that received prebiopsy multiparametric MRI, TRUSguided random biopsy, and cognitive MRI/TRUS fusion targeted biopsy. 110 The primary outcome was not met, with similar rates of detection of prostate cancer (64% vs 57%; P=.5) and of clinically significant cancer (55% vs 45%; P=.8) in the 2 arms. Additional clinical trials are underway to assess the value of MRI imaging for diagnosis in the prebiopsy setting (eg, NCT02131207).\nAnother prospective study included 347 patients with findings suspicious for prostate cancer, many of whom had 1 or more previous negative biopsies. 108 All patients received a multiparametric MRI, and those with abnormal findings proceeded to MRI-TRUS fusion targeted biopsies. The outcome was defined as improved detection in targeted cores, with significantly more cancer detected in targeted cores than in systematic biopsies (30% vs 8.2%). About 12% of men without MRI-suspicious lesions were diagnosed with intermediate-risk tumors. In this study, the cancer detection rate was 51% in men with previous negative biopsies.\nIn a prospective cohort study of 1003 men undergoing both MRI-targeted and standard biopsy, Siddiqui et al 111 noted that the targeted biopsy strategy was associated with the detection of high-risk cancer and the decreased detection of low-risk cancer. Thus, the panel strongly believes that MRI alone should not be used to decide whether to perform biopsy and emphasizes that a negative MRI is not an indication to forego biopsy in a man with indications for first-time biopsy. All men with indications for biopsy should receive the standard 12-core TRUSguided biopsy regardless of MRI results. Based on the studies described previously, it is estimated that the use of MRI to exclude men from biopsies may lead to as many as 12% of significant cancers being missed, although the available data to date are not conclusive.\nThe panel also does not uniformly recommend that MRI-guided targeted biopsies be used in place of or in addition to standard 12-core TRUS biopsies in the initial biopsy setting. More information is needed in such a setting.

Several biomarker tests have been developed with the goals of refining patient selection for biopsies, decreasing unnecessary biopsies, and increasing the specificity of cancer detection, without missing a substantial number of higher-grade (Gleason \u22657) cancers. These tests may be especially useful in men with PSA levels between 3 and 10 ng/mL. Most often, these tests have been used in patients who have had one negative biopsy to determine if repeat biopsy is an appropriate consideration.\nThe panel recommends consideration of percent free PSA (%f PSA), 4Kscore test, and Prostate Health Index (phi) in patients with PSA levels greater than 3 ng/mL who have not yet had a biopsy. %f PSA, 4Kscore, phi, and prostate cancer gene 3 (PCA3) test may also be considered for men who have had at least one prior negative biopsy and are thought to be at higher risk.

However, the small number of deaths from prostate cancer (20) precludes definitive conclusions.\nIn two other studies of men with prostate cancer, 118, 119 very high PSAV (>2 ng/mL/y) during the year before diagnosis was associated with a greatly increased risk of death from the disease, but this is a much higher cutoff for PSAV than the one proposed by Carter et al.\nVickers et al, 120 however, have questioned the role of PSAV in tumor detection among men with low PSA levels. The analysis was performed on 5519 men undergoing biopsy regardless of indication in the control arm of the PCPT to explore the additional yield from a PSAV threshold of 0.35 ng/mL/ year. The main finding of this study was that PSAV did not significantly increase the predictive accuracy of high PSA levels or positive DRE and might substantially increase the number of men recommended for biopsy. However, these findings should be applied only to men similar to those studied in PCPT (\u226555 years of age; 96% Caucasian-American; 17% family history of prostate cancer; PSA values \u22643 at enrollment). 33 A recent report suggests that screening strategies that used PSAV at low PSA levels were more likely to suffer from overdiagnosis and falsepositive tests resulting in more harm relative to incremental lives saved. 57 Panelists disagree as to the value of PSAV alone as a criterion for considering biopsy when the PSA level is low (<2.0 ng/mL). Due to its potential capacity to identify tumors with lethal potential, most panelists agree that PSAV (PSAV \u22650.35 ng/mL/y) is only one criterion to consider when deciding whether to perform biopsy for men with low PSA levels. Panelists do not agree as to the threshold of PSAV that should prompt consideration of biopsy, but agree that high PSAV alone, at low PSA levels, does not mandate biopsy but rather should aid in the decision-making process. Other factors such as age, comorbidity, race, and family history also should be considered.\nIn a recently reported study of men pursuing a second biopsy after an initial negative biopsy, PSAV was an independent predictor of overall prostate cancer, intermediate, and high-grade cancer. 121 Panelists would also like to draw attention to the following caveats: the predictive value of PSAV can be influenced by PSA level 33, 118, 122 ; PSAV is not useful in patients with very high (>10 ng/mL) PSA values 123 ; PSAV measurements can be confounded by prostatitis, a condition that can cause dramatic and abrupt increases in PSA levels; 124 and fluctuations among measurements can occur as a result of either laboratory interassay variability related to the use of different commercially available sources or individual biologic variability.

Most immunoreactive PSA is bound to the protease inhibitor alpha-1-antichymotrypsin. Other immunoreactive PSA-protease inhibitor complexes, such as alpha-1-antitrypsin and protease C inhibitor, exist at such low serum concentrations that their clinical significance has not been determined. In addition, a large proportion of PSA is complexed with alpha-2-macroglobulin (AMG). Unfortunately, this PSA-AMG complex cannot be measured by conventional assays because of the shielding (or \"caging\") of PSA antigenic epitopes by AMG.\nMost clinical work investigating the use of the molecular forms of PSA for early detection of prostate cancer has focused on the percentage of PSA found circulating in the free or unbound form. Numerous studies have shown that the percentage of serum fPSA (%f PSA) is significantly lower in men who have prostate cancer compared with men who do not.\nThe FDA approved the use of %f PSA for the early detection of prostate cancer in men with PSA levels between 4 ng/mL and 10 ng/mL.

Targeted biopsies missed 2 cases of clinically significant cancer compared with 5 missed cases with standard biopsies.\nIn a prospective study, 583 patients (56% with prior negative biopsy) underwent multiparametric MRI. 169 All men received systematic 12-core biopsies, and men with lesions seen on MRI also received fusion-guided biopsies. Multivariate analysis revealed that a higher MRI suspicious score increased the likelihood of finding Gleason 7+ cancer by 3.3-fold (95% CI, 2.2-5.1; P<.0001).\nIn another prospective study, 1003 men with elevated PSA or abnormal DRE underwent multiparametric MRI to identify suspicious regions followed by targeted TRUS-MRI fusion biopsy and concurrent standard biopsy. 111 When possible, biopsy results were compared with whole-gland pathology after prostatectomy. Whereas the 2 biopsy approaches yielded similar numbers of prostate cancer cases, the targeted approach identified 30% more high-risk cancers (173 vs 122 cases, P<.001) and 17% fewer low-risk cancers (213 vs 258 cases, P<.001) compared with the standard approach. In the 170 men with whole-gland pathology, the predictive ability of targeted biopsy for differentiating low-from intermediate-or high-risk disease was superior to that of standard biopsy and the 2 approaches combined (AUC, 0.73 vs 0.59 vs 0.67, respectively; P<.05 for all comparisons). Saturation Biopsy Techniques: In saturation biopsies, 20 cores or more (usually [22] [23] [24] are collected systematically across the entire prostate in hopes of improving prostate cancer detection over that of a standard 12-core biopsy. Saturation biopsies can be performed via transrectal or transperineal approaches, the latter of which is often image-guided (see \"Targeted Biopsy Techniques,\" previous section). The approaches seem to have similar rates of cancer detection. 170 In fact, one study compared the approaches head-to-head and found similar cancer detection rates in the repeat biopsy setting (31.4% for transrectal vs 25.7% for transperineal; P=.3). 171 The transperineal approach may have a lower risk of infection, may allow for better saturation of the gland, and may be more acceptable to patients compared with the transrectal approach. 172 In fact, recent studies reported zero or near-zero rates of sepsis in men biopsied with the transperineal approach. [173] [174] [175] Another possible benefit of the transperineal over the transrectal approach is more accurate staging. 176 However, the transperineal approach may be associated with a higher rate of urinary retention. 172 The transrectal approach can be performed in the office.\nA study of transperineal template-guided mapping biopsy found detection rates of 55.5%, 41.7%, and 34.4% for men with 1, 2, and 3 or more previous negative biopsies, respectively. 177 Other groups have reported similar rates of detection using saturation biopsies in men with previous negative biopsies. 175, 178, 179 Compared with an extended biopsy approach (12-14 cores), one prospective, nonrandomized study found that transrectal saturation biopsy detected significantly more cancers in men with 1 previous negative biopsy (32.7% vs 24.9%; P=.0075). 180 The detection of insignificant cancer did not differ significantly between the groups (40.1% vs 32.6%; P=.2).\nBased on this emerging evidence, the panel believes that a saturation biopsy strategy can be considered for men with previous negative biopsies at very high risk ."}, {"section_title": "Risks of Biopsy", "text": "The problem of repeated biopsies is gaining attention in the PSA debate, due to increasing concerns about the risks of complications, particularly drug-resistant Escherichia coli infections. 181 The range of potential infectious complications includes urinary tract infection (UTI), epididymitis, orchitis, prostatitis, and sepsis. Other morbidities include rectal bleeding, hematuria, vasovagal episodes, fever, hematospermia, and dysuria. 182, 183 In an analysis of data from 17,472 men in the SEER database, prostate biopsy was associated with a 2.7-fold increased risk of 30-day hospitalization. 184 These investigators also reported that while the incidence of infectious complications after prostate biopsy has increased significantly in recent years, the incidence of noninfectious complications has remained relatively stable. These results are similar to those from a Canadian study of 75,190 men who were biopsied, in which the hospitalization rate increased from 1.0% in 1996 to 4.1% in 2005. 185 About 70% of all admissions were related to infections. A recent analysis of the PLCO trial, however, noted that biopsy complications were infrequent and that biopsy was not associated with a higher risk of mortality. 186 Fluoroquinolones, particularly ciprofloxacin, are used commonly as a prophylaxis for TRUS biopsy. Recent studies have reported that about half of postbiopsy infections are resistant to fluoroquinolone, many of which are also resistant to other antibiotics. 187, 188 Resistance is associated with prior prophylactic exposure to fluoroquinolone. 189, 190 Although these infections will respond to cephalosporins, measures are needed to prevent additional resistant strains. One strategy is to develop more stringent criteria for biopsy. Another proposed strategy is to selectively target antibiotic prophylaxis with prebiopsy rectal culture. 191 Up to 90% of men undergoing a prostate biopsy have reported some discomfort during the procedure. 192 Both topical lidocaine gel and an injectable nerve block have been shown to be safe and efficacious for reducing discomfort. 193, 194 Topical lidocaine was more efficacious in reducing pain during probe insertion, whereas periprostatic injection reduced pain during the biopsy itself. These minor anesthetic techniques greatly enhance the acceptability of the procedure, particularly with extended templates and saturation techniques, but should be considered in all patients. 195 For exceptional cases, such as for men with anal strictures or patients who have received inadequate pain block with a periprostatic injection, intravenous sedation or general anesthesia may be advantageous."}, {"section_title": "NCCN Recommendations General Considerations", "text": "The decision to participate in an early detection program for prostate cancer is complex for both the patient and physician. Important factors must be assessed when considering early detection of prostate cancer, including patient age, life expectancy, family history, race, and previous early detection test results (see \"Screening in High-Risk Populations,\" page 1546). Most importantly, the patient and physician need to understand the risks and benefits associated with the early detection and treatment of prostate cancer. Several general principles for early detection should be clearly understood before using the NCCN Guidelines:\n\u2022 No portion of these early detection guidelines is designed to replace an accurate history and complete physical examination conducted by a physician.\n\u2022 The general health, medical comorbidities, life expectancy, and preferences of the patient are paramount when recommending or designing an early detection program.\n\u2022 Prostate cancer risk factors, such as family history and race (ie, African-American men), should be considered before decisions are made concerning the initiation of an early detection program (see Screening in \"HighRisk Populations\").\n\u2022 Prostate cancer in its early stages has no identifiable symptoms. In advanced disease, symptoms may include urinary obstruction, prostatic bleeding, hematospermia, and bone pain. Although most men wishing to take part in early detection programs have no symptoms of prostate cancer, they may have mild to severe symptoms of lower urinary tract disease because of benign prostatic enlargement. Care should be taken to educate patients about the distinction between these diseases when discussing the risks and benefits associated with early detection.\n\u2022 A patient's history of prior testing, including DRE, PSA, PSA derivatives, and prostate biopsy, should be assessed when considering early detection.\n\u2022 A thorough discussion on the pros and cons of testing must be carried out between the physician and the potential participant as outlined in the algorithm. Patients should be informed that the purpose of screening is to find aggressive cancers, that screening often detects low-risk cancers, and that such lowrisk cancers may not need treatment but can be managed by active surveillance. Decision aids are available."}, {"section_title": "196", "text": "\u2022 The panel uniformly feels that these guidelines need to be linked to the NCCN Guidelines for Prostate Cancer (available at NCCN.org).\n\u2022 The panel recommends that baseline PSA testing should be offered to healthy, wellinformed men aged 45 to 75 years based on the results of RCTs. Baseline testing may be complemented by DRE.\n\u2022 The panel recommends frequency of testing be 2 to 4 years for men aged 45 to 75 years with serum PSA values below 1 ng/mL. For men with PSA at or exceeding 1.0 ng/mL, testing should occur at 1-to 2-year intervals.\n\u2022 The panel recommends that biopsy should be considered in those aged 45 to 75 years with a serum PSA greater than 3.0 ng/mL. However, most panel members agree that a decision to perform a biopsy should not be based on a PSA cut-point alone, but should incorporate other important clinical variables including age, family history, PSA kinetics, race, health status, and patient preference.\n\u2022 The panel recommends that PSA testing be considered only in very select patients after the age of 75 years (category 2B) and that indication for biopsy be carefully evaluated. Panel members uniformly discourage PSA testing in men unlikely to benefit from prostate cancer diagnosis based on age and/or comorbidity.\n\u2022 The panel recommends that consideration may be given to biomarkers that improve biopsy specificity such as %f PSA, 4Kscore, and phi before biopsy in men with serum PSA levels of greater than 3 ng/mL who desire more specificity.

Among men diagnosed with cancer on prostate biopsy, the panel does not recommend routine repeat biopsy, except in special circumstances, such as the suspicion that the patient harbors more aggressive cancer than was evident on the initial biopsy and the patient is otherwise a candidate for active surveillance as outlined in the treatment guidelines."}, {"section_title": "High-Grade Prostatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia:", "text": "Approximately 10% of patients undergoing biopsy will be found to have high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN). 197 Cytologically, the nuclear features of HGPIN resemble that of malignant tumors; however, the presence of a basal layer on the acini distinguishes this entity from cancer.\nExtended biopsy schemes have resulted in a dramatic decline in the prevalence of cancer detected from a repeat biopsy in patients with HGPIN detected from the initial biopsy. Although reports in the sextant biopsy era demonstrated cancer rates of approximately 50%, contemporary series using extended biopsy schemes report rates of approximately 10% to 20% and occasionally higher. [198] [199] [200] Interestingly, the rates of cancer with repeat biopsy in such patients seem to be little different than in those who undergo repeat biopsy based on other risk factors, such as age, family history, and PSA. In addition, most detected cancers are low grade. 201 If extended biopsies were used initially, only those at high risk for more aggressive cancer should undergo repeat biopsy. 202 It is recommended that those with multifocal HGPIN undergo repeat biopsy within 6 months, with increased sampling of the affected site and adjacent areas. Atypia, Suspicious For Cancer: Distinct from HG-PIN, in which a basal cell layer is present, atypia is characterized by small single-cell layer acini. Unlike HGPIN, which is a distinct pathologic diagnosis, atypia represents one of two possibilities: normal prostate tissue distorted by artifact or prostate can-cer that does not meet the histologic criteria for a diagnosis of prostate cancer. Because so few glands are present on the biopsy specimen, an unequivocal diagnosis of cancer cannot be established.\nEven in the era of extended biopsy schemes, the prevalence of cancer detected from a repeat biopsy in patients with atypia detected from the initial biopsy is quite high: 50% or more, with the most likely area of cancer detection residing in the prostate area demonstrating atypia from the initial biopsy. 204, 205 Therefore, the panel recommends a repeat extended biopsy scheme within 6 months of an initial atypia diagnosis, with additional cores obtained from the region demonstrating atypia. If no cancer is found on the repeat biopsy, close follow-up with PSA (with consideration of complementary DRE) is recommended. Benign Results: If a biopsy returns as negative for cancer, the panel recommends 2 options for followup: repeat PSA and DRE in 6 months with biopsy based on results or %f PSA, 4Kscore, phi, or PCA3 testing to inform the decision about performing a repeat biopsy. As discussed in detail previously, multiparametric MRI, targeted biopsies, or saturation biopsy techniques may also be considered in the evaluation of such patients."}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "Since the early 1990s, many variants of the tPSA assay have been introduced in attempts to increase the sensitivity of screening programs or cancer detection while maintaining specificity (elimination of unnecessary biopsies). These NCCN Guidelines recommend a method by which individuals and their physicians can use these new techniques rationally for the early detection of prostate cancer. These guidelines are not designed to provide an argument for the use of population screening programs for prostate cancer. Rather, they are meant to provide a vehicle by which early detection efforts can be practiced in an evidence-based, systematic fashion in patients who choose to participate in such programs. Whether to treat a patient on diagnosis is beyond the scope of these guidelines (see the NCCN Guidelines for Prostate Cancer, available at NCCN.org).\nThese NCCN Guidelines for Prostate Cancer Early Detection incorporate many recently validated findings if and when they occur. The panel will reexamine the clinical utility of new modalities annually, and the guidelines will be modified accordingly. In addition, future iterations of these guidelines may incorporate new serum markers currently undergoing clinical investigation.\nThe goal of NCCN and the Panel in updating these algorithms is to assist men and clinicians in choosing a program of early detection for prostate cancer and in making decisions regarding the need for prostate biopsy. Any clinician who uses these guidelines is expected to exercise independent medical judgment in the context of the individual clinical circumstances to determine the patient's need for prostate biopsy. These guidelines will continue to evolve as the field of prostate cancer advances."}]
