A composite score of five cognitive tests during this interval showed reduced performance for surgical patients with mild cognitive impairment. Conclusions: Elderly subjects after surgery experienced an increased rate of brain atrophy during the initial evaluation interval, a time associated with enhanced risk for postoperative cognitive dysfunction. Although there was no difference in atrophy rate by diagnosis, subjects with mild cognitive impairment suffered greater subsequent cognitive effects.\nT HERE have been numerous reports of impairment of cognitive performance following surgery. [1] [2] [3] [4] However, it is not yet known which patients are at risk for post operative cognitive dysfunction (POCD).\nPOCD occurs in approximately 10% of elderly patients after noncardiac surgery. 1 The presence of POCD is determined by the comparison of preoperative and postoperative cognitive performance using a battery of neuropsychometric tests that assess memory and executive function. [2] [3] A goal of the present study was to examine short-term longitudinal changes in brain volume and in cognition in elderly patients pre-and postsurgery in order to improve our understanding of the risk of POCD. 5 Despite numerous reports describing cognitive decline after surgery, proponents have met with considerable criticism because the population considered most at risk for POCD is subject to various other cognitive risks, including progressive dementias, vascular insults, and the nonspecific impact of aging; it is also difficult to devise an appropriate control for the surgical groups. 6 It has recently been suggested that the baseline cognitive diagnosis, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), may also identify additional patient risk for postsurgical cognitive impairment. 7 MCI is a clinical term that includes individuals with impairment in one or more cognitive domains (typically various forms of memory) greater than would be expected for a person's age, but who are otherwise functionally intact and capable of living independently. This suggests the need for an independent, object measure of POCD risk.\nQuantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is particularly useful in observing longitudinal brain changes in patients with degenerative diseases. This includes monitoring of Alzheimer disease (AD) progression in subjects both with MCI, 8 -9 and in cognitively normal elderly. 10 However, it has not been applied to monitoring effects related to POCD. MRI may avoid some of the confounds associated with cognitive testing (currently the standard for tracking POCD), while also obtaining significant results with fewer patients. 11 Quantitative MRI can be obtained with good accuracy for both between and within subject measurements, and can be reduced to continuous value parameters (e.g., volume) for individual brain structures. Such images from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database were used to examine the interaction of aging, severity group (normal, or NL, MCI, and AD), and surgery on the geriatric brain.

ADNI was launched in 2003 by the National Institute on Aging, the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering, the Food and Drug Administration, private pharmaceutical companies, and nonprofit organizations, as a $60 million, 5-yr public/private partnership. The Principal Investigator of this initiative is Michael W. Weiner, M.D., Veterans Administration Medical Center and University of California -San Francisco. ADNI is the result of efforts of many coinvestigators from a broad range of academic institutions and private corporations, and subjects have been recruited from more than 50 sites across the United States and Canada. The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial MRI, positron emission tomography, and other biologic markers, as well as clinical and neuropsychological assessment, can be combined to measure the progression of MCI and early AD. Determination of sensitive and specific markers for very early AD progression is intended to aid researchers and clinicians in the development of new treatments and to monitor their effectiveness. This would also have the effect of lessening the time and cost of clinical trials. The initial goal of ADNI was to recruit 800 adults, ages 55 to 90, to participate in the research: approximately 200 cognitively normal older individuals to be followed for 3 yr, 400 people with MCI to be followed for 3 yr, and 200 people with early AD to be followed for 2 yr. \u00a7 \u00a7 Regulatory. The collection of data by ADNI was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of all participating institutions. Informed written consent was obtained from all participants. The New York University Medical Center Institutional Review Board takes the position that anonymous data from another institution (as in this case) is \"not human subjects research.\" Subject Selection. Subject ages were between 55 and 90 (inclusive). Subjects must have been willing and able to complete all study tests at baseline and for at least 3 yr, including two follow-up exams. Exclusion/inclusion criteria applied to patients in the ADNI study also applied to subjects in this analysis. Those with MRI scans with evidence of infection, infarction, other focal lesions, or multiple lacunes in critical memory structures were excluded. In addition, the following illnesses/injuries constituted exclusions: Huntington's disease, brain tumor, normal pressure hydrocephalus, progressive supranuclear palsy, seizure disorder, subdural hema-toma, multiple sclerosis, major depression or bipolar disorder, alcohol abuse, and head trauma followed by neurologic defaults or structural brain abnormalities. Other significant systemic illnesses or unstable medical conditions that would interfere with protocol compliance were also cause for exclusion.\nThe initial ADNI sample was 835 subjects with data available in the \"Adverse Events/Hospitalizations-Log.\" Putative surgical patients were selected by searching the comment fields for positive key words (e.g., surgery, thoracotomy, operative, among others), and excluded based on negative key words (e.g., cataract, lasik), which pointed to no surgery or minor surgery. A group of 226 putative surgical subjects were thus identified. We screened manually for confirmation of surgery and date, resulting in a cohort of 119 confirmed surgical patients. We further required that each surgical patient had a presurgical and postsurgical MRI, and that the follow-up (postsurgical) MRI was within 5 to 9 months of the baseline presurgical MRI. That screened group included 66 subjects. At baseline, all demented subjects were excluded so the final surgical cohort contained 41 subjects (17 stable NL, 24 MCI). A subset of 31 surgical subjects (15 stable NL, 16 stable MCI) had a second MRI follow-up evaluation, defining a second intervisit interval.\nThe nonsurgery group of 341 patients included subjects who were not flagged for key words and who did not have minor surgery. The nonsurgical controls and surgical subjects were then matched utilizing a model that estimated the propensity of study participants to have surgery. This \"propensity matching\" procedure was based on the following available variables: age, sex, education, Apolipoprotein E status, months to follow-up 1, race, mini-mental state examination, Geriatric Depression Scale score, and Hachinski (vascular risk). The surgery subjects (n \u03ed 41) were then matched 1:3 to the current nonsurgical cohort (n \u03ed 341) using the control subject's propensity to have surgery based on these variables. The propensity population for the nonsurgery subjects was n \u03ed 123 (51 stable NL, 72 MCI). For the nonsurgery group, the first two MRIs that were within 5 and 9 months of each other were used as the baseline and follow-up.\nThus in summation, we compared changes in regional brain volume for three visits (evaluations) that defined two intervisit intervals for a surgical cohort (n \u03ed 41) and a propensity-matched nonsurgical control cohort (n \u03ed 123). The first interval for the surgical cohort contained the surgical date. MRI and Image Analysis. We chose to examine whole brain gray matter (GM), whole brain white matter (WM), and lateral ventricle (LV) volumes as general measures of structural integrity. The hippocampal volume was examined as a specific memory-related region with relevance to AD. The GM volume does not include hippocampus.

Furthermore, MCI subjects would presumably have less cognitive reserve and compensatory factors working to stabilize cognition. 25 Since MCI subjects are already at higher risk for conversion to AD, care must be taken in attributing their outcome to POCD alone.\nNumerous studies have reported a relationship between surgery and cognitive impairment. 2, [27] [28] However, caution should be used in considering causality, because both surgery and cognitive impairment share common features, e.g., age dependence and the involvement of inflammatory processes. Furthermore, developing a trial protocol randomized to surgery is difficult from a regulatory standpoint. 6 In some instances, the presumed impact of surgery was the impact of the precipitating illness itself. 29 Yet various factors commonly associated with surgery (e.g., increased peripheral blood levels of interleukin-6 30 and chronic pain 31 ) have been shown to cause GM atrophy in the absence of aging or surgery. Behavioral changes related to surgery (potentially reflecting both therapeutic impact, elimination of chronic pain, increased mobility, among others, and recuperative requirements, such as decreased mobility) might interact with atrophy by way of neural plasticity-mediated effects on GM/WM density. [32] [33] Neural plasticity may be relevant to our finding of potential recovery from atrophy during the second follow-up interval, where we no longer find atrophy on average. However, it is important to keep in mind that recovery from atrophy doesn't necessarily lead to recovery of function.\nIn this study, surgeries by type and incidence include: joint/limb repair (12; hip, shoulder, knee, wrist, ankle, foot), joint replacement (7; hip, shoulder, knee), tumor resection (7; breast, prostate, skin, pituitary, thyroid), gynecological (3; hysterectomy), ENT (3; ear, nose and throat), urological (2), vascular (2), spinal (2), abdominal (1; hernia), and ophthalmologic (1; excluding cataract). There is no reason to assume that these patients were spared the normal inflammatory or behavioral impact experienced due to the pre-or postsurgical clinical condition.

During the onset of AD, one of the best studied of the neurodegenerative illnesses, changes in vulnerable limbic and heteromodal regions can serve as diagnostic indicators. Atrophy occurs before symptoms and becomes more pronounced as symptoms progress. 16,10,18 -20 Because our sample contains both NL and MCI patients of advanced age, we assume a varied distribution of baseline atrophy.\nLongitudinal MRI studies of cortical anatomy can be performed with great reproducibility and sensitivity. 21 Comparing normal subjects and those with cognitive impairment showed significant changes. 10, 19 For example, cortical thinning was reported to average 5.2% greater in AD subjects than older controls 19 ; e.g., rostral medial temporal cortex had the largest thinning (0.4 mm; 14% vs. older controls) with thinning in excess of 0.2 mm in the inferior temporal, temporal pole, inferior parietal, and superior frontal regions (8.1-11.6% change vs. older controls). The primary visual cortex, seldom involved in AD, showed no significant thinning (0.03 mm, 2.2%).\nWe chose to examine cortical GM as a general measure, and hippocampus as a specific region of interest. Hippocampus is known to atrophy with age, over almost the entire course of AD progression, 22 and in response to environmental stressors. Since some areas of the cortex may not be affected by either baseline atrophy or surgical stress, global GM changes will not fully reflect the size of the changes in the most involved areas of the cortex. Both hippocampal atrophy [23] [24] and MCI diagnosis 9 predict increased risk of pro- Surgery and Brain Atrophy gression to AD. However, it is not known whether hippocampus atrophy induced by environmental stressors (e.g., surgery) incorporates the same mechanisms and/or risk of progression as the atrophy studied during incipient AD. In terms of understanding age-and dementia-related progression, it seems prudent to assume a multiple factor framework 25 such that atrophy is only one of several causal factors driving progression of cognitive symptoms.\nFrom figure 4 , it is evident that the atrophy associated with surgery is a nontrivial (20 -40%) portion of that encountered in going between the severity levels (NL, MCI, MCI-AD). Based on the time patients remain at each severity level, or on the average atrophy rates during progression, 16 and compared with our reported atrophy rates, atrophy for surgical patients would seem to have advanced by 1 to 2 yr more than controls. From figures 3A and B, we can see that the changes in the composite cognitive parameter as a function of hippocampal atrophy are larger in relation to surgery, than in relation to changed severity group levels (diagnosis)."}, {"section_title": "Surgery, POCD, and Comorbidity", "text": "A complication in any longitudinal study is risk of mortality/ morbidity. 26 Subjects with diagnoses ranking high on the list of comorbidity risk, as well as diagnosed AD or evidence for cognitive progression (leading to a diagnostic severity change), were all excluded from this study at the time of ADNI enrollment. This should imply a relatively homogeneous group at the time of enrollment. However, despite the enrollment restrictions, some 15% of the initial enrollees wound up requiring surgery within 3 yr of joining the study.\nAttempts have been made to classify surgeries in terms of postoperative cognitive risks. One might assume that type and duration of surgery, incidence of complications, coronary-pulmonary bypass, hypotension, and blood loss would be predictors of POCD risk. However, the only POCD risk factors proven significant in a recent report were: years of education, age, and history of cerebral vascular accident with no residual damage. 27 The limited availability of detailed surgical information for patients in our study, as well as the uncertain weighting of risk factors, discourages us from using a more complex stratification. However, we have found a distinct suggestion of MCI subject vulnerability to cognitive impairment postsurgery, both in the higher relative risk of a POCD-like change and the significant change in the composite cognitive parameter during the first evaluation interval. Although the increased rate of hippocampal atrophy, for example, is not different for MCI and NL patients, there already is considerable baseline atrophy for the MCI subjects. Thus surgery-associated atrophy may be more problematic for MCI subjects, because of their cumulative atrophy at the Fig. 4 .

For example, the fact that the risk of POCD varies inversely with years of education is generally attributed to cognitive reserve, 27 whereby an individual with minor cortical atrophy is spared the symptoms of cognitive impairment by a postulated cortical redundancy, presumed a function of increased education. 25 Such redundancy is difficult to measure a priori, and comparable education by no means guarantees comparable levels of reserve.\nAnother possible source of homogeneity in the relationship between atrophy and cognition is variation in baseline atrophy in specific GM regions with known involvement in AD progression, e.g., medial temporal lobe. GM baseline atrophy can be because of various configurations of change in subregions. 22, 34 Furthermore, as hypothesized in the dissociation hypothesis, [35] [36] atrophy of GM can lead to atrophy of enervating WM, and atrophy at any site can alter behavior in an entire network. 37 Thus GM and WM atrophy occur with complex timing, 22 not synchronized yet not independent.\nAmong the mechanistic questions posed by the atrophy measurement are whether: 1) we are seeing a simple speeding up of ongoing progression encountered at baseline; 2) there is a selective, and perhaps synergistic, interaction of surgical stressors with other forms of atrophy; 3) surgery-related effects are independent of those associated with normal progression of dementia; or whether, 4) attainment of threshold levels of atrophy induce irreversible changes in other risk factors. In any case, there is no reason to believe that predicting potential effects of surgery are any less complex than defining risks for progressive dementias themselves."}, {"section_title": "Long-term Effects", "text": "An obvious question is whether atrophy associated with surgery may alter progression of dementia.\nIt is difficult to explore long-term effects from a shortterm study. For example, extending our analysis from 6 months to 1 yr reduced the available surgery cohort from 41 to 31. Extensions to even longer time periods would lead to a further loss of sample size and power.\nAnalysis of the second follow-up interval did not show a statistically significant continuation of atrophy. The components of change in the second interval include some subjects with improved volume (recovery from atrophy), some with no change, and some with continued atrophy. Since a fairly small increase in risk of progression is important from a public health standpoint, we would only have to show that a small proportion of the subjects with continuing atrophy had increased risk of conversion to AD for an important epidemiologic result. However, a surgically related increase in the annual MCI to AD conversion rate in our study from 16.5% to 20% would only result in a single extra AD patient, a change unlikely to be resolved.\nHowever, although the surgically related effect on rate of cortical atrophy may be temporary, transient changes in the postoperative period may have long-term relevance. Consider, for example, a recent epidemiologic study 38 reporting a significant increase in mortality in patients diagnosed with POCD at 3 months, an effect not evident until approximately 2 yr postsurgery. POCD at even 1 week after surgery was statistically associated 8 yr later with early exit from the labor force, and the need for social support services. 38 "}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "In our cohort of elderly subjects, those having undergone surgery experienced a more pronounced atrophy in hippocampal and GM volume than did nonsurgical (control) Surgery and Brain Atrophy subjects over a similar time frame (5-9 months). We were not able, in exploring the second follow-up time interval, to find a persistent effect of surgery on rate of atrophy. There are individual subjects who continue to atrophy at an enhanced rate, but we cannot detect effects on their outcome within the limited time frame of the data using standard survival analysis; and we cannot rule out atrophy related to progressive dementia.\nThe cognitive change found from our composite measure was also limited to the first time interval, which is consistent with the early and transient occurrence of POCD (3 months) often reported in the literature. That significant cognitive changes accompanying atrophy were seen in the MCI surgery subjects suggests that their baseline atrophy may put them at increased risk. 5 Thus our study more readily supports the notion of a transient POCD event associated with surgical patients, than it contributes to the analysis of risk factors leading to dementia progression. These questions suggest the need for a more comprehensive examination of surgery, cognition, and atrophy."}]
