[{"section_title": "", "text": "This report summarizes the current statistical programs of the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), including its major publications and plans for future work. It updates the descriptions of long-standing data collections such as the Common Core of Data, the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, and the National Assessment of Educational Progress. This edition also focuses on some of the new and innovative work of the NCES, such as the Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMMS) and the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten (ECLS-K) cohort. An introduction describes NCES data collection efforts, and information on NCES programs is grouped into the following sections: (1) NCES Center-wide programs and services; (2) elementary and secondary education; (3) postsecondary and adult education; (4) educational assessment; (5) national longitudinal studies; (6) international statistics; (7) vocational education; (8) libraries; and (9) general publications of the NCES.  In order to fulfill the National Center for Educations Statistics (NCES) mission, \"...to collect, analyze, and disseminate statistics and other information related to education in the United States and in other nations...,\" NCES must strive to develop high-quality, customer-driven products that are readily available to all education stakeholders. NCES is engaged in a set of agency-wide activities that are intended to help attain these goals. First, with respect to high quality, NCES' reputation as a statistical agency is dependent on the integrity and the relevance of the information it produces. Second, with respect to customer-driven products, the value of NCES to the education community is contingent upon a full understanding of the data needs and interests of our customers. Third, with respect to availability, NCES' success in making as much information available as possible hinges upon the effective use of technological advances."}, {"section_title": "Statistics", "text": "Standards and Technical Review NCES has its own set of statistical standards that provide the guiding principles for data collection, analysis, and reporting of education data. NCES staff and contractors use these standards in an ongoing effort to ensure the development of high quality education data. From study design to final analysis, NCES products are subjected to a rigorous technical review process that involves statistical and subject-matter experts from NCES and the broader education community. During study design and data collection, NCES uses a combination of internal work groups, external technical review groups, and contractors to design and collect data to meet the needs of the education community. Data collection and processing frequently involves the collaboration of NCES staff and several contractors configured in a manner designed to ensure checks and balances on quality control. Analyses are conducted only after analysis plans are developed and reviewed. Finally, the report review process usually involves a series of reviews by subject-matter and technical colleagues, culminating in a formal review by a combination of internal and external reviewers. NCES continually strives to increase the efficiency of the full review process, while at the same time maintaining high standards. At the present time, work is under way to identify emerging issues and to update the 1992 statistical standards that are currently in use. Over the past several years, NCES has also participated in an agency-wide effort to evaluate existing quality control procedures and to develop and effect new ones."}, {"section_title": "Quality Control", "text": "In the fall of 1996, the Commissioner convened the Task Force on Quality Systems to study NCES quality control procedures, with the goal of identifying ways to improve the current procedures. The first phase of this task force included a review of current procedures and resulted in a set of 9 findings and 20 recommendations. These findings and recommendations focused on five areas: spread existing skills within NCES, improve documentation and communication, improve uses of computer systems for checking key results, improve the review process, and improve contract procedures. I 11 NCES is using Quality Improvements Teams to develop action plans for the recommendations. A number of projects are under way. For example, NCES' guidelines for tabular presentations are being updated, and a report that documents analytic techniques applied in NCES publications is in development. In addition, checklists are being drafted which will promote improved communications between analysts and programmers, to increase consistency in the review of electronic data products, and to document table production."}, {"section_title": "Methodology", "text": "In an effort to document NCES data collection procedures, the Statistical Standards Program is sponsoring and monitoring the development of a handbook of NCES data collections. The handbook will document key aspects of the design, collection, and processing of NCES surveys. A related report that summarizes the imputation procedures in NCES data collections is also under development. In a complementary project, the Statistical Standards Program conducted a review of the response rates in each NCES data collection. The results of this review will also be published in an NCES report. Periodically, statistical questions emerge that break new ground for NCES. The Statistical Standards Program consults and advises in these situations, and in some instances a panel of experts is used to consult on or review specific problems. Recent examples of this process include reviews of the procedures used in developing a statistical link between the results from the Third International Mathematics and Science Study and the National Assessment of Educational Progress; of the response probability decision rules that are applied in NCES assessments; and of the NCES policies and procedures for analyzing data with low response rates."}, {"section_title": "Research", "text": "The Statistical Standards Program initiated research in two areas. The Education Statistics Services Institute has been commissioned to extend some earlier developmental work they conducted on total survey error for NCES. And, in a collaborative project with faculty at the University of Michigan, NCES staff will examine methodological and analytic issues involved in using longitudinal data."}, {"section_title": "Confidentiality", "text": "Much of the data that NCES collects is provided by individual respondentsstudents, parents, teachers, and administrators. NCES is required by law to develop and enforce standards designed to protect the confidentiality of individually identifiable respondents. This requirement includes the collection, reporting, and publication of data. The Statistical Standards Program has two major functions in this area. First, the program leads the Disclosure Review Board Team, comprised of members from each NCES division, representatives of the Statistical Standards Program, and a representative from the Census Bureau. This team reviews disclosure risk analyses conducted on NCES data files to ensure that data released on public use data files do not place the identity of any individual respondents in jeopardy. The second major activity in this area is designed to make data that fail the Disclosure Review Board test available to researchers on a restricted basis. (Similar restricted-use data licenses, a concept pioneered by NCES, are now being used in other federal statistical agencies.) These licenses provide external researchers access to individually identifiable NCES data covered under federal statutes and regulations by subjecting authorized users to the laws, regulations, and penalties that apply to the NCES use of confidential data. Under the license agreement, authorized users are subject to unannounced inspection visits. The Statistical Standards Program monitors the licensing process and the inspections. Based on an analysis of inspection reports program staff developed a set of recommendations for improved quality control and increased customer service. As a result, annual reminder letters are being used to update information on licensees and authorized users. In addition, an automated system is being developed for the field inspections. This will facilitate immediate corrections of potential security problems and will allow NCES staff to monitor licensees more effectively. "}, {"section_title": "Customer Service", "text": "NCES is committed to providing a range of customer-driven products that are tailored to the needs of different members of the education community. In an effort to meet this goal, a variety of data release formats are used on a regular basis. Detailed data are made available in a variety of formatsfrom published statistical compendia and online data almanacs, to micro-data files that are available for secondary analysis. NCES reports range from detailed technical methodological and analytic reports that provide an in-depth analysis of a particular topic or issue to Statistical Briefs and Issue Briefs that provide a short focused analysis of a specific topic. In a new effort to make NCES data analyses available to a broader audience, NCES is launching the Education Statistics Quarterly, a periodical that will include findings from all NCES reports on a quarterly basis. Currently, all NCES publications are available online at the NCES Web site (http://nces.ed.gov). NCES also continues to explore new and innovative ways to use the World Wide Web to make education information available to as many data users as possible. (For more information, please see subsequent NCES \"Technology\" and \"World Wide Web\" descriptions in this chapter.)"}, {"section_title": "Customer Service Survey", "text": "The NCES Commissioner established a Customer Service Team to ensure that sufficient effort is devoted to the continual monitoring of our customer's information needs. As part of an ongoing effort to better understand the data needs and interests of the education community, this team conducts a biennial customer service survey. The purpose of the survey is to assess customer satisfaction with NCES products and services, and to identify areas that need improvement. The last customer survey was conducted in 1997. The next survey is planned for the spring of 1999. The survey's respondents do not include all of NCES' customers; instead, the survey focuses on specific customer groups. The 1997 survey targeted two large groups of current and potential users: federal, state, and local policymakers, as well as academic researchers. The response rate to the 1997 survey was 84 percent. The survey results indicate strong satisfaction with NCES and its products. However, awareness of NCES does vary considerably 0 between respondent groups and particular products. NCES' customers use data for many purposes. Three main uses cited in the survey were: general information, research and analysis, and planning. The data also suggest that the more experienced the user, the higher the level of satisfaction. The survey does indicate less satisfaction with the timeliness of NCES publications and data files, and the need for NCES to increase awareness of agency products and services. These are areas that NCES managers are seeking to improve."}, {"section_title": "Outreach Partnerships", "text": "In an effort to improve dissemination and increase the use of NCES' education statistics, NCES has developed \"partnerships\" with external organizations whose members are either interested in education data or could become potential users. With NCES acting as a data \"broker,\" these new collaborative relationships provide an excellent means for expanding NCES' customer base and learning more about the needs of specific data users. And by making use of existing communication channels in other organizations, NCES is also able to make contact with potential customers. Collaborative activities include: providing information on NCES products in association newsletters and online services; developing links to Web sites; providing training on NCES databases and other activities; developing individual workshops for specific data users; and identifying and assessing data needs. This two-way interaction with outside networks increases the utility of NCES products and services by more accurately reflecting the needs of various constituencies."}, {"section_title": "Practitioner's Web Page", "text": "Through focus groups and customer surveys, NCES has determined that local education practitioners (e.g., educators, administrators, counselors, librarians, and parents) are not adequately aware of NCES products and services. As a result, NCES decided to develop a Web page that is targeted to the data needs of these groups. This new online service, called \"The K-12 Practitioners' Circle\" (http://nces.ed.gov/practitioners), presents education data in a user-friendly manner and provides links to a wide range of NCES publications and other relevant resources. While alerting users to NCES findings on both continuing and emerging education issues, it also provides information on relevant research studies, and other practical resource materials that local practitioners would find useful. The new Web page will be updated regularly to respond to pressing education issues and NCES will be encouraging feedback from its users.

The NCES training officer plans and coordinates these seminars on an as-needed basis. For example, in fiscal year 1998, there were seminars on: variance estimation; imputation of missing data; statistical significance testing; multiple regression analysis; logistic regression analysis; path analysis; hierarchical linear modeling; and special software such as SUDAAN and Wesvar PC-computer programs for handling survey data from complex sample designs. In addition to statistical methods, seminars also cover topics such as contract management and emerging educational priorities, issues, and policies. Although these seminars are tailored to the needs of NCES staff, they are open to the general public. Any interested staff members from other government agencies, professional associations, private companies, or other organizations may attend. NCES also offers training seminars for external data users to promote and facilitate the effective use of NCES databases such as the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988, the National Household Education Survey, the Schools and Staffing Survey, the Third International Mathematics and Science Study, the National Assessment of Educational Progress, and the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System. These data users include faculty members and graduate students in higher education institutions, as well as researchers and data analysts at state and local education agencies, professional associations, and other federal agencies. Seminars are usually offered each summer and are about 4 to 5 days long. During these seminars, participants learn how to access and analyze NCES data. Participants also review certain statistical topics such as sample design, variance estimation, imputation, and sampling weights. To participate in these seminars, browse the NCES Web site (http://nces.ed.gov) for seminar announcements and specifications for applying. Instructors for both in-house and external-data-users seminars are usually NCES' staff members who have extensive knowledge and experience in the given subject matter. Sometimes nationally known experts in pertinent fields are invited to give lectures. An announcement for each seminar will be posted on the NCES Web site (http://nces."}, {"section_title": "ed.gov).", "text": "For more information on Training, contact: Samuel S.

Advances in technology are also helping to position NCES for future operations and new methods of data collection, analysis, and dissemination. Programs and individual projects are designed to be consistent with an overall vision of expanding access to NCES data. Eventually, computer and telecommunications technologies will enable all members of the educational communitylearners, parents, teachers, and administrators, as well as observers and policymakersto come directly to NCES for information. Technology tools developed by NCES will help reduce the burdens of data collection, enhance accuracy and timeliness of analysis, and increase the ease of access to education statistics. A variety of plans are being implemented to fully incorporate current and emerging technologies into the NCES working environment, and to provide both internal and external customers with timely education statistics information in useful formats. Internal activities include acquiring and supporting up-to-date desktop hardware and software to facilitate statistical analyses, developing integrated software solutions for program management, and leveraging local and wide area network resources to share information. NCES currently provides access to its databases through a variety of mechanisms. These include the dissemination of data via diskettes and CD-ROMs, or through NCES' Web site. However, developments in Web-related software and data warehousing provide new opportunities to broaden and strengthen NCES' data offerings. A new initiative has been undertaken to construct a data warehouse that will ultimately contain most of NCES' databases. Several developments will enhance the utility of the Web site by speeding the access time and expanding the material available. Planned improvements in indices, subject categorizations, and database search utilities will improve the ability of users to get answers to questions. Software now being developed will also allow users to conduct online analyses with the Common Core of Data (elementary-secondary) and the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System databases. Current activities to enhance electronic access to NCES data include: Disseminating of products and services via the Internet and World Wide Web; Improving data administration and developing of a data warehouse resource; Developing and supporting of improved CD-ROM products for NCES databases; Fostering increased capabilities of data suppliers and users to submit and retrieve NCES data electronically through the Internet; and Expanding customer options for retrieving timely education data."}, {"section_title": "World Wide Web", "text": "An important component of the NCES Technology Program is the NCES Web site (http://nces.ed.gov). NCES constituents with access to the Internet can also tap a rich collection of education-related information at the U.S. Department of Education's (ED) World Wide Web site (hup://www.ed.gov). Other data sets too large for Web access and restricted-use survey data sets are made available on CD-ROMs direct from NCES or other organizations. NCES' Web site is its largest and most visible dissemination platform. Since the site's inception in May 1996, it has grown to nearly 30,000 pages. Current usage statistics indicate that approximately 140,000 user sessions and almost 1,400,000 page views take place on a monthly basis. NCES has a full-time Webmaster and a Web team consisting of liaisons from all divisions and the Commissioner's office. The Web site is becoming NCES' primary mode of communication with its varied constituencies."}, {"section_title": "24", "text": "Features of the NCES Web site include: An example of one of the search services available through the site is the NCES National Public School Locator (http://nces.ed.gov/ccdweb/schoollschool.asp). This feature allows customers to locate a school based on name, location, state, or other similar variables. The National Public School Locator includes statistics on individual school characteristics such as teacher counts, number of students, student-teacher ratio, and school membership by race-ethnicity. The NCES Web site also provides a direct link to the extensive collection of education-related materials at the U.S. is currently piloting the collection of sample survey data from individual respondents over the Internet. This effort involves breaking new territory in education data collection in the application of data encryption methods necessary for the protection of confidential data. As NCES surveys are periodically redesigned, the Technology Program will utilize the Internet to provide a comprehensive online environment for the collection, editing, tabulation, and publication of survey data. The first survey to be redesigned in this manner is the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS). The first online collection for IPEDS will be conducted in summer 1999. An online collection and processing environment will allow NCES to increase timeliness and quality of data, while minimizing the reporting burden placed upon our respondents. Online Internet survey operations will also provide for uniformity and consistency across NCES surveys and provide a solid foundation to support the NCES data warehousing initiative."}, {"section_title": "NCES Data Warehouse", "text": "The concept of providing an integrated collection of related data from multiple sources in order to respond to complex inquiries has been around for some time. Data warehouses are the next logical step in the expansion of automated information systems. These warehouses include more data and enable more powerful and flexible analysis. With education statistics, analyses have often been constructed with specific survey data. Cross-survey or time-trend analyses frequently required long and expensive data massaging and custom analysis. A data warehouse of education information will provide a rich, yet convenient resource for in-depth research. It will also provide a mechanism to respond to simple, but specific queries such as: 'how do enrollment changes in my school district compare with those in other similar districts in another state?' The objective is to build a new education information source within the Web site that will eventually provide integrated access to survey and linked survey data, metadata, survey instruments and documentation, and ultimately reports and other published analysis. The warehouse will be distinguished from existing NCES products in three respects: it will be exclusively Internet based; it will contain a growing repository of linked data from different surveys; and it will feature tools that enable customers to easily find, extract, and analyze NCES data directly. The NCES Data Warehouse will be designed to expand and improve as more data are uploaded and Internet tools become more powerful. From a customer perspective, the major benefit of the data warehouse will be more extensive Internet access to NCES survey data and documentation."}, {"section_title": "26", "text": "Technology esearch In addition to incorporating current technologies into its programs and operations, NCES helps sponsor a broad agenda to extend technological capabilities. This is a complementary effort in support of the National Science Foundation's \"Digital Government Initiative.\" NCES is currently working on three research topics: The use of relational database technologies to natively support statistical functions such as standard error calculations for complex sample survey data; The development of clustered index algorithms for spatial databases; and The development of statistical analysis techniques for time-event indexed video databases.

This archive is a work in progress that is designed to include a vast range of national and international data on education collected primarily by NCES from the 1960s to the present. These databases are available at no charge, in ASCII flat file format which can be used with statistical processing software such as SAS and SPSS. The goal of the archive is to share information about education with researchers, academics, policymakers, service providers, and other customers. NCES currently maintains over 500 national data collections relating to education. The data are collected from elementary and secondary schools, colleges, and universities, as well as from elementary, secondary, and postsecondary students and teachers. Each data collection contains an abstract, codebook, and one or more data files for research use. No statistical tables or printed reports are included. This archive makes this wealth of data publicly available and readily accessible. Additional NCES databases, both new and old, will be routinely added to the archive. This archiving project will preserve and enrich the research resources of NCES, as well as produce an archive of data sets that can be used effectively in the era of Internet and the World Wide Web. It will also significantly enhance documentation of NCES data to make them more userfriendly. The publicly available data can be accessed and downloaded directly from the ICPSR Web site (http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/index.html). .19"}, {"section_title": "Data Uses", "text": "The statistics collected from state education agencies and from other elementary-secondary surveys are used extensively by people outside of NCES. They are used for testimony before congressional committees, for planning in various federal executive departments, and for projects developed by professional organizations. They are used by state executive and legislative staff, by state and local education agencies, and by associations of local school systems. Other users are colleges, universities, other education research facilities, various businesses that work with educational institutions, and the media (by reporting on educational issues and events). Federal, state, and local governments make numerous requests for data. For example, representatives often request data on the demographic characteristics of school districts in their states, federal agencies request data on numbers of teachers and pupils by school level and type; state governments request data on high school dropouts and teacher attrition rates; and local governments request analyses of teacher demographics. In addition to federal, state, and local governmental requests for elementary and secondary information, foreign governments also request data on trends in American public schools. The media often need a great deal of data on elementary and secondary education for their reporting. For example, the media has used analyses of first-time teachers in the United States, characteristics of public schools, dropout rates, test scores, and urban school trends in their reporting. Colleges and universities request copies of data tapes and CD-ROMs of many of the elementary and secondary surveys. Some items of interest for postsecondary researchers have been teacher qualifications in mathematics and science, poverty status of schools and school districts, free lunch eligibility of students, dropout rates and high school completions, class size, crime and violence, and persistence and attainment. ;1. 2 9 Business organizations, including marketing and survey firms, use the mailing lists of schools and districts to do their research. Also, parents use data on elementary and secondary schools and school districts (such as per pupil expenditures and class size) when they are in the process of moving their families to a new location.\nThe NCES postsecondary education data systems provide information such as trends in enrollment and degree completion; patterns of expenditures and revenues of institutions; patterns of student financial aid; workload of faculty; and the relationship between educational experience and labor market outcomes. These data are used to describe the condition of postsecondary education and to monitor changes. Federal program staff have used IPEDS and student aid survey data to address policy issues on financial aid programs. Policymakers at the state and institutional level have used IPEDS data for planning purposes. Government commissions have used these data to monitor compliance with federal legislation. Thousands of requests for information, based on the IPEDS and other postsecondary programs, are received by NCES each year. Those requesting data fall roughly into seven categories: Federal agencies; State agencies; National and regional education associations; Individual institutions; The media; The business community; and The general public.\nThe National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972 (NLS-72) data have been widely used for investigating educational policy issues. For example, in the early 1980s a congressional committee turned to these data to develop a model for estimating the costs of tuition tax credits. More recently, capsule descriptions of this cohort have been produced and attrition rates from college have been studied, as have transitions from high school and college into the workplace. Postsecondary attainment, access, and financial aid studies have all used NLS-72. The enlarged scope of HS&B provided even more data than NLS-72 for examining a wide variety of education policy issues. Like NLS-72, HS&B produced a number of capsule descriptions of high school students. Additionally, HS&B data have been used to study the achievement of Hispanic students, discipline and order in high schools, economic issues such as students working while in school, comparisons of public and private schools, the continuity of early employment of high school sophomores, and course-taking patterns of American high school students. Because similar items were used in HS&B, NELS:88, and NLS-72 it is possible to compare the high school seniors of 1980, 1982, and 1992 with those of 1972. The National Assessment of Vocational Education (NAVE) used the data from the HS&B study in several of their reports. For example, NAVE used HS&B data for studies which attempted to measure high school curricular experiences as they relate to vocational education, course enrollment patterns, and student financial aid as it relates to postsecondary vocational education. The NELS:88 completed the third followup data collection in 1994. The fourth followup is planned for the year 2000. Data from this survey are being used to study transition patterns of eighthgrade students as they move through school (e.g., moving from public to private school, dropping out of school, and moving into high school and college). Other research issues being addressed include: Students' academic growth over time and the family, community, and classroom factors that promote or inhibit such growth; The tracking of course-taking patterns during high school; The educational outcomes and generational status among Asian and Hispanic eighth-graders; At-risk students' successful navigation of the pipeline to college enrollment and the process of dropping out of school; The role of the school in helping the disadvantaged; The school experiences and academic performance of language minority students; The process of attracting students to the study of mathematics and science; and The transition to postsecondary education and the workforce.\nNCES receives many requests for information about education in other countries, such as school achievement levels, school completion rates, school expenditure levels, and higher education enrollment rates. Policymakers, such as chief state school officers, governors, and local school officials, also want to know the average level of achievement in other countries. Most requests are for data concerning highly developed countries (e.g., Australia, Canada, England, France, Germany, and Japan). This particular concern relates to maintaining a leading position in the world economy. However, interest is not just limited to how well the education systems do in preparing youth for participation in the labor force. NCES also provides international data on instructional practices. These data are gathered through two vehicles: survey data gathered at the same time assessment data are collected, and videotape data. Both vehicles allow researchers to examine and exemplify instructional practices around the world. Data from these international activities appear prominently in numerous publications produced not only in the United States but also by international organizations. The OECD publication, Education at a Glance, relies heavily on data gathered through NCES. United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization reports on literacy have begun to follow the conventions developed by the International Adult Literacy Study, which NCES helped to underwrite.\nExcept for the survey of school library media centers, each of the library surveys is a universe survey, and the data files resulting from these surveys can be used as a frame to develop samples of libraries for additional surveys by NCES, other agencies, or researchers. The data resulting from these surveys provide important information on monetary, human, and educational resources and services. Library data also provides policymakers at the national, state, and local levels with information on populations being served by libraries, particularly public libraries and, perhaps more importantly, populations that are not served or that are inadequately served by libraries. Some of the analytical questions concerning libraries in the United States that can be addressed by the library survey data include: adequacy of staffing levels and size and content of the collections in libraries, populations served by the libraries, the number of items per year that libraries circulate, how library expenditures relate to total institutional expenditures, and the extent of public library services to children and adults. The six library surveys provide the only current, national, descriptive data on the status of libraries. They are used by professional associations; local practitioners; and federal, state, and local officials for planning, evaluation, and making policy. These data are also available to researchers and educators to analyze the state of the art of librarianship and to improve its practice. In addition to the periodic surveys of libraries, NCES has carried out some sample surveys related to public librariesboth to assess the feasibility of incorporating certain items into its universe surveys, and to obtain information that addresses specific issues of the moment that are too temporal to be incorporated into a routine universe survey. For example, in 1993, NCES conducted a survey of public library services to children and young adults using the Fast Response Survey System (FRSS). Several items on the extent of children's services were added the Public Libraries Survey in 1995, based on the results of this FRSS survey. NCES also collected information from households "}, {"section_title": "Studies Common Core of Data", "text": "The Common Core of Data (CCD) is NCES' primary database on elementary and secondary public education in the United States. The annual CCD is a comprehensive national statistical database of all public elementary and secondary schools and school districts that contains comparable data across all states. The objectives of the CCD are twofold. First, it is designed to provide an official listing of public elementary and secondary schools and school districts in the nation that can be used to select samples for other NCES surveys, and to provide directory information for a variety of users. Second, the CCD provides basic information and descriptive statistics on public elementary and secondary schools, students, and staff. The data sets within CCD can be used separately or in conjunction with one another to provide information on many topics of interest. For example, they can be used to analyze differences in expenditures for education across large and small, or urban, suburban, and rural school districts. The CCD produces dropout rates for different types of school districts and tracks changes over time. It also measures changes in the racial-ethnic distribution of students in public schools. The school universe allows users to look at characteristics such as pupil-teacher ratios at various instructional levels, or to use the addresses in the school directory found on NCES' Web site (http://nces.ed.gov) to request school records for transferring students. In addition an annually produced CD-ROM links all of the CCD data, financial and non-fiscal, with school district-level data from the 1990 decennial Census in an easy-to-use format. The CCD is an important resource for policymakers at the state and local levels. The CCD provides basic statistics on schools, school districts, and states. Some examples of descriptive statistics available from CCD are: student enrollment by race-ethnicity, number and types of schools, revenues and expenditures of school districts, and number of high school completers and dropouts. The CCD is also used to choose samples for other NCES databases."}, {"section_title": "DESIGN", "text": "The CCD survey collects data about all public elementary and secondary schools, all local education agencies, and all state education agencies throughout the United States. The CCD contains three categories of information: general descriptive information on schools and school districts, data on students and staff, and fiscal data. The general descriptive information includes name, address, phone number, and type of locale (e.g., rural or urban). The data on students and staff include expenditures by function (instruction, support services, and noninstruction) and subfunction (e.g., school administration). This survey also includes capital outlay and debt service expenditures. School District Finance SurveyDetailed data by school district, including revenues by source expenditures by function and subfunction, and enrollment. These data are collected annually through the Bureau of Census' F-33, Survey of Local Governments. Data are collected from all districts in years ending in \"2\" and \"7\" and from a large sample in remaining years. Early EstimatesState summary data on numbers of students; teachers and high school graduates; and revenues and expenditures. These estimates are released during the school year in which they are collected.\nThe sample design for SASS is a stratified probability sample in which schools are selected first, and then within schools, the principal is surveyed, as well as a sample of teachers. The SASS sample has been designed to support the following types of estimates and comparisons: national and state estimates for public schools and teachers; national estimates for private schools and teachers by religious affiliation or type of school; and national comparisons of elementary, secondary, and combined schools and teachers. The teacher sample also supports comparisons of new versus experienced teachers, and teachers by teaching assignment field. In 1993-94, three new components were included in SASS: a student records questionnaire, a school library-media center questionnaire, and a library-media center questionnaire. Of these three, only the library-media center component will be continued in future collections. Also in 1993-94, an oversample of schools having more than 19.5 percent American Indian students and all Bureau of Indian Affairs schools were included in the SASS sample, thus providing the most comprehensive data set on Indian education in the nation. -34 26\nTwo questionnaires comprise the TFS: the Teacher Followup Survey Questionnaire for Former Teachers, and the Teacher Followup Survey Questionnaire for Continuing Teachers (those who remained in the same school as well as those who moved to another school). These questionnaires ask teachers about their current status, occupational changes and plans, reasons for staying in (or leaving) teaching, and attitudes about the teaching profession. The TFS was first conducted in the 1988-89 school year with a sample from the 1987-88 SASS of about 2,500 teachers who had left teaching and 5,000 who were still in teaching. The sample size is approximately the same for every cycle of the TFS. The TFS was also conducted in 1991-92 and again in 1994-95, each a followup to the SASS sample of the previous year. The next TFS will be conducted in the 2000-2001 school year.\nThe target population for the universe survey consists of all private schools in the United States that meet NCES criteria of a school (e.g., private school is an institution which provides instruction for any of grades K-12, has one or more teachers to give instruction, Is not administered by a public agency, and is not operated in a private home). The survey universe is composed of schools identified from a variety of sources. The main source is a list frame, initially developed for the 1989-90 PSS. The list is updated regularly matching it with lists provided by nationwide private school associations, state departments of education, and other national guides and sources which list private schools. The other source is an area frame search conducted by the Bureau of the Census. CowoNENTs 1997-98 Private School SurveySurvey of private schools to ascertain: level of school; religious orientation or other affiliation; size of school; length of school year and school day; total enrollment (K-12); race-ethnicity of students; whether a school is coeducational and the gender of students in single sex schools; number of high school graduates; number of teachers; program emphasis; whether school offers a kindergarten program; and whether a school has a library or library media center. The National Household Education Survey (NHES) is the first general purpose survey conducted by NCES to collect education data through a household-based survey. Historically, NCES has collected data from teachers, students, and schools through school-based surveys, and from administrative records data through surveys of school districts and state education agencies. With a household-based survey, the NHES has the potential to address many issues in education that have not been addressed previously by NCES data collection activities. Full-scale NHES collections have been conducted in the springs of 1991, 1993, 1995, and 1996. Topical components covered in these collections have been: Early Childhood Education/Early Childhood Program Participation (NHES:91 and NHES:95), Adult Education (NHES:91 and NHES:95), School Readiness (NHES:93), School Safety and Discipline (NHES:93), Parent and Family Involvement in Education (NHES:96), Civic Involvement (NHES:96), and Household and Public Library Use (NHES:96). The NHES will be conducted again in the spring of 1999 and on a biennial basis thereafter. The NHES provides data on a wide range of current education issues. The issues vary by component and are provided in the component descriptions above.\nThe NHES is designed as a mechanism for collecting detailed information on educational issues from a relatively large and targeted sample of households in a timely fashion. Households are selected using random-digit-dialing methods and data are collected using computer-assisted telephone interviewing procedures. The sample for the NEES is drawn from the civilian population in households having a telephone in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. In each previous MIES, between 44,000 and 64,000 households were screened and individuals within households who met predetermined criteria were sampled for more detailed or extended interviews. The data are weighted to permit estimates of the entire population. The NHES survey for a given year typically consists of a screener questionnaire which collects household composition and demographic data and extended interviews on two substantive components addressing education-related topics. Generally, between 10,000 and 15,000 interviews have been obtained for each component. One of the goals of the NHES is to produce reliable estimates of the characteristics of children and adult educational experiences for the total targeted populations and for domains defined by race and ethnicity. Estimates by race and ethnicity are of great interest, especially for monitoring education trends over time. Therefore, the NHES design samples minorities at a higher rate in order to increase the reliability of estimates for these groups. A design feature implemented in the NHES:96 is the collection of demographic and educational information on members of all households, rather than just those households potentially eligible for a topical component. In addition, this expanded screening feature includes a brief set of questions on the use of public libraries. The total household sample size is large enough to produce state estimates for these brief topical questions. Throughout its history, the NHES has collected data in ways that permit estimates to be tracked across time. This includes repeating topical components on a rotating basis in order to provide comparative data across survey years. In addition, each administration of the NHES has benefited from experiences with previous cycles, resulting in enhancements to the survey procedures and content. Thus, while the survey affords the opportunity for tracking phenomenon across time, it is dynamic in addressing new issues and including conceptual and methodological refinements. During the spring of 1991, NCES fielded an NHES on Early Childhood Education and Adult Education. Approximately 60,000 households were screened to identify a sample of about 14,000 children, 3-to 8-year-olds. The parents of these children were interviewed. At the same time, about 12,500 adult household members were sampled and questioned about their participation in adult education. (See the \"National Household Education Survey (Adult Component)\" description in chapter 4,) In the spring of 1993, the two topical components covered were School Readiness and School Safety and Discipline. Altogether, nearly 64,000 households were screened. In the School Readiness component, parents of approximately 11,000 children, 3-to 7-year-olds were asked about their children's experiences. In the School Safety and Discipline component, parents of about 12,500 children in grades 3 through 12 were interviewed about their children's school environment. A sample of about 6,500 students in grades 6 through 12 were also interviewed about safety and discipline in their schools. The components addressed in the spring of 1995, Early Childhood Program Participation and Adult Education, were similar to those addressed in 1991. Altogether, about 44,000 households were screened. In the Early Childhood Program Participation component, about 14,000 parents of children from birth through third grade were interviewed. For the Adult Education component, about 19,500 civilian adults were interviewed. (Again, see the \"National Household Education Survey [Adult Component] in chapter 4.) The two larger topical components covered in the spring of 1996 were Parent and Family Involvement in Education and Civic Involvement. The population of interest for the Parent and Family Involvement in Education component were children from age 3 through 12th grade. Nearly 21,000 parents were interviewed. The populations of interest for the Civic Involvement component were youth in 6th through 12th grades, parents of youth in 6th through 12th grades, and civilian adults age 18 and older. Interviews were obtained with about 8,000 youth, about 9,000 parents of youth, and about 2,000 adults. The screener component of the 1996 survey also addressed household public library use. Adults in almost 55,000 households were interviewed. The sample was selected to support state level estimates of household public library use.\nThe School Crime Supplement is conducted from January through June of the collection year in all NVCS sample households. Within these households, eligible respondents for the School Crime Supplement are household members between the ages of 12 and 19 who attended school at any time in the previous 6 months. The school had to be one which would advance them toward the receipt of a high school diploma. These persons are administered the supplemental questions only after the entire NCVS interview is completed. More than 10,000 interviews of youth are obtained in the School Crime Supplement. The same rotation scheme employed for the NCVS survey design is used for the School Crime Supplement. The sample of households is divided into groups or rotations. One rotation group enters the sample every 6 months and the corresponding rotation group from a previous sample is phased out. Households remain in the sample for 3 years, and each household is interviewed once every 6 months during that time. A rotation scheme is used in order to reduce the burden on respondents that could result if they were permanently in the sample. Households in the sample for the first time are in the incoming rotation. These households are interviewed in person. Households in the sample for their second through sixth interviews are in the continuing rotations. These households are interviewed by telephone. The exception is households in the sample for their fifth NCVS interview. These households are interviewed in person to reestablish personal contact. In 1995, about 30 percent of the households were interviewed by telephone from a centralized dialing facility using computer-assisted telephone interviewing techniques. Other 4 6 38 telephone interviews were conducted by the same interviewer who conducted the personal interviews. The Census Bureau conducts the data collection. Reports released by the Bureau of Justice Statistics on NCES data can be found on the Internet (http://ww w. oj p. usdo. gov/bj s).\nWithin IPEDS, postsecondary education is defined as \"the provision of a formal instructional program whose curriculum is designed primarily for students who are beyond the compulsory age for high school. This includes programs whose purpose is academic, vocational, and continuing professional education, and excludes adult basic education programs.\" Organizations that provide instructional programs as described in the definition above are considered institutions within the IPEDS universe if their primary purpose is the provision of postsecondary education. The size of the institution, diversity of program offerings, levels of awards, degree or certification curricula, type of accreditation, or other distinguishing criteria are considered characteristics of particular institutions. These criteria are not used to determine which institutions are included in or excluded from the IPEDS universe.\nThe NHES is designed as a mechanism for collecting detailed information on educational issues from a relatively large and targeted sample of households in a timely fashion. Households are selected using random-digit-dialing methods, and data are collected using computer-assisted telephone interviewing procedures. The sample for the NHES is drawn from the civilian population in households with a telephone in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. In each previous NHES, between 44,000 and 64,000 households were screened. Individuals with households who met predetermined criteria were sampled for more detailed or extended interviews. The data are weighted to permit estimates of the entire population. The NHES survey for a given year typically consists of a screener questionnaire which collects household composition and demographic data, and extended interviews on two substantive components addressing educationrelated topics. Generally, between 10,000 and 15,000 interviews have been obtained for each substantive component. One of the goals of the NHES is to produce reliable estimates of the characteristics of children and adult educational experiences for the total targeted populations and for domains defined by race-ethnicity. Estimates by race and ethnicity are of great interestespecially for monitoring education trends over time. Therefore, the NHES sample design samples minorities at a higher rate in order to increase the reliability of estimates for these groups. A design feature implemented in the NHES:96 is the collection of demographic and educational information on members of all households, rather than just those households potentially eligible for a topical component. In addition, this expanded screening feature includes a brief set of questions on household use of public libraries. The total household sample size is large enough to produce state estimates for these brief topical questions. Throughout its history, the NILES has collected data in ways that permit estimates to be tracked across time. This includes repeating topical components on a rotating basis in order to provide comparative data across survey years. In addition, each administration of the NHES has benefited from experiences with previous cycles, resulting in enhancements to survey procedures and content. Thus, while the survey affords the opportunity for tracking phenomenon across time, it is dynamic in addressing new issues and including conceptual and methodological refinements. During the spring of 1991, NCES fielded an NHES on Early Childhood Education and Adult Education. Approximately 60,000 households were screened to identify a sample of about 14,000 children, 3 years to 8 years old. The parents of these children were interviewed (see the \"National Households Education Survey\" description in chapter 3). At the same time, about 12,500 civilian adult household members were sampled and questioned about their participation in adult education. The components addressed in the spring of 1995, Early Childhood Program Participation and Adult Education, were similar to those addressed in 1991. Altogether, about 44,000 households were screened. In the Early Childhood Program Participation component, about 14,000 parents of children from birth through third grade were interviewed (see chapter 3). For the Adult Education component, about 19,500 civilian adults were interviewed.\nWith the increased use of technology, the design for the NPSAS sample has changed over the years. The 1995-96 design no longer involves an initial sample of geographic areas, and institutions within geographic areas. To be eligible for inclusion in the institutional sample, an institution must satisfy the following conditions: Offer an education program designed for persons who have complete secondary education; Offer an academic, occupational, or a vocational program; Offer access to persons other than those employed by the institution; Offer more than just correspondence courses; Offer at least one program lasting 3 months or longer; and Be located in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, or Puerto Rico. Additional information on the sample design for each NPSAS is described in the Methodology Report for each cycle. NPSAS data come from multiple sources, including institutional records and student and parent interviews. Detailed data concerning participation in student financial aid programs are extracted from the Department of Education's financial aid application system, the National Student Loan Data System, and institutional records. In 1986-87, family circumstances, demographic data, and plans and aspirations were collected using student and parent questionnaires. Beginning with the 1989-90 NPSAS, student and parent data were collected using a computer-assisted telephone interview. The 1986-87 NPSAS sampled students enrolled in the fall of 1986. Beginning with the 1989-90 NPSAS, students enrolled at any time during the year were eligible for the study. This design change provided the data necessary to estimate full-year financial aid awards. Beginning with the 1989-90 survey, NPSAS includes a longitudinal component and collects baseline data for a specified cohort of students. Students who began their postsecondary education during 1989-90 were interviewed in 1992, and again in 1994, to examine such issues as per'sistence and effects of financial aid on subsequent enrollment. Students who graduated with a baccaiaureate degree during 1992-93 were surveyed again in 1994, and again in 1997, to examine issues such as the transition from college to work and access to graduate school. Students who began in 1995-96 were followed in 1998. These longitudinal surveys, known as the Beginning Postsecondary Student Longitudinal Study and the Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study, are described more thoroughly in chapter 6. NPSAS covers a number of topics of interest to policymakers, educators, and researchers. For example, NPSAS analyzes the participation of students in financial aid programs. The goal is to identify institutional, student, family, and other characteristics related to program participation. Special population enrollment in postsecondary education is also analyzed. These populations include students with disabilities, racial-ethnic minorities, students taking remedial-developmental courses, students from families with low incomes, and older students. Another component of NPSAS is the study of the distribution of students by major field of study. Major fields of particular interest include mathematics, science, and engineering, as well as teacher preparation and health studies.\nThe first cycle of NSOPF was conducted by NCES with support from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) in 1987-88 (NSOPF-88) with a sample of 480 colleges and universities, over 3,000 department chairpersons, and over 11,000 instructional faculty. The second cycle of NSOPF was conducted by NCES with support from NEH and the National Science Foundation in 1992-93 (NSOPF-93). NSOPF-93 was limited to surveys of institutions and faculty, but with a substantially expanded sample of 974 colleges, and universities, and 31,354 faculty and instructional staff. NSOPF-88 was limited to faculty and staff who had some instructional responsibilities (e.g., teaching one or more courses for credit, supervising thesis or dissertation committees, and individualized instruction) while NSOPF-93 included these individuals, as well as faculty who had no instructional responsibilities (e.g., those engaged exclusively in research, administration, or public service). Faculty status was determined by each institution. A two-stage stratified random sample design was used for both studies. The first-stage sampling frame consisted of a subset of postsecondary institutions drawn from the Integration Postsecondary Education Data System universe. The subset of institutions included all nonproprietary U.S. postsecondary institutions that grant a 2 year or higher degree, and whose accreditation at the higher education level is recognized by the U.S. Department of Education. A modified Carnegie classification was used to stratify institutions by type and control. The secondstage sampling frame consisted of a subset of faculty and instructional staff drawn from lists of faculty and instructional staff provided by the institutions selected in the first-stage sampling. This subset of faculty and instructional staff were surveyed by mail with computer-assisted telephone interviewing nonresponse followup. Both studies gathered information regarding the backgrounds, responsibilities, workloads, salaries, benefits, attitudes, and future plans of both full-and part-time faculties. In addition, \nSurvey forms are mailed to graduate deans each May for distribution to individuals receiving their doctorates between July 1 and June 30 of the next year. The data are collected, edited, and published by the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). By the end of the summer, the NAS publishes general survey results in a summary report and in a four-page flyer. NAS also provides detailed tabulations to each sponsoring agency.\nPEQIS employs a standing sample (panel) of approximately 1,500 postsecondary education institutions and a panel of 51 state higher education agencies. PEQIS is designed to conduct brief surveys of postsecondary institutions or state higher education agencies on topics of national importance. Surveys are generally limited to two or three pages of questions, with a response burden of about 30 minutes per respondent. Most PEQIS institutional surveys use a previously recruited, nationally-representative panel of institutions. The sampling frame for the PEQIS panel recruited in 1992, was constructed from the 1990-91 Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) Institutional Characteristics file. The PEQIS frame developed in 1992, included 2-year and 4-year (including graduate-level) institutions (both institutions of higher education and other postsecondary institutions), and less-than-2-year institutions of higher education located in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. The PEQIS sampling frame was stratified by instructional level (4year, 2-year, less-than-2-year), control (public, private nonprofit, and private for-profit), highest level of offering (doctor'sfirst professional, master's, bachelor's, and less than bachelor's), total enrollment, and status as either an institution of higher education or other postsecondary institution. Within each of the strata, institutions were sorted by region (Northeast, Southeast, Central, and West), whether the institution had a relatively high minority enrollment, and whether the institution had research expenditures exceeding $1 million. Each institution in the PEQIS panel was asked to identify a campus representative to serve as survey coordinator. The campus representative facilitates data collection by identifying the appropriate respondent for each survey and forwarding the questionnaire to that person. October SupplementBasic annual school enrollment for preschool, elementary-secondary and postsecondary students; and educational background information needed to produce dropout estimates on an annual basis. Computer Use (1984, 1989, 1993, and 1997)Availability of computers at school, home, and work; reasons for and frequency of computer use at school, home and work; and availability of the Internet at school, home and work. Private School Tuition (1979, 1985, 1988, 1991, 1994, and 1997 nongovernmental providers and users of education data, NPEC s mission is \"To identify and communicate ongoing and emerging issues germane to postsecondary education; and to promote the quality, comparability, and utility of postsecondary data and information that support policy development, implementation, and evaluation.\" NPEC consists of a Council with nearly 140 members representing agencies, organizations, and associations from all sectors of the postsecondary community including public, nonprofit, and proprietary institutions; state postsecondary agencies; state and regional organizations; national postsecondary associations; and federal offices with an interest in postsecondary education. Members are nominated to the Council by state agencies and postsecondary associations. Members serve a 3-year term, with one-third of the membership rotating each year. Project activities include an annual meeting of the Council and meetings of working groups and subcommittees of the NPEC Steering Committee. These meetings help the Council reach its goals and manage its membership and communication activities. The Steering Committee generally approves three to five new projects per year. In the first 3 years of the Council, members participated in a Delphi study to identify the future trends affecting postsecondary education, and held two invitational policy panels to discuss the data implications of definitions of access and technologymediated instruction. In addition, NPEC projects are addressing better coordination of data collection and reporting, good practices in data collection and reporting, exchanges of student unit record data, and the utility and adequacy of student outcomes measures for policymakers. NPEC has established a Web site within the NCES site. It has produced three papers and two videos from its working group efforts. Other informational items produced include a brochure about the Cooperative, a quarterly newsletter, and a communications packet for members. issues and related data needs. Additionally, the network maintains a library service providing information about state and federal postsecondary education data collections. There is also a personnel exchange service that provides funds for staff of state higher education agencies to meet each other and share technical assistance information regarding their data collection and dissemination efforts. The Network Director visits state higher agencies, attends postsecondary association meetings, and makes recommendations regarding new and developing issues in need of national data to inform education policyrnakers. \nThree separate assessments are conducted: trend NAEP, main national NAEP, and main state NAEP. In the trend NAEP, students are periodically assessed in science, mathematics, reading, and writing. Nationally representative samples of students have been assessed in science, mathematics, and reading at ages 9, 13, and 17 since the early 1970s. Students have been assessed in writing at grades 4, 8, and 11 since 1984. To measure trends accurately, assessment items (mostly multiple choice) and procedures have remained unchanged since the first assessment in each subject. Recent trend assessments were conducted in 1994 and 1996, and the next will take place in 1999. About 30,000 students took part in the 1996 trend assessment. Results are reported as average scores for the nation, regions, and for various subgroups of the population such as race and ethnic groups. Data from the trend assessments are aVailable in the most recent report, NAEP 1996 Trends in Academic Progress, or in a brief summary report, Report in Brief: NAEP 1996 Trends in Academic Progress. Both reports are available on the World Wide Web at the NAEP Web site (http://nces.ed.govINAEP). In the main national NAEP, a nationally representative sample of students is assessed at grades 4, 8, and 12 in various academic subjects. The assessments change periodically and are based on frameworks developed by the National Assessment Governing Board (NAGB). Items include both multiple-choice and \"constructed-response\" (requiring written answers). Results are reported in two ways. Average scores are reported for the nation, participating states and jurisdictions, and for subgroups of the population. In addition, the percent of students at or above the basic, proficient, and advanced achievement levels are reported for these same groups. The achievement levels are developed by NAGB. Since 1990, main NAEP has also been conducted for states and other jurisdictions that choose to participate (47 participated in 1996). State data are usually available at grades 4 and/or 8, and may not include all subjects assessed in the national-level assessment. In 1994, for example, NAEP assessed reading, geography, and history at the national level at grades 4, 8, and 12 (only reading at grade 4 was assessed at the state level, however). In 1996, mathematics and science were assessed nationally at grades 4, 8, and 12. In the states, mathematics was assessed at grades 4 and 8, and science was assessed at grade 8 only. In 1997, the arts were assessed at the national level at grade so 8. Reading and writing were assessed in 1998 at the national level for grades 4, 8, and 12, and state levels for grades 4 and 8. Civics was assessed at the national level, as well. These assessments generally involve about 130,000 students at the national and state levels. In the trend, main national, and main state assessments, background information was collected from students, teachers, and school administrators. This information provides context within which academic performance of major student groups can be evaluated. Data are available on such student characteristics as gender, race and ethnicity, level of parents' education, eligibility for the free or reduced price lunch program, participation in the \"Title I\" to assist at-risk students, attendance at public or nonpublic schools, limited English proficiency, and presence of a disability. Characteristics of teachers include academic preparation and classroom practices. NAEP also reports on school characteristics such as courses offered, availability of computers, participation of parents, and the existence of problems such as tardiness or violence. To maintain its reputation as \"The Nation's Report Card\" and to enhance its serviceability to the nation, NAEP is undergoing a deliberately incremental redesign of its program. Beginning in 2000, main NAEP will reflect the results of extensive redesign. For example, assessments will take place annually. Assessment of academic subjects will be on a more regular basis than in the past. Core academic subjectsreading, writing, mathematics, and sciencewill be assessed every 4 years (reading may be assessed every 2 years). Frameworks for these subjects will be developed to last through three assessments (i.e., 12 years). Other subjects, such as geography, history, the arts, and foreign languages, will be assessed in the intervening years. Streamlining NAEP's sampling scheme, data collections, and reporting schedule while increasing the information value of the various subject matter tests will enable NCES to provide the nation an enriched, technically rigorous, and authoritative basis for making decisions about education. School Characteristics and Policy SurveyIn conjunction with student performance surveys, NCES routinely collects important supplemental data about school characteristics and school policies, which could be used analytically as contextual variables to enhance understanding of student performance issues. Specifically included in school data are: enrollment, curriculum testing and objective setting practices; school administrative practices; school conditions and facilities; special services; and programs. School level data also include some information about the characteristics of the school administrator such as: race-ethnicity, sex, undergraduate field of study, years as principal, administrative experience, and teaching experience. Teacher SurveySimilar to school contextual data, NAEP also collects important supplemental data from teachers whose students are respondents of the assessment surveys. Teacher data include: classroom instructional practices, race-ethnicity, sex, age, undergraduate field of study, teaching certification, full-time teaching experience, and subject matter specialization. information on HS&B). About 12,000 transcripts were collected from school records for HS&B sophomore cohort students who were seniors in 1982. Another transcript survey was conducted in conjunction with the 1992 second followup survey from the National Educational Longitudinal Study NELS:88 (see chapter 6 for more information). Three or four other transcript studies were done in conjunction with the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). Results from the 1981 High School Transcript Study were reported in American Education: Making It Work, in which course-taking patterns of 12th-grade students in 1982 and in 1987 were compared. The 1992 High School Transcript Study, done in conjunction with NAEP, can be used to track further changes in the curricular patterns of high school students. A 1993 High School Transcript Study was conducted in association with the 1994 NAEP. Another was conducted in 1998. High school transcript data inform researchers and policymakers about the course-taking patterns of students. Since the National Commission on Excellence in Education (NCEE) report, A Nation at Risk, there have been a number of critics advocating the strengthening of the high school core curriculum. Students have been encouraged to increase their academic load courses in English, mathematics, science, social studies, computer science, and foreign languages. As NCES has conducted more transcript studies, overall trends in course-taking patterns can be traced. Transcript data are measures of exposure rather than measures of learning, since they do not include information on course contents. More research is needed to determine what effect this exposure has on student achievement. The data collected by the transcript studies described in'this section allow investigation of the relationship between course-taking patterns and academic performance.\nIn the 1994 High School Transcript Study, about 25,000 transcript records were systematically transcribed to determine the course-taking patterns of 12th-grade high school students selected from the 1994 NAEP assessment sample. These records make it possible to link assessment results to course-taking patterns. The following three summary tables were included in the 1994 study: The percentage of high school graduates earning minimum credits in a core curriculum of courses recommended in 1983 by the NCEE in its report, A Nation at Risk. The 1994 percentages were compared with those from 1982, 1987, and 1990. The mean number of credits (Carnegie units) that graduates earned in each major subject field in 1994. The number of students who received credit in 1994 in secondary courses in NCES' Classification of Secondary School Courses. The 1994 coded data were compatible with the data produced in the 1982 HS&B Transcript Study and the 1987 High School Transcript Study. This standardization and comparability will be useful in later analyses for comparing the results of the three studies. The 1994 High School Transcript Study Tabulations: Comparative Data on Credits Earned and Demographics for 1994, 1987, and 1982High School Graduates (August 1997 \nThe 1992 National Assessment of Adult Literacy Survey (NAALS) defines literacy as \"using printed and written information to function in society, to achieve one's goals, and to develop one's knowledge and potential.\" Literacy was measured along three dimensions: Prose literacythe ability to understand and use information from connected texts that include editorials, news stories, and poems; Document literacythe ability to locate and use information contained in documents, such as job applications or payroll forms, bus schedules, maps, tables, and indexes; and Quantitative literacythe ability to apply arithmetic operations to numbers embedded in printed materials, such as balancing a checkbook, figuring a tip, completing an order form, or determining the amount of interest from a loan advertisement. Because policymakers needed to assess a broad range of abilities in the population, but did not need to diagnose literacy problems of individuals, the 1992 assessment was designed to cover a broad range of skills. All questions underwent extensive review by subject area and measurement specialists, as well as scrutiny to eliminate any bias or lack of sensitivity to particular groups. It would take any one individual about 4 hours to complete the entire assessment. To keep the burden on any one individual to less than 1 hour, the assessment was cut into 13 blocks, with only 6 blocks given to each respondent. The responses to the items were pooled and reported by proficiency scales on the three dimensions of literacy. NALS was administered in the summer of 1992 in person by trained interviewers to a nationally representative probability sample of about 15,000 individuals aged 16 and older, and to 1,000 adults incarcerated in federal and state prisons. In addition, 12 states funded sample supplements of 1,000 adults in order to obtain literacy estimates for their state populations. The results were published and the data are available to the public. Further information is available at the Web site (http://nces.ed.gov/nadlits). This is the first national study of literacy for all adults since the Adult Performance Level surveys, which were conducted in the early 1970s. \nThe design of the ECLSK is guided by a framework of children's development and schooling that emphasizes the interaction between the child and family, the child and school, the family and school; and the family, school, and community. Thus, the ECLSK recognizes the importance of factors that represent the child's health status and socio-emotional and intellectual development, and incorporates factors from the child's family, community, and school and classroom environments. The study is particularly interested in the role that parents and families play in helping children adjust to formal school and in supporting their education through the primary and middle 93 elementary grades. It is also interested in understanding how schools prepare for and respond to the diverse backgrounds and experiences of the children and families they serve. A nationally representative sample of approximately 23,000 children enrolled in about 1,000 kindergarten programs during the 1998-99 school year will be selected for participation in the ECLSK.,These children will be selected from full-day and part-day programs in public and private schools. The sample will consist of children from different racial-ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds. Presently, NCES plans to oversample private kindergartens and kindergartners. NCES also plans to oversample children who are Asian or Pacific Islander, and is exploring the feasibility of oversampling children with disabilities. The ECLSK sample will support separate analyses of public and private kindergartens, as well as white, black, Hispanic, and Asian and Pacific Islander children's school experiences and outcomes. Because numerous factors in schools, homes, and communities influence children's academic and social outcomes, data for the ECLSK will be collected not only from children, but from their parents-guardians, teachers, and school administrators. NCES intends to collect data on the sampled children and their environments in the fall and spring of the kindergarten year and in the spring of the first, third, and fifth grades.\nThe base year sample of 1988 eighth-graders was constructed to be representative at the national level. Two-stage probability sampling was used to select schools and students. The first stage involved stratified sampling of some 1,000 public and private schools from a universe of approximately 40,000 schools containing eighth-grade students. The second stage included random samples of approximately 24 to 26 students per school. Some 25,000 eighth-graders and their parents, their teachers, and their school principals were surveyed. When the student sample was selected, one parent, one school principal, and two teachers of each student were also selected as subsamples. Hispanic and Asian students were oversampled to permit analysis of,the performance of language minority students. NELS:88 is designed to provide trend data about critical transitions experienced by young people as they develop, attend school, and embark on their careers. It can complement and strengthen state and local efforts by furnishing new information on how school policies, teacher practices, and 109 family involvement affect student educational outcomes (i.e., academic achievement, persistence in school, and participation in postsecondary education). In the base year, four cognitive tests (reading, science, history-government, and math) were administered in addition to the student questionnaire, a parent questionnaire, a teacher questionnaire, and a school administrator questionnaire. The design for the NELS:88 First Followup Survey included student, school administrator, teacher, and dropout questionnaires. Students took cognitive tests in reading, science, historygovernment, and math. The tests were designed to reflect 10th-grade course work, but also had enough overlapping items with the 8th-and 12th-grade tests to permit measurement of academic growth. Selected teachers of each sampled student provided information about the student's study habits and performance, and about instructional practices in the student's classes. The NELS:88 First Followup was conducted between February and May of 1990. During the spring of 1992, NCES surveyed this eighth-grade cohort again. This second followup survey included student, school administrator, parent, teacher, and dropout questionnaires. Students and dropouts also took cognitive tests in reading, science, social science, and math. High school transcripts were also collected from second followup participants. For those researchers interested in school effects analyses, NCES also sponsored a School Effects Supplement. In 250 of the NELS:88 schools, additional students and teachers were added in first and second followup. During the spring of 1994, NCES followed this cohort again. The focus of the computerassisted telephone interviews (CATI) was employment, education, and family formation experiences. The sampled population was interviewed in order to determine whether they completed high school, and if so by what means (e.g., regular completion, GED, or some other method). The interview also collected information about other activities since the last interview in 1992 (e.g., working, number of jobs, what periods worked, description of work and education, postsecondary activities, field of study, and periods of time). This followup also asked questions about sexual activities (e.g., age at first sexual activity, frequency, whether birth control was used, and method of birth control used). The next followup is scheduled for 2000 by which time many in this cohort will have finished their postsecondary education and completed a transition into the labor force. Others will have been in the labor force for about 8 years.\nThe B&B is based on the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS) described separately (see chapter 4). NPSAS is a large, nationally representative sample of institutions, students, and parents. As such, it provides a highly efficient and cost-effective way of identifying a nationally representative sample of baccalaureate degree completers. For each NPSAS which serves as the base year for a B&B cohort, the sample is structured to provide an optimum sample of graduating seniors in all majors. This allows the accurate identification of baccalaureate degree completers, and provides additional information concerning both past education experiences and future education employment expectations. Data from all components of NPSAS are available as base-year data for the B&B sample. B&B will follow baccalaureate degree completers identified in alternating NPSAS surveys, beginning with NPSAS:93. About 11,000 students who completed their degree in the 1992-93 academic year were included in the first B&B followup (B&B:93/94). NPSAS:93 also provided data for over 8,000 of their parents. In addition to the student interview data, B&B:93/94 collected postsecondary transcripts covering the undergraduate period. These transcripts provide information on progress and persistence at the undergraduate level. The second B&B followup took place in spring 1997 (B&B:93/97). New Baccalaureate and Beyond cohorts will alternate with BPS in using NPSAS surveys as their base. The next scheduled B&B cohort will be associated with the NPSAS:2000.\nA nationally representative sample of students in intact classes at the grade levels where the modal age was 9-and 14-year-olds were asked to demonstrate how well they read and how well they understood what they read. The populations and sample sizes varied from country to country. In the United States, the sample included approximately 10,000 fourth-graders and 5,000 ninth-graders from 400 schools.\nThe IALS combined the techniques of household-based survey research with those of educational testing. Data collectors went to people's homes to assess their literacy abilities and to administer a background questionnaire requesting detailed information on demographic and other characteristics. Each country was obliged to draw a probability sample from which results representative of the civilian, noninstitutionalized population aged 16 to 65 could be derived.\nThe survey collects data on the libraries in the entire universe of accredited higher education institutions and on the libraries in nonaccredited institutions with a program of 4 years or more. ALS produces descriptive statistics on academic libraries in postsecondary institutions in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the outlying areas. NCES has developed a software package for states to use in submitting ALS data to NCES, 46 states used it in 1996. Like the Federal-State Cooperative System (FSCS) for public library data, ALS has an advisory committee. A librarian in each state helps state IPEDS coordinators collect, edit, and submit ALS data to NCES.\nThe survey collects data on state library agencies in the 50 states and the District of "}, {"section_title": "MAJOR PUBLICATIONS", "text": "Issue Brief: Do Districts Enrolling High Percentages of Minority Students Spend Less?

The boundaries of approximately 15,274 local education agencies, special education districts, Indian reservations, and military installations which have education activities within their boundaries were similarly digitized and encoded in the TIGER system, thus making it possible to convert the data from census blocks to education entities and produce tabulations. In 1992, under the sponsorship of NCES, the Census Bureau produced the 1990 Census School District Special Tabulation files Using the basic record file of 1990 decennial census data. These tabulations contain aggregate data describing attributes of groups of persons and households in school districts. With the exception of two data items (total population and total housing units), data were sample-based estimates. In many cases, the special tabulations used a process of splitting census blocks to develop estimates for a school district. Files were used in combination with NCES data (i.e., Common Core of Data) and other Census data (i.e., School District Financial SurveyF33) to produce the School District Data Book. In 1998, NCES initiated a multiyear project relating to the special tabulation specification of the 2000 Census and the 1999-2000 TIGER/Line files school district boundary. Similar to the 1990 Census Mapping Project, the Decennial Census School District 2000 Project will provide socialeconomic demographic characteristics of children and public school districts in the United States by using the school district special tabulation files from the 2000 census, the 1999-2000 CCD, and the 2000 School District Financial SurveyF33.

A standard format for different applications exists which spells out what information is included, where it is to be located, and in what form. This makes possible a common language between 'computers. SPEEDE/ExPRESS has developed into a strong and focused single effort to develop these EDI standards for education (elementary-secondary and postsecondary) and to promote their use. EDI standards that have already been developed or are currently being developed include student transcripts, personnel information, education institutional profile, financial aid information, and survey specific requests. Among the direct and indirect benefits that users of EDI receive are: reduction of paperwork and associated savings, faster transmission of critical educational administrative information, improvement in the reliability of information exchanged between educational entities, and more effective data management and reporting.

Its linked sampling plan provides information on schools (and in the public sector, their associated districts), the principals who head these schools, and the teachers who work in them. The survey was designed in the mid-1980s in response to the school reform movement of that decade. Its primary purposes have been to monitor teacher supply and demand conditions, characteristics and qualifications of teachers and principals, and basic conditions in schools. Along these dimensions, the survey was designed to provide comparable information on both the public and private sectors, as well as trend data over time. In addition, SASS provides state representative data for the public sector and affiliation representative data for private sector. SASS' large sample sizes (approximately 6,000 school districts; 10,000 public schools; 3,500 private schools; 60,000 public school teachers; and 12,000 private school teachers) allow extensive disaggregation of data by important characteristics of schools, such as the poverty level of the students, urbanicity, and minority enrollment; and of teachers; such as their demographic characteristics and teaching assignment field. SASS data were first collected in the 1987-88 school 3 3 25 year, and again in the 1990-91 and 1993-94 school years. One year after each collection, a followup survey of teachers was conducted to measure teacher attrition and mobility (see the \"Teacher Followup Survey\" desciption in this section). SASS is being redesigned for its next administration in school year 1999-2000, and is planned to be conducted every 5 years. Data from SASS have been used by Congress, the U.S. Department of Education and other federal agencies, state education agencies, educational associations, business firms that market educational services, and the education research community for the following purposes: To provide information on aspects of teacher supply and demand, shortages, and turnover, such as methods of covering unfilled vacancies and policies, practices, and circumstances influencing supply and demand conditions. To describe the qualifications of teachers to teach in their subject fields and, in particular, to monitor the rate of out-of-field teaching (i.e., teachers teaching in a subject area without a college major or minor in that field). To monitor rates of attrition from the teaching profession, the reasons for attrition, and the characteristics of teachers leaving the profession. To provide information on school conditions and programs, including basic descriptors of schools, enrollments, organization, curriculum, student programs and services, staffing, student characteristics, school climate, and teacher workplace conditions. To profile the teacher workforce, including demographic characteristics, academic background, qualifications to teach in fields of assignment, workload, career plans, compensation, and perceptions of the teaching profession and their workplace.

The FRSS also has the capability of conducting brief surveys of households using randomdigit-dialing telephone techniques.\nInstitutional Characteristics-,-Address, county, telephone number, room and board charges, tuition, required fees, control or affiliation, calendar system, levels of awards offered, types of programs, and accreditation. In addition, the IC survey collects the instructional activity and unduplicated headcount data, needed to compute a standardized full-time equivalent (FTE) enrollment statistic for the entire academic year. Flb is useful for gauging the size of the educational enterprise at the institution. Fall EnrollmentFull-and part-time enrollment by level (undergraduate first-professional and graduate); and by race-ethnicity and sex of student. Beginning in 1990, racial-ethnic data were collected annually. (Prior to 1990 racial-ethnic data were collected in even-numbered years.) Age distributions are collected in odd-numbered years by student level; data on state of residence of firsttime freshmen (first-time first-year students) are collected in even-numbered years. Four-year institutions are also required to complete enrollment data by level, race-ethnicity, and sex for nine selected fields of study in even-numbered years for the OCR.

The National Household Education Survey (NHES) is the first general purpose survey conducted by NCES to collect education data through a household-based survey As a householdbased survey, the NHES has the potential to address many issues in education that have not been addressed previously by NCES data collection activities. Full-scale NILES collections have been conducted in the springs   The NHES provides data on a wide range of current education issues. The issues vary by component and are provided in the \"components\" description, below.\nAdult Education Components (NHES:91 and NHES:95)Participation in adult education activities in the previous 12 months and characteristics for participants; main reasons for participation; the subject matter, duration, sponsorship, purpose, and cost of course; and barriers to participation of sampled nonparticipants.

Policy analysts, program planners, and decisionmakers in postsecondary education frequently need data on emerging issues quickly. It is not always feasible for NCES to use its large, recurring surveys to provide such data quickly due to the length of time required to implement large-scale data collection efforts. NCES established topics Postsecondary Education Quick Information System (PEQIS) in 1991, to collect timely data on focused issues needed for program planning and policy development with a minimum burden on respondents. Recent survey topics include distance learning, remedial education, campus crime and security, finances, and accommodation of disabled students. In addition to obtaining information on emerging issues quickly, PEQIS surveys are used to assess the feasibility of developing large-scale data collection efforts on a given topic, or to supplement other NCES postsecondary surveys.\nStudent AssessmentsSampled children will be asked to participate in various activities in order to measure important cognitive and noncognitive outcomes. At least through the end of first grade, all direct measures of a child's skills will be obtained through a one-on-one assessment. In the kindergarten and first grade waves, there will be direct measures of children's cognitive skills, social cognition, and psychomotor development. The cognitive test battery will measure children's receptive, expressive, and nonverbal reasoning abilities in language-literacy, mathematics, and general knowledge (i.e., science and social studies). Measures of children's social cognition will help ascertain children's understanding of social problems and how they can be solved. Measures of physical development will include both height and weight measurements. Also, in the fall of kindergarten, a psychomotor assessment will be administered which will include measures of children's motor ability, coordination, and visual motor skills. Parent-Guardian InterviewsParents-guardians are an important source of information about the families of the children selected for the study and about themselves. In telephone interviews (or in personal interviews for households without telephones), they will be asked to provide key information about children's development at school entry and their experiences both with family members and others. The family background, demographics, and home environment content to be covered in the parent-guardian interviews in the kindergarten and first grade waves of the ECLSK includes: family structure; immigration status; primary language(s) spoken; parent's involvement with the child's education; child care; child's health and well-being; parental values, beliefs, and expectations; home environment, activities, and cognitive stimulation; parental monitoring; neighborhood; parent education and human capital; parent employment; parent income and assets; welfare and other public transfers; discipline, warmth, and emotional supportiveness; parent's psychological well-being and health; and critical family processes. The kindergarten and first grade parent-guardian interviews will also include items asking parents-guardians to provide a rating of their child's social skills, problem behaviors, and approaches toward learning. Teacher QuestionnairesLike parents, teachers represent a valuable source of information on themselves and the children's learning environment (i.e., the classroom). In self-administered questionnaires, teachers will be asked to provide information about their own backgrounds, teaching practices, and experience along with information on the classroom setting for the sampled children .1. 0 () 94 4 they teach. The content to be covered in the teacher questionnaires in the kindergarten and first grade waves of the ECLSK includes: class type and composition, class organization, class activities, topics covered and evaluation methods, parent involvement, views on readiness, professional development, and teacher's background. Teacher RatingIn addition to filling out a questionnaire, teachers will be asked to evaluate each sampled child on a number of critical cognitive and noncognitive dimensions. Teacher cognitive ratings will measure teachers' perceptions of students' academic achievement and dispositions for learning in the three domains of language-literacy, mathematics, and general knowledge. Ratings of children's socio-emotional performance will provide measures of children's pro-social behaviors, social competence skills, and problem behaviors. Teachers will also be asked to complete a checklist on each sampled child reporting on such things as the children's language skills, special needs, program placements, attendance, and physical activity. School QuestionnairesIn a self-administered questionnaire, school administrators, principals, and headmasters will be asked to provide information on the physical and organizational characteristics of their schools, and on their schools' learning environment and programs. Special attention will be paid to the instructional philosophy of the school and its expectations for students. The content to be covered in the school questionnaires in the kindergarten and first grade waves of the ECLSK includes: school characteristics, student characteristics, teaching staff characteristics, school policies and programs, principal characteristics, and school governance and climate.

Each included items in three domains of reading literacy: narrative, expository, and document. Student QuestionnaireTwo student questionnaires were administered, one for 9-year-olds and another for 14-year-olds. Each included items related to age, gender, size and composition of family, family wealth (as indicated by possessions in the home), parents' education, first language, and reading habits. Teacher QuestionnaireTwo teacher questionnaires were developed: one for the teachers of the intact classes of 9-year-olds that were surveyed, and one for the teachers of the intact classes of 14year-olds. Both teacher questionnaires included items related to gender, education, work experience, composition of the class, supervision, and general school ethos. The survey of the teachers of the intact classes of 9-year-olds also included extensive questions on instructional practices. SchoolPrincipal QuestionnaireThis questionnaire was designed to gather basic demographic information about the school population as a whole. It also included questions related to resources, teacher qualifications, school-based policies, supervision of teaching staff, and the principal's education, training, credentials, and work experience. \nLiteracy AssessmentThe study includes a proficiency test based on United States definitions of literacy along three dimensions: prose literacy, document literacy, and quantitative literacy. The test framework explicitly follows the precedent set by the U.S. National Assessment of Adult Literacy Survey and extends the instruments into an international context. One hundred and fourteen tasks were constructed and administered to adults in each participating country. These items were grouped into three scales and divided into blocks of items. Any given adult responded to three blocks of items that, on average, would take about 45 minutes to complete. Background QuestionnaireThe background questionnaire provides for standard information across countries on occupation, labor force participation, and educational attainment, and was to be administered in about 20 minutes. Additional demographic information on gender, age, parent's occupation, native language, and reading habits was also gathered. \nAcademic Library SurveyTotal operating expenditures; full-time-equivalent library staff; service outlets; total volumes held at the end of the fiscal year; circulation; interlibrary loans; public service hours; patron count; and reference transactions per typical week.\nFederal Library SurveyOrganization and structure; mission and subject areas; type of users; size of facility; classification system; staffing; collections; operational expenditures; automation; technology; and preservation; government depository; service hours; visits; reference questions; online searcher; Internet searcher, interlibrary loan; circulation, cooperative arrangements; and trends.

This conference issues an open call for proposals, and thus reflects a wide range of topics and presenters. There is no registration fee and the Data Conference is open to the public. The NCES Web site (http://nces.ed.gov) gives full information about registration. Each year NCES co-sponsors a Management Information Systems (MIS) Conference with a host state. The purpose of this 3-day meeting, usually held in late February, is to encourage those who work with education MIS systems to share their innovations, developmental efforts, and issues with one another.

As part of its ongoing effort to increase cooperation among federal, state, and local education data collectors, and to improve the overall quality and timeliness of education statistics, NCES initiated the Cooperative System Fellows Program in 1990. Twice each year, Fellows are nominated by local, state, higher education, and library agencies across the country and convene in Washington, DC, for 1 week. The purpose is to provide the participants with an overview of NCES' many activities and to foster professional ties between education professionals and members of the federal statistical community. During their stay, the Fellows take part in a series of planned activities including presentations by NCES staff on its major data collections, reports, and dissemination practices; projects to automate state and local data systems; and efforts to integrate existing data collections. In addition, Fellows explore their own professional interests and objectives. During the week, mentors selected from NCES' staff work with the Fellows and lead discussions on various topics, answer questions, and offer guidance and advice.

Some topical supplements may be attached to these continuing surveys so that current data on key issues can be produced. The Fast Response Survey System (FRSS) collects additional topical data for policymakers within a short time frame. Beginning with the 1998-99 school year, the CCD began collecting an expanded set of information intended to greatly enhance the surveys' usefulness as a sampling frame and provide baseline statistics on several programs of interest. States will be asked to identify charter and magnet schools, schools that participate in Title I programs, and the numbers of students receiving special services for migrant children, or those who have limited English proficiency. This additional information, coupled with the CCD's current content and unique identifiers for every public school and agency, will make it possible to explore ways of merging information from different surveys, and to reduce the chances that the same information will be requested on more than one federal survey. NCES is also currently analyzing CCD data to determine whether it is possible to convert dropout reports that do not follow NCES conventions into the standard CCD format. If this can be done, beginning with the 1998-99 school year, the CCD will be able to produce both dropout and high school graduation rates for at least 30 states. On or around the year 2000, the CCD finance surveys expect to incorporate changes in response to the revised Government Accounting Standards Board (GASB) standards. The final shape of these standards is not yet known. SASS has been redesigned for its next administration in 1999-2000. The sample design and data collection methodology will remain the same, but a new conceptual framework will shift the focus of SASS from teacher supply and demand to measurement of teacher and school capacity (the objectives of recent school reform agendas). Teacher capacity is defined by measures of teacher quality, teacher career paths (including induction experience), professional development, and classroom instructional practices. School capacity is defined by measures of school organization and decisionmaking, curriculum and instruction, parental involvement, school safety and discipline, and school resources. Although the framework requires new item modules, important items from past surveys will be retained for trend data. The Teacher Followup Survey will continue to be implemented 1 year after the SASS. The NHES has become a source of many key indicators of the educational status of children and adults. For the most part, the NITES:99 is a composite collection of previously administered education indicators. It will provide the second, third, fourth, or fifth point on a trend line. In the NHES:99, breadth of coverage in topics and populations will necessitate less depth of coverage. However, the questionnaire will cover indicators from previous NHES components, such as Early Childhood Program Participation, including after school program participation-activities, School Readiness, School Safety and Discipline, Parent and Family Involvement in Education, and Civic Involvement. The NHES:99 is being conducted in the winter-spring of 1999. The NHES:01 and 03 are currently being planned. Topics for NHES:01 are likely to include Early Childhood Program Participation, and After School Program Participation/Activities. Topics for NHES:03 are likely to include School Readiness and Parent Involvement in Education. NCES will continue to support the collection of educational enrollment and attainment on an annual basis in the October Supplement to the Current Population Survey. The additional topical component regarding select education characteristics, grade repetitionlanguage and English proficiencydisability will be collected every 4 years. The computer-use component will also be conducted every 4 years. The School Survey on Crime and Safety (SSOCS) is a new survey sponsored by NCES that will collect information from school principals on crime and safety in U.S. elementary and secondary schools. SSOCS will first be administered in the spring of 2000. However, in many ways it will replicate the Principal/School Disciplinarian survey on School Violence conducted by NCES in 1997. Thus, some information on changes over time will be available even in 2000. After that initial survey, NCES plans to conduct SSOCS every 2 years to provide continued updates on crime and safety in U.S. schools. NCES is working on the Decennial Census School District 2000 Project. The project will use data from the 2000 census, 1999-2000 Common Core of Data, and the 2000 School District Financial SurveyF33. The project's product will provide substantial social-economic demographic data on individual public school district to data users, researchers, and policymakers. The FRSS will continue to identify and report on issues of current interest. Studies being prepared now include Summer Programs for Migrant Students: 1998; Adult Services Provided by Public Libraries: 1998; and Teacher Survey on Professional Development: 1998. As part of the FRSS, NCES will collect data every 2 years beginning in 1998 to provide information for the Secretary of Education's biennial reports on Teacher Quality, which are intended to monitor progress toward the goal of having dedicated and outstanding teachers in every classroom. The National Cooperative Education Statistics System will continue to serve as the vehicle for improving the elementary-secondary data system across the nation. Under the Forum on Education Statistics, it will sponsor projects in individual states to adopt common data standards and definitions, and to develop more efficient ways of collecting and reporting data electronically. Federal-State Forum task forces will complete data standards or guidelines in the areas of reporting data about school facilities, protecting the privacy of education staff records, sharing data among different agencies, and identifying ke.y data elements in the area of school finance that are needed to produce comparable and useful education indicators.

The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) program in postsecondary education provides statistical information used by planners, policymakers, and educators in addressing these issues. One major source of this information is the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), an annual series of surveys conducted by NCES that provides a variety of data on the nation's 10,600 public and private postsecondary institutions. Special studies of student financial aid, postsecondary faculty, and doctoral degree recipients complement IPEDS, as do surveys of the participation of the adult population in educational activities through the National Household Education Survey. In addition, postsecondary education transcript studies have been conducted in conjunction with the National Longitudinal Study of 1972, the High School and Beyond Study, the Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (see the \"National Longitudinal Studies\" in chapter 5), and the Recent College Graduates Study. Another postsecondary longitudinal survey system, Baccalaureate and Beyond, is collecting institutibnal and student data from postsecondary students over a period of several years (see \"National Longitudinal Studies,\" chapter 6). The National Study of Postsecondary Faculty gathers data on postsecondary faculty."}, {"section_title": "1", "text": "Members of the executive branch, Congress or congressional committees, and a number of independent federal agencies use information from NCES on a regular basis. For example, an office of the legislative branch used IPEDS information to develop a profile of proprietary, less-than-2-year institutions. Several executive branch offices use the information to track baccalaureate and higher degree data by selected fields of study and minority status of degree recipients. An independent federal agency uses the information to track degree completions in engineering and scientific fields of study. State higher education agencies regularly use the data to help determine salary and fringe benefit packages for their full-time instructional staff. Other state agencies use the completions and institutional data on an annual basis to evaluate the availability of specific career training programs. Several state agencies have used the residence and migration data to determine where their high school graduates enroll in postsecondary education institutions. National and regional education associations annually request tabulations to determine enrollment patterns by racial-ethnic categories and fields of study, and finance data to review the economic health of postsecondary education institutions. Individual institutions use similar information at an institutional level for peer analyses and institutional planning purposes. These peer analyses range from comparing selected financial ratios to comparing proportions of minority student enrollments. The media, business community, and the general public use the information in a variety of ways. For example, one newspaper used the data to develop a major article that compares public 4year institutions across selected states. Members of the business community have used degree completion data to target minority recruitment efforts in selected fields of study. The general public regularly requests information on which institutions offer degrees in specific fields of study."}, {"section_title": "Studies Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System", "text": "The Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), established as the core postsecondary education data collection program for NCES, is a system of surveys designed to collect data from all primary providers of postsecondary education. IPEDS is a single, comprehensive system designed to encompass all institutions and educational organizations whose primary purpose is to provide postsecondary education. The IPEDS system is built around a series of interrelated surveys to collect institution-level data in such areas as enrollments, program completions, faculty, staff, finances, and academic libraries."}, {"section_title": "\". 62 54", "text": "This universe of postsecondary education institutions is divided into three categories based on the highest degree awarded or the length of the longest program: Baccalaureate or higher degree institutions; Two-year award institutions (that is, institutions must have at least a 2-year program but less than a 4-year program); and Less-than-2-year institutions. Each of these three categories is further disaggregated by type of financial control: public, private nonprofit, and private for profit. The resulting nine institutional categories are called \"sectors\" within the IPEDS universe and are used, in conjunction with accreditation status, to determine which data collection forms institutions complete. Despite the diversity of institutions across these sectors, since institutions are the primary unit for data collection, institutional units must be defined as consistently as possible. IPEDS does not request separate reports from more than one component within an individual institution. However, separate branch campuses are asked to report as individual units, thus each institution in a multiinstitutional system and each separate branch in a multicampus system reports separately. IPEDS defines a branch institution as \"a campus or site that is not temporary, is located in a community beyond a reasonable commuting distance from its parent institution, and offers organized programs of study, not just courses.\" This last criterion is the most important. It means that at least one degree or award program can be completed entirely at the site, without requiring any attendance at the main campus, or any other institution within the system. The IPEDS universe of postsecondary institutions includes only those institutions that are open to the general public. Therefore, training sites at prisons, military bases, and corporations, are not considered as separate institutions or branches in IPEDS, regardless of how the institutional system classifies such training sites. Data on enrollment, finance, completions, and from such locations or training sites, are to be incorporated into the data reported by the main 'campus or any other institution or branch campus in the system that is most appropriate. With respect to postsecondary education provided in conjunction with hospitals, the intent of IPEDS is to include only those hospitals that contain one or more separate entities whose primary purpose is the provision of postsecondary education. A school of nursing or a school of radiology are two examples of such entities. Hospitals offering only internships or residency programs are not to be included, nor are hospitals that only offer training as part of a medical school program. Training conducted as part of a medical school program should be included in the reports of the postsecondary institution offering the medical program. Hospitals operating more than one school are treated as a single postsecondary entity. This is consistent with the practice for all other postsecondary institutions, where NCES only requests reports for the institution as a whole, not separate reports for each program within the institution. Since the definition of postsecondary education excludes noncredit continuing education programs and education units, organizational entities that provide only these educational services are not included as institutions. Schools whose only mission is to prepare students to take a particular test, such as the CPA examination or the Bar examination, are not included in IPEDS. These programs are not considered academic, vocational, or continuing professional. Organizations that offer training at many sites (such as H&R Block) may be consolidated into a single institutional unit when deemed appropriate by NCES. High schools with vocational programs are also excluded from IPEDS because their primary purpose is not postsecondary education."}, {"section_title": "55", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "DATA COLLECTION PRINCIPLES", "text": "The collection of IPEDS data from this diverse universe of institutions is based upon several principles. First, data elements identify characteristics common to all providers of postseCondary education. Within these data elements, specific values define characteristics of different types of providers of postsecondary education. As mentioned in the \"Design\" section, although accreditation is not a requirement for inclusion in IPEDS, it is a data element that distinguishes specific institutions in IPEDS. Second, the data elements and the component surveys in IPEDS, through which they are collected, are interrelated to avoid duplicative reporting and enhance the analytic potential of the database. For example, enrollment data from one survey may be used in conjunction with data on degrees granted, faculty, or financial resources from other surveys. To deal with the problems of data comparability involved in interstate and interinstitutional comparisons, IPEDS includes questions that help to clarify what is or is not included in a reported count or total. Third, the surveys are compatible, but are adapted to meet the needs and characteristics of the different sectors of postsecondary education providers. In general, the survey questionnaires for postsecondary institutions granting baccalaureate and higher degrees are the most extensive. Forms for the other sectors request less data. This feature accommodates the varied operating characteristics, program offerings, and reporting capabilities of postsecondary institutions, while yielding comparable statistics for all institutions. Prior to 1993, NCES sampled the private, less-than-2-year sectors. However, the Higher Education Act of 1992 mandated the completion of IPEDS surveys in a timely and accurate manner for all institutions that participate, or are applicants for participation, in any federal student financial assistance program authorized by Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as mandated (20 U.S.C. 1094(a)(17). Thus, beginning in the 1993 survey year, NCES began to survey in detail all postsecondary institutions that met this mandate. Those that are not eligible to participate in federal student financial aid programs currently receive only a basic Institutional Characteristics form. Between 1993 and 1996, NCES began to examine the universe of accredited institutions in order to form a crosswalk between the IPEDS data files and those maintained by the Office of Postsecondary Education (OPE) for student financial aid purposes. During this period, OPE discontinued their policy of differentiating institutions by level of accreditation (i.e., those accredited at the higher education level (formerly the Higher Education General Information Survey (REGIS) universe) and those with occupational-vocational accreditation). Since IPEDS was no longer able to identify the HEGIS institutions, a new approach was developed to categorize institutions for mailout and analysis purposes. Thus, beginning with the 1997 mailout, the IPEDS universe is subdivided based on accreditation, level of institution, and degree-granting status. First, IPEDS identifies and separates institutions according to accreditation status. Accredited institutions, those with Program Participation Agreements (PPAs) that are eligible for federal student financial aid, will be surveyed in detail. Institutions that are not accredited, and thus not eligible for federal student financial aid, will only receive the Institutional Characteristics survey (IC4 or IC4A). Second, institutions are divided into groups by degree-granting status and level of award: The certificate-granting schools in group three are required to complete the IC survey, the GRS, and the CN which is made up of four or five parts (depending on the year in which the data are collected) that request minimal data on enrollment, completions, finance, and either staff or library information. As mentioned earlier, institutions without PPA's with the U.S. Department of Education (and are thus not participating in federal student financial aid under Title IV) are asked to complete the IC survey only. IPEDS attempts to minimize institutional respondent burden by coordinating data collection with the state education agencies and other federal offices and agencies that regularly collect data from institutions. These coordinating efforts include: State AgenciesIn many states, IPEDS institutional data are provided by the state higher education agency from data collected on state surveys. Alternatively, state agencies may extract data from IPEDS surveys rather than conduct their own surveys.

The NPSAS collects information on student demographics, family income, education expenses, employment, education aspirations, parental demographic characteristics, parental support, and how students and their families meet the costs of postsecondary education. In addition to describing characteristics of students enrolled in postsecondary education, the results are used in part to help determine future federal policy regarding student financial aid. The first NPSAS was conducted during the 1986-87 school year. Data were gathered from institutional records on about 60,000 students at 1,100 colleges, universities, and other postsecondary institutions. About 43,000 of these students and 13,000 parents also completed questionnaires. During 1989-90, information from institutional records on about 69,000 students at 1,130 postsecondary institutions was collected. About 51,400 students and 16,000 parents also completed computer-assisted telephone interviews. During 1992-93, information from institutional records on about 77,000 students at 1,000 postsecondary institutions was collected. About 52,000 students and 12,500 parents were interviewed by telephone. The 1995-96 NPSAS has a smaller sample due to budget constraints. Institutional administrative records data were collected on about 60,000 students at 830 institutions. About 31,000 students were interviewed by telephone.

Through their research, development, and public service activities faculties make valuable contributions to society. For these reasons, it is essential to understand who they are; what they do; and whether, how, and why they are changing. The NSOPF was designed to provide data about faculty to postsecondary education researchers, planners, and policymakers. NSOPF is currently the most comprehensive study of faculty in postsecondary educational institutions. NSOPF contains data that can be applied to policy and research issues related to postsecondary faculty. For example, NSOPF can be used to analyze whether the postsecondary labor force is declining or increasing. NSOPF data can also be used to analyze faculty job satisfaction and how it correlates with an area of specialization, how background and specialization skills relate to present assignments, and the relationship of academic rank and outside employment.

Twice each year, Fellows are nominated by local, state, higher education, and library agencies across the country and convene in Washington, DC, for 1 week. The purpose is to provide the participants with an overview of NCES' many activities and to foster professional ties between education professionals and members of the federal statistical community. During their stay, the Fellows take part in a series of planned activities including presentations by NCES staff on NCES' major data collections, reports, and dissemination practices; projects to automate state and local data systems; and efforts to integrate existing data collections. In addition, Fellows explore their own professional interests and objectives. During the week, mentors selected from NCES staff work with the Fellows and lead discussions on various topics, answer questions, and offer guidance and advice.

Handbooks have been an integral part of NCES's postsecondary program since the late 1960s. In 1966, NCES established a common language that higher education institutions could use to record and report on major fields of study. This language, codes from the Higher Education General Information Survey (REGIS), evolved into the Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) that encompasses not only the academic programs included in the HEGIS program codes but vocational and occupational program codes as well. The CIP was implemented in 1986 with the beginning of the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) and was revised in 1990. It forms the basis for the IPEDS Completion report.

This manual, initially developed by a group of facilities experts, evolved through several versions and was issued and used with the approval of professional groups, state agencies, and institutional associations. Last published in 1974, the manual was widely used and adapted. In recognition of the fact that planning for and use of facilities had changed significantly and many states and institutions were beginning to devise their own classifications structures, the State Higher Education Executive Officers (SHEE0) assembled a Working Group on College and University Facilities in 1989. The work of these groups resulted in the 1992 Postsecondary Education Facilities Inventory and Classification Manual (FICM). The 1992 FICM provides a common framework and coding structure for use in collecting and reporting inventory data on postsecondary institution buildings, and on the space within those structures, primarily rooms. The manual also suggests to 74 institutions a pattern for compiling essential data on their physical facilities, and provides a set of common building definitions and room codes so that reported data are reasonably consistent and comparable across institutions and states. NCES has published the first handbook on faculty and staff in postsecondary institutions. The 1998 Human Resources in Postsecondary Institutions Handbook provides postsecondary institutions with coding structures, data element definitions, analytic conventions, and recommendations for developing and maintaining a central data file on the institution's faculty and staff that will be useful for resource and policy analysis and planning at the institutional level. This handbook, as with all other NCES handbooks and manuals, was developed in conjunction with a technical panel of experts in the field of faculty and human resource issues and problems. One objective in developing this handbook was to provide institutions with the tools necessary to report high quality data to the IPEDS Staff and Salary surveys, and to facilitate their participation in the National Survey of Postsecondary Faculty."}, {"section_title": "The development of the Postsecondary Student Handbook is a cooperative effort between NCES, SHEEO, and the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers.", "text": "The primary objective of this handbook is to promote commonality and consistency in the data elements and definitions that are used to define, track, measure, and report postsecondary student data. The handbook identifies a comprehensive and uniform set of data elements, definitions, and coding descriptors to use in postsecondary student record keeping systems. The handbook also provides recommendations for standardizing the methods and practices by which data on students are collected, reported, and exchanged; suggests a framework for developing or upgrading student tracking systems; and identifies and promotes sound practices for institutional reporting to state and federal agencies. A revised edition of this handbook will be published in 1999. Some postsecondary institutions use an automated data system for a nationwide electronic records transfer system. The Standardization of Postsecondary Education Electronic Data Exchange developed a set of data elements and definitions in American National Standards Institute format to be used in the pilot electronic transfer of student records between postsecondary institutions. Data elements are included in five different areas: demographics, academic history, special programs and services, health, and test information. NCES is examining other applications for the electronic exchange of data among postsecondary institutions. In response to legislation and based on the findings from a feasibility study, NCES collected, compiled, and reported graduation-completion rates of a sample of postsecondary institutions in conjunction with the implementation of the Student-Right-to-Know legislation in 1996. With the planning and design phases completed in the 1996-97 school year, institutional graduationcompletion rate data were collected through the IPEDS beginning in the 1997-98 school year from the universe of all postsecondary institutions in the United States eligible for Title IV financial aid. The National Household Education Survey (NHES) has become a source of many key indicators of the educational status of children and adults. For the most part, the NHES:99 is envisioned to be a composite collection of previously administered education indicators. For these indicators, it will provide the second, third, fourth, or fifth points on a trend line. In the NHES:99, breadth of coverage in topics and in populations to be sampled will necessitate less depth of coverage. However, the questionnaire will cover indicators from previous NILES components, such as Adult Education and Adult Civic Involvement. The NBES:99 is being conducted in the spring of 1999. The NHES:01 and 03 are currently being planned. Topics for NHES:01 are likely to include adult education, while topics for NHES:03 are likely to include work-related adult education. The next cycle of the National Study of Postsecondary Faculty (NSOPF) is occurring in the 1998-99 academic year. NSOPF-99 is limited to surveys of institutions, faculty, and instructional staff. It will allow for comparisons to be made over time and expands existing topics surrounding faculty and instructional staff that have developed as critical issues since the first two studies. Examples of possible expansion topics are: the increasing use of part-time instructional faculty and staff at higher education institutions and their credentials for teaching; the decline of full-time tenuretrack appointments as institutions explore possible alternatives to tenure; faculty's allocation of time to teaching versus research; measures of faculty workload and productivity; the presence of women and minority faculty in higher education institutions; and the effects, if any, of the removal of mandatory retirement for faculty and instructional staff. NSOPF-99 will also allow for Internet collection of survey responses for the first time. Meeting the challenges of maintaining current data and possibly establishing new data collection activities will take a cooperative effort among institutions, states, and NCES. In order to support this effort, NCES' reauthorization of 1994, included the extension of the National Cooperative Education Statistics System to postsecondary education. The National Postsecondary Education Cooperative will continue to strive to identify new trends in postsecondary education and emerging issues that have implications for data collection, reporting, and dissemination in order to facilitate the production of better data for better decisions.  1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 National  Computer Use Selected Education Characteristics: The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) collects and reports information on the academic performance of the nation's students. NCES also assesses the literacy level of the adult population. NCES also participates in international assessments (see chapter 7, \"International Statistics\"). The congressionally mandated National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is NCES' primary assessment of what American elementary and secondary students know and can do in academic subjects. For more than two decades, NAEP has collected and reported information on the knowledge and skills of national and, since 1990, state samples of both age-and graderepresentative populations in a variety of school subjects. NCES also collects data from students' high school transcripts. These data include courses students have taken as well as the grades they attained. These studies generally build on NAEP and other major survey studies to increase their analytical usefulness. Additionally, data are collected from postsecondary student transcripts as part of longitudinal or cross-sectional studies, such as the Recent College Graduates Study. Besides assessing student achievements, the educational assessment program at NCES also assesses the proficiency of adults in performing basic literacy and mathematical tasks through the National Assessment of Adult Literacy Survey. In 1992, NCES conducted a household-based literacy survey of adults aged 16 and over. This survey included the general adult population as well as adults in institutional settings such as prisons. High school transcript data have been used for a variety of assessment purposes. Most notably, such data have been used to monitor trends or patterns in curricular changes. The 1994 High School Transcript Study compared the course-taking patterns of students in 1994 with similar patterns in 1990, 1987, and 1982. Extensive analyses of high school vocational education enrollments and of course-taking patterns of high school students with disabilities have been conducted through the National Assessment of Vocational Education and in NCES reports. Together with performance results in subject areas, the basic descriptive information about students, teachers, administrators, and communities collected systematically by NAEP from its surveys has been used to address the following four educational policy issues that are of concern to educators, policymakers, and researchers: Instructional practices: 'What instructional methods are being used and how do these relate to achievement?' Students at risk: 'How many students appear to be at risk, in terms of achievement, and what are their characteristics?' Distribution of teacher qualities among different student populations: 'What are the characteristics of teachers of various subjects that students are exposed to?' Education reform: 'What, if any, policy changes are being made by our nation's schools?' Over the past 27 years, NAEP has generated more than 200 reports spanning 11 instructional areas. It is the nation's only ongoing, comprehensive, and representative assessment of what American students know and can do."}, {"section_title": "87", "text": "Data Uses NAEP data have been used frequently in numerous ways by researchers, educators, policymakers, and the general public.

In year 2000, NAEP mathematics and science assessments will be assessed in both grades 4 and 8 in the state assessment. Previously, state assessments never included both grades in two subjects. An innovative \"market basket\" assessment will be developed in the 2000 assessment which might produce better reporting and also possibly permit linking to other tests. In addition, a number of typical \"standard assessments\" in a variety of subjects will be complimented by in-depth \"comprehensive assessments\" in mathematics, reading, the arts, science, U.S. history, and geography. Also, new comprehensive assessments will be administered in foreign languages, world history, and economics. These major changes are documented in a new 10-year calendar that identifies subjects to be tested from 2000 to 2010. These and other possible changes are being monitored constantly by outside panels of experts and citizens through such institutions as the National Academy of Sciences. Through this process, NAEP will endeavor to remain the nation's foremost instrument in measuring the academic skills of the nation's elementary and secondary school students. In addition to NAEP, NCES is working on the development of the National Assessment of Adult Literacy Survey, a national assessment that will expand on the 1992 National Adult Literacy Survey.

In this way, intervening processes can be studied. These analyses require the periodic examination of educational and occupational attainment, aspirations, attitudes, and motivations during the pivotal years before, during, and after elementary school, middle-junior high school, high school, and college. With extensive questioning over succeeding years, longitudinal studies make it possible to make long-range comparisons between what individuals expect and what actually occurs. Consequently, such studies are critical to understanding the processes by which education leads individuals to develop their abilities and their roles in society.

Vital to efforts to improve schools and the education of all the nation's children is a research and data collection program that increases understanding of the dynamics of school achievement, particularly of those factors that lead to the differential success of important groups of children during the early school years.

The Early Childhood Longitudinal StudyKindergarten Cohort (ECLSK), in which a cohort of entering kindergarten children will be sampled and studied intensively over time, responds directly to the concerns decisionmakers, educational practitioners, researchers, and parents have about our nation's schools and American education. The three key issues to be addressed by the ECLSK are: children's status at kindergarten entry, critical transitions, and student growth and progress. First, the ECLSK will examine the status of children's characteristics and experiences as they enter school and will seek to describe ways in which these are related to different aspects of children, their families, and the kindergarten programs they attend. Besides being interested in the role that parents and families play in preparing for and supporting their children's education, the study is also interested in how the educational system prepares for and responds to children. It will pay particular attention to how schools and teachers respond to the diverse backgrounds and experiences that children bring with them as they enter school for the first time. Second, children experience a variety of transitionsfrom home to school, from school to school, and from grade to grade. These transitions are an ongoing process of mutual adaptation by children, their families, schools, teachers, and communities. The record of children's transitional experiences assembled through this study will enable researchers to expand the knowledge base for understanding these critical events in children's lives. Third, a major goal of the ECLSK is to describe student learning and academic progress during the early school years. By closely chronicling the relationship between children's kindergarten experience and their school performance in grades one through five, the study will provide useful information on achievement differences between boys and girls, among minority groups, and among members of different social-economic status groups as children pass through school.

DESIGN NLS-72 was designed to produce representative data at the national level on the cohort of students who were in the 12th grade in 1972.

In addition, the survey obtained high school transcript data on high school curriculum, credit hours in major courses, grade point average, standardized test scores, and related information for each senior. To conduct intensive studies of disadvantaged students, NCES oversampled schools in low-income areas and schools with significant minority enrollments. The size of the student sample was increased during the first followup survey because base year nonrespondents were recontacted at that time.

Anxiety over access to postsecondary and vocational education sharpened the focus on the education experiences of Hispanic and other minority youths. To examine these and other issues, NCES initiated a second longitudinal study, High School and Beyond (HS&B), to complement the first. HS&B studied the high school students of 1980. It attempted to collect the same types of data gathered in the National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972. However, the second study differed from the first in two significant ways. First, it addressed many newer issues of the educational process. Second, it included a sophomore cohort as well as a senior cohort. Adding the sophomore cohort made it possible to study high school dropouts and to analyze changes and processes during high school. The base-year survey of HS&B and the followup surveys have addressed the issues of educational attainment, employment, family formation, personal values, and community activities since 1980. For example, a major study on high school dropouts used HS&B data to demonstrate that a large number of dropouts return to school and earn a high school diploma or an equivalency certificate. Other examples of issues and questions that can be addressed with HS&B data are: How, when, and why do students enroll in postsecondary education institutions? Did those who (while in high school) expected to complete the baccalaureate (BA) degree actually do so? How has the percentage of recent graduates from a given cohort who enter the workforce in their field changed over the past years? What are the medium-term effects of not completing high school in the traditional way? How do employment and earnings event histories of traditional high school graduates differ from those who did not finish high school in the traditional manner? Do individuals who attend college earn more than those who do not attend The survey design provided for a highly stratified national probability sample of over 1,100 secondary schools as the first stage units of selection. To make the study more useful for policy analyses, certain types of schools were oversampled: public schools with a high percentage of Hispanic students, Catholic schools with a high percentage of minority students, alternative public schools, and private schools with high achieving students. The initial national sample for HS&B was considerably larger than that drawn in NLS-72. In this survey, 36 seniors and 36 sophomores were selected in each school. Parents of these students were also sampled. In schools with fewer than 36 students in either of these groups, all eligible students were selected. The base year of this survey, which was conducted early in 1980, collected data from over 28,000 sophomores and 30,000 seniors. The longitudinal design of the study called for followup surveys of substantial subsets of the two cohorts at 2-year intervals. Data collection for the first followup was in spring 1982. Subsequent followups were also undertaken in 1984 and 1986, and another followup of the sophomores was conducted in 1992. The first followup survey conducted in 1982, sampled almost 40,000 students (12,000 seniors and 27,000 sophomores), the second in 1984, sampled approximately 27,000 students (12,000 seniors and 15,000 sophomores), and the third in 1986, sampled almost 27,000 students (also 12,000 seniors and 15,000 sophomores). The 1992 followup collected data from almost 15,000 sophomores. In 1993, a Postsecondary Education Transcript Study was conducted for the sophomore cohort. Data collection instruments in the base-year survey included: Sophomore and senior student questionnaires with a series of cognitive tests; School questionnaires filled out by an official in each participating school; Teacher comment checklists filled out by a teacher of the sampled student; Second language questionnaires; and Parent questionnaires filled out by a sample of parents from both cohorts. The student questionnaires focused on individual and family background, high school experiences, work experiences, and future plans. Cognitive tests administered to students measured both verbal and quantitative abilities. Sophomore tests included brief achievement measures in science, writing, and civics, while seniors were asked to respond to tests measuring abstract and nonverbal abilities. The parent questionnaire elicited information about family attitudes, financial planning, and educational goals. The school questionnaire gathered information about enrollment, staff, educational programs, facilities and services, dropout rates, and special programs for handicapped and disadvantaged students. The teacher comment checklist provided teacher observations on students participating in the survey. The first followup of sophomores provided insights into the school dropout problem and into the influence of the last 2 years of high school on student attitudes and aspirations. The second initial study (NLS-72) laid the groundwork for comparison with HS&B. It recorded the economic and social conditions surrounding high school seniors in that year and, within that context, their hopes and plans. It has since measured the outcomes while also observing the intervening processes. HS&B allows researchers to monitor changes by retaining the same goals, measuring the economic returns of postsecondary education for minorities, and delineating the need for financial aid. By comparing the results of the two studies, researchers can determine how plans and outcomes differ in response to changing conditions or remain the same despite such changes. Additional concerns of HS&B encompass issues that surfaced since NLS-72 began: 'How did the availability (or lack thereof) of student financial aid alter student plans for further education?' and Did middle-income families alter their attitude toward postsecondary education?' These questions, as well as concerns about declining test scores, youth employment, and bilingual education are addressed, along with a host of others."}, {"section_title": "National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988", "text": "The National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88) was the third major longitudinal study sponsored by NCES. The two studies that preceded NELS:88, the National Longitudinal Study of 1972 and High School and Beyond (HS&B) surveyed high school seniors (and sophomores in HS&B) through high school, postsecondary education, and work and family formation experiences. Taken together, the longitudinal studies provide not only measures of educational attainment but also rich resources in determining the reasons for and consequences of academic success and failure. NELS:88 sought to expand on this base of knowledge by following young adolescents starting at an earlier age (eighth grade) and by updating information throughout the 1990s. The longitudinal design of this study permits the examination *of change in young people's lives and the role of schools in promoting growth and positive life outcomes. For example, NELS:88 data can be used to investigate: The transition from elementary to secondary schoolThe survey will permit the investigation of ways students are assigned to curricular programs and courses and how such assignments affect their academic performance as well as future career and postsecondary education choices. The students' academic growth over timeFamily, community, school, and classroom factors that promote such growth can be studied. The goal is to identify school and classroom characteristics and practices that promote student learning. The effects of changing composition of the family, which is evidenced by increasing numbers of working mothers and families headed by single parents, can also be studied. The features of effective schoolsBy surveying students, teachers, and school administrators, NELS:88 enables an assessment of student educational outcomes. It is possible to identify school attributes that are associated with student 100 108 academic achievement and other selected student behavior. For those researchers interested in school effects analyses, NCES also sponsored a School Effects Supplement. In 250 of the NELS:88 schools, additional students and teachers were added in the first followup. The process of dropping out of school, as it occurs from eighth grade on NELS:88 provides the unprecedented opportunity to study young dropouts on a national scale, to examine the contextual factors associated with dropping out (especially those related to the school) and to profile the movement of students in and out of school, including alternative high school programs. The role of the school in helping the disadvantagedGiven the factors of increasing teenage pregnancy rates, increasing poverty among children, and the growing proportion of language minority students, there is a need for research on the school experiences of the disadvantaged and the approaches that hold the greatest potential for assisting them. By design, the NELS:88 sample contains an ample number of disadvantaged students to study this issue. The school experiences and academic performance of language minority studentsNELS:88 oversampled Hispanics and Asians-Pacific Islanders to allow meaningful analyses of these subpopulations. Specifically, the data provide information on variation in achievement levels and bilingual education needs and experiences. Attracting students to the study of mathematics and scienceThe data show the math and science preparation students receive nationwide and the degree to which their interest in these subjects is captured. Information is also available on whether they were encouraged by their teachers and school to study advanced mathematics and science. The transition from high school to college (postsecondary access and choice)NELS:88 included the planning and application behaviors of the high school class of 1992, as well as their subsequent enrollments in postsecondary institutions."}, {"section_title": "102", "text": "1 1 0 Teacher QuestionnaireStudent information: personal characteristics; behavior; academic performance; attitudes; problems; and handicaps.

Because older students, in addition to recent high school graduates, are increasingly included in postsecondary education, high school cohort studies are not representative of all postsecondary participants at a given point in time. BPS includes these \"nontraditional\" as well as \"traditional\" students and is representative of all beginning students in postsecondary education. The BPS survey includes information regarding persistence, progress, and attainment from initial time of entry into postsecondary education, through leaving and entering the workforce. By following a postsecondary education cohort (rather than a single-age elementary or secondary school cohort), BPS describes to what extent, if any, students who start postsecondary education later differ in their progress, persistence, and attainment. Because students who delay entry into postsecondary education have different experiences prior to entry than students who enter immediately after high school, their transitions between levels of education and work may also be different. New BPS cohorts will alternate with the Baccalaureate and Beyond Study in using the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS) as their base. BPS addresses persistence, progress, and attainment after entry into Postsecondary Education. It also directly addresses issues concerning entry into the workforce. Its unique contribution is the inclusion of nontraditional (or older) students. This provides the ability to analyze the differences, if any, between traditional (recent high school graduates) and nontraditional (older) students in aspirations, progress, persistence, and attainment. Among the questions BPS can address related to persistence are: Do students who are parttime or discontinuous attenders have the same educational goals as full-time, consistent attenders? Are they as likely to attain similar educational goals? Are students who change majors more or less likely to persist? The publication, Descriptive Summary of 1989-90 Beginning Postsecondary Students: 5 Years Later, presented rates of persistence and degree attainment. In addition, Nontraditional Undergraduates presented differences in persistence found for traditional and nontraditional students.

It provides both crosssectional information 1 year after bachelor's degree completion (comparable to the Recent College Graduate survey), and longitudinal data concerning entry into and progress through graduation-level education and the workforce. A special emphasis of B&B is on those entering public service areas, particularly teaching. B&B provides information on entry into, persistence and progress through, and completion of graduation-level education. This information has not been available through followups involving high school cohorts or even college entry cohorts, both of which are restricted in the number who actually complete the bachelor's degree and continue their education. This provides a unique opportunity to gather information concerning delayed entry into graduate education, time to completion of graduate education, and the interaction between work and education beyond the bachelor' s degree. B&B is an expansion of the former Recent College Graduates (RCG) Survey. The RCG focused on the immediate post-degree employment and education experiences of people who completed a bachelor's or master's degree, and also estimated the potential supply of newly qualified teachers at the elementary and secondary levels. B&B expands that effort to provide unique information on education and employment experiences over a longer period of time, and addresses issues concerning delayed entry into graduate school, progress and completion of graduation-level education, and undergraduate and graduate debt and its impact on choices related to career and family. In addition, it provides new information on the career paths of new teachers, and movement into and outside of the education system. B&B covers a number of topics of interest to policymakers, educators, and researchers. For example, B&B allows analysis of the participation and progress of recent bachelor's degree completers in the workforce, relationship of employment to degree, income and ability to repay debt, and willingness to enter public service-related fields. B&B also allows analysis of issues related to access and choice into graduate education programs. Here emphasis is on ability, ease, and timing of entrance into graduate school, and attendance-employment patterns, progress, and completion timing once entered. The unique features of B&B allow it to be used to address issues related to undergraduate education as well as post-baccalaureate experiences. For instance, B&B allows the investigation of issues related to undergraduate course-taking patterns, progress, and time to degree. This can involve such things as course taking in the major area of study, as well as in areas other than the academic 115 major; stopout and transfer behavior; credits and grades earned; or financial aid and work experiences as an undergraduate and their relationship to post-baccalaureate education; and financial experiences. This information has been used to investigate the relationship between undergraduate debt burden and early labor force experiences, and between undergraduate academic experiences and entry into teaching. These and other relationships can be investigated both in the short term and over longer periods. Because B&B has a special emphasis on new teachers at the elementary and secondary levels, it can be used to address many issues related to teacher preparation, entry into the profession (e.g., timing and ease of entry), persistence in or defection from teaching, and career movement within the education system. Employment and enrollment patterns can also be examined for special baccalaureate degree populations. These populations include, but are not limited to, students with disabilities, racial and ethnic minorities, students from families with low incomes, and older students. B&B also allows investigation of the experiences of students by major field of study at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. Major fields of particular interest include mathematics, science, engineering, teacher preparation, and health studies."}, {"section_title": "Early Childhood", "text": "An Early Childhood Longitudinal StudyBirth (ECLSB) Cohort Study is being developed. The ECLSB has two purposes: descriptive and analytic. ECLSB will provide descriptive data on a national basis of children's status at birth and at various points thereafter; children's transitions to nonparental child care, early education programs and to school; and their progress during the first 2 years of school, kindergarten, and first grade. ECLSB will also provide a rich data set that will enable researchers to study how a wide range of family, school, community, and individual variables influence children's development, early learning, and their early performance in school. The design of the ECLSB is based on the assumption that children's preparation for school begins at (or before) birth and continues until they enter school for the first time. It is guided by a framework of children's development, care, and schooling that emphasizes the interaction between the child, family, care and education programs, and community. The ECLSB recognizes the importance and interrelatedness of factors that represent the child's health status, social-emotional, and intellectual development. While many decisions about the design of the ECLSB have yet to be made, certain key features of the design have been identified. A nationally representative sample of approximately 10,000 children born during 2000 will be selected for participation in the study. The sample will consist of children from different racial-ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds. Children will be selected at birth and followed through the end of the first grade. NCES has planned for annual data collections. The first data collection will occur shortly after the birth of the child (i.e., within 6 months of birth). The interval between subsequent data collections has not been set. The exact timing of these additional waves of data collection may be affected by other design decisions, the analytic goals of the study, and a variety of operational and cost considerations. The emphasis that is being placed on the whole child and the different environments in which learning occurs is critically important for the design of the ECLSB. While children'sparents will be the primary reporters throughout the life of the study, at varying points it will be necessary to gather data from children's hospital birth records, their care and early education providers, their schools and teachers, and directly from the children themselves. Children will be asked to participate in the study when appropriate for their age in order to limit any negative impacts associated with their participation. Beginning at age two-and-a-half, children will be asked to participate in activities designed to measure important cognitive (e.g., general knowledge, language, and quantitative skills) and noncognitive (e.g., social skills) domains.

There is a great deal of interest in the findings of international student assessment studies and in the development of education indicators that facilitate comparisons among national systems of education. This interest has been spurred by increased concern about global economic competition and the role education plays in the economy. International assessment studies provide answers to the question of how other countries educate their children and with what success. Such comparisons lead to reexamination of our own teaching practices and challenge the conventional wisdom underlying them. The impetus for much of the educational reform movement of the 1980s came from the international comparisons reported in the publication, A Nation at Risk. The assessments not only compare the performance of American students with those of their peers in other nations but also provide insights into the factors that influence performance. OECD educational indicator data provide more comparable information about the activities and outcomes of educational systems and institutions in member countries.

In an effort to provide more complete information on this aspect of the education spectrum, the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) initiated a formal library statistics program in 1989. The first library survey was begun, however, in 1966 with the fielding of the Academic Library Survey as part of the Higher Education General Information Survey. This survey was fielded because academic libraries were considered an essential component of a higher education institution, and the resource that an institution's library represented helped in some ways to define the quality of that institution. The Academic Libraries Survey has evolved into a component of the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, NCES' core postsecondary data collection activity. The first survey under the auspices of the library statistics program (1989) focused on public libraries.

Westat, Inc., has nearly completed geocoding public library service outlets nationwide and digitizing the boundaries of the almost 9,000 public library legal service area jurisdictions. These will be matched to Census Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (TIGER) files and to Public Libraries Survey data files. NCES is considering dissemination options for this resource. One option would be to make it available on the NCES Web site. Another option would be to produce a public use data file linking Public Libraries Survey data with key Census demographic variables and provide a user's guide. A technical report will describe the methods of geocoding, public library mapping, and options for keeping the project up to date. A fast response survey on the topic of public library programming for adults, including adults at risk is under way. The questionnaire is in development and an advisory group will soon be formed to make recommendations concerning the project. Westat, Inc., is conducting the survey. NCES, the National Institute on Postsecondary Education, Libraries, and Lifelong Learning, and the National Library of Education are supporting and/or working on this project."}, {"section_title": "Plans for Crosscutting Activities", "text": "The Library Statistics Program also sponsors activities that cut across all types of libraries. For example, NCES sponsors the attendance of librarians from all sectors at NCES training opportunities, such as the semiannual Cooperative System Fellows Program. In 1999 NCES, with the assistance of Sierra, Inc., is enhancing its library Web site for the six surveys. Information about the surveys has been updated and the Web site is being reorganized. Additional publications are being made available for downloading from the site. There will be links to other Web sites, as well. In addition, library locators will be developed for both the Public Libraries and Academic Libraries Surveys. Customers will be able to locate data about a library in instances where they know some, but not all the identifying information about the library. The NCES World Wide Web site is http://nces.ed.gov. NCES is also developing Web-based peer analysis tools for the Academic Libraries Survey, the Public Libraries Survey, and the State Library Agencies Survey. A basic search will allow the user to search for peers for a particular library using three to five predetermined variables, such as total operating expenditures and population of legal service area. An advanced search will use the same approach, but will allow the user to use additional variables in specifying peers. The expert search can be used when the customer wants to select peers using any combination of user-specified variables from the survey data file. The customer does not have to know the name of a particular library to generate a search. Customer feedback mechanisms will be essential to improving the quality of these products over time and will be built into the Web site. NCES is also working with constituent groups from all the surveys in planning an expanded library statistics cooperative. The goal is to facilitate work on crosscutting issues, without interfering with the ability of existing constituent groups to continue their work in individual surveys. Ideas include expanding participation to add local practitioners, experts from allied professions (such as publishing and technology), more data users, and possibly the media. One advantage of an expanded cooperative will be the opportunity to address crosscutting policy issues, identify and address data gaps, and encourage participation by diverse groups and all levels of government. In 1998, in support of an expanded library statistics cooperative, the American Institutes for Research initiated a review of the content and comparability of NCES' six library surveys. It is hoped that this project will lead to a Web-based matrix covering all six surveys. By topic, the customer would be able to compare definitions across surveys, with possible links to nationwide data across surveys. This activity will be a first step in assessing the potential for a more integrated approach to the library surveys. There will be opportunities to eliminate unnecessary duplication and increase consistency of definitions, which will address key policy issues. General Publications f NCES"}, {"section_title": "142", "text": "The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) annually produces three major publications designed for general audiences: The Condition of Education, Digest of Education Statistics, and Projections of Education Statistics. These publications present statistics on a wide array of education topics. They are used in many diverse ways by policymakers, researchers, and the general public. In addition, NCES produces other topical publications that draw upon a variety of data sources, such as America's Teachers: A Profile of a Profession, 1993-94."}, {"section_title": "The Condition of Education", "text": "NCES gathers and publishes information on the status and progress of education in the United States. The congressional authorization for these activities (with antecedents to 1867) states that the purpose of NCES is to collect collate, and report \"...statistics and information showing the condition and progress of education in the United States and other nations in order to promote and accelerate the improvement of American education\" Section 402 (b) of the National Education Statistics Act of 1994 (20 U.S.C. 9001). In 1975, The Condition of Education was created in response to this mandate. The publication was to present in a single volume an overview of the condition of education in the United States. The format of The Condition of Education was designed to present statistical information in an accessible manner for a general audience. This publication, by analyzing statistical studies and data, investigates the context, resources, and performance of education in this country. In the late 1980s, The Condition of Education became an indicators publication which includes data on a select number of topics of interest and concern in education today. Although not all possible indicators are published in a given edition, 60 indicators are presented in each year' s report. They are divided into six sections: Access, Participation, and Progress; Achievement, Attainment, and Curriculum; Economic and Other Outcomes of Education; Size, Growth, and Output of Educational Institutions; Climate, Classrooms, and Diversity in Educational Institutions; and Human and Financial Resources of Educational Institutions. Supplemental tables and notes are also included. The indicators include a basic core that can be repeated with updated information every year, supplemented by a more limited set of indicators based on periodic or one-time studies. The indicators, therefore, represent a consensus of professional judgment on the most significant national measures of the condition and progress of education at the time, but tempered by the availability of current and valid information. The concept of education indicators has gained the attention of the U.S. Congress, national organizations, states, and localities. To assist NCES in conceptualizing and developing a set of education indicators useful to policymakers and researchers, Congress mandated that NCES convene a special study panel of experts to \"make recommendations concerning the determination of education indicators for study.\" The report of this panel, titled Education Counts: An Indicator System to Monitor the Nation's Educational Health, was submitted to Congress in September 1991. The utility of The Condition of Education should continue to increase as more high quality data become available, especially as new time series can be constructed. Elementary and secondary education data will be enhanced by revisions in the basic data collected about public schools in the Common Core of Data and about private schools from the Private School Survey. The Schools and Staffing Survey and the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 contribute substantially to elementary and secondary education indicators. Assessment data has been enhanced by the National Adult Literacy Survey, the Third International Mathematics and Science Study, and expansion of the Trial State Assessment Program to include science and reading in addition to mathematics, and grade four in addition to grade eight (see chapter 5). An electronic version of The Condition of Education is available on NCES' World Wide Web site (http://nces.ed.gov/pubs/ce/index.html). Short excerpts of The Condition of Education are also published as separate topical reports, addressing such issues as the Social Context of Education and Women in Mathematics and Science."}, {"section_title": "Digest of Education Statistics", "text": "The Digest of Education Statistics is the primary resource publication on education statistics. It contains a wealth of information on all levels of education, from preprimary through graduate education. This reference volume is intended for use by researchers, policy analysts, businesses, media, students, educators, and the general public. The Digest of Education Statistics has expanded through its long history as NCES has pursued a policy of continuous development without sacrificing important trend information. The development of the Digest of Education Statistics occurred over an extended period of time. For 40 years, from 1916-18 to 1956-58, the statistical component of the Office of Education prepared and published the Biennial Survey of Education in the United States. Most of the important data collected by the Office of Education was placed in this survey, which was a resource used by researchers, planners, and others interested in the field of education statistics. After 1958, publication of the survey ceased, but the need for a document summarizing the various types of data collected by the Office of Education continued. Thus, in 1962, the first edition of the Digest of Educaiton Statistics was issued. The 1997 Digest of Educaiton Statstics is the 33rd in this series of publications. (The Digest of Education Statitics has been issued annually except for combined editions for the years 1977-78, 1983-84, and 1985-86.) Its primary purpose is to provide a compilation of statistical information covering the broad field of American education from preprimary through graduate school. The Digest of Education Statistics includes a selection of data from many sources, both government and private, and draws especially on the results of surveys and activities carried out by NCES. It contains a considerable amount of material tabulated exclusively for the publication, such as summaries of federal funds for education and detailed tabulations on degrees conferred by colleges and universities. The publication contains information on schools, teachers, enrollments, graduates, educational attainment, finances, federal funds for education, employment and income of graduates, libraries, and international comparisons of education. Supplemental information on population trends, attitudes on education, education characteristics of the labor force, government finances, and economic trends provide background for evaluating education data. To qualify for inclusion in this publication, material must be nationwide in scope, of high quality, and of current interest and value. The introductory sections supplement the tabular materials in chapters 1 through 7 by providing brief overviews of current trends in American education. Each chapter contains an introduction to the statistical materials describing that sector of education, as well as a brief discussion of the most significant data in the chapter. Charts are provided to further illuminate important data. Recently, NCES has begun a program to make the Digest of Education Statistics even more comprehensive. To make data analysis more convenient, a machine-readable version has been developed. This version of the publication has been expanded to include other NCES publications such as The Condition of Education, Youth Indicators, Projections of Education Statistics, 120 Years of American Education, Education in States and Nations, and State Comparisons of Education Statistics. The data are packaged with software that enables users to search for and retrieve specific data. NCES has also created the Mini-Digest to make basic education statistics available in a pocketsize booklet. The Mini-Digest, which has been published in Spanish, includes statistics on enrollments, expenditures, faculty, degrees, and population characteristics in an abbreviated form. The Digest of Education Statistics strives for clarity, consistency, and comparability. It places high value on the major recurring surveys with the objective of providing national-and state-level data that researchers and policymakers can use to measure changes over time. It seeks to preserve the major series of education statistics originating with NCES and elsewhere and to make them readily available to a wide audience of users."}, {"section_title": "141", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Projections of Education Statistics", "text": "NCES is the official federal source of education projections in the areas of enrollments, graduates and earned degrees conferred, instructional staff, and expenditures in elementary and secondary schools and institutions of higher education. The principal publication dealing with projections, Projections of Education Statistics, provides national statistics about elementary and secondary schools and institutions of higher education. Included are data on enrollments, graduates, degrees, classroom teachers, and expenditures for the past 15 years, and projections for the next 12 years. The report also features state-level projections of public school enrollment and high school graduates. In addition, the report also contains a methodology section that describes models and assumptions used to develop these projections. Most of the projections are based on three alternative sets of assumptions. Although the middle alternative is the preferred set of projections, the other (high and low) alternatives provide a range of possible outcomes. A summary of these projections is available in a pocket-sized folder called Pocket Projections. This brochure is a quick reference for projections of key education statistics. The information provided in the report is used by researchers and policy planners in education and related areas. Projections are targeted for individuals in business, industry, government, the media, and educators whose work requires information on future developments and trends affecting American education."}]
