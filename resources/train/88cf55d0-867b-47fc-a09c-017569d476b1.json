The STEM workforce is a powerful component of this innovation pipeline. STEM occupations employ individuals who create ideas and applications that become commercialized and yield additional jobs. STEM fields overwhelmingly dominate other fields in generating new patents, including those that enter the marketplace. The jobs of the future are integrally STEM driven and the foundation of STEM knowledge student receive has been directly linked to the prosperity of the country. It is through proficiency in these STEM fields that our economic and national security will maintain our competitiveness in this global competition.\nThus, to remain competitive in growing global economies that rely on knowledge and innovation-driven industries, it is imperative that we raise students' achievement and enrolment in STEM related subjects. However, recent international assessment on the Malaysian student's performance in science and mathematics shows that student performance is at low. Malaysia's performance in Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) between1999 to 2011 indicates that student performance has fallen. The results of the 2012 Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) also showed that Malaysia ranked in the bottom third of 65 participating countries, below the international and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) average. Parallel to this, according to Martin et al. (2012) , a total of 18% of Malaysian children have limited prerequisite knowledge and skills in science classrooms; meanwhile, 55% of them had limited prior knowledge in science.\nThe number of student who chooses STEM fields also continues to decline in the recent years. In 2011, only 45% of students graduated were from the Science stream, including technical and vocational programmes (Ministry of Education Malaysia (MOE), 2013)."}, {"section_title": "State of the literature", "text": "\uf0b7 STEM integration can occur in multiple ways.

The enrolments in STEM in upper secondary school level in 2013 were only 35% (29.2% in the pure science stream, 1.3% in the technical stream and 4.5% in the vocational stream (MOE, 2014) .\nThis raises concerns about the education system's ability to produce sufficient STEM graduates for the economy. The National Council for Scientific Research and Development estimates that Malaysia will need 493,830 scientists and engineers by year 2020 (MOE, 2013) . At current speed and course, however, the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MOSTI) (2012) estimate that there will be a shortfall of 236,000 professional in STEM related fields. The current demand for STEM-capable workers surpasses the supply of applicants who have trained for those careers. Given these unmet needs for a STEM-capable workforce, the nation's economic future depends on preparing more students to enter these fields. The declining enrolment in this STEM disciplines is expected to create a shortage of scientists and engineers in the Malaysia workforce in the near future. These figures indicate the need for strong intervention to meet the targeted number of STEM related graduates and to improve future student outcomes.\nPrevious research showed that students' interest towards STEM related subjects is one of the main factor contributed in the declining in the number of students to choose to enrol in STEM related courses (Subotnik et al., 2010) and has been identified in influencing the decision to choose STEM related fields (Riskowski et al., 2009; Sanders, 2009) . Students have lost interest in the domains of science, mathematics, engineering and technology as early as elementary school (before reaching high school) and believe that these areas are not innovative or creative (Marasco & Behjat, 2013) . Research do shows that students start to make decisions about their future careers as early as in middle school (Tai et al., 2006) , and attitudes and interest changes during middle school have the most long lasting effects than any other time of life (Anderman & Maehr, 1994) . Students who indicate that they are interested in pursuing a career in science related field were three times more likely to graduate with a science degree, making career aspirations during middle school an important predictor for STEM professions (Tai et al., 2006) . Many researchers have observed the problem of student becoming uninterested in and unmotivated to learn science at a young age (Swarat et al., 2012) . Students came into school with strong innate interest in science and the decline of their interest stems from the way science is taught (Krajcik, Czerniak, & Berger, 2003) . More alarming, according to MOSTI (2008) , only 44.9% of Malaysians are interested in new science inventions or discoveries. These statistics make quite a compelling case that the Malaysian government needs to do more to reach out to those Malaysians who appear to be indifferent to or uninterested in STEM (MOSTI, 2008) . As such, there is a great need to spark interest among students in STEM, and to develop and facilitate quality STEM learning experiences among them."}, {"section_title": "Integrated STEM Education", "text": "Curriculum integration was grounded in the tenets of constructivism. Satchwell and Loepp (2002) describe an integrated curriculum as one with an explicit assimilation of concepts from more than one discipline. The idea of curriculum integration is derived from educators' awareness that real world problems are not separated into isolate disciplines that are taught in schools (Beane, 1995; Czerniak et al., 1999; Jacobs, 1989) . One of the fundamental problems in schools today is the \"separate subjects\" or \"layer cake\" approach to knowledge and skills (Furner and Kumar 2007) . Often students cannot solve problems because they do not understand the context in which the problems are embedded (Frykholm & Glasson, 2005) . Through curriculum integration, it will provide learning experiences that connect learners' prior knowledge with real world contexts, through integrating meaningful content in real life problem solving setting (Wang et al., 2011) .\nSTEM integration in the classroom is a type of curriculum integration. STEM integration is a curricular approach that combines the concepts of STEM in an interdisciplinary teaching approach (Wang et al., 2011) . The goal of integrated STEM education is to be \"a holistic approach that links the disciplines so the learning becomes connected, focused, meaningful, and relevant to learners\" (Smith & Karr-Kidwell, 2000, p.22) . Laboy-Rush (2011) notes that, \"integrated STEM education programs apply equal attention to the standards and objectives of two or more of the STEM fields\" (p.3). Stohlmann et al. (2012) added that, an effort to combine STEM into one class is based on the connections between the subjects and real world problems. Sanders (2009) argued that the focuses of STEM education should apply knowledge of mathematics, science and engineering, design and conduct experiments, analyze and interpret data, and communicate and corporate with multidisciplinary teams.\nSTEM integration offers students one of the best opportunities to experience learning in a real-world situation, rather than to learn bits and pieces and then to have to assimilate them at a later time (Tsupros, Kohler & Hallinen, 2009 ). The separate-subject approach offers little more than a disconnected and incoherent assortment of facts and skills. There is no unity, no real sence to it all. It is as if in real life, when faced with problems or puzzling situations, we stopped to ask which part is science, which part mathematics, which part art, and so on (Beane, 1995) . Through STEM integration, it will (1) deepen student understanding of each discipline by contextualizing concepts, (2) broaden student understanding of STEM disciplines through exposure to socially and culturally relevant STEM contexts, and (3) increase interest in STEM disciplines by increasing the pathways for students to enter the STEM fields (Moore, 2008) .\nAdditionally, Morrison (2006) provided the criteria for what an effective STEM instruction should look like in a classroom. She suggested in a STEM integration classroom students should be able to perform as 1) problem solvers, 2) innovators, 3) inventors, 4) logical thinkers, and also be able to understand and develop the skills needed for 5) self-reliance and 6) technological literacy. An analysis of different STEM programs and curricula designs revealed that many researchers and educators agreed on the two major foci of STEM integration: (1) problem solving through developing solutions and (2) inquiry (e.g., Clark & Ernst, 2006; Felix & Harris, 2010; Morrison & Bartlett, 2009; Yasar et al., 2006) . Therefore, teaching STEM integration not only needs to focus on content knowledge but also needs to include problem-solving skills and inquiry-based instruction."}, {"section_title": "Effect of Integrated STEM Education on Students' Learning", "text": "Research shows that integrative approaches among science, mathematics, technology and engineering give positive effect on students' learning especially in increasing and improving students' interest and learning in STEM (Becker & Park, 2011) . The integration of STEM in the curriculum will increase student achievement in the disciplines (McBride & Silverman, 1991) . Besides, teaching STEM disciplines through integrating them would be more in line with the nature of STEM. The nature of the work of most STEM professionals blurs the lines between disciplines, thus integrated STEM education can make learning more relevant and meaningful for students (Stohlmann et al., 2013) . It can improve students' attitudes toward STEM subjects, improve higher level thinking skills, and increase achievement (Stohlmann et al., 2013) . STEM learning experiences prepare students for the global economy of the 21 st century (Hynes & Santos, 2007) .\nPrevious research has found that traditional didactic lecture may lead to memorization of factual information, but often fail to elicit comprehension of meaningful learning (Loverude, Kautz & Heron, 2002; Wright et al., 1998) . Meaningful learning occurs when learners make connections between prior knowledge and new experiences and skills within real world contexts (Brooks & Brooks, 1993) . Hirst (1974) pointed out that separated subject areas restricted learning by making learners alienated from real world experiences. Curriculum integration give students more meaningful learning experiences by connecting disciplinary knowledge with personal and real world experiences (Beane, 1995; Capraro & Slough, 2008; Childress, 1996; Jacobs, 1989; Sweller, 1989) . Students stated that lesson content that they perceived as personally \"meaningful\" and interesting are topics that were important in or related to their daily lives (Mitchel, 1993; Palmer, 2009 ). The form of activities (i.e., the use of group work, computers, puzzles) through which learning took place also played an important role in influencing student interest (Palmer, 2009 )."}, {"section_title": "CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK", "text": "STEM integration can occur in multiple ways. It may include different combinations of the STEM disciplines, emphasize one discipline more than other, be presented in a formal, non-formal or informal setting, and involve a range of pedagogical strategies (NAS, 2014) . Additionally, the integration can be such that all content areas are emphasized or one is the focus and the others are used as context to learn disciplinary content. One model suggests that \"integrative\" STEM education must include technological or engineering design as a basic for creating connections to concepts and practices from mathematics or science (or both) (Sanders, 2009 ). Engineering design is the process that engineers use to solve engineering problems and to develop product. It also encapsulates the essence of the engineering profession. Engineering can act as a connector for meaningfully learning the content of mathematics and science . Bryan et al. (2016) stated that, one of the core characteristic of integrated STEM learning experiences include instruction in which the integrator is the engineering practices and engineering design of technologies as the context and/or an intentional component of the content to be learned. They added that the engineering design or engineering practices related to relevant technologies requires the use of scientific and mathematical concepts through design justification.\nEngineering design has been treated as a pedagogical strategy to bridge science and mathematics concepts in use of solving ill-defined (open-ended) problems, developing creative thinking, formulating solutions and making decisions, and considering alternative solutions to meet a variety of constrains (Samsudin et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2011; Yasin et al., 2012) . Engineering requires the use of scientific and mathematical concepts to address the types of ill-structured and open-ended problems that occur in the real world (Sheppard et al., 2009 ). Using engineering design as a context for these problems is a natural way for students to learn through STEM integration. Using engineering contexts as spaces for students to develop real-world representations can be the catalyst for developing related scientific and mathematical concepts through using multiple representations (concrete models, pictures, language, and symbols) and facilitating translations between and among them .\nEngineering design activities in classrooms support an interdisciplinary approach that incorporates knowledge of science, mathematics, and technology (Brophy et al., 2008; Thornburg, 2009) , as well as problem solving, creative thinking, and communication skills (NRC, 2009; Lewis, 2006; Roth, 2001; Thornburg, 2009) . Engineering design activities can motivate students learning of the mathematics and science concepts that make technology possible . Research also provides evidence that integrating engineering design activities into mathematics and science courses benefits students' learning of the content of mathematics and science (Cantrell et al., 2006; NRC, 2009) . Therefore, giving the importance of teaching engineering design in school, given the need to increase the pathways into engineering and the evidence that bridging the STEM disciplines is beneficial for students, it is imperative that students be given the opportunities in school to learn about engineering and participate in engineering design either in their formal, informal or non-formal education.\nHowever, many research on the impact of engineering design in STEM integration focused on upper secondary grades and college years, those for the younger grades appear limited (English & King, 2015) . This could be due partly to the view that design processes are too complex for the younger grades. Thus, given that the bulk of the research has targeted older learners, there is the need for an integrated STEM activities that uses engineering design framework that also takes into account the younger grades to improve students learning especially interest towards STEM, as research has shown that as interest changes during middle school have the most long lasting effects on interest than any other time of life. These years are when students consider future career and academic pathways (Singh, Granville & Dika, 2002) . Students with more confidence in STEM subject are more likely to pursue careers in math and science (Herbert & Stipek, 2005) .\nOne of the most important characteristics of effective science curriculum is early timing and interventions. Interventions should occur prior to high school in order to be effective (Subrahmanyan & Bozonie, 1996) . Thus, for the purpose of this research we use engineering design framework proposed by Museum of Science-Boston (2009) that take into account the younger grades. The application of engineering design process in the module is based on the five cycle as; (1) ask, (2) imagine, (3) create, (4) test, and (5) improve ( Table 1) . The application of STEM content knowledge during the design processes will be the key component of students' learning in solving engineering-based problem. The context of instruction requires solving the real-world problem or task through teamwork."}, {"section_title": "Bitara-STEM: Science of Smart", "text": "Communities is an STEM integrated program that use engineering design process as bridge to connect STEM subjects together.

The first pilot programme was held during June, 2013, serving 65 students. Bitara-STEM programme used project-based activities divided into four separated modules namely Energy, Urban Infrastructure, Transportation, and Wireless Communication. The activities in the modules use engineering design process as a bridge to connect STEM subjects together. Through these activities, engineering design process can act as a catalyst to improve student learning and achievement in science and mathematics by providing a gateway to turn the abstract science and mathematics concepts into concrete real-life applications. At the same time, building an engineering project will also serve as a pedagogical strategy that combines problem solving, creative thinking skills and presentation skills in other STEM subjects. This overall module is given a 5 days ( Table 2) . 35 facilitator (post graduate students) in the fields related to STEM were involved to facilitate students' learning during the programme (17 of them were science and mathematics teachers, 80% of the facilitators hold degrees in science related fields while the remaining was in engineering).

Figure 4 shows the percentages of students according to the level of interest towards STEM subjects and careers on pre and post-test. As described in Figure 4 , both the 2014 and 2015 cohorts of students reported that the percent of students with high level of interest towards STEM career (91.2% and 65.79%, respectively) and subjects (92.8% and 76.32%, respectively) increase after the programme.

Our study has provided an example of how middle secondary school students can engage in processes of engineering design as a context to connect science, mathematics and technology into real world scenario to increase students' interest towards STEM. Overall, the findings of this study have revealed that our participants' interest towards STEM related careers and subjects' increases significantly after participating in the program. Percentages of students with high level of interest towards STEM subjects and STEM careers also increase after participating in the program for both cohorts (Figure 4 ). The findings from two different cohorts show that the ability of the Bitara-STEM: Science of Smart Communities programme to increase the participants' interest towards STEM related subjects and careers were consistence. It is also encouraging to note that, further analysis on students' response categories for both cohorts of students (Table 5, Figure 5 ) indicate that our STEM integration intervention was effective at modifying our participants' level of interest towards STEM related subjects and careers. More than 40% of students from 2014 cohort and 60% of students from 2015 cohort that were at moderate level of interest prior to the program (pre) has shift to high level after the intervention program (post) for both interest towards STEM subjects and careers. The outcomes of this study provide evidence that exposing early secondary to engineering design process in integrated STEM education has positive impact on modifying students with moderate level of interest towards those STEM subjects and related careers. The demography of the participants participates in this programme were student with high achievement in Science and Mathematics subjects in school (Score A in national level assessments -92% (2015) & 97% (2014) in Science and 97% (2015) & 96% (2014) in Mathematics). Thus, it can be concluded that the programme were effective on modifying the high achiever students that have moderate level to shift to high level of interest in STEM related subjects and careers. As reported by Ministry of Educations, the percentage of secondary school students, who met the requirement to study Science after national level examination (named Lower Secondary Assessment) but chose not to do so, increased to approximately 15% (MOE, 2013) . Our finding provides offer one of the possible solutions in overcoming this scenario.\nThe ability of this intervention to significantly influence students' interest towards STEM related subjects and careers may also be attributed to the integrated structure module, which was designed to attend to a wide range of educational needs and student learning. These intervention programmes utilized several promising practices for encouraging student STEM interest. Students participated in hands-on learning activities with clear applications for the real world. They used professional scientific tools, and interacted with STEM professionals (facilitators with degree in engineering and science related background). Students' learning experiences included small group work and collaborative problem solving. Parent involvement was encouraged: parents were invited to attend their child's presentation on a smart city model community as an audience. As the programme was five days long, students' engagement with these \"promising practices\" was more in-depth than that offered by a oneday workshop. Thus, it can be concluded that the experiential features of our programme that provide participants with experience in conducting the integrated STEM activities by themselves appears to be having positive effect on students' affective variables especially in their interest towards STEM related subjects and careers.\nIn general, conducting hands-on activities in STEM related classes is widely recommended by educational authorities. Many hands-on activities offer the potential to positively influence students' interests in the activities (Holstermann et al., 2010) . Practical work, or so-called hands-on experience, is one situational factor that is often assumed to evoke students' interest and to motivate them to learn science (Bergin, 1999) . Most empirical studies provide evidence for the assumption that conducting hands-on activities leads to positive motivational outcomes (Holstermann et al., 2010) . Prior studies indicate that students who participate in hands-on research report improvement in GPA, successful completion of science course, and increased desire to pursue STEM degrees (VanMeter-Adams et al., 2015) . Activities that were \"hands-on\" in nature and those that involved the use of scientific instrument or technology elicited higher interest (Swarat et al., 2012) . A study by Palmer (2009) also found out that student interest was much higher during the experiment and demonstration phase than during the proposal and report phases. Palmer (2009) found that three main sources of interest which are novelty, autonomy, and social involvement. Thus, having students actively participate in authentic activities similar to those in which professionals participate holds great potential for promoting student interest and engagement (Blumenfeld, Kempler, & Krajcik, 2006) . Our study supported this finding, and suggested that this effect is most likely due to the active nature of these integrated STEM instruction as described above. We conclude from this study that well-structured engineering experiences where students were provided with opportunities to engage in the design processes connected to a real-world problem through applying integrated STEM knowledge and skills were effective at increasing their interest towards STEM.\nEven though majority of students that were at high level before the intervention remain at this level after completing the programme, there were also students with high level of interest at the beginning that shift to moderate level after completing the program. This could be due to the experiences that they gain were unable to motivate their learning. As stated by Krapp (2005) , the quality of experience during task completion is also an important factor for the development of students' intrinsic motivation. Interest development will occur if a person experiences his or her actual engagement on the basis of cognitive-rational and emotional evaluations in a positive way (Krapp, 2005) . Therefore, interest will be strengthened when a person experiences a learning activity as enjoyable, pleasant, stimulating and important. Positive emotions such as enjoyment correlated positively with students' interest and intrinsic motivation (Pekrun et al., 2002; Schiefele, 1991) . Experiences that promote positive attitudes could have very beneficial effects on students' interest and their learning (Hofstein & Lunetta, 2003) . Thus, the shift of interest towards STEM to positive or negative could be due to the difference experiences that the students' gain from the programme. Students engaged in challenging academic work, such as project-based learning may categorize into two different patterns. As stated by Meyer et al. (1997) , there were two patterns of student self-perceptions and behaviours in project-based instruction -\"challenge seekers\" and \"challenge avoiders\". Challenge seekers self-reported a tolerance for failure, a learning goal orientation, and a higher than average self-efficacy in math. Challenge avoiders self-reported a higher negative affect after failure, a more performance-focused goal orientation, a lower self-efficacy in math, and greater use of surface strategies (i.e., strategies requiring minimal processing of information). Thus, the differences in the program on changing students interest could also possibly be due to this experiences pattern that students gain from the programme as described by Meyer et al. (1997) ."}, {"section_title": "LIMITATIONS", "text": "However, this study has some limitations. The first limitation was, that the study only involved one group and with small number of participants. Since the design did not include a control or comparison group, it is not possible to attribute the results of this study to the programme alone, nor is the results generalizable. Interpretation of the findings should take into account that the control group does not exist and we are reporting the responders' perceptions. Therefore, this finding suggests that future study could do a two group design with large number of participants. The second limitation was the configuration of our study population. The participants in our study were students with high achiever (students who have strong talent in STEM), and therefore may not be representative of the larger student population. Additional research with a broad selection of student with a wide range of achievement level may be needed to fully substantiate our findings. The limitations of our study provide excellent contexts and directions for future investigation in this line of STEM education research."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "The Bitara-STEM: Science of Smart Communities, an integrated STEM Education programme was developed to increase students' interest towards STEM subjects and STEM related careers. The participants of this programme were revealed to have significant increases in their interest in relation to the interest towards STEM subjects and STEM related career. The major conclusion of this study is that these findings indicate that our short-term non-formal integrated STEM intervention was effective at modifying our participants' interest towards STEM. The increase of mean score of interest and ability to modify students interest has provided an example of how early secondary can engage in processes of engineering design and apply disciplinary knowledge in solving a meaningful an appealing problem. The outcomes of this study provide evidence that exposing early secondary to engineering design process in integrated STEM education has positive impact on their level of interest towards those subjects and related careers. The program was also effective at increasing the student with moderate level of interest to high level of interest towards STEM.\nThese data provide insight that can be influences initiatives for STEM education. Because STEM learning through engineering design in non-formal integrated STEM settings is highly influential as the initial attractors for students with a potential talent in STEM, communitybased programs that create awareness and provide opportunities for those 'magical' encounters with STEM for children and their family members should be strongly encouraged. The ability of a four-day intensive intervention to bring about change in these variables provides the justification for offering these opportunities to students, for our data suggests the experience can be transformative in multiple ways. Students at this age may lack exposure to the career possibilities in the STEM fields and therefore may be making decisions about career choices without accurate information. This study does also support previous finding on the effect of an integrated STEM learning experiences with active learning environment on students' learning.\nFurther research should be studied to explore the reason for those changes. Understanding the factors involved will help further researchers improve and design programs that produce large positive changes on the variables being studied. The long-term effects of this study are also not known. How long the interest in pursuing a STEM careers may remain could be a further investigation. Thus, follow up studies will be done to identify the long-effect of this study in STEM interest. Future studies should also include other sources of data to triangulate the data and strengthen findings."}]
