[{"section_title": "", "text": "On March 11, 2020, the World Health organization declared the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 a global pandemic, reporting community scale transmission world-wide with more than 8 million cases of confirmed corona virus disease (COVID-19). On March 17th, the American Society of Reproductive Medicine provided early key recommendations, updated and affirmed on March 30th, including suspending initiation of new treatment cycles aimed at achieving pregnancy. The European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology provided similar recommendations that expanded even further to include consideration of avoidance of spontaneous conception. These recommendations were made in the infancy of the pandemic when little was known about the implications of the novel coronavirus on implantation and pregnancy. Over the past several months, new developments in molecular virology and immunobiology of SARS-CoV-2 have improved understanding of the novel coronavirus. In light of the rapidly expanding knowledge and realization that care cannot be paused indefinitely, fertility clinics around the world are beginning to resume treatment.\nAs fertility care recommences, the potential impact of SARS-CoV-2 on implantation and early pregnancy is increasingly relevant. Understanding the pathophysiology of the virus and the target tissues at a molecular level can help clarify potential short-and long-term implications of infection on implantation, miscarriage, the intrauterine milieu, the placenta, and pregnancy and neonatal outcomes (1).\nThe genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is similar to, but distinct from the two other coronaviruses, as it has about 80% sequence identity with SARS-CoV and about 50% with MERS-Cov-2. Similar to SARS-CoV, the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 facilitates viral entry into target cells. Entry depends on binding of the S1 subunit of the S protein to a cellular receptor. Multiple studies have also confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 engages angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the entry receptor. In addition, viral entry depends on priming cleavage of the S protein, between S1 and S2 and activating cleavage on S2' site. Depending on virus strains and cell types, proteins may be cleaved by one or several host proteases, including Furin, trypsin, Cathepsins, transmembrane protease serine protease-2 (TMPRSS-2) orTMPRSS-4.\nTo date, the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on endometrial lining and implantation remains largely unknown, therefore the study by Henarejos-Castillo et al. is of utmost importance (5). The authors assessed endometrial susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection by measuring endometrial ACE2, TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4, Cathepsin B and L, FURIN, MX1, and BSG gene expression. The group used public transcriptomic datasets to evaluate the risk of endometrial SARS-CoV-2 infection. Gene expression data from 5 studies including 112 women with normal endometrial pathology was used to characterize receptor expression throughout the menstrual cycle. The study population included 29 samples in the proliferative phase, 29 samples in early secretory phase, 43 in the medium secretory phase, and 8 in the late secretory phase. A relative expression value of low, medium, and high expression was established. The thresholds correspond to 1% -10%, 11% -50% and 51% -100% categories of gene expression values of the entire integrated dataset.\nThe authors reported high expression of TMPRSS4, Cathepsin B and L, FURIN, MX1, and BSG throughout the menstrual cycle. Notably, ACE2 expression was found to be low, and TMPRSS2 was moderately expressed throughout the menstrual cycle. Expression of viral proteins showed significant changes at different stages of the cycle except for TMPRSS2 which remained relatively constant. Overall, all genes showed increased expression during the early secretory to mid-secretory phase. The authors also reported a positive correlation in ACE2 and TMPRSS4 expression during the early secretory phase as well as a weak but positive correlation in ACE2, TMPRSS4, and CTSL expression during the window of implantation. The group also found a positive correlation between age and expression of most viral genes including ACE2, TMPRSS4, CTSL and CTSB at different stages of the menstrual cycle suggesting that older women may be at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 endometrial infection.\nOverall, the findings of this study are reassuring and suggest low risk of endometrial infection by SARS-CoV-2. However, low expression of ACE2, the major cell surface receptor used by SARS-Cov-2 does not exclude the risk of endometrial infection since other proteases like TMPRSS4, CTSL, CTSB and FURIN which show high expression during certain periods of the menstrual cycle. However, it is important to note that none of the highly expressed proteases reported in this study are known to initiate SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nThe authors accurately point to several limitations in the study. Because the data is extracted from existing datasets, the inclusion criteria for the selected studies may not represent the population contemplating conception or fertility treatment, and the reliability of the reported results is dependent on the quality of the initial studies. In addition, the genetic profile of individuals may vary depending on age, ethnicity, medication use, and underlying medical conditions such as endometriosis. The results of this study may not be generalizable to patients considering conception. As the authors suggest, the endometrial genetic profile changes throughout the menstrual cycle; true risk of infection may primarily depend on protein expression during the window of implantation. Additionally, the suggestion that ACE2 expression increases with age is not quantified clinically. What is the degree of increase? Does this increase reflect a clinical risk? The small sample size used for the age-related analysis should also be taken into account.\nIn conclusion, existing evidence suggests that expression of SARS-CoV-2 infection-related genes varies with age and menstrual cycle phase, with ACE 2 expression increasing with female age. Overall, the endometrium appears to have low susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection due to low ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression; this susceptibility could vary depending on viral cell entry"}]
