It contributes to all stages of the conservation and management cycle from identifying conservation needs to evaluating conservation actions ( fig. 1). Started in 1966, in the United States and Canada, in response to growing concerns about the health of bird populations and the effects of pesticides and other threats (see Appendix 1 for brief overview and history of the BBS), the survey engages thousands of skilled volunteer birders and professional biologists every year to collect data on the status of bird populations across the continent using a rigorous, standardized survey protocol. In 2008, the BBS program expanded into northern Mexico with the goal of providing avian population status information for those regions. This dataset is unparalleled in North America in its temporal and geographic scope and the breadth of species covered ( fig. 2). More than 150,000 point counts are conducted annually to provide the population data needed for management and conservation decisions.  As of 2020, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Canadian Wildlife Service (CWS), Partners in Flight, the North American Bird Conservation Initiative (NABCI), and State and provincial wildlife agencies all rely on the BBS to inform avian conservation priorities. For most bird species, cutting-edge analyses of these data continue to provide some of the most reliable information used to identify species of conservation concern and candidates for listing under the Species at Risk Act (Canada) and the Endangered Species Act (United States), as well as aid in evaluating species recoveries. Species-group analyses of BBS data presented in the State of the Birds reports (for example, NABCI-Canada, 2019; NABCI-U.S., 2019; note: BBS data from Mexico have not been published) have highlighted ongoing conservation concerns for North American birds and the health of the ecosystems that support them ( fig. 3). Today, more than 800 scientific and conservation-based articles utilizing BBS information have been published, and researchers continue to find new applications of the data to inform emerging issues beyond tracking population trends ( fig. 4). Most recently, BBS data have revealed, through the development of innovative analytical methods, the startling finding that North America has lost nearly 3 billion birds over the past half-century. BBS data were essential for the analysis of 82 percent of 529 species assessed in this study documenting declines and increases (Rosenberg and others, 2019;fig. 5). The BBS is widely used and integrated into North American conservation efforts. Nevertheless, it is at a pivotal moment in its history, with opportunities existing that would allow the program to take full advantage of its invaluable dataset. Accomplishing the goals in this strategic plan will mean that the BBS program will fill geographic gaps, leverage new technologies to expand the applications of its data, have the resources to meet the needs and expectations of stakeholders, and meet its mandate as a publicly supported program. To accomplish the far-reaching goals set out in this document, this program needs to strengthen its core governmental support and reach beyond its traditional organizational structure by developing strong partnerships. This unique, long-standing program was built upon a strong science foun-     "}, {"section_title": "Vision", "text": "To be the authoritative source of information on longterm change in North American bird populations and widely used in management and conservation."}, {"section_title": "Mission", "text": "To inform avian conservation and management efforts by collecting data on breeding bird populations across North America using a variety of standardized protocols and delivering scientifically credible measures of the status, trends, and environmental associations of birds at multiple geographic scales, in collaboration with partners."}, {"section_title": "Strategic Goals and Objectives", "text": "This Strategic Plan includes three main goals, each containing strategic objectives, followed by a short rationale."}, {"section_title": "Goal 1. Enhance the BBS program to better support the collection of standardized data through robust, design-based methods, and the analysis of scientifically credible trend estimates of, and spatial models depicting, North American bird populations at continental and regional scales.", "text": "Strategic Objective 1A. Upgrade the program's electronic data management systems to increase efficiency in the collection, management, and delivery of BBS bird population and point count-level spatial data; to facilitate integration of new data collection protocols within the BBS program; and to maximize the value of BBS data for spatial modeling and other relevant applications."}, {"section_title": "Rationale.", "text": "The continued success of the BBS program relies on the integrity of the BBS electronic infrastructure and availability of the 95-million-record database, which continues to grow by about 2 million bird records each year. In addition, the precise locations where the 50 point counts were conducted in each year along BBS routes are currently unavailable and, in many cases, unknown. New digital tools and data management systems need to be adopted to enable the streamlined entry of bird data, the annual collection and management of geographic coordinate data, and the dissemination of these data. Countlevel geographic information is key to the integration of BBS data with compatible avian, environmental, and land-cover data ( fig. 6), as well as with the incorporation of new protocols into the BBS program itself. Geospatial information is also becoming increasingly important for accurately estimating population sizes, investigating the causes of population change related to habitat change and other drivers, and allowing for more accurate spatial modeling. Ensuring and improving the continued seamless collection, management, and delivery of BBS data are critical for North American bird conservation and management efforts. Strategic Objective 1B. Develop and implement additional standardized survey protocols that are compatible with the current protocol to fill priority gaps in geographic coverage. Rationale. Current BBS coverage, though extensive, has some significant geographic gaps that affect inferences regarding regional and continental population trends. These gaps include remote areas where there are few roads and (or) participants, for example, boreal and Arctic regions, montane areas, and most of Mexico. Thanks to modern analytical techniques and innovative, standardized data collection protocols, we now have novel methods to incorporate BBS data with other complementary data. Filling these geographic gaps in coverage will "}, {"section_title": "Strategic Goals and Objectives 7", "text": "Loxia curvirostra (Red Crossbill), Photo by Jonathan Irons improve our ability to produce credible estimates of population trends and sizes that span the gaps, address regional conservation issues, and ensure that inferences based on BBS data are truly continental. Strategic Objective 1C. Ensure that the BBS achieves its mission by having sufficient observer participation to support existing geographic coverage as well as expanded coverage. Rationale. The BBS observer base, a network of thousands of participants, requires constant recruitment to maintain current levels of coverage. Filling priority gaps will require an even larger pool of volunteers. Also, over the last decade, organizations like the Cornell Lab of Ornithology have redefined birders' expectations regarding ease of data entry and mapping through novel applications, like eBird. Partnerships with existing avian organizations (for example, Cornell Lab of Ornithology, Audubon, and others) can provide an unprecedented opportunity to recruit new participants and streamline data entry through the use of existing web and mobile applications. Enhanced support and engagement of current and future BBS participants, the lifeblood of the BBS, are critical to the continuity of the program."}, {"section_title": "Strategic Objective 1D", "text": ". Continue to advance model development to estimate population trends, species distributions, and abundance through time and space, including approaches for integrating complementary data from other sources, through credible, well-documented analyses, to better meet the needs of the bird conservation and management communities. Rationale. New statistical approaches are being developed that can integrate data from multiple sources, better address potential sources of bias, and provide more precise estimates of bird population change. The incorporation of new statistical methods into BBS analyses needs to be well justified, rigorously evaluated, and peer-reviewed to maintain the credibility of the program. Goal 2. Ensure that BBS data and analytical products are highly accessible and are widely recognized as the definitive source of information on changes in North American bird populations, owing to their scientific rigor, utility, and visual appeal. Strategic Objective 2A. Consistently make BBS data, including current and historical count-level data, and analytical products easily and publicly available, and improve their transparency, utility, quality, and visual appeal to ensure their continued relevance for bird conservation and management. Rationale. Stakeholder and public expectations continue to evolve and grow, creating a demand for new products beyond the impressive breadth of available BBS products. Users also require timely and open access to BBS data, models, analytical codes, and results; a lack of transparency or delays in delivery undermine the credibility of the program. The availability of modern data-management and visualization tools represents an opportunity for the BBS program to release its data and products efficiently and allow users to easily find the results they seek. BBS data need to be made available through straightforward, efficient, and reliable data platforms to ensure that they remain highly relevant to stakeholders, increase the program's overall impact and user base, so that it achieves its mission as a publicly supported program. Strategic Objective 2B. Increase support for the BBS program and use of its products by improving brand recognition and perceived credibility among policymakers, administrators, and the public through clear, effective, and engaging communication. Rationale. Despite the longevity of the BBS program, segments of the birding community and relevant government agencies remain unaware of the BBS, its unique position as a publicly funded program, and its critical role in North American bird management and conservation. This lingering obscurity leaves the BBS vulnerable to shrinking budgets and the intense marketing and outreach efforts of other programs when competing for resources. In addition to clearly understanding the bird conservation management needs of decisionmakers and working towards high priority goals which the BBS can support, the program needs to communicate in a more engaging way to ensure that the credibility of the BBS program is maintained, the value and quality of the BBS's products are recognized and used to their fullest extent, and the BBS brand is known. More effective marketing is necessary for the program to garner the support needed to meet its strategic objectives. Rationale. The standardized, 50-plus-year BBS dataset is unparalleled and continues to grow by more than 2 million records annually. Because of this growth, as well as rapidly evolving information technology, continued program delivery requires additional investment. The BBS requires core government resources to maintain program coordination, continue professional data analyses, ensure timely and accessible delivery of data and products, and meet changing stakeholder needs. Additional resources will allow the BBS to continue to meet its goals of providing annual population data on more than 600 bird species, thereby supporting the mandates of the U.S. Department of the Interior and Environment and Climate Change Canada. Strategic Objective 3B. Building on Strategic Objective 3A, develop strong partnerships with other organizations, to achieve Goals 1 and 2. Rationale. Other Federal agencies with management responsibilities for migratory birds have not always been fully engaged with the BBS program. Furthermore, additional resources beyond the scope of government support are required to implement the suite of actions detailed in this Strategic Plan. Other Federal and non-Federal organizations may have the capacity to assist the BBS with several facets of program delivery, such as data and information management, communication, and (or) marketing. They may also offer a different and (or) more varied volunteer base. Building partnerships will improve the quality of BBS data products and the manner in which they are served to the conservation and management communities. The participation of other organizations may also help reinvigorate the program and increase efficiencies in a resource-stressed environment."}]
