[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Precision agriculture technologies (PATs) offer an approach to arable systems which both enhance productivity and minimise environmental harm. Despite expected economic gains uptake by farmers has been low. This paper explores the intended adoption of PATs through a survey of 971 farmers growing wheat, potato and cotton in five European countries. We apply a count data modelling framework to accommodate the inherent structural differences between the current adopters and non-adopters of PATs. This is augmented by qualitative analysis of the main thematic reasons for intended uptake. Results indicate non-adopters have more belief in their knowledge of field topology and are generally older than current adopters. Those non-adopters intending to adopt PATs in the future are more favourable to a wider range of incentives than current adopters. Attitudinal differences towards the economic certainty of investment and payback periods also emerge. The results indicate that a gradient of adoption is occurring within European arable farming systems which may lead to inequalities in technology access. Recognition of these differences at policy level could lead to cost-effective interventions which maximise uptake, generate returns to candidate farmers and meet policy desires for sustainable agricultural production in the future."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Precision agricultural technologies (PATs) are a set of technologies aimed at the management of spatial and temporal variability. Optimal operation of PATs could potentially increase on-farm profitability, optimize yield and quality, reduce inputs and minimise environmental impacts (Godwin et al., 2003; Robertson et al., 2007 Robertson et al., , 2009 Silva et al., 2011; Aubert et al., 2012; Zhang and Kovacs, 2012; van der Wal et al., 2017; Smith et al., 2013; Eory et al., 2015; Schimmelpfennig, 2016) . Under the constraint of limited land for agricultural production in the future (Beddington et al., 2012; Tilman et al., 2011) , a range of policy documents support the uptake of PATs (Crookston, 2006; Zarco-Tejada et al., 2014; Schrijver et al., 2016) . These documents infer that precision agricultural technologies are a key pathway for the future of commercial agriculture and support the sustainable intensification of agricultural systems (Gebbers and Adamchuck, 2010; Telabpour et al., 2015) .\nFarmers are beginning to embrace these technologies and a dialogue is maturing towards the opportunities for both harvesting significant data from sensor technology and for allied services offering interpretation of these data (Kerry et al., 2017; Sylvester-Bradley et al., 2017) . Thus, PATs pose a potential disruption in demand for, and the skills of, farm management and labour (Schimmelpfennig, 2016) which may also affect the identity of the farmer from one of a land manager to farm technician (Tsouvalis et al., 2000) . Accordingly, a growing wealth of research has examined the behavioural and structural characteristics of PAT-adopting farmers. Barriers relate to prohibitive costs of these technologies (Fernandez-Cornejo et al., 2001; Lawson et al., 2011; Cullen et al., 2013; Faber and Hoppe, 2013; Schimmelpfennig, 2016) , and also the uncertainty of outcomes limiting the ability to adequately identify the return on investment of different technologies (Robertson et al., 2007; Montalvo, 2008) . A number of studies have also found low levels of trust in the technology which negatively affects uptake (Bogdanski, 2012; Eidt et al., 2012; Busse et al., 2014) .\nThe institutional context and in particular, the incentive structure for PATs have been under-explored in the literature on PAT adoption. The uncertainties found within the farming community towards PATs, compared to the potential societal gains from their adoption, challenges policy makers to design interventions which encourage their uptake. The purpose of this paper is to address these gaps by examining a range of incentives that may influence the intention to adopt PATs. We explore this through a large cross-country survey of technology intentions within European arable farmers. Adoption of PATs within Europe is diverse across regions, with some countries typified by more intensive cropping activities. However, uptake in the European Union (EU) is lower compared to US or Australian systems ."}, {"section_title": "Methodology", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data collection", "text": "A survey was conducted between August 2016 and February 2017 across five European countries (i.e., UK, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and Greece). These countries were chosen to represent a diversity of different structural factors (e.g., in terms of farm size and intensity of production) and adoption rates. The sample was targeted at farmers and farm managers that were cultivating wheat, the crop most widely cultivated in Europe (Eurostat, 2015) and/or potatoes, a high value crop, with a high economic output per ha per year in the 2015/ 2016 cropping season. In Greece, cotton farmers were surveyed as a replacement for potatoes, because cotton is extensively grown throughout the country and PATs are mainly used in cotton production (Markinos et al., 2003; Gemtos et al., 2004 Gemtos et al., , 2006 Balafoutis et al., 2017b) .\nFarmers were selected across equal strata based on their level of either non-adoption, or adoption of PATs. This approach was employed because of the lack of representative databases on PAT uptake within the EU region. Farmers were contacted through trade fairs, machine dealers, agricultural databases and personal contacts. They were selected on the basis of current non-adoption and current adoption of PATs. Once selected, farmers were interviewed mostly face to face, with a small number interviewed by telephone due to availability. Completed responses were estimated against Eurostat size and income data with each of the five countries and found to representative across these variables.\nFarmers were presented with a suite of 8 common technologies which are currently available to farmers. These are shown in Table 1 in terms of what we refer to as threshold technologies, namely technologies that are required before further adoption of variable rate technologies can be achieved (Schimmelpfennig and Ebel, 2016; Balafoutis et al., 2017a,b) . This latter set of technologies are identified as 'contingent', namely farmers can only adopt these discrete technologies if they intend to adopt or have currently adopted a threshold technology first 1 . As the focus of this paper is on farmer intentions to adopt, the count data were assembled to reflect a farmer's status with respect to the threshold technologies and their intended status with respect to contingent technologies. Specifically, non-adopters were defined as farmers with no current or future intention to adopt threshold technologies (0) or those who intend to or currently adopt threshold technologies (1). Then the number of contingent technologies were summed for each individual. Fig. 1 , shows the counts following these rules for all farmers within the sample."}, {"section_title": "Modelling approach", "text": "A count regression modelling approach was applied as the technologies represent count outcomes for the individual farms (Isgin et al., 2008; Paxton et al., 2011; Castle et al., 2016) . Within the suite of poisson models the zero inflated count model regression structure allows non-adopters to be considered through a different data generation process to the current adopters. The approach accommodates two latent groups, namely those who are always non-adopters (i.e. current adoption and future adoption intentions are null, referred to as 'always 0') because of structural barriers, and those which are current non-adopters but are able to adopt in the future, referred to as 'not always 0'. The predicted count outcome (Y i ), with z i as a vector of explanatory variables for the 'always 0' group (y i = 0) outcomes and x i a vector of explanatory variables for the 'not always 0' group (y i > 0) can be written as:\n(1 ) 0\nwhere (\u03c8) is the probability of the logistic distribution. The zero inflated regression has two parts. A count model, which is applied to those adopting the technology, explains the factors influencing the intention to adopt the PATs, and a binary model, which is applied to non-adopters (n = 249), explains the threshold between non-adoption and intention to adopt PATs."}, {"section_title": "Explanatory variables", "text": "Socio-economic and structural variables are fairly common within the PAT adoption literature with studies finding that size and financial ability, through higher incomes, drives uptake (Fernandez-Cornejo et al., 2001; Olsen and Elisabeth, 2003; Griffin and Lowenberg-DeBoer, 2005; Robertson et al., 2012) . We accommodate various dimensions of these structural variables ( Table 2) .\nThe statements identifying potential incentives for more intended adoption were developed initially between the researchers and the European Union Joint Research Centre policy team. These were then refined after discussion with a small number of industry representatives and from piloting the survey within each region. These statements covered financial incentives, e.g. \"a 10% reduction in the present cost of the technology\"; government interventions, e.g. \"directed subsidy support for uptake of PATs\", \"more stringent laws on pesticide and nitrogen application\"; informational incentives, e.g. \"improving technology to provide working maps based on soil maps\", and training support incentives \"more technical support from sales people\". These incentives were presented against a three point scale, from the incentive having no effect on uptake, a probable effect on uptake and a definite effect on uptake.\nVery few studies explicitly explore attitudes towards uptake of PATs, aside from the farmer's lack of trust in the technology (Montalvo, 2008) . The statement \"Investing in precision agriculture has too long a payback for the business\" reflected the financial constraints to adoption and \"I am too uncertain of the effects of PAT to invest in it\" to identify farmer confidence in the technology. Moreover, it may be that size of farm is only a perceived barrier rather than a physical barrier to uptake (Fernandez-Cornejo et al., 2001 ). Therefore we included the attitudinal question \"My farm is too small to invest in PAT\". Finally, a lack of compatibility between technology devices was identified by the statement \"My current machinery does not support the technology\" as this has been A. Barnes et al. Environmental Science and Policy 93 (2019) 66-74 raised by a number of studies (e.g. Stafford, 2000) .

Qualitative responses were translated by the authors into English and then reviewed using thematic analysis to identify the common themes emerging from sub-strata of responses around intentions for adoption (Guest et al., 2012) . These were grouped using categories of nonadoption and adoption with the aim of understanding thematic reasons for their intended behaviour towards PAT adoption."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "A likelihood ratio test found the ZIP favourable over the ZeroInflated Negative Binomial (ZINB) (LR= 27.53 (p = 0.000) ), and had a lower BIC value (zip = 3010.176, zinb = 3112.239). Collinearity between variables was assessed using Variance Inflation Factors (VIF) for the regressors and all variables were between 1.37-3.12 with a mean VIF of 2.30. This is well within the recommended parameters for low collinearity (Kutner et al., 2004) .

We focus the discussion on odds ratios as these provide indications of the likelihood of factors which would lead to uptake of more precision agricultural technologies for the adopters or the likelihood of nonadoption of PATs in the non-adoption model.

Respondents are more likely, by a factor of 1.04, to adopt more PATs than those without an agricultural education. Size and income indicators have no significant effect on intended adoption within the current adopters model. Accordingly whilst adoption may be contingent on size and income characteristics, it is a less prevalent characteristic for further adoption. This relates to the positive response found for training of staff for the technology. This is mostly reflective of the larger size of the current adopters compared to non-adopters, as this group would be expected to have more regular labour concerned with the day to day running of the arable enterprises.\nFor those intending to adopt more technologies, the incentive that will have an effect on adoption is more regulation on agrochemical application (IREG). This may indicate awareness that these technologies lead to reduced inputs, as it relates to environmental quality. Moreover, it may be linked to Government regulation seeking ways to increase N-use efficiency (Guillem and Barnes, 2013; Barnes et al., 2013) . It may also be reflective of resistance found by some producers towards regulation, where technologies have been adopted which were considered appropriate for the farm and only further adoption will occur if farmers are obliged to, through more restrictive regulations .\nOf the attitudinal variables, only the statement 'I am too uncertain of the effects to invest in it' proved significant with odds less than 1, i.e. more certainty of the outcome would lead to more uptake of PATs. This would seem to agree with a number of previous studies which found the higher levels of trust assigned to a technology leads to more PAT uptake (Bogdanski, 2012; Eidt et al., 2012; Montalvo, 2008) .\nIn terms of influencing adoption of PATs, the use of advisors increases the odds of more PATs, whereas farmer-to-farmer interactions and contractors do not prove significant. This may reflect the knowledge gap, identified by Busse et al. (2014) , in that advisors provide a supporting role for encouraging adoption. Moreover, Feder et al. (1985) identified both farmer extension and field demonstration as important factors in the diffusion of innovation. This may be required for current adopters to ensure that the PAT fits the farm's current technological structure. The role of farmer-to-farmer discussion is also a potential source of information (Rogers, 2003; Propokny et al., 2008) , but this may not be applicable to PATs, as these technologies are technically advanced and have a high cost of implementation."}, {"section_title": "Intentions to adopt by current non-adopters", "text": "The non-adopter model shows the odds of the independent variables influencing the intention to not adopt PATs. A farmer over 65 has increased odds of intended non-adoption of PATs by a factor of 4.7. The PAT adoption literature tends to equate younger farmers with those more likely to adopt newer technologies (Lambert et al., 2015) . The PATs available to these farmers are technically advanced and require a level of engagement and interaction to act upon the results. This engagement may appeal to younger farmers who are more exposed, as a generation, to information technology solutions, compared to the assurity towards the field's heterogeneity observed in older farmers.\nAnother common finding is related to size proxies and larger farms are more likely to adopt PATs (Fernandez-Cornejo et al., 2001; Castle et al., 2016; Schimmelpfennig, 2016) . The odds ratios below 1 confirm this, i.e. large farms are less likely to be non-adopters compared to smaller farms. This is further confirmed by the significant attitudinal variable of perceptions towards the size of farm (SIZEFARM). This generates odds ratios over 1 and indicates that a farmer in strong agreement to this statement would tend towards non-adoption.\nSize is normally coupled with an income measure (INC) which is also below 1 and leads to a general view that the larger farms with more household income are more likely to intend to adopt PATs than smaller farms with lower household incomes. This result also relates to the one attitudinal statement, namely 'Investing in precision agriculture has too long a payback for the business' (ECONATT) which is significant. This is a negative statement reflecting economic confidence towards an expected rate of return and farmers who are in agreement would be more likely to remain non-adopters. A further significant attitude statement relates to a perception that the current machinery on the farm does not support the technology. There is also some compulsion to 'lock-in' or inhibit further adoption through the non-standardization of data formats and transfer protocols across manufacturers (Stafford, 2000) . Consequently, this result seems to be reflective of the lack of complementarity between different manufacturer's technologies.\nFinally, there is a difference between the effects of incentives on the non-adopters compared to the adopters. The incentives which would lead to producers being more likley to intend to adopt PATS are around government support \"Directed subsidy support for uptake of PATs\" (ISUB), and \"Government support for soil mapping, by providing ground penetrating radar or intensive soil sampling\" (IRAD) and training support \"More support for training for myself and family\" (IFAM), as well as 'More technical support from sales people' (ISUPP). This is in contrast to a strong opinion that \"More support for training of my staff\" (ILAB) would contribute to producers being less likely to intend to adopt PATs. This may be due to returns to training costs of the family, which can be internalised into savings for a farming household, as they represent long-term Reference class for dummy variables in brackets. \u0278 p. * 0.05, ** 0.01,*** 0.001.\nA.

In addition, \"Financial support from tax breaks\" (ITAX) would also contribute to less liklihood of intention to adopt PATs, as this is perhaps reflecting the smaller asset base of these farmers."}, {"section_title": "Qualitative analysis", "text": "To understand differing perceptions towards adoption and nonadoption qualitative responses were grouped into i) non-adopters, farmers with no technologies currently adopted or intention to be adopted, ii) threshold farmers, those farmers who only intend to adopt machine guidance or controlled traffic farming devices, iii) low level adopters, those farmers who intend to adopt less than 3 PATs, and iv) high level adopters, those farmers who intend to adopt 3 or more PATs. For these latter two classes we follow Miller at al. (2017) who identified intensive adopters as those with three or more bundles. The responses were coded into common fields and are shown below in terms of the frequency by which statements were given for each of these categories."}, {"section_title": "Non-adopters", "text": "For this group the main concerns were around farm physical constraints. Specifically they believed that PATs require larger fields to use these technologies and therefore did not consider their current farming structure appropriate for adoption (Table 4) . They also highlighted no need for replacement of their machinery and this, in conjunction with the near retirement status of some farmers, shaped their views towards the technology. What also emerged from the group was a belief in their own knowledge of the fields and their ability to farm their fields adequately without technological aids, for example one German farmer stated:\n'I do not see the benefits, I can drive myself straight' (Farmer DE884) Moreover, a UK farmer stated 'I'm not convinced that it's delivering reduced costs \u2026 Our combine is all laser guided off the header, having a machinery guidance means the only difference is it's using a satellite instead of the laser to guide it so I don't see the point.' (Farmer UK550)"}, {"section_title": "Threshold technology adopters", "text": "A common reason mentioned by this group was the need to reduce agro-chemical inputs, which is also reflected by statements focused on increasing efficiency and reducing costs (Table 5) . Hence, whilst some of the response to adoption of PATs could be related to the requirement to engage in environmental behaviours (e.g. Siebert et al., 2006) , this seems to be mostly related to profitability concerns, where environmental benefits are secondary for these farmers. Whilst return on investment (ROI) was raised, some farmers identified a scepticism towards an adequate economic return. For instance a farmer from the Netherlands stated:\n\"there is insufficient belief in return on investment\" (Farmer NL99)\nThere was also awareness of how imprecision currently exists within the PATs available if input costs rise. A UK farmer stated: \"as cost of chemicals and fertilizer increases more precision will be needed.\" (Farmer UK 419)."}, {"section_title": "Low level adopters", "text": "Statements promoted for adoption were the greater reduction in the cost of the technology (Table 6 ). This relates to the market structures for PATs and accessibility of these technologies within rural economies. Ultimately, access is driven by coverage of a small number, or in some cases only one, dealer. Moreover, the desire for more accuracy and precision was highlighted which may be contrasted to the observation of McBratney et al. (2005) that most assessments of PATs are at a single field scale and generally reflect experimental conditions. Given the heterogeneity of fields the scaling up of benefits are driven by uncertainties which will ultimately affect the payoff from investment (Lawson et al., 2011) .\nRelated to this a number of farmers argued that adoption would be engendered by more than a 10% reduction in the cost of the technology. Cost is a common barrier found in previous studies of adoption and clearly links to wider findings of size being an inhibiting factor for adoption. The stated need for more information around the benefits can be considered in parallel to concerns around understanding the applicability of the PATs on the diversity of farming systems, and the needs for both a proven benefit and a higher return on investment to induce more PAT uptake. A Netherlands farmer vocalised the need for more applied information as:\n\"thorough implementation research into the effect on yield; correct prescription maps based on field measurements\" (Farmer N505)\nIn addition, farmers sought some assurity of non-biased research that could be provided by non-industry funded research. A Greek and A. Barnes et al. Environmental Science and Policy 93 (2019) \"scientific proof of returns on investment\" (Farmer GR128) \"proven independent testing\" (Farmer UK618)"}, {"section_title": "High level adoption", "text": "Cost issues were also prevalent within high level adopters as well as the desire for more accuracy, and ease of use (Table 7) . Preferences for this group were identified as the need for more technology development and harmonisation between equipment manufacturers, which reflects their technology facing approach to farming: A small number of current high adopters identified their motive was driven by curiosity or they perceived themselves as progressive farmers. They felt PATs were simply part of an inevitable shift in the development of agricultural production and therefore they were required to adopt this technology:\n'...we need to move with the times' (Farmer DE902) 'Progress and effectiveness, we must move with the times' (Farmer DE780) Standardisation and improved product quality were also mentioned, specifically the desire to create some uniformity in production given the variance in soils and the ability to plough straighter lines. This would allow more standardisation in production and improved product quality:\n'to try and even everything out, we have variable soil and with the applications we can even out harvest dates' (Farmer UK34) 'It was to even out variation across ground to make more uniformed crops, better targeting of problem areas.'(Farmer UK178) 'To try and even out yields across the fields.' (Farmer UK52) This knowledge of spatial variability has been found to be a factor in driving adoption (Isgin et al., 2008; Khanna, 2001) as the reduction of input use is greater when low variability exists. Furthermore, this may allude to Burton (2004) observation around cultural capital/recognition within farming and that the presentation of uniformity is reflective of being seen as a 'good farmer'. This offers a further distinction between current and intended adoption within these arable farming systems."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Precision agricultural technologies offer an attractive panacea for policy makers who express the desire for sustainable food production under future land and climatic pressures. Previous studies have mostly focused either on what drives adoption of PATs or the farm level cost impacts of adopting PATs. As far as we are aware no study has focused on the incentives that would encourage further adoption and this paper addresses this gap to inform this growing dialogue.\nWhat emerges are differences dependent on the level of adoption choices of farmers. Effectively the decision to firstly adopt PATs can be influenced by a wider set of incentives than those currently adopting PATs. This infers different populations operating within agriculture. Barnes et al. (2011) argue that these populations dictate engagement strategies as they are driven by different perspectives that shape the framing of solutions to these distinct communities. Moreover, from a policy perspective engaging particular communities would influence the cost-effectiveness of interventions within the sector. Those nonadopters who have expressed no intention to adopt in the future tend to display a stronger belief in their own knowledge, a cynicism towards the technology, or a perception of structural constraints, in terms of land topography and size, which cannot be overcome by application of PATs. These are smaller farms with limited resources to invest. This leads to issues around equity and access to these technologies which, whilst small areas of land are managed, offer havens for maximising social returns as they are usually vulnerable household farms with diverse enterprises. This diversity in land quality will create a further barrier to uptake and inevitably leads to polarities and inequalities for the technological trajectories of farming communities (Chandra et al., 2017) .\nThe issue of low income farmers raise fundamental questions over the role of the public sector in supporting uptake of PATs. Given ambitions within Europe to reduce reliance on agrochemical inputs there is an argument for intervention as this would promote the protection and maintenance of natural capital. Whilst there seems to be a desire to encourage uptake there is no direct regulatory push to adopt PATs in the EU. Moreover European agricultural policy has instruments, such as support for modernization of tractors, which could be more aligned with support for PATs. Schrijver et al. (2016) show the diffuse nature of the policy landscape needed to encourage uptake of PATs. These involve telecommunications regulations, data access legislation and data transfer protocols. Developing cohesion between technologies, policies and infrastructure would seem a particularly challenging, yet pertinent, problem for engendering a significant uplift in PAT adoption. More indirect drivers, through tightening of the EU Nitrates Directive (Monteny, 2001) , may encourage some farmers to use agronomic measures or technologies, such as variable rate nitrogen applicators. Similarly, if policy is shifting towards rewarding public goods creation (Helm, 2017) then payment mechanisms may incentivise the machinery for collecting environmental data for basing payment rates.\nA further issue is the lack of consolidation between manufacturer's systems for allowing progressive adoption of PAT bundles. Hence, a potential role for Government is to promote standardisation of systems through legal infrastructure and R&D support. It could, therefore, be further argued that the role of the Government is to provide a balance to industry promotion of these technologies, by offering demonstration, support for training and, if these benefits are economically or environmentally justified (e.g. to meet GHG reduction targets), potential subsidization for smaller farmers to engage in precision agricultural technologies on farm.\nWe find differences in attitudes towards the technology. Non- adopters with no intention of adopting perceive PAT to have too long a payback, adopters not wishing to invest further are more uncertain of the outcomes. Evaluation of the true economic benefits and return to investment is complicated by the application in diverse contexts. Castle et al. (2016) and Schimmelpfennig (2016) find that economic returns are dependent on farm related factors and vary due to the technology itself, the farm size and whether regular labour are currently employed on the land. There may be a further case for provision of regional field trials, demonstrating technologies in these diverse contexts. This approach may provide more assurances of the performance of the technology within localised circumstances or, conversely, serve to dissuade farmers as limitations emerge.\nThe qualitative analysis shows a diversity of responses, both positive and negative, to the technologies. One clear point of dissonance is the lack of a belief that the technology is somehow superior to a farmer's own knowledge for a number of non-adopting farmers. This reflects some of the arguments forwarded by Tsouvalis et al. (2000) towards 'yield mapping' which they saw as an example of 'technology push' and not developed in sympathy for the farmer needs. They argued for more co-creation of technologies and this would seem to be a pertinent avenue for future research studies.\nOn the margins of qualitative statements more intriguing reasons emerge for non-adoption, in that it is seen as a challenge to the ecological principles of some farmers. This latter reason potentially highlights the issues of farming identity. Other pathways such as agroecology or integrated farm management could run counter to the use of PAT which has so far been aligned with intensifying systems. This may also create barriers to low-input or organic farmers who could benefit from adoption of PATs but are deterred by this technological approach. Indeed, more ecological farming solutions tend to 'break up' present fields, which provides the main argument towards the need for a precision approach. The literature is lacking in qualitative studies of uptake of precision agriculture and further work should examine the role of these cultural factors and how sophisticated technologies, such as PATs, may create barriers to future adoption.\nIn addition, we address sequential adoption through our approach of discriminating between 'threshold' and 'contingent' technologies. More detailed understanding of progressive adoption of PATs would require longitudinal data sets, such as USDA's Agricultural Resource Management Survey (Miller et al., 2017; Schimmelpfennig and Ebel, 2016) . A similar publically available adoption database does not exist for European farming systems as far as we are aware, but this would prove valuable in developing metrics and understanding the progression of adoption highlighted here."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "A range of financial and non-financial incentives would increase adoption of PATs. The main barriers to intended adoption focus on the high cost element of the initial investment, leading to longer payback periods and limiting returns due to the economic carrying capacity of the farm. Moreover, uncertainty towards the potential for improved profitability to recoup this investment creates a significant barrier towards further adoption.\nFor farmers not currently using PATs, adoption could be realised by providing technical support or training as farmers seem to view these incentives positively. For those farmers already using PATs, regulatory pushes appear to determine willingness to further adopt PATs, indicating higher awareness of the roles these technologies can play in meeting compliance with tighter environmental rules, or reflecting a capacity for addressing regulatory barriers. This extends wider than direct agricultural regulation to other regulatory and infrastructural frameworks, most pertinently technological interventions to overcome limits in rural broadband coverage and the supporting data analytical services."}, {"section_title": "Disclaimer", "text": "The views expressed in this document are purely those of the authors and may not in any circumstances be regarded as stating an official position of the European Commission.\n1.

The basic idea is that, according to an electronic map or sensors, a control system calculates the input needs of the soil or plants and transfers the information to a controller, which delivers the input to the location."}, {"section_title": "Controlled Traffic Farming", "text": "Controlled Traffic Farming (CTF) is a system which confines all machinery loads to the least possible area of permanent traffic lanes. Current farming systems allow machines to run at random over the land, potentially causing compaction on a large part of the field. CTF can reduce tracking surface, and thus compaction, to just 15% of the field area. The permanent traffic lanes are normally parallel to each other. CTF allows optimised driving patterns and more efficient operations (i.e. reduced overlaps). As all operations are aligned, input applications can be targeted very precisely relative to the crop rows.\n4 Variable Rate Irrigation Variable rate irrigation (VRI) systems (also called precision irrigation systems) customise water application based on the crop's needs, derived from mapped topography information, soil data maps, prior yield data, and information about the crop's status. This can, for example, be achieved by pulsing sprinklers or boom sections on and off and/or controlling the system speed to modify the application depth along the length of the irrigator. VRI uses GPS technology and the control systems which can be easily retrofitted onto uniform sprinkler systems."}, {"section_title": "Variable Rate Pesticide Application", "text": "Variable rate pesticide application technologies enable changes in the application rate to match actual or potential pest stress in the field and avoid application to undesired areas of the field or plant canopies. They can also significantly reduce spray overlap. Current commercial applications focus on herbicide spraying.\nOne type of VR pesticide application adjusts the application rate based on a prescription map. Using the field position from a GPS receiver and a prescription map of desired rate, the input concentration is changed as the applicator moves through the field.\nThe other type of VR pesticide application is based on a real-time sensor, which controls the application rate based on the current situation of pest stress or canopy characteristics, without the generation of a prescription map. These systems involve either contact (e.g. mechanical) or non-contact (e.g. camera) sensing to identify either pests that need to be controlled or the crop and foliage/canopy that needs to be protected.\n6 Variable Rate Seeding/Planting Variable rate planters/seeders modify the rate of planting and seeding during application. This is often accomplished by disconnecting the planting/seeding system from the ground drive wheel, which normally keeps the planting/seeding rate constant when the speed of the tractor varies. By driving the planting/seeding system with an independent engine, gear box or hydraulic drive, the planting/seeding rate can be adjusted to the local soil potential. Besides being used for varying seed density, the technology of VRA seeding is also used to eliminate double planting in headlands and point rows.\nThe planting map is based on information like soil map, topography, irrigation, and long-term yield history. A GPS system and a seeder/ planter equipped with a suitable control mechanism are also required for the system. 7 Precision Physical Weeding Precision physical weeding technologies enable changes in the configuration of mechanical weeders or weed burners (e.g. in the position of or the resistance exerted by the tines of a harrow or the flow rate of the fuel) during weeding, to match weed presence and/or density in the field. The challenge of physical weeding is to obtain a high degree of selective weed control without producing considerable crop damage as a result of weeding. The technology is still in an experimental phase."}]
