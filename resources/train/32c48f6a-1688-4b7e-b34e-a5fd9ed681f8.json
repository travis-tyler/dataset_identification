[{"section_title": "", "text": "shown that vestibular function declines with age. [1][2][3][4] The vestibular system is known for its role in maintaining balance and postural control, and several studies have noted associations between vestibular loss and balance impairment and falls in older individuals. [5][6][7] Increasing evidence demonstrates important connections between the vestibular system and various domains of cognitive function, most notably visuospatial ability, but also memory, executive function, and attention. [8][9][10][11] Studies in animals and individuals with unilateral or bilateral vestibular loss suggest that the vestibular system provides critical information about spatial orientation, spatial memory, and spatial navigation. [10][11][12][13] Visuospatial ability deteriorates with age. Studies have shown that older individuals have greater difficulty with navigation in real-world and virtual environments. Older adults make more errors in returning to their starting locations and have greater difficulty remembering locations of previously observed targets. [14][15][16][17] In addition, perception of subjective visual vertical also appears to degrade with age, with greater deviations from true vertical observed in healthy older than younger adults. 18 It is unknown whether vestibular loss associated with age plays a role in the degradation of these critical spatial cognitive functions in elderly adults. This link may be important to establish, given that declines in spatial orientation and navigation may mediate the association between age-related vestibular loss and falls. The current study used data from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) to evaluate the cross-sectional association between vestibular function and selected domains of cognitive function, including visuospatial ability, memory, executive function, and attention. The function of the saccule, the vestibular end organ responsible for measuring changes in spatial orientation with respect to gravity, was specifically considered. Based on the existing literature, it was hypothesized that vestibular function would have the strongest association with visuospatial ability. A series of structural equation models was developed to evaluate the extent to which vestibular function may mediate age-related changes in cognition. These analyses offer insight into the mechanisms by which peripheral vestibular sensitivity may be associated with specific cognitive functions and may inform future research on preventive and treatment strategies for age-related cognitive decline."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study Participants", "text": "The BLSA is a prospective cohort study of participant volunteers aged 21 to 103 in the National Institute on Aging Clinical Research Unit at Harbor Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland.

The majority of participants had more than a college education. With respect to cardiovascular risk factors, 38% of participants reported a positive smoking history, 47% reported hypertension, and 17% reported diabetes mellitus (Table 1). Mean logMAR visual acuity with corrective lenses was 0.05 \u00b1.13, corresponding to a visual acuity between 20/20 and 20/25. The mean PTA hearing threshold was 27 \u00b1 14 dB. The mean performance of the study sample on each of the cognitive tests was also evaluated ( Table 2). One participant had a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment and another of dementia. Excluding these two participants did not affect the results, so both were included in the analyses reported below. The association between vestibular function and specific domains of cognitive function was evaluated using two multivariate linear regression models. Model 1 included age, sex, race, and education, and Model 2 added cardiovascular risk factors, vision, and hearing. To facilitate interpretation, the model coefficients were transformed such that a negative coefficient always indicated that poorer vestibular function was associated with poorer cognitive function. Significant associations were found between vestibular function and performance on Card Rotations, Purdue Pegboard, BVRT, and TMT B in Models 1 and 2 (Table 3). Vestibular function was significantly associated with MMSE score in Model 2 but not Model 1. Specifically, in Model 2, each 1-\u03bcV lower rectified cVEMP amplitude was associated with a 11.5 lower Card Rotations score (P = .001), a 0.35-peg lower Purdue Pegboard score (P = .005), 1.11 more errors on the BVRT (P = .008), a 6.09-second slower TMT B time (P = .04), and a 0.32-point lower MMSE score (P = .03). Vestibular function was not significantly associated with memory tests, specifically poorer vestibular function was not associated with fewer recalled items on the immediate total (P = .07) and delayed recall (P = .05) portions of the CVLT. Tests of executive function (Backward Digit Span, Category and Letter Fluency), tests of attention (Forward Digit Span, DSST), and TMT A were not significantly associated with vestibular function (Table 3). See Online Appendix S1 for coefficients and P-values of other covariates in Models 1 and 2. To assess the magnitude of difference in cognitive performance associated with poorer vestibular function, the difference in chronological age that would be equivalent to 1-\u03bcV lower cVEMP amplitude was estimated. The visuospatial cognitive tests that were significantly associated with age and vestibular function were considered for this analysis. A 1-\u03bcV lower cVEMP amplitude was equivalent to 8.5 additional years of age for performance on the Card Rotations test, an additional 3.5 years for the Purdue Pegboard test (mean), 10 years on the BVRT, and 6.7 years on the TMT B.  Figure 1A), 11% of the association between age and TMT B time ( Figure 1B), 12% of the association between age and BVRT errors ( Figure 1C), and 5% of the association between age and Purdue Pegboard score ( Figure 1D). The sample sizes used to test each of these models differed (N = 136 for Card Rotations test, N = 104 for TMT B, N = 133 for BVRT, N = 117 for Purdue Pegboard test). Finally, exploratory factor analysis was used to identify latent cognitive abilities that underlie performance on the various cognitive tests. Only 73 individuals had complete data on all cognitive outcomes and contributed to the factor analysis. There was no significant difference between individuals with and without complete cognitive data in any demographic or cognitive measure with the exception of the Category Fluency test, on which scores were better in individuals with missing data than those with complete data (P = .02) (Online Appendix S2). Three factors were identified based on the parallel test. Based on the loading structure of the cognitive measures onto these three factors, the factors were defined as visuospatial ability, verbal memory, and working memory and attention. (For loadings see Online Appendix S3.) The visuospatial factor was significantly associated with cVEMP amplitude in Model 1 (P = .02) but not Model 2 (P = .15). The verbal memory factor was not significantly associated with cVEMP amplitude in either model. The working memory and attention factor was not significantly associated with cVEMP amplitude in Model 1 (P = .09) but was significantly associated in Model 2 (P = .02) ( Table 3)."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "These analyses offer compelling evidence of a cross-sectional association between vestibular and cognitive function. Vestibular function was associated with cognitive tests of visuospatial ability. This finding is consistent with an emerging literature showing that impairment in visuospatial tasks such as spatial navigation and spatial memory co-occurs with vestibular disorders, although the specific tests used in the BLSA differed from those used in prior studies. 10,11,31 This study extends these prior observations of cognitive impairment in individuals with specific vestibular disorders and suggests that vestibular loss associated with aging may contribute to age-related variation in cognitive function. Findings from the factor analyses suggest that vestibular function may be associated with working memory and attentional function in addition to visuospatial ability. The mechanism by which vestibular dysfunction is associated with cognitive dysfunction is unclear, although several potential pathways have been hypothesized. Loss of peripheral vestibular input may lead to atrophy of areas within the cortical vestibular network, including the \"head direction cells\" within the thalamus, subiculum, and entorhinal cortex; the temporoparietal junction; and the part of the hippocampus that contains \"place cells.\" 12,32,33 Substantial convergence with visual streams of information occurs in these cortical sites, specifically in the hippocampus and medial superior temporal area. [34][35][36] A study of 10 individuals with bilateral vestibular failure found that they developed significant hippocampal atrophy and associated impairments in visuospatial tasks such as navigation in a virtual maze. 10 Another study in 22 individuals with bilateral vestibular loss found decreases in functional connectivity of temporoparietal junction structures critical for visuospatial processing and the rest of the brain. 37 The association between vestibular and cognitive dysfunction may also relate to the influence of the vestibular system on working memory and attentional processes. A significant association was found in factor analyses between vestibular function and the working memory and attention factor, which chiefly included the Forward and Backward Digit Span tasks, which are tests of short-term memory. Studies in animals suggest that vestibular input is critical for spatial working memory, which is the short-term storage of spatial information for use in ongoing cognitive tasks. 38,39 Spatial working memory centers are thought to reside in the hippocampus and the basal ganglia, and important vestibularstriatal connections are beginning to be recognized. 40 A final mechanism that may link vestibular and cognitive function is common risk factors such as microvascular disease and hyperglycemia. The current study attempted to adjust for these potential confounding factors, although residual confounding cannot be definitively excluded. In these analyses, the function of the saccule, the vestibular end organ that detects tilting of the head with respect to gravity, was specifically considered. Although the literature on the contribution of each of the vestibular end organs to cognitive function is sparse, studies suggest that the saccule may play a preeminent role in spatial cognition. In mice, animals with congenitally absent saccular function exhibit a head tilt phenotype. 39 These mutant mice have been shown to have poorer ability to navigate through a radial maze than their wild-type counterparts. Functional magnetic resonance imaging studies of saccular stimulation in humans have shown activation of a broad cortical network, including the intraparietal sulcus, the temporoparietal junction, the paracentral lobule, and the cingulate cortex. 41,42 Electroencephalographic studies in humans demonstrate that stimulation of the saccule through sound-evoked VEMPs activates a similar array of cortical structures, including the operculum and insular cortex around the temporoparietal junction. 43 Saccular function is assessed routinely with the cVEMP as part of the standard battery of clinical vestibular tests, which also includes electronystagmography and caloric testing. Interventions to treat saccular dysfunction are lacking, largely because of the underrecognition of the importance of this organ. This study underscores the salience of the saccule to critical functions such as spatial cognition. If these observations are confirmed in a longitudinal analysis, it is possible that developing therapies to remediate saccular function may ameliorate the cognitive decline that many aging individuals experience. Limitations of this study include the cross-sectional nature of the analyses, which cannot support causal inferences. The effects of confounding variables have been minimized by adjusting for potential predictors of cognitive dysfunction, including age, sex, race, educational level, visual acuity, hearing function, and cardiovascular risk factors in the analyses. Moreover, a causal association between loss of vestibular sensitivity and cognitive decline may be more plausible than the reverse, although recent work suggests bidirectional interactions whereby the cognitive state can influence vestibular responsivity. 44 Additionally, almost one-quarter of participants had absent cVEMP responses and were not included in the analyses. These individuals were significantly older than participants with present responses, consistent with prior literature showing increasing loss of cVEMP responses with age. 45 Exclusion of older individuals with greater levels of cognitive impairment may have led to an underestimate of effect sizes in this study. Furthermore, the sample size did not permit stratified analyses to evaluate potential effect modification of the association between vestibular and cognitive function, for example according to sex or race. Finally, less than half of the entire sample was included in factor analyses, given that only participants who completed all cognitive tests were included. Although participants with complete data did not differ substantially on demographic, clinical, or cognitive measures from those with missing data, the findings from the factor analyses need to be interpreted with caution given the smaller analytical sample. A significant association was found between vestibular function and specific domains of cognitive function related to visuospatial ability and perhaps working memory and attention. Moreover, it was demonstrated that vestibular function is an important mediator of the association between age and cognitive decline. These findings have potentially profound public health implications, given the widespread and devastating effects of age-related cognitive decline on affected individuals and society. It has been hypothesized that vestibular loss contributes to the onset of Alzheimer's disease, 46 and a small study of 25 older adults observed a weak association between vestibular dysfunction and topographical memory impairment, one of the earliest signs of Alzheimer's disease. 47 Deterioration of visuospatial ability in older individuals may contribute to important geriatric outcomes such as falls, unintentional injury, inability to perform activities of daily living, and loss of independence. Future studies will need to establish whether mitigating age-related decline in peripheral vestibular sensitivity will forestall these highly morbid and costly outcomes.  "}]
