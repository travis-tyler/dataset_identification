[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Coronavirus is one of the most infectious pathogens that targets human respiratory system. In patients have no symptoms but they act as a carrier for the diseases. About 80% of infected people recover without any special treatment and approximately 1.0 out of 6.0 patients is seriously ill and facing breathing difficulty [5] . People having weak immunity, diabetes, heart problem, and are infected with coronavirus, need extra attention and clinical care [6] .\nCOVID-19 spread from person to person through small droplets, when infected person cough, exhale or speaks. This is why it is important to keep distance of at least 3 to 6 feet from a person who is ill [5] . On 11th March 2020, WHO declared COVID-19 as a pandemic disease [7] . All the country are doing their best and implementing the appropriate control and preventive strategies. In the absence of specific medicines for treatment of COVID-19, drugs that might be effective include remdesivir, ritonavir, chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) alone or in combination with covalescent plasma, monoclonal antibodies and Interferons [8, 9, 10, 11, 12] . Many efforts have been made to develop vaccine against CoV infection but there are certain limiting factors such as degree of cross-protection and their sequence diversity which prevent the development of suitable and effective vaccine J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f [13] . According to WHO guideline, the infected patients must be provide with proper oxygen therapy, fluid therapy, medicine and also recommends proper isolation system."}, {"section_title": "Structure and origin of Coronavirus", "text": "Coronavirus are enveloped virus, with single stranded, non-segmented, positive sense RNA belongs to the family Coronaviridae, subfamily Coronavirinae and order Nidovirales.\nGenome size of coronavirus is approximately 26-32 Kb and is the largest known genome of RNA virus [14] . Its size ranges from 60 nm to 140 nm in diameter having club-shaped spike projections (Fig 1) . Under electron microscope, spike looks like crown and hence named coronavirus [15] . Coronavirus have helically symmetrically nucleocapsids, which is very rare among positive sense RNA virus. On the basis of phylogeny, subfamily Coronavirinae consist of four genera: Alphacoronavirus (\u03b1-CoV), Betacoronavirus (\u03b2-CoV),\nGammacoronavirus (\u03b3-CoV) and Deltacoronavirus (\u03b4-CoV).\n\u03b1 -CoV and \u03b2 -CoV usually causes respiratory problems in human, whereas \u03b3 -CoV and \u03b4 -CoV infect birds. In human two highly pathogenic viruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, causes severe respiratory syndrome, whereas four human coronavirus HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E and HKU1 induced mild respiratory syndrome in immunocompetent person. According to current sequence database HCoV-OC43, HKU1 have originated from rodent and HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have originated from bats [14, 16] . Through sequencing, it was found that nCoV-2019 belongs to \u03b2 -coronavirus [17] . China. This outbreak in China is the third epidemic in 21 st century, which already surpassed SARS and MERS. Currently, large number of pneumonia patients were reported, who had exposed to seafood market, which is a hub for many species of live animal. In January 10, 2020, full genome sequences of COVID-19 were released in public database, and were found that sequence has some similarity with SARS. 2019-nCoV was renamed as SARS-CoV-2 by\nInternational Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. Genetic sequence of COVID-19 shows more than 80% similarity with SARS-CoV and 50% sequence identity with MERS-CoV [21] .\nExtensive study from the phylogenetic analysis revealed that the COVID-19 belongs to betacoronavirus genus. Binding of receptor is the first step of viral infection followed by fusion with the cell. It is reported that COVID-19 binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), as the sequence of receptor binding domain of coronavirus spikes is similar to that of SARS-CoV [22] . in third trimester of pregnancy and confirmed for COVID-19 infection, but the transmission from mother to child was not confirmed. Pregnant women are more susceptible to infection by respiratory pathogens [24] ."}, {"section_title": "Symptoms and Diagnosis", "text": "The "}, {"section_title": "Vaccine and Plasma Therapy", "text": "S-protein based strategies such as S1 receptor binding domain (S1-RBD), DNA, viral vector, full length S protein etc. have been used for developing vaccine against COVID-19 [39, 40, 41] . S1-RBD interact with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and S2 domain of S protein mediate fusion of virus and host cell membrane for releasing viral RNA into the cytoplasm. The S protein plays a major role for induction of immunity during COVID-19\ninfection, which elicits antibodies and T-cell response [38] . Hence the S-protein based vaccine blocks not only viral binding receptor but also prevent viral genome uncoating [42] .\nTherefore full length or may be the appropriate part of S protein are most promising (Table 2) ."}, {"section_title": "Convalescent plasma transfusion (CPT) is an immune based treatment against COVID-19.", "text": "Plasma from the patients recovered from COVID-19 has been potent and last resort to increase the survival rate of COVID-19 patients [45] . Several studies shows shorter hospital stay and decreased mortality in patients who are treated with plasma than those who are not treated with plasma. This technology was also previously used in case of MERS, 2009 pandemic influenza A H1N1 or in 2014 against Ebola virus disease [46, 47] . Recently it has been suggested by Food and Drug Administration that administration of CPT may provide an effective treatment against COVID-19 during public health emergency [48] . According to WHO, COVID-19 management is primarily focus on preventing infection transmission, early detection and proper health care support system.\nThere are some limitation such as along with CPT patients receive antiviral drug, thus there is a possibility that these antiviral drugs may also contribute in the recovery of patients. Some patients also administered with glucocorticoids, which might interfere with immune response. \u2022 Individual with respiratory symptoms, advised to meet medical health care for proper treatment.\n\u2022 Regular hand wash with disinfection or soap and use of alcohol (at least 70%) based sanitizer.\n\u2022 Use of face mask, and avoid direct contact with infected person.\n\u2022 Safe distance of at least 1 meter should be maintained.\n\u2022 Health care are recommended to use N95 mask and FFPE kit while handling suspected or confirmed cases of coronavirus.\n\u2022 Avoid touching nose, eye and mouth without proper hand sanitization.\n\u2022 Patients with pre-existing medical condition such as diabetes, asthma, heart disease etc. may continuously be in contact with their medical supervisor."}, {"section_title": "Effect of COVID-19 on global GDP", "text": "Global economy will suffer the worst financial crisis, said the International Monetary Fund as the planet is struggling with the COVID-19 pandemic.
