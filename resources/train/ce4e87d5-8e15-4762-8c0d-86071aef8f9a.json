[{"section_title": "The Salaries of Ph.D.'s in Academe and Elsewhere", "text": "Albert Rees I t has long been known that Ph.D.'s working for academic institutions earn less than Ph.D.'s in the same disciplines working for other kinds of employers, especially government and industry (Freeman, 1971). It has not been possible to tell, however, whether this difference in earnings represents a difference in average quality of the employees in the two sectors or whether it represents a compensating differential reflecting the greater autonomy and freedom from control of superiors in the academic sector, and the greater job security of tenured professors. It is now possible to answer this question through the use of special tabulations of data from the Survey of Doctoral Recipients of the National Research Council (1989). 1 Although the concept of compensating differentials (though not the term) goes back to Adam Smith, surprisingly few studies have successfully measured the size of compensating differentials. This study adds to that small set. "}, {"section_title": "Data Sources and Definitions", "text": "The data used in this paper are from the 1985 and 1987 Surveys of Doctorate Recipients. These are sample surveys where the overall 1987 sampling rate was about 13 percent for scientists and engineers and about 16 percent for those with doctorates in the humanities. 2 Those with doctorates in education and professional fields are excluded. The resulting sample covered approximately 65,200 scientists and engineers (including social scientists) and 16,000 humanists. Of these, about 37,000 scientists and engineers (57 percent) and 9000 humanists (56 percent) responded. Much of this paper deals with salary change between the two years. Estimates of changes in salary are based on individuals who were in the sample and responded in both years, who make up somewhat less than half the number of respondents in 1987. In this paper, the academic sector is defined as four-year colleges and universities, and medical schools. This sector employed exactly half of the employed scientists and engineers in 1987. Business and industry, including self-employment accounted for 31.4 percent, the federal government 6.6 percent, hospitals and clinics for 2.9 percent, and state and local government 2.2 percent. Another 2.2 percent were in two-year colleges and primary or secondary schools (National Science Foundation, 1989). The holders of doctorates in the humanities are more concentrated in the academic sector, which employed 73.0 percent of them in 1987. Not all Ph.D.'s in the academic sector are engaged in teaching. For scientists and engineers in 1987, only 49 percent of those employed by academic institutions report teaching as their primary work activity. For 34 percent research and development is the primary work activity, and 11 percent are in management or administration. Among humanists, teaching is the primary work activity for 64 percent of those employed in all sectors combined. As most readers of this article know, most members of college and university faculties are paid on an academic year basis (nine or ten months). The salary data in the Survey of Doctorate Recipients adjust academic year salaries to a full-year basis by multiplying them by 11/9ths. This may seem to be an overadjustment, since some faculty members would like summer employment at full salary and cannot find it. On the other hand, the adjustment does not take into account sources of earned income other than summer employment. Data from the U.S. Department of Education suggest that these factors are roughly offsetting on average. For all faculty in higher education in Fall 1987, including those who do not have the doctorate, summer salary and other extra income from the employing institution plus outside earned income are 23.4 percent of basic salary, which is just over 2/9ths (Chronicle of Higher  , 1977, -87 Education, 1990. I assume that people employed in government and industry do not in general have similar opportunities to earn extra income. The adjustment of academic year salaries to a full-year basis may not be equally appropriate in all fields. Natural scientists and engineers are more likely to have research grants or contracts that provide summer salary and more likely to have consulting income than are humanists. Table 1 shows the estimated median salary of full-time employed doctoral scientists and engineers by sector of employment for the three largest sectors from 1977 to 1987. Even after academic year salaries have been multiplied by 11/9ths, the salaries in the academic sector are consistently below those in federal government and industry. Federal government salaries are roughly equal to those in industry until 1981, after which they fall behind. Similar historical data are not published for doctorates in the humanities. However, in 1987, the estimated median salaries of humanities doctorates in higher education and in industry were identical, while that in government was slightly lower (National Research Council, 1989, Table 16)."}, {"section_title": "Salary Differences by Sector of Employment", "text": "The data given above combine doctoral scientists of different ages and in different fields of study. Differences in the distributions by age and field in different kinds of employment could give rise to differences in the median salary. Table 2 shows median salaries by age and field of doctorate for those employed in the academic and nonacademic sectors. Academic salaries are below nonacademic salaries in all but three of the 32 cells. The exceptions are psychologists and humanists over age 50 and all humanists. Somewhat Table 2 Median Salary of Full-time Employed Doctorate Recipients by Degree Field, Age, and Employment Sector, 1987 surprisingly, the differences tend to be larger for the youngest Ph.D.'s; that is to say, salaries rise more with age for academics than for nonacademics. 3"}, {"section_title": "Salaries of Movers and Stayers", "text": "To distinguish between the possible explanations for salary differences between the academic and nonacademic sectors, we turn to an analysis of the salaries of movers and stayers. Table 3 shows the change in the median salary from 1985 to 1987 by mobility status. The first three columns cover those who were in the academic sector in 1985. They are divided into three groups by status in 1987: those in the same academic institution, those who stayed in the sector but moved to a different academic institution, and those who moved to the nonacademic sector. The last two columns cover those who were in the nonacademic sector in 1985. It is not possible for this group to identify those who stayed with the same employer. They are therefore divided into those who stayed in the nonacademic sector and those who moved to the academic sector. Because we are dealing with exactly the same individuals in the two years, we have a complete implicit control for all aspects of quality and other individual characteristics that do not change over a two-year period. In other words, these are what is now known in the economics literature as fixed-effect estimates. Table 3 tells a very clear story. Of those who started in the academic sector, those who moved generally had a larger increase in median salary than those who stayed put. This is not always true for those who moved within the sector; in environmental sciences and in engineering the within-sector movers had a smaller median increase than the stayers. For those who changed sector, however, the change in median salary was always larger than that for the other two groups, and often by very substantial amounts. In other words, the bulk of the gain to those in the third column of the table was from changing sectors, and not simply from changing employers. For those who started in the nonacademic sector, the story is just the reverse. Those who stayed within the sector had consistently a more favorable change in median salary than those who moved to the academic sector. In many cases, the differences are very substantial, and in the social sciences movers actually had a decline in median salary between the two years. The data in Table 3 strongly support the view that the salary differences between the sectors shown in Table 2 are real, and not the result of failure to control for quality differences. In other words, Ph.D.'s who work in the nonacademic sector can expect to receive on average substantially higher salaries than they would receive in the academic sector even after academic year salaries are adjusted to a full-year basis. So far we have given three different sets of estimates of the difference in salaries between the sectors for 1987. The first set is the cross-section estimates shown in Table 2. The other two sets are fixed-effect estimates for the two sets of movers between sectors shown in Table 3. In Table 4 these estimates are compared by putting them all in percentage terms on a common base: 1987 median academic salaries. The first column is computed from the fourth column of Table 2. The second column is derived by subtracting the gains in median salary of all academic stayers (the people in the first two columns of Table 3) from the gains of those who moved from the academic to the nonacademic sector, and dividing by the 1987 median academic salary. The last column is obtained by subtracting the gain in median salary of the nonacademic movers from that of the nonacademic stayers, and again dividing by 1987 median academic salaries. On the whole, the three estimates are remarkably close, with two striking anomalies. The first anomaly is the very low estimate derived from the experience of movers to the academic sector in the physical sciences. This is an unusual cell because data on mobility between the sectors by age shows that the highest mobility rate into the academic sector in the physical sciences is for those over age 50. Many of these people may have had pensions from government or industry with which to supplement their academic salaries. The second anomaly is the negative cross-section estimate of salary differences for the humanities. However, we should remember that the nonacademic humanists are not primarily in government or industry. More of them are in nonprofit institutions or in levels of education below the four-year college. If differences in salary shown in the cross-section estimates arose primarily from the fact that nonacademic Ph.D.'s were generally of higher quality than the academics, we should expect to find the fixed-effect estimates consistently below the cross-section estimates. They are not; indeed, eight of fifteen are above."}, {"section_title": "Changes through Time", "text": "Estimates of salary differentials by sector for doctoral scientists are available for the 1960s and earlier. Of those, the ones most similar to those in this paper are in Freeman (1971  National Scientific Register of the National Science Foundation; they do not include engineering, the social sciences, or the humanities. The data in the Register were obtained from questionnaires sent by professional and learned societies to their full memberships. The salary data in the Register for those paid for an academic year of nine or ten months were not adjusted upward to a full year basis. To get comparable 1987 data, the National Research Council provided me with tabulations from data from the Survey of Doctorate Recipients in which the adjustment is also not made, and which are therefore not comparable with those presented earlier in this paper. The definitions of disciplines have also been changed to match those used by Freeman (1971). Table 5 shows the resulting comparisons for 1948, 1964 and 1987. Percentage differences are shown separately for academic and government employees and for academics and employees in business or industry. The data in Table 5 show that all but one of the differentials have narrowed since 1948. From 1964 to 1987, there is no clear pattern. In some fields, notably physics and mathematics, the differentials have narrowed substantially. In others they have stayed the same or widened. Moreover, where changes have taken place, we cannot be sure why. The changes could reflect changes in the nonpecuniary advantages of academic employment or in the taste for these advantages. On the other hand, they could merely reflect changes in the proportion of academic employees paid on an academic year basis. For example, the narrowing differentials in physics might reflect an increasing proportion of academic physicists who are on research rather than teaching appointments. Percentage Differences in Unadjusted Salary by Sector, 1948Sector, , 1964Sector, and 1987 "}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "This paper began by outlining two possible explanations for salary differences between the academic and non-academic sectors: differences in the quality of people between sectors, and compensating differentials. The first of these has been effectively ruled out by the fixed effects data on movers in Table  4, where the quality of the people who move is constant. We are thus left with compensating differentials as by far the most plausible explanation of salary differences. Professional employees of academic institutions, especially faculty members, have an ability to control their own work and their own schedules that is rarely found in government or industry. In addition, tenured faculty members have a degree of job security seldom found in industry. It is entirely reasonable that those with a taste for autonomy or security would be willing to pay something for this privilege. \u2022 I am indebted to Orley Ashenfelter, William G. Bowen, Ronald G.
