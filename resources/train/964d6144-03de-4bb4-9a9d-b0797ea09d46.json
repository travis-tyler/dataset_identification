[{"section_title": "", "text": "There is a paucity of research on extension and outreach programming specific to the needs of Hispanic/ Latino specialty crop producers. However, studies with other groups of adult agricultural learners indicate trends that may also apply to this group of adult learners. Several studies have shown that active learning techniques are highly effective with adults who participate in agricultural extension programs. Strong et al. (2010) looked at the perceptions of extension educators who facilitated various teaching strategies for adult farmers and reported that hands-on learning was considered more effective than lectures and slideshow presentations. Irani et al. (2003) also evaluated adult learning through the perspective of educators and found that use of a variety of active learning strategies was associated with the motivation to learn. Surveys of university personnel and producers indicated extension educators could better align teaching styles with learning styles through hands-on demonstrations and participatory programs (Johnson et al., 2008) . Participants suggested more programming on producers' farms with extension personnel facilitating educational networking.\nEvaluations of teaching methods specific to the needs of young and women learners have revealed similar trends. Trede and Whitaker (2000) conducted surveys of beginning farmers and identified experiential learning and problem-solving activities that involve both physical and mental capacity as key to the promotion of critical thinking. Dollisso and Martin (1999) assessed learning preferences of members of a young farmer association and found practical, hands-on experiences were most preferred. A survey of women farmers found participationstyle workshops and on-farm demonstrations were preferred educational formats (Barbercheck et al., 2009) . Women with less than 5 years of experience also expressed a preference for interactive learning opportunities that included peer teaching and networking.\nAndragogy, the study of how adults learn, can provide a guiding framework for developing extension educational programming specific to adult learner needs and preferences (Irani et al., 2003; Ota et al., 2006; Strong et al., 2010) . Fundamental principles of adult learning include active participation, relevance to life and work experiences, engagement through problem solving rather than subject content, and connection to communities of practice and purpose (Knowles et al., 2005) . Ota et al. (2006) reviewed andragogy principles that have applications to extension education and proposed an increased focus on experiential techniques that connect to learner experiences. Suggestions included case study simulations, problem-solving activities, group discussion, and role play. Case studies and problem-solving"}, {"section_title": "Extension Education Methods", "text": "\u2022 April 2017 27(2) activities enable adult learners to examine real-world situations, applying their own experiences with acquired knowledge, to determine pragmatic solutions. Discussions and role play engage participants in sharing experiences to connect with subject matter, and result in critical thinking and practice adoption.\nThe goals of this project were to 1) assess extension education methods for Hispanic/Latino stakeholders who aspire to be next generation specialty crop growers and specialized horticultural managers, and 2) evaluate learning style preferences of adult Hispanic/Latino horticulturists relative to extension and outreach programming. Adult learning principles provided the theoretical framework for this project that was led by a bicultural team of Penn State Extension educators and specialists."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": "During 2014-16, team members conducted and evaluated various formats of extension programming in Spanish, including interactive workshops, model demonstration plots, on-farm trainings and tours, fact sheets and field guides, and videos. During the 2nd year of the project, we conducted surveys and interviews of Hispanic/Latino horticulturists who had participated in a variety of the educational formats offered in Spanish. All educational programs were designed to follow researchbased guidelines for building trust/ positive relationships and providing culturally responsive outreach to firstand second-generation Hispanic/ Latino communities (Farner et al., 2005; Hobbs, 2004; Olsen and Skogrand, 2009; Vega et al., 2016) .\nIN-DEPTH WORKSHOPS. A team of bilingual adult educators designed and implemented workshop lesson plans that incorporated role play, case study simulations, and various other interactive, problem-solving activities as suggested by Knowles et al. (2005) and Ota et al. (2006) . Role play was used to help learners practice scenarios relevant to their farm interests. For instance, during a session on identifying potential markets for horticultural crops, learners role-played various strategies for interviewing restaurant and store managers. Short case studies (also referred to as critical incidents) facilitated critical thinking skills relative to crop production situations or problems. For example, a case study simulation following a group discussion on protecting pollinators engaged learners in identifying possible reasons for the discovery of dead and disoriented honeybees (Apis mellifera) in front of a hive. Other participatory activities included introductory discussions to engage attendees in defining the scope of a workshop, ice-breaker games that helped gauge prior experiences relative to a topic, and round table sessions facilitated by specialty crop grower mentors.\nMODEL DEMONSTRATION PLOTS AND STUDY CIRCLES. On-farm, model vegetable demonstration plots served as ''living classrooms'' where Hispanic/ Latino learners practiced sustainable growing methods and compared production and economic performance of various cropping systems. The demonstration plots also served as sites for study circle networks that engaged a broader community of learners. The model plot and study circle curricula are described in detail at the Penn State Extension ''Start Farming'' website (Penn State Extension, 2016) under ''Courses and Workshops.'' ON-FARM TRAININGS AND TOURS. Learners who participated in this project had the opportunity to visit with other Hispanic/Latino farmers during on-farm tours and trainings. The tours provided a variety of experiential learning formats including hands-on demonstrations on fruit tree pruning and field walks to learn crop scouting skills.\nOur team developed fact sheets, field scouting guides, and videos to supplement the hands-on, problemsolving learning modules. These were produced in both Spanish and English, and in both hard copy and electronic formats. The videos were used during in-depth workshops and also serve as two initial modules in online horticulture trainings for Hispanic learners.\nTwo educators on our team had formal training in adult learning, and they engaged the learners in postprogram evaluations to assess presentation techniques used during the face-to-face field and classroom trainings. All program participants contributed to the follow-up evaluations by completing a standardized questionnaire designed to provide feedback relative to four key adult learning principles: 1) opportunities for active participation, 2) depth of engagement, 3) relevance to life and work, and 4) development of problemsolving skills. During 30-min open discussions at the conclusion of each program, participants informally shared details on relevance of the specific program topics to their professional goals.\nPurposive surveys and interviews were conducted to assess 1) methods of learning preferred by Hispanic/ Latino growers, 2) ways extension might increase and improve education and engagement with Hispanic/ Latino growers, and 3) factors that might limit Hispanic/Latino specialty crop growers from participating in extension educational activities and/or using extension resources. Written surveys that began with a consistent set of five multiple choice questions (followed by program-specific questions) were conducted following three workshops for Hispanic/Latino specialty crop growers. Sixty-one participants (out of a total of 70) voluntarily completed the surveys after being advised of the purpose of the study. Nine Hispanic/Latino learners who had attended a variety of extension offerings in Spanish were individually interviewed. The same five questions were asked, and participants were encouraged to provide reasons for the answers selected."}, {"section_title": "Results and discussion", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Y E A R 1 : P O S T P R O G R A M DISCUSSIONS/EVALUATIONS TO ASSESS", "text": "EDUCATION METHODS. Feedback on presentation techniques used during workshops, field demonstrations, study circles, and tours in the first year of the project indicated trends similar to those described for other adult agricultural learners. The most successful formats provided opportunities for active learning of researchbased information that was applicable to participant operations. This feedback helped us to develop the following general facilitation outline for future sessions for Hispanic/Latino learners: 1) begin with a social activity or icebreaker to engage participants in sharing problem-solving goals for the session and to determine how to make topics most relevant to their work and life experiences, 2) conduct a short, interactive exercise to gauge current knowledge and practices, 3) explore multiple ways of transforming lecture-style teaching practices into problem-based learning, using collaborative and activity-based approaches, 4) where possible, involve experienced growers as mentors, 5) include an opportunity for networking with the other grower learners (e.g., a meal is an essential part of study circles), and 6) conclude with a time for reflection during which participants share what they learned relative to their goals and experiences."}, {"section_title": "Y E A R 2 : S U R V E Y S A N D INTERVIEWS TO ASSESS LEARNING PREFERENCES RELATIVE TO OUTREACH", "text": "AND EXTENSION PROGRAMMING. Purposive surveys and interviews conducted during Year 2 of the project identified further ways to adapt extension outreach and education for bilingual learners. DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS OF SURVEY PARTICIPANTS. Participants who completed questionnaires represented a range of years of experience in specialty crop production and years of experience with extension programs in Spanish (Table 1) . Twentyseven percent had been involved in horticultural production for less than 5 years, 39% for 5 to 10 years, and 34% for over 10 years. Individual growers had multiple areas of specialty crop production experience, with the highest responses being tree fruit followed by vegetable production. Experience with extension programs in Spanish ranged from 36% for 1 to 2 years, to 38% for 3 to 4 years, and 26% for over 4 years."}, {"section_title": "R A T I N G S O F M E T H O D S O F LEARNING BASED ON EXPERIENCES", "text": "AND PREFERENCES. Survey participants rated seven methods of learning on a 1 to 5 scale, with 1 being ''poor'' and 5 being ''highly effective.'' Participants responded that they liked a variety of educational methods, with their top choices being on-farm demonstrations and study circles, tours of other growers' farms, self-paced online courses and videos, and interactive workshops (Fig. 1) . Interviewed Hispanic/Latino growers provided additional insights into learning preferences, stating that during on-farm trainings and interactive workshops they have the opportunities to ''see things the way they are, not just theory,'' ''share experiences,'' and ''compare field results and generate new ideas.'' They liked ''handson'' formats more than ''principles or lectures.'' They also indicated why they liked a mix of educational formats. In the words of one grower, ''during on-farm presentations you are able to ask; in the fact sheets and production guides there are things that a speaker doesn't have time to address; and during in-depth workshops there's a lot more information.'' Many of the preferences were similar to those cited in previous studies on educational perceptions for young (Trede and Whitaker, 2000) and women (Barbercheck et al., 2009) Dollisso and Martin (1999) indicated they preferred to learn by a variety of methods compared with either self-study or group instruction."}, {"section_title": "RATINGS OF WAYS EXTENSION AND OTHER AG PROFESSIONALS MIGHT INCREASE/IMPROVE EDUCATION AND E N G A G E M E N T W I T H HISPANIC/ LATINO GROWERS.", "text": "Survey participants rated nine stakeholder engagement options on a 1 to 5 scale, with 1 being ''poor'' and 5 being ''highly effective.''

The three options in this cluster were followed closely by creating opportunities for Latino growers to network with extension personnel and ag service providers, inviting Latino growers to participate in educational programs as round-table participants and/or mentors, and providing more opportunities for classroom education in Spanish in cooperation with local community colleges or literacy programs. Growers who were interviewed offered additional suggestions, including ''offering credits or help with certifications,'' ''improving communication on topics of interest to workshop participants,'' and ''motivating growers to attend programs by helping them to see possible career benefits.'' Similar to studies conducted in rural Washington (Mullinix et al., 2006) , Hispanic/Latino fruit and vegetable growers valued opportunities for career advancement and were most likely to seek out community-based programs. Hispanic/Latino growers indicated that timing of the program (e.g., avoiding busy seasons such as planting or harvest) was the greatest limitation [46% of total responses (Fig. 3) ].\nOther major deterrents included cost, location, and length of program. Session or resource not in Spanish received slightly fewer responses, a total of 25%. By comparison, negative past experiences, not being aware of sessions, and topics not relevant received 10% to 15% of total responses. Many of the growers who were interviewed replied that nothing would limit them from participating in extension programs or using extension resources. One grower explained more about the importance of program timing, suggesting that it was important to avoid scheduling programs during the busiest times of the growing season. Another grower explained that it is easier to learn technical information in Spanish but growers also like to attend programs in English so they can improve their language proficiency. These findings were similar to those reported by Hobbs (2004) in an article on extension outreach programs for first-and second-generation Hispanic/Latino audiences. Irregular work schedules indicated program timing was highly important, and Latino adults, even those fluent in English, appreciated the respect shown for their culture with Spanish or bilingual communication."}, {"section_title": "Project limitations", "text": "Building trusting extension relationships with minority stakeholders takes time and commitment. As a result the survey sample size was suboptimal for making fixed conclusions on learning style and educational method preferences.

The surveys conducted after Fig. 3 . Factors that have limited, or would limit, survey participants (n = 61) from participating in extension educational activities and/or using extension resources for Hispanic/Latino specialty crop growers. Growers who completed a postprogram, written questionnaire following three interactive workshops conducted in Spanish had the opportunity to select multiple limitations regarding extension program participation.\ninteractive workshops included questions designed to measure knowledge gained and practices changed, and although not a central objective of the project reported here, 66% reported an increase in knowledge in at least two subject areas, 62% planned to improve a horticultural skill, and 50% planned to adopt a new practice to protect the environment. As reported in other studies on outreach to Hispanic/ Latino audiences (Olsen et al., 2009; Vega et al., 2016) , consistent presence and programming will be important to the long-term, measureable success of this initiative."}, {"section_title": "Implications for university extension and outreach", "text": "In regions of the country where Hispanic/Latino growers have been involved in specialty crop production for more than two generations, many are now farm owners and industry leaders, as indicated in the most recent Census of Agriculture (USDA, 2014). University extension educators and specialists have an opportunity to provide significant support for this promising next generation of specialty crop producers through relevant, interactive outreach and educational programming. Based on the preliminary needs assessments described in this paper, future extension efforts will include 1) learner engagement by use of social media in Spanish, 2) holding some educational programs specifically for Hispanic/ Latino producers, 3) holding educational programs at the farms of Hispanic/Latino growers, and 4) a variety of bilingual, educational formats including on-farm demonstrations and study circles, tours of other growers' farms, self-paced online courses and videos, and hands-on workshops. As with any community of growers or learners, Hispanic/Latino stakeholders are diverse, and needs assessments will be ongoing.\nLiterature cited"}]
