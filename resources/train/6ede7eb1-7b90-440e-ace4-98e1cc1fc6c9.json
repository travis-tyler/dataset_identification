Background and Motivation", "text": "U.S. agricultural policies have come under considerable scrutiny with regard to their ability to encourage and support small-scale producers while maintaining a commitment to the large commercial farms that produce the lion's share of the country's food and fiber (CFRA, 2008;HSPH, 2012). Although some observers have argued that policy favors the latter group and does little or nothing to help the former, current trends suggest the contrary. \"Over recent years the U.S. agricultural industry has seen a resurgence of small-scale farming and for the first time since the great depression, between 2002 and 2007, the U.S. farm count rose 4%, reversing the long-standing decline\" (USDA, 2009 as quoted in the Washington Post). During the same period, the U.S. Census of Agriculture, which is conducted every five years by the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), recorded a loss of 16,183,216 acres or 1.7% of the 938,279,056 total acres of U.S. farmland (USDA, 2009). In addition, decreases in the average farm-size suggest a shift toward small-scale farming; however, both the largest and the smallest farm-size classes are increasing as a proportion of total farms, and a continual loss in the proportion of farms in the 100-to-2000-acre range has been observed. It is the decline in these middle-sized farms that is responsible for the significant and continual reduction in total U.S. farmland. The current trends in U.S. agriculture are also seen within the state of Connecticut. Average farm-size in the state is 83 acres, and a third of all farms have less than 50 acres; thus, Connecticut is dominated by small-scale farming (USDA, 2009;WLA, 2010). The 17% increase in CT farm numbers during the 2002-2007 period well exceeded the national average (4%), and is mainly attributed to new small-scale farms (USDA, 2009). Increased public interest in Connecticut farming has been observed over the same period, with as much as a 237% bump in agro-tourism, based on data collected in a recent survey of 101 farms (WLA, 2010). As of 2007, the CT dairy industry had an average farm-size of about 600 acres, suggesting that many CT dairy farms are classified as middle-sized (USDA, 2009;NMAMA, 2007). During the same period, the dairy sector in the state decreased by 53 farms, from 193 in 2002 to 140 in 2007. This decline has continued reaching 124 farms in 2011 (NMAMA, 2002;NMAMA, 2007;NMAMA, 2011). Since 2002, Connecticut has seen a loss of about 4,500 acres of dairy land per year, which represents 5.4% of the 83,000 acres held by the dairy industry in 2007 (USDA, 2009). Thus, the loss in dairy acreage is a major contributor to the estimated loss of farmland (cropland and farm woodland) in Connecticut during the period 1997(USDA, 2009. Loss of farmland is a major threat to the agricultural sector. Once land is moved from agricultural production into an alternative use, it is not easily converted back (WLA, 2010). Because the supply of farmland is particularly limited, losses are unlikely to be offset by an increase in supply elsewhere; food security from local production is irreplaceable in much the same way (Lacy, 2006). Overall market conditions and pressure toward residential and commercial development are significant drivers of the continual loss of farmland (Platt, 1980;Lopez et al., 1988). In response to these forces, farmland protection agencies have worked to secure land for future generations of farmers through the purchase of development rights and other conservation programs (WLA, 2010). The ability to secure land through these programs can only go so far; thus, additional government policies must also play a role in the preservation of farms. As described in Connecticut General Statute 22-26aa, \"the conservation of certain arable agricultural land and adjacent pastures, woods, natural drainage areas and open space areas is vital for the well being of the people of Connecticut\". 2 In Connecticut, the dairy industry was responsible for the stewardship of 83,000 acres of farmland in 2007 (USDA, 2009). That same year, the industry contributed an estimated $1 billion in statewide sales and generated 4,000 jobs (DECD, 2008;Lopez et al., 2010). Prior to the large drop in dairy farms during the early twenty-first century, a period of stability occurred from 1999 One conservation strategy is to design policies that target agricultural enterprises with significant land requirements and/or holdings. Providing for such enterprises ensures the availability of land for future generations of farmers, as well as support for the current population by securing farm-related jobs. More general policies, such as CT Public Act 490, target the entire agricultural sector by allowing for a differential tax assessment for farmland at a lower agricultural use value. A justification for Public Act 490 is that the costs to municipalities associated with servicing agricultural land are low and, even with the reduction in tax revenues, municipalities enjoy a net public benefit from farmland. In contrast, the residential sector faces greater municipal service costs, which tend to be sufficiently higher than the associated tax revenues (CFBA, 2010). to 2001, when the Northeast Dairy Compact was in effect, setting prices to ensure adequate returns to dairy farmers in the region (DECD, 2008). At other times, the price received by dairy farmers has been based on the market conditions for milk, which vary considerably, as can be seen in Figure 1. The price received by farmers is measured as the statistical uniform price (SUP), which is the minimum price paid to dairy farmers based on the market order utilization of Class I, II, III, and IV milk. Soon after the Northeast Dairy Compact expired, the SUP began to decrease, and in 2003 it dropped below $12.00/cwt in nominal terms ( Figure 1). In real terms, i.e., adjusted for inflation, the SUP has decreased sharply since 1980 and has been highly volatile over the past decade. The SUP peaked at almost $23/cwt in 2007, though as a result of the worldwide economic recession it dropped back down to 2003 levels in 2009. This sharp drop was compounded by major increases in feed prices. It has been noted that the worldwide economic recession has had a major negative effect on dairy farm profitability, a situation that is expected to remain critical over the foreseeable future (Thraen, 2008). Given the challenges faced by dairy farmers in the state, the Food Marketing Policy Center at the University of Connecticut produced several reports from 2002 to 2008 on milk prices at the farm, wholesale, and retail levels. The center also hosted meetings with stakeholders and provided expert testimony at the state and federal levels. 3 Connecticut Public Act 09-229 directs the Commissioner of Agriculture to provide payments to farmers when the federal milk pay price drops below a sustainable monthly cost of production (COP). As defined in the act, the \"Federal pay price\" is the northeast monthly SUP for milk in Hartford, CT, pursuant to the United States Department of Agriculture Northeast Federal Milk Marketing Order. The \"minimum sustainable monthly cost of production\" (MSC) is defined as 82% of the baseline cost of production for a New England state as determined by the Much of the research focused on means to assist dairy farmers with the creation of state policies in CT and other New England states (Cotterill, et. al., 2007;Cotterill and Rabinowitz, 2007). Subsequently, the Connecticut state legislature passed Public Act 09-229 on July 1, 2009, to try to mitigate further declines in the dairy sector. on the data and variables published by the USDA (P.A. 09-229 and 11-48). Current estimates for the monthly average COP for a New England state are developed from the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) for Vermont and Maine but not for the other New England states. However, concern has been expressed repeatedly over the differences between the Connecticut dairy industry and those of other New England states, and the accuracy of using a non-Connecticut COP estimate to apply the Connecticut law (Rabinowitz and Lopez, 2011 (OR #2)). In response to the concerns over the application of the law and the need to develop a CTspecific milk COP, the Zwick Center at the University of Connecticut hosted a Dairy Summit in November 2011. At this summit, stakeholders 4 discussed moving forward with the development of CT-specific COP estimates and reached a consensus that the most appropriate method requires data from CT dairy farmers. In order to obtain these figures, the Commissioner asked the Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics (DARE), the Zwick Center, and the"}, {"section_title": "Connecticut Cooperative Extension System within the College of Agriculture and Natural", "text": "Resources (CANR) at the University of Connecticut to undertake a study to determine the COP for milk in the state."}, {"section_title": "II.

Methodology and Data", "text": "Data collection was initiated following a letter from the Commissioner of Agriculture to state dairy producers describing the nature and importance of the project. Other divergences between the standard CCRH recommendations and the practices followed in the Cornell methodology stem from whole-farm considerations; in particular, the mechanism by which the data are adjusted to account for only the dairy portion of the farm operation. A dairy farm typically produces and sells goods other than milk, such as crops and livestock, and is therefore a multi-enterprise operation. Expenses that are incurred at the wholefarm level (e.g., utilities, management), which are referred to as general farm overhead expenses, need to be allocated to specific enterprises based on some predetermined method. In the case of dairy farming and the calculation of the COP for milk, one needs to allocate the overhead expenses between milk and all other enterprises. The CCRH recommendation is for the allocation of overhead expenses to be done during data collection based on information provided directly by the farmer, which is the practice followed by the USDA ARMS survey. However, the Cornell DFBS uses a different allocation method where all non-milk expenses are deducted from whole-farm expenses, resulting in the milk-related expenses from which the COP is calculated. Moreover, the DFBS methodology relies on the assumption that a farm's non-milk expenses are equal to its non-milk receipts. Thus, the milk-related portion of expenses is calculated by deducting non-milk receipts from total expenses (DFBS, 2011). The next step is to add machinery and building depreciation to the milk-only operating cost category to determine the purchased inputs cost of producing milk. Box 3 includes the full description of the Cornell DFBS method by which costs are determined. Costs associated with certain dairy related inputs are determined indirectly, and such costs must be assessed using the best available value (described in Appendix A). Examples of such inputs are unpaid family and operator labor, the value of the operator's management, and the value of land, as well as other capital assets (CCRH, 1998). A list of standard alternatives for costing out each input is provided in Box 3. The DFBS program allocates an interest charge (r) of 5% on equity capital to reflect the opportunity cost of land and other capital assets. This has been a long standing practice, which Cornell has found to yield a consistent estimate of the amount that could be earned in other businesses with similar risk in an economy with little or no inflation (Knoblauch, 2012). Unpaid family and operator labor is charged at $2,994.60 per month, which is based on 230 hours per month of full-time equivalent work at a mean hourly wage rate of $13.02 for agricultural farmworkers and laborers. This wage rate is reported by the BLS for Connecticut for May 2011 (http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_ct.htm). The opportunity cost of operator labor and management used is the amount reported by farmers which is intended to represent the value of off-farm employment based on the operator's education, age and experience (Appendix A). All of these costs are then added to the costs of purchased inputs to determine the total cost of producing milk (Box 3). Once data collection and verification was complete, the mean farm-size of the sample of 43 farms was compared to that of the entire state industry to determine the representativeness of the sample. Table 1  averages overestimate the population mean, and an adjustment is required. One method for adjusting the sample to better represent the population is by statistical weighting. If the actual distribution of output for state producers is available, the sample may be weighted to accurately reflect the distribution of state output. Although additional data for state production were provided by the Department of Agriculture, these data was not used for this purpose because it was incomplete, primarily due to missing production information for periods when Public Act 09-229 payments were not provided to dairy farms. Another method is to drop farms at either end of the distribution until the means coincide in value. This is the method used herein to adjust the sample of farms to better represent the state dairy industry, and to produce a representative estimate of the average COP for CT milk in 2011. Following this process we drop the four largest farms (approximately 10% of the whole sample) leaving 39 farms (Table 1). By comparison, the average herd size for the 39 farms remaining in the sample is 150 cows, slightly less than the state average of 153 cows. The average output per farm for the sample is 29,093 cwt, slightly more than the state average of 28,166. Furthermore, output per cow in the sample is 187 cwt, compared to 184 cwt for the state. Overall, the number of farms, total cows and total output for the sample represents just under one-third of the dairy farms in CT, and the averages for key variables are now very similar. Participation in comparable dairy COP studies for other states in the region include a lesser proportion of total state farms in their study sample. For instance, a 2010 Maine dairy COP study also had a total of 39 farms participating; however, this represents only 14% of the total Maine dairies (Kersbergen et al., 2011 Thus a one-month lag following the end of the quarter is recommended for generating monthly estimates, e.g., data for quarter 3 (July-September) should be provided at the end of October. Corrections to the monthly estimates as a result of updated NASS indices are provided in subsequent reports, and adjustments by the Commissioner of Agriculture can be considered if necessary."}, {"section_title": "IV. Results and Discussion", "text": "This section first presents the results for Connecticut along with a brief discussion of some The results of the 2011 COP for CT are provided in Table 3. The average COP for the sample of 39 farms is $31.52/cwt. This sample is further broken down into three farm classes based on herd size, and a fourth size class which includes the four farms dropped from the largest size class. The size classes are generated for farms with 25-99, 100-249, 250-500, and 250+ (III*) cows. The COP per hundredweight for each size class is $37.10, $26.84, $28.39, and $25.91, respectively. Feed and labor expenses are the greatest contributors to the COP and combined they make up more than 50% of the total COP, as seen in Figure 2. Total feed costs are estimated at 29% of the COP at $9.65/cwt, and labor costs, accounting for 30% of the COP, are estimated at $9.94/cwt for the representative sample. Economies of scale are seen in the overall decrease in average COP from the smallest to the largest farm-size class. Total operating costs are observed to be more consistent across farmsize than total allocated overhead, which is a more significant driver of the scale economies (Figure 3). The pattern of decreasing costs with farm-size is observed for most input categories. It is worth noting that the higher opportunity cost of labor and management per cwt for smaller compared to larger farms is an important contributor to economies of scale (Figure 3). The 2011 COP for Vermont and Maine from the NASS adjusted USDA ARMS Survey is $32.61/cwt and $37.45/cwt, respectively (Table 5). Of the three New England states, Connecticut, with 124 total farms and 19,000 cows, has the smallest dairy industry, the lowest cost of production ($31.52/cwt), and the largest average herd size (153 cows) (  (Table 7), and the Cornell DFBS method ( Table 8). The New York dairy industry has a much smaller average herd size than CT, yet average COP is considerably less ( Farm Credit method is designed to measure the cash operating expenses for the farm and it does not include several allocated overhead expenses (e.g., the opportunity cost of labor and capital). Therefore, the Farm Credit COP estimates are lower than the other methods. In addition, the UConn Modified DFBS are closer to the USDA results because of the one-time nature of the estimation, where farms have not used prior analysis to benchmark their performance. The 2011 FCE (Net) COP for New England dairy farms is $19.72/cwt, with adjusted cash operating expenses of $20.71/cwt (Table 7). Deducting the value for hired labor from the FCE adjusted cash operating expenses results in a value of $17.65/cwt, which is close to the estimated operating expenses for CT at $17.16/cwt (Table 3). Again, because of the larger average farm-size in CT than in the other New England states, and keeping in mind the relevance of economies of scale, costs in CT would be lower than for the average New England dairy farm. The results for the 2012 monthly CT COP based on the NASS indices indicate a steady increase in the operating costs for milk production, with an increase observed in every month except February. The range in operating costs from January to September is $17.04/cwt to $23.16/cwt (Table 4). Allocated overhead costs are also increasing from month-to-month, with a range of $14.93/cwt to $15.94/cwt. The total cost of production follows suit with a range of $31.97/cwt to $39.10/cwt from January to September. Feed costs are observed to be a major driver of the increased COP and have risen steadily through the year, from $8.24/cwt in January to $13.61/cwt in September, which accounts for the majority of the increase in total operating costs. Similarly, the opportunity cost of unpaid labor and management is the most significant contributor to the increase in allocated overhead, ranging from $6.89/cwt in January to $7.31/cwt in September. Likewise, NASS adjustments to the VT and ME COP reveal the same general trends, because the NASS indices used are provided as a national value and are identical across states. Again, these trends are shown for CT in Table 4 and for VT and ME in Tables 9 and 10. As discussed, the COP for CT, VT, and ME has steadily increased through 2012, which also holds for the MSC. The SUP exhibits a net increase from January to September, after slightly decreasing month-to-month for the first half of the year followed by sharp increases in each month of the third quarter (Table 11). The net result of the behavior of the COP and the SUP is an increase in the value of payments to CT dairy farms. The payment to CT dairy farmers ranges from $6.95/cwt in January to $12.71/cwt in September."}, {"section_title": "V. Summary and Concluding Remarks", "text": "The objective of this study was to estimate the average COP for CT milk in 2011, which resulted in an estimated value of $31.52/cwt (Table 3). Although data from only 39 of the 43 participating farms are included in the analysis of CT COP, the information from the four largest farms is not completely lost as they are used in the analysis for a class including the biggest operations. The average COP for milk is observed to increase with farm-size signaling the importance of economies of scale in dairy production, a relationship that is well established in the literature. Moving forward, the 2011 annual COP can be the basis for estimating monthly costs accurately for a limited period of time. The previously used USDA ARMS data are from a survey that is conducted for dairy farms every five years. One of the criticisms of using the ARMS data, besides the fact that CT data are not collected by the USDA, is that the error in COP estimation becomes larger as the period from the most recent survey increases. This is partly because the adjustments rest solely on national indices which fail to account for regional or state specific variation over time. For this reason, a shorter interval between surveys is recommended for CT. Additionally, consideration should be given for the potential for state-specific cost shocks that deviate from the national averages reflected in the NASS indices when computing current monthly COP estimates. To achieve this, alternative price indices should be reviewed as a means for checking the validity of monthly COP estimates. Given the recent trends and the relative importance of purchased feed in the total COP for milk, it is recommended that monthly wholesale data on feed prices be collected from major wholesalers in CT and incorporated into the monthly COP estimates. Even if the basis for projecting monthly costs is addressed, a decision needs to be made on how best to proceed with future annual COP baseline estimates. Using the Cornell DFBS offers the opportunity for farmers to participate annually in a data-entry process that provides an additional benefit to individual farms, i.e. the ability to track the year-to-year progress of the farm and to benchmark against similar participating producers in CT and other states. Farmers who are proactive in this sense will work to become more profitable by allocating their costs more efficiently. This annual data-entry process, however, is duplicative for farmers that are already participating in the Farm Credit East system and thus may be viewed as unnecessary. Ultimately, policy makers need to address several questions, including the following: \uf0d8 How often should the data for CT be collected, and in how much detail? Regardless of the frequency in yearly COP estimation, the most recent estimates available will be used to determine payment to CT dairies when the MSC falls below the SUP. The purpose of this study, and the estimation of the CT COP for milk, was to ensure that policy makers are provided the best information available in order to base policy decisions and to apply Public Act 09-229. Given the results for the 2011 CT COP, prospective payments have increased in every month during 2012 to the point where the calculated payments to dairy farms exceeds the available funds for the program. The long-term success or failure of the program to mitigate further declines in farm numbers and thus maintain the current size of the CT dairy industry remains an open question, and while beyond the scope of this research, is worthwhile for future consideration. In comparison to the CT program, Maine uses a \"Tier Program\" to establish price supports at increasing levels of production, or tiers, which is consistent with the notion that smaller farms have higher per cwt costs of production. Payments are based on the differential between the base price and the target price specific to the tier or cumulative production (in terms of pounds of milk) of the farm (Kersbergen et al., 2011). Evidence suggests that Maine's Tier Program might have helped in keeping farms in production, given that the relative loss in farms has been lower than in the neighboring states of New Hampshire and Vermont during the period 2004-2010 (Drake, 2011, as referenced in Kersbergen et al., 2011). In CT, dairy farmers have welcomed state support during the recent downturn in milk prices and profitability. Direct interaction with participating farmers has been constructive as they have expressed many of their concerns, hopes, and appreciation for the ongoing policy efforts. At the same time, the lack of participation of many farms in the state has been a source of concern.    ------------------------------ Source : Based on CT DFBS Survey, 2012, and updated using current per cow and production input indexes. <http://www.ers.usda.gov/Data/CostsAndReturns/monthlymilkcosts.htm>    ----------------------------- -----------------------------  Changes in inventory o represents feeds and supplies purchased this year but not used (positive change), and similar items purchased in a prior year and used this year (negative change).

Custom operations could include all, none, or several of the tasks performed in the production of the product.

In these situations, it is more economical for small farm operators to rely on custom operations instead of owning the equipment and performing the activities themselves. At the same time, some small operators may have access to low cost equipment that would not be suitable for a larger operator.
