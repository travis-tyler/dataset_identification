In particular, labor's share of GDP in a state is found as the ratio of unambiguous labor income (UL) to the sum of UL and unambiguous capital income (UK) (both restricted to the private sector). UL is compensation of employees and UK accounts for corporate profits, rental income, net interest income, and depreciation in the state.

There were missing observations for some states and years for two reasons. In 18 out of the 45 years of our sample, the NSF collected no data. 10 In other cases, the data are not reported if one firm did most of the R&D in the state that year. We log-linearly impute missing values, but only if they are missing for no more than three consecutive years. Table A .11 presents the average of R&D expenditure as percentage of GDP for our sample.\nTo construct the R&D capital stock variable, we follow the perpetual inventory method used throughout the literature. Specifically, we estimate initial R&D capital stock with the formula I 0 /(g + \u03b4), where I 0 is the average investment of the first 3 years available, g is the average geometric growth rate of the level of investment in each series, and \u03b4 is the depreciation rate. 12 Following Coe and Helpman (1995) and Bronzini and Piselli (2009) , we use a 5% depreciation rate for R&D. 13 The final R&D capital stock variable is available for 83.1% of the possible 2,295 state-years in the sample. States with many missing values are typically those with the smallest population.\n14 In our analysis we also consider the spillover effect of R&D across states. To estimate the spillover effect, we create three measures of R&D performed in other states. All take the general form of a weighted average: _ = \u2211 \u2260 ; the difference is in the definition of the weights w ij , although in all cases the weights sum to unity for each i. To introduce the notion of distance in economic geography, in our second definition of the average other-state R&D stock, _ , we weight R&D in other states based on economic similarity and relevance of R&D across sectors (i.e., technological similarity). To construct this indicator, we calculated pairwise economic similarity weights for every pair of states i and j in our study. This is done on a year-by-year basis, although time subscripts are suppressed in the notation. The approach we take to create the economic similarity weight is the following. Let be the share of state j's economy in industry (group) k, measured as a fraction of SGDP. The industry groups are defined by SIC for earlier years and NAICS for later years, and are at the two-and three-digit level. 15 Then an initial similarity measure between states i and j is:\nis between zero and one, with the extremes meaning no overlap and full overlap (i.e., exactly matching proportions of industries in the composition of the two states' economies).\nWe next refine to control for the amount of R&D that each industry does. For example, the industrial sectors of two states may match closely but in low-R&D performing industries such as the service sector. The R&D stocks in each state will be of less relevance to the other state than if the closely matching economies were heavily skewed toward R&D-important industries such as high-tech manufacturing. Define weight to be the national-level industry weight based on how much of national total private R&D is performed in an industry k. Then the final similarity measure is:\nWhile in theory ranges from zero to one, in our data the range is . From the similarity measure, weights are created proportional to but normalized to unity for each state i.\nFor the third definition of R&D performed in other states, _ , at the suggestion of a referee we explored an alternative notion of geographic distance: contiguity. In this case the weights come from a contiguity matrix in which w ij is 1 for contiguous states i and j, and zero otherwise. Again, the weights are normalized to sum to unity for each state."}, {"section_title": "Appendix 2: Methodology", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Model", "text": "For the derivation of the empirical model we use to estimate the impact of R&D on output and productivity, we follow much of the empirical growth literature (e.g., Coe and Helpman, 1995; Bronzini and Piselli, 2009) and assume a production function with Hicks-neutral TFP:\nwhere i is a state index, and t is a year index. Y represents private sector output, L is private sector labor, K is the private sector physical capital stock; and TFP is Total Factor Productivity.\nWe do not include in the production function the stock of public infrastructure, as Bronzini and Piselli (2009) do. In the case of the United States, we expect public infrastructure to be relatively homogenous across states, and we are unlikely to observe significant variation. Thus, we do not find necessary to include this variable in our estimation of the model. TFP is driven by technological change, which in turn is driven by R&D investment, human capital accumulation, and other factors. Therefore we have that\nwhere is the \"unexplained\" technical change, is the human capital stock, and is the stock of R&D capital, all for state i in year t. We follow Bronzini and Piselli (2009) and include the spillover effect of R&D across states through RD_OTHER, the distance-weighted R&D stock from other states. We parameterize unexplained technological change as the product of stateand year-specific fixed effects: = exp ( + ) . Substituting this expression for into Equation (A2.2), substituting the result into Equation (A2.1), and finally taking logs, we get:\nwhere the lower-case letters stand for natural logarithm, and and are error terms. To account for the year effects , we time-demean all variables (without explicitly changing our notation) from here on except where noted.\nWe adopt alternate assumptions about \u03b1 and \u03b2 for purposes of comparison. In our first econometric approach, in which log SGDP is the dependent variable (Equation (A2.3)), we make no assumptions about returns to scale and place no restrictions on \u03b1 and \u03b2. The second approach is based on Equation (A2.4). TFP is calculated for the dependent variable as\nwhere \u03b1 and \u03b2 are calculated directly from input shares in the SGDP accounts. This second method thus imposes constant returns to private inputs labor and capital, so that \u03b2 = 1-\u03b1."}, {"section_title": "Econometric Strategy", "text": "We estimate the models in Equations (A2.3) and (A2.4) using our unbalanced panel with all available data between 1963 and 2007. The equations are in log levels instead of log changes in order to assess the long-run relationships in the data. The levels of output, TFP, and the R&D stock also have the advantage of being much less sensitive to measurement error than their growth rates, which can bias estimation (Griliches and Hausman, 1986 \nwhere x it is a vector of the regressors from Equation (A2.3) (or Equation (A2.4), depending on which specification is being estimated), \u03b1 i is a fixed effect, and \u03b5 it is white noise. The specification allows state-specific coefficients on the lagged dependent variable and regressors, allowing for dynamics that differ across units of the panel.\nBefore estimating the unrestricted form of Equation (A2.5), we first restrict p = q = 0 and furthermore assume y and x are each I(1) and are cointegrated. Then \u03b8 = \u03b4 i0 is the coefficient vector describing the long run (cointegrating) relationship between y and x. Kao and Chiang (2001) show that (under certain conditions) a consistent estimate of \u03b8, \ufffd , can be obtained from the following panel Dynamic OLS (DOLS) regression\nwhere the lag/lead length \u2192 \u221e as \u2192 \u221e. The DOLS model is restrictive because it requires all variables be I(1), y and x to be cointegrated, and the variance structure and short run dynamics to be identical across states. Thus we use the DOLS model only for our initial estimations. Now return to the unrestricted Equation (A2.5). Allow vector x to be I(0) or I(1), and assume that the order of integration of y is no more than the order of x. However, we still assume the long run relationship between y and x (captured by ) is common across states.\nThen, we can re-write Equation (A2.5) in error correction form:\nwhere \u03b8 and the starred coefficients are functions of the original parameters in Equation (A2.5).

To test these assumptions, in Table A .2 we shows the results of two different unit roots tests for the variables included in our baseline model. There are many tests for panel unit roots available; we choose two that are appropriate for large N, large T asymptotics and allow unbalanced panels. The unit root test of Im et al. (2003) has the null hypothesis that all panels are integrated and the alternative hypothesis that at least one panel is stationary. 20 The results for the variables before removing the time-means are in the first column of Table A .2, and they\nshow that the human capital variable may not have unit roots in each state. The conclusions are the same from the ADF-Fisher tests (Choi, 2001) . 21 We next test the time-demeaned variables;\nresults are in the middle pair of columns of Table A .2. We fail to reject the null hypothesis of nonstationarity for any variable except TFP at the 5% level, although the null is still rejected for human capital at the 10% level. The ADF-Fisher tests fail to reject the null hypothesis for any variable. There is thus mixed evidence for the nonstationarity of TFP. If TFP is I(0), the DOLS estimator will fail but the PMG estimator is still consistent.\nTo make sure none of the variables is integrated at higher orders, we repeat the tests on the differenced form of the variables (results are in the last two columns of Table A .2). The hypothesis of nonstationarity of all panels is convincingly rejected in each case. Thus, each series appears to be I(1) in each state, except possibly TFP. In summary, the data appear to satisfy the assumptions of the DOLS and PMG estimators when SGDP is used as the dependent variable but satisfy only the assumptions of the PMG estimator with TFP as the dependent variable.\nWe also explore whether there is evidence of cointegration, as supposed by our estimation strategy. To test for cointegration we use a battery of residual-based tests for panel data from Pedroni (1999) and Kao (1999) . We perform the cointegration test for the SGDP and TFP models using the baseline regression specification introduced in the next section. The results are shown in Table A .3. The null hypothesis of no cointegration is rejected in the majority of cases overall, although the case is weaker for the TFP regression. The parametric panel tstatistic, which \u00d6rsal (2007) found to have the best size and power among the Pedroni statistics, rejects the null for all cases except the TFP regression with time-demeaned variables. 22 Given that failure to reject the null may merely indicate low power of a test, we interpret the mixed results as providing reasonable evidence for the existence of long-run relationships among the data, except perhaps for TFP with time-demeaned variables. et al. (1999) assess the econometric validity of using OLS for cointegrated data, and propose the use of dynamic OLS (DOLS) instead to avoid bias. We thus begin (but do not conclude) our empirical exploration with DOLS. Table A .4 presents the DOLS estimates for the baseline estimations. 23 The first two estimations, for SGDP and TFP, respectively, use the raw data without removing the time means. The third DOLS estimation in Table A .4 is for SGDP and uses the time-demeaned data. Regardless of which DOLS estimation is considered, we find that there is evidence of a positive effect of R&D on SGDP in the long run from R&D performed in the state. The long-run own-elasticity for R&D varies from 0.013 to 0.061 among the estimations. These elasticities fall within the range of results for R&D own-elasticity estimates from country-level panel data studies cited in Hall et al. (2010) ."}, {"section_title": "Baseline DOLS Estimation Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Kao", "text": "The results for the impact from other-state R&D are mixed when using the DOLS estimator. In the first estimation, the other-elasticity is 0.050 and highly significant. The second estimate is about the same magnitude but insignificant. Recall that the dependent variable in this regression, TFP, may not be integrated within each state, which would lead to inconsistency in the DOLS estimates. The third estimate, from the time-demeaned data, is negative, a puzzling result. There are some other unexpected results that may indicate that the assumptions of the DOLS model are not satisfied. While capital and labor contribute positively and significantly to SGDP, the coefficient on capital is larger than (in column 1) or equal to (in column 3) the coefficient on labor. 24 Furthermore, human capital is not statistically significant in the first estimation, which is unexpected given the great importance this variable has been found to have in other growth and TFP regressions (Mankiw et al., 1992; Coe et al,, 2009; Bronzini and Piselli, 2009 ). The insignificance of human capital in the cointegrating relationship may be related to the evidence presented above that human capital may not in fact have a unit root in all panels before time-demeaning the variable. 25 The varied performance of the DOLS approach leads us to focus our analysis on the less restricted PMG estimator."}, {"section_title": "Baseline PMG Estimations", "text": "The results for the main PMG estimations are found in the main text.

They nevertheless concluded, as we do here, that the evidence is for the existence of longrun relationships among the data. 23 The number of leads and lags in each DOLS estimation was selected based on the SBIC. 24 The conventional wisdom (and much empirical evidence) holds that labor's share of output is about twice capital's share of output in the US economy. 25 The DOLS estimates shown in to the reader to be the case in the ARDL specification (equation (3) in the main text). However, under the lag lengths chosen by the SBIC for the main specifications this is not the case. 27 Assuming that the statistics are independent random variables for simplicity, the probability that zero, one, or two statistics have p-values less than 0.05 can be readily computed. Then subtracting the sum of the probabilities from one yields the probability that three or more tests out of the 196 will falsely reject. Further details of the calculation are available upon request. 28 In fact, the same back of the envelope calculation shows that the probability of observing 10 false rejections out of all 204 tests is 57.1%.
