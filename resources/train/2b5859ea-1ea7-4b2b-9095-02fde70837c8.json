Although gasoline and Other cost-of-living differentials ma y decline in the long term. decreasing milk to feed price ratios (USDA-NASS, 2008b ) support the need for major shifts in thinking and practice among dairy farmers.\nCorn area in time United States increased b y 19 and 10% in 2007 and 2008, respectively, compared with corn area planted ill (IJSDA-NRCS. 2008 ). The increase in corn area and the corresponding increase ill application are detrimental to downstream waters, many of which are alread y nutrient-stressed (Simpson et al., 2008) . New York State dair y farniers are beginning to move small quantities of good quality grassland into corn production and transition more marginal. uncultivated land into grassland. From 2005 to 2007, the increases in areas of total corn harvested in New York State and in Delaware Count y (NY) were 26,305 ha (7%) and 283 ha (10% . ), respectivel y (USDA-NASS, 2008c).

ME, MD, MA. NH, N,T, NY, NC. PA. RI. SC.VT. VA , and WV). Approximately 78 and 14% of the Northeast's dairy farimis have <100 cows and between 100 and 199 cows. respectively (USDA-NASS. 20091)).

The main changes that farmers began to pmmrsue involved increasing coin silage hectares, adopting notill management, or substituting small grains for corn grain in the ration. A single management change was made in each simulation scenario to enable determination of individual effects of each management change on the farms. Farm strategy descriptions are presented in Table 1 . Base2008X.

No-till practices tend to reduce soil erosion, inprove soil physical structure, conserve soil water, and restore organic iiia,tter (Lal et al.. 2004: Wright and Hons. 2004) . No-till has also been reported to potentially reduce atmospheric CO2 through increased carbon sequestration (Bossuyt et al.. 2002; Cahleira et al.. 2004) . Moreover. rising costs of energy and fuel provide ail incentive to reduce tractor use wherever possible. All oilier conditions were kept the same as in Base2008X.\nX+cover. This scenario assesses the expected environinental benefits of planting cover crops on bare corn fields during the fall and winter seasons. Reported benefits of cover crops include reduced transport of sediment from fields (Mutchier and McDowell. 1990: Dabney et al.. 2001) and increased nutrient use efficiencies (Reicosky and Forcella. 1998). Mowing versus other mechanical methods of killing the cover crop has been shown to improve soil moisture and timing of cover crop N release with respect to corn N needs and lessen regrowth. In this scenario, winter re was planted on all corn fields froin Base2008X as a cover crop. These cover crops were mowed and residues were left on the ground as mulch. The soil was conventionall y tilled and conditioned directly before the corn was planted. All other conditions were kept the same as Base2008X.\n+smgrn. Producing small grain on marginal lands of Base2008 was considered as an alternative to expanding corn land (Base2008X). For this study, oat grain was selected over other small grains because it is has been found to grow well in the cool, moist climates and lower soil pI-1 levels (acidic glacial tills) that are common to Delaware Count y. Areas used for corn silage or any other production purposes were not altered from Base2008. Instead, marginal areas of 12 and 8 ha, respectively. for R-fann and W-farnm were placed into oat grain production for use as supplementary feed. In New York. niore land is available for oat grain production than for expanding corn silage production because oat grains require relatively lower land quality compared With corn. The proposed increase in oat grain production is especially beneficial to farms that do not have additional suitable land available for corn production. By producing oat grains oil lands and substituting oat grains for corn grain in the feed, farms can purchase less hi gh-priced corn grain. No-till practice was employed for oat establishment.\n+rrmilk. Increasing milk production of Base2008 was considered as a means of increasing net return of the farm. Based oil of CCE personnel, who have worked closely with these farmers, a 5% milk production increase was a level that could be potentiall y achieved by farms in the region, if the y chose to focus efforts in that direction. The milk production level of R-farmn was increased from 8.966 to 9,414 L/vr per cow. For \\\\-farm. milk production was increased froni 6.413 to 6,731 L/yr per cow. Oil cows ill and W-farm were allowed to consume 0.4 and 0.6 kg/d, respectivel y. more purchased corn grain in their diet compared with those oil (bets to achieve increased milk production levels. Additional assumptions made, thou-11 not explicitl y immodehed, were the use of more productionfocused management techniques, such as robust or long da y lighting and increased milking frequenc y. In both farms. on-farm produced feeds and any forage sold offfarin were kept the same as in Base2008.\n+PFM. Following ('CE guidelines. this PFM-based scenario involved increasing grass productivity, feeding cows a high-forage diet. and reducing dietary P levels for dair y cattle by 22% from the baseline scenario to match P levels reconmumended for dairy aninials by time National Research Council (NBC, 2001).

The reduction achieved in corn graill purchases in X+PFM over \u00b1PFM was greater than the reduction of corn grain purchases achieved by putting a.dditiouial land into corn production ill (with no PF1\\l strategies) over Base2008. This was because of the improved grass crop quality and feeding rate of the PFM scenarios compared with the Base2005. Base2008. and Base2008X scenarios. Because, more grain was required to achieve the milk production levels in the baseline than in the PPM-based scenarios. the increased corn silage yield ill still replaced less corn grain than it did in the 2 corn-growing PFM-based scenarios.

Overall, changes were slightly more moderate in the winter for B-farm and in the non-winter for \\V-farni. The increases in corn silage for the PFM scenarios in W-farm inaY have been because of the need for more carbohydrate by rumen microbes in order for them to utilize the greater amounts of ruiinnallv available N provided by the increased intake of hay crop silage. When additional corn silage was produced iii conjunction with PFM practices (high-quality, high-forage. and reduced dietar P), more on-farm produced ('0111 silage was available to be fed.

The X+PFM scenario consisted of high-forage diets with average F:C ratios of 80:20 and 88:12 for B-farm and W-farmn. respectively. across the winter and non-winter feeding periods. Also. to achieve modeled milk production levels, IFSM sirnulated slightly greater total DM1 as the forage feeding rate increased in X+PFM.\nIn contrast, i ll (when the baseline corn area was converted to grass ill addition to the PFM practices of +PFM).

The \\V-farin was more evenly balanced in the changes in dietary energy needed to go from +PFM to X+PFM (decrease corn grain by 1 kg/cl per cow) or Grass+PFM (increase corn grain by 0.9 lcg/d per cow)."}, {"section_title": "Economic Impacts", "text": "Rising feed prices have kill effect oil the dairy farms gross profitability. Tim 2005, purchased feed accounted for 25 and 23% of total production costs on B.-fiuni and \\V-farni. respectively (Table 4 ).

Hence, a price change for any of these feed components can significantly affect dair y f'am'ni profit margins.\nBecause of current price increases of farm production factors including feed, fuel, and fertilizers (as modeled by Base2008), the farms' aimual net profits were predicted to decline by 28% ($122/cow) and 40% ($42/ cow) for 11-farm and W-farni. respectivel y, despite the higher milk prices.

Oil annual corn grain consumption b y R-fai'm and W-farm was equivalent to 1.9 t/cow and 0.65 t/ cow. respectively (Table 2 ). The S115/t DM increase in corn grain prices, as modeled b y Base2008. raised feed annual supplemental fee costs b y $220/cow fcr R-farm and $75/cow for W-farm. Thus, increases ill annual cost of corn grain accounted for 39 and 17%. respectively. of total increases in supplemental feed costs (Table  2) . Overall, purchased feed costs for R-farin increased from 25% (Base 2005) to 36% of total production costs. Purchased feed costs for W-farm increased from 23% (Base2005) to 34% of total production costs.\nThe economic predictions in 13a.se2008 reflect the expected losses of net income due mainly to increased feed costs. Increasing corn silage production (Base200SX) enabledR.-farni and \\V-farm to reduce annual corn grain purchases, saving R-fa.rm $11 2/cow and \\V-farin $36/cow in purchased feed costs. Despite additional farm operation costs required in Base2008X to produce additional corn silage, including purchased fertilizer, fuel, machinery. storage, and labor. net returns for Base2008X increased by $66/cow for fl-farm and by $30/ cow for W-farm compared wit Ii Base2008. These gains in net return, however, covered onl y 51 and 71% of the $122/cow and $42/cow losses predicted due to the corn price increase from Base2005 to Ba.se2008. for fl-farm and \\V-ta.rm. resj.)ectivelv.

Oil other hand, growing cover crops oil hare corn fields (lining the fall and winter seasons (X+cover) resulted in a decline in net return because of increased operation costs required for planting, mowing, and killing the cover crops. Because covercrop herbicides are used sporadically in this region, the costs of herbicides were not included iii the economic analysis for this scenario. However. when herbicides are used, the net returns are expected to be even less than those presented in X+coveu'.\nGrowing small grains 01111 iargimial lands increased annual net returns by $70/cow fdr H-farm and $69/cow for W-farnu compared with Base2(.)08, largel y by reducing the amount of purchased grail! feed supplement.

Results of this study showed that despite higher fertilizer N costs and the additional fuel needed to harvest grass multiple times, it was still more profitable to invest in high-quality forage than adopt the other alternative strategies studied.\nThe percentage of total feed costs spent on protein supplements is substantial: 52% for R-fam'mn and 71% for \\V-fam'm in Base2005. Implementing PFM strategies often reduces protein supplement costs, counteracting other price increases that are expected to cause net losses in profit. This was demonstrated in +PFM for both fa.rnms, where the farm miet. returns increased almost 66 and 230% compared with Base2005. the scenario before costs of feeds, fuel, milk, and fertilizer price were adjusted.\nIn X+PF]\\I. when fam'nis produced more corn silage by expanding land in corn pm'oductiomm. in conjunction with produciand g an usin g hi gh-quality grass forages (Mil) .

With Hie corn area expansion, corn silage accounted for 11 to 12% of the cultivated crop area but 47 to 74% of the erosion and 40 to 63% sedinient -bound P loss (Table 5 ). This demonstrates the significant need for nianagement strategies oii corn fields (with or without expansion) to control the high sediment and sediment-hound P losses.\nIiuplenwilting no-till (X-+-not.ill) on R-farni corn fields controlled 91% of the erosion that would have occurred from time corn production fields.

As a. result. the P balance of R-fnnn was predicted to increase by 0.2 kg/ha nmder the nonexpanded PFM practice (+PFM) and by 8.7 kg/ha in Base2008. Under the expansion of corn land (X+PFM).

With the addition of the cover crop (X+cover) and application of the corresponding necessary fertilizer, the N balance increased from Basc2008X levels by 21 kg/ha for R-farm and 2 kg/ha for W-farm. However, the addition of the cover crop also increased crop N use, thus decreasing N leaching by about 4 kg/ha compared with Base2008. The PFM-based corn scenarios increased N balance from the non-PFM scenarios by about. 50 kg/ha (Rfarm) and 80 kg/ha (W-farm). Nitrogen leaching increased by about :3 kg/ha compared with the baseline. Among all scenarios, the all-grass. PPM-based scenario (Grass+PFM) caused the largest increases in the N balance from Base2008 (67 kg/ha for R-farni and 92 kg/ha for W-farm). In the PFM scenarios, particularly the all-grass scenario, N fertilizer was added to improve grass forage quality. With the implementation of these PPM-based managements, it is important to consider management practices to better match N availability to crop needs to control N leaching arid increase efficiency of N use for all forage production levels.\nSwitching from conventional tillage to no-till (X+notill), adding a conventionally tilled cover crop (X+cover), or converting corn areas to all grass under PFM (Grass+PFM) reduced both erosion and sediment-bound P losses when compared not only to the basic corn-expansion strategy (Base2008X), but also to the original land area modeled in Base2005 and Base2008.

Implementations of 110-till and cover-crop management on existing and expanded corn fields reduced soil arid water degradation. The PFM practices improved the farm P balance by nlmnnizmg P imports. This led to less excess P in nianure and fertilizer, which in turn decreased erosion and sedi iment-bound P losses compared with when PFM was not used. In addition.

Alternatives such as growing additional small grains oil lands and increasing milk production levels also demonstrated potential for increasing farm profitability but did not minimize the farm P balance or improve economic efficiency by producing higher quality forage on existing forage crops. Overall, it is crucial that conservation measures such as no-till and cover cropping he implemented on new or existing corn lands as these areas provide hi g h potential for P losses through runoff. No-till small grains oil ginal lands, in place of expanded corn silage lands. may be more profitable amid mniore emmvironmnentall y friendly on some farms.
