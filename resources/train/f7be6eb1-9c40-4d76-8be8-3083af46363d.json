There is great interest in understanding the progression of biological and cognitive markers (collectively referred to as 5 biomarkers in this paper) that are implicated in AD in the earliest stages, given that therapeutic intervention is hypothesized to be more effective if administered early in the disease before downstream brain damage occurs. Such an understanding will enable a better definition of preclinical AD and help identify individuals who are likely to benefit from therapy. 10 In studies of dominantly inherited AD, parents' ages at disease onset serve as strong predictors of an individual's onset age, allowing the use of time from expected onset as a surrogate of disease progression against which biomarker trajectories can be characterized [2] . However, in sporadic AD, such an estimate is not as good an indicator of expected onset, making it difficult to characterize 15 biomarker evolution in the earliest stages of neuropathology and neurodegeneration that mark the preclinical stages of AD. Furthermore, differences across individuals in the rate of disease progression make it difficult to characterize a quantitative template (QT) of biomarker changes as a function of disease state. Therefore, it is necessary to use novel statistical approaches that take into 20 account such differences across individuals for combining short-term follow-up data per individual to reveal long-term biomarker trajectories.\nSeveral studies have addressed this challenge of characterizing biomarker trajectories in preclinical stages of AD as a function of an underlying latent disease progression variable that reflects the natural history of AD neuropathology, 25 neurodegeneration, and cognitive changes via generative models. These models emphasize the interpretability of model results rather than optimization of predictive performance, where discriminative methods might outperform but produce results that are not as easily interpretable. Existing generative models of AD progression can be divided into two major categories based on the granularity 30 of their characterization of the latent disease progression variable, either as a sequence of discrete events [3] [4] [5] or as a continuous variable [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . In addition to characterizing changes in biomarker trajectories as a function of latent disease stages, these statistical models provide individualized information that can be used for personalized disease staging and monitoring. 35 Recent work in this area has focused on Bayesian reformulations of statistical approaches to biomarker trajectory modeling [11, 14, 15] to enable probabilistic estimates of trajectories and better characterization of the individual-level uncertainty in disease progression variables. These improvements can lead to better disease monitoring and progression prediction at the individual level, 40 thereby providing useful tools for clinical trial recruitment and assessment. We further this line of research into continuous latent disease progression models by reformulating our Progression Score Model [6, 7] as a Bayesian model, and make substantial changes to improve the interpretability of our results. First, we impose weakly informative priors on model parameters. This allows us to compute credible intervals around estimated trajectories and individualized disease stage indicators. Second, based on our earlier observation that rate of progression is associated with disease stage, we revise the transformation between age and the latent disease progression variable, so that biomarker trajectories can be depicted as a function of time to diagnosis, which was not directly possible in 50 our previous model.\nUsing this Bayesian Progression Score Model, we compute a QT of the temporal evolution of AD-related biomarkers by temporally aligning longitudinal data for individuals based on the similarity of a collection of biomarkers for individuals who are cognitively normal, have mild cognitive impairment (MCI) 55 or AD dementia. The QT reflects change in biomarkers as a function of a latent disease stage indicator that is simultaneously estimated per individual in the model. Unlike Bayesian models proposed by Li et al. [11] or Lorenzi et al. [15] , where estimated biomarker trajectories are presented only in terms of the latent disease progression variable, our model enables the characterization 60 of the trajectories in time domain, thereby facilitating the interpretation and applicability of our results to clinical settings. Our use of basis functions for depicting the time courses of biomarkers allow to capture more flexible trajectories than those possible with the parametric form proposed by Ishida et al. [14] . The estimated temporal QT shows that verbal memory decline is detectable early on the trajectory to MCI and AD. The temporal evolution is also marked by changes in hippocampal volume, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid (A\u03b2 1-42 ), total tau (t-tau) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau 181p ), as well as brain glucose metabolism and global measures of cognition and mental status. We demonstrate that the estimated latent disease progression variable is associated with known 70 risk factors for late-onset AD and clinical diagnosis. Finally, we predict AD dementia onset age using baseline data in a disjoint testing set, achieving a root mean square error of < 1.5 years. Our results provide insights into the natural history of late-onset Alzheimer's disease starting with the preclinical stages. The estimated QT can be used to estimate individualized latent disease stages given 75 a collection of biomarker measurements and predict future conversion to AD."}, {"section_title": "Method", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu). The ADNI was launched in 2003 as a public-private partnership, led by Principal Investigator 80 Michael W. Weiner, MD. The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of MCI and early AD. Specifically, we used the ADNI data prepared for the Alzheimer's Disease Modelling Challenge 85 and followed the recommendations prescribed in this document for easing the comparison with other quantitative templates for the progression of AD.\nParticipants. We used data for 1706 participants with 6880 visits from ADNI 1/GO/2. Clinical diagnoses of MCI and AD dementia were determined by the ADNI Conversion Committee according to the criteria described in the ADNI protocol. We 90 designated data for approximately 80% of the individuals selected at random as the training set (1369 individuals with 5533 visits). We designated the data for the remaining individuals, excluding 67 individuals with AD at baseline, as the testing set (270 individuals with 1165 visits) for evaluating the performance of age at AD onset prediction. Participant demographics are presented in Table 1 . 95 We compared demographic variables by diagnostic category using Wilcoxon rank-sum test for continuous variables and Fisher's exact test for categorical variables.\nBiomarkers and cognitive measures. We computed a QT of the temporal evolution of the following AD-related biomarkers: CSF A\u03b2 1-42 , p-tau 181p , t-tau; 100 intracranial volume-adjusted hippocampal volume; brain glucose metabolism measured by fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET; verbal memory measured by Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) immediate recall (sum score across 5 learning trials) [16] [18] , and the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) [19] . These measures were selected based on their demonstrated involvement in the progression of AD, and closely mirror those selected for analysis with an earlier version of our model [6] . We selected visits with at least 5 of these 9 measures for inclusion in 110 our analysis.\nProgression score model. We reformulated the previously described Progression Score Model [6, 7] using a Bayesian framework where biomarker trajectories are modeled using basis functions. Compared to linear or sigmoid functions used in our previous applications, basis functions allow for much richer models of 115 biomarker trajectories. We make the following modeling assumptions:\n1.

Continuous-time model. We first describe the model in continuous time. We then discretize it for fitting the parameters. The model describes biomarker values collectively as a function of age using a two-level composition. First, there is a subject-dependent exponential mapping of age t to progression score (PS) s:\nwhere \u03b1 > 0 is a global parameter and \u03b3 > 0 is a subject-specific variable. t 0 is a fixed age, here t 0 = 70, so that \u03b3 is the progression score at 70 years.

The subject-specific model is:\nwhere t ij is the age of subject i at visit j, and |N | is the half-normal distribution.

Given K biomarkers, their trajectory models parameterized by \u03c9 are given 130 by:\nwhere \u039b is a diagonal matrix with \u039b kk = \u03bb k , C is a correlation matrix, and LKJ is the random correlation matrix distribution described by Lewandowski et al.\n[20].

In the absence of data, these priors slightly favor flat \"trajectories\" for the biomarkers.\nModel fitting. We conducted Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling to generate posterior samples, using the No-U-Turn Sampler step method [21] for continuous variables, and a Metropolis-within-Gibbs step method optimized for binary variables for \u03c0 k . Non-negative variables were log-transformed to allow for 150 unconstrained optimization. For visits with missing biomarker measurements, only the available measurements contributed to the model fitting procedure. We used the PyMC3 Python package for model specification and fitting [22] . Model fitting was performed using training data. We used Z = 5 logistic bases, with z equally spaced between 0 and 10 and 155 \u03c3 2 basis = 1.

For tuning the sampling parameters, we obtained 300 samples, which were then discarded. The following 300 samples were used for model parameter estimation. 160 2. Next, we removed the constraint fixing the correlation matrix C. Samples obtained from the previous step were used to initialize \u03c9 k , \u03bb k , \u03b1 i , \u03b2 i , \u03c0 k , and missing biomarker observations y ijk . We continued to fix \u03c3 \u03b1 = 0.05 and \u03c3 \u03b3 = 5.0. This model was fitted using the longitudinal data set, with 200 tuning + 200 samples. Prediction of time to diagnosis. Age at the first occurrence of an AD dementia diagnosis for each individual who is NL or MCI at baseline was considered as 185 the age at dementia onset. Using the known age at dementia onset data in the training set, we trained a linear regression model with time to dementia onset from baseline as the outcome and baseline progression score as the independent variable.\nTo make predictions for time to dementia onset in the testing set, we first 190 used baseline age and baseline biomarkers to compute a progression score for each individual given the trained progression score model. The trained linear regression model was then applied to these baseline progression scores to make predictions for time to dementia onset for each individual in the testing set. We assessed the performance of our onset age estimation by computing the 195 root mean square error (RMSE) between the predicted and observed onset ages for individuals whose onset ages are known (i.e., for whom diagnostic conversion was observed in the longitudinal data set). This analysis is a biased reflection of the accuracy of onset age prediction given that it is restricted to those who convert to AD. To obtain measures based on all individuals regardless of their 200 conversion status, we estimated Kaplan-Meier survival curves based on our predictions and observed onset ages. Survival curve estimation incorporates data for all individuals by assuming that AD conversion will occur after the last visit for individuals who did not convert during the study. For computing the Kaplan-Meier curves using observed data, event was defined as the first visit with an 205 AD diagnosis following a visit with an NL or MCI diagnosis. We right-censored using age at last visit if the individual remained NL or MCI. For computing the Kaplan-Meier curves using predicted data, if onset was \"predicted\" to occur prior to baseline visit, age at onset was set to baseline age. We right-censored using age at last visit if the predicted onset age was greater than the age at last 210 visit. We compared these two curves using the log-rank test \u03c7 2 statistic. We repeated the linear regression models using age, each biomarker, age + each biomarker, all biomarkers, age + all biomarkers as independent variable(s). We also ran linear regression models using PS and its combinations with age and/or \u03b3 as independent variable(s). An intercept was included in all linear 215 regression models. We then used permutation tests to compare the RMSE and \u03c7 2 of the best model without PS to those of the best model with PS. The permutation test involved randomly swapping the onset ages predicted by the models being compared and computing the differences in RMSE and \u03c7 2 between the two models. This was repeated 2000 times to obtain a distribution for 220 RMSE difference and a distribution for \u03c7 2 difference under the null hypothesis of equality between models. The observed difference was then quantified against this null distribution using a two-tailed test.\nReproducible research.

Older age, male sex, fewer years of education, number of APOE \u03b54 alleles, and MCI or AD diagnoses were associated with higher PS at baseline ( Table 2 ). Fig. 3 . Among prediction models that did not include PS as an independent variable, the model with the lowest \u03c7 2 was the one with all 9 biomarkers (\u03c7 2 = 20.5, RMSE = 1.58), whereas additionally including age yielded the model with the lowest RMSE (\u03c7 2 = 21.1, RMSE = 1.57) ( Table 3 ).

We demonstrated that progression along our estimated temporal QT reflects AD processes by showing its association 275 with clinical diagnosis and known AD risk factors, as well as by quantifying the accuracy of our model in predicting age at onset of AD dementia. The ability of our model to leverage short-term data to obtain long-term biomarker trajectories is highly relevant to the current need in clinical trial design for predicting who will develop cognitive impairment and AD dementia over time. 280 We found that the PS computed based on AD-related neuropathology, neurodegeneration, and cognitive measures were associated with age, APOE \u03b54 positivity, which is the most influential known genetic risk factor for sporadic AD [23] , and clinical diagnoses of MCI and AD. We also observed higher PS among men and a negative association between PS and years of education."}, {"section_title": "285", "text": "Associations with APOE \u03b54 and clinical diagnoses provided evidence that our QT, which was constructed without these pieces of information, is reflective of AD progression. While we recognize that there is heterogeneity in individual presentations across the biomarkers considered in our model and that not every individual included in our analyses is necessarily on an AD pathway, the strong 290 associations we observed between PS and AD diagnosis as well as AD risk factors suggest that the estimated trajectories are mainly indicative of age-and disease-related changes that occur along the progression towards AD dementia.\nOur QT was consistent with our previous findings in ADNI [6] . By modifying our previously described Progression Score Models [6, 7] to include a global pa-295 rameter governing the relationship between disease stage and rate of progression, we were able to depict biomarker trajectories as a function of time from AD diagnosis. This innovation enabled a more easily interpretable characterization of the natural history of AD starting in preclinical stages.\nOur method achieved < 1. biomarker changes from a cognitively normal state to AD dementia. It is known that there is heterogeneity in longitudinal progression in AD. Studying individuals who deviate from the estimated QT may be informative in understanding this heterogeneity, and models that relax the assumption of a single progression pathway will be necessary for a detailed analysis. We observed the greatest 315 variability around trajectory estimates for CSF A\u03b2 1-42 . This suggests that the timing of CSF A\u03b2 1-42 can vary at the individual level in relation to changes in other biomarkers included in this study. Another limitation of our study is that higher PS indicates both age-and AD-related changes in the examined biomarkers.\nUnderstanding changes that occur with AD as distinct from age-related changes 320 is clinically important. However, this is a challenging goal given that there is no scientific consensus regarding the definition of healthy aging. Several studies have approached this problem by including age and other demographic variables as covariates in addition to a disease stage variable [11, 25, 26] or by regressing out their effects prior to model fitting [5, 27, 28] , whereas others have not included 325 covariates in order to characterize trajectories that explain the natural history of AD dementia, including biological and cognitive changes that occur due to aging in addition to AD [4, 6-9, 13, 15] . We formulated our goal with this study as the characterization of the natural history of AD dementia, including biological and cognitive changes that occur due to aging in addition to AD pathology, 330 and therefore did not include an adjustment for age or any other demographic variables.\nIn conclusion, our method allows for the estimation of individualized latent disease progression indicators and population-level biomarker trajectories from longitudinal data. The estimated temporal QT of AD provides a mechanism 335 for localizing individuals along biomarker trajectories based on multivariate data. Individualized progression scores can be used longitudinal composites to investigate associations with risk factors and outcomes. Furthermore, the ability to obtain individualized estimates of age at AD onset can allow for better participant recruitment in clinical trials aimed at preclinical AD. "}]
