Regression models have been investigated to predict clinical scores from individual magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and/or positron emission tomography (PET) scans [14, 17, 18, 24] . In [17] , stepwise regression was performed in a univariate, pairwise fashion to relate each imaging measure to each cognitive score. In [14] , using relevance vector regression, morphometric features of the entire brain were jointly analyzed to predict each selected clinical score. Two most recent studies [18, 24] employed multi-task learning strategies and aimed to select features that could predict all or most clinical scores, using \u2113 2,1 -norm coupled with \u2113 1 -norm [18] and multi-task feature selection coupled with support vector machine [24] . Both methods used a simple concatenation to bundle multiple clinical scores together without learning their dependence relation.\nIn this study we propose a new sparse Bayesian multitask learning method, which is built on a multivariate regression model and explicitly models the correlation structure within each row of the regression coefficient matrix. This is motivated by the fact that if a biomarker plays a role in one score of a cognitive test, then it often has more or less influence in another score of the same test. The proposed method is evaluated in an empirical study using the MRI and cognitive data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database [19] . This method not only demonstrates superior performance over multiple state-of-the-art competing methods, but also identifies cognition-relevant imaging biomarkers that are consistent with prior knowledge."}, {"section_title": "Sparse Bayesian Multi-Task Learning", "text": "The multiple measurement vector (MMV) model, originally designed for sparse signal recovery [5] , is adopted here for multivariate regression of cognitive scores Y on neuroimaging measures \u03a6:\nwhere \u03a6 \u2208 R N \u00d7M and Y \u2208 R N \u00d7L are respectively the M neuroimaging measures and L cognitive scores of the N subjects, V is an unknown noise matrix (or called model error matrix), and X \u2208 R M \u00d7L is an unknown coefficient matrix. X is expected to have a sparse loading (i.e., only a few nonzero rows), since the brain circuitry relevant to a certain cognition task typically involves a small number of imaging markers, and these markers more or less affect all the cognitive scores under the task. Here a nonzero row is allowed to contain some zero entries.\nThere are many algorithms for this problem. Most of them calculate the solution by solving the following unconstrained problem (or its equivalent constrained problem)\nwith the mixed \u2113 q,1 penalty (typically, q = 2 or q = \u221e)\nwhere an \u2113 q norm is applied on each row of X, and an \u2113 1 norm is applied on the M calculated \u2113 q norms. \u03bb is a regularizer, which is generally tuned by cross-validation. Algorithms using this penalty include group Lasso (the variant used for the MMV model) [23] , MMV based Basis Pursuit (M-BP) [4] , and many domain-specific algorithms for feature extraction [13] . Note that the penalty g 1 (X) is a convex penalty. In some scenarios non-convex penalty based algorithms can yield better performance. A typical non-convex penalty is:\nThe MMV based FOCal Underdetermined System Solver (M-FOCUSS) method [5] is a representative in this group. However, instead of using these algorithms in our problem, we prefer the T-MSBL 2 algorithm [26] , a recently derived variant in the family of sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) [15] . SBL is a powerful approach for regression and classification. It relies on a parameterized prior that encourages models with a few nonzero rows in X (i.e. encourages row-wise sparsity). But among various SBL algorithms we prefer T-MSBL due to the following specific reasons.\nFirst, in our case a given imaging marker can affect multiple cognitive scores, so the coefficients in the same row of X are largely correlated. Recently, it has been found [26] that when such correlation is present, most existing methods have seriously degraded performance due to the ignorance of the correlation 3 . In contrast, T-MSBL can adaptively estimate and exploit the correlation structure in X i\u00b7 (\u2200i) to improve performance. Extensive experiments have verified its superior performance to most algorithms.\nSecond, in our case the columns of \u03a6 is highly coherent. In some data sets used in our experiments the maximum correlation reaches 0.95. The coherent \u03a6 can result in poor performance of most algorithms. In contrast, experiments have shown that T-MSBL maintains its superior performance in this situation.\nThird, T-MSBL has an effective learning rule to choose a suitable value for the regularizer \u03bb. This relaxes the efforts of users to choose a value for \u03bb as in many algorithms (e.g. M-BP and M-FOCUSS).\nHowever, the T-MSBL is slow due to the use of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) method. In the following, we first briefly describe T-MSBL, and then propose a much faster algorithm, which is suitable for large-scale data sets. Further, we reveal its connection to some popular algorithms, including those using the mixed \u2113 2,1 penalty (3) and those using kernels for regularization. This connection provides insights to the advantages of the proposed algorithm, and motivates the design of new algorithms in the future."}, {"section_title": "The T-MSBL Algorithm", "text": "In T-MSBL, each row X i\u00b7 is assumed to satisfy a parameterized Gaussian distribution, given by\nwhere \u03b3 i and B i are hyperparameters. \u03b3 i is a nonnegative scalar controlling the row sparsity of X. When \u03b3 i = 0, the corresponding i-th row, X i\u00b7 , becomes zero. Due to the mechanism of automatic relevance determination [12, 15] , most \u03b3 i become zero in noiseless cases or tend to very small values in noisy cases. Generally a threshold is used to prune out these \u03b3 i , which equivalently prunes out the corresponding rows in X. B i is an unknown positive definite matrix modeling correlation structure in X i\u00b7 , which is adaptively learned from data. It is worthy of emphasizing that the dataadaptive learning of the correlation structure is very important, which can effectively prevent T-MSBL from converging to local solutions in most cases [26] .\nTo conveniently derive T-MSBL, the MMV model (1) is equivalently transformed to the block sparsity model\nwhere\nHere v is assumed to be a Gaussian distribution p(v; \u03bb) = N (0, \u03bbI). Using the Bayes rule, the posterior is p(x|y; \u0398) = N (\u00b5, \u03a3) with\nwhere \u0398 denotes the set of all the hyperparameters {\u03bb, \u03b3 i , B i , \u2200i}, and\nOnce these hyperparameters are estimated, the estimate of x is readily given by the mean of the posterior, i.e. \u00b5. The original T-MSBL uses the EM method to estimate these hyperparameters, and thus it is slow. In the following we will derive a much faster algorithm based on MacKay's fixedpoint method [11] ."}, {"section_title": "The New Algorithm: T-MSBL-FP", "text": "We estimate the hyperparameters in the evidence maximization framework [11, 15] .

To conveniently derive learning rules for these hyperparameters, we first simplify L(\u0398). First, note that\nwhere (10) and (11) both used the equation (6), and (12) 4 We denote the L \u00d7 L identity matrix by I L . When the dimension is evident from the context, we simply use I. \u2297 denotes the Kronecker product. vec(\u00b7) denotes the vectorization of a matrix formed by stacking its columns into a single column vector.\nused the equation (7). Next, using the Sylvester's Determinant Theorem, we have\nCombining (12) and (13), the cost function becomes\nNow it is convenient to minimize the cost function with respect to each hyperparameter. The derivative of L(\u0398) with respect to \u03b3 i is \nSimilarly, we derive the learning rules for B and \u03bb:\nThe learning rules (6), (7), (15), (16) , and (17) comprise our algorithm. This algorithm operates in the block sparsity model (5) , not the original MMV model (1). But we can simplify it using the approximation equation [26] :\nThis approximation performs quite well over a broader range of conditions, especially when SNR is high or the correlation in each X i\u00b7 is weak. It becomes exact when \u03bb = 0 or B = I. Using (18) and following the simplification procedure in [26] we obtain the simplified algorithm as follows:\nwhere \u039e ii is the (i, i)-th element of \u039e. We call the algorithm T-MSBL-FP (i.e, T-MSBL-Fixed Point). Note that the robustness of the \u03bb learning rule in noisy environment can be improved by setting the off-diagonal elements of \u03a6\u0393\u03a6 T to zeros [26] . Also, the robustness of the learning rule for B can be improved by adopting the regularization method in [26] . The initialization values of \u03b3 i (\u2200i), B, and \u03bb can be chosen 1, I, and any guessed noise variance, respectively.\nT-MSBL-FP not only is much faster than T-MSBL, but also has better prediction performance. More interestingly, from its cost function (9) we can connect it to many wellestablished algorithms, providing insights to our algorithm and motivations to design new algorithms. We elaborate this next."}, {"section_title": "Connection to Existing Algorithms", "text": "Our motivation of connecting T-MSBL-FP to existing algorithms is inspired by the work in [20, 25] . In [20] Wipf and Nagarajan connected the basic SBL algorithm [15] to \u2113 1 minimization algorithms in the single measurement vector model, a related but different model to the MMV model considered here. In [25] Zhang and Rao connected T-MSBL to iterative reweighted \u2113 2 algorithms. Now we connect T-MSBL-FP to the algorithms based on the \u2113 q,1 penalty (3) and those employing kernel regularizers [22, 13, 21] .\nWe consider to transform the cost function (9) . Using the identity y\n, the upper-bound of the cost function (9) is\nBy first minimizing it over \u03b3 and B and then minimizing over x, we have:\nwith the penalty g C (x) given by\n6 \u03b3 \u227d 0 means each element of \u03b3 is nonnegative. B \u227b 0 means B is a positive definite matrix.\nWe now look at the concavity of g C (x). Since the function h(\u03b3) log |\u03bbI + D\u03a3 0 D T | is concave and nondecreasing with respect to \u03b3 \u227d 0, we have\nwhere h * (z) is the concave conjugate of h(\u03b3) [2] , and\nT . Thus using (21) we can express (20) as\nwhere\nSubstituting this expression into (22) leads to\nNow, from (19) and (24) we have:\nTo obtain the solution x, we need to first calculate the optimal values of B and z i . The optimal value of B can be obtained from (20) . Note that\n, where D i = \u03a6 i \u2297 I L and \u03a6 i is the i-th column of \u03a6. Setting it to zero, we have\nwhere (26) used the approximation (18) . Thus, we obtain the learning rule\nwith C\nAccording to the duality property [2] in convex optimization, from the relation (21) we can directly obtain the optimal z i as follows\nwhere we used the approximation (18) again. Based on the above development, we see that the optimal values of B and z i depend on X itself. Thus the whole learning procedure is an iterative algorithm. In the k-th iteration, once having used the updating rules (23) (27) and (28) to obtain B (k) and the weight w\ni , we only need to solve the following optimization problem:\nor equivalently,\nNow we draw its connection to existing algorithms. First, from (30) we can see our penalty is a correlationaware penalty, and the correlation structure is adaptively learned from data. This is entirely different to the penalties in (3) and (4), which is blind to the correlation. Further, the matrix B (k) in our penalty can be viewed as a dataadaptive kernel. This is different to the non-adaptive kernels used in some existing \u2113 2,1 -norm penalties [22] , which generally need users to design kernels according to some a priori knowledge or by cross-validation. Note that the dataadaptive kernel is advantageous over the user-defined kernels, because in some applications such as our application, a priori knowledge may not be available. Also, user-designed kernels may not accurately capture the correlation structure of data.\nSecond, one can see (30) is an MMV-model based iterative reweighted \u2113 1 minimization algorithm [3] , since its weights w (k) i depends on the estimate of X in the previous iteration. In contrast, the framework expressed in (2)- (3) is a non-iterative-reweighted one. It is known that iterative reweighted algorithms have better performance than their non-iterative-reweighted counterparts and can provide more sparse solutions [3] .\nThe above observations give us an intuitive, although not rigorous, explanation why our algorithm has superior performance as shown in the experiments described below. And they motivate us how to improve algorithms based on the \u2113 q,1 norm and kernel regularizers, especially how to adaptively learn the correlation structure of data."}, {"section_title": "Experimental Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data Sets", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.ucla.edu).

Similar to prior studies [14, 24] , in each experiment, Pearson's correlation coefficients r between the actual and predicted cognitive scores were computed to measure the prediction performance. Using a 5-fold cross-validation strategy, the testing samples across five trials were pulled together to obtain an unbiased estimate of these correlation coefficients.\nShown in Table 2 (b) is the performance comparison among all seven methods. Both T-MSBL-FP and T-MSBL outperformed the other five competing algorithms in all three prediction cases. In the multi-task learning cases (i.e., RAVLT and TRAILS, where L > 1 for Y in the MMV model (1)), T-MSBL-FP outperformed T-MSBL. Besides better prediction accuracy, T-MSBL-FP also achieved significantly improved computational performance by almost one order of magnitude 7 over T-MSBL, i.e., 0.31s vs. 2.12s for MMSE, 0.11s vs. 4.68s for RAVLT, and 0.17s vs 1.36s for TRAILS.\nUsing T-MSBL-FP, the MRI measures could predict the MMSE score the best, with a correlation coefficient r = 0.7352.

MMSE measures overall cognitive impairment; and thus its result includes important AD-relevant imaging markers such as hippocampal volume, amygdala volume, and entorhinal cortex thickness. RAVLT measures verbal learning memory; and thus its result includes regions relevant to learning and memory, such as hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and middle temporal gyri. TRAILS measures a combination of visual, motor and executive functions; and thus its result includes regions in sensory-motor cortex (e.g., paracentral lobule), parietal lobe (relevant to visual processing), and frontal lobe (relevant to executive function).\nAll the above results have demonstrated that the proposed T-MSBL-FP method not only yields superior performance on prediction accuracy and computational time, but also is a powerful tool for discovering a small set of imaging biomarkers that predict cognitive performance.
