[{"section_title": "", "text": "observations revealed a somewhat different structure: the plume depth increased from 3 m near the mouth to 6 m at the offshore edge, while the salinity anomaly decreased. These changes of plume salinity and depth occurred in a step-like fashion rather than continuously. CTD profiles near these steps revealed overturning indicative of vigorous mixing. Estimates of gradient Richardson number confirmed the likelihood of mixing/entrainment not only at the offshore edge of the plume, but also in the proximity of the observed steps. These thermohaline steps appear to be quasipermanent features because estimates of the associated geostrophic shear comply well with the observed vertical shear. These steps can be related to the tidally-modulated freshwater discharge, although their exact nature is unclear. Even though the observed plume had a very small depth to width aspect ratio and was affected by the wind stress, it still exhibited its intrinsic dynamics in the form of anticyclonic flow pattern."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "The response of the anticyclonic bulge formed by tidally-modulated riverine discharge to the light upwelling-favorable wind appears to be more complex than the slab-like model suggests (Fong and Geyer, 2001;Lentz, 2004). In particular, the plume exhibits significant cross-shelf variations in its thickness and density anomaly, while mixing is not limited to the offshore edge with outcropping isopycnals. The cross-shore plume structure captured by transect C reveals the age of buoyant water: buoyant layer farther offshore has smaller salinity signature and larger thickness because of its longer exposure to the wind-induced mixing.

The theory assumes that mixing across the pycnocline is controlled by the bulk Richardson number Ri * and occurs primarily in the offshore edge of the plume, where the pycnocline outcrops to the surface and Ri * drops below the critical value due to the decreasing depth of the plume. It is also assumed that the plume has a spatially constant density anomaly and, except for the offshore edge, constant thickness, corresponding to near-critical Ri * . However, the theory does not consider the coastal source of buoyant water feeding the plume. We hypothesize that thermohaline steps seen on transects represent tidal plume fronts formed after each tidal cycle (every 12 h) and advected offshore by Ekman transport: ue= / . Assuming \u03c4y=0.04 Pa, \u03c1=1020 kg m -3 , f=9\u00d710 -5 s -1 , and h=3 m yields ue=0.15 m s -1 , which translates into a horizontal distance of~6.5 km over a 12-h time interval. This distance is close to the separation in the offshore direction between the two pycnocline steps observed at x=10 and 16 km (transect C below), and a new tidal plume front appears to be forming at x=5 km."}]
