[{"section_title": "", "text": "Since its emergence in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected \u22486 million persons worldwide. As SARS-CoV-2 spreads across the planet, we explored the range of human cells that can be infected by this virus. We isolated SARS-CoV-2 from 2 infected patients in Toronto, Canada; determined the genomic sequences; and identified single-nucleotide changes in representative populations of our virus stocks. We also tested a wide range of human immune cells for productive infection with SARS-CoV-2. We confirm that human primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells are not permissive for SARS-CoV-2. As SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread globally, it is essential to monitor single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the virus and to continue to isolate circulating viruses to determine viral genotype and phenotype by using in vitro and in vivo infection models.\nstreptomycin, and 0.05 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol.

Relative to mock-inoculated cells, cells inoculated with both samples (SARS-CoV-2/SB2 and SARS-CoV-2/ SB3-TYAGNC) displayed extensive CPE 72 h after infection (Figure 2, panel A) . We collected 200 \u03bcL of cell culture supernatant and re-infected a fresh layer of Vero E6 cells. After 24 hours, both wells containing cells that were reinoculated displayed extensive CPE (Figure 2, panel B) . We extracted viral RNA from the supernatant and confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 by using a diagnostic quantitative real-time PCR (Figure 2, panel C) . We also confirmed the presence of coronavirus-like particles in infected Vero E6 cells by electron microscopy (Figure 2, panel D) .\nNext, we performed genome sequencing of both isolates, generating genome sequences with 7,500-8,000-fold coverage and \u224894% completeness, with only \u2248260 bp and \u2248200 bp at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 termini undetermined (Table; Appendix Figure 2 ). SARS-CoV-2/ SB2 and SARS-CoV-2/SB3-TYAGNC shared synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions with those independently observed in direct sequencing of clinical isolates (Table; S. Mubareka and A.G. McArthur, unpub. data). SARS-CoV-2/SB2 also contained a nonsynonymous substitution at position 2832 (K856R in open reading frame [ORF] 1ab polyprotein) and 3 regions with mutations or a deletion supported by a minority of sequencing reads, but SARS-CoV-2/SB3-TYAGNC had only an additional synonymous substitution in ORF1ab polyprotein (Y925Y) plus a minority of sequencing reads supporting another synonymous substitution in the ORF3a protein (Table) . Furthermore, maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analysis including >1,900 SARS-CoV-2 isolates from GISAID (https:// www.gisaid.org) placed both SARS-CoV-2/SB2 and SARS-CoV-2/SB3-TYAGNC within a clade of isolates from patients around the globe but with evidence of travel history associated with the COVID-19 outbreak in Iran (Appendix Figure 2 ). As such, SARS-CoV-2/ SB3-TYAGNC was used for subsequent studies as the best representative of a clinical viral isolate. Raw sequencing reads for each isolate are available in the National Center for Biotechnology Information under BioProject PRJNA624792. Only sequencing reads that aligned by Bowtie2 to the MN908947.3 SARS-CoV-2 genome were included in the deposited sequence files.\nTo determine the replication kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 in human structural and immune cells, we infected Calu-3 cells, THF cells, Vero E6 cells (African green monkey kidney epithelial), THP-1 cells, and primary PBMCs from healthy human donors (CD4+, CD8+, CD19+, monocytes, and other PBMCs; Appendix Figure 1 ) with an MOI of 0.01. We monitored virus replication in the cell lines for 72 h (Figure 3 ). We also determined virus replication in PBMCs from healthy donors for 48 h (Figure 3 ). SARS-CoV-2 propagated to high titers in Vero E6 and Calu-3 cells (Figure 3 ). SARS-CoV-2 did not replicate efficiently in THF cells (Figure 3 ). Of note, human immune cell lines and primary PBMCs from healthy donors did not support SARS-CoV-2 replication (Figure 3) .\nTo further support virus replication data, we imaged infected human epithelial, fibroblast, and immune cells by using electron microscopy after 48 h of infection with SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 0.01 (Figure 4) . We scanned 10 different fields per cell type, each using 4 different magnifications-2,600\u00d7, 8,500\u00d7, 17,500\u00d7, and 36,000\u00d7-to determine if the cell populations contained virus-like particles. Virus-like particles were detected in 7/10 fields in Vero E6 cells and 8/10 fields in Calu-3 cells (Figure 4, panels A, B) . We also detected virus-like particles in 2/10 fields in primary CD4+ T cells (Figure 4, panel C) . We did not observe any virus-like particles in other human immune cells that were experimentally infected with SARS-CoV-2 ( Figure 4 , panels D-J). To determine if virus-like particles can be detected in Vero E6 cells and PBMCs at earlier time points, we infected these cell populations with SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 0.01 and imaged the cells with electron microscopy at 6 h and 12 h after infection (Appendix Figures 3, 4) . We observed virus-like particles in 9/10 fields at 6 h after infection and 10/10 fields at 12 h after infection in Vero E6 cells (Appendix Figure 3 , panel A, Figure  4 , panel A). We also observed virus-like particles in 1/10 fields at 6 h and 1/10 fields at 12 h after infection in CD4+ T cells (Appendix Figure 3, To confirm SARS-CoV-2 infection and protein expression in CD4+ T cells, we infected Vero E6 and CD4+ T cells with SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 0.1 for 24 h. We immunostained these cells and observed them by using fluorescent microscopy. To enhance our ability to detect SARS-CoV-2 proteins in these cells, we immunostained the cells by using a cocktail of antibodies that included SARS-CoV-2 S1 antibody, SARS-CoV-2 N antibody, and diluted serum from a recovered COVID-19 patient (Figure 1, panels A and B) . We were able to detect SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero E6 and CD4+ T cells by using this antibody cocktail ( Figure   1, panels A, B) . Furthermore, to confirm SARS-CoV-2 infection of CD4+ T cells by using a single antibody, we immunostained infected CD4+ T cells with anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 antibody and were able to detect infected cells in the population (Figure 1, panel C) ."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "We report the isolation of 2 replication competent SARS-CoV-2 virus samples from COVID-19 patients in Canada. We used TPCK-treated trypsin to facilitate virus isolation from clinical specimens ( Figure  2, panel A) . Exogenous trypsin activates SARS-CoV spike proteins more efficiently and facilitates cellular entry (21) . Exogenous trypsin treatment also enhances infectivity of other zoonotic batborne coronaviruses (22) . Furthermore, TPCK-treated trypsin has been used to successfully isolate SARS-CoV-2 in China (1). In our study, subsequent infection and virus replication did not require any additional TPCK-treated trypsin ( Figure 2, panel B) . The presence of CPE alone does not indicate successful isolation of a coronavirus. Mid-turbinate samples from adults with acute respiratory distress may often contain other microbes, including viruses (23) . Thus, to identify our cell culture isolates, we sequenced them to confirm that they were reflective of the SARS-CoV-2 infecting patients worldwide, selecting SARS-CoV-2/SB3-TYAGNC for experimental investigation because this isolate produced fewer minority sequencing reads (Table) .\nSARS-CoV caused the 2003-2004 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome. SARS-CoV can infect structural (24) and immune cell lines (25) from humans in vitro. To identify cell types that can support productive infection of SARS-CoV-2, we infected a range of human cell populations with SARS-CoV-2/SB3-TYAGNC. Both Vero E6 and Calu-3 cells supported SARS-CoV-2 replication to high titers (Figure 3 ), as reported in other recent studies (26, 27) . Previously, SARS-CoV was also shown to replicate efficiently in Vero E6 cells (24) . Vero E6 cells are immunodeficient, with deficiencies in innate antiviral interferon signaling, which makes them ideal candidates for virus isolation (28) . However, to enable studies on SARS-CoV-2-host interactions, it is important to identify human lung epithelial cells with intact immune responses that can support SARS-CoV-2 replication. We and others have previously shown that SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) replicate efficiently in Calu-3 cells (8, 29, 30) . In addition, SARS-CoV-induced and MERS-CoV-induced immune responses have been studied in Calu-3 cells (30, 31) . The ability to infect Calu-3 cells with SARS-CoV-2 ( Figure 3) will facilitate in vitro studies of virus-host interactions using SARS-CoV-2. Other commonly used human lung cells, such as A549, do not support efficient replication of SARS-CoV-2 (26) . Furthermore, hTERT (human telomerase reverse transcriptase) THF cells also did not support virus replication (Figure 3) .\nPrevious studies have shown that human immune cells, such as THP-1 cells, are susceptible to SARS-CoV infection (25) . In our study, human immune cell populations, including THP-1-derived cell lines and primary cells (PBMCs) did not support productive SARS-CoV-2 replication (Figure 3 ). Although primary CD4+ T cells did not support productive virus replication, we observed virus-like particles in these cells by electron microscopy ( Figure 4 , panel C). We also detected SARS-CoV-2 proteins in infected CD4+ T cells by using fluorescent microscopy ( Figure 1, panels B, C) . This finding is consistent with that recently reported by Wang et al. when they demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 and pseudotyped viruses could enter human T-cell lines (MT-2) (32). Those authors also noted that SARS-CoV-2 replication was abortive in MT-2 cells. SARS-CoV-2 transcript levels in infected MT-2 cells increased at 6 h after infection but remained steady at later time points, indicating a lack of virus replication in these cells (32) . This finding is similar to abortive replication observed in MERS-CoV-infected T lymphocytes (33) . However, the study by Wang et al. did not quantify virus titers in the supernatant from infected cells. In our study, we could not detect any replication-competent virus in the supernatant that was collected from SARS-CoV-2-infected CD4+ T cells (Figure 3 ). Human immune cells lack expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (34) (https://www.proteinatlas.org), the functional receptor of SARS-CoV-2 (1, 35) . Emerging data indicate that there could be other receptors, such as CD147, that may facilitate cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 (K. Wang et al., unpub. data, https://www. biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.14.988345v1). Additional studies are needed to determine the full breadth of cellular receptors and coreceptors that may facilitate entry of SARS-CoV-2. Thus, although it is intriguing that CD4+ T cells may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, our data show that these cells are not permissive to SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro. More studies are required to fully identify the effects of SARS-CoV-2 entry in CD4+ T lymphocytes.\nIn conclusion, we report that although a human lung cell line supported replication of SARS-CoV-2, the virus did not propagate in any of the tested immune cell lines or primary human immune cells. Although we did not observe a productive infection in CD4+ primary T lymphocytes, we observed virus-like particles in these cells by electron microscopy. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 can enter CD4+ primary T lymphocytes but is unable to replicate efficiently. Our data shed light on a wider range of human cells that may or may not be permissive for SARS-CoV-2 replication, and our study strongly suggests that the human immune cells tested do not support a productive infection with SARS-CoV-2."}]
