INTRODUCTION The National Agricultural Statistics Service's (NASS) primary purpose is to provide timely, accurate and useful statistics on United States and Puerto Rico agriculture. NASS conducts hundreds of surveys for the purpose of making estimates on crops, livestock, production practices, farm economics, etc. The Wheat Objective Yield Survey is the third survey to use ___________________ 1 / Michael W. Gerling  handheld Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers for data collection. In 2004 GPS handheld receivers were successfully used for Washington Field Office's Agricultural Resource Management Survey Phase II (ARMS II) and in 2005 were marginally successful for the June Area Survey."}, {"section_title": "WHEAT OBJECTIVE YIELD SURVEY", "text": "The Wheat Objective Yield Survey (WOY) is conducted annually in twelve states and provides information used to forecast the amount of wheat harvested per acre as well the amount of wheat unable to be harvested. Ultimately, the data provide an estimate for the production of wheat at the state, regional, and national levels. To obtain these data, field enumerators physically go to sampled wheat fields, lay out two objective yield units and record various crop counts. Field enumerators return to the same locations every month and record various crop counts until the fields are harvested. On the initial visit to the field, the enumerator ties red flagging ribbon at the point of entry into the field and around the outer-most plants of the rows where the units are located. The ribbon aid the enumerator in returning to the designated area the following month. At the end of each month from April through August, the enumerator returns to the same units and records the various crop counts. A wheat field may have up to four samples within it. Each sample consists of two units located within the field. Each unit is composed of an area which is approximately six feet in length and three crop rows wide."}, {"section_title": "WHAT IS A GPS HANDHELD RECEIVER?", "text": "The Global Positioning System is comprised of at least twenty-four satellites orbiting the earth. These satellites transmit signals to GPS receivers on the ground. The majority of GPS receivers are about the size of a standard television remote control. A GPS receiver only receives signals from the satellites. It does not transmit. To function properly, a GPS receiver requires an unobstructed view of the sky. First, the GPS receiver acquires signals from these various satellites. Next, the GPS receiver determines the location of the satellites from the information included in the satellites' transmissions. The receiver then calculates the distance it is from each satellite. Finally, the receiver is able to determine where it is actually located on the Earth within a certain degree of accuracy. The receiver will display its location in latitude and longitude coordinates. Latitude measures the distance north or south from the Equator while longitude measures the distance east and west from the Prime Meridian. A common use of GPS receivers is for hiking. Hikers utilize these receivers to trace their trail or to mark a unique location that they would like to return to at a later date. The particular GPS receiver used in this study was the Garmin GPS-72. See Figure 1. The GPS receivers are the same receivers purchased and used for the ARMS II research project conducted in the fall of 2004. At that time Garmin was selected because the company was a respected manufacturer of GPS receivers for fifteen years. The GPS-72 model was also among the lowest-price GPS receivers ($150) offering Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS). WAAS provides the potential to obtain a level of accuracy of ten feet. Typically, the GPS-72 receiver will provide a level of accuracy between 10 and 50 feet. "}, {"section_title": "THE RESEARCH PROJECT", "text": "Washington's 2005 WOY sample consisted of 160 winter wheat fields. In previous WOY data collections, field enumerators would sometimes have a difficult time locating their marked samples from their last visit. The reasons vary from the identifiable ribbon blowing away in the wind, to the enumerator being at the completely wrong field. In a few cases, the ribbon is accidentally cut when agricultural workers mow the grass along the edge of the field. At this point, the enumerator then has to go to the field=s starting corner and count off the same number of rows and paces into the field, as on the initial visit, and hopefully, find the sample units. However, there are times that a sample unit cannot be found, at which point the enumerator has to lay out the unit again, wasting valuable time and resources. This also breaks the data series that was being created for that particular field and thus the quality of the data suffers. Hence, the Washington Field Office (WA FO) supplied their field enumerators with GPS receivers to assist in locating the sampled wheat fields' units. The expectation was that equipping enumerators with low-cost handheld GPS receivers, the field enumerators would save time in those instances when they have difficulty finding a unit or are unable to locate a unit and have to lay out a replacement unit."}, {"section_title": "ENUMERATOR TRAINING", "text": "Each year a Wheat Objective Yield Survey Workshop is conducted to review the details of the survey and data collection procedures. Educating all 23 field enumerators on how to use their GPS receivers was incorporated into the workshop for the 2005 survey. For the entire sample, Washington field enumerators were instructed to do the following: During the initial visit, use the GPS receivers to determine the latitude and longitude coordinates of both units. Record these coordinates on the outside of the manila kit envelope (one envelope per sample was provided) and on the completed Part B Form which is completed at the initial visit. Mail the completed Part B Forms to the office. Thus the WA FO could verify that the latitude and longitude coordinates were indeed obtained. This was also beneficial if a different field enumerator or office staff needed to visit the field and record counts. During subsequent visits, if the field enumerator was having difficulty finding the sample units, he/she would review the coordinates on the kit envelope and use the GPS receiver to guide him/her to the unit of interest. However, since the Garmin GPS-72 receiver's level of accuracy is between 10 and 50 feet, the field enumerator would still have to look around for the sample unit. Finally, the field enumerators were to complete the Enumerator Feedback Form (similar to a diary) and record any problems in using the GPS receivers in determining the latitude and longitude coordinates on their initial visit. Also, the enumerators were to record any problems in finding the previously laid out units and whether the GPS receiver was helpful or not. Appendix A provides a copy of the Enumerator Feedback Form. The GPS receiver training required only 15 minutes since all but two field enumerators had used the receivers before. See Appendix B for a copy of the field enumerator instructions on how to use the GPS handheld receiver for the Wheat Objective Yield Survey."}, {"section_title": "FIELD EXPERIENCE", "text": "The author of this report was provided with an opportunity to work with two field enumerators on the WOY. The following excerpts are from notes made following those field trips. \"On the first day, after reaching the sampled field, the weather turned for the worse and it started raining. The sample unit was easy to find by noting the red ribbon and poles. The previously recorded coordinates of the unit matched those of my GPS receiver. The rain made it impossible to record the counts onto the paper form since the paper was turning to mush. However, I also brought a Trimble Geo-XT GPS receiver. This particular receiver is designed to handle harsh environments and contains a built in personal digital assistant (mini-personal computer). Hence, I was able to use Microsoft Word and input the counts into a blank Word document using the stylus. A stylus is a pen-like writing instrument used for data entry and screen navigation. Once back inside the vehicle, I brought up the Word document and the field enumerator recorded the counts onto the paper form. This was great for the field enumerator, since the enumerator didn't have to remember the counts which could lead to errors. The enumerator asked when we would be issuing these Trimble GPS receivers. However, with a list price of $4,500 to $5,000 per receiver, the cost is impractical for WOY. The unit's high price is due to having a built in personal digital assistant, provides a level of accuracy of within 3 feet and is durable to withstand harsh weather conditions. On the second day, I met a different field enumerator and I followed by vehicle to the sampled field. Upon reaching the supposed sampled field, we started looking for the red ribbon to mark the entry path to the unit. We couldn't find the ribbon so we picked a reasonable point and walked in to where the enumerator thought the unit was. After 20 minutes or more of wandering around we decided to use the GPS receiver and realized that we were several hundred feet off. We got back into our vehicles and drove until the GPS receiver's numbers roughly matched the coordinates recorded from the initial visit. Immediately the field enumerator saw the red ribbon and the poles marking the unit. The data were then successfully collected.\" Hence, the author was provided with first hand experiences on how handheld GPS receivers can help in field data collection."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": "Despite being a requirement, only 107 of the 160 Enumerator Feedback Forms were returned. The following findings/numbers are based on these 107 feedback forms. On the initial visit to the field, one enumerator complained about the batteries dying on them in the field and another stated that it took thirty minutes to get a reading due to cloud cover. On the follow-up visits, there were four times that the GPS receivers helped in locating a unit. The other data collection times, the field enumerators had no trouble finding their units. Although this number of uses is low, it was not unexpected. Examining the years 2000 through 2004, the number of times that a Washington WOY unit had to be laid out again averaged 8 times. However, for 2005 there was only one unit that could not be located on a subsequent visit and had to be laid out again. This was due to the agricultural operator harvesting the field before the enumerator was able to take final counts. According to the WA FO, this mishap is highly unusual. Typically, the agricultural operator notifies the enumerator a few days before harvesting the field. Determining why units had to be laid out again in other years, was not possible since the questionnaires were shredded. Of course, there is always the possibility that 2005 was a fluke. Hence, a review of the past six years indicated that the year with the fewest number of times that a unit had to be laid out again was the year when GPS receivers were used. See Table 1. Finally, field enumerators did report wanting to learn how to set \"waypoints\" with the GPS receiver. A waypoint is a stored latitude/longitude coordinate in the receiver. Theoretically, the enumerators could have recorded the sampled units' coordinates in the device and then during a return visit the receiver would have displayed the direction to and the distance from the unit. However, to keep the level of instruction simple, the WA FO had decided to only instruct the enumerators on the basics and perhaps next year introduce more advanced features as they become more familiar with using the receivers."}, {"section_title": "COST -BENEFIT ANALYSIS", "text": "A cost-benefit analysis was conducted to determine if using GPS receivers for the Wheat Objective Yield Survey is practical and cost efficient. The cost breakdown is as follows. The Garmin GPS-72 receivers were already purchased for the ARMS Phase II. Hence, no additional costs for the receivers were incurred. Had this not been the case, 23 handheld GPS receivers, at $150 a piece, would have cost $3,450. Miscellaneous expenditures were estimated at $50. This includes the purchase of spare AA batteries (2 extra batteries per enumerator), paper to print the GPS instructions on, etc. The GPS training of the twenty-three enumerators was expensed at $68, including salary and benefits. Costs of the hotel rooms and conference room were excluded since the GPS training was incorporated into the regularly held WOY workshop. As far as WA FO staff expenses, a statistician spent one hour total in preparing training materials and in training the field enumerators. Hence, the total expenditures for the research project were $118 and 1 hour of a WA FO statistician's time. See Table 2. 2/ All enumerator costs were based on each enumerator's actual time and salaries. The average salary of the enumerators was $9.80 per hour. The average salary and benefits of the enumerators (using NASS' formula of (salary*1.0763)*1.11) calculates to $11.71 per hour. 3/ Staff salaries and associated benefits expenses were absorbed by the field office. On the benefits side, the GPS handheld receivers did help the field enumerators locate four units in subsequent field visits. Although the field enumerators may have found these units without the GPS receivers, their use did save the enumerators an immeasurable amount of time and ensured that the time series of the data was not compromised by having to lay out a replacement unit. Also, the enumerators were using the receivers for the June Area Survey, showing that the receivers can be used for multiple surveys at the same time. Finally, usage of the GPS receivers appeared to almost eliminate units having to be laid out more than once."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "As field offices start acquiring GPS receivers for data collection activities, then using GPS receivers for the Wheat Objective Yield Survey will be practical since the additional cost will be minimal. Also, as the enumerators' GPS skill level increases, they will be able to enter and locate waypoints which should increase the usefulness of the receivers. To date, NASS has successfully tested three ways to use GPS receivers for data collection: for the Agricultural Resources Management Survey -Phase II, for the June Area Survey and now for the Wheat Objective Yield Survey.

Field enumerators return to the same locations every month until the fields are harvested, and record various crop counts.
