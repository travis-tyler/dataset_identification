[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Mathematics is also called as the servant and queen of science, mathematics is also a body of knowledge essential for the achievement of a scientific/technological nation 1. Students' mathematics achievement is assosiated with the success of the government, schools, parents and teachers. Various efforts made to can improve mathematics achievement in the countries. Based on Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2011 report, mathematics achievement for Indonesia student's lowest than other ASEAN countries such as Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore and other countries in the world. Based on the problem, we used TIMSS data for Indonesia student's to found whether there are correlation between students attitude, selfbelief, students engagement in mathematics lessons with mathematics achievement. Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) is a multivariate statistical procedure that is used to study the relationships between a set of latent variables and a set observed variables. The use of CFA could be impacted by the research hypothesis being testing and the requirement of sufficient sample size. In the study will be analyzed the correlations among latent variables (students attitude, self-belief, students engagement in mathematics lessons and mathematics achievement) and observed variables. Michelli 2 found that there was a positive relationship between mathematics attitude and achievement, the data analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Science (SPSS) software and was conducted statistical analysis, a Pearson correlation to examine relationship significantly between attitude and mathematics achievement. Rahmatina 3 has also conducted through a regression linear was used to determine whether there are effect between student attitude toward mathematics and their mathematics achievement, the data analyzed using SPSS and Lisrel software and had summarized that a strong positive relationship between student attitude toward mathematics and their mathematics achievement. Several researcher was used Structural Equation Modeling to provide information for assessing the effect, correlation of learning and teaching strategies4 by evaluated relations among attitudes, initial skill, and performance in a Quantitative Methods course that involved students in active learning using a structural modeling approach. Similar with other studies5 has been observed that established model has acceptable fit indices and an increasing number of teachers and expert teachers have positive effects on students' science and mathematics achievements. And also used by 6, they are included the Confirmatory Factor Analysis to compared of self belief for predicting student motivation and achievement. In this study, we tried to address using CFA in students attitude, self-belief, students engagement in mathematics lessons and mathematics achievement and examined the correlation between its variables."}, {"section_title": "Literature Review", "text": "Attitudes toward mathematics can be defined as a concept of how an individual to think, act, and behave. Student's success in mathematics depends upon attitude towards mathematics, factors that affect student success in learning comes from internal and external factors. Students' attitudes toward mathematics is one of the internal factors that affect mathematics achievement. Kulm 7 suggests that it is probably not possible to offer a definition of attitude toward mathematics that would be suitable for all situations, and even if one were agreed on, it would probably be too general to be useful. Self belief in mathematics can be defined as the individual's personal judgement in relation to his/her abilities in mathematical process. According to Richardson 8,beliefs are \"psychologically held understandings, premises, or propositions about the world that are felt to be true\" and Raymond 9 defined mathematics beliefs as personal judgments about mathematics formulated from experiences in mathematics, including beliefs about the nature of mathematics, learning mathematics, and teaching mathematics. During the last twenty years the research area about self beliefs and mathematics achievement, and many different countries have been included in the research, for example Rao et al., 10, in Dan-iel11 noted that self concept of mathematics ability was a significant predictor of subsequent achievement. The meta analysis can be used to finding of the relation of self belief to academic achievement, and found that there are relations between measures of self belief and later achievement, controlling for prior achieve-ment12. Engagement is a construct used to describe an inner quality of concentration and effort to learn, student engagement in academic work as the student's psychological investment in and effort directed toward learning, understanding, or mastering the knowledge, skills, or crafts that academic work is intended to promote 13. Linnenbrink and Pintrich 14 divided student engagement into three types, the first is \"behavioral engagement\", which involves observable behavior, the second type of engagement is \"cognitive Engagement \" which associated with better learning and levels of achievemenet and the third type of engagement is \"motivational engagement\" , there are three aspects of motivational engagement are personal interest, utility value and affect or emotional experiences. Warwick,15 found that ways to reduce anxiety and enhance self-efficacy and engagement can significantly improve student performance in mathematics and, as such, can be a powerful complementary approach to mathematics support. Students attitude toward mathematics contains three observed variables : 1) Students like learning mathematics,2) Students value mathematics, and 3) Student confidence with mathematics. Students like learning mathematics scale addressed to measure students' interest and liking of learning mathematics. Students value mathematics scale addresses students' attitudes about the importance of the subject and usefulness of the subject, sometimes called attainment value and utility value 23 and the student confidence with mathematics scale assesses students' self-confidence or self-concept in their ability to learn mathematics. To assess mathematics assessment is based on a comprehensive framework developed collaboratively with the participant countries, the way to measure student's mathematics achievement on that scale in the TIMSS 2011 had five plausible variables which explained mathematics achievement, there are labelled BSMMAT01 through BSMMAT05.There are four content domains, numbers, algebra, geometry, data and chance, whereas knowing, applying and reasoning were assessed in the cognitive domain can be seen in Table  1 by TIMSS 2011   "}, {"section_title": "Methodology/Materials", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Results and Finding", "text": "The analysis is conducted through a correlation used determine whether there are correlated among latent variables students attitude, self-belief , students engagement,mathematics achievement and observed variables. The student questionnaire seeks information about students attitude toward mathematics can be seen that 2,3% only student confident with mathematics, this percentage was lower for like learning mathematics and value mathematics,18,3% and 30,2 % respectively (see Table 3). In table 4 shown that the percentage of students self belief about mathematics for important to do well in math has highest percentage (40%) of the point scale agree a lot, and only small percentages of students ( 1%) disagree a lot, the majority of students ( 82,4%) of the point scale agree to like mathematics, and the majority of students (79,1%) disagree math is boring    In table 5 shown that the percentage of students engagements in mathematics lessons, most students agree teacher expects to do ( 92,6%) and disagree (7,4 % ), smaller percentages of students agree (23,7%) for interested in what teacher says,the majority of students ( 88,1%) of the point scale agree that teacher is easy to understand. In table 6 shown that descriptive statistics for mathematics achievement variable, the mean for mathematics achievement about 400 and standard deviation is 83.      Table 7 shows the correlations between the latent variables gives the results of all latent variables. These correlations are in the expected direction and all are significant at an alpha level of 0.05 (t value > 1.96). And in figure 4 shows the correlation among latent variables and observed variables and all are significant (t value > 1.96), all variables are positive correlation between latent variables and observed variable expect for BSBM14B with latent variable BELIEF (t value = -41.43), BSBM14C with BELIEF (t value = -56.82) and BSBM15C with latent variable ENGAGE-MENT (t value = -17.69) It's mean that BSBM14B and BSBM14C increases, the BELIEF in mathematics decreases. As well as the correlation between BSBM15C and ENGAGEMENT, the BSBM15C increase, the ENGAGEMENT decrease and otherwise."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "In this study we have used CFA to examine the effect of students attitude toward mathematics, students self-belief and students engagement in mathematics lesson for mathematics achievement. Data analysis indicated that a strong negative relationship between latent variables, there are student attitude toward mathematics, self-belief in mathematics with their mathematics achievement and a strong positive relationship between student's engagement in mathematics lesson with mathematics achievement. Relationship between latent variable with observed variables are positive correlation except relationship wish have not to study mathematics and math is boring with self-belief about mathematics and relationship teacher is easy to understand and students engagement in mathematics lessons. This study points to future research, our focus here used how important Confirmatory Factor Analysis to analysis related laten variables and observed variables, other analysis is needed such as structural equation modeling is used to the combination of factor analysis and multiple regression analysis."}]
