A variety of changes in mitochondria have been described in aging skeletal muscle, including a reduction of number, morphological changes, reduced oxidative phosphorylation efficiency that impairs ATP production, and excess release of reactive oxygen species that cause oxidative damage and possibly accumulation of mitochondrial DNA mutations (Gonzalez-Freire et al., 2015; Kent & Fitzgerald, 2016) . The decline of skeletal muscle mitochondrial oxidative capacity has been associated with lower gait speed, especially in task that require endurance (Choi et al., 2016) . Higher physical activity has been associated with higher mitochondrial mass and function (Kent & Fitzgerald, 2016) . Insulin resistance is associated with lower mitochondrial function, although the direction of this association is still a matter of discussion (Fabbri et al., 2017) .\nRecent epidemiological studies show that low concentrations of circulating species in the lipid class of lysophosphatidylcholines (LPC) are independent predictors of several aging phenotypes. Low plasma LPC 18:2 predicted memory impairment and/or Alzheimer's disease in a case-control study (Mapstone et al., 2014) . Low serum LPC 17:0 and 18:2 predicted incident myocardial infarction in populationbased studies (Ward-Caviness et al., 2017) . In community-dwelling adults \u226550 years, low plasma 18:2 predicted greater decline of gait speed (Gonzalez-Freire et al., 2015) . LPC are biologically active lipids that comprise a major class of lipids in human plasma. LPC can serve as ligands for specific G protein-coupled signaling receptors and as a precursor to lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). LPA is an intermediate in the biosynthetic pathway of cardiolipin, an important dimeric phospholipid that is found almost exclusively in the inner mitochondrial membrane (Schlame & Greenberg, 2017) . LPA also has specific receptors involved in growth and differentiation (Aikawa, Hashimoto, Kano, & Aoki, 2015) .\nWe hypothesized that lower plasma LPC were associated with lower mitochondrial oxidative capacity. To address this hypothesis, we measured plasma LPC in a sample of adults who had muscle bioenergetics assessed using phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( 31 P-MRS) for quantifying postexercise recovery rate of phosphocreatine (PCr), k PCr , a measure of mitochondrial oxidative capacity."}, {"section_title": "| RESULTS", "text": "The characteristics of the study population by quartile of mitochondrial oxidative capacity (k Pcr ) are shown in Multiple machine-learning classification algorithms were combined using the SuperLearner algorithm, described in Methods, to assess the ability of the six LPC (16:0, 16:1, 17:0, 18:1, 18:2, 20:3) associated with k PCr to classify those in the highest quartile of k PCr (Semba et al., 2016; van der Laan, Polley, & Hubbard, 2007 "}, {"section_title": "| DISCUSSION", "text": "The present study shows that higher plasma LPC with fatty acid chains 16:0 (palmitic acid), 16:1 (palmitoleic acid), 17:0 (margaric acid), 18:1 (oleic acid), 18:2 (linoleic acid), and 20:3 (eicosatrienoic acid, n-3, dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid, n-6, and/or mead acid, n-9) are associated with higher mitochondrial oxidative capacity in adults.\nThe major species of 20:3 and 20:4 are in the n-6 configuration in plasma. To our knowledge, this is the first study to identify circulating biomarkers associated with mitochondrial oxidative capacity in skeletal muscle in humans. | 3 of 8 A potential biological mechanism by which LPC could influence mitochondrial oxidative capacity is through its role in the synthesis pathway of cardiolipin. Cardiolipin is a unique dimeric phospholipid containing four fatty acid chains that is specific to mitochondria.\nCardiolipin is an essential constituent of mitochondrial membranes (Schlame & Greenberg, 2017) . LPC in human plasma can be generated by the activity of: (a) phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2 ) on phosphatidylcholine; (b) by the activity of endothelial lipase (EL), including phospholipase A 1 (PLA 1 ), on high-density lipoprotein (Gauster et al., 2005) ; (c) from phosphatidylcholine during the formation of cholesteryl esters (Figure 3 ). The synthesis of cardiolipin involves LPA and phosphatidic acid (PA). LPC can be hydrolyzed to LPA by autotaxin, a secreted glycoprotein that is widely expressed in tissues (Lyu et al., 2017; Perrakis & Moolenaar, 2014) (Figure 3 ).\nThe membranes of both mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum contain LPC (Pollard, Ortori, St\u00f6ger, Barrett, & Chakrabarti, 2017; Tsalouhidou et al., 2006; Veyrat-Durebex et al., 2018) . LPA can also be formed from the acylation of glycerol-3-phosphate on the outer mitochondrial membrane. Two isoforms of acylglycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (AGPAT 4 and 5) are located on the outer mitochondrial membrane and catalyze the acylation of LPA to PA (Gonzalez- Baro & Coleman, 2017) . PA is transferred to the inner mitochondrial membrane and is converted to nascent cardiolipin via CDP-glycerol, phosphatidylglycerophosphate, and phosphatidylglycerol ( Figure 3 ). Nascent cardiolipin contains four fatty acid chains but then undergoes structural remodeling in which cardiolipin acquires a new set of fatty acids. The remodeling of cardiolipin is catalyzed by tafazzin, an enzyme that transfers fatty acids between phospholipids and lysophospholipids (Schlame & Greenberg, 2017) . The dominant cardiolipin, comprising~80%-90% of cardiolipin in mitochondria from normal human skeletal muscle in Westerners, is tetralinoleoyl cardiolipin (18:2) 4 (Ikon & Ryan, 2017) . Tafazzin does not show substrate preference and is not specific for linoleoyl chains; thus, the concept has emerged that fatty acid availability influences the final form of cardiolipin that is incorporated into mitochondrial inner membranes (Ikon & Ryan, 2017) . The fatty acid species composition of cardiolipin may be critical. Cardiolipin influences membrane biophysical properties and shapes the curvature of the mitochondrial cristae, which affects the assembly and function of the electron transport chain complexes and generation of ATP (Paradies, Paradies, Benedictis, Ruggiero, & Petrosillo, 2014; Pennington et al., 2017) .\nDietary intake of lipids can influence the fatty acid species composition of cardiolipin and mitochondrial bioenergetics (Monteiro, Oliveria et al., 2013a; Monteiro, Pereira et al., 2013) . Significant differences in major species of cardiolipin and mitochondrial bioenergetics were found in an experimental rat model following feeding with a rapeseed oil-based diet (Monteiro, Oliveria et al., 2013a; Monteiro, Pereira et al., 2013) . Moreover, a DHA-rich diet led to a high content of the tetra-docosahexanoyl cardiolipin (22:6 4 ) (Hussein et al., 2009 ). Higher dietary intake of linoleate (18:2) increased the incorporation of 18:2 in the fatty acid profile of cardiolipin in heart and brain mitochondria in rats (McGee, Lieberman, & Greenwood, 1996) . Low plasma concentrations of certain LPC species, such as 18:1 and 18:2, could potentially impact the final fatty acid composition of cardiolipin. In humans, plasma LPC 18:2 concentrations generally decrease with age (Trabado et al., 2017) .\nMultiple machine-learning algorithms with cross-validated estimates showed that the six LPC species classified individuals in the highest quartile of k PCr compared to those in the lower three F I G U R E 2 Cross-validated receiver operating curves of the relationship of the 6 significant plasma LPC species with the highest quartile of k PCr using Super Learner, cross-validated (CV) Super Learner, and eight machine-learning algorithms.

In previous studies involving k PCr in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, height was included as a covariate in multivariable analyses (Choi et al., 2016; Fabbri et al., 2017) . In the present study, multivariable analyses showed that the relationship of LPC with k PCr was more significant when height was included as a covariate. Further studies are needed to understand how anthropometric measures could influence the relationship of LPC with mitochondrial oxidative capacity.\nThe strengths of this study are the sample of well-characterized community-dwelling adults with a relatively low burden of disease, standardized collection of fasting plasma samples, mitochondrial oxidative capacity, and measurement of LPC using LC-MS/MS. The limitations of this study include that the findings from this study cannot necessarily be generalized to other study populations. The BLSA is a convenience sample of adults, not a population-based study. BLSA participants tend to be healthier, more educated, and have higher socioeconomic status than the general population. The BLSA may be unique in the collection of a large amount of data on skeletal muscle mitochondrial oxidative capacity in an ongoing cohort study of aging. Replication of the findings of the present study in another ongoing cohort is possible but would require substantial resources and time.\nFuture work is needed to characterize the relationship of low circulating LPC with decline of skeletal muscle oxidative capacity over time and to examine the relationship of circulating LPC with the fatty acid composition of cardiolipin in skeletal muscle."}, {"section_title": "| EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "| Study subjects", "text": "The study subjects consisted of 385 participants, aged 25-97 years, procedures, and related risk were explained to participants, they consented to participate in the study and signed an informed consent document."}, {"section_title": "| Mitochondrial oxidative capacity measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy in vivo", "text": "Measurements of 31 P-MRS of phosphorus-containing metabolites were obtained from the vastus lateralis muscle of the left thigh using a 3T Philips Achieva MRI scanner (Philips, Best, The Netherlands) and a 10-cm 31 P-tuned flat surface coil (PulseTeq, Surrey, UK).

Multivariable linear regression models were used to examine the relationship between plasma lysophosphatidylcholines and the highest quartile versus the bottom three quartiles of k PCr . Classification modeling with eight machine-learning algorithms was used to examine the ability of the six LPC to classify the highest quartile of mitochondrial oxidative capacity from the lower three quartiles. SuperLearner is an ensembling approach to machine learning is based upon the idea that no single machine-learning algorithm is optimal for all data sets (van der Laan et al., 2007) . The SuperLearner algorithm was used to fit, internally cross-validate, and combine the results into a single classifier, as described in detail elsewhere; Semba et al., 2016) . First, multiple individual machine-learning classification algorithms (e.g., logistic regression) were implemented, using only a portion of the data to train each algorithm. Second, we combined estimates using the data left out of the training data, producing a cross-validated estimate. The cross-validated results from the individual machinelearning algorithms were then combined via weighted average to minimize a cross-validated mean squared error. The weighted average potentially fits the data better than each individual algorithm.\nCross-validated SuperLearner additionally leaves out a portion of data in the second step to produce cross-validated estimates of the weights. SuperLearner tests multiple machine-learning algorithms and optimally combines the results to find the lowest mean squared error (Polley & van der Laan, 2015; Rose, 2013) . SuperLearner was applied by splitting the data into ten mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive groups.\nWe selected eight individual machine-learning algorithms to protect against model misspecification: (a) glmnet() in the glmnet package with alpha = 1 (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator\n[LASSO] regularization) (Friedman, Hastie, & Tibshirani, 2010) , (b) glmnet() with alpha = 0 (ridge regression regularization) (Friedman et al., 2010) , (c) glmnet() with alpha = 0.5 (elastic net regularization, which is a hybrid of LASSO and ridge regression regularization) (Friedman et al., 2010) , (d) gbm() in the gbm package (generalized boosted regression) (Friedman, 2001; Friedman et al., 2010) with 10,000 trees and interaction depth = 2, (e) randomForest() in the randomForest package (random forest ensemble of classification and regression trees) with 1,000 trees (Breiman, 2001 ), (f) ipredbagg() in the ipred() package (bootstrap aggregation [BAGGing] of classification and regression trees) (Breiman, 2001 ) with 100 replicates, (g) earth() in the earth package (Milborrow, 2015) (an implementation of adaptive regression using piecewise linear splines) (Friedman 1991) , and (h) bayesglm() in the arm package (main effects Bayesian logistic regression) with a Cauchy prior with scale = 2.5. Three algorithms had positive weights and contributed to the final classifier: ridge regression (Friedman et al., 2010) , random forests (Breiman, 2001) , and Bayes generalized linear models.
