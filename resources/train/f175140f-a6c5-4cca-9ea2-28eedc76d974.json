[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "In this paper, I briefly explore the history, foundations, and challenges of doctoral education in the United States. With an overview of learning theory on which these programs can be based, subsequent sections of this paper discuss ways curriculum developers are working to create and nurture a doctoral cohort, including examples of program delivery strategies and a wide variety of types of appropriate, useful final projects. Rigor and relevancy helps ensure that these credentials are widely accepted by the general public as appropriate terminal degrees. Such a discussion is constructive as students are eager to earn the doctoral credential and educators are often very interested in meeting this new demand. It is clear that universities with curricula that are personal, flexible, and relevant are in the best position to prepare expert practitioners who can address issues of practice and policy in the field. Faculty in these doctoral programs are experimenting with a variety of student-centered learning approaches that address the need for the development of new knowledge based on the experiences of the learner and the realities of the workplace. Unfortunately, many of us in education are still in the throes of differentiating our PhD programs from our professional doctoral programs, but the conversation is moving forward."}, {"section_title": "The consummate professional", "text": "In the United States, the professional doctorate professes to credential high-functioning individuals for areas where high level of expertise and (often) leadership abilities are assumed. The professional practice doctorate in law and medicine has a rich history here as the first JD (Doctor of Jurisprudence) was awarded by the College of William and Mary in 1793, and the first MD (Doctor of Medicine) in 1807. These degrees were awarded decades before the first PhD (Doctor of Philosophy) in 1861 (Willis et al., 2010). The JD and MD degrees were designed to raise the bar as to the qualifications needed to enter law or medicine; previously, anyone could put up his/her 'shingle' as a medical practitioner or as an advocate. It simply isn't possible to practice medicine or law without an extremely high knowledge base to begin with; but before the degree holder is considered ready to practice on his/her own, he or she must go through years of internship or apprenticeship in the workplace after the degree is earned as well as pass rigorous state licensing exams. While a doctoral degree and licensing is required for entry level medical doctors and lawyers, some bachelors and masters programs in certain applied fields are considered to be entry-level qualifications. To be a teacher in New York City, for example, the holder of a bachelor's degree from an approved institution would need to be certified by his or her university. The university must be certified by the state. And the prospective teacher would then have to pass a separate city licensing examination. Likewise, an individual with a bachelor's degree in nursing, once licensed, can practice nursing at an entry level. An example of a master's degree that is considered a first professional degree and terminal degree at the same time is the Masters of Fine Arts (MFA), a practice degree that requires applicants to provide a portfolio of work or a performance audition. On the other hand, professional research doctorates such as the EdD and the DBA (Doctor of Business Administration) are generally not under the auspices of accrediting boards and there are no state examinations. Those studying for such degrees arrive with years of work experience before a rigorous investigation of practice and policies. Thus, the role of these programs is to provide experienced practitioners with opportunities to expand their knowledge base by developing and applying analytical skills and ethical understandings to workplace practices and policies (Bollag, 2007)."}, {"section_title": "Degree completion data", "text": "Data are inconclusive as to the exact number of professional doctorates awarded in the United States each year as the two main organizations that collect such data, the National Council for Educational Statistics (NCES) and the National Science Foundation (NSF), use different methods of data collection and reporting and thus provide different statistics. However, they both distinguish first professional doctoral degrees from research doctorates. In the introduction to their tables, NCES (2010) defines research doctorates as \u2026oriented toward preparing students to make original intellectual contributions in a field of study. Doctorates require the completion of a dissertation or equivalent project and are not primarily intended for the practice of a profession (NCES: first paragraph). In this 'Digest of Educational Statistics', NCES provides data from surveys sent to degreegranting institutions that participate in Title IV federal financing programs. Their reports include numbers of research doctorates completed as well as first professional doctorates. In 2007-2008, a total of 63,712 research doctorates were awarded; and for 2018-2019, they estimated that number to grow to 91,209. The overall number of first professional doctorates increased from 63,953 in 197663,953 in -197763,953 in to 91,309 in 200763,953 in -2008. Table 1 provides data from their 2007-2008 survey, showing the number of doctoral degrees awarded in selected fields and their growth percentages. These data describe research doctorates and do not include first professional degrees. Note that 'health professions and related clinical' are the fastest growing fields, up 127% from [2004][2005][2006][2007][2008]. What is unclear from this data set is the number of non-PhD degrees awarded in these fields.  Table 273. April, 2010 http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d09/tables/dt09_273.asp accessed October 10, 2010. On the other hand, the NSF 'Survey of Earned Doctorates' which is sponsored by six different federal agencies, provides data from individual degree recipients. NSF sends surveys to institutional coordinators in graduate schools who distribute the survey to those receiving research doctorates. The coordinators collect the forms, and then return them to the survey contractor. They then compile data on descriptive variables such as recipients' sex, age, citizenship, race/ethnicity, country of citizenship, field of study, and even include data related to their debt level, time to doctorate, and postgraduate position/location. Their tables also show the number of research doctoral degrees awarded in specific fields and growth percentages. The specific doctorates included in the \"Survey of Earned Doctorates\" include the EdD (Doctor of Education), the DBA (Doctor of Business Administration), the DMA (Doctor of Musical Arts) , the DPH (Doctor of Public Health), and the DNSC (Doctor of Nursing Science).  (Golde, 2006). They investigated admissions and management issues including underrepresented minorities, high attrition rates, and long completion times. They also examined the expanding boundaries of disciplines and learning outcomes that don't always match the careers to which students aspire. In doing this, the CID asked sixteen highly regarded scholars to respond in essays to the questions: 1. What constitutes knowledge and understanding in the discipline? 2. What is the nature of stewardship of the discipline? 3. How ought PhD's be prepared? These essays were compiled into a book: Envisioning the Future of Doctoral Education: The knowledge level and work experiences of the student are differentiating factors between entrants for first professional doctorates and professional research doctorates. Sometimes these distinctions are characterized as differences between declarative (knowing that), procedural (knowing how), and strategic (knowing when) knowledge (Gott, 1999). Combined with characterization of the stages of skill development: novice, advanced beginner, competent, proficient, expert (Dreyfus, 1982), the challenge of developing professional doctorate programs can be articulated: to help competent/proficient learners develop strategic skills and apply those skills at an expert level. Concepts that are useful in creating programs that use the knowledge of practice as a basis for generating new knowledge are communities of learning and expansionist learning. Etienne Wenger, building on social learning concepts, describes learning as social participation, and suggests that learners-whether they are in the workplace or an academic environment, can work together to solve problems and create new knowledge. Yujo Engestrom (2011) goes a step further in suggesting that learning is more than acquisition of knowledge or participation in learning communities. His expansionist model, whereby the instructor, the student, and those in workplace, work to develop new knowledge, implies that questions are being posed and investigated to which no one knows the answer. The challenge for educators then becomes how to create a learning environment that moves us from considering that learning is an individual activity that is a result of teaching to an understanding that learning is a result of environments that tap the joint expertise of the learners, their faculty, and others in their workplace. This view has implications for providing a foundation for academic curricula and classroom learning environments that are social, interactive in nature, and use learner experiences, which have been described as 'the resource of highest value in adult education \u2026.*becoming+ the adult learner's living textbook' (Lindeman in Mirriam et al., 2007: 161). An expansionist model is a very useful foundation for designing and delivering professional doctorate programs."}, {"section_title": "Examples of best practices", "text": "To keep professional programs from being 'PhD-lite', and to ensure that they tap and develop the expertise of the learners, significant thought needs to be given toward how to (1) create a class; (2) identify what needs to be learned; (3) design a flexible curriculum for a working professional; and (4) identify appropriate final project(s) that demonstrates scholarship, creativity, and are built into the learner's practice. The challenge is to make clear that the professional degree signifies deep inquiry into professional practice and the holder of such a credential has a terminal degree in the field. To do this, the items in Table 4 can be fleshed out as standalone characteristics that universities can use to distinguish the professional doctorate from the PhD. This approach could result in better learning experiences and degreeappropriate final projects. The following section is organized around the four challenges posed earlier."}, {"section_title": "Create a Class", "text": "The higher education market is distinct from other markets. David Kirp (2003) makes the point that higher education competes for its inputs--buyers (students) and that tuition dollars do not cover our expenses. We first measure the quality of our academic programs as to what students bring into the program such as GRE scores, years of experience in the field, and job titles that imply success in the field. We congratulate ourselves when we develop diverse cohorts-ethnically, geographically, by gender, and/or by job titles. The goal is to attract the best students (and faculty) for programs that emphasize the development of the scholar/practitioner. While Kirp's remarks center (for the most part) on undergraduate education, they ring even more true in considering the financial models of doctoral education. Not only does tuition alone not pay the expense, in the United States, the institution is expected to support or highly subsidize its PhD students. In the sciences, most universities follow the faculty entrepreneurship model whereby faculty members support their students with externally funded grants. In other fields, financial support has come primarily from student work such as graduate assistantships and teaching assistantships, although the trend toward full support through fellowships and grants is expanding. Professional doctorate students, on the other hand, often pay their tuition with their own funds or with loans. With the exception of those students who receive tuition remission benefits through their workplace (such as those in health care working for hospitals that provide support), the cost of a professional doctorate tends to be the student's responsibility. That said, these students are typically employed full-time and studying part time. Funding isn't quite the same issue for a full-time PhD student. Moreover, the use of GRE (Graduate Record Examination) scores in developing diverse, talented cohorts of professional doctorate students may not be as useful a criterion as with their (often) younger PhD counterparts. According to NYU's Jane Bear-Lehman, chair of the Department of Occupational Therapy, 'institutions that require GRE scores for PhD applicants simply extend this same admissions criteria to the professional doctorate applicant, even though the measurement of writing and math skills may not be indicators of successful degree completion' (Bear-Lehman, personal communications, 2010). Based on the self-assessment, each student identifies five potential goals for the program. These goals must add value to the academic program and cannot be curriculum requirements. Each student is assigned a committee of one tenure line and clinical professor to work with on developing the area or specialty that he or she will document advanced competence. (personal correspondence, October, 2010)"}, {"section_title": "Identify what needs to be learned", "text": "For the EdD in Higher & Postsecondary Education at NYU, curriculum requirements differ for students who have formally studied Higher Education as part of their master's degree and those who have not. All students, however, are encouraged to build on their professional expertise and to add to their skill repertoire via coursework in which they learn to use a variety of knowledge-seeking approaches (inquiry) and reasoned approaches to investigating professional practice and evaluating knowledge sources. A related issue is whether or not to give credit for life experiences (and if so, how to evaluate those experiences) or to simply require a set of experiences as prerequisite for admission. Most universities in the United States follow the latter, establishing a minimum number of credits to be earned, but with flexibility as to which courses, taking former education and background into account when determining the course requirements for the overall program."}, {"section_title": "Design a relevant, flexible curriculum", "text": "If the assumption is that these students have years of field experiences, the challenge is to create learning environments that take into account their knowledge base and their busy work schedules. In addition to developing challenging, experiential, engaging classroom activities such as cases and role playing, the overall curriculum should be structured to ensure that students learn with their faculty, their academic colleagues and their work colleagues. Such an expansionist approach to curriculum is enabled through one of the more distinguishable characteristics of many professional doctoral programs: cohorts--groups of students who are admitted at the same time and by definition go through their program of study together. Students learn with and from their cohort, which becomes a community of learners that supports each other not only in classroom projects but also through candidacy and completion of final projects. While this is a (somewhat) ideal approach, cohorts are notorious for breaking up or being combined. Events in individual adult students' lives may result in their stopping out from time to time. Sometimes small numbers of students in a given cohort result in the need to merge cohorts. Addressing the demands of small cohorts and limited availability of faculty, teams of students from multiple cohorts who work together on thematic dissertations (discussed later) have reportedly reduced the faculty time dedicated to individual dissertation students in half (Marsh et al, 2004). Intensive programs such as Penn's provide opportunity for students to move together beyond knowledge sharing and absorption into knowledge creation."}, {"section_title": "Identify appropriate culminating projects", "text": "Many academic programs with both a professional doctorate and a PhD show curricula with very similar inputs, processes, and outcomes. In fact, dissertations produced by both categories of doctoral students are often incredibly similar, with some professional dissertation findings more generalizable than some PhD dissertation outcomes. But that gets at the need for a distinct culminating project; one that does not necessarily follow the dissertation model. Here are a few examples of innovative approaches: thematic dissertation groups, portfolios & capstones, and projects."}, {"section_title": "Thematic Dissertation Groups", "text": "Faculty members at the University of Southern California have an overarching goal: 'To guide and develop practitioner leaders in urban educational settings to enhance learning of all students' (Marsh et al, 2004: 11). To this end, their EdD in Educational Leadership emphasizes student abilities to analyze complex data and use a wide variety of methods. At a summer institute at the end of their first year of coursework, faculty present areas that they consider significant areas of study, inviting students to join thematic dissertation groups. An example offered by Marsh et al (2004) was a thematic group on violence in urban school settings, whereby a group of K-12 Leadership students and Higher Education Leadership students shared the literature on the topic, provided feedback to each other on method and analysis, completed individual dissertations, but had the added benefit of the groups' findings being published together."}, {"section_title": "Portfolios and Capstones", "text": "Long a staple in master's degrees and in professional degrees such as occupational therapy, portfolios and capstones are excellent vehicles for doctoral candidates to reflect on and demonstrate knowledge gained and applied while studying for their degree. A digital portfolio, begun in the second semester of doctoral study, is required as the culminating project in the DPS in Occupational Therapy discussed earlier. Through the e-portfolio, students document how they have integrated knowledge and skills learned in their individualized curriculum to their specialty practice area (Hinojosa, personal communications, October 2010). The e-portfolio process is summarized through these three steps: 1. First, students complete an analysis of their current practices to determine career goals consistent with their area of specialization. 2. Second, students use their academic coursework and clinical experience to collect 'artifacts' that demonstrate advancement of knowledge, skills, and abilities gained through the integrated academic and clinical work within the program. 3. Third, students organize and catalog their artifacts. In the final course, Professional Portfolio: Advanced Practice E40.3310, students present their eportfolio to a panel of three faculty members. Faculty review the e-portfolio based on the original, professional development plan and its consistency with the evidence-based knowledge in the field of inquiry.

Dissemination products can include any number of policy briefs, publishable articles, presentations at professional conferences, curriculum projects, and the like. For example, one of my EdD students, who is director of graduate admissions at our Stern School of Business, is concerned that the number of female applicants is so much lower than the number of male applications. To examine this problem, she is conducting interviews with women who accepted matriculation to Stern's full-time MBA program as well as women who were accepted but who declined the offer. Her work has implications for understanding women's decision making process in general, and Stern's admission process in particular. Findings may provide useful insights for Stern, and she intends to write a publishable article based on her investigation as well as presenting findings at a professional conference."}, {"section_title": "Garnering public and professional acceptance", "text": "Data reported at the beginning of the paper showed that in the United States, 93% of all doctorates are PhDs. While the holder of a PhD has credibility in the eyes of the profession and the public, the holder of a professional doctorate is often not given similar respect. Trends in doctoral program enrollments show the greatest increases in the professional clinical doctorate, for fields in medicine and health. In 2008, only the professional doctorate in education, the EdD, was shown to be a significant piece of the PhD pie. That said, professions across the board appear to be raising their credentialing bar, and students are eager to learn more. The issue remains, however, that while practitioners and the professions in which they work acknowledge the added value of professional doctorates, some question how (if) the programs are distinct from their masters degree counterparts. In an editorial in a 2007 Chronicle of Higher Education entitled 'Credential Creep', Bollag cited an occupational therapist as saying that in the late 1980s, a bachelor's degree was all that was needed to enter the field of occupational therapy; by the 1990's, a master's degree was expected and that today, a doctorate is becoming the norm (Bollag, 2007). And Bollag (2007: A10)  The last thing education needs to be accused of is creating programs for the sake of creating programs, and the case alluded to by Wiley should not be-and is not-the norm. Curriculum reform efforts such as those sponsored by the Carnegie Foundation are underway in many fields, and their recommendations are beginning to be disseminated and acted upon. Perhaps as professional doctorates become more rigorous, they also will be more widely accepted by their professions and the general public as terminal degrees. It has been proposed, for example, that EdDs should be accredited by a 'self-regulating association of an elite group of universities pledging to establish and adhere to high admission, program, and performance standards', and that a National Academy of Educational Leadership, federally chartered and financially subsidized, and driven to high standards by a national board of prestigious laypersons, academics, and educational practitioners should be formed (Guthrie & Marsh, 2009). Perhaps the thinking here is that if the EdD had professional licensing requirements and well-known professional organizational affiliations it would be more widely accepted as a terminal degree. When all is said and done, however, it's when quality, rigorous programs-programs that are distinct from their PhD counterparts-are developed and when students' final projects have an impact on practice and policy in the field that acclaim will be assured. Despite these vexing issues, the consensus is that the holder of a professional doctorate, a scholar-practitioner, has unique insights into his or her field and an ability to not only understand practice, but to create mechanisms to improve practice and policy. This should speak volumes for their acceptance in all fields. Debra Stewart, president of the Council of Graduate Schools in Washington, D.C., summarized national reports on the importance of all graduate education saying: Our country's graduate schools produce the people with the advanced knowledge and skills essential to guaranteeing the country's future economic and social prosperity. We must secure the future by producing people who can understand, use, and develop methodologies of inquiry and people who are able to synthesize complex information within their own field and across related fields; and scholars and professionals who routinely exercise critical and analytical judgment. And with those core abilities, graduate degree holders will allow us to address the complex, compelling issues of our time. (Stewart, 2010: 36). While debate exists as to the importance of a professional doctorate beyond a master's degree, enrollment data make clear that more education is considered better than less education. Students are eager to earn a credential that provides unique credibility and results in their being called 'doctor'. Through completion of professional doctoral degrees, individuals make it clear that they are way beyond competent; they are strategic problem solvers-able to use skills in inquiry to analyze data to improve practice and policy. More important perhaps than the actual credential, the holder of a professional doctorate has expressed his or her commitment to the field, a willingness to engage in the development of high level expertise, and the ability to translate knowledge into action. The numbers of students earning doctoral degrees in the United States is increasing; however, in areas outside medicine and law, the PhD remains the degree of choice for most students and for the institutions that hire them. While professional degree programs are being developed, some programs tend to be one-of-a-kind and not particularly rigorous. Therefore, ongoing professional doctorate curriculum reform initiatives, such as those supported by the Carnegie Foundation, are working to ensure that doctoral preparation programs are relevant and adhere to professional standards. The debate in the United States has moved from whether or not to do this to exactly how best to do this, and the debate around professional doctorate curricula is often around issues that are unique to the needs of the practitioner-scholar. These issues include how to create a class, build curricula that build on the knowledge base of the learner, and develop thesis or final project options that are clearly differentiated from PhDs. With demand for new ways to tackle complex problems in the professions rising and the public's call for academic relevancy increasing, it is vital that we work to create outstanding professional doctorate programs that are crafted toward the study of professional practices and policies within an expansionist framework that ensures that students and faculty can work together to develop new solutions to increasingly complex problems."}]
