[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has spread worldwide with alarming speed and has led to the worst healthcare crisis in a century. The agent of COVID-19, the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus (family Coronaviridae), has a ~30 Kb positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome predicted to encode ten open reading frames (ORFs)1. Similar to other RNA viruses, coronaviruses undergo mutation and recombination2,3 that may be critical to understanding physiological responses and disease sequelae, prompting the need for comprehensive characterization of multiple and varied viral isolates.\nTo date, reports highlighting genomic variation of SARS-CoV-2 have primarily used amplicon-based sequencing approaches (e.g., ARTIC)4\u20137. Attaining uniform target coverage is difficult for amplicon-based methods, and is exacerbated by issues of poor sample quality8. Genome variation in the amplicon primer region may also impact sequence assembly. Transcriptome characterization can further contribute to our knowledge of mutation within the SARS-CoV-2 genome, and direct RNA long read sequencing, both alone and in combination with short read sequencing, have been described1,9,10. Unfortunately, these analyses are equally hampered by sample quality limitations and necessitate use of cultured cell lines.\nOligonucleotide capture (\u2018capture\u2019) mitigates these issues as hybridization to specific probes not only enriches for target sequences but enables the analysis of degraded source material11\u201314. Capture enrichment has also been applied to viral sequencing, where a panvirome probe design resulted in up to 10,000-fold enrichment of the target sequence and flanking regions15,16. Hybridization-based enrichment of RNAs can also aid in the identification of gene fusions or splice variants12,17,18, which are particularly important for coronavirus biology. In addition to encoding a polyprotein that undergoes autocatalyzed hydrolysis, coronaviruses employ subgenomic RNA fragments generated by discontinuous transcription to translate proteins required for viral replication and encapsidation. These subgenomic RNA fragments share a common 62-bp leader sequence derived from the 5\u2019 end of the viral genome, detectable as a fused junction to interior ORFs1,9. Direct RNA sequencing of cultured cell lines infected with SARS-CoV-2 revealed that the junctional sequences are not evenly distributed between the ORFs, suggesting that individual proteins may be translated at different rates1. How virus translation profiles from infected human patients differ from those from cultured cells is as yet unknown.\nHere we have utilized capture probes and a streamlined workflow for sequence analysis of both the SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences and of the junction reads contained within the genomic subfragments generated by discontinuous transcription (Fig.1). The method can be applied at scale to analyze samples from clinical isolates. Enriching for genomic and transcriptional RNA, followed by deep short-read sequencing, sheds light on variation in clinical SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences and expression profiles."}, {"section_title": "Sequencing results and capture enrichment efficiency ::: Results", "text": "A total of 7.15 billion raw reads were generated for the 45 SARS-CoV-2 positive samples sequenced (Supplementary Table 1). Sequences were trimmed to filter low quality reads and subsequently mapped to the GRCh38 reference genome to identify human reads (Fig. 2A). Trimmed non-human sequence reads were analyzed using the VirMAP19 pipeline where between 7\u2013 86.4% of total reads from post-capture libraries mapped to the SARS-CoV-2 reference. One sample (192000446B), which had only 6.37 ng total RNA starting material, did not generate any SARS-CoV-2 reads. Overall, the percentage of reads represented by SARS-CoV-2 was higher in samples with CDC protocol-based RT-qPCR Ct values <33 (Fig. 2A). To estimate the capture enrichment efficiency, pre-capture libraries for nine samples, ranging in Ct values of 20.4 to 37.95 (i.e. high to low titer in the original samples), were also sequenced, generating 152.1 \u2013 322.9 million reads per sample. Samples 192000106B and 192000090B, with Ct > 37 produced zero reads mapping to the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome. In the remaining seven samples, less than 0.022% of reads were deemed SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 2B). Collectively, post-capture enrichment increased the SARS-CoV-2 mapping rate to 50.9%, a 9,243-fold enrichment.\nSpiked synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA, encompassing six fragments of 5 Kb each, served as a positive control and were enriched successfully at both 1,500 and 150k copies per sample (Fig. 2C). In the 1,500 copy libraries (n=2), 3\u20135% of reads mapped to the SARS-CoV-2 genome, while approximately 65% of reads from the 150k copy libraries (n=2) did the same (Supplementary Table 1). This translates to an approximate 91,858-fold enrichment in the 1,500 copy libraries and 13,778-fold enrichment in the 150k copy libraries compared to their starting amounts in the RNA. Three SARS-CoV-2 PCR negative samples were also sequenced, where <0.5% of reads mapped to the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome at 3\u20135 locations that are not conserved in the SARS-CoV-2 genome (Supplementary Table 1; Supplementary Fig. 1)."}, {"section_title": "Genome reconstruction and genomic variations ::: Results", "text": "In order to assess the ability of the capture methodology to assemble full-length genomes, both the nine pre-capture and 45 post capture libraries were assembled using both the VirMAP pipeline and the SPAdes de novo assembler20.\nFull-length SARS-CoV-2 genomes were obtained from 17 of the 45 capture-enriched samples. Genome coverage in these 17 samples varied from 1071x to 3.19x million (Supplementary Table 1). Successful full-length genome assembly was correlated with Ct values below 33 (Fig. 3), regardless of the total reads generated during sequencing. Two samples with Ct values above 33, 192000296 (Ct 33.9) and 192000354 (Ct 35.5), obtained from a single patient, also yielded full-length genome reconstructions with acceptable quality (N \u2264 0.5%). Partial genome reconstructions were achieved for the remaining samples although somewhat surprisingly, the correlation between percentage of the genome that was reconstructed and the Ct value of that sample was not tightly correlated when Ct values were above 33 (Fig. 3). Full-length genome sizes of the 17 capture-enriched and assembled sequences varied from 29.68 Kb to 30.15 Kb (Supplementary Fig. 2). Variants relative to the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome sequence NC_045512.2, including single nucleotide polymorphisms and a single indel, ranged from 5 to 15 per sample, with a mean of nine.\nOut of the nine pre-capture samples, three (192000072B, 192000021B, 1920000003B), all with Ct values \u2264 27.4, yielded full-length genomes with 28x \u2013 265x genome coverage, while in the other four samples, genome reconstructions were partial and also had a poor genome coverage of 1\u20136x. SARS-CoV-2 reads were not detected in the two remaining samples.\nAlignment of DNA sequence reads from one sample (192000051B) to the reference SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence NC_045512.2 that is based on the first published isolate from Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 reference genome, revealed multiple heterogenous alleles (Fig. 4; Supplementary Fig. 3). Most isolates spreading into Europe derive from the \u2018B\u2019 lineage (based on the Wuhan sequence), but three samples including this sample contained an additional fraction of reads representing the A lineage21 (Supplementary Table 2). Further investigation of the clinical correlates of this observation are underway. The genomic position 23,403 in the Wuhan reference strain had good coverage in 28 of the capture enriched samples. The A-to-G nucleotide mutation at this location that results in the Spike protein D614G amino acid change was noticed in 23 of the 28 samples22."}, {"section_title": "Characterization of SARS-CoV-2 subgenomic mRNAs ::: Results", "text": "To identify and quantitate subgenome-length mRNAs, reads were aligned to the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome NC_045512.2. Only samples with full-length genomes (N=17 capture and N=5 pre-capture) were analyzed for junction reads to avoid introduction of any bias in identifying subgenomic RNA due to gaps in sequence coverage (Fig. 5A and Supplementary Table 3). While full-length genomes were reconstructed from three pre-capture samples, an additional two samples with >95% genomes reconstructed, 192000135B (with 97.4%) and 192000088B (95.3%), were also included in this comparison (Fig. 5A and in Supplementary Table 4).To characterize ORF expression in the capture and pre-capture libraries, the number of junction reads/million were calculated and plotted in Fig. 5A (see details in Supplementary Table 3). Among the five pre- and post-capture comparison pairs, junction reads were identified in more ORFs after capture, and in instances where junction reads were found before and after capture, the expression trend agreed between the two groups.\nIn the capture libraries, junction reads were identified in all 17 samples in the S gene, followed by ORF8 in 16 samples, ORF3a and ORFa in 14 sample samples, N gene in 13 samples, M gene in 11 and ORF6 in 10 samples with remaining ORFs seen in between 3 to 10 samples. Junction reads containing canonical leader sequences were not identified in ORF1ab in any sample, suggesting the translation of ORF1ab from genomic RNA is independent of the canonical leader sequence. The average number of junction reads/million was highest for ORF3a (176.3), followed by ORF8 (104.3) and S gene (10.8). The N gene junction reads/million average was skewed due to its high presence in sample 192000052B. Log transformed values are shown in Fig. 5A. For the remaining genes, the average was less than 10 junction reads/million. The expression of ORF10 gene was detected in three of the 17 samples (192000052B, 192000251B, and 192000440B) with expression values of 0.13, 0.13 and 0.02 reads/million (Supplementary Fig. 4). Among the 17 libraries with full-length genomes, there is only one pair 192000296B (Ct 33.8) and 192000354B (Ct 35.5), sampled twice from the same subject (Patient #12) and the junction read expression was lower but detectable in both of these samples (Supplementary Table 3).\nThere were no gaps in the ORF read coverage in any of the 17 capture samples (Fig. 5B). From 5\u2019 to 3\u2019 of the genome, there was a gradual increase in the read coverage as expected, for the genomic and subgenomic (transcriptomic) RNA reads. Across the genes in these 17 samples, ORF1ab and ORF3a had the lowest reads per kilobase million (RPKM) values (average 32509 and 27957 RPKM, respectively) while the highest values were seen for ORF10 with a count of 121,643 (Fig. 5B)."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "We employed a hybridization-based oligonucleotide capture methodology, combined with short DNA read sequencing, for culture-free genome reconstruction and transcriptome characterization of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The approach provided complete viral genome sequences and identified sub genomic fragments containing ORFs, shedding light on SARS-CoV-2 transcription in clinical samples. This method uses routine cDNA and library preparation along with Illumina sequencing, employing 96 or more barcodes. Patient samples can be pooled for capture and sequencing, to generate sequence data in large numbers.\nThe capture method provided considerable enrichment of SARS-CoV-2 in all samples tested. The enrichment efficiency was calibrated using two spike-in synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA controls, and yielded a 91,858-fold enrichment in the 1,500 copy (Ct=36.2), libraries and 13,778-fold enrichment in the 150k copy (Ct=29.6) reconstructed samples. For nine patient samples, where sequence data from pre and post capture libraries were compared, a 9,243-fold enrichment was observed. Some human sequences were observed in the data generated from low viral load samples (CT>33) and these were removed in silico15, and did not effectively interfere with the enrichment. Some unevenness in SARS-CoV-2 sequence representation was initially observed when pooling samples within a range of Ct. values. This was managed by pooling groups of samples based upon their range of CT values before capture enrichment. Full length SARS-CoV-2 genomes were able to be assembled from 17 of the 45 samples analyzed. High quality, full-length reconstructions from capture enrichment appears to be reliably achieved with a viral Ct \u226433. Between a Ct of 33 and 36, the full-length genome is recovered in some samples while partial genomes, consisting of >50% of the genome length, were reconstructed for the majority (Fig. 3). This observation is consistent with the results reported for multiplex amplicon-based approaches by CDC23 where the multiplex PCR strategy is also effective at generating full length genome sequences \u2264Ct of 33.\nCapture enrichment enabled identification of a mixed population of SARS-CoV-2 virus in sample 192000051B, including a putative defective interfering viral RNA species that likely is incapable of translating the viral polyprotein encoded in ORF1ab alongside a replication competent strain. All heterogeneously called alleles are in ORF1ab, the 20 kb gene encoding the polyprotein essential to the replication of the viral genome. Only one of these alleles (T20520C) is expected to produce a synonymous change in the coding sequence. All the other loci are predicted to change the amino acid sequence of the polyprotein. Most notable is T1783A, which introduced a stop codon early in the translation of ORF1ab. Introduced stop codons are rare among the submitted genome assemblies tracking the evolution of SARS-CoV2 (nextstrain.org), but are distributed all along the genome (Supplementary Fig. 3). In some regions, these introduced stop codon alleles occur in multiple loci along multiple lineages, one of which at a significant enough frequency to be scored with high homoplasy24. The low phylogenetic signal disqualifies these loci from much further analysis. A stop codon early in the ORF1ab gene should prevent propagation of the virus, but it can possibly be complemented by the presence of a functional copy of the gene from a co-infecting replication competent virus.\nDefective interfering viral RNA can be replicated and packaged in the presence of replicating viruses, and have been detected in other coronaviruses25. If the requirement for translational fidelity of the ORF1ab gene were lost, it would remove any selective pressure on the remainder of the gene and could explain the accumulation of additional mutations observed in the defective species. It would not interfere with the generation of sub genomic segments of the rest of the genome for translation of the proteins necessary to package the virus. Thus, the defective virus can only be maintained in a heterogeneous population with a replication competent virus. Engineering defective interfering viruses have the potential to modulate the replication of functional viruses during the infection cycle.\nOur capture approach enabled simultaneous detection and quantitation of the sub genomic fragments. Kim et al.1, reported SARS-CoV-2 quantitative expression in SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero cells (ATCC, CCL-81) based on junction reads obtained from Nanopore based direct RNA sequencing. In their study, the N gene mRNA was the most abundantly expressed, but they also identified expression in eight other ORFs with least expression noted in the 7b gene. They did not detect sub genomic fragments enabling translation of ORF10. Here, we searched for junctions reads in our data and used them to quantitate ORF expression patterns in the 17 samples with full length genome reconstructions (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Tables 3 and 4). Differences in expression were noted among these 17 samples suggesting that ORF expression is patient-specific and interestingly, this patient group expression pattern also differed from the profiles reported by Kim et al.1,. Further, evidence of the expression of ORF10 was supported by multiple junction reads in three of our 17 samples (192000052B, 192000251B, and 192000440B). The SARS-CoV-2 genome coverage in these three samples was among the highest (3,192,285x, 1,196,745x, and 793,028x), which might have contributed to their discovery (Supplementary. Table 1). ORF10 was also undetected in the other transcriptome study by Taiaroa et al., 2020 using ONT and SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero/hSLAM cells. ORF10 is 117 bases in length so it may have been missed by these studies due to its low or absent expression in cultured cells. We note however that the capture methodology is limited in its ability to identify the RNA modifications that were reported by the above two direct RNA-Seq methods.\nIn summary, this capture enrichment and sequencing method provides an effective approach to generate SARS-CoV-2 genome and transcriptome data directly from clinical samples. Samples with Ct values \u226433, when sequenced to a depth of approximately 2 million reads (higher than 1000x coverage of the SARS-CoV-2 genome), appear to be sufficient for both full genome reconstruction and identification and quantitation of junction-reads to measure differential ORF expression. This method has a straightforward work-flow and is scalable for sequencing large numbers of patient samples."}, {"section_title": "COVID-19 viral testing, Collection, RNA extraction and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT- PCR). ::: Methods", "text": "The CLIA Certified Respiratory Virus Diagnostic Laboratory (ID#: 45D0919666) at Baylor College of Medicine performed real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests for SARS-CoV-2 on mid-turbinate nasal swab samples collected from adults presenting to the hospitals or clinics at the Texas Medical Center from March 18 through April 25, 2020.
