[{"section_title": "", "text": "The Australian Pharmaceutical Industry and its Global Context George Messinis"}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Our intuition of a modern economy has undergone a radical shift in the 1990s. Now, knowledge creation and innovation are seen as crucial indicators of economic vitality and social welfare. In fact, the knowledge content in OECD economies has intensified over the last two decades (OECD 2001). The high-technology sector plays a crucial role in the \"knowledge economy\". It contributes significantly to economic growth and is a major investor in knowledge. Developments in the science/evolution literature reinforce the above shift in economic thinking. A new hypothesis has emerged. Summarised in the term \"global brain\", it emphasises \"group selection\" as the driving force of human evolution (Bloom 2000). In contrast to the neo Darwinian view of \"individual selection\", the new hypothesis reemphasises the old view of humans as \"social animals\" and the imperative of group think, associations and networks as a superior \"learning machine\". Global brain is defined as: \u2026a worldwide-webbed intelligence which telegraphs its knowledge more instantaneously than do we, a group brain without parallel in creativity, the microbial mesh which links quadrillions of individuals into its processing machinery. (p. 209) Professor Bloom also refers to the pharmaceutical industry as a very active player at the frontier of global brain evolution. The recent genetic coding of the Human Genome and the \"astonishing surge of medicines\" seem consistent with the Landau, Achilladelis and Scriabine (1999) view that the pharmaceutical industry has revolutionised human health. The pharmaceutical industry features prominently in the high-technology sector. It relies heavily on a workforce with high education and research skills. The general perception is that, over the last 15 years, the industry has become a significant manufacturing sector in terms of production, investment, innovation, international trade and employment. The industry has attracted considerable research energy in recent times. However, most of the studies are limited to the microeconomics of pharmaceuticals and health and only fragments of the big picture are recorded. 1 For such an important industry, it seems high priority to obtain an integrated, comprehensive, global view of the industry. According to Gambardella et al. (2000), the birth of the pharmaceutical industry is almost synonymous with Europe but more recently there is a \"diffused perception\" that Europe has lost its competitiveness when compared with the USA. The authors confirm the view of Europe as a laggard but highlight the fact that Europe is not a homogenous group. In the light of this, we re-examine the most recent evidence. Australia has a reputation as a nation with a highly educated population and a strong information and communication infrastructure. There has been some time since the pioneering work of AEA (1998) that outlined the profile of the Australian pharmaceutical industry. Although some of the empirical challenges in Australia remain, there have been important developments since 1998. First, it has now become more transparent that health care is a critical element of social welfare. This is particularly relevant in view of the fact that the Australian population is aging. Second, the industry has been identified as a major contributor to innovation and health improvements. Most recently, the Australian Government has been developing an Action Agenda in order to promote the sustainable development of the industry (DISR 2000(DISR , 2002. Third, new data have appeared. In this paper, we seek to obtain a more comprehensive view of the industry. The paper is organised as follows. Part two takes a global view by examining OECD trends. Part three focuses further on the Australian industry. We seek to ascertain what Australia's contribution has been and how the industry evolved within the manufacturing sector. Finally, we summarise our findings and conclude."}, {"section_title": "OECD Trends: 1987-2000", "text": "Based on existing literature, we are interested in the following questions. How has business activity evolved in the long-term? How does the industry compare with other sectors? Which nations have contributed most to the development of the industry? Towards answers, we examine indicators such as value-added, international trade, business R&D expenditure (BERD), employment and earnings."}, {"section_title": "Production and Consumption", "text": "The rise of the global pharmaceutical industry is well documented. 2 Much of the literature has identified strong growth in sales and health expenditures in OECD countries. Table 1 indicates that private health expenditure has grown substantially during the 1990s with consumers in the USA, Korea and Greece placing a high budget priority in health-related consumption. 3 The UK records the lowest consumption share while growth in Australia has been below average. In nominal terms, much stronger growth in sales is evident that reflects the well-known growth in health expenditures by the public sector. Consumption Average annual growth  Share (%) Consumption (a) Sales (b) 1988-1999OECD Health Data 2002;ABS (cat. no. 5206). OECD (2001) has identified high-technology sectors to be major contributors to economic growth, international trade and BERD. We are interested to know how the pharmaceutical industry has performed and whether some countries play a relatively more important role in the development of the industry. On prior information, we would expect the USA to have overtaken Europe as a leader. We begin with value added as a key indicator. We focus on the 15 biggest players denoted as OECD-15. 4 Figure 1 clearly shows that the industry adds considerable value with the USA and Japan contributing most to the global economy. In growth terms, however, Figure 2 shows that several European countries made good progress; Norway, Denmark and Sweden recorded the highest growth rates. Given a high base level, growth in the USA seems remarkable.   The share of the former has increased substantially in Belgium, Denmark, Sweden and the USA by 3%, 4%, 3.3% and 1.9% respectively. This progress contrasts with the 1% change of Europe-10 and the relatively small shares in Canada, Germany and Japan.  In a global competitive environment, it is also important to assess a nation's relative performance. Figure 4 takes into account of OECD trends and focuses on the world (i.e., OECD) distribution of value added. It now becomes obvious that France, Japan and the UK performed relatively worse than the USA with the latter increasing its OECD share from 36.5% in 1987 to 48% in 2000. On the other hand, Europe-10 and Japan have both lost share to the USA with a loss of 4.5% and 7.2% points. Our earlier finding Europe as a heterogenous group is again confirmed: Belgium, Denmark, Sweden, Netherlands and Norway have all increased their share.  Another useful indicator is labour productivity (value added per employee). Due to data limitations, we settle for per capital value added that shows how productive the average person has been in a particular country. Figure 5 adjusts for population differences and depicts the trend in per capita value added for the pharmaceutical industry. Here the re is a repeat of the pattern in figure 3 above. As well as in the USA, the average person in Denmark, and Sweden has substantially increased its value-added contribution to world GDP for the period 1987-2000. Note, Denmark has already been identified as 'extremely focused' on pharmaceuticals (European Commission 1997, p.273). It is interesting that the birthplace of pharmaceuticals accounted for only 32.5% of the total value added in OECD-15 in 1987. Moreover, Europe-10 has lagged further behind with a 4.5% reduction in its OECD-15 share, mainly due to a 2.3% and 2.1% loss by Germany and the UK respectively. We hasten to add, however, that both Canada and Japan have also seen their share diminish by 1.2% and 7.2% respectively. In summary, we have found the pharmaceutical industry one of the fastest growing sectors within manufacturing. The USA has further consolidated its world leadership in terms of its contribution to world value added in pharmaceuticals. As a group, Europe has lagged behind but so has Japan and Canada. In per capita terms, small north European countries have made extraordinary progress over the 1990s."}, {"section_title": "International Trade", "text": "Next, we examine the role of the industry in international trade. One would intuitively expect a knowledge-based industry such as pharmaceuticals to translate its high value added into better trade performance. Table 2 looks at exports and imports in relation to production. The export ratio reflects an economy's capacity to satisfy world demand. The table illustrates a wide variation in export ratios with Denmark and Sweden surpassing all other countries. Note also, Australia came third last in 1998. Columns 3-4 present evidence on import penetration as an indicator of one's reliance on imports. Australia has recorded a ratio that is well above the OECD average.  Table 3 further summarises the trade profile (also an indicator of openness) of various industries in OECD and Australia in the 1990s. OECD trade has grown particularly strong in aerospace, petrol products/nuclear fuel, and office/accounting/computing machinery. The pharmaceutical industry ranks fifth in terms of growth (3.1%) and its share in manufacturing. With the exception of shipping, the industry's trade share in manufacturing has grown faster than any other sector in Australia (i.e., 6.9%). Compared with total OECD, however, it appears that the industry is not as highly represented in Australian trade. In fact, this is consistent with Australia's lower than average OECD performance in high/ medium-high technology industries, defined in terms of high R&D intensity (i.e., R&D expenditure as a % of production or gross product). That said, column 2 of the same table indicates that Australia has seen strong export growth in medium-high technolo gy sectors in the 1990s. In summary, pharmaceutical products constitute a significant proportion of trade in manufacturing and that share has grown recently. The trade share of pharmaceuticals in Australia is almost half of the average OECD but there has been much progress in the 1990s. Despite the low representation of the high-technology sector in trade in Australia, the pharmaceutical industry stands out as the biggest sector in that industry group. "}, {"section_title": "Business R&D Expenditure (BERD)", "text": "Much of the growth in the global pharmaceutical industry can be attributed to its capacity to innovate and thus add substantial value to a growing world market for improved health. This is an industry where innovation is closely associated with scientific breakthroughs and technological progress. Figure 6 is a time-series plot of new patents granted in USA for ethical drugs. The former clearly illustrates the fact that innovation output has accelerated in the pharmaceutical industry since 1994, has declined in 2000 but recovered in 2001. The 1990s trend compared favourably with the aggregate trend towards increased innovation in the USA. Since patent do not exactly translate into new products, we also consider a series of new drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration since 1990. Business R&D expenditure (BERD) is critical to innovation in pharmaceuticals. It is thus Not surprising that the industry invests heavily in R&D: ranked third in 2000 (table 4). Also, it is one of the most profitable in the world.  Table 5 further focuses on R&D intensity in order to compare the performance of the pharmaceutical industry with other industries for 13 major OECD countries. 6 Again the industry takes third place in the USA, Canada, Europe and Australia. In terms of the level of intensity, Australia ranks second last above Spain. In pharmaceuticals, note also that Sweden remains the absolute leader (i.e., see European Commission 1997, p.47) with the UK in second place. Although tables 4-5 do not precisely depict world distribution of R&D expenditure, it is widely known that BERD is heavily concentrated in OECD. Only seven of OECD countries attract 87% of the total OECD funds and the USA accounts for 44% (NFS 2002, p. 4-43). Given the leadership of the USA, it is also interesting to observe the R&D flows from USA to the world. Details from an industry survey conducted by the manufacturers association (PhRMA 2002) clearly shows that of the total 2000 R&D spending abroad, 52.3% went to West Europe, 5.3% to Canada, 12.1% to Japan and 1.1% to both Australia and NZ. This compares sharply with their OECD population shares being 40%, 2.8%, 11.5% and 2.1% respectively. 7 Next we examine developments in the global industry over the period 1987-2000. The international standard for measuring R&D expenditure is set out by the Frascati Manual (see OECD 1994). Guided by the Frascati Manual, the OECD ANBERD database is a consistent source of data that applies the same definition throughout OECD. The Manual adheres to performer-based reporting and seeks to correctly identify the sums an organisation or sector has received from another unit. In order for these funds to be counted as BERD, the \"transfer must be both intended and used for the performance of R&D\" (OECD 1994, p.21). We begin with table 6 that summarises R&D expenditure in pharmaceuticals over the period 1976-2000. Figure 7 depicts the OECD distribution of BERD for 1987 and 2000. Here we observe the bulk of OECD BERD being increasingly absorbed by the USA whose share has risen by 2.9% points to 42%. Europe has seen a small decrease of its share (from 42.1% down to 41.4%) but the most adverse outcome was in Japan with a loss of 3.3% points. Italy and Germany have also seen a sharp decline. Except Spain, all other European countries have improved their performance, especially the UK and Sweden.   Table 7 compares the R&D expenditure by the pharmaceutical industry to total BERD. We observe the industry expenditure to be a significant component of total BERD. Most discernible is the dramatic (relative) increase in Denmark, Sweden and the UK with the latter becoming the world leader in the 1990s.  Figure 8 is a plot of per capita BERD in 1987 and 2000. Clearly, figure 8 reveals a vastly different pattern to that presented above. It illustrates the capacity of some small nations (in terms of population) to attract considerable R&D business funding. Ireland, Sweden, the UK, Denmark and Belgium stand out. More precisely, the average person in Ireland, Sweden and Denmark has made remarkable progress if we consider that these nations have increased their BERD by 270%, 164% and 156% respectively within a 13-year interval; Most interesting is the fact that, as a group, Europe-10 has raised its per capita BERD by 10% per annum; the corresponding rates for Japan, the USA and OECD-15 are 6.6%, 8.1% and 9.4% respectively. Source: OECD (1998,2001) ANBERD Database. We further advance our study of R&D practices by utilising an alternative data source for BERD. OECD Health Data 2002 provides access to industry data that is independent of ANBERD for Canada, Denmark, Germany and the USA. This database relies on industry surveys that measures R&D expenditure according to the source of funding devoted to R&D and contrasts with the ANBERD approach reporting on an R&D performer-basis. In contrast to ANBERD that strictly follows the Frascati Manual, the Health Data draws from industry sources. For the USA, the Health Data extracts its information from the Annual Membership Survey of Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA). PhRMA (2002) defines R&D expenditures as the \"total cost incurred for all pharmaceutical R&D activity\" which includes depreciation and \"total outlays for all research and development work contracted to others (manufacturers, independent research laboratories, academic institutions, etc.)\" (p. 94). Thus, one potentially major difference in the treatment of BERD between ANBERD and PhRMA is extramural expenditure that is excluded in the former but included in the latter. 8 Figure 9 illustrates the reporting gap for the above four countries since 1973. We propose below that a major component of the gap relates to subcontracting. If that is valid, it appears the USA has taken an early lead and only to be overtaken by Denmark in the late 1990s. Also worth noting is that Germany has largely abstained from the practice of subcontracting. In fact, Germany has recorded a negative gap and we interpret that as a sign of heavy subsidisation of BERD by government and other sectors.  Figure 10 repeats the exercise in figure 1 but we replace ANBERD data with industry data for Canada, Denmark, Germany and the USA. Note that now the USA leadership seems more overwhelming than with ANBERD data. The USA is one of a few countries to have gained OECD market share in the 1990s: a gain of 12.9% points to raise its share to 55%. It is this extraordinary outcome that has raised serious concerns in Europe. EFPIA (2002), for instance, concludes that BERD is increasingly concentrated in the USA and Europe has lost its competitiveness. Against this trend, it is also interesting that Denmark, Ireland, Sweden have all managed to increase their OECD share. Of course, the disappointing result for Europe remains with a loss of market share from 40% down to 33%. Note also that Europe was not alone; Japan lost 6.7% points. Not reported here, however, the pattern in per capita figures remain similar to that in figure 8, except that a much better performance is recorded for Denmark and the USA. The strong differential BERD performance amongst European countries warrants further analysis. We briefly explore higher education as a potential factor. Not reported here, we investigated the role of higher education enrolments as a lagged predictor of R&D and observed a low correlation. Next, we examine the hypothesis that business will seek to invest on R&D if returns are high. Obviously, a prerequisite for the latter is the capacity of a nation to contribute to world knowledge creation and innovation. As a proxy for that, we select per capita scientific publications in the fields of chemistry, biology, biomedical research and clinical medicine. The role of higher education as a potential driver of technological progress and innovation is a central proposition in modern economic growth theory (Wolf 2001). Scientific Papers in the Life Sciences, 1999 (per 100,000) Per capita BERD, 2000 Note: BERD data are as in Figure 10 Figure 11 is a scatter plot of per capita scientific papers in Life Sciences in 1999 against per capita BERD in pharmaceuticals. In addition to OECD-15, we also include Switzerland, given its strong profile in pharmaceuticals. Our regression estimation provides for alternative functional forms. Linear regression produces a statistically significant result with scientific papers correlating positively with per capita BERD in 2000. We experimented with various functional forms with the cubic producing the most significant outcome. We observe countries such as Switzerland, Sweden and Denmark to be leaders i n scientific publications and that seems to influence business decisions with respect to R&D. According to either of the two functions, countries such as Australia, Canada and Spain under-perform in BERD while Denmark, the UK and Belgium seem to over-invest in R&D. We now return to the issue of sub-contracting to further understand business R&D practices. Apparently, there is a blurring of the distinction between intramural and extramural R&D expenditures. Young (2001) speculates that most of 'extramural' (i.e., R&D activities funded by a pharmaceutical firm but conducted outside the firm) relate to clinical evaluation in phases I to III. These are integral to the R&D and innovation process. She, however, acknowledges that insufficient reporting does not allow us to identify the nature of the activity or the performer when R&D is contracted out. For example, PhRMA (2000) advises that R&D expenditures 'outside firm' include funds \"contracted or granted\" to other companies or \"other research-performing organisations\". Such a broad definition makes it difficult to reconcile industry figures with Frascati. Figure 12 confirms the view that the reporting R&D gap for the USA can be attributed to extramural or 'outside firm' expenditures. Outsourcing and sub-contracting has become an important business practice in the USA in recent times. We expect the pharmaceutical industry to reflect that trend. We utilise NSF electronic data to further explore this possibility. Figure 13 plots the BERD gap against estimates of contracted R&D expenditure in the \"drugs and medicines\" industry in the Survey of Industrial Research and Development conducted by the U.S. Bureau of Census (i.e., original source of ANBERD). Obviously, contracted R&D expenditure constitutes a large share of the gap. Yet, 41% of the gap in 1996-98 was associated with practices other than contracted R&D, such as grants and scholarships. Nevertheless, subcontracting has become part of the landscape and it is not confined to the pharmaceutical industry (figure 13). The figure also depicts contracted R&D in pharmaceuticals as a share of total contracted R&D in the economy. This series clearly indicates an acceleration of contracted BERD in pharmaceuticals since 1987 well beyond the general upward trend. More precisely, while BERD in the industry accounted for an average of 13.6% over the period , it has steadily risen to 41.4% of the total contracted BERD in 1998.  1973 1976 1979 1982 1985 1988 1991 1994 1997 2000 US $ (million)   1976 1979 1982 1985 1988 1991 1994 1997 Million   We summarise the evidence in this sub-section. We find the industry to be strong in patents and R&D intensive. The USA has become the undisputable leader in as far as absolute expenditure on R&D is concerned. Overall, the pharmaceutical industry has seen its R&D expenditure to grow stronger than total BERD. While Japan and Germany have witnessed a substantial decline, several European countries have devoted considerable funds for R&D. We propose that a strong science base is a key determinant of superior performance in per capita BERD. Last but not least, we observe a new strong trend towards subcontracting of R&D activities in the USA and Denmark."}, {"section_title": "Employment and Labour Compensation", "text": "R&D statistics may provide an incomplete assessment of the industry's contribution to innovation and/or social welfare. One reason for that is the fact that R&D expenditure constitutes only one input to innovation. Gambardella et al. (2000) have observed that the industry in Europe is weak in BERD but seems more labour intensive than in North America. Thus, it is of interest to examine labour statistics. Table 8 compares six OECD countries in terms of employment and earnings growth. Australia has seen the strongest growth in job creation and earnings. 10 Figure 15 presents an indicator of quality jobs by adjusting for differences in the labour force. It indicates average earnings 11 over the period 1995-2000. Australia now takes a second-last position with average earnings at $39,185 (US PPP), just above Mexico's $33,169. The earnings gap between Australia and France ($66,138), the UK (479,015) or the USA ($85,925) now seems substantial. Next, we investigate whether the earnings gap is due to differences in the wage structure and manufacturing in general. Figure 16 compares the pharmaceutical industry to total manufacturing in 1995. Due to data restrictions, Figure 16 excludes Mexico but includes Belgium and Spain. Again, the lowest average earnings appear in Australia and the highest in the USA. More importantly, earnings differences between countries can partly be a ttributed to overall differences in manufacturing. However, the ratio between earnings in pharmaceuticals and in (average) earnings in manufacturing seems to vary considerably: 1.21 for Australia, 1.23 for Belgium, 1.35 for Denmark, 1.57 for France, 1.84 for Spain, 1.76 for the UK and 1.52 for the USA. In summary, the evidence in this sub-section suggests that the global pharmaceutical industry provides higher value jobs than other sectors but this is less so in Australia than in countries such as the UK and the USA."}, {"section_title": "Australia: 1970-2000", "text": "Discussion in the previous sections focused on global trends and OECD data. With respect to the latter, AEA (1998) makes it clear that the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) approach to measurement of R&D expenditure and production differs from that adopted by OECD. ABS data on R&D is classified according to production while OECD emphasises product fields. Furthermore, ABS R&D collection data has management as the unit of measurement. Towards consistency, ABS has recently revised its Manufacturing Survey to move away from an establishments-based data and adopt the management-unit approach. This change will now allow for the differentiation between medicinal pharmaceutical products (ANZIC code 2543) and pesticides (2544) that was not previously possible. This makes joint analysis of R&D and production data more compatible but it has the disadvantage that it provides only one observation (2000/01). This section places the pharmaceutical industry within the context of Australian manufacturing and look at the historical development of the industry since 1970. We begin with Australian data as documented in official ABS publications. First we examine value-added data. For comparison purposes, we draw on ABS (8221) based on establishments units. Table 9 summarises the evidence. Value added in the pharmaceutical industry is relatively small but its growth rate has been much greater than the average for manufacturing in the late 1990s. Next we look at the BERD track record for various Australian industries for the period 1995/96 to 2000/01. Given that total BERD in Australia is known to have consistently declined until 1999/00 and recovered in 2000/01, we look at BERD growth rates for two separate periods.  Figure 17 shows that BERD has declined in absolute terms over the period 1995/96 -1999/00. The decline was particularly acute for manufacturing with a growth rate of -5.1%. The sectors most responsible for this decline are food/beverage/tobacco, wood/paper, metals and non-metallic minerals. Despite this adverse trend, the manufacturing industry stands out with the highest growth rate of 9.9%. The pattern is almost identical in the full period to 2000/01. Next, we explore ABS investment data. An important component of gross investment is capital expenditure on plant, machinery and equipment. Figure 18 depicts growth rates for real private capital expenditure for the period 1995/96-1999/01 using management unit data. 13 Again gross investment on plant, machinery and equipment in the pharmaceutical industry has grown faster than all broad manufacturing sectors. In terms of net investment, however, there has been a minor contribution by the industry. This is mainly attributed to a 78% decline in intangible assets expenditure in 1998/99 (i.e., computer software, patents and licences).    1970 1973 1976 1979 1982 1985 1988 1991 1994 1997 Figure 19 confirms the view that the pharmaceutical industry has steadily strengthened its position within manufacturing; the upward trend in BERD, production and export shares mainly begins in the late 1980s and is particularly strong in the late 1990s. As noted earlier, the latter also reflects the sharp decline in manufacturing. Worth mentioning is the fact that the industry's BERD share has been much higher than its production/value added share that suggests that Australia's innovation output and/or commercialisation capacity are below potential. Last, we compare Australia with OECD. 15 Figure 20-21 depict Australia's share in OECD pharmaceuticals based on R&D, production, added value and exports. Figure 20 points to three distinct periods: (a) a low BERD, high value added era with the latter in a negative trend in the 1980s, a declining value-added share against a rising R&D share in the late 1980s, and a convergence of the two series in the 1990s. Note also, the strong BERD performance of the industry within Australia is not comparable to that witnessed within the context OECD in the late 1990s. On the other hand, Australia's improved exports performance observed above is also apparent within OECD: a 1.7% share in 2000 from 0.6% in 1980 (figure 21). Finally, at the expense of the UK and the USA, France and Germany have both strengthened their position in international trade. Finally, the share of all five of the above countries has declined overtime with only Denmark and Sweden increasing their combined share to 16% in 2000, compared to 8.4% in 1980. In summary, the Australian industry is small relatively to other OECD countries but it has recorded strong growth in BERD, value added and exports. We have also identified a pattern in the development of the industry: a high (low) but declining value-added (BERD) share in the 1970s and early 1980s and a convergence in the 1990s.   1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 France (bottom) Germany USA (middle) UK Australia (top)"}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "This paper has examined recent trends in the global pharmaceutical industry with emphasis on production, international trade and R&D expenditure. Our focus has been on international comparisons and the distribution of business activity within OECD. The evidence here makes it clear that the pharmaceutical industry has evolved into a highly dynamic sector within the global economy. The industry has witnessed fast growth, has been a leader in BERD, offers quality jobs and is highly profitable. However, the evidence provided here is not fully consistent with the view that R&D and production in pharmaceuticals is increasingly concentrated in the USA. More accurately, we find that BERD and production are increasingly concentrated in a few centres of excellence and this confirms recent OECD evidence by Reger (1998). The pharmaceutical industry in Australia has also made substantial progress. It has seen substantial growth in capital expenditure and has raised its R&D profile. Further, it offers the most highly paid jobs in Australian manufacturing and the fastest employment growth in the OECD. It also faces some challenges. In terms of valued-added and job creation, the industry has made little progress in the last five years of the 20 th century. When compared to other OECD countries, Australia's performance is found to be below average. Although it has grown rapidly, its R&D intensity hardly compares with that of other OECD countries. In conclusion, it seems Australia ought to improve its performance in high technology sectors, if it is to remain an important player in the global innovation game. The pharmaceutical industry has become one of the most innovative industries in the world. Thus, Australia has a lot to gain in placing a higher priority on the development of the industry. Production/Value-added/Exports OECD STAN 2002 was used for most countries. For Australia, OECD STAN 1995 and 1998 (ISIC Rev 2) provide data for production and exports for the period 1970-79. Value added data come from the same source for 1973-92 but we draw on unpublished ABS data for 1998-2000. The gap in the data was filled on the assumption that there is a linear convergence in the (value added-production) ratio from 1992 to 1998. The production series for Germany was spliced as above while value added and exports come exclusively from STAN 1998. We note also that data for Belgium, France and Spain was converted to national currency (initially in 1999 Euro) using Eurostat (2000). The exchange rates were 40.62, 6.601 and 167.2 respectively."}, {"section_title": "Extrapolated Data", "text": "For countries with data gaps, all of the above series are linearly extrapolated on the assumption of a rate of change equal to the average over the last 3 years.
