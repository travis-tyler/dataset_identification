[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "This study is a longitudinal look at the different mathematics placement profiles of Black students and White students from late elementary school through 8th grade. In particular, this study utilizes the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Class of 1998-1999 (ECLS-K) data set to analyze the impact of teacher evaluation of student performance versus student demonstrated performance on the odds of being placed into algebra in the 8th grade. Results revealed that Black students had reduced odds of being placed in algebra by the time they entered 8th grade even after controlling for performance in mathematics. In addition, teacher evaluations of student performance were shown to play a greater role, albeit adversely, for Black students than for their peers. These results are discussed in terms of both implicit theory research and critical race theory. An important implication of this study is that placement recommendations must be monitored to ensure high-achieving students are placed appropriately, regardless of racial background."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "In this study we looked at why tracking students in mathematics classes \"disproportionately affects minority . . . students irrespective of prior achievements\" (Stiff, Johnson, & Akos, 2011, p. 65) and considered whether issues of racial inequity in the United States may be countered, in part, by simply making student placements in middle grades according to their elementary school performance data. We were interested in expanding on research that investigated whether differences in placement profiles were evident for Black students (Battey, 2013; Moses & Cobb, 2001; Oakes, 1990) , especially if Black students were high achieving (Berry, 2008; Stiff & Harvey, 1988; . Specifically, we investigated how elementary teacher evaluations of student performance in mathematics and demonstrated student performance in mathematics predict eighth-grade placement in algebra per students' racial background.\nWe do not argue that mathematics placements based on performance tests are superior to teacher evaluations of student performance. In fact, there is evidence that both methods of placement are vulnerable to misinterpretation and can be unreliable in evaluating student performance (Morgan & Watson, 2002) . Instead, in this study we investigated how student performance data and teacher evaluations influence mathematics placement outcomes for different groups of students"}, {"section_title": "Studying Influences of Tracking: Fifth Grade Through Eighth Grade", "text": "This study was designed to update and extend our understanding of race and student placements in eighth-grade mathematics by focusing on the longitudinal effects of teacher evaluations and students' mathematics performance on placement outcomes. We intentionally examined these issues during the critical years from upper elementary school through middle school.\nAddressing course-taking patterns in high school is difficult to achieve once a student is actually in high school (Burris, Heubert, & Levin, 2004) . Indeed, high school course trajectories are greatly influenced by course-taking patterns in middle school, which are, in turn, influenced specifically by sixth-grade mathematics placements (Akos, Lambie, Milsom, & Gilbert, 2007; Akos, Shoffner, & Ellis, 2007; Dauber, Alexander, & Entwistle, 1996; . It has been long established that the level of placement in middle school mathematics classes is a very strong determinate for how a student will be placed in high school mathematics courses (Burris et al., 2004; Burris, Heubert, & Levin, 2006; Catsambis, 1994; Dauber et al., 1996; Gamoran & Mare, 1989; Geiser & Santelices, 2006; Hallinan, 2003; Oakes, 1990) . Moreover, it has been suggested that elementary school teachers may play a critical, albeit hidden, role in middle school placement decisions (Dauber et al., 1996) . This study addressed teacher evaluations at the elementary level because the juncture between elementary school and middle school has been identified as a critical time for making course placement decisions (Akos, Shoffner, et al., 2007; Dauber et al., 1996; . It is not an exaggeration to say that high school success in mathematics, college success, and consequent career paths (Battey, 2013; Trusty, 2004) are, in part, by-products of mathematics placement decisions made for 11-year-olds as they enter sixth grade. It is important to tease out factors that affect whether students are equitably placed into the most appropriate middle school mathematics courses, as determined by the complex interplay between students' performance and their teachers' evaluations of that performance. Many factors are involved in students' mathematics placements from fifth to sixth grade (Dauber et al., 1996; Useem, 1992) . Fifth-grade teacher recommendations appear to play a significant role in the placement process. Akos, Shoffner, and Ellis (2007) documented that in a large southeastern school district, teacher recommendations were a key component of placement decisions. Parents surveyed in that study identified teacher recommendations as the most important determinant of course placement for their children. Specifically, 89% of parents named teacher recommendations as the key placement factor, 64% named test scores, 26% named administrative decision, 21% named parent preference, and fewer than 5% named other factors such as grades."}, {"section_title": "Teacher Evaluations, Mathematics, and Race", "text": "The idea that teachers, by virtue of their judgments and expectations about students, may have an impact on student performance is not a new issue. In the 1960s, research about teacher expectations and self-fulfilling prophecies, such as the work of Rosenthal and Jacobson (1968) on the Pygmalion effect, generated interest in how teacher expectations about their students might affect student performance. In a review of the subsequent two decades of research on teacher expectation effects, Good (1987) defined teacher expectations as \"inferences that teachers make about the future behavior or academic achievement of their students, based on what they know about these students now\" (p. 32). Good characterized the body of research on teachers' expectation effects as leading to a consensus that they \"can and sometimes do affect teacher-student interaction and student outcomes\" (p. 33). A later meta-analysis of teacher expectation and selffulfilling prophecies concluded that teacher expectation effects do occur but that the effects are consistently reported to be small (Jussim & Harber, 2005) .\nAlthough the overall effects of teacher judgments about students appear to be small, there is evidence that they do seem to have a racial bias that likely affects Black students differently than it does other students. In fact, Jussim, Eccles, and Madon (1996) found that teacher expectations had a larger impact on Black students than on their White peers, even when controlling for socioeconomic status. More recent examples of this line of research include a study that found that White teachers had lowered expectations for their Black students' performance on standardized tests (Oates, 2003) and that informal teacher talk about students of color was dominated by deficit-based themes (Pollack, 2013) .\nIt has become clear over the years that teacher expectations and impressions about students, although not fully understood, are a part of students' experiences and contexts for learning. The need to understand the context of students' learning of mathematics was clearly stated by Schoenfeld (1992) :\nMy own bias is that the key to this problem lies in the study of enculturation (and socialization). . . . And if we are to understand how people develop in their mathematical perspective, we must look at the issue in terms of the mathematical communities in which students live and the practices that underlie those communities [emphasis added]. (p. 364) In our research, we expand the definition of practices to include teacher evaluation of student performance that may affect teacher expectations and recommendations regarding a student's place in the greater mathematical communities found within the school. This expanded definition is in keeping with the knowledge that in the United States, teachers determine classroom cultures and \"learning opportunities are ultimately shaped into real opportunities by what goes on in the classroom\" (Schmidt & McKnight, 2012, pp. 68-69) . That is to say, it is in the hands of teachers that \"issues of equity in content coverage finally play out\" (p. 69).\nAlthough it has been noted that there is not a large body of work addressing the questions concerning the relationships among Black students, mathematics, and teacher impressions (Martin, 2012; Oates, 2003) , recent efforts to understand the effect of teacher evaluations on Black student performance are emerging. A qualitative case study of eight high-achieving Black male elementary students found that more than half of these students were disadvantaged by lower mathematics placements than their performance would have predicted (Berry, 2008) . A large quantitative study put teacher perception at the center of analysis and then compared students in racially congruent (same race student and teacher) and incongruent classroom conditions. The researcher concluded that Black students are vulnerable to lowered test scores when placed in the classrooms of White teachers and that this may be attributable to White teachers' lowered perceptions of their Black students' academic ability (Oates, 2003) .\nIn a call to increase research regarding Black students and their experience in mathematics, Martin (2012) argued specifically for papers that look at the complex relationships that influence Black students' learning in mathematics. This call included exploring school-based issues, such as course placements, discipline referrals, and academic support referrals, that may become intertwined with definitions of Blackness and may affect teachers' evaluation of student competencies and consequent access to rich learning opportunities (Martin, 2012) . Stinson (2007) argued for an emphasis on the achievement of Black students over a deficit model as the issues of student performance in mathematics are studied. Along these lines, we aim to add to work that explores these issues by investigating the relative role of teacher evaluations of student performance and students' demonstrated performance for Black versus White students as well as for Black students who have demonstrated a high level of achievement."}, {"section_title": "Current Study", "text": "Our investigation was a secondary analysis of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Class of 1998-1999 (ECLS-K) national database. The ECLS-K followed students from kindergarten through the eighth grade. The initial kindergarten sample was nationally representative and included 21,260 children throughout the country. The ECLS-K database includes extensive student, family, teacher, and school level data such as student background characteristics in the home, teacher credentials and evaluations of students, and school demographic data. Data for this study were drawn from the third grade (student mathematics performance scores), fifth grade (student mathematics performance scores and teacher evaluation of student performance), and eighth grade (student mathematics course placement). These rounds of data were collected in 2002, 2004, and 2007, respectively . The key research questions of this study were:\n1. How does fifth-grade teacher evaluation of student ability predict placement in algebra for White students versus Black students? 2. How does fifth-grade teacher evaluation of student ability predict placement in algebra for high-performing students?"}, {"section_title": "Conceptual Framework", "text": "Perceptual bias and implicit beliefs. A distinction has been made in the psychological literature between teacher expectations that lead to a self-fulfilling prophecy and those that have an impact on teachers' perceptual bias (Jussim, Madon, & Chatman, 1994) . A self-fulfilling prophecy occurs when a teacher's beliefs have a direct impact on students' performance, whereas a perceptual bias is found when a teacher's beliefs have an impact on the teacher's own evaluation of a student. This perceptual bias may or may not have an impact on student performance.\nImplicit Theory Research holds that contemporary issues surrounding decision making in general (Kahneman, 2011) and race in particular (Banaji & Greenwald, 2013) are less likely to be conscious decisions and are more likely subconscious decisions, of which the decision maker is unaware. Consistent with Implicit Theory Research, we do not argue that any findings regarding teachers' evaluations of students are a conscious decision to subordinate student abilities in accordance with racial prejudice but instead are likely driven by implicit beliefs about students.\nThe current study utilizes the perceptual bias framework (Figure 1 ) to understand possible indirect and longitudinal effects upon students. This basic construct is Figure 1 . Conceptual framework: implicit belief, perceptual bias, and teacher evaluation of student mathematical abilities. To the left is a basic rendering of the perceptual bias construct outlined in Jussim, Madon, and Chatman (1994) . The boxes with dotted lines represent the theoretical idea presented here that beliefs and expectations of teachers may affect teacher recommendations that then have an impact on actual student placements in courses. It has been established that placement does affect outcomes. To the right is our adaptation of that basic construct for this study that includes the idea that teacher beliefs are not necessarily conscious but are instead implicit. The grey boxes represent our specific areas of analysis. rendered on the left of Figure 1 ; the dashed box indicates a theoretical link between the established impact of perceptual bias on the evaluation of the student and the teacher's recommendations regarding student placement. In this study we included the idea that teacher beliefs and expectations are implicit, as described above ( Figure  1 , right-hand side). We specifically investigated whether teacher evaluations of students, as measured by their evaluation of the students' mathematical performance, might demonstrate a different relationship to Black students versus White students (see grey boxes, Figure 1 ). Because it has been determined that the mathematics courses students complete in middle school influence high school and postsecondary outcomes, our conceptual framework is designed to investigate the possible link between elementary school teacher evaluation of student performance and eventual outcomes in mathematics as set in motion by middle school mathematics placements.\nWhy high-performing Black students? As part of the study, data collected on high-performing students were examined to determine whether these students were placed into courses in a manner consistent with teacher evaluation of student performance or consistent with students' demonstrated mathematics performance. Our rationale for isolating high-performing students is multifaceted. Initially, it rests on explicating the nature of the complex realities surrounding the extent to which U.S. students from different ethno-racial backgrounds are afforded the opportunity to study higher mathematics. As a collective subpopulation, Black students in the United States are commonly characterized and perceived as low performing in mathematics (Pollack, 2013; Stinson, 2007) . Indeed, a plethora of scholarly and popular literature delineates challenges of enhancing the mathematics proficiency of Black students (see Chubb & Loveless, 2002; Paige & Witty, 2010; Thernstrom & Thernstrom, 2003) . Our goal was to avoid the problematic framework that implies that White student performance is inherently superior and thereby normative (Martin, 2012; Singham, 2005) and that the primary issue in closing the achievement gap is to raise the achievement of Black students to the level of their White peers (Berry, 2008; Stinson, 2007) . Thus, our focus on highperforming Black students allows us to offer a fuller image of these students' experiences in the context of mathematics study.\nSecond, we seek to illuminate the situation facing Black youngsters who, through performance-based indications of their abilities in third and fifth grade, would appear to be qualified candidates to receive teacher recommendations for placement on a course trajectory that would afford them the opportunity to study higher level mathematics (in this case, algebra) in middle school. By focusing on high-performing students, we were also permitted to control for particular key elements (e.g., low student efficacy as suggested by low achievement scores) that undoubtedly affect teacher evaluations of student ability as well as teachers' subsequent recommendations for student placements in mathematics courses beyond the fifth grade. This focus is in keeping with Martin's (2012) call for studies that help us better understand the experiences of Black students at the midlevel of the classroom, as opposed to the macrolevel of state and national trends or the microlevel of individual experiences and results (Martin, 2012) . Finally, it occurred to us that by focusing on teacher evaluation and eventual placement of high-performing students, the potential for an actionable way to, at least partially, address inequity within a school setting may present itself. The overall performance of Black students may be enhanced simply by placing students, as they exit elementary school, in middle grades classes according to demonstrated performance. Because of the persistent racialized descriptions of the achievement gap (wherein Black students are characterized as a monolithic low-performing collective), this solution-placing students according to their performance-may seem immediately counterintuitive. To the contrary, extant research has demonstrated that high-performing Black students are frequently overlooked and tracked into low-level mathematics courses based on these students' demographic characteristics ; in this case, the characteristic is race."}, {"section_title": "Method Sample", "text": "The initial sample size of the ECLS-K study was over 20,000 students. Through attrition, the sample size was reduced to 11,260 students by fifth grade. The ECLS-K data collection protocol mandated that mathematics performance data be collected for approximately half of these students (N = 5,339). For the current analysis, data indicating the eighth-grade placement of the students were also needed, and this information was gathered from the teacher questionnaires at the eighth-grade level (N = 4,449). The current study also eliminated students from schools that either required algebra or did not offer algebra, because we assumed that schoolwide policy, rather than teacher evaluation or student performance, would be the mechanism in place for deciding student course placement. Therefore, students were included only from schools where some eighth-grade students did take algebra while others did not. After these adjustments, the sample size at the eighth grade became 3,055."}, {"section_title": "Instruments", "text": "The relationships among teacher evaluation, student mathematics performance, demographic data, and eighth-grade mathematics placement were investigated. Independent variables used in the ECLS-K study included the average performance across assessments of student mathematical performance at the third and fifth grades (Math Performance) and fifth-grade teacher ratings of the mathematical performance of these same students (Teacher Evaluation). Evaluations by fifth-grade teachers were used because, as discussed above, these teachers play a significant role in making recommendations for the placement into the critical first year of middle school (Grade 6). The mathematics performance scores in both third and fifth grade were utilized in order to capture the students' performance over the course of their late elementary years and to create a more stable performance indicator (two data points averaged rather than one data point alone).\nTeacher evaluation. The Teacher Academic Rating Scales (TARS) in mathematics are a variable housed within the ECLS-K data set. These scales were completed by teachers for individual students and represent a detailed measure of the teachers' understanding of each student's mathematical ability level at a given grade level (see sample questions used in the TARS, Figure 2 ). The TARS was constructed for the ECLS-K by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) to align with prior research about skills that predict later achievement and also to clearly link with current curricular standards (Pollack, Atkins-Burnett, Najarian, & Rock, 2005) . Throughout this study, we use the fifth-grade TARS directly as a proxy for the teacher's evaluation of a student and simply rename the variable \"Teacher Evaluation\" for the purpose of making the function of the TARS clear within this analysis.\nMathematics performance. Student mathematics performance was assessed using achievement tests designed by the NCES for the ECLS-K data set to measure student performance level and growth in mathematics and to assess skills that are typically taught and considered developmentally important at a given grade level. Because no assessments were available at the time that met the specific needs of a longitudinal study of its nature, assessments were constructed specifically for the ECLS-K and included items from commercial measures of mathematics as well as items that had been released from NCES studies (Pollack et al., 2005) . Standards from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and the National Academy of Science (Pollack et al., 2005) as well as the scope and sequence of documents from state assessments were taken into consideration in constructing the assessments.\nGiven the emphasis on longitudinal trends, the ECLS-K mathematics assessment was built around an Item Response Theory (IRT) model. All raw scores were converted to IRT scale scores, which are given in standard deviation units (Pollack et al., 2005) . By using IRT in testing, scores from different batteries of tests can be compared. In equating test scores, evaluators can examine growth (i.e., changes in ability) due to interventions (Hill & Lubienski, 2007) . Items with r-biserials of .40 or higher were the standard for the assessment (Pollack et al., 2005) . Consistent with research practices, a small number of items were also included that fell below this standard if they were useful in capturing other important information and creating an acceptable number of administered items (Pollack et al., 2005) . The exact items used for the cognitive assessment have not been released to the public."}, {"section_title": "Preparation of Data", "text": "The Math Performance variable and Teacher Evaluation (TARS) variable initially had different quantitative scales in the ECLS-K data set. For this study these variables were standardized to allow for direct comparison of effects (King, 2008) . Specifically, we transformed both the Math Performance and the Teacher Evaluation variables into z-scores. Both variables were normally distributed, so no transformations were needed to further prepare the data for analysis.\nCircle one for each titem. Because the goal of this study was to understand how students are placed in mathematics classes in relation to teacher evaluation and their mathematical performance, all students were analyzed to determine general placement profiles. As discussed earlier, high performers were also analyzed. A high-performing group serves to create a contrast between potentially low expectations (Teacher Evaluation) and demonstrated student ability (Math Performance). Therefore, a group of High Performing Students was created. These students scored between the 70th and 99th percentile in third grade, in fifth grade, or in both third and fifth grade. This group was created to capture the placement patterns for students whose demonstrated performance was consistent with potential placement in algebra by eighth grade.\nThe category cutoff for High Performing is based on documentation indicating that approximately 35% of students in the United States take algebra or above at the eighthgrade level (Loveless, 2008) . This implies that those performing at approximately the 70th percentile or above at some point in late elementary school are potential candidates for advanced placement mathematics in middle school, and algebra by eighth grade, if placement is made according to demonstrated performance."}, {"section_title": "Analysis and Controls", "text": "The independent variables in this study are Math Performance and Teacher Evaluation; the dependent variable of interest was student placement in algebra or above by eighth grade. Placement decisions were recorded as placed in algebra (yes) or not placed in algebra (no). Logistic regression is appropriate for use in studies where the dependent variable is an either-or situation such as in the current study.\nIn logistic regression, controls are put in place to ensure comparisons of students with comparable background characteristics. When analyzing odds of placement for Black and White students, we controlled for socioeconomic status (SES), receipt of special education services, gender, Math Performance, and Teacher Evaluation. Regarding SES, a composite scale score was provided within the ECLS-K for each student based on socioeconomic indicators of both prestige and wealth. These indicators are: father/male guardian's education, mother/female guardian's education, father/male guardian's occupation, mother/female guardian's occupation, and household income. This composite socioeconomic variable was utilized as the SES covariate. Receipt of special education services was determined through variables within the ECLS-K (F5SPECS and F6SPECS) that indicated whether or not a student had an Individualized Education Plan (IEP) in place during the third-and fifth-grade rounds of data collection.\nLogistic regression utilizes the logarithm of odds to produce the regression coefficient variable (B ), also called the logit. Just as with linear regression, a coefficient variable B with a value near 0 indicates that the variable is not significant. The variable B (the slope) indicates how much the dependent variable changes in relation to a given independent variable. In this study, for instance, when looking at placement odds for a student who is Black, variable B is interpreted as follows: If a student is Black, his or her log odds of placement is affected by a factor of B (while 1 A one-unit change in this analysis is a standard deviation change of 1 because our variables have been transformed into z-scores.\nholding other variables constant). This statistic, then, provides an indicator of the odds one has of being placed in algebra per a given background characteristic. Because it is the logarithm of the odds, however, it can be difficult to interpret; therefore, the odds ratio is generally preferred for interpretation (King, 2008) .\nLogistic regression also yields a comparative statistic: the Exponentiation of B, also known as the odds ratio (OR ). This provides an effect size. Effect sizes are, in general, reported to relay the substantive significance of a result as opposed to the purely statistical significance of a result. In this analysis, the effect size conveys how much a one-unit change 1 in an independent variable affects the odds of placement in algebra by eighth grade. So if we are looking at the Math Performance variable we read the OR as follows: A one-unit change in Math Performance predicts the odds of placement for this group of students by a factor of the OR value compared to the comparative group. An OR of 2 for Math Performance, for instance, would mean that a standard deviation change of 1 in a student's Math Performance doubles the predicted odds of placement for a student of that group compared to the comparative group.\nFor the purpose of generating the OR statistic, when using race as a predictor, dummy variables were created using the group of White students as the comparative group. An OR < 1 would indicate that Black students have smaller odds than their typical White peers of being placed in algebra, as determined by the controls outlined above.\nIn order to maximize the ability to make inferences about the eighth-grade sample, weights were applied for this analysis to account for both the attrition of students by the eighth grade round of data and to account for the specific selection of students determined by the conditions of this study (National Center for Education Statistics, 2009)."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Descriptive Statistics", "text": "Overall, in this study, 43% of the sample students were placed in algebra, and 68% of High Performing students were placed in algebra (Table 1) ."}, {"section_title": "Correlational Analyses", "text": "Correlational analyses of the data set revealed moderately strong correlations between teacher evaluation of student performance in mathematics and students' demonstrated mathematics performance scores in the fifth grade (r = .64, p < .001). In addition, both teacher evaluation of student performance and students' mathematics performance showed a moderate relationship to student placement in eighth-grade mathematics (Teacher Evaluation, r = .44, p < .001; Math Performance, r = .49, p < .001). (10) 68 (5) 47 (4) a N = 3,055 with 139 students missing race data. This yields an N of 2,916 for analysis including race.\nCorrelations between fifth-grade teacher evaluation and mathematics performance for students in different racial categories and students with an IEP were also analyzed to determine if teacher evaluations were accurate for certain subsets of students (Table 2) . Correlations between fifth-grade teacher evaluation and fifth-grade student mathematics performance were consistently found to be moderately strong across racial subsets and for students with IEPs and in line with the correlation found for all students. "}, {"section_title": "Logistic Regression Analyses", "text": "White students. For White students, the odds of being placed in algebra are favorable when compared to their comparatively typical Black peers (OR = 1.48, p = .007). For White students, Math Performance is a stronger predictor of placement than is Teacher Evaluation. In terms of the odds ratios, a 1.0 SD increase in Math Performance increases the odds of placement by a factor of 3.05 (B = 1.11; OR = 3.05, p < .001). A 1.0 SD increase in Teacher Evaluation increases the odds of placement by a factor of 1.51 (B = .41; OR = 1.51, p < .001).\nAn interaction was found between Math Performance and Teacher Evaluation that indicated the statistics reported above are mitigated by an internal difference within the data. The interaction indicates that Teacher Evaluation was a more powerful predictor of placement for higher performing White students than for lower performing White students. For low-performing White students, placement outcomes were virtually the same, regardless of Teacher Evaluation. As mathematics performance increased, the impact of Teacher Evaluation on student placement increased. For students who were rated low by the fifth-grade teacher, the interaction trend line indicates that student placement in eighth-grade algebra was suppressed, even in the presence of high Math Performance. These trends can be visualized with an interaction chart that helps us interpret the flow of the data by charting what would happen when a student has extremely high or extremely low Math Performance or Teacher Evaluation scores (Figure 3 ). Figure 3 . Graphic representation of trends within the data for White students. The interaction in the data between Teacher Evaluation (rate) and Math Performance (math) indicates that for White students, a low teacher evaluation reduces odds of placement disproportionately for high-performing students compared to low-performing students.\nReference points for Log-Odds: -2 or lower \u2248 1% chance of placement; -1 \u2248 10% chance; 0 \u2248 50% chance; +1 \u2248 90% chance; +2 or higher \u2248 99% chance.\nHere we use the coefficients and the constant term, as we would in multiple linear regression, to create an equation that accounts for the unique effect of each variable. This allows us to analyze what happens when a student receives extremely high or low Math Performance scores or Teacher Evaluation ratings as compared to his or her average performing same-group peer. To capture the extreme range of our data, we look at theoretical scores that are 2 standard deviations above and 2 standard deviations below the norm. Although the extreme data points used for analysis may not represent actual student data points, the slopes of the line were determined by the actual data and therefore help us to understand trends. We calculated a logit score for each condition (2 SD above the mean for Teacher Evaluation-High Rate; 2 SD below the mean for Teacher Evaluation-Low Rate; 2 SD above the mean for Math Performance-High Math; 2 SD below the mean for Math Performance-Low Math). The y-axis component of each point is the overall impact of the variables on placement outcomes and is reported in logits. Therefore a 0 indicates a 50% chance of Placement in Algebra by eighth grade compared to the average-rated and averageperforming peer. Values below 0 indicate a less than 50% chance and values above 0 a greater than 50% chance of placement compared to the average peer.\nConsistent with the fact that we have a significant interaction term, we see that the impact of Teacher Evaluation is different across the spectrum of different possible Math Performance scores for White students. Teacher Evaluation as a predictor affects the odds of placement less for low-scoring students than for higher performing students. For high-performing students, a low rating affects prediction odds from a logit of positive 2 (approximately 99% chance of placement) to a logit of -1 (approximately 10% chance of placement) with the low rating.\nBlack students. Black students have reduced odds of placement in algebra by the eighth grade compared to their peers. Using Black as a predictor, a student who is Black has an OR of .68, meaning an odds of placement that is approximately two-thirds that of his or her White peers when controlling for other factors (B = -.39; OR = .68, p = .007).\nBoth Teacher Evaluation (B = .40, p = .036) and Math Performance (B = .66, p = .001) were significant predictors of mathematics placement for Black students, and there was no interaction between Teacher Evaluation and Math Performance for these students (Table 3) . Again using a chart to plot extreme conditions to understand the trends in the data, we see that unlike White students, Black students who have a theoretically high mathematics performance score and a high teacher rating do not have excellent prediction odds of being placed in algebra (Figure 4) . If a Black student has both high Teacher Evaluation and a high Math Performance, the trends in the data indicate that the student has essentially the same odds of algebra placement as Black students who have average mathematics scores and average teacher ratings. We infer this from the fact that the regression formula yields a logit of 0, which is interpreted as a 50% chance of being placed compared to average performing Black students (Figure 4) . Conversely, White students with high Teacher Evaluation and high Math Performance have dramatically increased prediction odds (Figure 3 ) of placement in algebra by eighth grade compared to their average-performing White peers. Furthermore, Black students who are high performing but have a low Teacher Evaluation rating (Figure 4 ) have prediction odds of one-tenth the rate of placement for their average-performing and average-rated Black peers.

This is a highly significant result and a more severe reduction in odds than for the group of all Black students as reported above.\nFinally, comparisons of both the regression coefficients (B ) and the ORs indicate that Math Performance was consistently a more powerful positive predictor for White students' placement than it was for Black students (Table 4) ."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "It has been previously established that the mathematics classes students take matter. In general, students gain in overall academic achievement by virtue of a higher mathematics class placement in high school (Cahan & Linchevski, 1996; Hallinan, 2003) . Indeed, as a direct result of their study of advanced mathematics courses in high school, such students enter college with critical prerequisite knowledge and skills necessary to study disciplines and professional fields (e.g., physics, engineering, computer science) that decidedly are closed to students who were not afforded opportunities to study advanced mathematics in high school.\nAmong other factors, the tiered structure of courses, the myriad opportunities for extracurricular activity involvement, and the heterogeneous character of secondary student populations make it exceedingly difficult to isolate which factors have the greatest impact on course-taking patterns in high school. This is especially the case once a student is actually in high school (Burris et al., 2004 (Burris et al., , 2006 . Nevertheless, course-taking trajectories in mathematics are predictable because the courses students are likely to take in high school are greatly influenced by their course-taking patterns in middle school. Correspondingly, middle school patterns are influenced by the overall quality and opportunity to learn mathematics in elementary classrooms. Specifically, sixth-grade mathematics class placements can foretell later mathematics study for most students (Akos, Shoffner, et al., 2007; Dauber et al., 1996; .\nThus, to a large degree, high school and college outcomes are predictable by-products of academic decisions made for students when they are 11 years old and in the fifth or sixth grade. What has not been established is how the factors that determine this transition from elementary to middle school may affect this trajectory. The essential question raised herein is whether specific indicators, such as the fifth-grade teacher's evaluation of student mathematical ability and the demonstrated mathematical performance of that student, affect these subsequent placement outcomes differently for different groups of students. Our findings suggest that they do.\nMoreover our findings reveal that this differential impact is largely attributed to the race of the student. In this regard, Black students had lower odds of placement in algebra by the eighth grade than their White peers. Specifically, when controlling for Math Performance, Teacher Evaluation, socioeconomic status, gender, and IEP status, the odds of placement in algebra by the eighth grade for Black students were reduced by two-thirds to two-fifths compared to their White peers. For Black students, Teacher Evaluation was nearly as powerful a predictor as Math Performance. This is in sharp contrast to the general finding that Math Performance was a decidedly more accurate predictor of algebra placement than Teacher Evaluation for White students (see Table 4 ).\nOur data indicate that Teacher Evaluation was, comparatively, a more powerful predictor for mathematics placement for Black students than it was for their White peers. This supports the claim that demonstrated academic performance does not have the same impact on placement outcomes for Black students as for White students. High-performing Black students are particularly affected by this trend.\nIndeed, it appears that high performance among Black students may not be attributed to the students' own mathematics abilities in the same way it is to their White peers and does not provide the access to higher mathematics placements. Stated differently, for Black students, high performance does not overcome the impact of a low Teacher Evaluation rating vis-\u00e0-vis eighth-grade mathematics placement. Note that our data do not support the hypothesis that Teacher Evaluation would be a stronger outright predictor for Black students than for White students. In fact, the predictive power of Teacher Evaluation was the same for both groups. A summary of the patterns of placement data ( Figure 5) , specifically considering the different impact of performance, begs the question: What mitigates the impact of performance for Black students compared to their White peers?\nWe suggest here that the pattern in which Teacher Evaluation is suppressed compared to Black student performance serves as a viable and plausible explanation. Lower teacher ratings for high-performing Black students are consistent with (a) lowered rate of placement, (b) lowered impact of performance, and (c) equal impact of Teacher Evaluation. Although the data correlating Teacher Evaluation and Math Performance were consistent for White and Black students, we hold that this is consistent with suppressed evaluations for Black students, so long as the evaluations for White students are likewise favorable compared to performance. Again, this is consistent with the need to explain why Teacher Evaluation scores are stable across races but high performance is not \"recognized\" in the placement profile of Black students. "}, {"section_title": "Considering Alternative Explanations", "text": "Here we draw a conclusion that high-performing Black students are not gaining equitable access to algebra class by the eighth grade based on analysis of a national data set. We further conclude that race is a factor in this trend and suggest that teacher evaluation of Black students may play a role in the racialized nature of these patterns. It is critical to note that there are other possible explanations, and we hope that this paper will open up conversations about these possibilities as well as the ones suggested here. For instance, our study does not rule out the possibility that high-performing Black students are not gaining access because of institutionalized issues within the school. Although our study ensured that algebra was available by the eighth grade at the schools for all students that were analyzed, it could be that limited resources kept the number of these classes to a minimum in these schools. At the same time, we believe that this explanation is inconsistent with the fact that Teacher Evaluation for Black students maintained an equal impact to Teacher Evaluation for White students. If institutional barriers affected Black students by reducing access and teachers evaluated students in line with student high performance, then the impact of Teacher Evaluation would \"take a hit\" and should go down in predictive value. These institutional barriers for high-performing Black students are consistent with lowered rate of placement and lowered impact of performance. However, they are inconsistent with equal impact of Teacher Evaluation.\nIt is also possible that Black students themselves have opted out of algebra classes in spite of being recommended for them. Similarly, given our data, this explanation is inconsistent with the Teacher Evaluation variable maintaining predictive value, because students going against a high evaluation of them would, again, reduce the impact of Teacher Evaluation consistent with their high performance. High-performing Black students \"opting out\" is consistent with lowered rate of placement and lowered impact of performance. Yet, as above, it is inconsistent with equal impact of Teacher Evaluation."}, {"section_title": "Implications and Next Steps", "text": "When it comes to Black students, performance data appear to have a reduced influence on placement and teacher evaluation an enhanced influence. That is to say, even in the light of objective measures of achievement and potential, the demonstrated mathematics acumen of high-performing Black students cannot be counted on (as it does for their White peers) to differentiate them academically from lower performing same-race peers. In short, Black students confront an untenable impediment in that their Blackness (or, as we suggest here, the teachers' implicit responses to these students' Blackness) serves as an invisible, albeit formidable, obstacle to gaining access to higher level mathematics courses, irrespective of their demonstrated performance. This observation stands in contrast to the idea that lower performance drives the achievement gap in isolation. Instead, it supports the conjecture that teacher placement recommendations, based disproportionately on teacher evaluation, may also contribute to a gap in achievement for Black students.\nThe differences in placement patterns identified in this study translate into fewer opportunities for Black students to access the courses that are demonstrated to increase future academic success. And because the odds of Black students encountering this negative outcome are greater than the odds faced by their White peers, it seems evident that, to some degree, this difference is the result of teacher evaluations reflecting negative perceptions of Black students as being nonacademic in general (Oates, 2003; Pollack, 2013) and nonacademic in the study of mathematics in particular. Conversely, the more favorable odds of gaining access to advanced mathematics courses for White students can be viewed as a direct manifestation of longstanding positive perspectives surrounding Whiteness and the related privileges it affords those so classified (McIntosh, 1988) . Indeed, examined through the lens of critical race theory, findings from our study provide an especially troubling example of racialized privilege, as embodied in the notion of Whiteness as property (Harris, 1993) . The example of our findings strikes us as especially egregious because it occurs in the context of course-taking trajectories based on children's demonstrated academic performance and teacher evaluations of these students' capabilities at the fifth-grade level-a time when many of those involved (parents, students, and the teachers themselves) likely do not foresee the powerful, long-term implications of placement recommendations. The unspoken privilege of Whiteness as property manifests itself in that White children can count on their race to enhance their odds of being perceived by their teachers as capable of learning mathematics at higher levels. Ladson-Billings (2004) has described the operations of Whiteness as property vis-\u00e0-vis school curriculum and opportunity to learn. These findings support this view and the idea that the enhanced property value of Whiteness (and conversely the devaluation of Blackness) is in operation as early as elementary school.\nSchools are, almost by definition, purveyors of culture. And as purveyors of culture, they are not passive recipients of cultural norms; rather, they actively engage in and promote them. A disturbing sidebar to this reality is that without thoughtful intervention, the culture transmitted and reinforced in schools will perpetuate extant patterns similar if not identical to those found in the larger society. Findings from our study suggest some students became victims to a type of negative academic racial profiling-learning mathematics while Black, as it were. Like its counterpart in the larger society, the negative academic profiling identified in this study represents a blatant violation of a fundamental right. In this case, it is the right of all students to be assured that their demonstrated performance will serve as equal leverage toward opportunities to learn.\nWe hasten to note that although this study was not initially theoretically grounded in Critical Race Theory (CRT), the nature of our findings challenged us to examine more closely the implications in light of the racialized nature of the academic achievement gap itself. An important element of CRT is to address issues of racism, not from a position of \"color blindness,\" but through deliberate consideration of the experiences of Black and other minoritized populations. The explicit purpose is to make connections between those experiences and the color we do see. Similarly, CRT holds that Whiteness, and the privileges it affords, have become so ingrained in the fabric of U.S. institutions (including schools) that it is often invisible, unnamed, overlooked, and thereby not analyzed.\nThe obvious question at this point, the what now, needs to be addressed by the education establishment and society at large. We have identified differences in the eventual placement rates for Black and White students into algebra by eighth grade and have spotlighted how the success of Black students is being limited by undervaluing their academic performance.\nIn this case, the what now is greatly affected by the why. In the book Blindspot: Hidden Biases of Good People, Banaji and Greenwald (2013) draw the conclusion, based on evidence that is \"far too substantial to ignore\" (p. 209), that \"Implicit race attitudes (automatic race preferences) contribute to discrimination against Black Americans\" (p. 208). As an example of how to outsmart unconscious implicit assumptions, they cite the use of blind auditions for professional musicians (Banaji & Greenwald, 2013) . Although using blinded academic performance testing, without regard for the students' race or teacher evaluation of student performance, may not be as clear an answer for schools as a blind audition is for musicians, we believe there is merit to this analogy. Because of our deeply ingrained ideas about Black and White students' expected performance levels, many people may implicitly expect that a blinded practice would reduce Black student placement in higher math classes. To reiterate, although our call for teachers to assign Black students to mathematics courses based on the individual student's actual demonstrated performance strikes us as a painfully obvious solution, we acknowledge that for various reasons (not the least of which are longstanding beliefs about and acceptance of notions of Black inferiority) this solution might appear counterintuitive to many. But the findings of this study and others that have taken into consideration the experience of Black students or high-performing Black students (Berry, 2008; suggest otherwise. We believe, and our data suggest, that the achievement gap may be partially explained by this differential opportunity to learn and that there are academically high-performing black students being overlooked because of implicit assumptions made about them. In this vein, a first step for administrators and teachers who want to avoid the impact of implicit bias is to simply create a blinded spreadsheet of scores and placement recommendations. It may be that these blinded data spreadsheets line up with what teachers would have recommended for student placement. And it may be that they do not. Either way, the what now is to let the students' performance drive placement until there is clear evidence that teacher evaluations of student performance are not hindering the placement outcomes of Black students."}]
