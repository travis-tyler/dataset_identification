This is in contrast to cross-sectional studies where the response of interest is measured only once for each individual. Longitudinal studies are most appropriate for the investigation of individual changes over time and for the study of effects of aging and other factors likely to influence change.\nAs a first example, consider data from a randomized longitudinal experiment, previously described and analyzed by Verdonck et al. (1998) , in which 50 male Wistar rats were randomized to either a control group or one of the two treatment groups where treatment consisted of a low or high dose of the drug Decapeptyl, which is an inhibitor for testosterone production in rats. The primary aim of the study was to investigate the effect of the inhibition of the production of testosterone in male Wistar rats on their craniofacial growth. The treatment started at the age of 45 days, and measurements were taken every 10 days, with the first observation taken at the age of 50 days. One of the responses of interest was the height of the skull, measured as the distance (in pixels) between two well-defined points on X-ray pictures of the skull, taken after the rat has been anesthetized. The individual profiles are shown in Figure 1 . Let us give three examples.\nThis rat experiment is an example of a so-called balanced experiment, i.e., an experiment where the same number of repeated measurements is planned for all participating subjects, at fixed points in time. However, it is clear from Figure 1 that not all rats have measurements up to the age of 110 days. This is due to the fact that many rats do not survive anaesthesia and therefore drop out before the end of the study. While 50 rats have been randomized at the start of the experiment, only 22 of them survived the first 6 measurements, so measurements on only 22 rats are available in the way anticipated at the design stage. This implies that statistical models will be needed which are flexible enough to allow for an unequal number of measurements per subject. Moreover, depending on the nature of dropout, interpretational problems may arise as well. For example, suppose that rats dropping out prematurely are, in some sense, systematically different from the completers. It is then clear that correct conclusions cannot be obtained unless the dropout process is taken into account.\nAs a second example, we consider longitudinal measurement of prostate specific antigen (PSA) taken on 54 participants of the ongoing Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA, Shock et al., 1984) . The participants in the BLSA return to the National Institute on Aging's Gerontology Research Center approximately every two years for about three days of biomedical and psychological examinations. As part of the study, a longitudinal bank of frozen serum samples has been maintained for over 25 years. This unique source of information provided serial measurements of PSA levels and allowed Pearson et al. (1994) to set up a retrospective case-control study where repeated PSA measurements could be related to prostate disease. Eighteen of 54 selected BLSA participants were identified as prostate cancer cases (4 of them being metastatic cancer cases), 20 participants had benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and there were 16 controls with no clinical sign of prostate Figure 1 Rat data. Individual profiles for each of the treatment groups in the rat experiment separately disease. A graphical representation of the data is shown in Figure 2 . Obviously, this data set is highly unbalanced in the sense that an unequal number of measurements is available for each subject, and measurements are taken at completely arbitrary time points.\nAs a third example, which will be employed to illustrate missing data issues, we consider data from a breast cancer study. This study was an open-label, multicenter, parallel group design conducted at 67 North American centers. Patients were randomized to either the new drug Vorozole (2.5 mg taken once daily) or the standard drug Megestrol Acetate (40 mg four times daily). The patient population consisted of postmenopausal patients with histologically confirmed estrogen-receptor positive metastatic breast carcinoma. All 452 randomized patients were followed until disease progression or death. The main objective was to compare the treatment groups with respect to response rate, whereas secondary objectives included a comparison relative to duration of response, time to progression, survival, safety, pain relief, performance status, and quality of life. Full details of this study are reported in Goss et al. (1999) . In this paper, we will focus on overall quality of life, measured by the total Functional Living Index: Cancer (FLIC; Schipper et al., 1984) . In this, a higher FLIC score is the more desirable outcome. Even though this outcome is, strictly speaking, of the ordinal type, the total number of categories encountered exceeds 70, justifying the use of continuousoutcome methods. Patients underwent screening and for those deemed eligible, a detailed examination at baseline (occasion 0) took place. Further measurement occasions were months 1, then from months 2 at bimonthly intervals until month 44. Goss et al. (1999) analyzed FLIC using a two-way ANOVA model with effects for treatment, disease status, as well as their interaction. No significant difference was found. Apart from treatment, important covariates are dominant site of the disease as well as clinical stage.\nThe examples illustrate that the analysis of longitudinal data requires statistical models which allow the number of repeated measurements as well as the time intervals between these measurements to vary among individuals. Further, correct inferences can only be obtained by taking into account the correlation between repeated measurements within subjects, which is often a decreasing function of the time span between those measurements. One possible class of models are linear mixed models, which assume that the vector y i of response values for the ith subject satisfy a linear regression model\nwhere b contains population-specific parameters describing average trends, where b i contains subject-specific parameters describing how the evolution of the ith subject deviates from the average evolution in the population, and where \u00ab i is a vector containing the usual error components. The aim of this paper is to summarize how inferences based on linear mixed models can be obtained, to review some of the advantages as well as drawbacks, and to give some general guidelines for the practising statistician confronted with the analysis of longitudinal data. We will focus on model formulation, inference, interpretation, as well as on the important problem of how to take into account the fact that not all data may be present as planned in the original design of the study.\nSection 2 introduces the linear mixed model. Inference for the marginal model and for the random effects is discussed in Sections 3 and 4, respectively. General missing data issues is the topic of Section 5. Selection models, pattern-mixture models and sensitivity analysis is treated in Sections 6-8. Some remarks on computation and software are offered in Section 9."}, {"section_title": "The linear mixed model", "text": "Let y i \u00bc \u00f0y i1 ; . . . ; y in i \u00de 0 denote the vector of repeated measurements for subject i. We reconsider the general model\nin which b is a vector of population-average regression coefficients called fixed effects, and where b i is a vector of subject-specific regression coefficients. The b i describe how the evolution of the ith subject deviates from the average evolution in the population. The matrices X i and Z i are \u00f0n i \u00c2 p\u00de and \u00f0n i \u00c2 q\u00de matrices of known covariates. The residual components \u00ab i are assumed to be independent N\u00f00; S i \u00de, where S i depends on i only through its dimension n i . Note that inferences for b, all b i and the covariance parameter(s) in the S i cannot be obtained from simple maximum likelihood estimation based on the above model. Indeed, Neyman and Scott (1948) showed that, as the number of parameters increases with the sample size N, classical maximum likelihood (ML) estimates may be inconsistent. See also Breslow and Day (1989, section 7 .1) for an example in a different context. A first alternative is to treat the subject-specific parameters b i as nuisance and to derive inferences for the remaining parameters from the conditional likelihood of the data y i , conditional on sufficient statistics for the b i . However, as shown by Verbeke et al. (2001b) , information may get lost about some of the parameters of interest in b. See also Diggle et al. (1994, section 9. 3) for an example in the context of logistic regression. An additional disadvantage of this approach is that all information is lost about the subject-specific effects b i as well.\nA second alternative, which is the approach followed in this paper, is to assume the subject-specific regression parameters to be independent random variables with common distribution function Q\u00f0b i \u00de, called the mixing distribution. The b i are then termed random effects, and inference for b, all S i as well as Q is based on the marginal likelihood of the data y i , obtained from integrating out the random effects. It follows from the classical maximum likelihood theory that, if Q is assumed to belong to some parametric family of distributions (i.e., a set of distributions indexed by a finite number of parameters), all parameter estimators are consistent and asymptotically normally distributed. However, it is also possible not to make any assumptions about the mixing distribution, and to estimate Q by the distribution which yields the highest likelihood of all distributions. This is referred to as the nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator (NPMLE) of the mixing distribution. We refer to Kiefer and Wolfowitz (1956) , Laird (1978) , Lindsay (1983a-c) , and Lindsay et al. (1991) for more details about general theory on NPMLE. The main disadvantages are that this approach is computationally intensive, especially for multivariate random effects, and that it results in a discrete estimate of a possibly continuous random-effects distribution. One therefore often assumes the b i to be sampled from a (multivariate) normal distribution (see, e.g., Magder and Zeger (1996) and Verbeke and Lesaffre (1996) for other parametric random-effects models). Since the mean of this distribution can be incorporated in X i b, it is justified to assume the b i to have mean vector 0. The covariance matrix will be denoted by D. Finally, it is assumed that the random effects are independent of the errors \u00ab i . The resulting model is called the linear mixed(-effects) model with fixed effects b and random effects b i .\nModel (1) naturally follows from a so-called two-stage model formulation. First, a linear regression model is specified for every subject separately, modelling the outcome variable as a function of time. Afterwards, in the second stage, multivariate linear models are used to relate the subject-specific regression parameters from the first-stage model to subject characteristics such as age, gender, treatment, etc. For the rat data for example, Verbeke and Lesaffre (1999) assume that the subject-specific profiles shown in Figure 1 are linear functions of t \u00bc ln\u00f01 \u00fe \u00f0age \u00c0 45\u00de=10\u00de. In the second stage, they allow the slopes to depend on treatment, while the randomization at the age of 45 days allows them to assume the intercepts to be independent of treatment. The resulting linear mixed model is then\nFor the prostate data, Pearson et al. (1994) assume in the first stage that Y \u00bc ln\u00f01 \u00fe PSA\u00de follows a quadratic function over time, while the second stage allows the intercepts as well as linear and quadratic time effects to depend on the disease status, as well as on the age of the subject at the time of the diagnosis. This yields the model\nwhere C i , B i , L i and M i are indicator variables defined to be one if the subject is a control, a BPH case, a local cancer case, or a metastatic cancer case, respectively, and zero otherwise. Obviously, models (2) and (3) can be rewritten in the form (1) for appropriate design matrices X i and Z i . For both examples, it will be assumed in the remainder of this paper that S i is of the form s 2 I n i , for some unknown variance s 2 . We refer to Verbeke and Molenberghs (2000, chapter 10) , Verbeke et al. (1998) , and Lesaffre et al. (2000) for alternative residual covariance models and for examples on how the residual covariance S i can be studied in the presence of random effects."}, {"section_title": "Inference for the marginal model", "text": "Combining all N subject-specific regression models (1) into one model, we get\nwhere the vectors y, b and \u00ab, and the matrix X are obtained from stacking the vectors y i , b i and \u00ab i , and the matrices X i , respectively, underneath each other, and where Z is the blockdiagonal matrix with blocks Z i on the main diagonal and zeros elsewhere. The dimension of y equals P N i\u00bc1 n i and will be denoted by n. Marginally, y is then normal with mean vector Xb and with covariance matrix V equal to the block-diagonal matrix with blocks Often, in practice, the fixed effects in b are of primary interest, as they describe the average evolution in the population. Conditionally on a, the maximum likelihood (ML) estimate for b equals b b b\u00f0a\u00de \u00bc \u00f0X 0 V \u00c01 X\u00de \u00c01 X 0 V \u00c01 y, which is normally distributed with mean b and covariance matrix \u00f0X 0 V \u00c01 X\u00de \u00c01 . This can be used to construct Wald-type tests. In practice, however, a is not known and has to be replaced by an estimate. In order to take into account the variability introduced by estimating the variance components, the chi-squared reference distribution is often replaced by an approximate F distribution, with the usual numerator degrees of freedom. The denominator degrees of freedom need to be estimated from the data. This is often based on so-called Satterthwaite-type approximations (Satterthwaite 1941) . We refer to Verbeke and Molenberghs (1997, section 3.5 .2 and appendix A) for a detailed discussion on this. Kenward and Roger (1997) proposed a scaled Wald statistic, based on an adjusted covariance estimate which accounts for the extra variability introduced by estimating a, and they show that its small sample distribution can be well approximated by an F distribution with denominator degrees of freedom also obtained via a Satterthwaitetype approximation. In general, the different methods usually lead to different results. However, in the analysis of longitudinal data, different subjects contribute independent information, which results in numbers of denominator degrees of freedom which are typically large enough, whatever estimation method is used, to lead to very similar p values. Only for very small samples, or when linear mixed models are used outside the context of longitudinal analyses, many different estimation methods for degrees of freedom lead to severe differences in the resulting p values.\nEstimation of a can be based on the maximum likelihood principle as well. In practice, however, one usually uses restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimation (Harville, 1974) , which allows to estimate the covariance parameters without having to estimate the mean Xb first. It is known from simpler models, such as linear regression models, that this provides better estimates than the classical maximum likelihood method (see, e.g., Verbeke and Molenberghs, 2000, section 5.3) . Under model (4), one proceeds as follows. Let A be any \u00f0n \u00c2 \u00f0n \u00c0 p\u00de\u00de full-rank matrix with columns orthogonal to the columns of X, i.e., A 0 X \u00bc 0. We then have that the vector u \u00bc A 0 y of so-called error contrasts follows a normal distribution with mean vector zero and covariance matrix A 0 V\u00f0a\u00deA, which no longer depends on b. Maximizing the corresponding likelihood function yields the REML estimate for a, which can then be used for the estimation of, and the inference for, the vector b of fixed effects. Harville (1974 Harville ( , 1977 and Patterson and Thompson (1971) have shown that basically no information is lost on a when inference is based on the error contrasts in u rather than on the original data vector y, which justifies the wide use of REML estimation in practice.\nIt can be shown (Harville, 1974) Table 1 . Under ML, minus twice the difference in maximized log-likelihood equals 6.602, which is significant (p \u00bc 0:010) when compared to a chisquared distribution with 1 degree of freedom. Under REML, however, this value equals \u00c02:324, clearly illustrating that a classical LR test cannot be valid in this case. The reason is that the two models generate different sets of error contrasts. This implies that the corresponding REML likelihoods are based on different observations, which makes them no longer comparable. In general, LR tests under REML estimation are only valid for comparing nested models with common mean structure. We refer to Welham and Thompson (1997) for two alternative LR-type tests, based on profile likelihoods, which do allow Table 1 Prostate data.

It should be emphasized that all inferences discussed so far are based on the marginal model N\u00f0Xb; V\u00de. Indeed, even a well-fitting marginal model does not necessarily imply the presence, let alone a distributional form, of random effects b i . The only way to explicitly take such assumptions into account would be to analyze the data in a Bayesian framework (see, e.g., Gelman et al., 1995) . This difference can also be illustrated in the context of the rat example. If the marginal model is believed to be generated by the linear mixed model (2), the covariance matrix D of the random effects should be non-negative definite. Under this restriction, the REML estimate of the variance of the random slopes b 2i equals zero. Some authors (see, e.g., Brown and Prescott, 1999 , section 6.5) interpret this as an indication that the model was overspecified and thus, that the random slopes should be removed from the model. An alternative point of view is that the zero variance indicates that the maximum of the REML log-likelihood function is really on the boundary of the parameter space, suggesting that the REML likelihood could be further increased by removing the restriction that D needs to be non-negative definite. Indeed, the estimate then becomes \u00c00:287. It should be strongly emphasized, however, that the resulting model no longer allows any random-effects interpretation since no model of the form (4) could ever yield a marginal model as has now been obtained. On the other hand, as long as all covariance matrices\n, that is, as long as the covariates Z i take values within a specific range, a valid marginal model is obtained. For example, the fitted variance function is now\nand therefore suggests the presence of negative curvature in the variance function. As an informal check, Figure 3 shows the sample variance function, which indeed supports the 242 G Molenberghs and G Verbeke negative curvature suggested by our fitted variance function. Note again that this is not compatible with model (2). Moreover, removing the random slopes from the model would imply a constant variance function, with constant correlation between any two measurements within rats. This might be over-simplistic and cannot be justified by a zero variance estimate for the random slopes only. More detailed discussions on negative variance components can be found in Nelder (1954) , Thompson (1962) and Searle et al. (1992, section 3.5) .\nNote that the inclusion of random effects in the model only affects the covariance structure in the marginal model. Hence, it follows from the general theory on generalized estimating equations (GEE's) that, if only inference about the mean X i b is of interest, one could as well omit the b i in (1). The fixed effects in b are then still consistently estimated, but correct inferences for b then requires correcting the standard errors using a sandwich-type correction (robust standard errors). We refer to Liang and Zeger (1986) for more details on GEEs."}, {"section_title": "Inference for the random effects", "text": "Although in practice one is usually primarily interested in estimating the parameters in the marginal model, it is often useful to calculate estimates for the random effects b i as well, since they reflect how much the subject-specific profiles deviate from the overall average profile. Such estimates can then be interpreted as residuals which may be helpful for detecting special profiles (i.e., outlying individuals) or groups of individuals evolving differently over time. Also, estimates for the random effects are needed whenever interest is in prediction of subject-specific evolutions. Obviously, it is then no longer sufficient to assume that the data can be well described by the marginal model N\u00f0Xb; V\u00de. Instead, one has to explicitly assume that the linear mixed model (1) is appropriate. Since random effects represent a natural heterogeneity between the subjects, this assumption will often be justified for data where the between-subjects variability is large in comparison to the within-subject variability.\nSince the subject-specific parameters in model (1) are assumed random, it is most natural to estimate them using Bayesian techniques (see, for example, Box and Tiao, 1992; Gelman et al., 1995) . Conditional on b i , y i follows a multivariate normal distribution with mean vector X i b \u00fe Z i b i and with covariance matrix S i . In combination with the distributional assumptions for b i , one can easily derive (Smith, 1973; Lindley and Smith, 1972) \nNote that (5) (Laird and Ware, 1982) ."}, {"section_title": "Review of linear mixed models 243", "text": "So far, all calculations were performed conditionally upon the vector u of parameters in the marginal model. In practice, the unknown parameters b and a in b b i b i \u00f0u\u00de, (5), and (6) are replaced by their maximum or restricted maximum likelihood estimates. The resulting estimates for the random effects are called 'empirical Bayes' (EB) estimates, which we will denote by b b i b i . Note that (5) and (6) then underestimate the true variability in the obtained estimate b b i b i since they do not take into account the variability introduced by replacing the unknown parameter u by its estimate. Similar to that for fixed effects (see section 3), inference is therefore often based on approximate t tests or F tests, rather than on Wald tests, with similar procedures for the estimation of the denominator degrees of freedom as for inference for the fixed effects b.\nIt immediately follows from (6) that, for any linear combination lb i of the random effects,\nindicating that the EB estimates show less variability than actually present in the random-effects population. This phenomenon is usually referred to as shrinkage (Carlin and Louis, 1996; Strenio et al., 1983) . The shrinkage is also seen in the prediction\nof the ith profile, which can be rewritten as\ny i can be interpreted as a weighted average of the population-averaged profile X i b b b and the observed data y i , with weights S i V \u00c01 i and\nis the residual covariance matrix S i and the 'denominator' is the overall covariance matrix V i . Hence, severe shrinkage is to be expected when the residual variability is large in comparison to the between-subject variability (modeled by the random effects), whereas little shrinkage will occur if the opposite is true.\nAs a simple example, we consider the random-intercepts model, that is, a linear mixed model where the only subject-specific effects are intercepts. The random-effects covariance matrix D then is a scalar and will be denoted by s 2 b . Assuming that all residual covariance matrices are of the form S i \u00bc s 2 I n i , it can easily be derived that the EB estimate for the random intercept of subject i is given by\nwhere the vector x ij consists of the jth row in the design matrix X i . Note that r r i\u00c1 \u00bc P n i j\u00bc1 \u00f0y ij \u00c0 x 0 ij b\u00de=n i is equal to the average residual for subject i. Expression (7) clearly illustrates the shrinkage effect. It immediately follows from n i s\nis a weighted average of zero (the prior mean of b i ) and the average residual r r i\u00c1 . The larger the number n i of measurements available for subject i, the more weight is put on r r i\u00c1 , yielding less severe shrinkage. Expression (7) also shows that more shrinkage is obtained in cases where the within-subject variability is large in comparison to the between-subject variability.\nIn practice, one often uses histograms and scatter plots of components of b b i b i for diagnostic purposes, such as the detection of outliers which are subjects who seem to evolve differently from the other subjects in the data set. As an illustration, Figure 4 shows frequency histograms and scatter plots of the EB estimates for the random effects in model (3) for the prostate data. Note how the scatter plots clearly show strong negative correlations between the intercepts and slopes for time, and between the slopes for time and the slopes for time 2 . On the other hand, the intercepts are positively correlated with the slopes for the 244 G Molenberghs and G Verbeke quadratic time effect. This is in agreement with the estimates for the covariance parameters in D (not shown here). Furthermore, we highlighted subjects no. 22, 28, 39, and 45, who are the individuals with the highest four quadratic time effects and the smallest four linear time effects. Hence, these are the subjects with the strongest (quadratic) growth of ln\u00f01 \u00fe PSA\u00de over time. Pearson et al. (1994) noticed that the local=regional cancer cases no. 22, 28, and 39 were misclassified by the original methods of clinical staging and should have been included in the group of metastatic cancer cases instead. Further, subject no. 45 is the Although the use of the EB estimates for model evaluation seems natural, the interpretation of histograms or scatter plots of components of b b i b i can be seriously hampered under severe shrinkage. For example, shrinkage implies that histograms do not necessarily reflect the correct random-effects distribution. This has been illustrated by Verbeke and Lesaffre (1996) , who simulated 1000 longitudinal profiles of 5 measurements, from a linear mixed model with intercepts as the only random effects in the model. The distribution of the random effects was chosen to be a clear bimodal mixture of two normals. Still, a histogram of the EB estimates, obtained assuming that the intercepts follow a single univariate normal distribution, supported the normality assumption. Obviously, the EB estimates are very dependent on their assumed distribution. This is in contrast to the ML and REML estimates for the parameters in the marginal model, which are very robust with respect to misspecifications of the random-effects distribution (Verbeke and Lesaffre 1997) ."}, {"section_title": "The missing data problem", "text": "The problem of dealing with missing values is common throughout statistical work and is nearly always present in the analysis of longitudinal data. Early work on missing values was largely concerned with algorithmic and computational solutions to the induced lack of balance or deviations from the intended study design (Afifi and Elashoff, 1966; Hartley and Hocking, 1971 ). More recently, general algorithms, such as the expectation-maximization (EM; Dempster et al., 1977) , and data imputation and augmentation procedures (Rubin, 1987; Tanner and Wong, 1987) , combined with powerful computing resources have largely provided a solution to this aspect of the problem. There remains the very difficult and important question of assessing the impact of missing data on subsequent statistical inference. Conditions can be formulated under which an analysis that proceeds as if the missing data are missing by design (i.e., ignoring the missing value process) can provide valid answers to study questions. The difficulty in practice is that such conditions can rarely be assumed to hold. A key point is that, when undertaking such analyses, assumptions will be required that cannot be assessed from the data under analysis. Hence, in this setting, there can be no such thing as a definitive analysis, and arguably the appropriate statistical framework is one of sensitivity analysis. Rubin (1976) and Little and Rubin (1987, chapter 6 ) distinguish between different missing values processes. A dropout process is said to be completely random (MCAR) if the dropout is independent of both unobserved and observed data, and random (MAR) if, conditional on the observed data, the dropout is independent of the unobserved measurements; otherwise, the dropout process is termed nonrandom (MNAR). If a dropout process is random, then valid inference can be obtained through a likelihood-based analysis that ignores the dropout 246 G Molenberghs and G Verbeke mechanism, provided the parameters describing the measurement process are functionally independent of the parameters describing the dropout process, the so-called parameter distinctness condition. This situation is termed ignorable and leads to considerable simplification in the analysis. Overviews of modeling strategies are given by Little (1995) and Kenward and Molenberghs (1999) .\nLet us introduce the necessary additional notation. For subject i and occasion j, define R ij \u00bc 1 if y ij is observed and 0 otherwise. For convenience, partition y i into two subvectors such that y o i is the vector containing those y ij for which R ij \u00bc 1 and y m i contains the remaining components. Statistical modeling begins by considering the full data density f \u00f0y i ; r i jX i ; Z i ; u; c\u00de where, as before, X i and Z i are the design matrices for fixed and random effects, respectively, and u and c are vectors that parametrize the joint distribution.\nA large class of models are based on the selection model factorization:\nwhere the first factor is the marginal density of the measurement process and the second one is the density of the missingness process, conditional on the outcomes. It is possible to have additional covariates in the missingness model, but this is suppressed from notation. An alternative taxonomy can be built based on so-called pattern-mixture models (Little, 1993 (Little, , 1994 . These are based on the factorization f \u00f0y i ; r i jX i ; Z i ; u; c\u00de \u00bc f \u00f0y i jr i ; X i ; Z i ; u\u00def \u00f0r i jX i ; c\u00de:\nWe will discuss each of these frameworks in turn."}, {"section_title": "Selection models", "text": "Much of the early development of, and debate about, selection models appeared in the econometrics literature in which the Tobit model (Heckman, 1976 ) played a central role. This combines a marginal Gaussian regression model for the response, as might be used in the absence of missing data, with a Gaussian-based threshold model for the probability of a value being missing. The selection model of Diggle and Kenward (1994) is essentially a variation to this theme, combining the multivariate Gaussian linear model with a logistic dropout model. For the full likelihood analyses, subject-by-subject integration is required in general, unless MAR is assumed. This makes maximization somewhat cumbersome. Diggle and Kenward (1994) used the Nelder and Mead simplex algorithm (Nelder and Mead, 1965) . However, such an approach lacks flexibility and is inefficient for high-dimensional problems. Alternatives are the EM algorithm and direct likelihood maximization. Let us consider the Diggle and Kenward selection model in some more detail. We assume the measurement model to be of the linear mixed model (1) form. Assuming that the first measurement Y i1 is obtained for every subject in the study, the model for the dropout process is based on a logistic regression for the probability of dropout at occasion j, given the subject Review of linear mixed models 247 was still in the study up to occasion j. We denote this probability by g\u00f0h ij ; y ij \u00de, in which the history h ij is a vector containing all responses observed up to but not including occasion j, as well as relevant covariates. We then assume that g\u00f0h ij ; y ij \u00de satisfies\n\u00f0i \u00bc 1; . . . ; N\u00de. Here,h h ij is a suitable subset of h ij . When o equals zero, the dropout model is random, and all parameters can be estimated using standard software since the measurement model for which we use a linear mixed model and the dropout model, assumed to follow a logistic regression, can then be fitted separately. If o 6 \u00bc 0, the dropout process is assumed to be nonrandom. Let us apply the above modeling strategy to the Vorozole data, described in the introduction. Since we are modeling change versus baseline, all models are forced to pass through the origin. The following covariates were considered for the measurement model: baseline value, treatment, dominant site, stage, and time in months. Second-order interactions were considered as well. For design reasons, treatment was kept in the model in spite of its nonsignificance. An F test for treatment effect produces a p value of 0.5822. Apart from baseline, no other time-stationary covariates were kept. A quadratic time effect provided an adequate description of the time trend. We confined the random-effects structure to random intercepts and supplemented this with a Gaussian serial correlation component and measurement error. The final measurement model is presented in Table 2 .\nFitted profiles are displayed in Figure 5 and Figure 6 . In Figure 6 , empirical Bayes estimates of the random effects are included, whereas in Figure 5 , the purely marginal mean is used. For each treatment group, we obtain three sets of profiles. The fitted complete profile is the average curve that would be obtained had all individuals been completely observed. If we use only those predicted values that correspond to occasions at which an observation was made, then the fitted incomplete profiles are obtained. The latter are somewhat above the former when the random effects are included, and somewhat below when they are not, suggesting that individuals with lower measurements are more likely to disappear from the study. This indicates that, when data are incomplete, one should be careful with 'standard' comparisons between observed and fitted profiles. In addition, although the fitted complete curves are Figure 5 Vorozole study. Fitted profiles (averaging the predicted means for the incomplete and complete measurment sequences, without the random effects) Figure 6 Vorozole study. Fitted profiles (averaging the predicted means for the incomplete and complete measurment sequences, including the random effects) very close (the treatment effect was not significant), the fitted incomplete curves are not, suggesting that there is more dropout in the standard arm than in the treatment arm. This is in agreement with the dropout rate and should not be seen as evidence of a bad fit. Finally, the observed curves, based on the measurements available at each time point, are displayed. These are higher than the fitted ones, but still consistent with the observed variability. Next, we will study the dropout process, using model (10). First, we will focus on MAR (i.e., o \u00bc 0), whereafter we will allow for nonrandom processes. A first MAR model includes treatment, dominant site, stage group, baseline, and the previous measurement, but only the last two are significant, producing logit\u00bdg\u00f0h ij \u00de \u00bc 0:080\u00f00:341\u00de \u00c0 0:014\u00f00:003\u00debase i \u00c0 0:033\u00f00:004\u00dey i;j\u00c01 :\nIt is important to note that one can extend this model by using more observed outcomes, thereby remaining within the MAR framework. Both Diggle and Kenward (1994) and Molenberghs et al. (1997) observed that in nonrandom models, dropout tends to depend on the increment (i.e., the difference between the current and previous measurements y ij \u00c0 y i;j\u00c01 ). Including this effect implies a switch to the MAR framework. However, this quantity is likely to be highly associated with the preceding increment, y i;j\u00c01 \u00c0 y i;j\u00c02 , a major advantage of which is that it belongs to the MAR framework. In our case, we obtain logit\u00bdg\u00f0h ij \u00de \u00bc 0:033\u00f00:401\u00de \u00c0 0:013\u00f00:003\u00debase i \u00fe 0:012\u00f00:006\u00dey i;j\u00c02 \u00c0 0:035\u00f00:005\u00dey i;j\u00c01\n\u00bc 0:033\u00f00:401\u00de \u00c0 0:013\u00f00:003\u00debase i \u00c0 0:023\u00f00:005\u00de y i;j\u00c02 \u00fe y i;j\u00c01 2 \u00c0 0:047\u00f00:010\u00de y i;j\u00c01 \u00c0 y i;j\u00c02 2 \u00f012\u00de\nindicating that both size and increment are significant predictors for dropout. We conclude that dropout increases with a decrease in baseline, in overall level of the outcome variable, as well as with a decreasing evolution in the outcome. Both dropout models (11) and (12) can be compared with their nonrandom counterparts, where y ij is added to the linear predictor. The first one becomes logit\u00bdg\u00f0h ij ; y ij \u00de \u00bc 0:53 \u00c0 0:015base i \u00c0 0:076y i;j\u00c01 \u00fe 0:057y ij \u00f013\u00de\nand the second one becomes logit\u00bdg\u00f0h ij ; y ij \u00de \u00bc 1:38 \u00c0 0:021base i \u00c0 0:0027y i;j\u00c02 \u00c0 0:064y i;j\u00c01 \u00fe 0:\nIt turns out that model (14) is not significantly better than (12) and hence we retain (12) as the most plausible description of the dropout process we have so far obtained. Thus, the dropout probability decreases with (1) a favorable initial score, (2) a favorable current score, (3) a favorable evolution. All of this is in line with intuition and can be derived based on a sufficiently flexible MAR model, thereby avoiding problems that surround MNAR models. We will expand on the latter point in Sections 7 and 8."}, {"section_title": "Pattern-mixture models", "text": "The high sensitivity of selection modeling results to the correct specification of the measurement model as well as the dropout model, about which little is often known, has been extensively documented. This has lead to growing interest in pattern-mixture modeling, based on factorization (9). After initial mention of pattern-mixture models, they are receiving more attention lately (Little, 1993 (Little, , 1994 (Little, , 1995 Hogan and Laird, 1997; Ekholm and Skinner, 1998; Molenberghs et al., 1998a,b) . We will first illustrate the idea of pattern-mixture modeling using a simple setting. Let us adopt pattern-mixture decomposition (9), suppress dependence on covariates and focus on dropout:\nConsider a continuous response at three times of measurement which will be modeled using a trivariate Gaussian distribution. Assume that there may be dropout at time 2 or 3, and let the dropout indicator D i take the values 1 and 2 to indicate that the last observation occurred at these times and 3 to indicate no dropout. Then, in the first instance, the model implies a different distribution for each time of dropout. We can write\nfor d \u00bc 1; 2; 3. Let P\u00f0d\u00de \u00bc p d \u00bc f \u00f0d i jc\u00de, then the marginal distribution of the response is a mixture of normals with, for example, mean\nThe variance of the corresponding estimator can be derived by application of the delta method. However, although the p d can be simply estimated from the observed proportions in each dropout group, only 16 of the 27 response parameters can be identified from the data without making further assumptions. These 16 comprise all the parameters from the completers plus those from the appropriate submodels in the sequences of lengths 2 and 1. This is a saturated pattern-mixture model and this particular representation makes it very clear what information each dropout group provides and, consequently, the assumptions that need to be made if we are to predict the behavior of the unobserved responses, and so obtain marginal models for the response. If the three sets of parameters m\u00f0d\u00de are simply equated, with the same holding for the corresponding variance components, then this implies that dropout is completely random. Little (1993) introduces so-called complete case missing value (CCMV) restrictions. These can be defined in terms of conditional distributions. Let y \u00bc \u00f0y 1 ; y 2 ; . . . ; y n \u00de 0 . Then the CCMV restrictions imply that for any D \u00bc d < j f \u00f0y j jy 1 ; . . . ; y j\u00c01 ; D \u00bc d\u00de \u00bc f \u00f0y j jy 1 ; . . . ; y j\u00c01 ; D \u00bc n\u00de:\nReview of linear mixed models 251 Little (1993) shows how these constraints can be used to identify all the parameters in the model and so obtain estimates for these and the marginal probabilities. The CCMV restrictions essentially equate conditional distributions beyond time d (i.e., those unidentifiable from this dropout group), with the same conditional distributions from the completers. A stronger restriction is to identify the former conditional distributions and all conditional distributions from those who drop out after d. This has been called the available case missing value (ACMV) restrictions and it has been shown (Molenberghs et al., 1998b) that, for dropout, these conditions are equivalent to MAR in the selection model framework.\nIn practice, choice of restrictions will need to be guided by the context. In addition, the form of the data will typically be more complex, requiring, for example, a more structured model for the response with the incorporation of covariates. Hence, models for f \u00f0d i jc\u00de can be constructed in many ways. Most authors assume the dropout process is fully observed and that D i satisfies a parametric model Bailey, 1988, 1989; Little, 1993; De Gruttola and Tu, 1994) . Hogan and Laird (1997) extend this to cases where the dropout time is allowed to be right censored and no parametric restrictions are put on the dropout times. Their conditional model for y o i given D i is a linear mixed model with dropout time as one of the covariates in the mean structure. Due to the right censoring, the estimation method must handle incomplete covariates. Hogan and Laird (1997) use the EM algorithm (Dempster et al., 1977) for ML estimation.\nLet us now turn to the Vorozole data. In analogy with our selection model, the profiles are forced to pass through the origin. This is done by allowing only time main effects and interactions of other covariables with time in the model. The most complex pattern-mixture model we consider includes a different parameter vector for each of the observed patterns. This is done by having all effects in the model interact with pattern, a factor variable. We then proceed by backward selection in order to simplify the model. First, we found that the covariance structure is common to all patterns, encompassing random intercept, a serial exponential process, and measurement error.\nFor the fixed effects, we proceeded as follows. A backward selection procedure was conducted, starting from a model that includes a main effect of time and time . This reduced model can be found in Table 3 . As was the case with the selection model in Table 2 , the treatment effect is nonsignificant. Indeed, a single degree of freedom F test yields a p value of 0.687. Note that such a test is possible since treatment effect does not interact with pattern, in contrast to the model which we will describe next. The fitted profiles are displayed in Figure 7 . We observe that the profiles for both arms are very similar. This is due to the fact that treatment effect is not significant but perhaps also because we did not allow a more complex treatment effect. For example, we might consider an interaction of treatment with the square of time and, more importantly, a treatment effect which is pattern-specific.\nOur second, expanded model allowed for up to cubic time effects, the interaction of time with dropout pattern, dominant site, baseline value and treatment, as well as their two-and three-way interactions. After a backward selection procedure, the effects included are time and time 2 , the two-way interaction of time and dropout pattern, as well as three-factor interactions of time and dropout pattern with (1) baseline, (2) group, and (3) dominant site. Review of linear mixed models 253"}, {"section_title": "G Molenberghs and G Verbeke", "text": "Finally, time 2 interacts with dropout pattern and with the interaction of baseline and dropout pattern. No cubic time effects were necessary. The model is graphically represented in Figure 8 .\nBecause a pattern-specific parameter has been included, we have several options for the assessment of treatment. Since there are 13 patterns (remember, we cut off the patterns at 2 years), one can test the global hypothesis, based on 13 degrees of freedom, of no treatment effect. We obtain F \u00bc 1:25, producing p \u00bc 0:240, indicating that there is no overall treatment effect. Each of the treatment effects separately is at a nonsignificant level. Alternatively, the marginal effect of treatment can be calculated, which is the weighted average of the pattern-specific treatment effects, with weights given by the probability of occurrence of the various patterns. Its standard error is calculated using a straightforward application of the delta method. This effect is equal to \u00c00:286\u00f00:288\u00de, producing a p value of 0.321, which is still nonsignificant. We obtain a nonsignificant treatment effect from all our different models, whether selection or pattern-mixture based, which gives more weight to this conclusion."}, {"section_title": "Sensitivity analysis", "text": "It is clear that incomplete longitudinal data pose specific challenges related to sensitivity to modeling assumptions. Even when the linear mixed model would beyond any doubt be the choice of preference to describe the measurement process should the data be complete, then the analysis of the actually observed incomplete version is still subject to further untestable modeling assumptions. When MAR or even MNAR models are considered, several choices 254 G Molenberghs and G Verbeke have to be made. For example, one has to choose between selection and pattern-mixture models, or an alternative framework such as shared-parameter models Bailey, 1988, 1989; Wu and Carroll, 1988; Little, 1995) .\nThe sensitivity of the selection model framework has been indicated by Glynn et al. (1986) , Draper (1995) , Copas and Li (1997) and Vach and Blettner (1995) . Because the model of Diggle and Kenward (1994) fits within the class of selection models, it is fair to say that it raised, at first, too high expectations. This was made clear by many discussants of the paper. It implies that, for example, formal tests for the null hypothesis of random missingness, although technically possible, should be approached with caution. In response to these concerns, there is growing awareness of the need for methods that investigate the sensitivity of the results with respect to the model assumptions. See, for example, Nordheim (1984) , Little (1994) , Rubin (1994) , Laird (1994) , Fitzmaurice et al. (1995) , Molenberghs et al. (1999 Molenberghs et al. ( , 2001 ), Kenward and Molenberghs (1999) and Verbeke et al. (2001a) .\nWe could define a sensitivity analysis as one in which several statistical models are considered simultaneously and=or where a statistical model is further scrutinized using specialized tools (such as diagnostic measures). This rather loose and very general definition encompasses a wide variety of useful approaches. The simplest procedure is to fit a selected number of (nonrandom) models which are all deemed plausible or one in which a preferred (primary) analysis is supplemented with a number of variations. The extent to which conclusions (inferences) are stable across such ranges provides an indication about the belief that can be put into them. Variations to a basic model can be constructed in different ways. The most obvious strategy is to consider various dependencies of the missing data process on the outcomes and=or on covariates. Alternatively, the distributional assumptions of the models can be changed.\nIn Section 7 we studied pattern-mixture models and indicated they are chronically underidentified. Consequently, Little (1993 Little ( , 1994 Little ( , 1995 suggested the use of so-called identifying restrictions to overcome this underidentification. Choosing a set of different restriction schemes, rather than a single one, is an obvious way to pass from a standard approach to sensitivity analysis (Thijs et al., 2002) .\nThe need to use identifying restrictions is often quoted as an advantage for pattern-mixture models since it forces careful reflection on the nature of the assumptions made. On the other hand, in the analysis of the Vorozole data, no use was made of identifying restrictions. Precisely, pattern was included as a covariate in both the fixed-effects and variance portions of the models. Subsequent simplification lead to a model which was easy to extrapolate.\nThis points to the fact that there are broadly three strategies to build a full data model in the pattern-mixture context: identifying restrictions, simple within-pattern models, and the inclusion of pattern as a covariate, the latter of which allows for the combination of information across patterns. A few observations are in place. First, although identifying restrictions impose a careful reflection on the unidentified part of the distribution, the other strategies are more implicit about the assumptions made to identify the full distribution. In this respect, they are open to some of the criticisms toward selection models. Second, the identifying-restrictions strategy is harder to implement, unless in fairly simple settings, such as a single normal sample or contingency tables (Little 1993 (Little , 1994 . Third, in the selection modeling framework, the MAR assumption plays a crucial role. It can be seen as a compromise between the very rigid and unrealistic MCAR assumption and the complex and fundamentally problematic MNAR assumptions."}, {"section_title": "Local in\u00a3uence", "text": "A famous remark attributed to George Box is that all statistical models are wrong, but some are useful. Cook (1986) uses this idea to motivate his assessment of local influence. He suggests that more confidence can be put in a model which is relatively stable under small modifications. The best known perturbation schemes are based on case deletion in which the effect is studied of completely removing cases from the analysis. A quite different paradigm is the local influence approach where one investigates how the results of an analysis are changed under small perturbations of the model. Lesaffre and Verbeke (1998) have shown that the local influence approach is useful for the detection of influential subjects in longitudinal data analysis. Moreover, since the resulting influence diagnostics can be expressed analytically, they often can be decomposed in interpretable components, leading to additional insight.\nIn our case, we are interested in the influence the non-randomness of dropout exerts on the parameters of interest, which will most often be the fixed-effects parameters, possibly supplemented with the variance components. Verbeke et al. (2001a) have done this by considering (10) as the dropout model. Indeed, o i \u00bc 0 for all i corresponds to a MAR process, which cannot influence the measurement model parameters. When small perturbations in a specific o i lead to relatively large differences in the model parameters, this suggests that the subject likely drives the conclusions in a disproportionate fashion. For example, if such a subject would drive the model towards MNAR, then the conditional expectations of the unobserved measurements, given the observed ones, may deviate substantially from the ones under a MAR mechanism. Precisely this was observed by Kenward (1998) . This implies that influence on the dropout parameters may also have an impact on the measurement model parameters. Indeed, since the conditional expectations change, so will the measurement model parameters. Hence, its detection is usually very important. Recall that in the current example both the dropout (mastitis) and outcome (milk yield) processes are of importance. Finally, note that such impact can indeed arise from a complete subject.\nWe denote the log-likelihood function by dropout. Strongly different estimates suggest that the estimation procedure is highly sensitive to such perturbations, which suggests that the choice between a MAR model and a nonrandom dropout model highly affects the results of the analysis. Cook (1986) proposed to measure the distance between b g g o and b g g by the so-called likelihood displacement, defined by\nThis takes into account the variability of b g g. Indeed, LD\u00f0v\u00de will be large if '\u00f0gjv 0 \u00de is strongly curved at b g g, which means that g is estimated with high precision, and small otherwise. Therefore, a graph of LD\u00f0v\u00de versus v contains essential information on the influence of perturbations. It is useful to view this graph as the geometric surface formed by the values of the \u00f0N \u00fe 1\u00de-dimensional vector j\u00f0v\u00de \u00bc v LD\u00f0v\u00de\nSince this so-called influence graph can only be depicted when N \u00bc 2, Cook (1986) proposed to look at local influence, i.e., at the normal curvatures (in the differential geometry sense), C h say, of j\u00f0v\u00de in v 0 , in the direction of some N-dimensional vector h of unit length. Let D i be the s-dimensional vector defined by\nand define D as the (s \u00c2 N) matrix with D i as its ith column. Further, let \u20ac L L denote the (s \u00c2 s) matrix of second other derivatives of '\u00f0gjv 0 \u00de with respect to g, also evaluated at g \u00bc b g g. Cook (1986) has then shown that C h can be easily calculated by Verbeke et al. (2001a) applied these ideas to the DK model, leading to Verbeke et al. (2001a) argued that an analysis on the first outcome and the increment between the first and second outcomes is more insightful. Figure 9 displays overall C i , as well as influences for subvectors y, b, a and c. In addition, the direction h max corresponding to maximal local influence is given. We observe large Review of linear mixed models 257 absolute scale differences for different influence graphs. The absolute magnitude of C i \u00f0\u00c1\u00de depends upon the scale on which the measurements and=or covariates are expressed, and hence influence graphs should be interpreted in a relative fashion.\nThe largest C i are observed for rats no. 10, 16, 35 and 41, and virtually the same picture holds for C i \u00f0c\u00de. All four belong to the low-dose group. Arguably, their relatively large influence is caused by an interplay of three facts. First, the profiles are relatively high, and hence y ij and h ij are large. Second, since all four profiles are complete, it can be shown that (19) is large. Third, the computed v ij are relatively large, which is implied by the MAR dropout model parameter estimates. Indeed, for these measurements, the logit of the dropout probability is closest to 0 and hence v ij is fairly close to its maximal value of 0.25.\nTurning attention to C i \u00f0a\u00de reveals peaks for rats no. 5 and 23. Both belong to the control group and drop out after a single measurement occasion. To explain this, note that the relative magnitude of C i \u00f0a\u00de is determined by 1 \u00c0 g\u00f0h id \u00de and h id \u00c0 l\u00f0h id \u00de. The first term is large when the probability of dropout is small. Now, when dropout occurs early in the sequence, the measurements are still relatively low, implying that the dropout probability is rather small. This feature is built into the model by writing the dropout probability in terms of the raw measurements with time-independent coefficients rather than, for example, in terms of residuals. Alternatively, the dropout model parameters could be made time dependent. Further, the residual h id \u00c0 l\u00f0h id \u00de is large since these two rats are somewhat distant from their group-by-time mean.\nAll deviations discussed are fairly moderate. This conclusion is supported by the observation that the components of the normalized vector h max do not deviate much from 1= ffiffiffiffi ffi N p and To further explore the properties of the influence diagnostics, we consider a second analysis where all responses for rats no. 10, 16, 35 and 41 have been increased by 20 units. A graphical display of the local influence measures is given in Figure 10 . The peaks in C i and C i \u00f0c\u00de observed earlier have become much clearer. Thus, the fact that the test statistics for MAR versus MCAR and for MNAR versus MAR have become significant is correctly explained by the influence analysis to have been driven by the four extreme profiles.\nGraphical representations such as Figure 10 are sometimes judged misleading since the apparent magnitude of a subject is influenced by its neighbors. On the other hand, it preserves the order across all six index plots. One way to overcome this problem is by ordering one plot (e.g., according to C i ) and keeping this order across all six panels. This is done in Figure 11 . Alternatively, scatter plots of (1) the measurement versus dropout components and (2) fixed-effects versus variance component elements can be used. An example of the latter is presented in Figure 12 . In this figure, the axes are extended slightly below zero for ease of display, even though these values are always non-negative.\nThe analysis of the rat data set supports the claim that the influence measures are easy to interpret. In addition to the advantages quoted earlier, we claim that a careful study of the conditions under which the diagnostics become large can shed some light on the adequacy of the model formulation. For example, the Diggle and Kenward (1994) model usually writes the logit of the dropout probability as a function of the raw measurements, with timeindependent coefficients. This implies that an expression for the dropout probability depends directly on the magnitude of the responses. An alternative parameterization of the dropout For ease of understanding, consider the special case of three measurements. In this case, there are only three patterns and identification takes the following form: f 3 \u00f0y 1 ; y 2 ; y 3 \u00de \u00bc f 3 \u00f0y 1 ; y 2 ; y 3 \u00de \u00f0 22\u00de f 2 \u00f0y 1 ; y 2 ; y 3 \u00de \u00bc f 2 \u00f0y 1 ; y 2 \u00def 3 \u00f0y 3 jy 1 ; y 2 \u00de \u00f0 23\u00de f 1 \u00f0y 1 ; y 2 ; y 3 \u00de \u00bc f 1 \u00f0y 1 \u00de\u00bdof 2 \u00f0y 2 jy 1 \u00de \u00fe \u00f01 \u00c0 o\u00def 3 \u00f0y 2 jy 1 \u00de \u00c2 f 3 \u00f0y 3 jy 1 ; y 2 \u00de: \u00f024\u00de\nSince f 3 \u00f0y 1 ; y 2 ; y 3 \u00de is completely identifiable from the data, and for f 2 \u00f0y 1 ; y 2 ; y 3 \u00de there is only one possible identification; the only place where a choice has to be made in pattern 1. Setting\nThe conditional density f 1 \u00f0y 2 jy 1 \u00de in (24) can be rewritten as\nWe will now apply the proposed methodology to the Vorozole study, restricted to those subjects with 1, 2, and 3 follow-up measurements, respectively. Thus, 190 subjects are included into the analysis, with subsample sizes 35, 86 and 69, respectively. The corresponding pattern probabilities are b p p \u00bc \u00f00:184; 0:453; 0:\nThese figures, apart from giving a feel for the relative importance of the various patterns, will be needed to calculate marginal effects (such as the marginal treatment effect) from patternmixture model parameters. In order to apply the identifying restriction Strategy 1, one first needs to fit a model to the observed data. We will opt for a simple model, with parameters specific to each pattern. Such a model can be seen as belonging to the second modeling strategy. Next, restrictions are applied. Finally, in the third strategy, pattern is included as a covariate. An initial model is simplified using F tests. A graphical impression of these models is given in Figure 13 . In particular, the simple Strategy 3 yields highly implausible fitted profiles. These findings suggest, again, that a more careful reflection on the extrapolation method is required. This is very well possible in a pattern-mixture context, but then the first strategy, rather than the second and third strategies, has to be used."}, {"section_title": "Computational issues", "text": "The fitting of linear mixed models is usually done via Newton-Raphson-based procedures. Based on some starting values for the parameters, these procedures iteratively update the estimates until sufficient convergence has been obtained. When fitting complex linear mixed models, the practising statistician is often faced with nonconverging iteration processes, in the sense that the iterative process does not converge at all, or that it converges to parameter values on or outside the boundary of the parameter space. In some cases, this can be solved by specifying better starting values, or by using other numerical procedures. In many cases however, divergence is an indicator of substantial problems with the parametrization of the model or the assumptions implied by the model. It should be emphasized that such numerical problems always arise from estimating the variance components in the model, not from estimating the fixed effects. This can easily be explained from the fact that the classical ordinary least squares estimator for the vector of fixed effects, although completely ignoring the longitudinal structure of the data, is unbiased and consistent and therefore provides good starting values for the fixed effects. This is in contrast to the variance components for which good starting values are often hard to obtain, especially in complex models with many variance components.\nA frequently encountered reason for convergence problems is very small variability in some of the components of the random effects b i . In most cases, this can simply be avoided by appropriately rescaling the responses and=or the covariates. For example, fitting model collection of subject-specific regression models, most diagnostic tools used in classical linear regression do not immediately carry over. In ordinary linear regression, structure is largely confined to the linear predictor. The longitudinal setting, however, additionally requires the specification of an appropriate covariance structure, further implying the need for specific design, exploratory and confirmatory tools. One such exploratory tool is the semi-variogram (Diggle, 1988) , which has been extended by Verbeke et al. (1998) .\nAt the confirmatory end, model diagnostics need careful reflection. First, in many applications the normality assumption of the random-effects may be violated. The complicating factor here is that the random effects are unobserved and, related to this, that the estimators are strongly depending on the prior normality assumption. One way to overcome this issue is more general distributional assumptions such as finite mixtures of normals (Magder and Zeger, 1996; Verbeke and Lesaffre, 1996) . Alternatively, one can avoid any distributional assumptions leading to non-parametric maximum likelihood (NPMLE, Aitken, 1999) . Second, the detection of influential subjects could, in principle, be done using global deletion methods (Chatterjee and Hadi, 1988) . Of course, such an approach requires refitting the model for each subject. Unlike classical regression, fitting the linear mixed model generally requires iterative numerical algorithms, making this approach extremely timeconsuming. Therefore, local-influence-based alternatives (Cook, 1986; Lesaffre and Verbeke, 1998) have been proposed. This method leads to closed-form influence expressions. Apart from being computationally more efficient, one can easily decompose the overall influence measure into components referring to specific aspects of the model.\nApart from the basic linear mixed model, a number of extensions and alternative approaches have been proposed. We already mentioned models with other than normally distributed random effects. Verbyla et al. (1999) assume a spline-based structure for the random-effects. Verbeke et al. (2001b) condition on sufficient statistics for baseline differences, in order to get inference for the longitudinal effects, unaffected by misspecification of the cross-sectional effects.\nConsiderable emphasis was placed on the practical implications of the very common problem of dropout in longitudinal studies. In this context, validity of inference highly depends on the relationship between the measurement and dropout processes. There are several broad classes of models for the joint distribution of these two processes, the main ones being selection modeling and pattern-mixture modeling. In both classes, models are identified only at the expense of strong and to a large extent unverifiable assumptions. This underscores the need for sensitivity analysis. It has been illustrated that such a sensitivity analysis can be conducted in a number of ways. First, one can compare the substantive conclusions from a series of selection and=or pattern-mixture models. Further, within each class, more formal frameworks have been developed. Several alternative techniques have been proposed in the literature. Scharfstein et al. (1999) develop a sensitivity analysis for semi-parametric (i.e., GEE based) models. Molenberghs et al. (2001a) included sensitivity parameters in the model in order to replace a single identified model by a class of models.\nIn conclusion, it is fair to say that the linear mixed model has become a frequently used and well studied tool within the applied statistical community. This is largely due to the availability of software within commercial packages (SAS, SPlus, MLwiN, . . .). However, some of the more advanced tools described in this paper are not yet widely available. This reiterates it is still an active area of research."}]
