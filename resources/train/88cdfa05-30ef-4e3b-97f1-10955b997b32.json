Currently, prediction of a TC's wind field can be achieved through multiple approaches. One approach is through the use of atmospheric models, which are either statistical, dynamical, or combined statisticaldynamical, to obtain wind forecasts or nowcasts. The statistical ones empirically predict the evolution of a TC by extrapolating from historical datasets, while the dynamical models solve the full set of primitive equations of fluid flow in the atmosphere to obtain numerical results, which are quite computationally intensive. In recent years, the kinematic analysis approach showed promise to offer more realistic and accurate wind estimates, either in real-time or in hindcast mode. One example is the Surface Wind Analysis System (H*Wind) operated by the Hurricane Research Division (HRD) before 2014, which produces H*Wind snapshots of TCs from 1993 -2013 by assimilating all available surface wind observations (e.g., from ships, buoys, coastal platforms, reconnaissance aircrafts, and satellites, etc.) into a common framework for height (10m), exposure, and averaging period (Powell et al., 1996). Given its versatile inputs, the H*Wind products are considered to be among the most sophisticated and reliable surface wind reconstructions. A third approach, which is the parametric approach, is favored for its simplicity and lower coast that are vital for timely operational forecasting. In this approach, the surface wind field of a TC can be estimated as the sum of the storm vortex winds and the background winds of the environment. The vortex winds are usually depicted by a radial wind profile, whose formula is either derived from the gradient or cyclostrophic wind balance equation, or simply an empirical expression acquired from historical storm events. The background winds are of a much larger scale, and among other factors, are responsible for steering the movement of a TC (Shapiro, 1983) and considered to account for some of the asymmetry observed in the overall wind field. Currently, there is no clear consensus on how to determine the distribution of background winds due to insufficient observational data. In many applications, it was common to set the background winds equal to the storm's translational velocity \u20d7\u20d7\u20d7\u20d7 (e.g., Powell et al., 2005;Mattocks and Forbes, 2008), while in many others, the background winds were assumed to be in the same direction as \u20d7\u20d7\u20d7\u20d7 but with reduced magnitudes by various factors (e.g., radially varies between 0-0.5 by Jelesnianski et al., 1992, Phadke et al., 2003azimuthally varies between 0-0.5 by Georgiou, 1985, andXie et al., 2006;constant 0.6 by Emanuel et al., 2006; constant 0.5 by Lin et al., 2012a). Lin and Chavas (2012b) introduced a methodology via vector decomposition of H*Wind surface wind fields to investigate the relationship between the surface background winds and \u20d7\u20d7\u20d7\u20d7 , and found that statistically the surface background winds are reduced by a factor of = 0.55 and rotated counter-clockwise (in the Northern Hemisphere) by an angle of = 20\u00b0 relative to \u20d7\u20d7\u20d7\u20d7 . The classic Holland Model (HM, 1980) is one of most commonly used analytical vortex models, which is also one of the meteorological forcing options in the ADCIRC storm surge model (NWS = 19). A thorough look at its formulation reveals that the HM suffers a few flaws due to the assumptions made during its derivation. Development of a more generalized Holland Model is presented in Chapter 2."}, {"section_title": "Surface Wind Stress and Drag Coefficient", "text": "When wind blows over the open water, it exerts a shear stress at the water surface that transfers horizontal momentum vertically downward across the air-sea interface, driving the upper-ocean circulation, non-tidal sea surface elevation fluctuation, and formation of the surface wind waves. Thus, an accurate estimate of the surface wind stress is crucial to atmospheric, storm surge, and wave modeling. In common practice, the surface wind stress in storm surge model is parameterized using the bulk formula where is the density of air, is the surface drag coefficient, and \u20d7 \u20d7\u20d1 10 is the wind speed at 10m height. Assuming neutral stability, the mathematical representation of the mean wind velocity profile within the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) is given by the logarithmic where is the wind speed at height , is the von Karman constant (determined experimentally to be ~0.40), 0 is the surface roughness length, and * is the friction velocity defined by (1.3) Charnock (1955) proposed that a simple non-dimensional relation exists between 0 and * where is the so-called Charnock constant, typically ranging from 0.015 to 0.035 depending on different sea state, and is the acceleration due to gravity. Here, sea state refers to the general condition of the ocean surface with respect to wave characteristics such as wave height, period, or wave spectrum at a given time and location. Based on Eqs. 1.1~1.4, can be rewritten as (1.5) The drag coefficient therefore can be regarded as a measure of the roughness of the sea, and is influenced by many factors such as the wind speed, atmospheric stability, and sea state, etc."}, {"section_title": "Reviews of Commonly Used Surface Drag Laws", "text": "Many approaches have been developed to estimate the surface wind stress \u20d1 (or described in terms of surface roughness 0 or surface drag coefficient ).

Wind measurements under hurricane wind forcing were made available via the use of the Global Positioning System (GPS) dropsondes. Powell et al. (2003, hereinafter P03) analyzed 331 GPS dropsonde data from 15 storms (1997)(1998)(1999) and concluded that, contrary to previous thoughts, tends to level off around ~34 m/s and then decrease with increasing wind speed, possibly due to air-flow separation and the existence of sea spay and white-capping at high winds. Laboratory tank measurements by Donelan et al. (2004) and theoretical studies by Soloviev et al. (2014) predicted a similar behavior of to drop off at high wind speeds. To adopt these new findings, a cap value can be simply applied to existing formulas to represent the leveling off of at high wind speeds. In ADCIRC, Garratt's formula is typically capped at 2.5 \u00d7 10 \u22123 or 3.5 \u00d7 10 \u22123 . A more sophisticated approach is to fit a polynomial curve to capture the leveling off and then decreasing of at high wind speeds, such as the GFDL14 drag law used in the GFDL hurricane model, and SWAN-FIT, the 2 nd order polynomial implemented in SWAN (Zijlema et al., 2012) as an alternative to Wu's linear formula.

Their results indicate that varies differently with wind speed in different storm-relative sectors, as shown in Figure 3.3: 1) In the rear sector (151 -240\u00b0), is fairly constant and decreases at wind speed above 34 m/s, 2) In the right sector (20 -150\u00b0), is relatively constant with wind speed, but a slight increase was suggested at wind speed above 45 m/s, and 3) In the front left sector (241 -20\u00b0), is the most sensitive to wind speed, and increases to a maximum value of 4.7 \u00d7 10 \u22123 at wind speed of 36 m/s and then decreases rapidly at higher winds. Powell's findings contradicted numerical modeling results by Moon et al. (2004), who estimated a higher in the right and front of the storm where longer, higher, and more fully developed waves dominate, and a lower in the rear and left of the storm with shorter and younger waves. It is recommended that further investigations be conducted in light of this inconsistency.

To resolve this issue, Ho12 proposed to grade swell type continuously using the wave directional spreading variable DSPR , which by definition accounts for the swell in proportion to its energy relative to the energy of local windsea. DSPR is defined as (in analogy with the definition of standard deviation): where is the wave direction elative to the mean wave direction, and the operator \u2329 \u232a represents the average over spectral direction weighted with wave energy density (Battjes, 1972).

Consider a pure windsea with a single spectral peak, free of contamination from swell. The windsea usually has a universal spectral shape that results from the coupled system of wind, wind waves, and surface currents. Therefore, the local windsea can be characterized by the phase velocity at the spectral peak , and similarly, the momentum flux through the coupled system can be characterized by * or | \u20d7 \u20d7\u20d1 10 |. Thus, it is possible to represent the developmental stage of the sea with a dimensionless \"wave age\" \u2044 * or | \u20d7 \u20d7\u20d1 10 | \u2044 . Older waves that travel close to the wind speed do not contribute much drag; while younger waves are the main rough elements. Thus, wave age is a plausible candidate to describe the sea surface roughness. Kitaigorodskii and Volkov (1965) made the first attempt to relate sea surface roughness to the sea state, and proposed that the Charnock's constant depends on wave age. Since that, numerous efforts have been made in the field and laboratories to find the relation between 0 and \u2044 * , but no definitive conclusions have been reached (e.g., Geernaert 1986;Toba et al. 1990;Smith et al. 1992;Donelan et al. 1993;Oost et al. 2002;Drennan et al. 2003). Part of the problem lies in the fact that by definition both 0 and wave age depend on * , which could lead to potential spurious correlations between these two variables (Kenney, 1982). To eliminate the issue, Drennan et al. (2003, hereinafter D03) combined five datasets of different sources that represent a variety of wind-wave conditions, and concluded that a power-law relation exist between 0 \u2044 and the inverse wave age where is the significant wave height. Equation (1.9) implies that younger waves are rougher than older waves. Note that for wind-waves in local equilibrium with the wind, there is a strong statistical interdependence between the variables in (1.9) Thus, the extent to which the wave agedependent formula differs from or has in common with the conventional wind speed-dependent formula under different wind-wave conditions is a question that needs to be answered. Also, a clear wave age-dependent surface drag has not been observed in open ocean under hurricane wind forcing, so we should be cautious to use it in storm surge modeling. Hsu (1974) took a different path to relate surface roughness to the sea state, and suggested that 0 depended on the wave slope \u2044 , where is the wavelength of waves at the peak frequency. Using measurements from three field experiments, Taylor and Yelland (2001, hereinafter TY01) proposed a wave steepness-dependent formula, which predicts a power law relation between the dimensionless roughness 0 \u2044 and steepness of the dominant waves 0 \u2044 = 1200( \u2044 ) 4.5 . (1.10) Using this formula, the roughness changes due to fetch or duration limitations are small. Equation (1.10) reconciles many observations that previously had appeared scattered, except for data corresponding to very young waves. Drennan et al. (2005) evaluated both D03 and TY01 using eight assembled datasets, and found that these two methods yielded rather different estimates of roughness depending on the sea states. Each method has its own merits and limitations: 1) in conditions with a dominant wind sea, both methods yield better estimates than the traditional bulk formula, 2) in general conditions with mixed sea, the steepness method performs better, 3) for underdeveloped younger wind sea, the wave age method yields better results, and 4) for swell-dominated conditions, neither methods did well. Implementation of both methods does not require explicit knowledge of the wave spectrum."}, {"section_title": "Explicit Surface Wind Stress", "text": "Wave field associated with a hurricane is rather complex both in space and time due to the translational nature of a hurricane and the curvature of the winds, an explicit parameterization of surface wind stress that depends on the 2D wave spectrum is desired. We hope that by incorporating the 2D wave spectrum (both the long wave spectrum and short wave spectrum tail) into the stress formulations, more physics can be captured to explain the large amount of scatters in the surface drag measurements. Since the pioneering work on wind wave evolution by Miles (1957) and Phillips (1958), considerable efforts have been made to study the spectral shape and equilibrium range of wind waves. The most important contribution on the shape of wave spectrum comes from the JOint North Sea WAve Project (JONSWAP, Hasselmann et al., 1973), in which a universal spectral shape (normalized over spectral peak) was found for waves in idealized fetched-limited, deep water conditions. Waves in the equilibrium range are quasi-saturated, meaning that their slope is limited by breaking and does not increase much with wind speed. Up until now, our knowledge of the wave spectrum in the equilibrium range is still limited, especially under high wind conditions. There is debate over the shape of the high frequency spectral tail, but the \u22125 tail (Phillips, 1958;Pierson and Moskowitz, 1964;JONSWAP, Hasselmann et al., 1973) and the \u22124 tail (Toba, 1973;Donelan et al., 1985;Hwang et al., 2000) are most widely used. Note, wave spectra in wavenumber space and in frequency space can be inter-changed using straightforward Jacobian transformations. The \u22124 tail corresponding to the \u22125 tail in frequency spectrum is most often used in a wavenumber spectrum. Numerical wave models typically resolve wave spectrum to a certain frequency, and an empirical tail needs to be attached to extend the spectrum to high frequency range. Based on conservation of momentum in the marine boundary layer, Janssen (1989) and later Chalikov and Makin (1991) introduced a theory that takes into account the directional wavenumber spectrum \u03a8( , ) to describe the exchange of momentum at the air-sea interface, where \u03a8( , ) is defined as (1.11) with 2 \u0305\u0305\u0305 being the mean square surface displacement. The total stress is supported by both the turbulent motions of the air and the wave-induced motions due to the wind waves At the sea surface = 0 the total flux equals to the sum of the viscous stress \u2261 (0) and form stress \u2261 (0). The viscous stress comes through the direct molecular interaction at the surface, and can be calculated from the law of smooth wall, with viscous drag coefficient adjusted for the sheltering effect in the presence of waves (Donelan et al., 2012), and the form stress is given by the rate of change of wave momentum in time due to the wind source input To characterize the input rate of momentum from the atmosphere to waves, here we define where \u20d7\u20d1 is the pressure exerted on the water surface by wind, and ( , ) is the wave growth rate. Parameterization of ( , ) varies in different studies. Assuming dispersion relation 2 = , the wave momentum is given by (Phillips, 1977) where is the density of water, and is the wave frequency. Combining Eqs. (1.13~1.15), the form drag can be expressed as In a fully developed sea, waves near the spectral peak propagate close to the wind speed and thus do not contribute much form drag to the total stress. Intuitively, the rough elements of the form drag in this situation come from the steep shorter waves in the spectral tail. The flaw of these types of model is that the form drag calculated using (1.16) is very sensitive to the high frequency tail, and there is little known about the spectral tail under hurricane wind conditions. Both the RHG and DCCM are explicit momentum flux models. Their description and model implementation in the coupled ADCIRC+SWAN will be carried out in Chapter 3 (along with other described drag laws in Section 1.3). Investigation of different drag laws on storm surge modeling will also be conducted."}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER 2: DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION OF A GENERALIZED", "text": "ASYMMETRIC HOLLAND VORTEX MODEL"}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "There are many kinds of parametric wind models exist, which use similar sets of storm parameters but distinct methods to offer TC pressure and wind estimates. One example is the SLOSH (Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges from Hurricanes, Jelesnianski et al., 1992) wind model, which is among the most important features of the SLOSH storm surge model currently used by the National Weather Service (NWS) for storm surge guidance. The SLOSH describes a circularly-symmetric storm vortex superimposed upon the background winds calculated from \u20d7\u20d7\u20d7\u20d7 . It takes the radius to maximum wind (RMW) and central pressure deficit as its key model inputs, and first estimates the maximum wind empirically and then solves for the pressure and wind fields. Houston et al. (1999) did a model comparison between analyzed wind observations and the SLOSH modeled winds for seven cases in five hurricanes, and found that the SLOSH underestimated the peak winds by 15% in Hurricane Emily (1993), and by 6% or less in the rest cases. Also, the mean wind speed and mean inflow angle for the SLOSH winds were 14% stronger and 19\u00b0 less than those observed in the region of strongest winds. Another example is the classic Holland Model (1980, hereafter HM), which is a pressurewind relationship model that features two shape parameters A and B in its radial pressure and wind profile equations. By assuming a cyclostrophic balance in the region of maximum winds, where the Coriolis force is negligible compared to the pressure gradient and centripetal force in the gradient wind equation, the RMW is found to be entirely defined by A and B, independent of the central pressure deficit and the maximum wind. It is logical to speculate that the cyclostrophic assumption is only reasonable when the Rossby number ( , which is a dimensionless number relating the ratio of nonlinear accelerations to the Coriolis force) at the RMW is large (details given in section 2.2.2). A great feature of the HM is that both A and B, as well as the RMW if it is absent from model inputs, can be readily derived from a limited set of wind observations, or determined climtologically for a standard hurricane. This feature is extremely useful when the RMW is not available at the time of forecasting. For example, in the event of a TC, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) issues forecast advisories every six hours to update the current and future (forecasts made for 12, 24, 36, and 72 hours from the current synoptic time) storm location, the central pressure, the observed maximum sustained wind, the radii to the specified 34-, 50-, and 64-kt storm isotachs in each of the NorthEast (NE), SoutEast (SE), SouthWest (SW), and NorthWest (NW) storm quadrants, etc. Based on the radius to a specified isotach in one quadrant, the RMW can be solved by fitting the isotach data to the HM's wind profile via a root-finding algorithm. The HM uses an azimuthally constant RMW to construct its axis-symmetrical wind field. Given their simplicity and reasonable forecasting skill, the HM and its variants have been used extensively for operational forecasting of TC winds over the past few decades. Willoughby and Rahn (2004) evaluated the HM by comparing the statistically fitted HM profiles with wind observations measured by the Hurricane Research Division (HRD) aircraft, and concluded that the HM suffers from two systematic errors: 1) The areas of strong winds in the eyewall and of nearly calm winds at the vortex center are too wide, and 2) the wind decreases too rapidly with distance from the maximum wind, both inside and outside the eye. To address these issues, Willoughby et al. (2006, WM) proposed a new family of sectionally continuous profiles that allow the wind to increase in proportion to a power of radius inside the eye and decay exponentially outside the eye with a smooth transition in between. Unlike the HM, which is a pressure-wind relationship model, the WM calculates the geopotential height of a given pressure through an outward integration of the gradient wind acceleration. The storm parameters featured in the WM, including the exponent for the power law inside the eye, and a single-(dual-) exponential decay length(s) outside the eye, were derived using lease square fits based on a sample of 493 observed profiles, and accurate estimation of these parameters require ample wind data both inside and outside the storm eye. The WM's wind profile was shown to fit historical wind observations more accurately. However, in the event of a TC when only limited storm information is available at the time of forecasting, statistically fitted parameters from historical TC events might not lead to an optimum fit to each individual storm. Since the 1980s, extensive reconnaissance aircraft data have became more widely available due to the advantage of modern technology. The extended dataset led Holland et al. (2010, hereafter HM10) develop a revised version to the classic HM by: 1) allowing a linearly varying exponent in the wind equation to better fit inner and outer wind observations made at any level; and 2) adding a secondary wind maxima with specified magnitude and range to the primary winds to accommodate more complex wind profiles. The HM10 showed improvements over the classic HM to achieve better fit to the hurricane reconnaissance data for a range of North Atlantic hurricanes. However, its application in real TC cases requires an accurate estimate of the RMW as input during the time of forecasting, which might not be available, at least in the NHC's forecast advisories. Another attempt was made by Wood et al. (2013, hereafter WW13) to extend the existing tangential wind model of Wood and White (2011) and tailor it for TC application. The WW13 proposed a partitioned TC wind profile that was able to render as many as three wind maxima during an Eye Replacement Cycle (ERC). It features five key storm parameters in each of its primary, secondary, and tertiary tangential wind formulations: the RMW, the maximum wind, and three shape parameters including the growth parameter , and the decay parameter , and the size parameter . Each intuitive shape parameter has its unique physical meaning and acts independently in controlling different portions of the wind profile. In the WW13, the gradient wind is readily derived from the cyclostrophic wind in terms of the cyclostrophic Rossby number , and the total pressure profile is partitioned into different components corresponded with the multi-maxima wind profile, calculated via cyclostrophic balance. It was noted that the WW13 was optimized to define a relatively peaked TC with a large that typically ranging from 10 to 100 (Willoughby, 1990;Willoughby and Rahn, 2004). For a TC with a relatively broad profile and less than 10, the RMW was often found to be displaced towards the TC center, and both the RMW and the maximum wind needed to be mathematically adjusted. The WW13 showed sophistication in obtaining optimum fit to known radial profiles, but it also requires an accurate estimate of the RMW as input data to accomplish that, which may render it inconvenient for operational forecasting. Naturally, there is considerable variability in the estimated surface wind fields constructed with different parametric wind models. Up until now, there is not much consensus on which model is better than the others considering different aspects and the available datasets being used in each scenario. Although the HM suffers from systematic errors as discussed earlier, its simple formulation, and most importantly, its relaxation on requiring an accurate RMW as input data allow the HM to be widely used for operational forecasting. Based on the HM, Xie et al. (2006) developed a real-time hurricane surface wind forecasting system that is characterized by an azimuthally-varying RMW for better depicting surface wind structure of an asymmetric TC such as a land falling hurricane, a.k.a. the asymmetric Holland model (AHM). Using radii to the highest isotach (34, 50, or 64 kt) in each of the 4 storm quadrants, the RMW is calculated in each quadrant and then fitted azimuthally around the storm center via a polynomial interpolation. Mattocks et al. 2006implemented Xie's work in the ADCIRC model (Luettich, Westerink, and Scheffner, 1991;Westerink et al., 1992) and uses the coupled model for real-time storm surge and wave forecasting for the state of North Carolina. This operational system has many advantages: 1) it allows an ocean simulation to be launched as soon as an NHC forecast advisory is issued, usually hours before other numerical wind products become available, 2) a synthetic wind field is computed on the fly at each time step during the entire simulation period, and 3) by varying storm parameters, such as storm track or storm forwarding speed, a series of ensemble members of forecasts for strategic assessment of coastal emergencies can be provided. As an improved application of the HM, the AHM works great for intense but relatively narrow TCs with a large , for which the cyclostrophic assumption made at the RMW is valid. However, for a generally weak but broad TC, or a strong TC at its developing or dissipating stages, the AHM is inferior as the Coriolis force is no longer negligible at the RMW. Cases like these will mostly lead to underestimations of the peak winds, as well as unrealistic wind profiles in the AHM. The goal of this study was to improve the AHM and to develop a Generalized proposes future work for further improvement of the GAHM.\nIn contrast to land surface that is static or evolving slowly over long time scales (e.g., evolution of coastal sand dunes or vegetation coverage), surface water waves develop over short time scales under atmospheric forcings. If winds persist over a large enough fetch, the wave field evolves and reaches equilibrium. Under a transient weather system like a hurricane, the wave field is under-developed, and is rather complicated in different sectors of the storm. Also, when wind speed is high enough, the air-sea interface becomes a foam, bubble, spray layer and will affect the surface roughness of the sea, effectively making the surface more \"slippery\". Quantifying exactly how much momentum is transferred under various conditions has been studied for decades."}, {"section_title": "Model Description", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "The classic Holland Model (1980)", "text": "As the development of GAHM in this study is based on the classic HM (1980), a brief derivation of HM's formulations is presented below. To start with, the surface pressure profile in HM is approximated by a rectangular hyperbolic equation and is given as where is the pressure at radius , is the central pressure, is the ambient pressure, A and B are scaling parameters that can be estimated empirically from observations. Substituting (2.1) into the gradient wind equation yields an equation for the gradient wind profile: where is the gradient wind at radius , is the base of natural logarithm, \u03c1 is the density of air, is the Coriolis term, = 2 sin( ), and is the rotational frequency of the earth.

Based on (2.4) and (2.5), re-organizing the pressure and wind equations gives the final pressure and wind profiles (2.7) Attempts were made to fit wind observations to the surface wind profile using (2.7), however, discrepancies between observed and modeled winds were found negatively correlated to the Rossby number at the RMW (2.8) The larger the 0 , the smaller the discrepancies (more discussions will be given later). By definition, a large 0 (\u2248 10 3 ) specifies a system in cyclostrophic balance that is dominated by inertial and centrifugal forces with negligible Coriolis force, such as a tornado or the inner core of an intense hurricane, while a small value (\u2248 10 \u22122~1 0 2 ) signifies a system in geostrophic balance that is strongly influenced by the Coriolis force, such as the outer region of a TC. Thus, the cyclostrophic balance assumption made in the HM is valid for describing an intense but narrow TC with a large , but not suitable for a weak but broad TC with a small . This intrinsic problem of HM calls our attention to develop the GAHM that would consistently work with a wide range of TCs, and theoretically this could be accomplished by eliminating the assumption of the cyclostrophic balance at the RMW in the GAHM."}, {"section_title": "Derivation of GAHM's Formulas", "text": "Following the HM, the pressure profile in the GAHM is likewise approximated by a rectangular hyperbolic equation, given by (2.1), and the wind profile is obtained by substituting (2.1) into the gradient wind equation, given by (2.2).

To have a dissective look of the results shown in Figure 2.2, slices drawn perpendicular to the axis of log 10 at three selected values 0, 1.0, and 2.0, are shown in Figure 2.3. It is well noted that the GAHM performs consistently well in obtaining = at = , regardless of how changes. On the other hand, the HM tends to generate distorted wind profiles with the maximum winds skewed inward towards the storm center and underestimated, yielding faulty results of the modeled maximum wind and the RMW. Specifically, underestimation in modeled maximum wind is clear (more than 10%) when log 10 < 1, and misrepresentation of the RMW is larger for a smaller . As a result, when both models are applied in real cases, the GAHM is analytically more precise than the HM and can ensure a better match between the observed and the modeled winds.

With estimated and the RMW, (2.12) and (2.13) give the radial pressure and wind profiles of a vortex at the same gradient wind level. When adjusting the gradient wind speeds to the standard surface reference level over the ocean of 10m MSL (mean sea level), the boundary layer effect must be considered, including the scalar reduction in wind speed, wind inflow towards the center of the vortex due to frictions, and asymmetry of TC surface wind structure due to the storm forward motion, etc. As a standard procedure, the quadrant-varying and the RMW are pre-computed in the ASWIP program (an external FORTRAN program initially written by Flemming et al and further developed in this study to accommodate the GAHM) prior to running an ADCIRC simulation forced with the GAHM wind model. First, the maximum sustained wind and the winds of 34-, 50-, and 64-kt isotachs in NHC's forecast or \"best track\" advisories, normally reported at 10m height, must be corrected to the gradient wind level to remove the influence of the boundary layer effect. Practically, the maximum gradient wind is calculated as where is the reported maximum sustained wind speed at the 10m level, is the storm translational speed calculated from successive storm center locations, is the damp factor for , and is the wind reduction factor for reducing wind speed from the gradient wind level to the surface (Powell et al. 2003). There are several forms of exist in the literature, while in this study, the following form was employed which is the ratio of gradient wind to the maximum wind along a radial profile. Thus, is zero at storm center, increases to a maximum of 1 at the RMW (where = ), and gradually decreases outward to zero. Due to vertical stability differences, variability over the range of 0.7 to 0.9 for is considered to be reasonable, and a constant 0.9 is applied in this study.

Occasionally, we have to deal with situations where < after subtracting the storm translation speed from maximum sustained wind and storm isotach, which usually happens on the right hand side (in the Northern Atmosphere) of a relatively weak fast-moving TC.

Previous studies show that a single vortex generated by parametric wind models might not be able to represent the complex structure of a TC, and the AHM falls into this category since it uses storm information of the highest isotach only. To take advantage of all available isotachs in NHC's forecast or \"best track\" advisories, an additional feature was added to the GAHM. The GAHM uses a composite wind method to interpolate storm parameters calculated along four quadrant lines onto the entire ADCIRC grid. Given the longitude and latitude of the storm center at time , the relative location of a grid node to the vortex center is calculated, specified by azimuth angle and distance . The angle places the node between two adjacent quadrant lines and + 1, where For each storm parameter, including the RMW, the and , its composite value at ( , ) are weighted between a pair of pseudo values at ( ( ), ) and ( After RMW, and are interpolated at ( , ), the scaling factor can be calculated via (2.11), and the pressure and gradient wind at the node i can be calculated from (2.12) and (2.13). The above procedures are performed at each single node of an ADCIRC grid. Once the pressure and gradient wind fields are calculated at the gradient wind level, they are reduced to the standard 10m reference level to reflect the influence of the boundary layer effect: first, the wind reduction factor is applied to reduce the magnitude of the scalar wind; then the tangential winds are rotated by an inward flow angle according to (2.19); and last, the storm translational speed \u20d7\u20d7\u20d7\u20d7\u20d7 is added to the vortex winds. This new composite wind method is simple and efficient, and more importantly, it assures that the constructed surface wind field is fully consistent with all available wind isotachs provided in NHC's forecast or \"best track\" advisories during the life cycle of a TC. Evaluation of this composite method will be conducted in Section 2.5.

The left (right) three panels show cross-section winds from the SW to the NE (the NW to the SE) directions, and all specified isotachs (34, 50, and/or 64-knot) in the \"best track\" file are plotted in vertical bars at specified distances from the storm center, with the highest one in a dark color and the rest in gray. For a perfect match between the isotachs and the modeled winds, the tip of the vertical bars and the radial profiles must meet at the exact heights. Radial wind profiles produced by the GAHM perfectly match the highest isotachs in all quadrants at all time, no matter how and vary, indicating a high model consistency of the GAHM approach. When 10 > 1, profiles of the AHM generally show good agreement with the highest isotach and are quite similar to those by the GAHM (see the SE and SW quadrants in the first snapshot), and all four quadrants in the second snapshot. When 10 < 1, the AHM fails to match any highest isotach due to the issues detailed in section 2.2.1 (see the rest of the quadrants). Note that profiles by either the AHM or the GAHM tend to die off too quickly away from the storm center, and thus fail to match any lower isotach.

This is particularly common for a weak but fast moving storm, and cautions should be taken when subtracting the storm's translational speed from the specified maximum wind and isotachs, as the adjusted maximum wind might sometimes be smaller than certain isotach winds in certain quadrants (especially the quadrants with opposing winds to the storm's forward motion). When such violations occur, the maximum wind will be adjusted accordingly to match the given isotach wind, which is equivalent to setting RMW to the radius to the specified isotach in these violating quadrants.

In fact, underestimation of modeled winds at distances to isotachs other than the highest one was common, as the computed wind profile tended to die off too quickly away from the storm center due to the nature of GAHM's formulas. In an effort to minimize the combined error at distances to all available isotachs, and to improve the accuracy of the overall estimated wind field to a further spatial extent, the multiple-isotach approach, which is based on the composite wind method introduced in section 2.2.4, should be used whenever there is more than one isotach present in the best track file. The 3D snapshot of Irene's radial wind profiles (left) and the interpolated spatial wind field (right) at the corresponding time by the GAHM using the single-isotach approach (upper two panels), and those using the multiple-isotach approach (lower two panels) is given ( Figure   2.9).

In each wind snapshot, the azimuthal RMW surrounding the storm center was calculated from the spatial wind field and shown by the black circle, and the 34-, 50-, and 64-kt isotachs are shown by the gray circles. It was suggested that during weaker periods of a hurricane, the AHM and the GAHM calculate quite different RMWs, causing them to have quite distinctive spatial wind fields. In general, the calculated RMW in the AHM is closer to the storm center than in the GAHM, due to the cyclostrophic balance assumption made at the RMW in the AHM's formula. However, during stronger periods when there are multiple isotachs available in the \"Best Track\" file, the GAHM wind fields show similarity with the AHM wind fields in the inner region of the hurricane, but difference in the outer region due to the multiple-isotach approach used in the GAHM to generate its composite wind field. The SLOSH wind fields show a lot of dissimilarity when compared to the AHM and GAHM wind fields, since it uses an azimuthally constant RMW to generate its vortex wind and a distance-weighted translational speed to account for storm asymmetry. Problems arise when vortex winds are much stronger than the translational speed of the hurricane, see SLOSH wind field in the middle row of Figure 11, as the asymmetry could not be rendered properly. There were a lot of details in surface wind fields of the H*Wind and OWI winds, but the parametric wind fields were rather simple. Although it is unlikely that the parametric winds, constructed over a minimum set of data, will ever match the level of details and complexity in the re-analysis H*Wind and the numerical OWI winds, however, the ability of a parametric model to produce reasonable estimates of surface wind fields in a timely manner was highly desirable in the field of real-time applications. Evaluations of the modeled maximum wind and the RMW are shown in Figure 2.11. The distributions of the maximum winds identified in H*Wind, OWI winds, or SLOSH winds versus the specified maximum winds were rather dispersed, but the scatters is close to the 1:1 (dash) line, indicating a fairly good correlation, shown in upper panels. It is reasonable that the maximum winds reported in the \"best track\" advisories, which were approximated by experienced forecasters based on limited information, naturally may not match the maximum winds perfectly in the re-analysis H*Wind and numerical OWI winds.

Considering all seven hurricanes, the overall model consistency evaluated at distances to all available specified isotach is shown in Figure 2.13, with statistics given in Table 2.3. The GAHM has almost perfect match to each of the 34-, 50-, and 64-kt isotachs, with a standard deviation generally around 0.1 kt, which is very impressive. The SLOSH does not take isotach information to construct its wind fields, thus behaves poorly by overestimating the 64-kt isotach by 5.5 kts and underestimating the 34-and 50-knot isotachs by 4.0 and 1.1 kts. It also has the widest data spread, with standard deviations > 11 kts at all specified isotachs. For the H*Wind and the OWI winds, the modeled mean wind speeds are close to each specified isotach, generally within \u00b13 kts, but the spreads of data are also large compared to the AHM and the GAHM, with a standard deviation of greater than 7 kts.   Wood et al. (2013) and many others, a criteria of 10 < 1 can be identified to consider a wind flow gradient, instead of cyclostrophic, and the GAHM should be used under this circumstance to avoid distortion in the calculated RMW and maximum winds, and the overall spatial wind field. Another important feature of the GAHM is the introducing of a composite wind method, which allows the GAHM to utilize multiple storm isotachs to construct wind field validated at given radii. It ensures consistency of modeled winds when-and wherever wind observations were provided. Evaluation of GAHM was carried out using seven selected hurricanes that struck the U.S. East Coast and the Gulf of Mexico in the past decade. Examination of modeled winds at distances to all available isotachs and the radius to maximum wind suggested that the GAHM was able to produce surface wind fields that consistently matched the NHC's advisory data. Comparison between the modeled maximum wind and RMW with the \"Best Track\" data in relation to the also indicated that the GAHM is superior to the AHM in yielding truthful results without being influenced by the significance of the Coriolis force in the weather system. Comparison between the parametric model results and the more validated OWI and H*Wind enlightened us to use the data in the NHC's \"best track\" file more objectively and cautiously, and to think twice weather our methodology was reasonable to assume the storm information in 4 storm quadrants are along 4 fixed azimuthal angles. As a prototype for parametric wind forecasting, the GAHM was designed to interpret storm information in NHC's forecast/best track advisories to construct a composite wind field. In theory, winds observed anywhere within the influential range of a hurricane could be synthesized into the final wind field to improve model accuracy. Future work could be taken to improve the GAHM so that it can sophisticatedly assimilate wind data from other sources to yield better representation of the realistic wind fields."}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER 3: EXPLICIT SURFACE WIND STRESS UNDER TROPICAL CYCLONES FOR STORM SURGE MODELING", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "RHG and DCCM", "text": "To investigate the impact of surface wave field on surface wind stress in fetch-dependent seas, Reichl et al. (2014) conducted numerical experiments to examine the influence of sea state on surface momentum flux using two wave-dependent stress calculation methods, the RHG (a modified version of Moon et al., 2004, with added influence of swell on wave growth rate), and the DCCM (Donelan et al., 2012). There are two major differences between the RHG and DCCM. One is the calculation of wave growth rate. While both RHG and DCCM uses (14) to evaluate its form drag at the surface = 0, they calculate ( , ) quite differently. The RHG parameterizes ( , ) from the turbulent stress at the inner layer height = \u2044 (Hara and Belcher, 2004), where the parameter is empirically adjusted to match the resulting total drag coefficient to observations at low to moderate wind speeds (in this study = 0.03). For wave propagating perpendicular to wind, ( , ) is set to 0. The DCCM parameterizes ( , ) from the wind speed; waves propagating at large angles relative to wind speed contribute significantly to the form drag, effectively increasing the misalignment between total stress and wind speed. Another major difference is the calculation of the wind profile. The RHG considers energy conservation inside the wave boundary layer. It assumes the wind shear is aligned with the turbulent stress at all heights, meaning that the wind speed vector can turn with height within the wave boundary layer. The DCCM, on the other hand, does not explicitly consider energy conservation in the wave boundary layer. In fact, it assumes the wind profile follows a logarithmic \"law of the wall\" profile, meaning that the wind speed vector is fixed in direction. Thus, the wind and stress can be significantly misaligned. See Reichl et al. (2014) for more mathematical details of the RHG and DCCM. The wave spectra used in Reichl's study were simulated using WAVEWATCH III (hereinafter WWIII, Tolman, 2009). WWIII is a third generation wave model developed at the National Center for Environmental Predictions (NCEP) for operational use. It simulates the evolution of wind waves by accounting for the wind source input, nonlinear wave-wave interaction, wave dissipation (\"whitecapping\") in deep water, and additional wave shoaling and breaking processes in shallow water. The WWIII has its own parameterization and wave growth rate parameterization, the latter of which being empirically adjusted to produce wave spectra that agree well observations mostly at low to moderate winds. Note, the feedback of the wave-dependent stress on wave simulations was not pursued in Reichl's study. The WWIII resolves wave spectrum explicitly up to 3 \u00d7 the peak input frequency , and internally attaches an empirical high-frequency spectral tail. A few constant saturation tail levels for ( ) were tested in Reichl's study, including a low ( = 2 \u00d7 10 \u22123 ), a medium ( = 6 \u00d7 10 \u22123 ), and a high value ( = 12 \u00d7 10 \u22123 ), where ( ) = \u03a8( ) 4 is the directionally integrated saturation spectrum and is assumed to be constant over k at the high frequency tail. The model simulated spectrum was used up to 1.25 \u00d7 , then linearly transitioned to the constant tail level B from 1.25 \u00d7 to 3 \u00d7 (Figure 3.1). Once the wave spectra were constructed, total momentum flux from the atmosphere to the ocean was calculated using both the RHG and DCCM methods. It was found that the computed is very sensitive to the spectral tail level used, but is not as sensitive to the stress calculation methods. This is the consequence of the fact that the wave induced stress is mainly supported by the high frequency part of the spectrum. Also, it was found that no single value could produce to agree well with observations such as the COARE 3.5 (Edson et al. 2013) at its entire wind speed range. If the spectral tail level is not set as constant, but as a function of wind speed, wave age, or both, technically can be constructed to match any observations or any analytical functions. It reminds us that certain physical processes that affect the surface wind stress might be missing.

Since most observations under hurricane conditions were made over deep water, our knowledge of the surface drag mechanisms under hurricane forcings in shallow water is still limited.

We are interested to find out if sea state dependent behaves differently in shallow water than in deep water under hurricane wind conditions. Currently, the operational ADCIRC storm surge model has two options when specifying the wind drag coefficient: 1) the wind speed-dependent by Garratt (1977), and b) the storm sector-dependent by Powell (2007). In an effort to address the uncertainties in different surface drag estimates and their effect on storm surge modeling, we implemented the above mentioned approaches in the coupled ADCIRC and SWAN model in this study for comparisons (Table 3.1).

Here we want to study the sensitivity of the surface drag to different spectral tail parameterizations, as well as to the prognostic wave spectrum simulated using different physics packages in SWAN, under various wind and wave regimes. Waves in shallow water are much more complex than in deep water, as they suffer from shoaling, depth-induced breaking, and other physical processes approaching the shore. We speculate that the surface wind stress in shallow water is higher than in deep water, as waves slow down, become steeper and higher, and ultimately break, essentially increasing the aerodynamic roughness of the sea surface.

The total stress will be passed to ADCIRC to provide atmospheric forcing. It is important to note that a strong assumption is often made for the boundary condition in storm surge modeling: the surface wind stress equals to the ocean stress, which is the downward flux of momentum from the air into the currents. This assumption is valid for fully developed seas, in other words, the wave field is neither growing nor decaying. This assumption does not hold in transient weather systems such as hurricanes. When strongly forced by the wind, growing waves act like a giant momentum reservoir, effectively reducing the momentum flux from the air to the ocean currents. On the other hand, decaying waves release wave momentum to the current and effectively increase the ocean stress. In this study, we simply assume that the atmospheric stress equals to the ocean stress.

More importantly, the modeled saturation levels begin to diverge even before 3 \u00d7 .

Last but not least, we compared the spatial distribution of and between two tail options in both deep and shallow water. With Reichl's empirical tail, behavior of is quite consistent among different physics packages for both deep and shallow water conditions. The extended tail option is rather problematic at producing reasonable at high wind speeds, especially for shallow water. It is possible that a \u22124 tail that is commonly used for deep water is no longer suitable for shallow water, in which further research is needed. Reichl's empirical tail is recommended to use in both RHG and DCCM for consistent performances.\nEffects of different surface drag laws on storm surge predictions were investigated using Hurricane Irene 2011 in this section. We compared the spatial patterns of among different drag laws, and found that while each drag law has its own characteristics, similarities can be found among a few. Reichl's empirical tail was used in both RHG and DCCM as it provides a more consistent model performance. When using Reichl's empirical tail option, little sea state dependency of were found in RHG and DCCM, which contradicts the findings by Powell and Ho12. There could be a few explanations: 1) in the resolved part of the spectrum, influence of different types of swell (following, crossing, or opposing) on the surface wind stress is underaddressed; 2) the use of a wind speed-dependent spectral tail is inadequate as it does not contribute to sea state dependency of , and 3) important physics such as wave breaking and sea spray are missing from this surface stress formulation. Thus, assumptions in RHG and DCCM need to be re-examined. Also, as theories invoked in RHG and DCCM are developed under assumption of deep water and high winds (Reichl et al., 2014;Ginis et al., 2015), adaptations for shallow water applications should be re-visited in the future. We also examined the effect of different drags on storm surge predictions. Compared to the bulk drag laws, both RHG and DCCM showed a small degree of sea state dependency, but not enough to produce drastically different surge results. The main take-home message from this section is that the spatial pattern of plays a big role on coastal storm surge predictions. In another word, information of as a function of wind speed only is not enough. cyclostrophic balance assumption should only be made when the Rossby number ( , which is a dimensionless number relating the ratio of nonlinear accelerations to the Coriolis force) at the RMW is large enough that the Coriolis term can be dropped. So the purpose was to remove the cyclostrophic balance assumption at the RMW, and re-derive the radial wind and pressure profiles using the full gradient wind equation. A modified expression of was obtained, referred to as , together with a new parameter introduced, the scaling factor . The generalized equations now can be used for a wide range of TCs without suffering from systematic errors associated with a small as the HM does. This is a huge improvement of the GAHM over the classic HM, especially for storms with 10 < 1. Another important feature of the GAHM is the introduction of the composite wind method, which allows the GAHM to use up to three storm isotachs in the forecast or best track to reconstruct wind and pressure fields during active storms. Performance of the GAHM was evaluated using seven selected hurricanes that struck the U.S. East Coast and the Gulf of Mexico in the past decades. Comparison between given isotachs and the modeled winds at distances to those isotachs suggested that the GAHM was able to consistently produce surface wind fields that match the NHC's advisory data. Comparison between the GAHM winds and the OWI and H*Wind indicated the GAHM is still in lack of many details of a hurricane, however, it is a good candidate for timely forecast use. As a prototype for parametric wind forecasting, the GAHM was designed to interpret storm information in NHC's forecast or best track advisories to construct a composite wind field for a wide range of TCs. In theory, wind observations made anywhere within the influential range of a hurricane could be synthesized into the final product by the parametric wind model. Future work is proposed to improve the GAHM so that it can assimilate wind data from other sources to yield better representation of the hurricane wind fields."}, {"section_title": "Storm Surge Study using Different Drag Laws", "text": "In this section, effects of different surface drag laws (Table 3.1) on storm surge predictions are investigated using Hurricane Irene 2011.

We can see that the surges from Garratt and GFDL14 have very similar spatial patterns, and the same happens between RHG and DCCM.

The surge patterns are greatly influenced by the spatial patterns of especially when storm approaching shore.  "}, {"section_title": "Discussion on Surface Wind Stress and Storm Surge Modeling", "text": "This section discusses the surface wind stress for storm surge modeling. As storm surge modelers, we are mostly concerned with coastal storm surge induced by landfalling hurricanes. Many approaches have been developed to estimate the surface wind stress \u20d1 over the past few decades, however, results are far from conclusive. In this study, we implemented a few sea state dependent stress formulations to the coupled ADCIRC+SWAN to examine their influences on storm surge predictions. Recognizing possible similarities and differences among different surface drag laws and identifying their limitations is the first step towards further application in coastal storm surge modeling. Garratt's wind speed-dependent, D03's wave age-dependent, and TY01's wave steepness-dependent formulas were derived from measurements at low to moderate wind speeds. To use these empirical formulas at hurricane wind speeds, values are simply extrapolated and sometimes can reach unreasonably large values. A cap value must be applied to avoid overestimation of at high wind speeds, which is not ideal. D03 and TY01 use statistically-derived formulas to relate the sea surface roughness 0 to statistical wave parameters, the wave age and wave steepness, respectively. However, their performances vary with sea states. Drennan et al. (2005) found that \uf0b7 Both methods yielded reasonable results of 0 for systems dominated by wind sea \uf0b7 D03 was preferred for undeveloped \"young\" wind sea \uf0b7 TY01 was favored for general mixed seas \uf0b7 Both two methods failed to provide adequate representation of 0 for systems dominated with swell Thus, D03 and TY01 cannot be universally applied for varies wind and wave regimes. The 2D wave spectrum-dependent surface stress formulas, RHG and DCCM, show the most promise for general application, although physics are not included to explicitly account for the impacts of breaking-wave, sea spray and air-flow separation on the surface roughness. Both RHG and DCCM compute the wave-induced form stress by integrating the momentum flux into waves over the entire frequency/wavenumber range. Since wave models such as SWAN and WWIII can only resolve wave spectrum up to 3 times the peak frequency, a spectral tail needs to be attached at the high frequency equilibrium range. Reichl et al. (2014) found that the surface stress is very sensitive to the value of the saturation tail level . However, very few direct measurements of exist under hurricane winds and its dependence on wind speed or wave age (or possibly other parameters) remains unclear. If the saturation level is taken to be a function of wind speed, wave age, or both, then the drag coefficient can be constructed to match any given observations or empirical parameterizations. In this study, two major experiments were conducted. The first experiment involved sensitivity test of the explicit sea state dependent drag to both prognostic wave spectrum and the diagnostic spectral tail. Two different saturation tails were examined, the well-tuned empirical one, and a more rudimentary extended one with a \u22124 slope and saturation tail level of that computed at 3 \u00d7 of the modeled spectrum. The most important finding of this study is that the drag coefficient is very sensitive to the spectral saturation level but is not as sensitive to the resolved part of the spectrum. For both tail options, it was found that the computed as well as the contribution of the tail to the total depend greatly on the saturation tail level specified. The extended tail option yields interesting results in deep water, but is rather problematic in shallow water. It is speculated that the \u22124 spectral tail commonly used for deep water condition might not be suitable for shallow water condition. Although the drag coefficient is not very sensitive to the prognostic wave field, it still introduces certain sea state dependency of compared to the bulk formula. Depending on the physics packages used in SWAN, the 2D wave spectrum simulated will be slightly different, and the stress computed in DCCM and RHG will slightly differ from each other. Thus, it is important to be aware of a) saturation tail option used and b) the wave physics packages used when computing the explicit sea state dependent drag using RHG and DCCM. The main take-home message from this experiment is that: 1) wave dependent stress is indeed very sensitive to the specification of the spectral tail; 2) the resolved wave spectrum introduces sea state dependency to , and is responsible for any misalignment between the total stress and the wind vector by taking into account the effect of opposing and crossing wind swells; 3) if as suspected that in coastal water is larger than in deep water, then the empirical tail that's derived under deep water conditions has to be tailored for shallow water application, but more observational and theoretical studies of surface drags in coastal water is needed. Although the explicit wave dependent stress formula is flawed at the moment, it still has merits that other bulk drag formula don't. Last but not least, we studied the effect of different drag laws on storm surge predictions using Hurricane Irene (2011) as a study case. The eight selected drag laws as discussed earlier were used to force the couple ADCIRC+SWAN model, and the maximum elevation were examined. Results suggested that different drag laws show distinctive spatial patterns although a few share similarities. Also the surge patterns are closely related to the spatial patterns of different drag laws. In the future, it is recommended to use real observational data to quantify the behavior of each drag law."}]
