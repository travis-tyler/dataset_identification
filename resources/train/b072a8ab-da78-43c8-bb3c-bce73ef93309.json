In 2011, college graduates ages 23-25 earned $12,000 more per year on average than high school graduates, and had employment rates 20 percentage points higher. Over the last 30 years, the increase in lifetime earnings brought by a college degree has increased by 75 percent, whereas costs have increased by 50 percent (Greenstone & Looney, 2010) . These economic benefits accrue to individuals, but also to society in the form of increased tax revenue, reduced crime, and faster economic growth.\nPreliminary and incomplete draft: Please do not cite or circulate\nThe rising costs and returns of going to college have led more students to borrow, and to take out larger loans, in order to pay for tuition, fees, and living expenses while in college. Over the last 20 years, inflation-adjusted published tuition and fees have more than doubled at fouryear public institutions, and have increased by more than 70 percent at private four-year and public two-year colleges (Figure 1 ). The fact that the total outstanding balance on student loans recently passed $1 trillion and media reports of students with large debts-often in excess of $100,000-have garnered a great deal of public attention. However, the debt picture for the typical college graduate is much less dire. For example, students who completed a four-year degree in 2011 accumulated approximately $25,000 in student loan debt ($23,800 at public institutions and $29,900 at private, non-profit institutions) (Baum & Payeam, 2012) . Debt per borrower is growing rapidly (at an annual rate of 1.2 percent above inflation at non-profit institutions and 2.1 percent at public institutions), but is still a manageable burden if the graduate is able to find gainful employment.\nIn the United States, student lending takes place through two channels, the federal lending programs and the private market for student loans. The federal lending program exists because, in the absence of government intervention, the private market would provide too few students access to loans, which would result in underinvestment in education at the national level. The basis for this theory is that unlike physical capital, human capital, or the skills that one obtains through education, cannot effectively serve as collateral for a loan. This makes student lending inherently risky, because a lender cannot foreclose on a student's education the same way it can foreclose on a home if the borrower goes into default. More generally, the loan program guarantees access to higher education to all students regardless of their ability to pay.\nPreliminary and incomplete draft: Please do not cite or circulate\nMost students first borrow from the federal government because the interest rates offered in federal lending programs are below what students are offered by private lenders. In these lending programs, interest rates are set by legislation and do not depend on the likelihood that a borrower will default. The amount that students can borrow from the government will depend on their family's income (or their own income if they are financially independent from their parents). Students from less well-off households will be eligible to borrow more at the subsidized rates offered by the government. Federal student loans carry additional benefits beyond the below-market interest rates. Borrowers who face financial hardship after leaving college are eligible for deferral or reduction of monthly payments and even forgiveness of their loan balance after a number of years.\nOnce students have exhausted their ability to borrow from the government, they can cover their remaining financial need with loans made by private financial institutions.

This is partly due to the limitations of existing data sources. The primary source of data on student aid is the Integrated Post secondary Education Data System (IPEDS). These data, which are derived from the Department of Education's survey of all institutions participating in federal student aid programs, report institution level lending variables including total outlays within the federal loan program and number of borrowers. While this information is incredibly important, it does not tell the whole story. For instance, we cannot tell how the use of private loans has changed over time or how much debt students accumulate over time.\nIn addition to the data available through IPEDS, the Department of Education publishes the findings from a few different longitudinal studies including the Baccalaureate and Beyond (B&B) and Beginning Postsecondary Students (BPS). These studies track a specific cohort of students for a set number of years. The B&B collects data for ten years following graduation from a bachelor's degree program and the BPS study collects data for 6 years following initial enrollment in postsecondary education. These longitudinal data source enable us to observe cumulative debt burdens for student borrowers, but only for a select cohort of students. The most valuable feature of these studies for this area of research is that they collect information on both earnings and education liabilities. However, the small number of cohorts available and the relatively short period of observation limit the usefulness of data derived from these studies.\nTwo additional, non-government data sources have been used to answer questions about the evolution of the student loan market. First, the College Board has compiled annual reports that summarize proprietary data on student borrowing from both federal and private sources.\nThese data are collected through a survey of institutions administered by the College Board. The annual, web-based survey collects data from nearly 4000 accredited undergraduate colleges and universities. While this data set succeeds in filling a void left by federal data, its usefulness is limited by the fact that the data are self-reported by institutions and thus are subject to inconsistencies in reporting and potential manipulation by institutions.\nAnother data source that has been used to produce evidence on the student loan market is the New York Federal Reserve Bank's Consumer Credit Panel. These data, which are based on the proprietary data used in credit bureau reports, capture longitudinal information on the debt portfolio of all individuals who have ever applied for credit. This resource has been used by researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to compile data on the market for outstanding student loan debt. The most apparent shortcoming of these data for the purpose of understanding the state of the student loan market is that they do not capture earnings information, which is needed to provide context for the debt analysis. The total outstanding debt is often cited in policy discussions, but this conveys limited information without an understanding of the earnings power that was generated by that investment.\nThe Federal Reserve Board administers a nationally representative survey that generates data with many of the features not available in the previously discussed data sources. The Survey of Consumer Finance (SCF) is administered every three years and collects information on household finances. Unlike the Consumer Credit Panel, the SCF generates cross-sectional data. The most important advantage of the SCF is that it captures information on both earnings and liabilities, including student loans. Unlike the other data sources, the SCF is a householdlevel survey. This is advantageous for our analysis. Since financial decision-making often takes places at the household level, individual analysis could easily misrepresent an individual's financial well-being. Although the SCF captures relatively few individual characteristics, it does report educational attainment, which is critical for this work. Additionally, it provides multiple measures of income, including one that is not sensitive to short-term fluctuations in earnings due to unemployment, underemployment or unusually high earnings. Since the SCF has been administered in a relatively consistent manner since 1989, it allows for thorough analysis of changes over time.\nWe use an extract of the SCF data files from 1989 to 2010 to track changes in student loan debt over time. We measure student loan debt as the total outstanding balance, measured in 2010 dollars, of all education debt held by households, calculated on a per-person basis (i.e. we divided household debt by two for households with two adults). We apply survey weights throughout the analysis so that the results are representative of the U.S. population of households."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Trends in Debt over Time", "text": "The SCF data show a dramatic increase in education debt among households with an average age of 20-40. Table 1 , with key indicators depicted in Figure 2 , shows that the share of all American households with education debt more than tripled from 14 percent in 1989 to 36 percent in 2010. Not only were more individuals taking out education loans, but they were taking out larger loans-perhaps the opposite one might expect as people cross the margin from non-borrowers to borrowers. Among households with positive debt, the mean per-person debt also more than tripled, from $5,810 to $17,916. Median debt grew somewhat less rapidly, from $3,517 to $8,500. Among all households, including those with no debt, mean debt increased eight-fold, from about $800 to about $6,500.\nThe change in the distribution of debt between 1989/1992 (combined to increase precision) and 2010 is depicted in Figure 3 , which shows the cumulative share of households with debt at or below at given level. In the earlier period, not only was the incidence of debt low, but most borrowers had very small loan balances. Only a trivial number of households had more than $20,000 in debt (per person) in 1989/1992, whereas in 2010, about 10 percent of households-or more than a quarter of borrowers-had balances exceeding $20,000. The incidence of very large debt balances is greater now than it was two decades ago, but is still quite rare. In 2010, about 8 percent of borrowers had balances in excess of $50,000.\nWe use the age range 20-40 in order to examine households that are likely to be within the repayment period of student loans while also capturing individuals who potentially take on graduate as well as undergraduate debt. Because we observe the remaining total balance of education debt rather than the initial amount borrowed, the trends over time we observe will reflect changes in both borrowing and repayment behavior. In order to examine repayment over time, we would ideally use a panel dataset that tracks a cohort of individuals over a long period of time. As a rough approximation using the SCF data, we track a group of age cohorts over time. Specifically, we examine the education loan balances of the group that was age 20-25 in 1989 or 1992 at three-year intervals through 2007 and 2010, when those cohorts were age 38-43 (we average over pairs of survey years in order to increase the precision of the results).\nThe results of this descriptive analysis are shown in Figure 4 . The share of this group that has any education debt declines over time from 28-29 percent at ages 20-28 to 16-18 percent at ages 35-43. Among the remaining borrowers, mean debt increases dramatically from under $7,000 to over $14,000. The combination of these two trends results in a relatively flat trend for mean debt (including those without any debt): it increases from about $2,000 to about $2,500 over the roughly 20-year period that we observe. We interpret these data as suggesting that many individuals with small education loan balances pay them off over this time period, but other individuals take on more loan debt (for graduate school or attending undergraduate programs at non-traditional ages) as they age, pushing up the balance of those with any debt."}, {"section_title": "Explaining Changes in Education Debt", "text": "The large increases in education debt levels over the last two decades documented in the SCF data and other data sources are often attributed to the increases in tuition charged by colleges and universities. The tuition trends shown in Figure 1 certainly support that theory. But there is also evidence that college students are relying more on debt to finance college costs and paying less out-of-pocket , suggesting that student behavior is changing in ways that favor loans over other ways of paying for college. And there remains the possibility that population changes, such as demographics and increases in educational attainment, are driving some of the changes in debt levels.\nWe begin by examining the extent to which changes in education debt levels can be explained by changing population characteristics. We focus on educational attainment given the fact that rising debt due to rising educational attainment may reflect smart human capital investments given the large and rising economic returns to education. Table 2a shows that educational attainment of households age 20-40 rose between 1989 and 2010. The share of households with no college experience fell from 41 to 31 percent, the share where at least one person had a bachelor's increased from 20 to 24 percent, and the share where at least one person had a graduate degree increased from 9 to 13 percent. Table 2b confirms that similar attainment trends are found after converting the household-level SCF data into individual-level data (assigning one-half the survey weight to each individual in a two-person household).\nIt is not surprising that education debt levels vary markedly by educational attainment, but debt trends over time vary noticeably as well, as shown in Figures 5 and 6. Among households with some college but no bachelor's degree, the incidence of debt increased from 11 to 41 percent. Households where at least one member holds a bachelor's degree saw an increase from 22 to 50 percent, and households with at least one graduate degree went from 33 to 58 percent. Among those with debt, the average per-person debt load increased 135 and 162 percent among households with some college and a bachelor's degree, respectively. Households with a graduate degree saw an increase of 311 percent, from just under $10,000 to more than $40,000. We implement this approach for all years of data and report the results in Figure 7 . As attainment increases over time, the gap between actual debt and the simulated debt with constant attainment grows. These calculations only take into account educational attainment, and do so in a simple way by taking the maximum for households. We next implement a multivariate decomposition that allows us to more accurately capture changes in attainment and also adjust for race/ethnicity. Table 2a shows that, between 1989 and 2010, the white share of the population fell and the Hispanic share rose. To the extent that race and debt are correlated, these changes could also have contributed to (or mitigated) rising debt levels.\nWe implement a multivariate decomposition approach along the lines of the one used by Bound, Lovenheim, and Turner (2012) This is not possible with the SCF data for two main reasons. First, the data do not contain information on how much respondents paid for their education, or even the institutions they attended-only the final degree obtained. Second, it is far from straightforward to estimate the causal effect of price on debt. As a rough substitute, we instead deflate the 2010 distribution of debt to a simulated 1989 level using data on published tuition and fees by year, assuming that the percentage increase in debt is the same as the percentage increase in published tuition. private four-year institutions, using enrollment shares as weights. 3 We use published tuition and fees even though net price (tuition and fees less grant and scholarships) would be a better measure because the latter is not available for a sufficiently long period of time. 4 As a result, we likely overstate the contribution of rising prices to growth in debt.\nThe results of this analysis are reported in Table 4 . The tuition adjustment explains 58 percent of the 1989-2010 increase in mean debt. Applying the reweighting procedure, which adjusts for changes in educational attainment and race, increases the share of the change explained to 72 percent. Our use of published rather than net price implies that this is an overestimate, but it still leaves 28 percent of the change unexplained. This remaining share of the change could be the result of some combination of changes in characteristics not measured in the SCF data and changes in borrowing behavior."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "The media has provided many anecdotes about recent graduates with large amounts of student loan debt who are in financial distress, often living in their parents' basements. Data on the distribution of loan debt, both from the SCF and other sources, indicate that extremely large 2 We calculate the years to use for tuition using the average age of the household rounded to the nearest year. debt burdens remain exceptional cases. Our analysis of the SCF data also provides some rough estimates of the role that different factors have played in driving up student debt over the last two decades. Rising educational attainment explains some of the trend, and debt data disaggregated by highest degree earned suggest that graduate education has played a particularly important role, especially for the cases of large debt balances.\nTuition is also a likely culprit, although the limitations of historical data on tuition make it difficult to tell exactly how much. Our analysis suggests that inflation in published prices may account for upwards of 60 percent of the increase in debt, leaving a significant share of the rise in debt that is unexplained. This fact coupled with evidence that students are substituting away from paying for college out-of-pocket towards financing suggests that behavioral shifts may account for some of the increase in education debt.\nThese analyses do not shed light on whether the increasing loan burdens taken on to finance education are leading to financial hardship for borrowers. To the extent that increases in attainment are the culprit, at least some of the increase in debt has financed sound investments.\nBut there are surely cases of investments in educations that didn't pay off, or didn't even result in a degree. In future work, we will expand this analysis to examine debt-to-income ratios and other measures of financial distress to determine whether the trends described above spell trouble for the student loan market at large.
