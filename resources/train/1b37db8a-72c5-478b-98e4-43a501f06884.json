[{"section_title": "", "text": "an astounding accomplishment! Americans indeed live in the \"land of plenty,\" yet each year, an estimated 195,825 lost time work injuries occur on U.S farms, and 5.2% of these injuries result in permanent injury (Myers, 2001) . Each year, more than 100 children who live or work on farms die from a farm related injury (Rivara, 1997) . Each year agriculture vies with mining, transportation, and construction for the top spot as the nation's deadliest industry (National Safety Council, 2002) . The focus on large scale industry and organized labor places the nearly 2 million farms in the shadow of more highly regulated industries.\nMore than one half of the nation's fanners also hold off fann jobs (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2002). Occupational health nurses touch the lives of fanners every day. They are workers on the line in the factory; they are sales representatives of large companies; they are secretaries in locally based businesses; they are teenagers in the band and on the football team; and they are government workers in offices. They are everywhere, and many times they are invisible because farming is not their primary occupation. Occupational health nurses do not ask employees if they farm, and workers rarely volunteer that information. The effects of two jobs can extract tremendous tolls on the bodies of the workers. The article in this issue"}, {"section_title": "ABOUT THE GUEST EDITOR", "text": "Dr. Reed In 1990, the U.S. Congress passed and funded a mandate to address the serious morbidity and mortality rates in agriculture. This mandate launched the first intensive examination of the health and safety of not only farmers and farm workers, but also of their families, who often are in harm's way by virtue of household membership. Despite the movement of agriculture toward corporate business ownership, more than 90% of the farms in the United States are still owned and operated by family units (Census of Agriculture, 2002) . That first decade of funding sparked research that generated a wealth of new information on the etiology of farm related illnesses and injuries. Early initiatives sprang up from the farm communities themselves. Farm Safety 4 Just Kids, started by a mother who lost her son because of a farm injury, reached out to local communities and became an\u0129 nternational movement. Community coalitions formed to mobilize safety efforts. Migrant health groups were established to advocate for the right to health care for this new labor force in agriculture.\nThe health environment is improving. Currently, there are fewer deaths caused by farm injuries, down to 104 per year for children compared to 360 a decade ago (Rivara, 1997) . Educational programs abound to teach farmers how to avoid occupational disability, yet health care providers remain essentially uninformed about the unique health risks in agriculture (Prince, 200 I).\nNurses of all specialties are positioned to deliver agricultural health messages and interventions that have the potential to influence the well being of the entire agricultural industry and all ages of the farm households. Nursing philosophy supports the principle that individuals should be considered in the context of their environment, as individuals and family members within communities (American Nurses Association, 1999)."}, {"section_title": "THE LABOR SHIFT IN AGRICULTURE", "text": "Farming is for the young and the old; it is truly a \"cradle to grave industry.\" Children begin farm work before they begin school. However, the mean age for principal farm operators is 55, compared to 39.3 for the general working population (Toossi, 2002 ; U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2002). The old system of \"swapping\" labor with farm neighbors no longer exists, and labor is difficult to find. Many farms currently employ migrant laborers at peak production times. These new workers may be totally unfamiliar with agriculture.\nAnother marked phenomenon in agriculture is the \"return to farming\" of adults who grew up on the family farm, moved away to work in cities, and return to the farm to begin their second careers as fulltime farmers. Agriculture changed while they were away. It is currently technologically dependent, with bioengineered crops, genetically altered animals and seeds, computer driven management programs, and global markets."}, {"section_title": "THE NEED FOR NURSES", "text": "A report to the nation in 1989 noted 8,000 nurses with training in agricultural health and safety were needed to meet the needs of families involved in production agriculture (Merchant, 1989) . Fifteen years later, a survey of schools of nursing in the southern region of the United States, where more than one fourth of all farms are located, revealed only 23% of the schools had any mention of agricultural health in their curricula (Reed, in press ).\nMore must be done to inform nurses of the health risks to the massive farm population. Educational programs as described by Jones in this issue can do much to catalyze diverse disciplines, including nurses, to include agricultural health and safety in their work. Nurse entrepreneurs, such as Mary Fleming whose work also is described in this issue, illustrate nurses can carve their own niches in the health education arena.\nThis issue of the journal is designed to increase awareness of the health and safety challenges to America's most independent industry. From the mainstay of the family farm to the new labor forces that support production, the issues are many and real. In their article, Culp and Umbarger outline critical life and labor issues of seasonal and migrant farm workers. As occupational health nurses, it is imperative not only to discover who Guest Editorial farms but also what health services need to be designed and delivered to safeguard the health of farmers and their families. The Continuing Education article in this issue can help occupational health nurses in serving the needs of the workers and their families who are exposed to the health risks of farming.\nThe next time you sit down to a meal, the next time you put on your 100% cotton shirt, the next time your child asks for crayons, and the next time you reach for that soy bar, remember these products are available because of the 6 million farm workers on America's 2 million farms. It is our responsibility to help keep farmers and their families healthy and safe.\nYour Career Page is easy to use and provides complete summary information-all in one place. "}]
