[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Alzheimer's disease pathology (AD) originates in the hippocampus and subsequently spreads to temporal, parietal, and prefrontal association cortices in a relatively stereotyped progression. Current evidence attributes this orderly progression to transneuronal transmission of misfolded proteins along the projection pathways of affected neurons. A network diffusion model was recently proposed to mathematically predict disease topography resulting from transneuronal transmission on the brain's connectivity network. Here, we use this model to predict future patterns of regional atrophy and metabolism from baseline regional patterns of 418 subjects. The model accurately predicts end-of-study regional atrophy and metabolism starting from baseline data, with significantly higher correlation strength than given by the baseline statistics directly. The model's rate parameter encapsulates overall atrophy progression rate; group analysis revealed this rate to depend on diagnosis as well as baseline cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker levels. This work helps validate the model as a prognostic tool for Alzheimer's disease assessment."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an amyloid-facilitated tauopathy (Braak et al., 2000) whose origin and subsequent advance within the brain is well characterized: the disease begins in the mesial temporal lobe, an event accompanied by the accumulation of misfolded b-amyloid and tau proteins, and thence progresses along fiber pathways. Histopathological evidence of this highly stereotyped progression has come to be known as the Braak model (Braak and Braak, 1996) : neurofibrillary tau tangles are first found in entorhinal cortex and hippocampus (stages I-II), then spread into the amygdala and basolateral temporal lobe (stages III-IV), followed by isocortical association areas (stages V-VI). Morphological changes accompanying this pathological progression are clearly visible on MRI, especially from crosssectional and longitudinal morphometric mapping (Fischl et al., 2002; Klauschen et al., 2009; Smith et al., 2004; Wu et al., 2007) . Longitudinal studies (Apostolova and Thompson, 2008; Apostolova et al., 2007; Thompson et al., 2003; Whitwell et al., 2007) confirm that progression follows vulnerable fiber pathways rather than spatial proximity (Englund et al., 1988; Kuczynski et al., 2010; Villain et al., 2008) , closely mirroring Braak pathological stages (Whitwell et al., 2007) .\nUntil recently, the causative mechanisms for this networked spread were thought to be passive, including secondary Wallerian degeneration, disconnection, loss of signaling, axonal reaction, and postsynaptic dendrite retraction (Seeley et al., 2009 ). The latest evidence, however, favors a transneuronal ''prionlike'' mechanism (Frost and Diamond, 2010; Jucker and Walker, 2013) , whereby implicated proteins misfold, trigger misfolding of adjacent same-species proteins, and thereupon cascade along neuronal pathways via transsynaptic or transneuronal spread (Clavaguera et al., 2009; Frost et al., 2009; Walker, 2011, 2013; Palop and Mucke, 2010) . Exogenous seeding of pathogenic proteins in the hippocampus caused remote pathology in connected regions (Clavaguera et al., 2009; Jucker and Walker, 2013) . Seeded templating of misfolded protein species can therefore be thought of as the causative ''propagating'' event, and other observed phenotypes-hypometabolism, atrophy, and cognitive dysfunction-result from the pathology.\nRecently, transneuronal transmission was mathematically modeled in our laboratory (Raj et al., 2012 ) by a diffusive mechanism mediated by and restricted to the brain's connectivity network, and the resulting topography of the disease was mathematically deduced. The network was obtained using diffusion MRI-derived healthy ''connectomes'' (Lo et al., 2010) . Intriguingly, the macroscopic consequences of diffusive prion-like propagation (the network diffusion or ND model) on healthy networks recapitulated patterns of atrophy in various dementias. Specifically, the model predicted spatially distinct ''eigenmodes,'' which mirrored disjoint brain regions known to be selectively targeted by different dementias (Buckner et al., 2005; Seeley et al., 2009 ). This mathematical reformulation of descriptive neuropathological observations into a deterministic encapsulation of neurodegenerative progression opens the possibility of dementia prognostication.\nThe goal of this study is to develop the theoretical model of Raj et al. (2012) into a clinically useful computational biomarker with the ability to predict future patterns of atrophy in susceptible individuals. Implicit in this work is that baseline atrophy is sufficient to give future predictions. Although motivated by stereotyped Braak-type progression, individual subjects' model predictions do not rely on a priori monolithic Braak staging assumptions. We are aware of no other existing tool that can predict future topography of AD atrophy and metabolism in individuals. There are clear applications of our biomarker in prognosis and as a monitoring tool in clinical trials.\nTo assess our biomarker's relative utility, we compare it against quantitative models representing the alternative hypothesis that growth of degeneration in different regions are independent processes that are not transmitted via white matter connections. We chose two established hypotheses: (1) a sigmoid model of disease progression (Jack et al., 2010) , which was verified using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid scans (Jack et al., 2013) , whereby every brain region undergoes a separate but temporally well-defined degeneration characterized by slow initial growth rate, peak intermediate growth, and a declining eventual growth rate reflecting saturation effects; and (2) an exponential model, where highly affected regions undergo faster degeneration separately and independently from other regions. The exponential model also describes activity-dependent degeneration, whereby lifetime neuronal activity, rather than network transmission, is thought to govern degeneration and rapidity (Buckner et al., 2005; Greicius et al., 2004) ."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": "The study cohort consists of all Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) subjects who had two to four longitudinal MRI and fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) scans; their demographics are summarized in Table 1 . Where appropriate, results are stratified by diagnosis: mild cognitive impaired (MCI) converters, MCI nonconverters, and AD. The outcome of the analysis pipeline on this data procedure was a regional atrophy/metabolism number for each subject, evaluated at 90 regions covering the entire cerebral gray matter, with no gaps, taken from a neuroanatomically accurate parcellated brain atlas.\nTesting the Regionally Varying Relationship between Baseline and Rate of Change Scatterplots of the empirical relationship between baseline atrophy/metabolism and their rate of change are shown in Figure S1 . Each dot represents a parcellated gray matter (GM) structure of each subject, where the x axis represents baseline value and the y axis the slope. There is no simple relationship between baseline atrophy/hypometabolism and its slope that fits all regions and subjects. Neither the straight line (exponential, green) nor parabola (sigmoid, cyan) captures this relationship fully, although both capture portions of the data. The ND model prediction (red, middle panel) appears to successfully cover the atrophy-slope plane. A topographic rendering of this relationship is shown in Figure S2 (top: regional baseline t-statistic of all patients' FDG-derived regional hypometabolism [left] , its rate of change [middle] , and the network diffusion model-predicted rate of change [right] ). The slope in hypometabolism is not simply proportional to baseline; there is general agreement in temporoparietal regions, but not in frontal and occipital regions. Black arrows point to specific structures that are discordant. Conversely, in mesial temporal structures, the rate of change is less than would be predicted by linearly extrapolating the baseline map. In these discordant structures, the network diffusion model appears to be a better predictor of slope than the baseline map.\nNext, we assess the accuracy of each model in predicting the regional rate of change from baseline in both MRI atrophy and FDG-PET-derived hypometabolism (Figure 1 ). The correlation between the measured and predicted slope of the entire MCI+AD cohort gave the following values: atrophy: R = 0.72 (exponential model), R = 0.68 (sigmoid), R = 0.85 (network diffusion); FDG hypometabolism: R = 0.48 (exponential), R = 0.40 (sigmoid), R = 0.75 (network diffusion). While all three models considered here capture to some extent the slope of atrophy/ hypometabolism, the ND model achieves the highest correlation. Fisher's R-to-z transform gave a significant difference in the reported R achieved by the proposed model and both competing models (p < 10"}, {"section_title": "\u00c02", "text": ")."}, {"section_title": "Predicting Future Patterns of Atrophy and Hypometabolism", "text": "Validation of the predictive ability of our model is contained in scatterplots in Figure 2 . Each point corresponds to a single region in a single subject. Both MRI-derived atrophy and FDG-PET-derived hypometabolism are shown. Measured regional baseline statistics already exhibit a strong and significant relationship to atrophy/metabolism at end of study (first and third columns), expectedly, since drastic progression within 2-4 years is unlikely. Correlation strength is generally higher for hypometabolism than for atrophy, probably due to lower noise and fewer artifact-inducing processing steps in FDG-PET images. Interestingly, a significant subset of regional atrophy data appear to stray from the diagonal (first column), implying that localized relationships are not sufficient to capture disease dynamics. A closer investigation of these discordant regions (see the Supplemental Experimental Procedures and Figure S2 , bottom) revealed them to occur mostly in the frontal and occipital cortex in MCI converters. These regions are typically involved in late, but not early, stages, distal but connected to vulnerable temporoparietal areas, hence ''next-in-line'' for future progression. The correlation strength R (Table 2) is significantly improved in all diagnoses by adding the ND model, and the above discordant ''off-diagonal'' regions were brought back onto the diagonal. Fisher's R-to-z transform indicates these improvements to be highly significant, implying that the model is adding strong predictive power that cannot be explained by the baseline data alone. The model greatly reduces unexplained variance (1 \u00c0 R 2 ), for instance in MCI converters, where it goes from 0.24 using baseline alone, to 0.08 using the ND model, constituting a net improvement of 300%. Note that these data are group-level summaries of individual subjects' predictions, using each individual's baseline scan. Hence, while these numbers amply characterize the capability of the prognostic biomarker, they do not indicate prediction performance for a given individual."}, {"section_title": "Robustness Analysis", "text": "To characterize the robustness of our putative biomarker against noise and intersubject variability, increasing amounts of independent Gaussian noise were added to the reference connectomes and the confidence interval (CI) of the R statistic in Table 2 was estimated using Monte Carlo simulations with 100 trials (Figure S6A) . Predicted R appears tolerant to moderate levels of connectome noise.

Figure 3 verifies that the group statistics of AD subjects, the best-characterized and stereotyped group, follows expected progression. The spheres are proportional to the t-statistic of MRI atrophy after logistic transform and color-coded by lobe (frontal = blue, parietal = purple, occipital = green, temporal = red, and subcortical = yellow). The ND model correctly recapitulates the classic Alzheimer progression from mesial temporal structures to parietal and finally frontal areas. The rate of progression parameter was estimated by empirical fitting to individual subject data as described earlier, but in order to minimize risk of overfitting, the time-since-onset parameter was fitted to each diagnostic group rather than to individuals. FDG hypometabolism results ( Figure 3B ) are similar. Next, we show six examples drawn from individual subjects from all three diagnosis categories, selected via visual inspection as typifying the most common modes of behavior we observed in each disease group. Figures 3C and 3D show two representative AD examples, whose classic temporal-dominant atrophy pattern remains steady over extrapolated time scales as it progressively grows more severe. Figure 4 shows two example MCI nonconverters. The left panel depicts regional MRI-derived atrophy at baseline with respect to ADNI healthy controls, after logistic transform to convert Z scores to positive atrophy values between 0 and 1. The next two panels show the network diffusion model prediction from baseline atrophy, extrapolated to 5 years and 10 years out. The top case exhibits classic MCI topography with hippocampal involvement, but model extrapolation does not indicate subsequent extrahippocampal spread or temporal involvement, consistent with MCI-nonconverter status. The bottom case is an interesting variant of the nonconverter case, with prominent widespread atrophy at baseline in the frontal cortex. However, extrapolated atrophy patterns stay within the frontal areas and subsequently spread to parietal, but not temporal, regions-in consonance with MCI-nonconverter diagnosis. Figure 5 shows two examples of MCI converters, one of which (bottom row) exhibits the classic AD pattern of progression within and outward from the temporal lobe. Baseline atrophy is overall mild, but the extrapolated patterns show the classic progression from MCI to AD. Specifically, the recruitment of temporal and subcortical regions, which are associated with memory-related cognitive dysfunction, increases prominently. The top case also exhibits prominent and early temporal involvement, but longitudinal predictions are more prominent in frontal and parietal regions. This case is consistent with current diagnosis of MCI converter, but worsening frontoparietal atrophy may be expected."}, {"section_title": "Results of Subject-Wise Fitting of Model Parameters", "text": "The fitted model parameters-time between onset and baseline scan t post\u00c0onset and the rate constant of network diffusion b-are quite variable across subjects. The distribution of b, shown in Figure S3 , categorized by diagnosis, appears to follow an exponential distribution, whose parameters we fit using MATLAB's expfit() function and display in Table 3 .

Notably, a clear order emerges, such that\nwith the mean rate parameter of AD group almost twice as large as the MCI groups, whether it is fitted to MRI atrophy or FDG hypometabolism data, an intuitive and expected result.

Scatterplots depicting these potential influences are shown in Figure S4 , along with Pearson correlation statistics. These results suggest little independent role for CSF biomarkers, after accounting for the information contained in the baseline image, in determining the rate of progression or time since onset.

We repeated this analysis for genotypic dichotomization into APOE-\u03b54 allele noncarriers and carriers ( Figure S5 , right). There was no difference between the two groups when fitting b to MRI atrophy, but a significant difference was observed when fitting to FDG-PET, where exponential parameter l was 0.29 for the former group and 0.45 for the latter group."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Summary of Results", "text": "The proposed predictive model captures diffusive interneuronal propagation enacted on the brain's connectivity network, an approach that was previously shown to recapitulate classic topographic patterns of common dementias (Raj et al., 2012) . Although the concepts on which this model is based are known, our main contribution is that we were able to formalize and mathematically encode existing understanding and employ them toward the goal of predicting future progression in individual subjects. By turning different competing descriptive hypotheses into testable predictions, we were able to statistically compare them. We found strong statistical evidence in favor of the network diffusion model.\nThe major findings of this study were as follows. First, using baseline MRI volumetrics and PET-based glucose hypometabolism, the model predicted future atrophy/metabolism patterns of AD and MCI subjects drawn from the ADNI database. Second, the model captured the regionally varying baseline and slope relationship accurately and to a larger extent than alternate localized growth models, viz sigmoid, and exponential growth. Third, an investigation of the fitted rate of progression in individuals showed group differences between MCI and AD. The role of CSF biomarkers in determining the rate of progression is revealed only after dichotomizing the CSF data. Evidence for the role of APOE allele status is mixed. Since the proposed predictive model works on individual subjects, it is a computational prognostic biomarker. Group-level summary statistics are presented here to characterize this biomarker, but the underlying data come from individual subjects' predictions. A thorough robustness analysis via Monte Carlo simulations and bootstrap analysis demonstrated the predictor performance to be insensitive to connectome noise and intersubject variability. Each result is discussed below in the context of current literature."}, {"section_title": "Capturing the Relationship between Regional Atrophy and Its Rate of Change", "text": "The regional baseline/slope relationship provides an effective way of testing the validity of progression models, since in the 2-to 4-year window of observation, the progression in the ADNI cohort may be considered roughly linear. It is known from morphometric AD studies that the baseline/rate relationship is complex ; atrophied regions appeared to evolve differently depending on disease stage (Whitwell et al., 2007) , and atrophy rate was reported to have a regionally varying relationship with Ab deposition (Tosun et al., 2011) . Our result (Figures S1 and S2) also suggests a regionally varying baseline/slope relationship. Baseline and change values are in good agreement in classically vulnerable temporoparietal regions, but not in frontal and occipital regions, which give the ''off-diagonal'' effect seen in Figure 2 . However, these regions are strongly connected to alreadyaffected regions, hence ''next-in-line'' for future changes according to the transneuronal transmission hypothesis. Thus, without considering network connectivity, these regions would arguably be prone to underestimation as sites of future change. Examining the correlation strength between measured atrophy slope and model prediction (Figure 1 ), the network model is strongly predictive of slope (R = 0.85 for atrophy slope, R = 0.75 for hypometabolism slope). A nonnetworked model of localized spread, whether exponential (predicting a linear relationship) or sigmoid (parabolic relationship), also predicts the slope, but not as well."}, {"section_title": "Comments on Alternative Localized Growth Models", "text": "The localized growth models were obtained by mathematically encoding existing hypotheses. We allowed different regions and subjects to be placed at different points along the sigmoid/exponential curves, since they may be at different stages of degeneration. In Jack et al. (2013) , a similar strategy of placing different subjects (although not regions) at different points along the sigmoid curve demonstrated that long nonlinear sigmoid or exponential dynamics over the duration of the disease can be fit to narrow time windows exhibiting only linear trends. The choice of these simple local growth models in favor of nonlocal statistical models, e.g., projections to ''AD-signature'' regions (Da et al., 2014) , was motivated by our goal of assessing the specific role of the network in determining the dynamics of AD."}, {"section_title": "Agreement with Prior Longitudinal Imaging Studies", "text": "MRI atrophy is strongly correlated with cognitive impairment and its topographic distribution correlates well with Braak staging at autopsy (Jack et al., 2010; Whitwell et al., 2009) . FDG-PET is correlated with impaired synaptic function (Rocher et al., 2003) , cognitive impairment, and postmortem AD diagnosis (Hoffman et al., 2000) . Apostolova et al. elegantly described the patterns of AD progression from longitudinal MRI, showing stereotyped spread of atrophy from temporal to parietal and frontal regions (Apostolova and Thompson, 2008; Apostolova et al., 2007) . Morphological changes in MCI patients measured using voxel-based morphometry followed a classic Braak pattern of progression, starting from anterior medial temporal regions at 3 years prior to conversion, spreading to nearby temporal and parietal cortices, and at AD diagnosis encompassing the classic temporoparietofrontal AD pattern (Whitwell et al., 2007) . The ND model's predictions (Equation 5) are in good agreement with these longitudinal observations. The MCI-converter examples ( Figure 4 ) recapitulate almost perfectly the progression described in Whitwell et al. (2007) . Similarly, the AD cases (Figure 3 ) are in good agreement with the topographic evolution shown in Apostolova and Thompson (2008) and Whitwell et al. (2007) . Of note, the ND model gives more accurate prediction than linear local growth reflected by baseline correlations.\nThe Role of Focal Origin, Syndromic, Pathological, and Genotypic Characteristics We do not explicitly rely on any kind of selective vulnerability or origination site, e.g., entorhinal cortex and hippocampus (Braak and Braak, 1992; Braak and Del Tredici, 2012; Braak et al., 2000) , this being implicit in the baseline scan. Origination site might be dictated by selective vulnerability due to various stressors (Braak et al., 2000; Palop et al., 2006; Saxena and Caroni, 2011; Seeley et al., 2009) or innate gene expression in origination sites (Goel et al., 2014) . Presented data suggest that even if origination sites are anatomically or architectonically determined, the subsequent spread and eventual topographic fate of AD pathology are likely determined by network topology.\nThe puzzling dissociation between imaging-based neurodegenerative patterns and the distribution of AD-causing pathology (tau and Ab) is well known (Jack et al., 2010) . MRI atrophy and FDG-PET binding are closely associated with cognitive deficits and tangles, but not with Ab deposition (Jack et al., 2010; Landau et al., 2012; Murray et al., 2011; Robinson et al., 2011) . Three distinct topographical patterns were reported in AD-classical (75%), limbic predominant (14%), and hippocampus sparing (11%)-reflecting heterogeneous origination and spread sites (Murray et al., 2011) . Approximately 20%-40% of cognitively normal elderly people have significant Ab plaque deposition (Jack et al., 2010) . Given these dissociations, the utility of a single-spread model in describing AD topography might be doubted. However, the model's function is not to capture a specific pathologic agent like amyloid or tau but to model progression starting at baseline markers of degeneration, howsoever they may have arisen.\nInterestingly, we found a strong dependence of the subjectwise fitted rate of progression parameter b on subjects' diagnostic status but no correlation between baseline CSF biomarkers and rate of progression. A strong group difference was however seen when the subjects are dichotomized into high-or low-biomarker regimes (Table 3) . Numerous prior reports show a definite association between CSF biomarker levels and risk of AD. It could be that our fitting procedure or CSF biomarker levels or both are noisy. Since the subject's morphometric information is already built into the estimate of b via Equation 6, our result might simply imply that CSF biomarkers lack incremental power to predict rate of progression, beyond what is explained by imaging. This is in line with converging understanding based on the early deposition and subsequent plateauing of amyloid (Villemagne et al., 2013) , that while CSF biomarkers are good predictors of conversion risk, neurodegenerative markers like MRI are more sensitive predictors of current disease state and its rate of decline (Da et al., 2014; Dickerson and Wolk, 2013; Fjell and Walhovd, 2011; Jack et al., 2009; Vemuri et al., 2009 ). Our dichotomized CSF results support this interpretation, such that CSF biomarker levels appear to exert an effect on rate of progression only beyond the pathologic threshold (Fjell et al., 2010; Mattsson et al., 2014; Schott et al., 2010) . The effect of APOE status on rate of decline b was mixed: nonsignificant for MRI atrophy but significant for FDG-PET; potentially, this could be due to the generally higher signal to noise ratio observed in FDG data."}, {"section_title": "Clinical and Diagnostic Implications", "text": "These results provide support to the network diffusion model as a prognostic aid to the clinician, allowing them to predict what The spheres are proportional to effect size and color-coded by lobe: frontal = blue, parietal = purple, occipital = green, temporal = red, subcortical = yellow.

Knowledge of what the future holds can empower patients and allow informed choices regarding lifestyle, therapeutic, and nontherapeutic interventions. The ND model could potentially be used to enhance cohort stratification and monitoring accuracy in large-scale clinical trials and thus improve statistical power at a lower cost. By allowing extrapolation of baseline state regardless of syndromic classification, these data could present an opportunity to disentangle and disambiguate AD subtypes in a clinical setting. Future neuroradiologists might plausibly eschew uncertain syndromic categorization in favor of quantitative models of topographical patterning of future disease states as early markers of disease. Cases of mixed dementia could also benefit, where classical region-based atrophy descriptors might prove unsatisfactory."}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "This is a first-order, linear, parsimonious model of diffusive spread that assumes static networks, even though both atrophy and the network must dynamically evolve. However, these nonlinear effects are difficult to capture analytically and can only be accessed via numerical finite difference computations-a topic of future work. The model only considers the long-range transmission of proteopathic carriers and not their local ''leaking'' via synapses and dendrites, because local circuitry is neither observable by noninvasive tractography nor necessary for modeling large-scale macroscopic patterns. Technical limitations of the volumetric and tractography processing pipelines include HARDI spatial and angular resolution, coregistration errors, low test-retest reliability of volumetric data, and the distance bias inherent in tractography. These issues are even more problematic in longitudinal analysis, but we believe this high-powered study is able to withstand these challenges. Although the model enables long-term projections, its validation was limited to public (ADNI) data sets of rather narrow time span (2-4 years), precluding long-term longitudinal follow-up. One of the most attractive aspects of our model, its ability to capture nonlinear trajectories of disease, is poorly tested by these data. We hope that future work will address this gap. Finally, healthy reference rather than individual patients' connectomes were used for individual prediction to avoid individual variability and noise and because the ADNI database did not contain diffusion MRI scans. However, variability in connectomes appears to exert only minor influence on our model (see Figures S5 and S6 of Raj et al., 2012) ; hence, our conclusions should remain valid and withstand the scrutiny of future investigations."}, {"section_title": "EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data Description", "text": "Healthy Cohort Axial T1-weighted fast spoiled gradient-echo scans (TE = 1.5 ms, TR = 6.3 ms, TI = 400 ms, 15 flip angle, 230 3 230 3 156 isotropic 1 mm voxels) and high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) data (55 directions, b = 1,000 s/mm 2 , 72 1.8-mm-thick interleaved slices, 0.8594 3 0.8594 mm planar resolution) were acquired on a 3T GE Signa EXCITE scanner from 73 fully consented young healthy volunteers under a previous institutional review boardapproved study (Kuceyeski et al., 2013) .

Since all brain regions are not the same size, each row and column of the Laplacian is normalized by their sums. This diffusion model captures transneuronal propagation as a connectivity rather than distance-based process, enacted via active axonal transport followed by membrane or exocytotic processes into extracellular space. Fiber length does not enter this model, since there is no evidence that axonal transport efficiency is dependent on fiber length. From matrix algebra, Equation 1 is satisfied by\nwhere x 0 is the initial pattern of the disease process, on which the term e \u00c0bHt acts essentially as a spatial and temporal blurring operator. We therefore call e \u00c0bHt the diffusion kernel, and Equation 2 is interpreted as the impulse response function of the network. Since the above requires matrix exponentiation, it is solved via the eigendecomposition of the network Laplacian H into a number of eigenmodes into which the diffusive process becomes trapped, and disease evolution will be governed by these eigenmodes:\nThe eigenvalues l i of the Laplacian H are in the interval [0,2], with a single 0 eigenvalue and a small number of near-zero eigenvalues. Most eigenmodes u i correspond to large eigenvalues that quickly decay due to exponentiation, leaving only the small eigenmodes that remain operative."}, {"section_title": "Relationship to Atrophy/Metabolism", "text": "The measurable phenotype (regional atrophy in MRI, hypometabolism in FDG-PET) in region k is assumed to be the consequence of the accumulation of pathology; hence, it is modeled as the integral\nOn the whole brain, this gives F\u00f0t\u00de = R t 0 x\u00f0t\u00de dt.

However, it is known that different brain regions and different subjects experience atrophy, hypometabolism, and pathology at different time points; hence, we allow different subjects and brain regions to be placed at different points along the above curves, such that for region j of subject k, we hypothesize\nwhere t j,k is the time since disease onset of region j in subject k. Thus, all subjects and regions are hypothesized to fall on the same growth curve with a single scale parameter a, albeit different temporal location t j,k . Note that neither nonnetworked model formula involves connectivity, since they assume localized progression. The corresponding relationship predicted by the exponential model is, by definition, dF j,k /dt f F j,k (t). It can be shown that the sigmoid model would predict that dF j,k (t)/dt f F j,k (t)(max(F j,k ) \u00c0 F j,k (t))-an analytic result that appears to have been reproduced statistically in an earlier thorough investigation of longitudinal behavior of amyloid PET data (Jack et al., 2013) . In that paper, a B-spline fitting procedure revealed that an ''inverted U''-shaped curve best described the relationship between amyloid burden at baseline and its rate of change. The quadratic expression above would predict exactly this curve shape. Estimating Unknown Model Parameters For prediction of individual subjects, two unknown parameters must be estimated for each subject: the time between onset and baseline scan t post\u00c0onset and the rate constant of network diffusion b. We do this by fitting these parameters to measured regional slope data, using the baseline-slope relationship given by Equation 6. Denoting y\u00f0bt\u00debH\u00f0bt\u00dec baseline , we estimate where corr (,,,) refers to the Pearson correlation coefficient between two vectors, c is the measured atrophy or hypometabolism of the given subject, and Dc/Dt is the measured slope. Then, the rate constant b is given by the best estimate of the scaling required for the fit:\nFinally,\nCSF Biomarker Analysis CSF biomarker levels of amyloid, tau, and p-tau were obtained from the ADNI database, and subsequently, their prediction ability of ND model parameters was investigated using Pearson correlation. We investigated which brain regions displayed the most discordant atrophy in our MRI--derived volumetric series from ADNI cohort. These are the regions that fall within the \"off--diagonal\" areas in Figure 2 , as described in the main body of the paper. In order to determine these regions, we back--projected the points shown in the scatter plots of Figure 2 , and calculated how often each brain region fell within this off--diagonal zone. For the purpose of this exercise, the off--diagonal zone was defined as any point whose end atrophy was more than 3 times its baseline atrophy. The resulting data was converted to a histogram, as a ratio, such that a region mapped to 0 on this histogram would never end up in the discordant zone, whereas a region mapped to 1 would always end up in the discordant zone. These histogram ratios were then plotted on the whole brain using our standard glass--brain rendering, such that each region is depicted by a sphere. The size of the sphere is proportional to this discordant histogram ratio, and its color represents the lobe to which the region belongs. This data is shown in Supplemental Figure 2 , top. Only the MCI--converter group is being shown here."}, {"section_title": "Characterization of robustness via Monte Carlo simulation of additive noise in reference connectome", "text": "The issue of robustness of the model against noise in the connectome is critical, since the model is based on the connectome. We investigate this here, as follows. Starting from the observed connectome data, we added increasing amounts of noise to each connection, drawn from an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random noise of increasing variance. Then, for each variance level, Monte Carlo simulations with 100 trials were run and the R statistic of the Pearson correlation between the subjects' atrophy and the (noise--corrupted) model computed. The mean R statistic over 100 trials was reported at each noise variance level. The results of this analysis are contained in Supplemental Figure 6A . The predictions appear reasonably tolerant to moderate levels of connectome noise."}, {"section_title": "Characterization of robustness via Bootstrap analysis of variability among subjects", "text": "The issue of robustness against natural variability between subjects is also critical. While we showed above that the choice of connectome and its noise do not unduly affect the performance of our predictors, the issue of variability in patient data remains. How sensitive are the presented results to the choice of particular subjects used in our study? How internally consistent are the atrophy maps of each disease group? The most principled way we know of exploring the effect of variability in available samples is Bootstrap resampling test, a well--known statistical resampling method (Severiano et al. 2011 ), which we are proposing in response to these concerns. Bootstrap sampling involves drawing a large number of samples from the existing set of samples, but doing this independently for each sample, and allowing replacements -i.e. a single sample from the set may occur multiple times in any of the bootstrap samples. By repeatedly resampling from the available data a subset of subjects, and gathering the outcome variable in each case, this technique builds a distribution of the likely variability in the outcome variable due to sampling errors that reflect the inter--subject variability. From well--known principles, this histogram is then thought to reflect the natural variability expected from this sample.\nprimary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early Alzheimer's disease (AD). Determination of sensitive and specific markers of very early AD progression is intended to aid researchers and clinicians to develop new treatments and monitor their effectiveness, as well as lessen the time and cost of clinical trials.\nThe Principal Investigator of this initiative is Michael W. Weiner, MD, VA Medical Center and University of California -San Francisco. ADNI is the result of efforts of many co--investigators from a broad range of academic institutions and private corporations, and subjects have been recruited from over 50 sites across the U.S. and Canada. The initial goal of ADNI was to recruit 800 subjects but ADNI has been followed by ADNI--GO and ADNI--2. To date these three protocols have recruited over 1500 adults, ages 55 to 90, to participate in the research, consisting of cognitively normal older individuals, people with early or late MCI, and people with early AD. The follow up duration of each group is specified in the protocols for ADNI--1, ADNI--2 and ADNI--GO. Subjects originally recruited for ADNI--1 and ADNI--GO had the option to be followed in ADNI--2.
