Many of those studies, however, were hampered by a crosssectional design.\nWe studied the association between APOE \u03b54 status and WMH in a longitudinal framework, for a population with limited cardiovascular risk factors but heterogeneous in terms of AD diagnoses. We used a novel approach for automatic longitudinal WMH lesion segmentation, with the aim of providing greater precision to the assessment of WMH changes and thereby clarifying the relevance of APOE \u03b54 in the accumulation of WMH.\n\n\n\nThe association between amyloid pathology, APOE and WMH probably reflects the link between A\u03b2, APOE \u03b54 and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) (Haglund & Englund, 2002; Verghese et al., 2011) . Since a similar tendency was observed after adjustment for diagnostic group or A\u03b2 level, the additional effects of APOE on the vasculature, independently of amyloid, are likely to account for the much faster increase in WMH for subjects homozygous \u03b54 subjects; though amyloid has an independent effect in itself, as indicated by the significant interaction term.\nThough the synergetic circle linking WMH, A\u03b2 and amyloid deposition is widely documented (Donahue & Johanson, 2008; Gupta, Iadecola, & York, 2015; Verghese et al., 2011; Zlokovic, 2011) , other explanations for the relationships between APOE status and WMH have been suggested. The APOE \u03b54 allele has been linked with the permeability of the blood brain barrier (BBB) and with a decrease in the tight junctions of the blood vessels' endothelium (Nishitsuji, Hosono, Nakamura, Bu, & Michikawa, 2011 ). An increased permeability could in turn lead to neuroinflammatory processes, which may contribute to the development of WMH.\nThe dose-dependent association with the number of \u03b54 alleles could be linked to the hypothesis of the potential protective effect of allele \u03b53 on the BBB with respect to neuroinflammation (Bell et al., 2012) . Furthermore, APOE \u03b54 has been associated with a decrease in glucose uptake, thus leading to deprived regions more vulnerable to ischemia (Alata, Ye, St-Amour, Vandal, & Calon, 2014) . APOE \u03b54 homozygotes have also been associated with a reduction in capillary surface (Salloway et al., 2002) in AD; this reduction would directly affect the blood supply in white matter thereby promoting the development of WMH lesions.

APOE \u03b54 is associated with increased cerebral amyloid plaque deposition and amount of white matter hyperintensities (WMH).\nWMH are associated with increasing age in apparently healthy elderly subjects and inversely related to executive function and processing speed (Mortamais, Artero, & Ritchie, 2013) . They are thought to be a marker of cerebral small vessel disease, and possible pathophysiological explanations for the imaging change include partial ischemia of the tissue and degradation of the blood brain barrier (Wardlaw, Vald\u00e9s Hern\u00e1ndez, & Mu\u00f1oz-Maniega, 2015) . In line with a possible vascular etiology, WMH are associated with cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension (Abraham et al., 2015) , diabetes (Brundel, Kappelle, & Biessels, 2014) and smoking (Power et al., 2015) . However, WMH also occur with greater frequency in AD patients (Holland et al., 2008; Provenzano et al., 2013) compared with normal controls. Interestingly, from the point of view of AD, parenchymal WMH can also be related to cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), where amyloid protein affects blood vessel function, potentially impairing the supply of oxygen and nutrients to the brain (Esiri et al., 2015; Greenberg, 2002; Holland et al., 2008; Zipfel, Han, Ford, & Lee, 2009) . Studies that have investigated the link between WMH and APOE status have led to contradictory results (Benedictus et al., 2013; Brickman et al., 2014; Esiri et al., "}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data selection", "text": "Data used were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu). The ADNI project was launched in 2003 as a public-private partnership, whose primary goal has been to test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early AD.\nInformation about the study can be found at www.adni-info.org. Data collection was approved by each centre's Institutional Review Board and participants gave written informed consent at time of enrolment.\nAt their initial visit, following clinical and neuropsychological assessment, each subject was given one of four diagnoses: normal control (NC), early mild cognitive M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P T E D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT impairment (EMCI), late mild cognitive impairment (LMCI) or probable AD. To be included in the ADNI study, newly recruited participants had to score 4 or below on the modified Hachinski scale for cerebrovascular disease, thereby limiting the range of WMH at baseline. Furthermore, included MCI subjects had to present with an amnestic form of cognitive decline as opposed to a vascular form associated with executive dysfunction.\nWe selected subjects from the ADNI database using criteria based on available quality scans. Only subjects for whom at least four imaging time points with adequate FLAIR images were selected. In order to avoid introducing any preprocessing bias into the analysis, only subjects with T1 scans preprocessed with N3 histogram sharpening, and corrected for B1 bias field and gradient non linearity were used. Subjects were further excluded if they had poor quality imaging. Figure 1 presents the flowchart of data selection. According to the ADNI record of adverse events, none of the selected subjects suffered from stroke during the course of the study.\nThe genotyping for APOE was performed at screening visit using DNA extracted by Cogenic using a 3mL aliquot of EDTA blood while the level of CSF A\u03b2 is obtained using the xMAP Luminex platform and the Innogenetics/Fujirebio AlzBio3 immunoassay kits.

Instead of considering each time point independently and thereby increasing the variability in the longitudinal assessment, an average image was iteratively created. Alignment was achieved through matching intensities of normal tissue in the images in an iterative procedure involving steps of affine and non-rigid registration using jointly the two pulse sequences, the FLAIR sequence being affinely aligned to the T1 weighted image (Modat et al., 2010 (Modat et al., , 2014 . Based on the results of an existing method (Sudre et al., 2015) applied to the average image, the WMH segmentation at each time point was generated. In brief, this method builds a Bayesian probabilistic data model based on an evolving Gaussian mixture model (GMM) which is able to account for observation outliers and incorporates anatomical priors and contextual information for the average appearance model. The model was then further used to constrain the segmentation at each time point. To do so, the model structure (number of Gaussian components) and its associated parameters and resultant segmentation were used to initialize the optimization of the data modelling in the original space of each time point and provide a priori information. Probabilistic lesion maps were obtained from the GMM based on the evaluation of outlierness when compared to the healthy WM and integrated to determine the final WMH volumes. The total intracranial volume (TIV), that included total brain volume, ventricles and CSF between the brain and meninges, was automatically obtained using a previously M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P T E D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT described method . A single measure of TIV for each individual, generated from the average image, was used as a covariate in statistical analyses."}, {"section_title": "Statistical analysis", "text": "In order to assess how our method compared to the first measurements obtained through the method detailed by De Carli et al. (De Carli, Maillard, & Fletcher, 2013) (UC Davis' method), made available on the ADNI database, we calculated Pearson's and Spearman's correlation coefficients. In addition, we assessed agreement between methods through construction of the geometric mean of the ratio of the volumes together with 95% reference ranges. Since differences in volumes may be related to lesion size we reported these ratios and corresponding reference ranges separately in low vs. high lesion volumes (bisected at the median of the mean of the two volumes).\nAll the statistical analyses were performed using Stata 12 v1. Due to the skewness of the WMH volumes they were log-transformed prior to analysis. Cross-sectional analysis of the baseline log-transformed WMH volumes was performed using linear regression models including age, TIV and sex as covariates in all models. Four models were fitted: these included diagnosis status (Model ASTD), genetic status (Model ASTG), genetic and diagnosis status (Model ASTGD), and genetic status and CSF A\u03b242 concentration (Model ASTGA\u03b2) as predictor variables. F-tests were used to assess differences between groups after adjustment for covariates. Fitted group specific means, standardized to a 50/50 mixture of males and females at age 72.2 years with a TIV of 1552 mL (with 95% confidence intervals), were also computed M A N U S C R I P T"}, {"section_title": "A C C E P T E D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT", "text": "and back-transformed. These age and TIV values were chosen as they were the mean values across all subjects.\nLongitudinal changes in WMH volume were assessed using linear mixed models, with random intercepts and slopes, for the repeated measures. Linear mixed models, provided that they are properly specified, appropriately allow for the nonindependence of repeated measures from the same subject (Verbeke & Molenberghs, 2000) . The dependent variable in all models was the log-transformed volume of WMH with time from initial measurement treated as both a fixed and random effect (thereby allowing slopes to differ between subjects). Other fixed effects were group terms (diagnosis and/or APOE status) and group-time interaction terms (thereby allowing mean rates of change to differ between groups) and age, TIV, and sex and their interactions with time. One model (Model ASTG) investigated differences in slope between the APOE groups, a second (Model ASTD) differences between the diagnostic groups and a third (Model ASTGD) differences according to both of these factors simultaneously. A fourth model (Model ASTGA\u03b2) investigated APOE status and CSF A\u03b242 concentration as predictors of rates of WMH volume progression.\nWald tests were used to compare rates of change between groups after adjustment for covariates. Fitted group specific mean rates of change (and 95% confidence intervals), standardized to a 50/50 mixture of males and females aged 72.2 with a TIV of 1552mL, were computed and back-transformed from each model. \nselection bias might be added since subjects accumulating higher loads of WMH and AD pathology may drop out more quickly than those with few WMH; in ADs four time points may be more difficult to achieve. Despite these potential limitations, a tendency for increased WMH volume and rates of change with diagnostic severity was still observed.\nEnsuring the appropriate modelling of biological processes is not trivial. A variety of different ways of modelling change in WMH are used in the literature making comparisons difficult across studies. Most studies calculate absolute changes on an untransformed scale. However, since there is evidence that WMH changes are positively related to baseline WMH volume load in both normal and dementia populations (Sachdev, Wen, Chen, & Brodaty, 2007; Schmidt, Enzinger, Ropele, Schmidt, & Fazekas, 2003) we chose to analyze changes on a log scale since they implicitly allow the magnitude of absolute change to be related to baseline level.\nOur finding that different patterns of WMH evolution were related to APOE status is consistent with previously reported results (Godin et al., 2009) in normal aging, with a much higher rate of increase in subjects homozygous for APOE \u03b54 compared with heterozygous subjects or non-carriers. The observation of no statistically significant difference in rate of change between heterozygous 43 and homozygous 33 may be taken as a possible explanation for disagreements regarding the link of APOE \u03b54 and WMH evolution since in some studies the population was simply dichotomized into carriers and non-carriers (Lo & Jagust, 2012) . The different strengths observed with the covariates for the 43 and 33 carriers may reflect potential differences in the pathological process between these two groups.\nmicrobleeds (Yates et al., 2014) could be related to the exacerbated deleterious effects of vascular risk factors on WM in APOE \u03b54 carriers (De Leeuw et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2015) . The possible joint effects and interaction of vascular risk factors such as hypertension and APOE \u03b54 on the blood vessels is therefore in need of further investigation with respect to the development of WMH.\nSo far, cross-sectional studies have reported contradictory findings regarding the relationship between APOE \u03b54 and WMH. This is further illustrated here by the absence of evidence of a difference across genetic status at baseline while significantly different rates of change were observed. This finding strongly supports the need to better understand the time course and developmental pattern of pathological processes. Cross-sectional studies need to consider age imbalances between groups since it is well understood that increasing age has a strong association with WMH accrual (van Dijk et al., 2008) . In our study, we chose to adjust for age as is done in most WMH accrual studies (Godin et al., 2009 ). This age adjustment explains why the AD group have larger WMH volumes than the somewhat younger late MCI group before (table 1), but not after age adjustment (table 2) . Limitations of cross-sectional studies may be partially overcome by the application of longitudinal models.\nOne of the main strengths of this study is the use of a novel longitudinal method of WMH assessment developed for this purpose. The average image on which a generative model is built enables the reduction of measurement noise and accounts for the within-subject correlation. Accounting for such correlation instead of simply applying cross-sectional methods to serial scans for quantitative assessment has M A N U S C R I P T\nbeen shown to reduce the measurement variability (Reuter, Schmansky, Rosas, & Fischl, 2012) . Furthermore, the creation of an average image in a mid-space overcomes the problem of a bias towards a specific time-point (Fox, Ridgway, & Schott, 2011; Reuter & Fischl, 2011) . Lastly, the use of the generative model to constrain the segmentation at each time point allows subtle changes to be measured while maintaining robustness.\nThis study has a number of limitations. Due to the complexity of the possible biophysiological interactions between amyloid compounds and apolipoprotein, any statistical conclusions should be treated cautiously. As such, CSF level of A\u03b2-42 used as a surrogate disease marker for AD pathology (Andreasen et al., 1999) is also known to be related to WMH (Stenset et al., 2006) . Use of CSF A\u03b2-40 measures, more associated to vascular deposition, may be informative of the pathological process.\nFurther work is thus needed to help disentangle WMH progression and CSF A\u03b2-42 level changes in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Moreover, only global WMH loads were considered here, but regional assessment of the lesion growth and differences in pattern across regions could improve our understanding of the complex relationship between APOE, AD and vascular pathology. Allele \u03b52 carriers were included in this study and results suggested a protective effect of allele \u03b52 but the very low prevalence of this allele makes investigation difficult. Although a similar link between the allele \u03b52 and WMH has been reported (Gesierich et al., 2015) , the very limited number of subjects means our results should be considered very cautiously. In particular, given the 95% CI found for the 42 group (only 6 subjects), the mean negative accrual of WMH cannot be interpreted as significantly different from 0. This is mostly representative of the difficulty to represent relative changes M A N U S C R I P T\nfor very small measured volumes. Caution in the interpretation is also warranted here with respect to the \u03b54 carriers since only 24 homozygous 44 participants were included in the study.\nIn conclusion, this study shows the impact of APOE \u03b54 on the rate of WMH accrual over and above diagnosis of AD. Carriage of a single \u03b54 allele with a complementary allele \u03b53 gave a non-significant additional increase of 3% per year, whereas homozygous carriers had a significant additional increase of 16% per year compared with \u03b53 homozygotes. APOE \u03b54, especially when in the homozygous form, is an important independent factor in the progression of WMH.

As expected, the AD subjects had lower CSF A\u03b2 42 concentrations than control subjects, with the MCI subjects having intermediate values (AD < LMCI < EMCI < NC). CSF A\u03b2 42 concentrations were lower in subjects with an APOE \u03b54 allele (44 < 42< 43 < 33). Although age was comparable across APOE status, EMCI and LMCI were on average younger than NC and AD.\nVolumes using our method and the method from UC Davis at first available measurement were strongly associated (Pearson correlation = 0.9, Spearman = 0.95). Absolute volume differences were apparent between methods with our method typically producing smaller values than UC Davis' method. For low lesion volumes, the geometric mean of the ratio was 0.4 with a 95% reference range of 0.1 to 1.2.

There was evidence (p = 0.016, Model ASTD) that the volume of WMH differed between the diagnosis severity groups, the difference being driven mostly by the low volumes observed in NC compared with the three other groups. Although the mean WMH volume in the AD group was slightly lower than that in the EMCI and LMCI groups, these differences were not statistically significant and the 95% confidence interval for the AD group mean was wide, reflecting the fact that this group contains the fewest subjects. Similar results were seen when the differences between the diagnostic groups were adjusted for APOE status (p-value from joint test of differences = 0.033, Model ASTGD).\nConsidering the A\u03b242 level as a continuous marker also provided evidence of an association (p<0.0005) with WMH volume when adjusting for APOE (Model ASTGA\u03b2).\nAcross APOE status, an increase in WMH volume with the number of \u03b54 alleles was observed, although this was not statistically significant when APOE was considered with or without adjustment for diagnostic group or A\u03b2. In all these models, the associations with age and TIV were significant (p<0.001) and the gender difference was significant for Model ASTG (p=0.013) such that females tended to have more WMH. There was no evidence that diabetes was related to WMH volume, but there [-2.6 ,8.5] in the \u03b53\u03b52 group and -3.2%/year [-14.8 ,9 .9] in the \u03b54\u03b52 group).

The progression in \u03b54\u03b52 group appeared lower than for the \u03b54\u03b53 group, although this was not formally statistically significant (p=0.055). Due to the very small sample size, the CI for the \u03b54\u03b52 group was very large. Adjustment for either diagnostic group (Model ASTGD) or A\u03b2 status (Model ASTGA\u03b2) slightly attenuated the differences between the groups without altering the overall pattern.\nIn the latter model the dependency of the rate of change on the CSF A\u03b2 level was just formally statistically significant (p <0.041 for interaction with time).\nRates of change also appeared to increase with diagnosis severity (AD > LMCI > EMCI > NC) (p=0.03, Model ASTD) ranging from a mean rate of 5.6%/year in the NC M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P T E D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT to 14.8%/year for the AD. This effect was no longer significant when adjusting additionally for APOE status (p=0.18). There was no evidence that diabetes or systolic blood pressure was related to rate of change and the inclusion of these factors as covariates did not materially alter the pattern of results (see Supplemental Material).\nThere was no evidence that the length of follow-up influenced rate of WMH accumulation (p-value > 0.5, all tests).

We observed an increased rate of change in the homozygous 44 compared to the 33 and 43 carriers in a cohort with relatively low vascular risk factors and WMH burden at baseline. This study included healthy control subjects, people with mild cognitive impairment and individuals with an AD diagnosis. These findings were observed independently of diagnosis, and when adjusted for CSF A\u03b242 levels, although the latter adjustment did modify the effect size.\nIn the ADNI study, exclusion criteria were designed to limit the amount of vascular disease using a threshold of 4 on the Hachinski score. Therefore, results obtained from this sample may not necessarily generalize to the population at large. For instance, the change of 22 % per year observed for the APOE \u03b54\u03b54 group might be less likely to occur at higher initial lesion loads (with a larger denominator). The bias towards a vascular-risk free population may further explain why no statistically significant differences at baseline were observed in our sample with respect to APOE status. Compared with the general population, this cohort appears enriched in subjects carrying APOE \u03b54 alleles mostly in the MCI group, which may have helped in extracting relevant patterns and allowed the distinction between heterozygous \u03b54\u03b53 and homozygous \u03b54\u03b54.
