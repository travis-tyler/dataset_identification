[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The COVID-19 disease, resulting from a novel coronavirus, is currently a global threat leading to considerable disease and mortality worldwide. Since November 1, 2020, a total of 46,493,580 confirmed cases, as well as 1,203,902 deaths from COVID-19 in 215 countries and territories have been reported [1] .\nThe Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a close relative of SARS-CoV with 45-90% sequence similarity, which has resulted in the severe acute respiratory syndrome in over 8000 confirmed cases and about 800 deaths in 2003 [2, 3] .\nCoronaviruses are a diverse family of viruses associated with multiple respiratory diseases with different severity, like common cold, pneumonia, and now COVID-19 [4] .With a singlestranded positive-sense RNA genome with genome sizes of 26-32 kilobases (kb) in length, they have the largest known genomes among all known RNA viruses [5] . The virus genome possesses a 5' cap structure together with a 3' poly(A) tail, like an mRNA to translate its proteins. About two-thirds of the genome at 5' end is occupied by the replicase gene, which encoded two polyproteins, ORF1a and ORF1b. These polyproteins are further processed to generate the non-structural proteins (nsp). ORF1a is contributed to produce the nsp1-nsp11, while the rest of nsps (nsp12-nsp16) are originated from ORF1b [6] . Additionally, the viral structural proteins comprise surface (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins encoded by the one-third of genome at 3' end [6, 7] .\nA group of small non-coding RNAs, almost 19-24 base pairs in length, named microRNAs (miRNAs) plays a key role in the modulation of a wide range of biological processes, including J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f development, immune system response, and cell death through gene expression regulation [8] . In addition, various aspects of the viral replication and proliferation, including host antiviral responses and viral pathogenesis can be influenced by miRNAs. MiRNAs mediate their regulatory function through direct binding to the target transcript. Perfect pairing in the seed region (position 2 to 8 from 5' end) has an important impact on the regulatory function of a miRNA. MiRNAs play a negative or positive role in virus-related processes in three ways: direct binding to the viral genome, binding to the viral transcripts, or binding to the host transcripts [9] .Host miRNAs may promote viral RNA stability, replication, and infection or conversely, reinforce host antiviral responses against viruses.\nHowever, the position, number, and distance between binding sites and point mutations in the seed region of a miRNA, can alter its target specificity and its subsequent impact [9] [10] [11] . It has been reported that in the samples infected with H5N1 influenza, miR-485 directly targets the viral PB1 gene coding an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that is essential for virus replication [12] . Moreover, the induction of host immunity pathway like the interferon pathway upon viral infection can result in the enhanced expression of certain miRNA, including miR-155 to regulate the corresponding pathway [13] . For MERS-CoV genome, a total of 13 host miRNAs affecting the virus genome has been recognized, hence, their application as the appropriate therapeutics against viral infection appear promising as microRNAs are very specific in selecting the target regions [14] . Considering the current COVID-19 pandemic, it would be of great importance to investigate miRNAs involved in the host-SARS-CoV-2 interface. In this study, top miRNAs miRanda tool (version 3.3a) was used to predict the potential human miRNA binding sites on the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence [15] . For this purpose, the thermodynamic folding energy and alignment score threshold values of -20 and 150 kcal/mol were set for miRanda tool; the strict alignment in the seed region was also considered with including the strict parameter."}, {"section_title": "Gene expression analysis", "text": "The gene count data derived from RNA sequencing in the lung tissue of COVID-19 patients p-values [17] . Finally, Cytoscape software version 3.7.2 was used to visualize miRNA-mRNA network and important GO term."}, {"section_title": "Host human MiRNAs-SARS-CoV-2 genome interaction", "text": "Among the 2654 human mature miRNAs, 444 miRNAs were identified with direct binding site on different positions along with the coronavirus 2 reference genome (Table S1 ). It was focused on the interactions with perfect matching in the seed region and 160 miRNAs were sorted out. Among them, there was 15 miRNAs with more than three binging sites (Tables 1 and   2 ) and 12 miRNAs bound to the coronavirus 2 reference genome with a free energy (\u0394G) less than -29 kCal/Mol (Tables 2 and 3 )."}, {"section_title": "J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f", "text": "According to the results, miR-29 family (miR-29a, miR-29b, and miR-29c) had the most binding sites (11 sites) and miR-3175 had the least \u0394G (-35 kCal/Mol). The position of binding sites on the SARS-CoV-2 for miRNAs with more than three binding sites or \u0394G less than -29\nkCal/Mol was also explored and ORF1ab, nucleocapsid, spike, ORF3a, membrane, and ORF7a coding regions with high capability for binding to host human miRNAs were found (Fig. 1) .\nORF1ab, nucleocapsid, and spike sequences had the most binding sites. Among the miRNAs, miR-29 exhibited various binding sites on ORF1ab, nucleocapsid, and spike sequences. MiR-21\nhad binding sites on ORF1ab, spike, and ORF3a. The spike region, which encodes the spike protein, is necessary for viral entry and is a promising target for antiviral therapy. Eight binding sites for miR-29a-3p, miR-29c-3p, miR-21-3p, miR-761, miR-3130-3p (2 sites), miR-3167, and miR-3175 were recognized on the spike coding region (Fig. 1) . In particular, the binding pattern of miRNAs among genome sequences released from 10 different geographical locations was explored and no mutation and 100% similarity were found.\nHowever, in previous studies, direct binding of miR-29s to the host A20/TNFAIP3 transcript in response to influenza A and JEV infections, and subsequently, modulation of antiviral and proinflammatory responses have been reported [27] . Considering the high levels of miR-29s in the lungs of healthy adults and better response of these people to SARS CoV-2 compared to those with respiratory diseases with low levels of miR-29s, the probable role of miR-29s in modulating SARS-CoV-2 infection was suggested.\nMiR-21, another SARs-CoV-2 binding microRNA, had four binding sites on the SARS-CoV-2 genome. miR-21 is one of the best known miRNAs whose expression increases in many pathological conditions including asthma, pulmonary fibrosis, and viral infection [32, 33] .\nThere is no report about direct binding of miR-21 on human viral genomes, and current reports about the involvement of miR-21 in viral infections are limited to modulating host transcripts.\nFor example, the positive role of miR-21 in influenza A replication has been attributed to miR-21-host HDAC8 interaction [34] . In addition, it has been shown that miR-21 reduced the antiviral NF-KB pathway through binding to IRAK1 and TRAF6 transcripts in HIV and HCV infections [35, 36] . According to the results of the present study, miR-21 had two binding sites on the spike coding regions. In addition, miR-21 was one of the top miRNAs which targeted upregulated host-DEGs in response to SARS-CoV-2. One of the miR-21 targets is CXCL-10 that is a biomarker for viral, bacterial, fungal, and parasitic contamination [37] . In the present study, suppressed cell cycle and prevented EV71 replication through decreasing CCND1 level, which is an important protein in G1 to S phase transition during cell cycle processes [39] . In the present study, decreased level of CCND1 in the lungs of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 was observed, which seems to be not as effective as its reduction in EV1 infection, because the studied patients died from COVID-19.\nLet-7e and let-7b, two let-7 family members, were also among the top miRNAs targeting host DEGs in SARS-CoV-19. The association between Let-7 family and several viral infections including RSV, influenza A, and hMPV has been demonstrated [40, 41] . Similar to miR-16, Let-7 family also targets CCND1 [42] . In contrast to EV71 infection, the decreased level of replication has been previously reported [43] . In order to retaliate, SARS-CoV encodes a STAT1 antagonist (ORF6) to escape from eradication [44] . Although in this study, increased levels of STAT1 were observed in the lungs of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 but it did not lead to an effective antiviral response. It may be, at least in part, due to an antagonizing strategy by SARS-CoV-2 similar to SARS-CoV.\nIn addition to STAT1, mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase 2 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f "}, {"section_title": "Enrichment analysis of SARS-CoV-2 induced differentially expressed genes (DEGs)", "text": "RNA 3p, miR-186-5p, miR-93-5p, and miR-20a-5p were predicted to target only down-regulated DEGs (Fig. 3B) , and miR-155-5p, miR-146a-5p, miR-24-3p, and miR-21-5p were predicted to target only up-regulated DEGs (Fig. 3B ). MiR-16-5p, miR-484, let-7b-5p, miR-17-5p, miR-106b-5p, let-7e-5p, and miR-320a targets were from both up-and down-regulated DEGs.\nAnalysis of DEGs targeted by miRNAs demonstrated that GO terms and biological pathways related to response to virus, influenza A, antiviral INF-stimulated genes, and positive regulator of NF-\u03baB signaling were significantly enriched (Fig. 3E) . However, the pathways and GO terms related to eukaryotic translation initiation and signaling by interleukins were significantly depleted (Fig. 3F ). miRNA-mRNA network for up-and down-regulated DEGs in response to Figures 4A and 4B , respectively. SARS-CoV-2-induced DEGs related to viral processes were also sorted out and top miRNAs, which target them were explored ( Fig. 3C and D) . According to the results, it was identified that 38 up-regulated (11%) and 77 (17%) down-regulated DEGs were enriched in viral processes. MiR-146a-5p, miR-203a-3p, and miR-24-3p, which were predicted to target 26%, 10%, and 10% of the up-regulated"}, {"section_title": "SARS-CoV-2 infection is illustrated in", "text": "DEGs, were respectively involved in viral processes (Fig. 3C) . Otherwise, 32% and 31% of the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f down-regulated DEGs involved in viral processes, were targeted by miR-615-3p and miR-16, respectively (Fig. 3D) . miRNA-mRNA network for miRNAs that target SARS-CoV-2-induced DEGs involved in viral processes are depicted in Figure 5 ."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Viral proteins have been broadly considered as targets for antiviral therapies, but the problem arises when the selective pressure results in the emergence of a new antiviral drug resistance lineage. Therefore, host-coded factors and particularly, microRNAs seem to be a better strategy [18] . miRNAs as antiviral targets is so important that the first clinical trial of miRNAs relates to their involvement in viral processes [19] . MiR-122, which is highly expressed in liver, binds (Table S1 ) reported in the present study with one binding site on the SARS-CoV-2 genome. However, in this study, it was focused on miRNAs with more than three binding sites on the SARS-COV-2 reference genome. Top miRNAs, which target host-related DEGs involved in viral processes in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, were also predicted. In the present study, the number of binding sites, \u0394G > -20\nKcal, and perfect complementarity in the seed region were considered.\nAmong covid-19-binded miRNAs, miR-29 family had the greatest number of interactions (11 sites). miR-29 family consists of three members, namely, miR-29a, miR-29b, and miR-29c.\nIn previous studies, the impact of host miR-29s on the regulation of viral processes depended on whether they directly bind to the viral genome or to the host transcripts [27] [28] [29] .\nDirect binding of miR-29a to the 3' UTR region of the HIV genome, increased the transport of virus to p-bodies and reduction of HIV replication. Ahluwalia et al. (2008) also reported that the inhibitory impact of miR-29a on HIV infection is mediated through binding to the accessory viral protein negative factor (Nef), which is critical for viral persistence and release [30] .\nTherefore, miR-29a has been considered as a potential therapeutic target for HIV eradication [29] . According to the results of the present study, five miR-29s binding sites were predicted in the spike and nucleocapsid coding regions of SARS-CoV-2. Spike proteins protruded from the viral envelope are responsible and critical for host-receptor binding and viral entry. Nucleocapsid proteins specifically bind to the viral genome and facilitate viral entry, replication, and release.\nBoth spike and nucleocapsid proteins were considered as targets for SARS-CoV-2 antiviral drug development. miR-29s also targeted sequences in the ORF1ab region, which is the largest part of the genome and encoded for 16 nsps [31] . Despite having a large number of direct binding sites on the SARS-CoV-2, no miR-29s was found among the top miRNAs targeting host DEGs."}]
