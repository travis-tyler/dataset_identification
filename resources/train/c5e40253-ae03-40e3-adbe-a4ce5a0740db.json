The study used a longitudinal analysis of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort (ECLS-B).\nSetting. The study was conducted in the United States. Subjects. Participants were children of non-Hispanic white mothers and children of U.S.and foreign-born mothers of Mexican origin from a nationally representative sample of children born in the year 2001 (N ' 3700).\nMeasures. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention growth charts determined sexand age-specific weight status. Covariates were obtained from birth certificate records and parent interviews.\nAnalysis. Frequencies, growth curve trajectories, and ordinary least squares regression examined body mass index (BMI) and obesity across survey waves.\nResults. Compared to their peers with non-Hispanic white mothers, children of Mexicanheritage mothers have higher average BMI and greater rates of obesity. The BMI of boys with Mexican-born mothers is higher relative to whites and children of U.S.-born Mexican mothers across early childhood, increasing sharply at about age 4.5 years. This divergence is driven by increases in the BMI of boys, as girls do not show the same growth. A number of measures, including descriptors of children's nutritional intake, lifestyle factors, and acculturation, do not explain the increased obesity rates among sons of Mexican mothers.\nConclusion. Despite favorable perinatal health and weight, Mexican-American sons of foreign-born mothers show disadvantages in BMI that emerge close to the start of kindergarten."}, {"section_title": "PURPOSE", "text": "Obesity has become a major health concern as body mass levels have risen in the United States over the last several decades. The American Medical Association now recognizes obesity as a disease in hopes of bringing increased awareness and resources to the problem. 1 Childhood obesity is a particular concern because its rise and fall may determine the path to and away from obesity and chronic health problems at later ages: Children who are overweight or obese are more likely to become obese or have health problems in adulthood. 2, 3 Childhood obesity is also of public health import because it may help explain some of the sizable race/ethnic health disparities that persist throughout most of the life course. While nearly 17% of children and adolescents aged 2 to 19 in 2009-2010 were classified as obese, obesity rates were even higher among non-Hispanic black (24.3%) and Hispanic (21.2%) children. Within the Hispanic pan-ethnic group, Mexican-American children show a particularly high prevalence, with a 47% to 81% higher likelihood of being classified as obese relative to their non-Hispanic white counterparts. 4 Researchers looking at childhood obesity are increasingly examining earlier ages to determine the origins of higher weight status. [5] [6] [7] Rates of obesity among preschool-aged children have doubled in recent decades, with nearly one in eight children aged 2 to 5 years in 2009-2010 having a body mass index (BMI) classified as obese. 8 Data from 2008-2011 suggest that the increase has stabilized or reversed among children aged 2 to 5 years in many U.S. states/territories, perhaps due to in-tervention efforts on the part of many agencies and organizations to improve nutrition and physical activity. 8, 9 Despite this apparent progress, the prevalence of obesity is still nontrivial, and the obesity status of older cohorts of children still poses challenges to adult weight and health outcomes.\nEarly childhood also provides an opportunity to determine when and why inter-and intraracial/ethnic disparities emerge. Although the infant health outcomes, including birth weight, of many Latinos are better than expected given their low socioeconomic status (SES), which has been labeled a ''Hispanic health paradox'' (in perinatal outcomes), [10] [11] [12] [13] children of Mexican immigrants have higher BMI than do white children of parents born in the United States as early as age 3 years. 14 Higher BMI, and especially very high BMI levels, may be a meaningful divergence from favorable perinatal health that sheds light on other crossover processes in which immigrant health declines over time (for adult health, see Cunningham et al. 15 ; for child health, see Van Hook and Balistreri 16 ).\nResearch has yet to fully explain these health disparities and, particularly, the timing and mechanisms of high BMI levels among children of Mexican immigrants. The timing is particularly important since Hispanic children show increased obesity much earlier than do black children. 17 However, our identification of this timing is constrained by the developmental context of early childhood. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) do not provide growth standards for overweight or obese until age 2 years 18 ; for children younger than 2, researchers and clinicians use the term ''high weight-for-length,'' rather than ''obese'' or ''overweight'' (for example, Ogden et al. 4 ). We therefore consider birth weight and weight-for-length in infancy, but do not examine these measures as outcomes.\nAcross childhood, genetics and epigenetics, intrauterine exposures, birth weight, diet, energy expenditure, TV viewing, and other factors have been identified as determinants of child obesity levels. 19 In early childhood, birth weight, infant feeding patterns, taking a bottle to bed, mother's weight status, consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, and sleep patterns have all been shown to have associations with children's weight status. [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] While Hispanic children have greater rates of most of these risk factors, 26 these mechanisms do not explain greater BMI among Hispanic or Mexican-American children compared to their white or black counterparts in early or midchildhood. 14, 20, 21 More research is needed to understand how another possible set of mechanisms-measures of immigrant acculturation to societal values, health behaviors, and adaptation to U.S. life more broadly-may lead to the adoption of behaviors and risk factors associated with obesity. There is limited information on the role of family acculturation in shaping children's BMI, especially among ages 2 to 5, and the findings are not conclusive. Mother's age at migration does not appear to be associated with disparities between non-Hispanic white children of U.S.born parents and Hispanic children of foreign-born parents, although living in an English-speaking household is associated with increased risk of obesity. 27, 28 Much of the literature examining childhood obesity controls for race/ ethnicity, nativity, class, and gender, but does not explore their intersectionality, even though prior findings suggest that certain groups experience disproportionate risk factors and rates of obesity.\nOur study aims to advance knowledge on obesity in early childhood, ethnic disparities in child obesity, and the crossover from advantaged perinatal health to disadvantaged health among children of Mexican immigrants. To our knowledge, this study is the first to chart BMI trajectories across early childhood (ages 2-5) for a nationally representative cohort. To accomplish these goals, this study examines BMI across ages 2 to 5 among a nationally representative group of white children of U.S.-born parents, children of Mexican heritage with U.S.born parents, and second-generation Mexican-American children."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Sample", "text": "We used data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort Table 1 . Attrition rates across the ethnic groups were not significantly different. We retain as much information as possible for each analysis, so samples other than the 3700 were used for descriptive information from waves 2 and 3 and growth curve analyses. Wave 2 has fewer children because children under age 2 do not have a defined obesity status, and wave 3 has more children because wave 4 was conducted on an 85% subsample due to budget constraints. Growth curve analyses include any children with two or more points of information. Restricting descriptive statistics and growth curve analyses does not bring about any substantive differences."}, {"section_title": "Measures", "text": "Outcome. Our outcome of interest is BMI, a measure based on child height and weight collected by ECLS-B personnel. We also examine obese status, defined as at or above the 95th percentile of BMI for children of the same age and sex using CDC growth charts. 29 As mentioned above, age 2 years is the youngest we examine because most studies do not interpret higher weight-for-length for younger ages as indicative of obesity or overweight (for example, see Baird et al. 30 ; see Moss and Yeaton 31 for a counterexample).\nRace/Ethnicity and Nativity. As indicated above, we categorize children based on the ethnicity and nativity of their mothers. We include children with non-Hispanic white U.S.-born mothers, Mexican-heritage U.S.-born mothers, and Mexican-born mothers. To be concise, we refer to children of non-Hispanic white U.S.-born mothers as ''white.'' We refer to children of Mexican heritage as Mexican-American, either second generation (Mexicanborn mother) or third generation or more (U.S.-born mother).\nControls. Time-invariant control variables include child sex (1 \u00bc male), birth order (1 \u00bc firstborn), birth weight (very low , 1500 g; low . 1500 g and , 2500 g; normal . 2500 g and , 4000; and high . 4000 g), and weight-for-length percentile in infancy (collected at wave 1 and adjusted for age in months, categorized as between 5th and 95th, below 5th, and above 95th percentiles based on World Health Organization [WHO] growth charts). We use the WHO percentiles for infancy, as the CDC does not provide figures for children under the age of 2 years. We also use the following covariates collected at each wave, with the referent given as the first in each list of categories: child age in months, region (Northeast, South, West, and Midwest), urbanicity (urbanized area [population . 50,000], urbanized cluster [population . 2500 and ,50,000], or rural [population , 2500]), and household SES quintiles (5 \u00bc highest, 4, 3, 2, and 1 \u00bc lowest). These quintiles were based on an ECLS-B-constructed continuous variable that averages standardized scores on mother's occupation and educa-tion, father's occupation and education, and household income.\nBehavioral Risk Factors (Across the Study Period). As a possible explanation for ethnic disparities, we examine behavioral risk factors, including nutrition, practices around food, television watching, sleep, and mother's BMI. A measure of regular consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages is defined as drinking sodas, sports drinks, or fruit drinks that are not 100% fruit juice every day for the last 7 days (waves 3 and 4) or usually drinking these beverages with meals or snacks (wave 2). Frequent fast-food consumption is defined as eating a meal or snack from a fast-food restaurant four or more times per week at waves 3 and 4. At wave 1, parents reported on breastfeeding and solid food consumption, and the data were used to create dichotomous measures of whether the child was breastfed for at least 6 months and if the child ate solid foods before 4 months. Data limitations prevent us from distinguishing exclusive breastfeeding. At waves 1 and 2, parents reported whether the child took a bottle to bed, a factor associated with increased likelihood of obesity. 32 Sleep curtailment has also been associated with higher weight among children, and indicators identified whether the child usually slept less than 10 hours or went to bed past 10 P.M. at waves 3 and 4. 22, 24 A dichotomous variable of watching more than the recommended guideline of 2 hours of television per day was taken from waves 2, 3, and 4. Finally, mother's BMI was captured at each wave. This measure was created using the interviewer's weight measurements at each wave and mother's self-reported height in wave 1. "}, {"section_title": "Additional Risk Factors in", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Analysis", "text": "We first examined wave-specific frequencies of BMI and obesity by gender in each of the ethnic groups (with no controls). We then estimated multivariate growth curve models by gender, examining trajectories of BMI over time after controlling for SES and health behaviors. This approach nests time points within children, with age and age squared as the level 1 units and the individual as the level 2 unit (see Van Hook and Balistreri 16 ). To investigate how ethnic and nativity groups diverge over time, models include terms that interact with Mexican U.S.-born mothers and Mexican foreign-born mothers with age and age squared. Prior research has assessed associations with weight status for children over time, 35 but has not charted these trajectories. These growth curve models use time-varying covariates available at waves 2, 3, and 4 (age, region, urbanicity, SES quintile, mother's BMI), time-invariant covariates that do not change over time (child sex, birth order, birth weight, weight-for-length at wave 1, breast-fed for 6 or more months, received solid food before 4 months), and timeinvariant counts of risk factors that summed the number of waves at which the risk factor was present (sugarsweetened beverage, fast food, too much television, bottle to bed, sleeping less than 10 hours, bedtime past 10 P.M.). While we include possible influences on BMI in these growth models, we do not examine preschool nutrition and child care because they are specific to the middle of the observation period. Multicollinearity prevents us from including acculturation alongside race/ethnicity and nativity categories and including the many possible SES household and neighborhood measures in the growth curve models. To analyze these factors, we perform descriptive statistics among boys of Mexican-origin mothers and regression analysis on sons of Mexican, Mexican-American, and white mothers.\nWe then present descriptive statistics comparing obese and average-weight boys with Mexican immigrant mothers on a range of factors, including the SES and health behaviors presented above as well as the preschool measures described above. We also present results from ordinary least squares regressions predicting wave 4 BMI controlling for wave 3 BMI, focusing on the ages when sons of Mexican immigrant mothers demonstrate the largest increase. Multicollinearity again prevents inclusion of all the different health behaviors, acculturation, and SES measures, but models with different specifications did not produce different results. All analyses account for complex sampling design using probability weights and jackknife replication weights provided by National Center for Education Statistics, except growth curve models that account for probability weights and clustering in primary sampling units. While some families live in the same zip codes, there is not enough clustering to allow for multilevel models nesting individuals in zip codes. Adjusting for complex sampling design accounts for clustering in counties, which were used as sampling units. 36 "}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": "Obesity statistics for each wave are presented in Figure 1 . The percentage of obese children ranges from 14.3% (white males, wave 2) to 36.4% (second-generation Mexican-American males, wave 4). Non-Hispanic white sons and daughters of U.S.-born mothers show relatively similar prevalence rates across the three waves. Sons and daughters of U.S.-born mothers of Mexican heritage display higher rates of obesity, but these rates do not appear to change much over time. In contrast, sons of foreign-born Mexican mothers have a much higher obesity rate in wave 4; daughters do not show this increase.\nBecause of the sharp increase among sons of foreign-born Mexican mothers, we display multivariate, longitudinal analyses of males. We also analyzed girls, but there were no Source: Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort. Notes: Statistics account for probability weights and clustering in primary sampling units. Time-invariant covariates include birth order, birthweight, wave 1 weight for length, count of regular consumption of sugar sweetened beverages, count of fast food consumption 4 or more times per week, count of watching TV more than the recommended guideline, count of taking a bottle to bed, breastfeeding for 6 or more months, eating solid foods before 4 months of age, count of sleeping less than 10 hours, and count of bedtime later than 10 P.M. and time-varying variables include region, urbanicity, socioeconomic status quintile, and mother's BMI.

NH indicates non-Hispanic; Mex-Amer indicates Mexican-American; and gen, generation. significant differences in the rate of change in obesity over time for the ethnic groups, with daughters of Mexican immigrants exhibiting a higher BMI at the start of the study period. The growth models in Figure 2 illustrate the interactions between ethnic/ nativity group and age. Full tables are available upon request. Figure 2A shows trajectories over time for the ethnic groups, without any controls. These patterns should be interpreted within the developmental context of the normal J-shape in body mass gain across childhood. 29 According to the 50th percentile in the CDC growth charts, there is a decline in BMI from ages 2 years to about 5 (girls) or 6 (boys) years, when it begins to rise again. Although most groups evinced this general pattern, the apparent inflexion point where BMI starts rising again began to occur somewhat earlier for sons of Mexican mothers at around age 4.5 years, after which this group also had a higher baseline BMI than white boys. Mexican-American girls had higher BMI than white girls, but did not exhibit this additional jump around preschool age. Figure 2B illustrates trajectories after the inclusion of risk factors and controls that are time invariant or time varying. The inclusion of these covariates equalized BMI over the time period for Mexican-American sons with U.S.-born mothers, but the accelerated increase among sons of Mexican-born mothers remained.\nGiven the BMI risks identified among sons of Mexican-origin mothers, we investigated their demographic, health behavior, and acculturation profiles. Table 2 displays the results of F-tests comparing obese and nonobese members of this disadvantaged group. Obese sons were significantly more likely to be in the lowest SES quintile, have high birth weight, and have a mother with higher BMI. Contrary to expectations that obesity is related to increased acculturation, they also were more likely to have a mother with English difficulties and significantly less likely to have a mother that was a U.S. citizen (or married). Mothers also reported that obese sons drank fewer sugar-sweetened beverages than boys of normal weight. Despite these differences, the other indicators did not 37 In other words, to detect a small effect such as the difference in taking a bottle to bed in wave 2 (odds ratio \u00bc 1.6; Cohen's d \u00bc .26), our sample provides only a power of .5.\nThus, there may be other small differences between obese and normalweight sons of Mexican immigrants. Additional analyses (available upon request) focused on ethnic differences in the period of steep BMI growth. These models predicted boys' BMI at wave 4 (about age 5.5) after controlling for BMI at wave 3 using ordinary least squares regression. Boys with Mexicanborn mothers had significantly higher BMI compared to whites, which was reduced slightly after controlling for SES and birth weight, but persisted beyond the inclusion of behavioral risk factors, type and number of child care hours, and zip code characteristics. Despite the rich set of covariates available in these data, the mechanisms for the differences in BMI did not emerge."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "This study makes several contributions to our understanding of child obesity. First, it highlights young Mex-ican-heritage sons of immigrant mothers as particularly susceptible to higher weight status in early childhood. This finding corresponds to the conclusions of Van Hook and Baker, 38 who investigated differences in the effect of acculturation on boys and girls aged 5 to 11 years. They found that boys with parents raised outside the United States weighed more and gained weight faster, but the same pattern did not emerge for girls. They were not able to test the mechanisms underlying the increased risk among Mexicanheritage boys in middle childhood, but the authors 38(p210) posited that the additional risk may be due to ''gendered beliefs and parenting practices that are more likely to indulge boys.'' Gender is important to understanding family functioning among immigrant families, 39 and boys generally take on less responsibility than do girls in Mexican immigrant households. 40 Mexican parents may view heavier weight status as more favorable or healthier, but a prior study showed that Mexican immigrants' beliefs, attitudes, and knowledge of weight status were similar, regardless of whether their preschooler was below or above the 95th percentile for BMI. 41 Future research should further examine how race/ethnicity, nativity, and gender combine to produce different dimensions of risk.\nSecond, our results establish early childhood as a critical period for the exacerbation of health disadvantage for Mexican-heritage sons of foreignborn mothers. While these children have displayed higher BMI across childhood ages, this study is, to our knowledge, the first to identify the timing of the further widening of the obesity disparity: about age 4.5 years. For many children, this timing coincides with the prekindergarten year, an age when most children enroll in center-based preschools and may experience corresponding changes in diet, exercise, and other health behaviors. Children from Mexican immigrant families are less likely to receive center-based care, 42 which could potentially spur divergent experiences at this age. At around the same age, children are aware of and begin to enact differences related to race, class, and gender, [43] [44] [45] which could shape the emergence of gender disparities in health behaviors. Third, this study points to a complex web of factors that influences child health, which may require more detailed data collection methods. Other research has been unable to identify the mechanisms linking disadvantaged children to higher rates of obesity, and this study produced similar results, despite the focus on early childhood and the inclusion of a wealth of measures describing the children's nutritional intake and other lifestyle factors. However, our data are limited, and we do not have information on patterns of behavior that lead to increased weight gain, such as portion size or physical activity levels. An alternative explanation is inaccurate reporting. For example, mothers may underreport the eating habits of their sons because of social desirability or because they do not realize what they are eating. It is unlikely that reporting differences are due to language difficulties, since ECLS-B provided bilingual interviewers and both Spanish and English programs for computerassisted personal interviewing, and no parents were unable to conduct an interview due to language difficulties. 36 Nonetheless, the socioeconomic and language disadvantages associated with obesity among these young Mexican boys suggest that these families may experience hardships, such as discrimination or stigma, as opposed to experiencing simpler forms of negative ''acculturation'' in which being ''culturally'' closer to the mainstream is related to worse BMI outcomes. 46 The role of language may be particularly salient, as low-proficient Englishspeaking Mexican mothers have disproportionately more obese sons, a surprising finding that parallels that of Van Hook and Baker. 38 There is not a source to use to directly compare Mexican children of the same age in the same year to children in this study (that uses the same obesity thresholds), but similar estimates for Mexican children appear to be lower. 47 Further, unlike their adult counterparts, prior research identifies U.S. exposure as important for children of Mexican immigrants, as children in Mexico with a high propensity for immigration have lower BMI com-pared to both their Mexican counterparts with a lower propensity and Mexican-born children living in the United States. 48 The mechanisms for the influence of parent acculturation-including the disadvantages that produce said acculturation 49 -on weight status among boys of Mexican heritage will be an important research target for the future. The more frequent occurrence of high birth weight (i.e., .4000 g) among Hispanics and the association between high birth weight and childhood body mass 50, 51 suggest that these mechanisms are in place prior to birth, but continue to operate into early childhood since birth weight did not explain racial/ethnic differences in obesity in regression analyses. An additional consideration is gestational diabetes, unmeasured in the ECLS-B, since this condition is associated with increased risk of high birth weight and is more prevalent among Hispanic women. 52 Furthermore, the higher BMI of the Mexican mothers of obese sons points to family-level influences.\nIn conclusion, while this study does not solve the origin of the crossover between favorable perinatal health and weight and unfavorable body mass levels in early childhood, it does push its origin to earlier in childhood. Moreover, this study also contributes to mounting evidence of the existence of an additional obesity bump for secondgeneration Mexican-American boys around preschool age, suggesting that some aspects of Mexican-American health may be worse for the (male) children of immigrants than for third and subsequent generations. Future research should confirm the existence and improve understanding of this generational gap."}, {"section_title": "SO WHAT?
