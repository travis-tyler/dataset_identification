There is increasing discussion and evidence by the scientific community that the climate is changing at an unprecedented rate on a global scale. Along with climate change, comes an increase in occurrence of severe storms that may have adverse effects on humans if we are not prepared. This chapter presents the issues of climate change and the importance of developing adaptation methods, primarily in the area of preparing for the effects of sea level rise. Research questions and objectives are found in the latter section of this chapter."}, {"section_title": "Background and Motivation", "text": "In 2007, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) produced their fourth assessment report showing that there is compelling evidence that points to a warming climate trend (IPCC, 2007a;IPCC, 2007b). The three IPCC working groups issued several key statements found in the synthesis report that further strengthens the connection between human activities and the warming climate system. Greenhouse gas emissions due to human activities have increased at an astonishing 70% between 1970 and 2004. As a result of higher concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, the average global temperature has also increased drastically. The average temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere over the last 50 years have been very likely higher than any other 50 year period over the last 500 years (IPCC, 2007c). Climate change is a trending issue. At the same time, the global population is growing and the resource consumption rate has never been higher. It can be seen that under the most optimistic conditions the Earth has committed to some degree of warming for the near future and the need for humans to adapt is imperative (Etkin, Medalye, & Higuchi, 2012;World Bank, 2012). This raises the question of what climate change brings in terms of a new environment and how communities can anticipate and prepare for it. As the average temperature rises, evaporation rates also increase, adding more moisture into the atmosphere. Naturally the result of an increase in atmospheric vapour is an increase in more drastic and unpredictable weather occurrence. Rising sea level is also consistent with warming temperatures due to thermal expansions, melting glaciers, ice caps and ice sheets. Global average sea level has risen at an average rate of 3.1 mm/yr since 1993, which far exceeds any model projections (IPCC, 2007c). Changes in precipitation patterns and rising sea levels put coastal communities the first in line to witness the effects of climate change. The consequences of sea level rise is an increase in storm surge occurrences as well as much more severe weather phenomena as seen in Hurricane Katrina (August 2005) and Hurricane Sandy (October 2012). The notion of preparedness for natural disasters is a contentious topic of discussion for policy makers. It garners less attention in the scope of policy making, where problems at hand attain greater priority (Jackson, 2008). This is particularly prevalent in less fortunate communities where the list of community problems is extensive. Investing in preparedness for a situation that may or may not happen may seem trivial but with the recent issues and impacts surrounding climate change one may wish to think otherwise. Decision and policy makers are proactive in taking recourse actions after the storm has occurred. Learning from one's mistakes based on real life situations is important but with the tools and technology available in our day and age, decision makers should be proactive in advance. They require better methods to assess preparedness from the resources, strategies, as well as system reliability standpoint. Not only will such a method of assessment aid decision and policy makers, it will also allow the public to set reasonable expectations of their government at all levels and invoke a sense of confidence and comfort in the general population (Jackson, 2008). The C-Change project aims at developing resources for coastal communities to increase their capacity to adapt to and anticipate environmental change. The coastal communities selected for research are spread out across Canada and selected communities in the Caribbean region. Their selection is based on the seriousness and immediate threats to infrastructure if an environmental disaster was to occur (C-Change, 2010). The C-Change project aspires to enhance community capacities and to better prepare for possible environmental disasters. There are other numerous ongoing campaigns to raise awareness about this issue. At the same time adaptive response plans should be in place and well designed to prepare for climate change. This proposed research examines the state of preparedness for coastal communities within the C-Change Project. The following research questions and objectives are proposed."}, {"section_title": "Research Questions and Objectives", "text": "Sea level rise leads to a common occurrence of storm surges in coastal communities. This calls for adaptive response strategies to mitigate the effects of the threatening storm surge. The challenge to designing adaptive response strategies lies in balancing between being cost efficient and being sufficiently prepared. This notion of being prepared is evidently dependent of the magnitude of the storm; therefore another challenge lies in dealing with the uncertainty and varying magnitude of the storm. It is commonly seen that preparedness takes a retrospective approach in planning. Gaps in response strategies are identified and patched post storm. This research project aims at developing a framework to define preparedness for storm surges in coastal communities and develop methods to evaluate response strategies pre-storm. The following research questions were proposed for this study: 1. What does it mean for communities to be prepared for emergency situations? 2. How can this concept of preparedness be applied to coastal communities vulnerable to sea level rise and more frequent severe storms? 3. How effective is the emergency response system in practice? 4. What prescriptions are required to improve preparedness and response reliability? The objective of this study is to develop a framework for coastal communities to assess their level of preparedness in the event of a storm surge. Several steps will be taken to achieve this objective and to provide a means of answering the research questions. These steps will consist of: 1. Examining literature to determine what it means to be prepared for emergency situations. 2. Developing hierarchal indicators of preparedness for applying concepts of preparedness to coastal communities vulnerable to the effects of sea level rise. 3. Constructing a model designed to evaluate the decision making and reliability of the emergency response system for communities. 4. Analyzing the results of the simulation storm mock-up to identify gaps for preparedness improvement for communities. Given recent events, e.g. Hurricane Sandy, the Great Earthquake and Tsunami of the Sea of Japan, many efforts have been made to assess preparedness overall and create a baseline standard that defines preparedness. However, many of these standards tackle the layout and framework for emergency planning. They typically do not include a method of evaluation for deployment and effectiveness of the system in practice. A quantitative modelling approach to determine preparedness provides the missing link in the adoption of community-based storm surge adaptation strategies. Communities would be able to utilize the storm mock-up model to identify gaps in their adaptive response strategy and improve on them."}, {"section_title": "Thesis Proposal Outline", "text": "An outline of the key components presented in each chapter is as follows Chapter 1 -Introduction: The current section provides the background information to climate change as well as the motivation for this study.

The strategy reviews often times put policy makers from all ends of the spectrum in a position to determine at what point one can say that they have achieved preparedness. Often seen in media is that a community was not prepared, however they fail to define what preparedness is and how they measure it to come to such a conclusion. In Chapter 2 we wish to frame the issues behind preparedness for emergency situations in communities. Several key concepts found in literature will be examined along with the different methods in use to define preparedness. To set the stage for the literature review, common terminologies used in the field are presented in Section 2.1. The terminologies are followed by approaches to preparedness as defined by different levels of disaster management organizations in Section 2.2. Numerous attempts have been made to quantify preparedness in the form of a measure or index. These are discussed in Section 2.3. Methods to model storm surge effects and response efforts are shown in Section 2.4. An overview of the applications for this research and a profile of Charlottetown and Isle Madame, which will be used as case studies, are shown in Section 2.5."}, {"section_title": "Terminology", "text": "Community preparedness is a vast topic of study and the terminologies used are often ambiguous or interchangeable due to the immense range of community based programs that exist. The following section identifies key terms and discusses and defines the issues of these terms that are fundamental to this research. The term adaptation that is used in the climate change field has its roots in the field of natural science and specifically evolutionary biology (Smit & Wandel, 2006). Classically, adaptation refers to the evolutionary process involving a genetic or behavioural change in which a population or individual becomes fitted to its prevailing environment (Campbell, et al., 2008). The later part of this definition still hold true in the context of this study, but humans have evolved to a point where genetic makeup can be masked by advancements in technology. Adaptation to a prevailing environment for humans is now dependent on how a population prepares themselves for environmental forces as opposed to an elimination of futile genes. The C-Change project describes adaptation as the capacity of natural and human systems to adjust to global and local environmental change and to reduce adverse effects (C-Change, 2010). The use of the word adaptation in this study will refer to the C-Change definition. The term disaster is commonly used in emergency management. It may refer to a wide variety of disaster types, including cyber-attacks, terrorist attacks, and pandemic disease outbreaks (FEMA, 2007b). The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change defines disasters as severe alterations in the normal function of a community due to hazardous physical events, leading to widespread adverse human, material, economic, or environmental effects requiring immediate emergency response (IPCC, 2007c). Within the context of this study, disasters are of the form caused by sea level rise. Rising sea levels lead to hurricanes, storm surges, and floods. The approaches to preparedness that will be examined in the following section present their method as guidelines, frameworks, or plans to preparedness. Each approach presents a different perspective and method for defining preparedness. In this section terms like capabilities, indicators, goals, priorities, and targets arise. For this study the term indicators will take on the meaning of a quantitative or qualitative identifier to monitor the state of preparedness. Please refer to the glossary for definitions of commonly used terms that are fundamental to this study."}, {"section_title": "Approaches to Preparedness", "text": "Organizations worldwide have taken a proactive approach to developing definitions of preparedness. They range from local community based programs (provincial or territorial Emergency Measures Organization) to international efforts (Hyogo Framework for Action). Local community based programs focus on resources specific to the community at risk while international efforts aim at introducing a holistic approach to defining preparedness worldwide. An overview of the different scopes of preparedness as defined by those in the field would provide a better understanding of what it means to be prepared. In the following section, 5 different approaches to preparedness are examined; National Weather Service's but differ in their approach as well as terminologies. The terminology used in each section is within the context presented by that specific organization's approach."}, {"section_title": "National Weather Service -StormReady Program", "text": "The StormReady program introduced by the National Weather Service (NWS) in 1999 has certified 2056 communities in the United States as of March 31 st 2013 to be \"StormReady\" . The National weather Service is a branch of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The program increases the level of preparedness in the community through a checklist approach that aims at improving the communication and safety skills needed to mitigate storm effects, before and during a storm. The program was created with the intentions of the following as described by NWS (NOAA, 2004): 1. Improve timeliness and effectiveness of weather warnings 2. Provide clear and detailed recommendations to the community 3. Helps community leaders justify budget allocations for emergency preparedness 4. Reward communities that have exemplified what it means to be \"StormReady\" 5. Provide an image incentive for the community 6. Encourage surrounding communities to take part as well Aside from improving community response, the designation also increases property value for the community. From a public relations standpoint, this provides an incentive that encourages all citizens to participate. A set of guidelines were developed to encourage communities to take a proactive approach and improve their response operations. The guidelines touch on the different aspects or dimensions of being prepared as defined by the NWS. They are communication, information reception, hydrometeorological monitoring, warning dissemination, community preparedness and administration . Centre (EOC) in communities with a population larger than 2,500 (NOAA, 2004). This communication point can be established at law enforcement or fire department dispatching points. In the case where a community has neither of these, the use of a county agency is also acceptable. The office must operate 24 hours a day with warning reception capabilities and authority to activate local warning systems. In larger communities, an EOC is required and must be staffed during hazardous weather. Aside from the duties of a warning point, the EOC must also be able to communicate with adjacent communities and act as the messenger between the NWS and community decision makers (NOAA, 2004). receivers with satellite feed to something as basic as a radio or pager system (NOAA, 2004).

StormReady suggests the following means of gathering supplementary weather information: access to radar information via internet, instruments to measure local hydrological conditions, or locally owned and operated weather radars (NOAA, 2004).  (NOAA, 2004). From a different perspective, the last two guidelines are aimed at pre-storm preparation practices. Public education is vital in preparing citizens to respond effectively to weather threats. A more educated community is more likely to take proactive steps to receive warnings and recognize potential threatening weather conditions (NOAA, 2004). The three subcomponents of the community preparedness guideline for the StormReady checklist are: to conduct safety talks for schools, hospitals and industries, facilitate weather related safety campaigns, and send EOC staff to NWS storm spotter training (NOAA, 2004). Lastly, no program will be successful without proper and proactive administration for support. Consequently, StormReady established the last guideline with this concept in mind. The administrative team has to be well organized and be able to effectively communicate with NWS (NOAA, 2004 Numerous residents reported hearing the warnings and took shelter before the storm hit and credited the National Weather Service in issuing the life-saving warnings (NOAA, 2010)."}, {"section_title": "Federal Emergency Management Agency -Target Capabilities List", "text": "In an effort to be better prepared for emergency situations in the United States, the Department of Homeland Security's Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) set out to establish a national policy to prevent, protect, respond, and recover from terrorist attacks, major disasters, and other emergencies. The National Preparedness Guidelines were created in 2007 to define what it means for a nation to be prepared by providing a vision for preparedness, establishing priorities and identifying target capabilities (FEMA, 2007a). The vision for the guidelines was coined as the following; \"A nation prepared with coordinated capabilities to prevent, protect against, respond to, and recover from all-hazards in a way that balances risk with resources and need.\" (FEMA, 2007a, p. 1) The planning process as outlined by the National Preparedness Guidelines is supported by three planning tools; the National Planning Scenarios, Target Capabilities List (TCL), and The National Planning Scenarios portray a diverse set of 15 high-threat scenarios that covers a range of possible situations, including terrorist attacks and natural disasters (FEMA, 2007a). Collectively they were designed to focus on contingency planning at all levels from governments to the private sector and the public. The scenarios were used for identifying tasks required to facilitate efforts in preparing for emergency situations as well as the capabilities required to perform the tasks. A catalogue of these tasks can be found in the UTL (FEMA, 2007c), while a listing of capabilities is found in the TCL (FEMA, 2007b). The TCL contains 37 capabilities that are shown in To answer these questions, a threat analysis was conducted using the 15 National Planning Scenarios. Tasks required to overcome these scenarios were identified and capabilities necessary to perform the tasks were compiled as the TCL (FEMA, 2007b). Each capability summary in the TCL document contains the capability definition and is followed by an outcome statement that describes the expected results to be achieved. The summary includes an identification of the relationship between the capability and the emergency support function. Each summary also contains a description of major activities performed and the critical tasks and measures associated with the each activity. As a method to determine if a community has achieved the target capability, the summary provides metrics associated with the performance measures of that capability (FEMA, 2007b). Performance measures are quantitative or qualitative levels against which achievements of a task or capability can be assessed. It should be noted that they are not normalized, nor are they standards. They are simply a guide for planning and training. The communication capability will be used as an example of the information provided by the TCL document. The capability definition is given as follows: \"Communications is the fundamental capability within disciplines and jurisdictions that practitioners need to perform the most routine and basic elements of their job functions. Agencies must be operable, meaning they must have sufficient wireless communications to meet their everyday internal and emergency communication requirements before they place value on being interoperable, i.e., able to work with other agencies.\" (FEMA, 2007b, p. 29) An example of critical tasks required to meet this capability are (FEMA, 2007b, p. 34"}, {"section_title": "):", "text": "\uf0b7 \"Implement incident communications interoperability plans and protocols\" \uf0b7 \"Implement procedures to protect information facility and communication network systems\" Measures and metrics to determine accomplishment of these tasks are given as the following (FEMA, 2007b, p. 34\n\uf0b7 \"Percent of communications sent and received that are completely understood without ambiguity by the sender or the intended receiver -90%\" \uf0b7 \"Frequency with which communications back-up is provided during emergencies when the conventional mode of communication fails or become overloaded -Continuous\" "}, {"section_title": "UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction -Hyogo Framework for Action", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Strengthening preparedness for effective response", "text": "As part of the fifth priority, strengthening preparedness for effective response, a guidance and indicator package for implementing the framework was created.

The requesting jurisdiction assumes all liability for the out-of-jurisdiction aid and agrees to reimburse the aid provider with all deployment related costs (IEMG, 2009).

To be successful a community needs plans in place to respond, needs equipment that the plans call for as well as personnel to implement the plan. This approach is most easy to follow for decision makers and allows the common public to visualize areas that need improvement (O'Leary, 2004). Shortages in preparedness ingredients can easily be identified from the list of indicators and appropriate actions can be taken. In a sense, it is the most user friendly approach and lays out the requirements clearly (Jackson, 2008).

The NWS StormReady Program, FEMA Target Capabilities List and the Hyogo Framework for Action all take this approach to defining preparedness."}, {"section_title": "Preparedness Indices", "text": "A different approach to defining preparedness is through the use of an aggregated measure or index of preparedness. The creation and use of an index has been a popular methodology for evaluating relative levels of some state, whether economic, health, quality of life or another state of being (O'Leary, 2004;Simpson, 2008). In some cases, there have been indices that attempt to capture levels of social vulnerability to natural hazards (Adger, 1999). exposure and risks to a disaster but not so much for preparedness. They proposed a disaster resiliency index that is a function of vulnerability and preparedness (Simpson & Katirai, 2006). The disaster resiliency index can be considered to be a function of a community's preparedness in a ratio relative to its exposure and a set of hazards. Resiliency and community preparedness are directly proportional (Simpson & Katirai, 2006). The key variables, measures and metrics for such a model are developed using a collaborative and consensus based process among literature in the field. The individual measures used will be determined and weighted from a list of indicators used in previous literature. The indicators will be identified as either a functional measure of preparedness (FM) or a vulnerability measure (VM). Once these measures have been identified and selected from previous literature, they can scaled and normalized to fill the following equations (Simpson & Katirai, 2006).

It is evident that having the right quantity of equipment or personnel is essential for a community to be prepared. Without the right tools the operation would not be able to succeed. Other efforts have gone beyond inventorying resources to developing preparedness standards to assess less tangible components of preparedness. These efforts generally produce an action plan or framework for response. They can be viewed as the instruction manuals providing guidance on how to proceed in the case of an emergency. At this stage, the tools and instructions are both evident as modules of preparedness. With an excess of resources and an optimal response plan, communities still lack a response to the fundamental question of: How certain can we be that the systems we have put in place to respond to storm surges will be able to deliver when called upon? The answer to this question lies in evaluating the effectiveness or reliability of the system once it is in practice. Confidence that response plans will be able to execute effectively depends on the reliability of the system that is executing these plans (Jackson, 2008;Jackson, Sullivan, Willis, & Goulka, 2009). Emergency preparedness plans can be deceiving in many cases. In theory, access to aid supplies and a plan to deliver them to areas in need is a great preparedness strategy. However, if these areas of need are only accessible by a single road that can easily wash out in the event of a storm then the plan is no longer as relevant to the overall preparedness state. The RAND Corporation has brought light to this issue by proposing that response reliability should be evaluated as part of preparedness measurement efforts. Such assessments should be based on the nature of the system of organizations, governments and public and the factors that contribute to how well they respond as a whole. The RAND Corporation suggested mapping the system and identifying the elements that shape the performance of a given task. In other words, the capabilities are mapped with factors that may interrupt the process. Reliability measures can be tabulated by estimating the likelihood of breakdowns and identifying their impact on performance of the system (Jackson, 2008; Jackson, Sullivan, Willis, Figure 2-4 is an example of a fault analysis for identifying risks to evacuation reliability using buses."}, {"section_title": "Figure 2-4 Example fault tree for the analysis for identifying risks to evacuation reliability.

Today, with a population of 34,562 residents (2011 census), Charlottetown is the centre of industrial and commercial activity in the province (C-Change, 2011a). The tourism industry is most prominent in the region and is most strong during the summer months when tourists flock the city for cultural events. Culturally the city is known for its numerous summer festivals that include a Jazz and Blues Festival, Festival of Lights and The International Shellfish Festival. Historically, it was the gathering place for the Charlottetown Conference in 1864 that ultimately lead to the Canadian Confederation (C-Change, 2011a). Geographically, the city is situated on the Charlottetown harbour forming a rough Vshape pointing south. The harbour opens into the Northumberland Straight and is constrained by the North (Yorke) and the Hillsborough (East) Rivers to the west and east. Aside from being surrounded by waterways, Charlottetown has an impressive amount of green space and parks (approx. 400 acres). They provide residents and tourists with many passive or active experiences depending on their interests (C-Change, 2011a).

In an effort to answer these questions, a methodology is proposed in this chapter to define storm surge preparedness in coastal communities and to evaluate its effectiveness. Several pre-existing tools and literature findings will be integrated with a proposed simulation mock-up exercise to evaluate storm preparedness. Initially the components of preparedness specific to coastal communities will be defined. Defining is followed by creating a preparedness taxonomy table to systematically classify the characteristics of preparedness and develop a comprehensive list of indicators relevant to coastal communities. The response process and dynamics is presented in Section 3.3 followed by methods for selecting best decisions in Section 3.4. The simulation process is presented in Section 3.5 followed by the methodology for creating a mock-up exercise in 3.6."}, {"section_title": "Defining the Components of Preparedness", "text": "From the literature reviewed, there exist many different approaches to defining preparedness. Within the context of this study, preparedness for storm surges in coastal communities will be examined. Organizations from different levels of governance have attempted to define preparedness. They range from the global, as seen in the Hyogo Framework for Action, down to the municipal/community level as seen in the Municipal Emergency Management Guide of Prince Edward Island. The definition of preparedness was also shown from an all-hazard approach for most of these organizations. Before redefining specific to storm surges and coastal communities, one must integrate these components. Preparedness is often defined by indicators, a quantitative or qualitative identifier to monitor the state of a process. As seen from before, organizations have attempted to develop a baseline count of the resources required to be prepared. This method produces a tangible inventory list of the equipment and supplies required in the time of a disaster. Examples of quantifiable resources are the number of fire trucks, police officers, water level monitoring sites, and shelters. The other perspective that is often seen in defining preparedness is to develop a response plan. These are often described as guidelines, frameworks, plans or protocols for response. Without actually deploying the system, one can say that given the correct tools (resources) and the instructions (response plans) one can be prepared for an emergency situation. This study aims to take it one step further and assess the decision making and the reliability of the system. Once an emergency event occurs, decision-makers are tasked with deciding on how to respond and how to apply the resources and response plan.     table shown in Table 3-1 based on the characteristic they aim to address. Overlaps in the preparedness frameworks and unique elements can be easily identified from the table once completed. The aim for this study will be to identify an exhaustive list of characteristics of preparedness from the different framework approaches. A draft of the characteristics is presented as part of the table. Elements may be moved around or added during this study. The characteristics will serve as the definition to the question of what it means to be prepared specific to coastal communities and storm surges. From the characteristics, indicators can be formulated to portray the dynamic behaviour of the characteristics. The indicators will then form the grounds for creating sub-indicators of preparedness that are community specific. Indicators are a quantitative or qualitative identifier to monitor the state of a process or in this case, preparedness.

Each characteristic will carry with it a set of indicators that enables gauge the state of preparedness.

"}, {"section_title": "Process Definition and Dynamics", "text": "As a method to evaluate all four components of preparedness, a decision tree/response process is proposed. The simulation program will walk the responders through a series of events where decisions, storm events, and system reliabilities will dictate the outcome and next stage of the simulation. The decision tree/response process will commence with the storm event followed by the responder decision. As shown in Figure 3-4, several storm types can be generated and these are given as S1, S2,... S5. The decision tree process presented shows up to 5 different storm types. They can differ based on atmospheric pressure, radius of maximum winds, location, direction and forward speed. Depending on the storm type and impacts it may carry, responder will be required to make an initial decision. Decisions can be facilitated by the emergency response plan, and the dynamically changing inventory of resources available. The indicators will define what the community responders are capable of doing to mitigate the storm effects. The next event presented will commence phase two of the mock-up exercise where the event put forward will depend on the previous decision made, the progression of the simulated storm and the reliability of the system. This process continues until the objective of the response mission is accomplished or the storm has ended. Once the storm has ended the mock-up exercise will provide an expected value of damage for the storm. These values are for the exercise simulation purpose only and may not reflect reality. They enable the responders to compare between decisions made or not made in the progress. In an effort to create a general framework for storm surge mock-ups in coastal communities, an inductive approach is proposed. By creating scenarios for specific cases one can gain a generalized concept of the framework after numerous cases have been examined. Through the process of integration, one may develop a simulation process that incorporates a comprehensive list of possible decisions and scenarios.

Decision making in the time of an emergency can be stressful due to inexperience and time constraints. This exercise allows responders to thoroughly review their decision criteria and test it against a simulated program. A single best decision route can be charted based on the expected values at the end of the mock-up. However, the best decision route cannot always be selected due to the inherent probabilistic nature of the elements involved. The storm type, reliability probabilities, and dynamically changing resources will force the responders to be creative in navigating the decision tree. This exercise will spur discussion and allow responders to discuss decisions at each stage. For that reason, best decisions are situation dependent and after running the mockup several times a \"best decision\" given a situation approach can be recorded. Gaps in emergency response plans can be identified through a tabletop discussion and guidance on situational decision making can be added to the plan."}, {"section_title": "Process Simulation", "text": "The mock-up exercise will be constructed using Rockwell Arena Simulation software.

The initial state of the countable resources and response plans will be the tools that responders have to work with. The spatial inputs will come in the form of the community architecture and the layout of the location. For example the number of roads leading into area requiring assistance is a spatial input. The model outcome will be dependent of human decisions by responders involved, the SLOSH storm simulation and the reliability of certain processes. The reliability probability values will be generated by the mock-up simulation designer based on a risk analysis of the response process.

In this section, the process of designing, developing, conducting and evaluating the mock-up exercise will be discussed. Given the tools developed from earlier methodologies, the concepts of preparedness and models will be applied to response training exercises. Emergency Management Ontario suggested 5 phases of building an exercise. The 5 phases are shown in Figure 3-6. Creating a foundation for the exercise in phase 1 includes identifying a planning team, scheduling meetings with the community to be studied, establishing project timelines and determining the availability of resources to design and implement the exercise. At this stage it is important to establish needs and requirements of the user (Emergency Management Ontario, 2010).  The third phase the mock-up exercise building is to conduct the exercise and includes setup, briefing, and facilitation. For this study, a table top exercise will be conducted and is therefore isolated from the public. In an exercise of larger scales where the public may be involved, everyone must understand the difference between what is real and what is simply for training. There should be call off signal in the event that responders are required to abandon the exercise and respond to a real situation (Emergency Management Ontario, 2010).
