[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The influence of socioeconomic (SES) inequalities on brain and cognitive development is a hotly debated topic. However, previous studies have not considered that genetic factors overlap with SES. Here we showed, for the first time, that SES and EduYears-PGS (a score from thousands of genetic markers for educational attainment) have independent associations with both cognition and global cortical surface area in adolescents. EduYears-PGS also had a localized association in the brain: the intraparietal sulcus, a region related to non-verbal intelligence. In contrast, SES had global, but not regional, associations, and these persisted throughout adolescence. This suggests that the influence of SES inequalities is widespread -a result that opposes the current paradigm and can help inform policies in education.\nGenetic factors and socioeconomic (SES) inequalities play a large role in educational attainment, and both have been associated with variations in brain structure and cognition.\nHowever, genetics and SES are correlated, and no prior study has assessed their neural associations independently. Here we used polygenic score for educational attainment (EduYears-PGS) as well as SES, in a longitudinal study of 551 adolescents, to tease apart genetic and environmental associations with brain development and cognition. Subjects received a structural MRI scan at ages 14 and 19. At both time-points, they performed three working memory (WM) tasks. SES and EduYears-PGS were correlated (r = 0.27) and had both common and independent associations with brain structure and cognition. Specifically, lower SES was related to less total cortical surface area and lower WM. EduYears-PGS was also related to total cortical surface area, but in addition had a regional association with surface area in the right parietal lobe, a region related to non-verbal cognitive functions, including mathematics, spatial cognition, and WM. SES, but not EduYears-PGS, was related to a change in total cortical surface area from age 14 to 19. This is the first study demonstrating a regional association of EduYears-PGS and the independent prediction of SES on cognitive function and brain development. It suggests that the SES inequalities, in particular parental education, are related to global aspects of cortical development, and exert a persistent influence on brain development during adolescence."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Adolescence is a critical phase in neural and cognitive development during which much of adult trajectories are shaped, yet there is still much we don't know about the environmental and genetic influences during this period [1] [2] [3] .\nSocioeconomic status (SES) inequalities have been associated with differences in executive function, memory, emotional regulation and educational attainment [1] [2] [3] . SES is also associated with functional and structural neural differences in a wide range of cortical areas, including those underlying higher cognitive functions [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . Although SES is commonly assumed to represent a purely environmental factor, large portions of variability in SES can be explained by additive genetic factors 9 . SES explains 9-25% of educational achievement, half of which is suggested to be genetically mediated 10, 11 . Genetic differences are thus a confound not adequately addressed by prior studies of SES and neural development 12 .\nRecent advances in behavioral genetics have identified substantial genetic associations with educational attainment. In a genome-wide association study with 1.1 million individuals, Lee and colleagues 13 described a polygenic score (EduYears-PGS) which explained up to 13% of the variance in educational attainment. That represents the best composite of genetic variants currently known for educational attainment, and many of these variants are relevant for brain development and show tissue-specific expression in the cerebral cortex. Therefore, while SES is a strong environmental predictor for educational attainment, EduYears-PGS is a powerful genetic predictor. And at least some of the impact from these two predictors is likely to overlap and to be via cognition.\nHere we evaluated the independent associations of SES and EduYears-PGS in a longitudinal study of brain development and cognitive function in 551 adolescents. A major strength of our sample is that it was specifically designed to include poor communities for an accurate range of SES inequalities 14 . Adolescent age was around 14 at the first timepoint, and 19 at the second time point, a time-span that captures secondary education. We chose working memory (WM) as a measure of cognitive function since it is highly correlated with academic ability and was available at both timepoints 15 .\nGenetics and environment effects could either be manifested in local cortical regions, such as a specific prefrontal area, or they could have global effects, for example via a molecular mechanism that involves most cortical neurons. The distinction is important because it tells us about the potential mechanisms in play, has functional consequences for the individual and could have implications for remedial interventions. Therefore, we tested for distinct global and regional associations -a practice still ignored in the literature 4, 5, 8 , with the exception of only one known study to date 16 . The latter, however, did not control for any genetic component of SES.\nWe defined SES as a combination of income, education, and neighborhood quality. A single, combined SES component allowed for better comparison with EduYears-PGS (itself a single, genetic composite) and was hypothesized to increase power to detect associations in case of additive influences from each SES-related factor. A combined measure also makes our results more interpretable in light of the broader SES literature (most of it also uses composites scores). Yet, recent research has highlighted issues and limitations arising from using SES as a composite measure 17 . Therefore, in a post hoc analysis, we split our SES composite into parental education, income-related stresses, and neighborhood quality to evaluate how these components contributed to our main findings from the analysis of the combined SES measure.\nWe used a bivariate latent change score model (bLCS) to analyze the independent relationships of EduYears-PGS and SES on cognition and global measures of cortical thickness and surface area at age 14 and on the amount of change until 19 while controlling for age, gender, and scan site. Second, to examine regional associations in the cortex, we used cluster corrected vertex-wise analyses to isolate independent variation related to SES and EduYears-PGS, while controlling for respective global values."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Cognitive associations in Early Adolescence", "text": "Data from 551 adolescents recruited by the IMAGEN consortium (https://imageneurope.com) were included.

We found that SES and EduYears-PGS were significantly and positively correlated (r = .27, p < .001). SES had a positive and significant association to WM, even when correcting for EduYears-PGS (\u03b2 = .23, p < .001). Splitting SES into subcomponents revealed that only parental education was significantly associated with WM. EduYears-PGS also had a positive, independent, although weaker relationship, with WM at 14 (\u03b2 = .11, p < .05).\nTwo subtests of an IQ test (WISC, perceptual reasoning and verbal comprehension) were available when participants were 14 years old, but not at 19. The results from both subtests mirrored the results from WM with significant, independent relationships for both SES and EduYears-PGS (SI Appendix, Tables S1 and S2)."}, {"section_title": "Global Surface Area in Early Adolescence", "text": "Global surface area in 14-year-olds was significantly associated with both SES (\u03b2 = .18, p < .001) and EduYears-PGS (\u03b2 = .12, p < .01), each contributing unique variance. Both associations were positive with a stronger association for SES ( Fig. 2 ). As expected, surface area and WM were both correlated at age 14 (r = .17, p < .01). A linear model showed a relationship between surface area and gender, yet there was no interaction between gender and SES (see SI Appendix, Table S3 ).\nAn important question on SES and brain development is whether results only hold for certain SES levels or whether it is linear for all ranges of SES. To evaluate this, we fitted models with the natural logarithmic and a 3 rd degree polynomial for SES. In comparison to the linear model (AIC = -1161), neither the logarithmic (AIC = -1161) nor the polynomial model (AIC = -1157) showed improved model fits. There was thus no evidence of nonlinearity in our sample."}, {"section_title": "Regional cortical associations in Early Adolescence", "text": "Next, we investigated regional cortical associations of SES and EduYears-PGS with surface area at age 14. In this analysis, we corrected for total surface area, age, sex and scanning site. A vertex-wise analysis (CFT < .001, CWP < .05) identified one cluster, uniquely related to EduYears-PGS, located in the right intraparietal sulcus, partly covering the top of the supramarginal gyrus (309 mm 2 , [x = 49, y = -42, z = 39], p < .05) ( Fig. 3 ).\nSES did not have any regional associations at age 14 when covarying for total surface area. Figure 4 illustrates this finding by showing uncorrected, vertex-wise, surface maps in which the mean image of all subjects 1 SD above the means for SES and EduYears-PGS (analyses are done separately for the two measures) are subtracted from the mean image of all subjects 1 SD below the mean (SES-low n=83, SES-high n=86, PGS-low n=79, PGS-high n=80). To obtain representative mean and standard deviations of random data, this procedure was repeated 10,000 times on randomly sampled data without replacement (groups n = 85). Consistent with the statistical analyses, these maps and histograms suggest that almost all the cortex was related to SES inequalities. Firstly, this finding is clearly shown by the density histogram of SES, in which almost every vertex value is above zero (i.e., the mean of randomly sampled data) ( Fig. 4a ). To further illustrate this widespread cortical association, we took all vertex values from one hemisphere to produce a square, 2-dimensional flat-map which contained all data from the hemisphere in one matrix (Fig. 4b) . We thereby reduced topographical information (i.e., localization to brain regions) in order to only focus on size and distribution of relative increases and decreases in surface areas. This resulted in 3 flat maps (random, EduYears-PGS and SES), the color bar was constrained to the minimum and maximum values of random data."}, {"section_title": "Adolescent Development in Cognition", "text": "There was significant improvement in WM from age 14 to 19 (\u03b2 = 2.31, p < .001) and this was more pronounced in the subjects with lower WM scores at age 14 (r = -0.59, p < .01). However, inspection of the distributions and variation of performance on the WM tasks at the second timepoint suggested that there were ceiling effects, which could artificially lead to subjects who performed well at age 14 having less room for improvement. SES was not related to change in WM (p > .05), but EduYears-PGS was (\u03b2 = -.27, p < .05)."}, {"section_title": "Adolescent Development in Surface Area", "text": "Next, we investigated global changes in surface area over the course of five years.

On average, there was a significant decrease in total surface area over five years (-4057mm 2 , p < .001, paired t-test; SI Appendix, Fig. S6a ). SES, but not EduYears-PGS, was significantly related to change in surface area (\u03b2 = -.15, p < .01).\nSubtracting each individual's surface area at age 14 from their surface area at age 19 removes inter-individual differences in total surface area. However, prior studies have shown that change is dependent on point of departure, as subjects with higher initial surface area show larger change 18 . Therefore, we performed regional analyses both with and without correction for total surface area at 14. Using vertex-wise subtracted images, we found a cluster in left caudal superior frontal sulcus (138 mm 2 , [x = -28, y = 10, z = 48], p < .05) significantly associated with SES (SI Appendix, Fig. S4 ). This cluster was no longer significant when covarying for global surface area at 14.

We found that although genetic and environmental determinants of educational attainment are correlated, they carry independent influences on cognition and brain development. Both SES and EduYears-PGS were related to total cortical surface area at age 14, with SES having only a global association, while EduYears-PGS also had a regional association with cortical surface area in the right intraparietal sulcus.

This independent SES result is similar to one found by a meta-analysis for educational achievement (r = .3) 11 . The IQ-subtests displayed the same pattern, showing that the associations were not specific for WM, but likely reflect a general effect on cognition. This is consistent with the well-known correlation between educational attainment and IQ 19, 20 and underscore the value of WM as a suitable and meaningful measure of adolescent cognition and cognitive development."}, {"section_title": "Brain structure in early adolescence", "text": "The strong relationship observed between SES and global surface area at age 14 is consistent with prior findings 4, 8 . There are multiple potential mechanisms mediating an effect of SES on brain development, including stress and glucocorticoids during pregnancy, toxins, premature delivery, maternal care, lack of cognitive stimulation and chronic stress during childhood and adolescence 6, 21 . Those factors might exert their influence via brain functioning and possible epigenetic mechanisms. Reward signals and selected epigenetic markers have indeed been discussed as possible malleable neurobiological markers being associated with cognitive capacity in adolescents 22 . However, to date, one epigenome-wide analysis for educational attainment casts doubt on possible epigenetic markers for educational attainment 23 . The global result we observed could come from one or several factors with a global impact or be the result of several regional effects that together impact most of the cortex with wideranging behavioral outcomes 24 .\nAfter correcting for global surface area, there were no regional associations with SES. Similarly, no clusters were significant when total intracranial volume was corrected for instead of global surface area. Although several studies report regional findings of SES on surface area and cortical thickness 4, 8 , these studies did not correct for global associations. A post-hoc analysis of our data showed that if the global differences are not controlled for, several clusters reach significance, in agreement with prior studies (SI Appendix, Fig. S5 ).\nContrasting the surface area in high vs low SES subjects ( Fig. 4) , it is clear that almost the entire cortex is related to SES inequalities. Without total surface area correction the regional associations can give a false sense of localization 25, 26 . We view it as more accurate to describe the association of SES on surface area as global in nature, where regional effects over-and-above this global effect cannot be statistically distinguished from noise.\nEduYears-PGS was associated with global surface area, consistent with prior findings showing a relationship between EduYears-PGS and intracranial volume 27, 28 . This was expected for our polygenic score for educational attainment, given that both intracranial volume and total surface area were also shown in the past to correlate with IQ 18, 29 . In addition, here we found that EduYears-PGS was related to regional surface area in the intraparietal sulcus.\nRegional cortical findings are consistent with the fact that some of the genetic markers from the EduYears-PGS are associated with regional gene expression 13 . The intraparietal sulcus is a region typically associated with nonverbal reasoning, visuospatial WM, and mathematics [30] [31] [32] . Gray matter volume 33, 34 and brain activity [35] [36] [37] of the intraparietal sulcus predicts current and future mathematical skills in children and adolescents.\nA study spanning 6-18 year-olds found that the right anterior intraparietal sulcus was associated with visuo-spatial WM at younger ages, and later during development associated with mathematics, suggesting a functional plasticity of this region 38 . Given that both nonverbal reasoning, WM and mathematics are predictors of future educational attainment, it is of particular note that our data show the intraparietal sulcus to be specifically associated with EduYears-PGS above and beyond the polygenic influences on global cortical surface area.\nWe found no association between EduYears-PGS or SES with cortical thickness, in agreement with some previous studies on SES 4 , but not others 5, 8 . It is important to emphasize that our quality control procedure was very strict and previous literature has shown cortical thickness results to change based upon strictness [39] [40] [41] . This reasoning, combined with our large sample size and our findings for surface area, lead us to interpret this as an important null result."}, {"section_title": "Adolescent Development", "text": "Over the course of five years, we found a global decrease in surface area. The amount of decrease was related to SES, but not EduYears-PGS, showing a continuing relationship of SES on brain development during adolescence. Although SES's association with surface area at age 14 was positive, this relationship flipped (i.e. became negative) for the change over five years (Fig. 1) . This is likely related to the non-linear developmental trajectories of surface area during childhood and adolescence with an inverted u-shape (typically a loss of surface area starting in adolescence) where height and delay of the peak can differ between individuals as well as between brain region 24, 42, 43 .\nThere was an association between SES and regional change in the left caudal middle frontal gyrus, but this did not survive correction for global surface area at age 14. The interpretation of this regional finding is therefore unclear.\nOne of the benefits of using a bLCS model is that it allows us to examine the influence of baseline measures (e.g., surface area and WM at 14) on the change of those measures. Interestingly, higher WM, independent of surface area at 14, and after correction for SES and EduYears-PGS, was related to a decrease in global surface area during adolescence. Recent research has shown intra-individual change in cognition associated with later change in surface area 44 . An accelerated reduction of surface area during development has previously been observed in higher IQ subjects 18 . In summary, SA typically decreases during adolescence. Higher WM enhances this decrease, suggesting that it is a beneficial developmental process blunted by low SES.\nWM at age 14 also negatively predicted the amount of WM change over adolescence. However, due to some ceiling in our WM tasks at the second time-point (an inherent problem in longitudinal studies), we interpret this result with caution. If this result reflects a true effect, it could represent a catch-up -subjects with lower WM show greater gains in WM during adolescence. However, a previous study of PGS and SES on IQ showed a widening gap between subjects with low and high EduYears-PGS 45 . At least in part, our results here could alternatively be explained by ceiling effects, which could artificially lead to high performing subjects having less room to improve."}, {"section_title": "Limitations and SES subcomponents", "text": "As in most studies that use PGS, we were technically restricted to analyzing only subjects of European ancestry, so our results here cannot generalize to other ethnicities. Additionally, our study focused on environmental and genetic predictors of the trait educational attainment. Therefore, our SES measure is \"pure\" in the sense that we removed some of the genetic variation associated with educational attainment present in the teenagers (and that other studies typically confound). Importantly, however, this controlling does not mean that our SES measure is environmentally pure -there are other potential genetics factors associated with SES, such as genes modulating other traits correlated with SES, as well as parental genes for educational attainment that were not passed down to the teenagers but that helped shaping the environment where they grew up 46 .\nIt is also worth noting that the SES composite we used here is a combination of many distinct SES-related components. When splitting this into education, income, and neighborhood components, we found that most of the SES findings in our sample are driven by the level of education of the parents. We were surprised that even after controlling for the best composite of genetic variants currently known for educational attainment (EduYears-PGS from the largest GWAS to date), the education of the parents was still associated with WM and brain structures in our models. Possible environmental factors might be study habits, cognitively stimulating environments or books in a household but might also be diet and stress, all of which are related to higher education. It would be of interest to further study the specific environmental and nontransmitted genetic factors related to cognitive and brain development."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Here we report, for the first time, distinct associations of EduYears-PGS and SES on cognition, brain structure, and adolescent brain development.

The subjects' age and gender were regressed from all observed behavioral and neural measures in both timepoints before model fitting. For the hippocampus and amygdala analyses total intercranial volume was also corrected for. All models have strict measurement invariance; intercepts, loadings and error variance were constrained to be equal across time. Prior to fitting a bLCS model we assessed fit on respective measurement models. If estimates present Heywood cases (negative error variances) we left them unconstrained as long as the null hypothesis could not be rejected with the use of confidence intervals 64 . Any model presented will have a positive upper bound confidence interval; we chose this approach since constraining variance can lead to unintended consequences 64, 65 . Each SES sub-component was individually substituted for the SES composite in all models, p-values were FDR corrected for the novel tests (see SI Appendix, Table S5 )."}, {"section_title": "Vertex-wise exploratory analysis", "text": "An inherent goal in vertex-wise exploratory analysis is anatomical localization therefore we corrected for global values (i.e., total surface area and average cortical thickness). Correcting for global values in the analysis at age 14 allowed us to detect regional areas that are unrelated to the overall global effects (see discussion for further elaboration). Linear models were fit for each vertex in Freesurfer using Monte Carlo based cluster-wise correction with a cluster-forming threshold of .001, a cluster-wise alpha of .05 and Bonferroni correction for making two independent tests for the two hemispheres 66, 67 .\nWe used two linear models to probe regional specificity of SES and EduYears-PGS, one for subjects at 14 and another on the vertex-wise subtracted images (age 19 subtracted from age 14). Both models were fit for SA and CT separately, resulting in a total of 4 analyses. In the model at age 14 vertices were predicted by the EduYears-PGS and SES while being controlled for mean value of the modality analyzed, gender, age at the first scan and gcut. Gcut is a dummy variable coding for subjects who needed stricter skull strip processing to pass quality control. Subtracted vertices were predicted by SES and EduYears-PGS while being controlled for gender, between scan interval and gcut."}, {"section_title": "Data availability", "text": "It was not part of the written consent of the participants for the data to be publicly shared.

Random data were selected by random sampling without replacement (n = 85 for each group). The two groups were then separately averaged vertex-wise and subtracted from each other. This was repeated 10,000 times to calculate an average random mean and standard deviation. To produce plots for random data the first representative sample was chosen."}, {"section_title": "Figure Legends", "text": ""}]
