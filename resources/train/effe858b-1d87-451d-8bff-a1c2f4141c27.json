[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "This is a new report that combines the previous Annual Accountability Report and University Work Plans into one new document that is more closely aligned with the Board of Governors' 2025 System Strategic Plan. This revised document will enhance the System's commitment to accountability and strategic planning by enabling comparisons between past goals and actual data to better assess performance. This change will help foster greater coordination between institutional administrators, University Boards of Trustees and the Board of Governors. Once an Accountability Plan is approved by each institution's respective Boards of Trustees, the Board of Governors will review and consider the plan's narrative strategy, metric goals and enrollment plans for potential acceptance of 2016-17 components. Longer-term components will inform future agendas of the Board's Strategic Planning Committee. The Board's acceptance of this Accountability Plan does not constitute approval of any particular component, nor does it supersede any necessary approval processes that may be required for each component (e.g., new academic programs). The University's primary market continues to be African Americans and other underrepresented minorities. The University will continue to increase its efforts to attract students of all races, while strengthening its position as a leading producer of African American graduates through the use of more strategic and focused approaches for: a) attracting wellqualified students; b) increasing student success; and c) improving employment outcomes. This will necessitate a continued focus on retention, student progression and graduation, and quality of instruction. As the University works to implement the 2017-2022 strategic plan (FAMU Rising), an increased focus will be placed on recruitment, retention, student progression and graduation, and quality of instruction. Specific strategies and initiatives include: 1. Increasing FTIC retention and graduation rates by overhauling the campus student advisement structure, expanding the use of high-impact practices, leveraging the use of technology, and increasing resources for faculty development. 2. Increasing licensure pass rates by revising curricula, expanding academic support services, enhancing admissions policies, and expanding faculty development. 3. Increasing the enrollment of AA transfers by strengthening partnerships with FCS institutions via specialized 2+2 articulation agreements. 4. Enhancing the overall student experience by upgrading student housing and instructional facilities, improving the coordination and quality of student support BOT Approved 06/07/2018 services via the construction of the Center for Access and Student Success (CASS), and expanding co-curricular activities. 5. Strengthening and expanding academic program offerings in high-demand areas to address Florida's workforce needs. 6. Enhancing student recruitment efforts by restructuring the Enrollment Management unit and implementing a strategic recruitment plan. 7. Increasing faculty productivity by increasing resources for faculty development and research, and evaluating faculty workload. 8. Improving customer service by launching a comprehensive Service Excellence Program. 9. Transitioning to a more data-driven culture and increasing the efficiency of University operations by enhancing oversight and management of academic, fiscal and critical business operations. 10. Increasing financial support for the University through enhanced alumni and community engagement.

Core capabilities: FAMU is a doctoral/research institution and is one of the top Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) in the nation. Key institutional strengths include its diversity in academic program offerings and array of accredited professional programs; recognition as one of the nation's top producers of African American graduates; status as an 1890 land-grant institution; designation by Carnegie classification as a R2 institution and recognition for total research and development (R&D) expenditures; and high degree production in STEM, agriculture and health-related disciplines, areas in which minorities are historically underrepresented. Opportunities: FAMU's many opportunities include: a) an amplified focus on student success (including increasing retention/graduation rates and licensure pass rates); b) increased engagement in land-grant initiatives; c) increasing productivity in research; d) improving on key performance indicators; and e) growing upper-division enrollment through increased retention of current students and strategic initiatives such as specialized 2+2 articulation agreements. FAMU will also enhance its existing signature academic programs, such as pharmacy, business, architecture, law, nursing, music and STEM, while identifying new and emerging areas for growth, such as cybersecurity and data science, in which FAMU can be a national leader, particularly among HBCUs. FAMU will build upon its existing research strengths in agriculture, engineering, environmental science and the biomedical sciences, while identifying new areas of cutting-edge research in which the University can achieve distinction. Challenges: FAMU is continuing in its efforts to ensure student success by increasing retention and graduation rates at all degree levels; and improve performance on licensure exams. There also continues to be a critical need to upgrade and expand campus facilities, particularly with respect to student housing, student services and faculty research spaces. Additionally, due to the financial circumstances of many of our students, access to need-based aid continues to be a challenge."}, {"section_title": "Increase student success.", "text": "The University will continue and enhance ongoing efforts to increase student success, with an emphasis on: 1) increasing student retention, persistence and graduation rates; 2) increasing passage rates on licensure exams; 3) increasing enrollment of AA transfers; 4) increasing the availability of student internship opportunities and professional development activities that enhance student preparation for employment in high-demand fields; 5) increasing the number of graduates in programs of strategic emphasis; and 6) increasing the availability of courses for current students by offering additional sections via the online modality. As the University implements its new 2017-2022 strategic plan (FAMU Rising), specific efforts to increase retention and four-year graduation rates for FTIC students will include implementation of the following initiatives: Restructuring Academic Advisement The University will make significant investments to improve academic advisement by hiring up to 25 new full-time professional advisors in the coming year. These new hires will allow the University to increase the use of proven best practices, such as intrusive advising and academic coaching. The University also plans to completely overhaul its current advisement structure, which includes placing the unit under the Office of Enrollment Management.
