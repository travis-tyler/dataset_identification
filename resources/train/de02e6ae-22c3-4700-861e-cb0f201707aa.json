Like it, predecessors, it presents trends in doctorate production in the United States, describing the broad fields in which Ph.D.s are earned and the general demographic characteristics of doctorate recipients. However, Summary Report 1992 differs noticeably in format from its most recent predecessors. The report has been redesigned to facilitate the use of the data by university, state, and federal leaders who develop policies affecting graduate education throughout the United States. The front section presents selected trend data in figures accompanied by a brief narrative describing key findings. Data tables, which furnish the numbers corresponding to the percentages found in the figures, are located in the section directly following the figures. This section also includes tables which have no corresponding figure, but which present related data in finer detail than is possible in figures (relevant tables are referenced at the bottom of the figures). Another change to Summary Report 1992 is the separation of the special analysis section from the report. A special analysis, in the form of a data brief, will appear in the fall. As usual, supplementary tables on the most recent year's doctorates-1992 in this caseare displayed in Appendix A of this report, and 1982-1992 data are presented in Appendix B. Technical notes are in Appendix C, and the survey questionnaire is included in Appendix D. Seven broad fields are profiled in the text of Summary Reports. Readers should note that these fields may differ from those reported by federal sponsors of the survey. \"Major\" fiel 's are the subfields that make up the broad fields (e.g., biological sciences as a part of life sciences or psychology as a part of social sciences). For a list of these subfields, see the inside back cover of this report and the specialties list in Appendix D. The estimates reported for the Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED) are simple tabulations of all available information, with no adjustment for nonresponse. Thus, differences in response rates from year to year can produce numencal fluctuations which are unrelated to true trends. The numbers presented in this report may be underestimated, depending on the variables displayed. The SED has always enjoyed an unusually high response, but in 1981 it began to drop, falling from a high of 96.2 in 1980 to a low of 92.3 in 1989. The decline in self-report response rates evident throughout the 1980s was reversed in 1990, however, and has increased each year since to its current level of 95.0 percent. (Note: These rates represent the proportion of questionnaires completed by the doctorate recipients and thus are self-report rates. Forms completed by either the doctoral institution or NRC staff ale not included in these self-report rates but are included in all tabulations in this report. The self-report rate for 1992 may increase somewhat in the next year if additional questionnaires are received from doctorate recipients. See page 76 in Appendix C for a table showing survey response rates from 1980 to 1992.) Item response rates have shown a parallel improvementboth a natural consequence of the increase in the overall self-report rate and a result of format revisions to the questionnaire and follow-ups for missing information.

Thus, differences in response rates from year to year can produce numerical fluctuations which are unrelated to true trends. The numbers presented in this report may be underestimated, depending on the variables displayed. The SED has always enjoyed an unusually high response, but in 1981 it began to drop, falling from a high of 96.2 in 1980 to a low of 92.3 in 1989. The decline in self-report response rates evident throughout the 1980s was reversed in 1990, however, and has increased each year since to its current level of 95.0 percent.

Item response rates have shown a parallel improvementboth a natural consequence of the increase in the overall self-report rate and a result of format revisions to the questionnaire and follow-ups for missing information. In 1990, new follow-up procedures were implemented, increasing coverage of several variables (birth year, gender, race/ethnicity, citizenship status, country of citizenship, BA institution, y! ar of BA, and postgraduation plans). These new procedures have substantially improver! response rates, particularly for race/ethnicity and citizenship, resulting in increase4 counts of minority Ph.D.s. The most significant adjustment was to the data on black Ph.D.s, whose numbers for the aggregate of citizenship groups increased by 7.5 pz.rcent in the year after survey closure. This was true for both the 1990 and 1991 surveys. Most follow-up responses, though, were not included in the initial reporting of survey results in Swnmary Report 19% and 1991 because they were not received until qfter closure of the surveys. Updated 1990 numbers reflecting additional data were displayed in Summary Report 1991, and updated 1991 numbers are shown in Appendix Table B2 (page 72) in this year's report. The data for 1992 will likewise be subject to further revision, and adjustmcnts will be presented in next year's report. However, the 1992 survey cycle was extended one month to allow receipt of more follow-up information before closure, and it is anticipated that adjustments will be minimal compared to those in 1990 and 1991.

The subfields correspond to the fields on the questionnaire's Specialties List located at the back of this report. Field groupings may differ from those in reports published by federal sponsors of the Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED). See inside the back cover for a description of field groupings as reported in these tables. The \"general\" field categoriese.g., \"chemistry, general\"include individuals who either received the doctorate in the general subject area or did not indicate a particular specialty field. The \"other\" field categoriese.g., \"chemistry, other\"include individuals whose specified doctoral discipline was not among the specialty fields. Table A-1 presents data by drictoral specialty and gender.  Percentage with Master's: The percentage of doctorate recipients in a field who received a master's degree in any field before earning the doctorate. Median Time Lapse: \"Total Time\" refers to total calendar time elapsed between the year of baccalaureate and the year of doctorate; \"Registered Time\" refers to the total time registered in a university between baccalaureate and doctorate. Enrollment includes years of attendance not related to a recipient's doctoral program. Months are excluded from the computations because they are rarely reported. Postgraduation Plans: Each year's doctorate recipients provide information on postgraduation employment or study plans in response to items 20-24 on the survey form. Since the questionnaire is filled out around the time the doctorate is awarded, a recipient's plans are subject to change. However, comparisons with the longitudinal Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR) have shown SED data to be a reasonable indicator of actual employment status in the year following the doctorate. (The SUR, also conducted by the National Research Council, is a follow-up employment survey of a sample of doctorate recipients in scieice, engineering, and humanities fields.) For a comparison of the immediate postgraduation plans of Ph.D.s in the 1990 SED with their employment status in the 1991 SDR, see the table below; refer to the footnote on page 84 in Appendix C for additional information on those Ph.D.s who reported definite commitments at the time they completed the SED questionnaire. COMPARISON  * This comparison may underestimate postdoctoral study because it is likely that some Ph.D.s who reported plans for postdoctoral study in the SED had completed their postdoctoral appointments by the time the 1991 SDR was distributed. There is a gap of 1-2 years between the Ph.D. graduation dates in the SED and the reference date for employment in the 1991 SDR. In Table A-3, the postgraduation plans of doctorate recipients are grouped as follows: \"Postdoctoral Study Plans\" (fellowship, research associateship, traineeship, other), \"Planned Employment\" (educational institution, industry, etc.), or \"Postdoctoral Plans Unknown.\" These categories include recipients who were still negotiating or seeking positions at the time of survey completion, as well as those whose plans were definite. The sum of these lines equals 100 percent for each column, with allowance for rounding: for example, 55.7 percent of all chemists had postdoctoral study plans, 37.7 percent planned to be employed, and 6.6 percent did not report their postgraduation plans, totaling 100 percent. The study and employment rows are further subdivided. The data on study plans show that 25.6 percent of all chemists planned to pursue postdoctoral fellowships; 28.4 percent, research associateships; 0.7 percent, traineeships; and 1.0 percent, some other form of postdoctoral study. These percentages sum to 55.7 percent, the proportion of chemists who reported plans for postdoctoral study. The employment row is similarly subdivided by type of employer. The percentages for these rows add to 37.7 percentthe proportion of chemistry Ph.D.s who planned employment. The category for educational institutions includes elementary and secondary schools as well as colleges and universities, and the category for government includes military service. The four lines of data beginning with \"Definite Postdoctoral Study\" distinguish between individuals who had definite postgraduaC:on plans at the time of survey completion (item 20: \"Am returning to, or continuing in, predoctoral employment\" or \"Have signed contract or made definite commitment\") and those who were still seeking employment or postdoctoral study (item 20: \"Am negotiating with one or more specific organizations,\" \"Am seeking position but have no specific prospects,\" or \"Other\"). These four lines, when added to the prior line, \"Postdoctoral Plans Unknown,\" total 100 percent with allowance for rounding. The two lines \"Definite Postdoctoral Study\" and \"Seeking Postdoctoral Study\" add to give the percentage for \"Postdoctoral Study Plans\"; the two lines \"Definite Employment\" and \"Seeking Employment\" add to give the percentage for \"Planned Employment After Doctorate.\" Percentages showing the distribution of doctorate recipients by postdoctoral work activity and region of employment are based only on the number of recipients who had definite employment commitments at the time they completed the questionnaire. These percentages exclude recipients who planned postdoctoral study (as described above) and recipients who were still seeking employment at the time they completed the questionnaire. (Note that the rows on specific postdoctoral study and employment plans discussed earlier include individuals whose plans were not definite). Revisions to the questionnaire format appear to have resulted in higher rates of nonresponse to the item on work activity in recent years. Nonresponse was 14.0 percent in 1990, 13.9 percent in 1991, and 14.6 percent in 1992, compared to only 6.2 percent in 1989. The U.S. regions of employment shown in Table A-3 include the following states and territories: TABLE A-4: Table A-4 contains data by race/ethnicity and citizenship for selected variables included in Tables A-3 and A-5. Field groupings may differ from those in reports published by federal sponsors of the SED. See inside the back cover for a description of field groupings as reported in these tables; refer to the questionnaire's Specialties List at the back of the report for the names and codes of the subfields included. See the notice on page 35 for important information on recent increases in response rates and their impact on time-series data. The racial/ethnic question has undergone several revisions over the years. In 1977, it was modified to correspond to a standard question format recemmended by the Federal Interagency Committee on Education and adopted by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for use in federally sponsored surveys; an explanation of the effect of these changes is detailed on page 13 of Summary Report 1977. (Note: Changes in the OMB guidelines prompted the moving of persons having origins in the Indian subcontinent from the white category to the Asian category.) In 1980, the item was further revised in two ways: (1) the Hispanic category was subdivided into Puerto Rican, Mexican American, and \"other\" Hispanic to provide more detail for users of the racial/ethnic data, and (2) respondents were asked to check only one racial category. (Before 1980, doctorate recipients could check more than one category to indicate their race. When the data were compiled, however, all persons who checked American Indian, Asian, or Hispanic and also checked white were included in the minority group category. Those who checked black and any other category were designated as black.) The item was modified again in 1982 to separate the questions on race and ethnicity. Since then, respondents have been asked to first check one of the four racial group categories (American Indian, Asian, black, or white) and then to indicate whether or not they are Hispanic. In Table A-4, Ph.D.s who reported Hispanic heritage, regardless of racial designation, are included in one of three Hispanic groups: Puerto Rican, Mexican American, or Other Hispanic. The remaining survey respondents are then counted in the respective racial groups. (Note: Doctorate recipients who checked the category \"American Indian or Alaskan Native\" are identified as Native American in this report.) In the section on \"Graduate School Support,\" a recipient counts in more than one category if support was received from multiple sources. Because a student counts once for each of his/her sources of support, the vertical percentages sum to more than 100 percent. See the explanatory note on Appendix Table A-5 for further detail. (Data on the primary source of support for doctorate recipients are presented in the body of the report.) The other sections of Table A-4 correspond to many of those in Appendix Table   A-3. The reader is referred to the explanatory note on For the last three years, federal research assistantships (RAs) have been aggregated with university RAs and shown -Inder \"University\" in this table. The RA data were combined because focus groups of doctoral candidates have indicated uncertainty as to the source of their RA funding, and it is probable that some RAs have been reported incorrectly as university rather than federal. The reader should note that because percentages for university support appear higher and federal support lower in tables where RAs are aggregated, it is inadvisable to compare results from the 1990-1992 surveys with those from earlier years. The data in Table A-5 should be interpreted as follows: 136 male doctorate recipients in the physical sciences in 1992 reported financial support from federal fellowships or traineeships during graduate school. This number is 2.8 percent of the male physical sciences doctorates who answered the question and 12.2 percent of the males in all fields who reported federal fellowship or traineeship support.

For the remaining 5.0 percent of recipients, \"skeletal\" survey forms were created using information from doctorate-granting institutions or commencement programs. Whether or not individuals completed the survey questionnaire, the following four data items are available for all recipients: gender, Ph.D. institution, Ph.D. field, and Ph.D. year. This report presents data obtained from all survey forms, both \"self-reported\" and \"skeletal.\" Nonresponse in a tabulation varies according to the combination of selected variables. Higher nonresponse rates occur when any of the four above-mentioned variables are crossed with another variable (e.g., debt level) because the universe of this cross-tabulation comprises the entire doctoral cohort. This means that the 5.0 percent of Ph.D.s who did not respond to the survey are included, even though their records contain minimal information. Nonresponse is general'y lower when citizenship or race/ethnicity is cross-tabulated with a variable such as debt level because the population is restricted to a group (e.g., U.S. citizens) which is largely drawn from self-reported forms and, therefore, more likely to include responses to debt level. To be more precise, the nonresponse rate for debt level in 1992 was 3.0 percent for U.S. citizens, 4.4 percent for permanent residents, and 6.2 percent for temporary residents; nonresponse was low because information on both citizenship and debt is obtained mostly from self-reported forms. Nonresponse was higher when debt level was crossed with gender (7.2 percent for men and 6.2 percent for women) because gender is one of the data items available for all recipients; thus, the population in this cross-tabulation included the 5.0 percent of Ph.D.s who were not self-reporting and for whom there is minimal information. Howevet , there is less variation in nonresponse rates for 1992 data than for earlier r.ars because the survey cycle was extended to permit receipt of more follow-up information before closure. To illustrate, we will continue with the example on \"debt level\" used above. Because gender information is available for all Ph.D.s while citizenship and debt level are usually obtained from self-reporting forms, one would expect the ra..e of nonresponse to the question on debt level to be higher for women than for temporary residents. Yet in 1992, nonresponse to debt level was the same for both women and temporary residents (6.2 percent). This occurred because citizenship is one of the variables which is followed up if missing from the survey form, while information on de'ut level is not further solicited. In this case, follow-up responses were received before survey closure, identifying some recipients as temporary residents. The citizenship status of these individuals was then updated to reflect the follow-up responses, but debt level remained unknown if not originally reported. For the most part, the tables and figures in this report display percentages that are based only on the number of doctorate recipients who responded to the applicable survey questions; recipients who did not respond are excluded.' The technical notes in this 'Appendix Tables A-3 and A-4 are exceptions. Because these tables include categories for \"unknown\" responses, percentages are based on the total doctoral cohort."}, {"section_title": "0", "text": "Figures 2 anci 6, Tables 3 and 4 (citizenship) Figure 3 (race/ethnicity) Figure 7, Tables 6 and 7 (time-to-doctorate) Figure 8, Table 8 (primary source of graduate school support) Figure 9, Tables 9 and 10 (cumulative debt level) Figures 10-12 * The nonresponse rate for this item is less than the overall nonresponse rate of 5.0 percent because institutions are asked to provide this information for doctorate recipients who either did not complete a survey form or did not respond to the survey question.

A historical discussion of the racial/ethnic question and important infonnattan on recent adjustments to racial/ethnic data are presented below and on the next page. Although the item on race/ethnicity was first introduced to the Survey of Earned Doctorates in 1973, over 25 p-:cent of recipients in 1973 and about 13 percent in 1974 either completed earlier questionnaires or provided unusable responses. Since 1975, the racial/ethnic data have been more reliable, with response rates ranging between 91 and 96 percent. The information on race/ethnicity presented in this report is limited to the period 1977 to 1992. The racial/ethnic question has undergone several revisions over the years. In 1977, it was mod fied to correspond to a standard question format recommended by the Federal Interagency Committee on Education and adopted by the Office of Management and Budget (0M3) for use in federally sponsored surveys; an explanation of the effect of these changes is detailed on page 13 of Summary Report 1977. (Note. Changes in the OMB guidelines prompted the reclassification of persons having origins in the Indian Appendix C 2. Figure 3 (continued) 81 subcontinent from the white category to the Asian category.) In 1980, the question was further revised in two ways: (1) the Hispanic category was subdivided into Puerto Rican, Mexican American, and \"other\" Hispanic to provide more detail for users of the racial/ethnic data, and (2) respondents were asked to check only one racial category. (Before 1980, doctorate recipients could check more than one category to indicate their race. When the data were compiled, however, all persons who checked American Indian, Asian, or Hispanic and also checked white were included in the minority group category. Those who checked black and any other category were designated as black.) The item was modified again in 1982 to separate the questions on race and ethnicity. Since then, respondents have been asked to first check one of the four racial group categories (American Indian, Asian, black, or white) and then indicate whether or not they are Hispanic. In this report, Ph.D.s who reporteci Hispanic heritage are classified as \"Hispanic\" regardless of their racial designations; the remaining Ph.D.s are then counted in the racial group they reported. Recipients who checked the category \"American Indian or Alaskan Native\" are identified as \"Native American,\" and Ph.D.s from 1977 to 1979 who indicated that they were both white and a minority are included with the minority group. *** ADJUSTMENTS TO RACIAL/ETHNIC DATA *** Readers should note that because of recent increases in survey response, the racial/ethnic data for 1990-1992 may overstate any increases for these variables during this time period. In 1990, new follow-up procedures were implemented, increasing coverage of several variables and resulting in greater adjustment of data after survey closure than was the case in earlier years. These new procedures had an especially strong impact on citizenship and racial/ethnic data. The most significant adjustment was among black Ph.D.s, whose numbers for the aggregate of citizenship groups increased by 7.5 percent in the year after survey closure. This was true for both the 1990 and 1991 surveys. Updated numbers for both years are included in Appendix Table B-2 in this report. Adjustments to the 1992 data will appear in next year's report. See the notice on page 75 for additional information. 6. Figures 10-12 (pages 15-17) and Tables 11-16 (pages 27-32): The question on postgraduation status asks recipients to indicate whether they have made a \"definite\" commitment, are in the process of \"negotiating\" with one or more organizations, or are seeking a position but with no prospects. Because Ph.D.s sometimes complete the survey form months ahead of graduation, it is not possible to determine the final plans of many recipients. It is quite likely, however, that some individuals who check \"negotiating\" or \"seeking\" have obtained positions by the time of graduation. Because many outcomes are unknown, data on postgraduation plans in this report are restricted to the group of Ph.D.s who reported \"definite\" plans.' See pages 85-86 for rates of nonresponse to the question on postgraduation status and for the proportions of Ph.D.s with \"definite\" plans. 2 Comparisons with the most recent longitudinal Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR) have shown the data on \"definite\" postgraduation plans to be a reasonable indicator of the actual employment status of new Ph.D.s in the year following receipt of the doctorate. (The SDR, also conducted by the National Research Council, is a follow-up employment survey of a sample of doctorate recipients in science, engineering, and humanities fields.) According to the 1991 SDR, 9-percent of the 1990 Ph.D.s who had indicated \"definite\" employment plans at the time of graduation were in the U.S. labor force as of September 1991 (1-2 years after graduation), and most were working in the sector reported on their survey forms. Disaggregation by citizenship revealed that all permanent residents and 95.3 percent of temporary residents in the sample were employed in the United States in September 1991.
