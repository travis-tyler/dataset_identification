[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "There is a strong interest in acquiring a better understanding of what influences interest in science since it is supposed to be related to pupils' future scientific skills and studies. The aim of this study is to examine, for the Italian Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2007 data, the relationship between contextual factors, at school level and at pupil level, and the students' interest in science. A multilevel analysis is conducted considering the home/student level nested under the school/teacher level.

The analysis of the aspects related to interest in science from the earliest years in school is particularly valuable in order to discover the possible factors motivating young people to embark on scientific studies. The Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS; Martin, Mullis, Foy, 2008) concerning fourth grade pupils offers a precious opportunity to investigate this issue. TIMSS 2007 collected, along with data on pupils' science performance, also information regarding a series of student, teacher and school variables. Fostering positive interest toward science is often an important goal of a science curriculum and TIMMS 2007 developed the Index of Students' Positive Affect Toward Science (Olson, Martin, Mullis, 2008) to summarizes information about students' self-reported pleasure in studying science. Italian results from TIMSS 2007 showed that fourth grade students generally had a positive attitude toward science, with 77 percent of students at the high level of the index, 12 percent at the medium level and 11 percent at the low level. Unfortunately, TIMMS 20007 results did not clarify which factors, at different levels, were related to student's scientific interest in the Italian context. According to TIMSS 2007 assessment framework (Mullis, Martin, Ruddock, O'Sullivan, Arora, Eberber, 2005) , the structure of these factors should be a multilevel and a multidimensional one."}, {"section_title": "Purpose of the study", "text": "The aim of this study is to examine, for the Italian Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2007 data, the relationship between contextual factors at the school level and at the pupil level and the"}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants and procedures", "text": "Data is based on the answers of 4470 pupils in Grade 4 (48.7% girls and 51.3% boys), as well as those of the teachers and principals of the 170 schools which took part in the TIMSS 2007 study in Italy. The data was collected in the classes during the second periods of an ordinary school day."}, {"section_title": "Variables", "text": "Measurements were taken at home/student level and at school/teacher level.

The independent variables were the TIMSS international indices and variables which were supposed (Mullis et al., 2005) to be theoretically related to interest in science. TIMSS international indices (Olson et al., 2008) are based on questionnaire responses from students, teachers and principals. Only indices with an acceptable reliability in terms of internal consistency in the Italian context (Cronbach's alpha above .60) were taken into consideration for the analysis.\nThe independent variables at the school and teacher level were: Index of teacher reports on teaching science classes with few or no limitations. The index was based on perceptions about the instructional impact of some characteristics of their students (e.g. differing academic abilities, students with special needs, disruptive students). The Cronbach's alpha of the index in the Italian context was 0.64.\nThe index was based on t their school in terms of an environment supportive of learning (e.g. t ion, parental support for student achievement, regard for school property). The Cronbach's alpha of the index in the Italian context was 0.85.\nThe index was based on t aspects of the school environment that impact their working conditions and capacity to provide effective science instruction. The Cronbach's alpha of the index in the Italian context was 0.62. The independent variables at the student level were:\nGender (scored 1/0). Students reports about homes literacy resources (number of books at home).\n-confidence in learning science.

A model with no explanatory variables (intercept-only model) was analyzed to estimate the school intra-class correlation. 2. The posited model was analyzed with all the variables taken into consideration in the present study."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "The intra-class correlation for the model was .03, meaning that only 3% of the variance of the scores for interest in science is attributable to school traits. Table 1 shows the results of the tested model. -Confidence in Learning were not significantly related to interest in science."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "This study was based on Italian data from TIMSS 2007 study and examined the relationship between contextual factors at the school level and at the multilevel regression modeling taking into account a set of variables, both at school and student levels.\nResults at the student level showed that the only variable which was significantly related with student interest was s self-confidence in learning science. This result is consistent with the prediction from selfdetermination theory (SDT; -determination, an innate necessity connected to a number of basic psychological needs such as the need for autonomy and the need for competence. The need for autonomy refers to the need for individuals to perceive that their behaviour originates from personal choices. In other words, the person who implements a certain way of behaving needs to perceive an internal locus of causality (Deci, 1980) . The need for competence refers to the human need to interact effectively avoiding changes that are seen as harmful (Deci & Ryan 1985) . According to SDT a high level of self-confidence should increase the level of perceived autonomy, which, in turn should increase the degree of interest.\n-Confidence in Learning was the only student level variable, which was significantly related to student interest. Searching for other variables at this level, positive interest in science, one should take into consideration that research has shown that a parental modality which is supportive of autonomy as opposed to a controlling modality influences the motivation of pupils (Deci & Ryan, 1991) . Parents whom external observers evaluated as being supportive of autonomy and more emotionally involved tended to have children who were more intrinsically motivated (Grolnick & Ryan, 1989) . Within the family the support of parents for autonomy is connected to their empathy, to being able to see things from the point of view of their children, to providing them with a choice on every occasion where this is possible, and to helping them to explore the world and to behave according to their own values and interests (Ryan, 1995) . Unfortunately TIMSS 2007 instruments did not include a questionnaire for parents so, for the present study there was not the possibility to analyse a measure of parents support for autonomy.\nAs regard the school level, the results showed that only the 3% of the variance for interest in science was related to schools features and practices. Furthermore, none of the school level variables taken into consideration had a significan Future studies and analyses will hopefully search for school level variables that can explain important differences between schools for interest in science. A possible direction could be to include, as a national option in TIMSS studies, a measure of teachers autonomy controlling behavior. As a matter of fact, several studies (e.g., Reeve, 2002; Assor, Kaplan, Kanat-Maymon, Roth, 2005) within a school context have behaviors such as giving rigid directives, closely supervising and monitoring, or not allowing students the opportunity to express choices and opinions that differ from those proposed by an adult, compared to the positive effects of behaviors that support the autonomy of students such as providing possibilities of choice, listening and asking students for their points of view."}]
