[{"section_title": "", "text": "rock minerals. However, the impact of the current geological-geochemical perturbations and the weakening geomagnetic field intensity on the COVID-19 pandemic has not been explored.\nHumans and constituent chiral biomolecules are forms of condensed matter [56, 57] ; however current theories and frameworks in the biological sciences are predominately governed by classical electrostatics (the electron's charge is the sole determinant of biochemical reactions) [58] ; therefore, perturbations in the spin state of electrons in chiral biomolecules are assumed to be unimportant, and relevant concepts in condensed matter physics are ignored. The discovery of the chiral-induced spin selectivity effect in chiral biomolecules suggests that an external magnetic field could alter the spin state of electrons in chiral biomolecules and result in the magnetic catalysis of aberrant molecules and pathology in humans and other animals; however, the role of magnetic catalysis in a pandemic has not been explored [59] [60] [61] . Indeed, Naaman et al. recently demonstrated that chiral biomolecules-ferromagnetic interfaces mediate spin polarization-induced enantioselective crystallization of biomolecules [61, 62] .\nThese developments highlight the need for an interdisciplinary analysis of the \"unseen nefarious force-induced disease\" hypothesis, posited by Neolithic-Traditional Chinese Medicine [26, 31, 32] and other Indigenous Knowledge [27] , which takes into consideration the associated epidemics and pandemics [74] . The germ theory was introduced in the late 19 th century and subsequently displaced most Indigenous knowledge systems [28] [29] [30] . Although the germ theory is the current dominant paradigm and exhibits an explanatory and predictive capacity for many features of the phenomenology of virus-associated epidemics and pandemics, many significant features are unaccounted for in this theory. Many respiratory virus-associated outbreaks (i.e., influenza outbreaks) exhibit a spatiotemporal dynamic that is couple to seasonal dynamics and associated geographic restrictions, despite increased intraregional and global travel in the 21 st century [75] [76] [77] [78] [79] . Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic mimics a vibrating drumhead-like oscillation across the globe, in contrast to the predicted nearsimultaneous severe global outbreaks posited by the germ theory [80, 81] . Importantly, the phenomenology of the SARS-CoV-2-associated COVID-19 pandemic has contradicted the germ theory-derived prediction that the severity of the outbreaks (based on deaths per million people) would be relatively higher in regions with relatively weak public health systems (i.e., Africa), as compared to regions with relatively strong health systems (i.e., North America and Western Eurasia) [81] . This discordancy cannot be reconciled globally by risk factors (i.e., elderly population) associated with COVID-19-induced mortality, ancestral differences (or the so-called genetic differences), molecular diagnostics capacity, or climate differences [82] .\nIndeed, Mbow M et al., 2020 showed analysis that incorporates age demographics, surveillance of acute health emergencies, and the number of tests per confirm COVID-19 cases do not account for the discordance between the germ theory-derived prediction and the actual outcome in regions with relatively strong health systems and those with weak health systems [82] . Furthermore, Japan, which lies outside Western Eurasia, has the highest percentage of the elderly population; however, Japan has not experienced a severe J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof outbreak [83] . Indeed, this anomaly within the germ theory occurred in Japan despite receiving a large percentage of the travelers from the Yangtze River basin (including Wuhan) at the onset of the pandemic and implementing limited social distancing interventions [80, 83] . This anomaly within the germ theory paradigm for the COVID-19 outbreaks in Japan is currently ascribed to the so-called \"unknown Japanese X factor\" [84] . Additionally, countries on the South American plate with relatively young populations (i.e., Peru, Ecuador) have experienced severe COVID-19 outbreaks [85] [86] [87] . Although regions with weak health systems have a relatively lower molecular diagnostic capacity, syndromic surveillance is employed globally [88] [89] [90] [91] [92] ; thus, deaths due to an emerging, severe acute respiratory disease is captured uniformly across time and different countries, irrespective of national wealth [82] . Tropical (warmer) climate per se does not affect the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic [93, 94] . Although tropical countries on the African, Indian, and Eurasian plates have experienced relatively less severe COVID-19 outbreaks, tropical countries on the South American plate have experienced severe COVID-19 outbreaks [94] . Populations with African ancestry have the highest COVID-19-mortality burden in North America [95, 96] and parts of Western Eurasia [97] , albeit, Africans have the lowest COVID-19-mortality burden [82] ; thus creating the African ancestry-COVID-19 paradox.\nA major unanswered question in the germ theory of virus-associated pandemics, including the SARS-CoV-2-associated COVID-19 pandemic, is the origin of the so-called emerging viruses.\nThe germ theory-derived hypothesis posits that emerging virus-associated pandemics result from a spill-over of viruses from wildlife into humans (the zoonosis hypothesis), with the seasonal-associated dynamics of the so-called spill-over events due to the seasonality of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f human activities in wildlife habitat. However, the recent discovery of the genetic fragments of many non-retroviruses, including the so-called emerging viruses, in the genomes of humans and many terrestrial animals raises concerns about the validity of that hypothesis [98] [99] [100] .\nSeasonal dynamics are a manifestation of geophysical dynamics, and those geophysical forces are manifested differently at various locations; thus, suggesting that geophysical forces could mediate the virus-associated pandemics.\nHere, using insights from Traditional Chinese Medicine and other Indigenous Knowledge, we evaluate the hypothesis, which posits, SARS-CoV-2-associated COVID-19 outbreaks are mediated by serpentinization-induced resonant long-wavelength magnetic anomalies (LWMAs) in tectonic plates with Proterozoic cratons and weakened geomagnetic field intensity. We proposed that those resonant LWMAs induce the magnetic catalysis of iron oxides-silicate-like minerals (i.e., iron oxides, hyaline) from biogenic molecules and SARS-CoV-2 from endogenous viral elements in the genome, resulting in morbidity and mortality. The resultant SARS-CoV-2 particles are capable of replication within the host and transmission across hosts; however, SARS-CoV-2 infection per se does not induce morbidity or mortality in humans [101, 102] . Furthermore, we argue that the macrophage inflammatory response associated with COVID-19-morbidity and mortality is a foreign body-like reaction [103] [104] [105] to infection have a similar viral load [107] . Here, we investigated the presence of iron oxidessilicate-like minerals and SARS-CoV-2-like infection in the lungs and kidneys of laboratory rats, with an emerging severe acute respiratory disease and multiple thoracic organ pathology, in the absence of experimental induction, and compared those pathologies to COVID-19 pathologies. We compared the ferromagnetic-like iron stores in COVID-19 high-risk and lowrisk groups to determine the role of ferromagnetic-like iron-mediated magnetic catalysis in COVID-19-induced morbidity and mortality. Additionally, we investigated the relationship between the spatiotemporal dynamics of severe COVID-19 outbreaks, terrestrial water storage dynamics, and the lithospheric component of the geomagnetic field in tectonic plates with Proterozoic cratons to establish the role of serpentinization-induced LWMAs in mediating severe COVID-19 outbreaks. Furthermore, based on the predictions by Bility, M. T., 2019 [108] , which posited the emergence of a geomagnetic field-driven, multi-year, oscillatory, severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic in North America; we evaluated the clinical and temporal relationship between the vaping-associated severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic of 2019 and the COVID-19 epidemic of 2020 in North America."}, {"section_title": "The Rat colony.", "text": "Adult male and female immunodeficient Sprague Dawley rats (SRG rats), carrying mutations in the recombination activating gene 2 (RAG2) and interleukin-2 receptor subunit gamma (IL2R\uf067) were obtained from the vendor (Hera BioLabs, Lexington, KY) and bred at the University of Pittsburgh beginning in July 2018. The rats were housed under specific-pathogen-free conditions in microisolator cages (generally 2 per cage, with an occasional single housing), on stainless steel (an iron alloy) racks (Model Number J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f RS10147U40MVSPSHR-R, Allentown Caging Equipment Company, Allentown, NJ), fed irradiated chow and autoclaved water, and handled in a biosafety cabinet. The animals were housed in 12 hours light/12 hours dark cycle, (7 AM to 7 PM), with temperatures of 65-75\u00b0F (~18-23\u00b0C) with 40-60% humidity. At any given time, the colony was/is predominately composed of 70% adolescents and adults (>2 months, and up to 12 months old). The COVID-19-like disease outbreak study was performed retrospectively; the colony was neither designed to record COVID-19-like disease in the rats or investigate the effect of the geomagnetic field on the rats. Therefore, animals were sacrificed immediately upon recording the COVID-19-like disease to relieve suffering per the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) guidelines. The COVID-19-like disease was only recorded in adult rats (> 6 months old), and predominately affected one of two cage mates. We have not recorded any disease in neonatal and juveniles. Within the colony, some animals were used to construct humanized rats for unrelated studies. In those unrelated studies, de-identified human fetal tissues were obtained Human fetal tissues for   constructing humanized rodents were handled and processed under biosafety level 2 conditions. Male and female neonatal rodents were myoablated via gamma radiation using cesium-137 irradiator, with a dose of 500 rads. Myoablated male and female neonatal rats were transplanted with human CD34 + hematopoietic stem cells (via retroorbital injection of 0.2X10^6 cells) and followed on two weeks later with autologous fetal-thymus and liver in the renal capsule. Some rats were transplanted as adults with human CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells (via retroorbital injection of 0.2X10^6 cells) and autologous human skin. The proportion of severe COVID-19 diseased adult rats that were not irradiated and those that were irradiated and transplanted was comparable to their proportion in the colony. Therefore, the transplantation procedure does not appear to affect the susceptibility to severe COVID-19-like disease. We acknowledge that future studies should include a rigorous design to assess the impact of various factors, especially low-dose gamma radiation, as it is well-established that low dose radiation can have a hormesis effect on disease outcomes."}, {"section_title": "Gross and In situ analysis of tissues.", "text": "The gross analysis was performed using a camera, with animals either euthanized or anesthetized before photographing.

We propose that the serpentinization of peridotites in the terrestrial water storage and severely weakened geomagnetic field intensity [21, [112] [113] [114] .\nSpecifically, the production of ferromagnetic-like (ferrimagnetic) iron oxides-silicate rock minerals via serpentinization [21, 115] We recorded COVID-19-like symptoms (namely, labored/difficulty breathing and hemorrhaging-blood around nose) in laboratory rats via syndromic surveillance that included three times per day visual monitoring. (A) The values denote the total numbers of rats that developed COVID-19-like symptoms in a given month. (B) the values denote the total number of rats that developed COVID-19-like disease and the total number of rats that did not developed disease (healthy) for a given room location. The fisher's exact test P value = <0.0001. The result is significant at p < .05. Upon recording the COVID-19like disease, the rats were immediately sacrificed (per humane research guildelines) and the COVID-19-like pathologies in the thoracic organs were confirmed via necropsy. The rat colony was not designed beforehand to study COVID-19-like disease, and the syndromic surveillance procedures were instituted as a general welfare check to insure a healthy colony. The rats were housed at approximately equal ratio in two adjacent rooms. The total number of rats observed in the study period was ~ 92 and ~46 per sex. The COVID-19-like disease was recorded predominately in one room. Animals were handled by the same staff (in biosafety level 2 personal protective equipment). The rats were house in autoclaved microisolator cages on steel (iron alloy) racks, and always handled in a biosafety cabinet-Class 2, provided autoclaved bedding and water, and sterilized food.\nPrecambrian eon was associated with the Great Oxidation Event and orogenic activity that resulted in the formation of significant iron oxides-silicate rock minerals deposits in the lithosphere [118] [119] [120] . In support of this hypothesis, evidence in genomics demonstrates the presence of endogenous forms of human viruses, including the so-called emerging viruses, in Representative gross analysis of lung (green arrow), heart (yellow arrow) and kidney (blue arrow) in a healthy rat demonstrates the absence of lung, heart, and kidney pathology. (E) Representative gross analysis of lung (green arrow), heart (yellow arrow) and kidney (blue arrow) in a COVID-19-like diseased rat demonstrates the severe lung with hemorrhagic pathology, albeit the kidney and heart in this animal appear normal. Gross lung damage was recorded in 100% of the necropsy, while both gross lung and kidney damage was recorded in ~ 50% of the cases. Gross damage to the heart was recorded in a single animal. (F) Analysis of the blood (diluted at 1:1 using 20mM EDTA-anticoagulant) from a healthy rat demonstrates a lack of viscosity, with the blood flowing to the bottom of the tube after ~10 seconds following withdrawal. (G) On the contrary, analysis of the blood (also diluted at 1:1 using 20mM EDTA-anticoagulant) from a COVID-19-like diseased rat, demonstrates severe viscosity (viscous clot), with the blood unable to flow to the bottom of the tube after ~10 seconds, following withdrawal (G-Left panel) and ~10 minutes following storage at 4 degree Celsius in an inverted position (G-Middle panel); dilution of the blood at 1:10 using 20mM EDTA-anticoagulant further demonstrates that the blood immediately clots in less than 10 seconds, with the viscous clot lodged on the side of the tube (G-Right panel). Blood coagulation was recorded in ~50% of the COVID-19-like cases.\nJ o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f demonstrated that magnetic isotope and magnetic field effects modulate DNA synthesis [138] .\nThese developments suggest that interaction of chiral biomolecules (such as dsDNA of endogenous viruses, lipids, carbohydrates, and proteins) on ferromagnetic-like (superparamagnetic) minerals with resonant LWMAs could result in the magnetic catalysis of CoV-2 particles [60, 61, 139, 140] . Here, we proposed that serpentinization-induced resonant\nLWMAs interacts with ferromagnetic-like iron stores (i.e., ferrihydrite) in the host, and subsequently interacts with ferrous iron (Fe 2+ ) and dioxygen (O 2 ) in hemoglobin in red blood J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f cells, to catalyze ferric iron (Fe 3+ ) formation, and subsequently catalyze iron oxides formation via interaction with water molecules (H 2 O) in the blood, like during serpentinization [23, 115, 141] . This magnetic catalysis of iron oxides in red blood cells in COVID-19 results in a rapid depletion of bioavailable dioxygen (anoxic condition) and water molecules (dehydration) [115] .\nFurthermore, those iron oxides minerals (i.e., black particles) in the red blood cells are ferromagnetic-like (superparamagnetic); thus, the red blood cells form a gelatinous-like substance (viscous blood clots) [142] in the dehydrated blood in vessels, cavities, and tissues (i.e., lung, kidney) [143] . Here, we propose that serpentinization-induced resonant LWMAferromagnetic-like iron oxides (and iron oxyhydroxide) interactions also mediate the magnetic catalysis of ferromagnesian silicate-like minerals from biogenic molecules [23, 141, 144, 145] . (Figure 2) . The COVID-19-like disease in the rats occurred rapidly, with rats exhibiting excellent health status (normal movement, breathing, eating, and drinking) in J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f the prior evening, but incapable of breathing and hemorrhaging (and seizure in one case) by the next morning. Gross, histological, and immunohistochemistry analysis of the major organs in the COVID-19-like diseased rats demonstrate significant blood clotting, hardened tan gray/pale patches, and black-hemorrhagic patches in the lungs and kidneys, along with silicate/glass-like structures, and the presence of SARS-CoV-2-like antigens in the lung and kidney epithelium (Figure 3, 4, 5, 6) , which recapitulates COVID-19 pathology and the associated SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans [55, 142, [146] [147] [148] [149] [150] [151] [152] . The silicate/glass-like structures in the lungs and kidneys of the COVID-19-like diseased rats mimic the various stages associated with serpentinization-mediated rock-related mineralization (Figure 7 ) [115] .\nTissue iron analysis in the lung of a COVID-19-like diseased rat demonstrates the presence of ferric iron (Fe 3+) and iron oxides (golden brown/rust-like) particles coupled with the silicate/glass-like structures and patches with hemorrhagic infiltrates (Figure 7) . The silicate/glass-like structures and iron oxides deposits in the lungs and kidneys of the COVID-19-like diseased rat are consistent with tissue pathologies in COVID-19-induced mortality [50, 51] . Additionally, the ferromagnesian silicate-like minerals in the COVID-19-like diseased lung predominately emit red (denotes Fe 3+ in iron oxide), and green (denotes Fe 3+ in serpentine) fluorescence, with a composite whitish color, upon excitation with ultraviolet light, (Figure 8) , which is consistent with the fluorescent properties of serpentinization-induced minerals [153] .\norogenic belt [185] [186] [187] [188] [189] [190] ) and subsequently along the Appalachian-Ouachita orogenic belt on the North American plate and to the South American tectonic plate. Severe COVID-19 outbreaks predominately co-localize with the troughs of the lithospheric LWMAs [112] in tectonic plates with Proterozoic cratons, which are basin regions with population centers (Figure 10) . Severe outbreaks spread from the Yangtze River basin (Eastern Eurasia) to basins in Central Eurasia (Iran), Western Eurasia, the eastern portion of the North American plate, and subsequently to the basins on the South American plate [191] . The Greater Tethyan Eurasian orogenic belt has active serpentinization of peridotites and significant lithospheric LWMAs (Figure 10 ) [112, 185, 189, 192] . The Appalachian-Ouachita orogenic belt also has active serpentinization of peridotites and significant lithospheric LWMAs (Figure 10 ) [193] [194] [195] .\nThe pandemic also spread easterly, albeit less severe outbreaks in basins on the Korean Peninsula, the Island of Japan, and the western portion of the North America plate (Figure 10) .\nAmerica [205] . The vaping-associated severe acute respiratory syndrome disease exhibited symptomology, lung, and kidney diseases, with silicate/glass-like pathologies and iron oxidelike deposits (i.e., black particles), similar to COVID-19 [201] [202] [203] [204] 206] . Furthermore, the temporal dynamics of the vaping-associated severe acute respiratory syndrome disease outbreak (daily hospitalizations) in North America is similar to the temporal dynamics of COVID-19 outbreaks (daily deaths) in North America, with the epidemic emerging in the vernal equinoctial period, stabilizing during the solstitial period, increasing after the summer solstice, peaking around the autumnal equinox, and subsequently declining [202, 204] . Therefore, we J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f propose that the global epidemic curve of severe COVID-19 outbreaks (daily deaths over time) exhibit a semiannual oscillation, with two maxima in the equinoctial periods (late March-late April; late September-late October), and two minima around the solstices (late June-late July;\nlate December-late January) [200] , along with a quasi-biannual oscillation between years, in consistence with the geomagnetic field (and component lithospheric magnetic field) dynamics (Figure 12, 13 ) [207] [208] [209] . Furthermore, in consistence with the hypothesis that COVID-19 outbreaks are governed by geomagnetic field dynamics [210] , the global spatiotemporal dynamics of COVID-19 outbreaks mimics a vibrating drumhead-like dynamics. Although the Figure 13 : The spatiotemporal dynamics of severe COVID-19 outbreaks are associated with the oscillations of the geomagnetic field intensity and restricted to tectonic plates with Proterozoic cratons. The global temporal dynamics of severe COVID-19 outbreaks in the vernal phase is synchronous with the oscillations of the geomagnetic field intensity and predominately restricted to Eurasia and the Americas. Additionally, the global spatiotemporal dynamics of severe COVID-19 outbreaks mimics a vibrating drumhead, like the vibrating drumhead dynamics of the geomagnetic field intensity. The median time to death for COVID-19 in the vernal phase is ~3 weeks after the onset of illness; thus, there is a ~3 weeks backward shift in the peak at the equinox for the onset of illness associated with the peak daily death.\nJ o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f spatiotemporal dynamics and the intensity of the weakening geomagnetic field varies yearly, the previous patterns suggest relative oscillations between Western Eurasia (in the vernal phase) and the Americas (in the autumnal phase) [211] ; thus, we retrodict that the vernal phase of the epidemic coincided with the Western Eurasian mode and predict that the autumnal phase of the epidemic will coincide with the American mode. \nProterozoic cratons [186] . Here, we propose that precipitation (excess wetness)-associated increased in terrestrial water storage modulates the vernal equinoctial maximum of serpentinization-induced COVID-19-LWMAs, while evaporation (excess dryness)-associated decreased in terrestrial water storage modulates the autumnal equinoctial maximum of serpentinization-induced COVID-19-LWMAs [213] [214] [215] ; as demonstrated in the serpentinization-driven carbon dioxide mineralization in the Ronda peridotites (Western Eurasia) [186] . Analysis of the terrestrial water storage anomaly in tectonic plates with significant Proterozoic cratons in the vernal phase of the recorded COVID-19 pandemic (December 2019-May 2020) using GRACE Satellite Data Analysis Tool (National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA) [216] demonstrates that basins with severe COVID-19 outbreaks are associated with increased terrestrial water storage (wetter regions) and vice visa (Figure 14, 15, 16 ) [186] . We predict that basin regions with severe COVID-19 outbreaks in the autumnal phase will be spatiotemporally associated with decreased terrestrial water storage (excess dryness) and vice visa [186] ."}, {"section_title": "Abnormally high ferromagnetic-like iron stores (hyperferritinemia) in humans is the unifying determinant of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality", "text": "In the proposed hypothesis, ferromagnetic-like/superparamagnetic iron stores (i.e., ferrihydrite)\nin humans [154] is critical for resonant LWMA-mediated magnetic catalysis in COVID-19 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f pathologies. Iron stores are low in children and increases with age, with the highest levels in the elderly [155] [156] [157] [158] [159] . Males have significantly higher iron stores compared to females [160] .\nConsequently, COVID-19-induced morbidity and mortality risk are directly proportional to age J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f [161] [162] [163] , and male sex is also a significant risk factor for COVID-19-induced morbidity and mortality [161] .

The basins in Western Eurasia (Europe) also experience weakening geomagnetic field oscillations, with the strengthening field intensity in the Eurasian plate predominately occurring in Eastern Eurasia (Asia).

Therefore, stay-at-home restrictions, social distancing (>6 feet apart), and the use of facemasks are employed to control the pandemic [219, 220] . Furthermore, the global epidemic curve of SARS-CoV-2-associated COVID-19 outbreaks, with the maximum in the equinoctial period and the minimum in the solstitial period, is currently ascribed to those public health interventions. However, the germ theory and associated models have been incapable of making accurate long-term predictions about the spatiotemporal dynamics of COVID-19 outbreaks [218] . Furthermore, those germ theory-derived models cannot explain the differential severity of the COVID-19 pandemic within countries and continental regions or across tectonic plates without using ad-hoc immunizing hypotheses that cannot be falsified [218] . J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2020, The Atlantic; Coronavirus in South Africa: Scientists explore surprise theory for low death rate, by Andrew Harding, BBC) [82] . South Africa, which lies in the South Atlantic Anomaly and contains a Proterozoic range with active serpentinization-associated production of serpentine and iron oxides (the southern cape conductive belt) [221, 222] is the only country on the African plate with severe COVID-19 outbreaks [82] . Indeed, South Africa, with less than 5% of the population in Africa, accounts for approximately 50% of the COVID-19 deaths in Africa [223] . The severe COVID-19 outbreaks in South Africa compared to the rest of Africa cannot be ascribed to differences in ethnicity (so-called genetic differences), age demographics, health burdens, economic activities, molecular diagnostic capacity, or socialpolitical factors [82] . Botswana, which borders South Africa and lies at the edge of the South Atlantic Anomaly, has not experienced a severe COVID-19 outbreak, despite shared ethniccultural groups (predominately, Bantu tribes), similar age demographic (median age 24-27), underling health burdens (i.e., HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and obesity) and economic development/activities (i.e., mining and tourism) with South Africa [224] [225] [226] . Additionally, the disproportionate severity of COVID-19 outbreaks in South Africa emerged despite the early and stringent governmental interventions to enforce the germ theory-derived public health measures (i.e., social distancing, the wearing of facemasks) [82, 227] . Additionally, the divergent dynamics of COVID-19 outbreaks on the North American plate in the early autumnal phase, with increasing new COVID-19 deaths in the western portion (i.e., California) and decreasing new COVID-19 deaths in the northeastern portion (i.e., New York) has been ascribed to cultural-sociopolitical differences concerning the adherence to the germ theory- times as many coronavirus deaths as California, by German Lopez on April 13, 2020, Vox).\nWe argue that ascribing the divergent spatiotemporal dynamics of new COVID-19 deaths in Northeastern and Western North America (United States) to cultural-sociopolitical differences is an ad-hoc immunizing hypothesis. The northeastern (i.e., New York City) and western (i.e., Los Angeles) megacities of North America (United States) have similar populations (including a high level of human movement between those regions), social-political environments, and economic development/activities. Indeed, analysis of social distancing and masking adherence in western (i.e., California) and northeastern (New York) North America (United States) demonstrates similar levels (Supplementary Figure 1, 2, 3) . However, the northeastern (i.e., New York) and western (i.e., California) portions of North America (United States) exhibit divergent dynamics of terrestrial water storage, which we propose results in the divergent temporal dynamics of the severity of the COVID-19 outbreaks [228] [229] [230] . Terrestrial water storage dynamics also account for the disproportionate deaths in populations with African ancestry in the United States during the vernal phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Individuals with African ancestry disproportionally reside in basins within the coastal belt of the Greater Appalachian-Ouachita orogenic belt that spans the South to the Northeastern United States (the so-called Black belt) (Figure 17, 18) . This so-called Black belt region has been experiencing increased terrestrial water storage over the past decades [228] [229] [230] and experienced increased terrestrial water storage during the vernal phase of the COVID-19 pandemic (Figure 17, 18) . Indeed, a recent report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (Framing the Challenge of Urban Flooding in the United States, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2019) stated that individuals with African ancestry disproportionally reside in the low lying-flood prone areas in those coastal basins [231] . This geographic concentration of individuals with African ancestry in low lying-flood prone areas (de facto racial segregation) is due in part to the geographic locations of the historical-slave states, historical racial segregation laws and customs, and the continued economic disparity in the United States [232] . Thus, COVID-19 outbreaks disproportionally affected peoples with African ancestry in the United States during the vernal phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in part due to their geographic concentration in low lying-flood prone areas in the megacities within the coastal belt that spans the South to the Northeastern United States (the so-called Black belt). Indeed the disproportional COVID-19induced mortality in the African American population is directly associated with increased terrestrial water storage exposure in the vernal phase (Figure 17, 18) . Air pollution has been proposed within the germ theory paradigm as a co-determinant of COVID-19-induced mortality in the urban regions of North America (United States) and other parts of the world during the vernal phase of the pandemic [233, 234] . Thus, interventions against air pollution have been proposed as a means of directly reducing COVID-19-induced mortality [233, 234] . The assertion that air pollution accounts for the severity of COVID-19 outbreaks is contradicted by global-scale analysis, which shows that the tectonic plates with the highest COVID-19-mortality burden (the North American, South American, and Western Eurasian tectonic plates) have the lowest air population (Supplementary Figure 4) [235] . In contrast, continental regions with the lowest COVID-19-mortality burden (the African, Indian, and Eastern Eurasian tectonic plates) have the highest air population (Supplementary Figure 4) . Urban regions are the industrial regions (regions with air pollution generating-human activities [235] ) in most countries [236] [237] [238] [239] [240] [241] [242] [243] , and they are predominately located in river basins with relatively higher terrestrial water J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f storage [244] . Therefore, regional (i.e., county/province) analysis within a country will demonstrate a direct association between the severity of COVID-19 outbreaks and the air pollution during the vernal phase of the pandemic [236] , albeit, that association does not exist for continental (i.e., tectonic plates) analysis at the global scale (Supplementary Figure 4) . A temperate climate condition and reduced solar radiation have been proposed as a major determinant of severe COVID-19 outbreaks in North America (United States) and other regions [245] [246] [247] ; however, severe COVID-19 outbreaks occurred in divergent climate and solar radiation conditions (Supplementary Figure 5 ) [248] . The proposed serpentinization-induced lithospheric LWMAs mediated severe COVID-19 outbreaks hypothesis provides a means to predict the spatiotemporal dynamics of severe COVID-19 outbreaks using empirical data obtained from magnetometry and gravimetry satellites as demonstrated in Bility, M.T., 2019 [108] . Like current responses to natural disasters, the nowcasting and forecasting of COVID-19-LWMAs using those empirical data could enable better mitigation strategies. Additionally, the development of personal protective equipment/devices, such as Nephrite-Jade amulets [34] , which may readily interact with and abrogate serpentinization-induced LWMAs, may provide a means of shielding humans and preventing COVID-19. Furthermore, biomedical interventions targeting ferromagnetic-like iron stores (i.e., iron chelators-deferoxamine [176, 178, 179, 249] ) in high-risk groups or diseased individuals may provide a means of preventing and ameliorating COVID-19."}, {"section_title": "Strengths and limitations of the magnetic catalysis-mediated COVID-19 hypothesis", "text": "A limitation of this study is the lack of genomic sequence data for the coronavirus producing Netherlands) demonstrated that emerging SARS-CoV-2-like viruses in animals and humans within an isolated geographic location exhibit similarity in their genomic sequences, albeit differences exist [250] . Furthermore, that study demonstrates similar hemorrhagic lung disease as observed in our study, thus providing additional evidence that animal colonies are susceptible to outbreaks of lethal COVID-19-like disease and associated SARS-CoV-2-like infection in the absence of experimental induction [250] . A limitation of this study is that we did not examine vaping-associated severe acute respiratory syndrome disease tissues from 2019 for the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Another limitation of this study is the lack of data identifying the lithospheric magnetic field-spherical harmonics that mediate severe COVID-19\noutbreaks. Furthermore, this study did not identify the electromagnetic wave(s) that mediates COVID-19.\nFuture experiments and analysis in support of this hypothesis will determine 1) the genomic sequence of the polynucleotide molecules producing the SARS-CoV-2-like antigens in the laboratory rats using next-generation sequencing technology, 2) the ability of Nephrite-Jade amulets to prevent lethal COVID-19-like disease and associated SARS-CoV-2-like infection in laboratory rats in our colony during the equinoctial period, 3) the presence of SARS-CoV-2 genomes and antigens in the blood and tissues of vaping-associated severe acute respiratory syndrome patients in North America and collected in 2019 prior to the recorded COVID-19 pandemic using validated diagnostic assays, 4) the lithospheric magnetic field-spherical harmonics associated with the spatiotemporal dynamics of severe COVID-19 outbreaks using J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f magnetometry satellites data along with gravimetry satellites data (i.e. Swarm and GRACE-FO satellites) and epidemiological data (i.e., Our World in Data), and 5) the ability of an artificial magnetic field to generate of iron oxides-silicate-like minerals and SARS-CoV-2 via altering the spin state of electrons in biogenic molecules from humans (and other animals).\nIn this study, we proposed a hypothesis for the SARS-CoV-2-associated COVID-19 pandemic based on an approximately 7,000-6,000 years old knowledge system (Hemudu and Majiabang-Traditional Chinese Medicine) that emerged on the Proterozoic-Yangtze craton during severe geological and geophysical conditions that are similar to the current conditions of the Holocene [4, 14] . The scientific frameworks and concepts employed in the proposed hypothesis, namely, 1) the carbonate-silicate geochemical cycle and the associated generation of magnetic anomalies via serpentinization of peridotites in a weakened geomagnetic field [21] , 2) chiral-induced spin selectivity effect in biological molecules [61] , and 3) magnetic catalysis [125, 126, 251] are well-established. This work provides a hypothesis (including the mechanism of disease) along with supporting evidence for the role of serpentinization-induced resonant LWMAs in mediating the spatiotemporal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2-associated COVID-19 outbreaks. Most important, the proposed hypothesis meets the criteria of a robust scientific hypothesis [252] [253] [254] [255] ; namely, 1) it is grounded in well-established scientific frameworks and concepts, 2) provides a unifying and self-consistent framework that accounts for the empirical evidence, including the so-called anomalies and paradoxes within the current dominant paradigm (the germ theory), 3) makes falsifiable predictions (as demonstrated in Bility, M.T., 2019 [108] ) and retrodictions, which can be readily examined by others using empirical evidence, and 4) it does not employ logical fallacies that appeal to emotion (i.e., J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f sociopolitical-cultural affiliation) or authority (i.e., status within society). Additionally, this hypothesis addressed the well-established limitations of the germ theory in describing and predicting the phenomenology of the SARS-CoV-2-associated COVID-19 pandemic."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "In conclusion, for the first time, we provide a hypothesis, which posits that the carbonate- "}]
