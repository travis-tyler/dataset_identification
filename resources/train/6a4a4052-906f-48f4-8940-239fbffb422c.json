[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Accumulating evidence demonstrating higher cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1Syn) levels and \u03b1Syn pathology in the brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients suggests that \u03b1Syn is involved in the pathophysiology of AD. To investigate whether \u03b1Syn could be related to specific aspects of the pathophysiology present in both sporadic and familial disease, we quantified CSF levels of \u03b1Syn and assessed links to various disease parameters in a longitudinally followed cohort (n = 136) including patients with sporadic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD, and in a cross-sectional sample from the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer's Network (n = 142) including participants carrying autosomal dominant AD (ADAD) gene mutations and their non-mutation carrying family members. Our results show that sporadic MCI patients that developed AD over a period of two years exhibited higher baseline \u03b1Syn levels (p = 0.03), which inversely correlated to their Mini-Mental State Examination scores, compared to cognitively normal controls (p = 0.02). In the same patients, there was a dose-dependent positive association between CSF \u03b1Syn and the APOE\u03b54 allele. Further, CSF \u03b1Syn levels were higher in symptomatic ADAD mutation carriers versus non-mutation carriers (p = 0.03), and positively correlated to the estimated years from symptom onset (p = 0.05) across all mutation carriers. In asymptomatic (Clinical Dementia Rating < 0.5) PET amyloid-positive ADAD mutation carriers CSF \u03b1Syn was positively correlated to 11 C-Pittsburgh Compound-B (PiB) retention in several brain regions including the posterior cingulate, superior temporal and frontal cortical areas. Importantly, APOE\u03b54-positive ADAD mutation carriers exhibited an association between CSF \u03b1Syn levels and mean cortical PiB retention (p = 0.032). In both the sporadic AD and ADAD cohorts we found several associations predominantly between CSF levels of \u03b1Syn, tau and amyloid-\u03b2 1-40 . Our results suggest that higher CSF \u03b1Syn levels are linked to AD pathophysiology at the early stages of disease development and to the onset of cognitive symptoms in both sporadic and autosomal dominant AD. We conclude that APOE\u03b54 may promote the processes driven by \u03b1Syn, which in turn may reflect on molecular mechanisms linked to the asymptomatic build-up of amyloid plaque burden in brain regions involved in the early stages of AD development."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Intracellular neurofibrillary tau tangles and extracellular amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) plaques are the main neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD), however, at autopsy more than 50% of these patients exhibit concurrent \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1Syn) pathology [1, 16, 31] . Conversely, it has been shown that A\u03b2 plaques promote the development of cortical \u03b1Syn lesions in individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD), and up to 50% of PD with dementia patients develop A\u03b2 and tau pathology sufficient for a secondary pathological diagnosis of AD [19, 46] . \u03b1-synuclein, a 140 amino-acid protein encoded by the SNCA gene, is abundantly expressed neuronal presynaptic terminals [20] . The peptide corresponding to residues 61-95 of \u03b1Syn was originally discovered 25 years ago in A\u03b2 plaques and named the non-A\u03b2 component (NAC) [58] . Follow-up studies from the same group further demonstrated NAC immune-reactivity in diffuse A\u03b2 plaques which may result in the formation of mature compact A\u03b2 plaques [33] . Results from these studies suggest that \u03b1Syn might be involved in the development of AD from the very early stages of A\u03b2 pathology formation. In support, a recent study demonstrated a positive correlation between cerebrospinal fluid levels of \u03b1Syn and A\u03b2 plaque deposition in cognitively normal individuals with subjective memory complaints. The authors speculated that CSF \u03b1Syn levels may be related to pathophysiological mechanisms occurring early in the preclinical phase of AD [59] .\nThe relevance of correlating \u03b1Syn levels in the CSF to brain parenchymal concentration of \u03b1Syn in AD patients is nevertheless controversial due to the lack of autopsyvalidated studies assessing \u03b1Syn levels in paired CSF and brain tissue samples. Ideally, advancements in radiotracer chemistry could allow for ante-mortem imaging studies in which CSF \u03b1Syn concentrations could be correlated to \u03b1Syn load in the antemortem brain, similar to PiB-PET correlations between CSF A\u03b2 levels and brain amyloid plaque load [13] . Hence the exact relationship between the low CSF \u03b1Syn and brain parenchymal Lewy bodies as occurring in patients with synucleinopathies like PD [68] and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) [37] remains unknown. Similarly, the relevance of slightly increased CSF \u03b1Syn levels in AD patients [26] to \u03b1Syn pathology in the brain is also unclear.\nIn a study of brains from AD patients devoid of Lewy bodies, intracellular levels of soluble monomeric \u03b1Syn were two-fold higher than in controls and significantly correlated to cognitive decline [28] . Potential alterations of CSF \u03b1Syn levels in the same subjects were not investigated. Although \u03b1Syn can interact with a multitude of cellular components, of which many have been shown to potentially contribute to neurodegeneration [66] , the molecular underpinnings of these findings in relation to the development of AD remain poorly understood.\nResults from studies of the AD mouse model Tg2576 crossed onto an SNCA knockout background proposed that loss of \u03b1Syn increased the A\u03b2 plaque load in all forebrain areas by the age of 18 months [23] . In support, it was found that \u03b1Syn inhibited amyloid plaque formation in APPPS1 mice co-expressing the SNCA gene. The authors of the same study further demonstrated that the seeding activity of injected A\u03b2 containing brain homogenates was reduced, and that A\u03b2 deposition was suppressed in grafted tissue from the [A30P]aSYN transgenic mouse model [2] . The mechanisms underlying the inverse association between A\u03b2 plaque formation and \u03b1Syn have yet to be determined, and may be complicated by the existence of various \u03b1Syn species (monomers, oligomers, fibrils) which individually may have differing effects on AD pathophysiology. For example, Larson et al. recently reported that increasing oligomeric \u03b1Syn selectively decreased presynaptic proteins and cognitive performance in the bigenic J20xTgI2.2 AD mouse model where both monomeric and oligomeric \u03b1Syn increase with age, [27] .\nIn addition to the overlapping neuropathological features between AD and synucleinopathies like PD and DLB, but not multiple system atrophy [42] , these disorders also share the APOE\u03b54 allele as a strong genetic risk factor. The APOE\u03b54 allele increases the risk of AD by up to 15-fold and the risk of DLB by up to 6-fold [7, 10] . Furthermore, the APOE\u03b54 allele also increases the risk of PD and decreases the age of disease onset [30] . The exact molecular pathways underlying the increased risk of several neurodegenerative disorders in APOE\u03b54-carriers have yet to be identified but the urgency to do so is clearly illustrated by the rather high frequency (~14%) of this allele in the normal population [32] .\nIn the current study we aimed to assess the pathophysiological relevance of \u03b1Syn levels in CSF to the development of AD, including surrogate markers of AD neuropathology, in a clinical setting. We further aimed to investigate potential effects of the APOE\u03b54 risk allele on identified relationships. For our purposes we used two cohorts, a longitudinally followed cohort of patients with sporadic MCI and AD to investigate potential relationships between \u03b1Syn and disease progression. The second cohort was comprised of a cross-sectional sample from the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer's Disease Network (DIAN) including participants with autosomal dominant mutations in the APP, PSEN1 and PSEN2 genes causing early-onset autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease (ADAD), and their non-mutation carrying relative control participants [3] . The latter cohort was included to enable specific analyses of relationships between \u03b1Syn and the development of symptoms in subjects that will de facto develop Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, inclusion of subjects with ADAD mutations also enabled us to assess potential associations between CSF \u03b1Syn levels and specific mutations in the genes encoding key components in the A\u03b2 peptide production pathway i.e. the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and the presenilins 1 and 2 (PS1 and PS2)."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study participants", "text": "Subjects from two different cohorts were included in the present study. The longitudinally followed cohort totaling n = 136 subjects, including n = 52 subjects that were cognitively healthy controls and n = 84 patients who at baseline were diagnosed with sporadic MCI (n = 57) or AD (n = 27). Clinical diagnoses of MCI or AD were based on the International Working Group on Mild Cognitive Impairment Criteria [63] and the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria [34, 35] . The clinical workup and results from parts of this cohort were previously reported [5, 6, 45] . Briefly, consenting participants were recruited by the Department of Neurology at Trondheim University Hospital in Trondheim, Norway on the conditions that individuals had adequate vision and hearing, did not exhibit high alcohol consumption or use of anti-coagulation medication, and had no psychiatric or malignant disease. Cognitively healthy control subjects were recruited from elderly caregivers who were not genetically related to the patients or from societies for retired people in central Norway. Cerebrospinal fluid was drawn at baseline and at intervals of 12-months follow-up examinations over two years. Control individuals had their CSF sampled at baseline only, due to restrictions pertaining to ethical permits; however, they were clinically assessed both at baseline and at the study-end. Cerebrospinal fluid sampling and CSF AD biomarker analysis (for research purposes only) including quantification of A\u03b2 1-40 , A\u03b2 , total tau (t-tau) and tau phosphorylated at Thr181 (p-tau) levels were previously described [6] . Both patient and control groups were APOE genotyped from blood samples and underwent cerebral volumetric 3-Tesla MRI (3T-MRI) brain imaging at baseline and after two years. Upon completion of the study, MCI patients were re-classified into two groups based on their baseline and two-year follow-up diagnoses. Patients diagnosed with MCI at baseline and who remained diagnosed with MCI after two years were classified as MCI-MCI (n = 30), while patients who were MCI at baseline but that fulfilled the clinical criteria for AD after two years were classified as MCI-AD (n = 27). The studies performed on this cohort were approved by the regional ethics committee in Trondheim, Norway (2010/226) and Stockholm, Sweden (2016/771-31/4) and carried out in agreement with the Helsinki Declaration.\nParticipants in the second cohort were a cross-sectional sample from the multi-site Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer's Network (DIAN) (https://dian.wustl.edu/our-research/observational-study/). The DIAN registry includes mutation carrying and non-mutation carrying adult biological children from families in which one parent carries an ADAD causative mutation in the APP, PSEN1 or PSEN2 genes. At inclusion, and during subsequent visits, DIAN participants were assessed neuropsychologically, biochemically (CSF and plasma), and underwent structural neuroimaging using 3T-MRI, and functional neuroimaging using PET combined with either fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) or PiB to quantify brain glucose metabolism and A\u03b2 deposition respectively [4] . Updated datasets are generated biannually in what are termed dataset \"freezes\". For the current study we examined subjects from the DIAN dataset freeze-10 including a total of n = 92 ADAD mutation carriers: n = 24 APP, n = 50 PSEN1, and n = 18 PSEN2 mutation carriers, as well as n = 50 non-mutation carriers who were genetically related to the mutation carriers but did not harbor ADAD mutations. Included subjects were considered as symptomatic if fulfilling the criteria for a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) score \u2265 0.5. The purposes of the current study involving DIAN participants were approved by the local ethics committee in Stockholm, Sweden (2016/2114-31/4) and the study was carried out in agreement with the Helsinki Declaration."}, {"section_title": "\u03b1Syn quantification", "text": "Quantification of CSF \u03b1Syn in samples from both cohorts was performed using a commercially available sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (AnaSpec; California, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions and using overnight incubation at 4\u00b0C for the sample incubation step. Samples were assayed alongside freshly prepared standard curves for each individual assay. Standards, study subject and internal control samples were run in duplicates and averaged. Spike recovery experiments were performed to assess matrix effects by adding known concentrations of the supplier-provided \u03b1Syn standard to diluted CSF resulting in a spike recovery range of 99-122%. Intra-and inter-assay coefficients of variation were determined by repeated analysis of pooled CSF samples as internal controls resulting in coefficients of variation of < 15% respectively for the two lots of assays used to quantify \u03b1Syn in the two cohorts."}, {"section_title": "DIAN participant MRI image acquisition", "text": "Structural MRI acquisition was performed using the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) protocol [21, 22] .

A high quality, whole-brain image with 1.1 \u00d7 1.1 \u00d7 1.2 mm voxels was acquired in approximately 5-6 min.

Each site underwent an initial evaluation to ensure compliance with common PiB-PET ADNI protocols. Amyloid imaging was performed with a bolus injection of \u223c15 mCi of PiB. Dynamic acquisition consisted of either a 70-min scan starting at injection or a 30-min scan beginning 40 min post injection. For analysis, the PiB-PET data within the common time frame between 40 and 70 min was used. The ADNI PET Core verified that all PET images were acquired using the established protocol and substantially free of artifacts.\nEach subject's PET data were motion-corrected and registered to their MRI using methods described in detail elsewhere [11, 49] . For each participant, the T1-weighted MRI image was segmented into grey and white matter tissue maps. An inclusive binary gray matter mask was subsequently applied to the resulting atlas to obtain individual gray matter atlases. An automated quantitative image analysis approach was applied using regions of interest generated with FreeSurfer [14] using an in-house software previously described [36, 40, 54] . A regional spread function based approach for partial volume correction of PET data was subsequently implemented using FreeSurfer regions [48] to generate partial volume corrected regional PET data. Partial volume corrected PiB data were used to quantify PiB retention, as it was demonstrated to produce accurate results [53] .\nRegional partial volume corrected PiB retention data was evaluated in all FreeSurfer regions of interest in Standardized Uptake Value Ratio (SUVR) units, using the brainstem as reference, as this was reported as optimum quantification procedure for PiB-PET in DIAN studies [53] . Overall brain PiB retention was given by the mean cortical PiB retention, calculated as the average PiB SUVR across four cortical regions (prefrontal, gyrus rectus, lateral temporal, and precuneus) as previously used [44] . In addition, exploratory analyses were performed across forty-two bilateral regions of interest from the FreeSurfer atlas. PiB positivity was defined by a mean cortical SUVR uptake using partial volume corrected data and the brainstem as reference region \u22650.72 cutoff value, equivalent to an SUVR of \u22651.42 if using the cerebellar grey matter, as previously described [56] ."}, {"section_title": "Statistics", "text": "Normal distribution of the data was assessed by use of the Shapiro-Wilk test. Accordingly, statistical tests applied for cross-sectional group comparisons were either non-parametric (Kruskal-Wallis tests followed by pairwise comparisons with the Mann-Whitney U test) or parametric (analysis of variance [ANOVA] or analysis of covariance [ANCOVA] with age entered as covariate when relevant, followed by pairwise comparisons when appropriate, performed with the Student's t-test). The Bonferroni correction was applied to account for multiple comparisons.\nIn the longitudinal cohort, CSF \u03b1Syn levels did not follow a normal distribution and were therefore log-transformed to achieve normal distribution of the data for which parametric tests were used. Longitudinal changes were assessed using the repeated measures multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) approach, and correlation analyses were performed by use of the Spearman's rank correlation test on non-log-transformed data. Data is presented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation or as median with range (min-max). A p-value of \u22640.05 was considered statistically significant.\nIn order to compare CSF \u03b1Syn levels between subjects with AD pathological versus non-pathological CSF AD biomarker levels receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were performed for the longitudinal cohort using the clinical status (cognitively healthy controls versus a baseline AD diagnosis) as the dichotomous variable to establish biochemical cutoff values. Cutoff values were determined based on the highest Youden index defined as sensitivity + specificity \u2212 1.\nIn the DIAN cohort, CSF \u03b1Syn levels did not follow a normal distribution hence we log-transformed the data so that the association between \u03b1Syn with estimated years from symptom onset (EYO) was evaluated using the Pearson's correlation test. For brain PiB-PET imaging-related CSF \u03b1Syn analyses, linear regression was applied to predict regional PiB-retention as a function of CSF \u03b1Syn and EYO as independent variables, separately in ADAD mutation carriers and non-mutation carriers. The same linear regression model was applied after mutation carriers were stratified into asymptomatic (CDR < 0.5) and symptomatic (CDR \u2265 0.5) mutation carriers, as well as for the subset of PiB-positive asymptomatic mutation carriers. Additionally, in mutation carriers the interaction of \u03b1Syn and APOE\u03b54 status (positive/negative) was investigated to elucidate whether the relationship of regional PiB retention and \u03b1Syn is influenced by APOE\u03b54 status. Finally, regional PiB retention was modeled as a function of \u03b1Syn and EYO separately in APOE\u03b54-positive and APOE\u03b54-negative mutation carriers.\nAll statistical analyses concerning CSF \u03b1Syn levels and their association to parameters unrelated to brain imaging were performed in JMP software v.12.1.0 (SAS Institute Inc.). Statistical analyses regarding associations between CSF \u03b1Syn and amyloid PET data in the DIAN cohort were performed using the R v.3.1.0 software (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing, http://www.r-project.org/). Graphical representations of significant linear associations were obtained with the ggplot2 package v.1.0.1, as implemented in R. The significance level for all statistical tests and models was set at p \u2264 0.05. On the brain volumes, display of regression standardized \u03b2 coefficients of the significant associations between CSF \u03b1Syn and regional PiB-PET were performed using BrainNet viewer [67] (http://www.nitrc.org/projects/bnv/) implemented in MATLAB."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "Descriptive statistics of the longitudinally followed cohort of sporadic patients\nThe demographics and clinical characteristics of the longitudinal cohort were in part previously published [45] and are shown in Table 1 . The control group was significantly older than the MCI and AD patient groups, thus age was added as a covariate when including control subjects in the statistical analyses. At the two-year follow-up 48% of the subjects diagnosed with MCI at baseline had progressed to an AD diagnosis (MCI-AD), whereas 52% remained stable (MCI-MCI). The patient dropout rate at 24-months was 17% of the MCI-MCI patients, 7% of the MCI-AD patients, and 15% of the AD patients. As expected, the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores differed significantly amongst the investigated groups with AD patients displaying the lowest scores (p < 0.001). In comparison to controls all individual patient groups exhibited altered levels of CSF AD biomarkers including A\u03b2 1-42 , A\u03b2 1-40 , A\u03b2 42/40 , t-tau and p-tau. A much lower frequency of APOE\u03b54 carriers was observed in the control group (38%) compared to the MCI (66%) and AD patient groups (82%) (p < 0.001).\nHigher baseline CSF \u03b1Syn levels in MCI patients converting to sporadic AD We first sought to compare CSF \u03b1Syn levels between the diagnostic groups. At baseline, MCI patients that after 24 months fulfilled the criteria for an AD diagnosis MCI = mild cognitive impairment MCI-MCI = MCI patients who remained MCI at the 24-month follow up MCI-AD = MCI patients who converted to Alzheimer's disease at the 24-month follow up MMSE = Mini-Mental State Examination score a = mean \u00b1 standard deviation b = median (minimum-maximum) c = P-value reflecting potential differences between the groups Controls, mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease d = \u03c7 2 test e = one-way ANOVA f = Kruskal-Wallis test -= non-significant ** = p \u2264 0.01 *** = p \u2264 0.001 (MCI-AD) exhibited the highest CSF \u03b1Syn levels compared to controls (Fig. 1a) , while CSF \u03b1Syn levels did not significantly differ between controls and the non-converting MCI patients (MCI-MCI), and the AD group (Fig. 1a) . No differences in CSF \u03b1Syn levels were noted between the patient groups at either the 12-month (Fig. 1b) or 24-month (Fig. 1c) follow-ups.\nAssociation between APOE\u03b54 and higher CSF \u03b1Syn levels in sporadic AD patients As APOE\u03b54 is a common genetic risk factor for both synucleinopathies and AD [7, 10, 30] , we assessed the effect of APOE\u03b54 on CSF \u03b1Syn levels. Within the MCI patient group APOE\u03b54 carriers exhibited higher \u03b1Syn levels compared to non-carriers at the 24-month follow up (Fig. 2c) . Additionally, MCI-AD APOE\u03b54 carriers exhibited higher CSF \u03b1Syn than non-carriers at the 12-month (Fig. 2e ) and 24-month ( Fig. 2f) follow-ups. The MCI-AD APOE\u03b54 carrying patient group also exhibited significantly higher CSF \u03b1Syn levels at baseline compared to APOE\u03b54 carrying MCI-MCI patients and controls (Fig. 3a) , while no differences in CSF \u03b1Syn were found at the 12-month follow up (Fig. 3b) . However, at 24-months MCI-AD APOE\u03b54 carriers again had higher CSF \u03b1Syn than MCI-MCI APOE\u03b54 carriers (Fig. 3c) . This difference in CSF \u03b1Syn levels was absent when comparing APOE\u03b54 non-carrier patient groups at any time point (Fig. 3d-f ) . Intriguingly, the elevated CSF \u03b1Syn levels found in MCI-AD patients exhibited a dose-dependent relationship with the APOE\u03b54 allele at all three time points (Fig. 4a-c) .\nTo assess any longitudinal changes in CSF \u03b1Syn levels occurring within-or between the patient groups we performed repeated measures MANOVAs spanning the intervals of: baseline to 12-months, baseline to 24-months, and 12-months to 24-months (Fig. 5) . When all patients (diagnosed with MCI or AD at baseline) were grouped as either APOE\u03b54 carriers or non-carriers, APOE\u03b54 carriers showed increasing CSF \u03b1Syn levels (+ 17%) from baseline to 12-months, followed by a decrease (\u2212 10%) from 12-to 24-months (Fig. 5a ). Patients that did not carry the APOE\u03b54 variant consistently exhibited a longitudinal decline in CSF \u03b1Syn levels which reached statistical significance between the 12-and 24-months examinations (Fig. 5a) , thus proposing potentially different pathological processes for APOE\u03b54 carriers versus non-carriers. These findings prompted us to also subdivide the MCI-AD patient group into APOE\u03b54 carriers or non-carriers. We found a significant increase in CSF \u03b1Syn (+ 5%) in MCI-AD APOE\u03b54 carriers from baseline to 12-months, while also observing elevated CSF \u03b1Syn in MCI-AD APOE\u03b54 carriers versus non-carriers from 12-to 24-months (Fig. 5b) . Moreover, when the MCI-AD patient group was further subdivided by APOE\u03b54 zygosity we found significant differences in CSF \u03b1Syn levels from baseline to 12-months, and 12-to 24-months (Fig. 5c) . A significant difference between APOE\u03b54 homozygotes, heterozygotes, and non-carriers was also found in the AD group between 12-months and 24-months (data not shown)."}, {"section_title": "Links between CSF \u03b1Syn, AD biomarkers and cognition in sporadic patients", "text": "In the absence of established brain imaging tools to assess ante-mortem \u03b1Syn burden in the brain, we assessed potential correlations between CSF \u03b1Syn levels and established fluid surrogate markers of AD pathology and global cognitive test scores.

In MCI-MCI patients the correlations of CSF \u03b1Syn to CSF A\u03b2 1-40 and p-tau strengthened from baseline to 24-months, while the MCI-AD group exhibited the strongest correlation between CSF \u03b1Syn and t-tau (all above Spearman's \u03c1 = 0.9 respectively) ( Table 2 ). The AD group exhibited a modest increase in the correlations between CSF \u03b1Syn and CSF t-tau and p-tau between baseline and 12-months, but showed weakening of the correlation between CSF \u03b1Syn and A\u03b2 1-40 over the same time interval. Additionally, at 24-months the AD group was the only group of patients at any time point to exhibit a significant correlation between CSF \u03b1Syn and A\u03b2 . At 24-months however, the AD group exhibited the weakest correlations between CSF \u03b1Syn and the CSF AD biomarker panel. Intriguingly, our analyses revealed a significant association between CSF \u03b1Syn levels and cognition, in which higher CSF \u03b1Syn levels were significantly correlated to lower MMSE scores in the MCI-AD group at baseline (Table 2) ; moreover, the correlation was solely attributable to APOE\u03b54 carrying MCI-AD patients (\u03c1=-0.607, p=0.005) (non-carrier \u03c1=-0.618, p=0.140).\n\u03b1Syn levels in sporadic patients with or without pathological CSF AD biomarkers\nThe MCI and AD patients enrolled in the longitudinal cohort were diagnosed according to clinical guidelines [34, 63] without workup of CSF AD biomarkers to support the clinical diagnosis, however, for research purposes the CSF biomarkers were assessed. With the rationale to compare CSF \u03b1Syn levels between patients with pathological versus without pathological CSF AD biomarker levels, we employed ROC analyses to produce cutoffs for the core CSF AD biomarkers Fig. 4 Cerebrospinal fluid \u03b1Syn levels in MCI-AD patients at: a baseline (non-carrier n = 7, heterozygous n = 9, homozygous n = 11), b 12-months (non-carrier n = 7, heterozygous n = 8, homozygous n = 11), and c 24-months (non-carrier n = 7, heterozygous n = 8, homozygous n = 9). P-values are presented first as uncorrected followed by Bonferroni corrected (a-c: n = 3 comparisons). In a P-values were calculated using the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis with post-hoc testing by use of the Mann-Whitney U test. Bonferroni correction was used to account for multiple comparisons. In (b-c) P-values were calculated using the one-way ANCOVA with age entered as a covariate with post-hoc testing by use of the student's t-test. Results are displayed without age-correction (raw data). MCI-AD = MCI patients who converted to Alzheimer's disease at the 24-month follow up conventional ratios thereof [47] . We then stratified the patients into groups with and without pathological CSF AD biomarker levels (Fig. 6 ). Cutoffs were determined by comparing AD biomarker levels between cognitively healthy controls and AD patients at baseline. The resulting ROC axes were labeled as sensitivity and 1-specificity; the accompanying results table provided the individual cutoff values, sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the curve (AUC) with its respective 95% confidence interval (95% CI) (Fig. 6 ).

Additionally, the CSF p-tau/ A\u03b2 42 cutoff (> 0.126) applied in the AD patient group showed that the CSF(+) group had higher CSF \u03b1Syn than the CSF(\u2212) group (Fig. 7c) ."}, {"section_title": "Descriptive statistics of DIAN participants", "text": "In the ADAD mutation carrying participants from the DIAN study, n = 6 APP, n = 33 PSEN1 and n = 3 PSEN2 mutations were represented (data not shown).

Specifically, 37.5% of APP, 42.0% of PSEN1 and 11.1% of PSEN2 mutation carriers were symptomatic (Table 3 ). More than half of the PSEN2 mutation carriers carried the APOE\u03b54 allele, whereas a quarter of the APP mutation carriers and less than 20% of the PSEN1 mutation carriers were APOE\u03b54 carriers (Table 3) . In all three ADAD mutation groups, there was a higher percentage of APOE\u03b54 carriers amongst the symptomatic mutation carriers (p < 0.01). Further, we found significant variability in the EYO, MMSE and CDR scores, and CSF levels of A\u03b2 1-42 , A\u03b2 42/40 , t-tau, and p-tau between ADAD mutation carriers and non-mutation carriers (Table 3) .

Age of examination, EYO, MMSE and CDR scores, CSF A\u03b2 42/40 , A\u03b2 1-42 , t-tau, and p-tau significantly differed between symptomatic and asymptomatic PSEN1 mutation carriers, while no differences could be observed in the PSEN2 mutation carriers due to insufficient sample size (Table 3) .\nCerebrospinal fluid \u03b1Syn levels in ADAD mutation carriers are related to onset of cognitive symptoms\nAfter pooling all individual gene mutations into their respective groups (APP, PSEN1 and PSEN2 mutation carriers) we compared the CSF \u03b1Syn levels between the three groups and found no significant differences between the groups of ADAD mutation carriers or versus non-mutation carriers (Fig. 8a) . Upon subdividing the ADAD mutation carriers into either asymptomatic or symptomatic individuals we found that symptomatic mutation carriers had higher CSF \u03b1Syn compared to non-mutation carriers (Fig. 8b) ; no further differences were found when APOE\u03b54 status was included as a covariate (data not shown). Importantly, the temporal trajectory of CSF \u03b1Syn versus EYO showed a weak-to-moderate increase in both ADAD mutation carriers (Pearson's R = 0.20; p = 0.056) and in non-carriers (Pearson's R = 0.31; p = 0.032), where the confidence bands around both trajectories showed a substantial overlap (Fig. 8c) ."}, {"section_title": "Cerebrospinal fluid \u03b1Syn and AD biomarker associations in the DIAN cohort", "text": "To assess links between CSF \u03b1Syn levels and AD brain pathology using surrogate CSF AD biomarkers in the DIAN participants we investigated potential correlations between CSF \u03b1Syn and CSF levels of A\u03b2 1-42 , A\u03b2 1-40 , A\u03b2 42/40 , t-tau, and p-tau in ADAD non-mutation carriers and the three ADAD mutation carrier groups sorted into asymptomatic and symptomatic subgroups (the n = 2 PSEN1 symptomatic patient group was excluded from analysis) ( Table 4) .

Inverse correlations between CSF \u03b1Syn and A\u03b2 42/40 were found in symptomatic APP and PSEN1 mutation carriers, but most notably in the symptomatic APP mutation carrier group (Table 4) .

The frequency of PiB-positive ((SUVR/brainstem) \u22650.72) subjects was; 49.1% (28/57) of asymptomatic mutation carriers, 89.3% (25/28) of symptomatic mutation carriers, and 4.3% (2/47) of non-mutation carriers. As expected, PiB-retention increased with EYO in mutation carriers, while no significant increase was noted in non-mutation carriers (data not shown). Potential associations between CSF \u03b1Syn levels and in vivo amyloid plaque burden in subjects from the DIAN cohort were investigated by analyzing the linear regressions of mean cortical PiB-retention versus CSF \u03b1Syn in ADAD mutation carriers and non-mutation carriers separately, as well as stratifying mutation carriers into asymptomatic and symptomatic groups, adding EYO as independent predictor in all regression models; these four models resulted in no significant associations between mean cortical PiB and \u03b1Syn (Table 5) Fig. 9a in which the regional regression \u03b2 coefficients are displayed on a 3D brain surface. The strongest associations between CSF \u03b1Syn and amyloid plaque load in PiB-positive asymptomatic ADAD mutation carriers were found in regions including the posterior cingulate, superior temporal and frontal (Fig. 9a) . A potential effect of APOE\u03b54 on the association between PiB and \u03b1Syn in ADAD mutation carriers was assessed by the linear regression model: Mean cortical PiB~\u03b1Syn + APOE\u03b54 + EYO + \u03b1Syn*APOE\u03b54, and results are presented on Table 5 . The interaction of \u03b1Syn*APOE\u03b54 was significant, indicating that the relationship between PiB-retention and \u03b1Syn is different in APOE\u03b54-positive than in APOE\u03b54-negative ADAD mutation carriers. In APOE\u03b54-positive ADAD mutation carriers, there was a strong positive association between \u03b1Syn and mean cortical PiB (\u03b2 = 0.39, p = 0.032) ( Table 5 ), while this association was not significant in APOE\u03b54-negative mutation carriers (\u03b2 = \u2212 0.10, p = 0.348) (data not shown). Exploratory positive associations between \u03b1Syn and regional PiB in APOE\u03b54-positive ADAD mutation carriers in the 42 regions of interest are illustrated on the 3D brain display, showing strong associations in regions including the superior temporal, anterior and posterior cingulate, parietal and frontal regions (Fig. 9b) .

Although the significance of CSF \u03b1Syn levels to brain parenchymal \u03b1Syn levels are still unknown, mainly due to the lack of ante-mortem \u03b1Syn brain imaging tools, we anticipate that CSF \u03b1Syn fluctuations mirror \u03b1Syn alterations in the brain. We studied subjects with MCI, sporadic AD and ADAD in order to pinpoint any potential pre-clinical, prodromal, or mid-to late stage disease pathways linking \u03b1Syn to AD pathogenesis. We further explored the impact of the AD risk allele APOE\u03b54 on the identified associations. Numerous studies have reported \u03b1Syn pathology in approximately 50-60% of autopsied AD patients [1, 16, 31] . Patients with mixed pathologies as well as animal models expressing combined AD and \u03b1Syn pathologies tend to exhibit amplified deterioration, typically enduring more severe symptoms and shorter survival rates [9, 41] . Interestingly, Wirths and colleagues described co-accumulation of \u03b1Syn in A\u03b2 plaques and dystrophic neurites only in patients with the Lewy body variant of AD rather than in 'typical AD' cases [65] . Furthermore, results from another study of 147 neuropathologically confirmed AD cases suggested that the majority of AD patients who exhibited very few or no neocortical neurofibrillary tangles, termed 'plaque-only AD' , exhibited Lewy body \u03b1Syn pathology, while patients with the Lewy body variant of AD were found to be 'plaque-only AD' cases, hence, 'plaque-only AD' and Lewy body variant AD were diagnostically indistingushable from one another [17] . Currently, the mechanisms driving comorbid \u03b1Syn and AD pathologies have yet to be elucidated making it impossible to predict comorbidity or to diagnose patients ante-mortem, however, we speculate that altered CSF \u03b1Syn may be a predictive feature of AD patients that already are harboring or that will develop \u03b1Syn co-pathology.\nThe identification of a molecular interaction between presenilin 1 (PS1), encoded by the PSEN1 gene, and \u03b1Syn was suggested to in part explain the clinical and pathophysiological overlaps between AD and synucleinopathies like DLB [64] . The relevance of this molecular interaction was illustrated by two previous reports demonstrating a strong association between ADAD-causing PSEN1 mutations and Lewy body pathology specifically in the amygdala [29, 31] . With a direct interaction between \u03b1Syn and PS1, the latter of which is a key player in A\u03b2 peptide production [8] , it is tempting to speculate that \u03b1Syn may have a modulatory role in A\u03b2 production and/or deposition. In support, our current study revealed an association between higher CSF \u03b1Syn levels and amyloid plaque burden in several brain areas of PiB-positive asymptomatic ADAD mutation carriers. [44] , exhibited a striking overlap with the brain regions for which we found significant positive correlations between CSF \u03b1Syn and PiB-retention. Similarly, a recent study of cognitively normal individuals with subjective memory complaints documented a positive association between CSF \u03b1Syn concentrations and brain A\u03b2 deposition [59] . Rather surprisingly, our identified relationship between CSF \u03b1Syn levels and A\u03b2 deposition in presymptomatic ADAD patients was not paralleled by any significant correlations between CSF \u03b1Syn and A\u03b2 1-42 levels. Instead, CSF \u03b1Syn levels were consistently positively associated with CSF A\u03b2 1-40 levels levels across all studied groups. The relevance of CSF A\u03b2 in the presymptomatic stage of AD, during which A\u03b2 deposition occurs, remains to be determined.\nIn support of our own results [61, 62] and those reported by other groups [60] we further identified strong positive correlations between CSF \u03b1Syn and CSF t-tau and p-tau in both studied cohorts. By stratifying the studied sporadic MCI and AD patients based on pathological CSF AD biomarker levels, we found elevated CSF \u03b1Syn levels in patients that exhibited pathological CSF tau but not A\u03b2 levels. Similar to CSF levels of tau, CSF \u03b1Syn levels were previously proposed to potentially function as a marker of synapse loss and neurodegeneration [43] , however the lack of significantly altered levels of CSF \u03b1Syn in AD does not support this notion. A direct link between \u03b1Syn and tau pathology was instead suggested by findings showing that \u03b1Syn promotes GSK-3\u03b2-mediated tau phosphorylation [25] . The authors of the same study further demonstrated that \u03b1Syn directly interacted with both tau and GSK-3\u03b2. Another in vitro study employing rat PC12 cells demonstrated that extracellular \u03b1Syn in fact was involved in GSK-3\u03b2-mediated hyperphosphorylation of tau [15] . In a b c d Fig. 10 Significant associations between CSF \u03b1Syn and regional PiB-retention in PiB-positive asymptomatic (CDR < 0.5, n = 28) ADAD mutation carriers (blue) and in symptomatic (CDR \u22650.5, n = 25) ADAD mutation carriers (purple) . The significant associations between CSF \u03b1Syn and PiB are represented by the standardized \u03b2 coefficient corresponding to independent predictor \u03b1Syn in the linear regression model for PiB~\u03b1Syn + EYO, where EYO is estimated years from symptom onset, in four brain regions (a-d)\ncognitively intact control subjects we found strong positive correlations between levels of CSF \u03b1Syn and both t-tau and p-tau, which in our view may challenge the notion that the relationship between \u03b1Syn and tau is indeed pathological. Due to our findings of a consistent correlation between CSF \u03b1Syn and tau levels across diagnostic groups including healthy controls, we speculate that the this association might be due to non-conventional exosome-related release mechanisms [12, 51] for both tau and \u03b1Syn, without any clear disease association. The exact relevance of the described seemingly robust relationship between levels of CSF tau and \u03b1Syn requires clarification, preferably in future studies assessing potential links between CSF \u03b1Syn and ante-mortem tau pathology using novel tau tracers and imaging techniques [50] . With the APOE\u03b54 allele as a common denominator in terms or risk of disease for both AD and DLB [7] we were interested in assessing potential effects of this gene variant on CSF \u03b1Syn levels in the investigated cohorts. In subjects from the MCI-AD diagnostic group who exhibited elevated CSF \u03b1Syn levels compared to controls at baseline, homozygous APOE\u03b54 carriers exhibited the highest CSF \u03b1Syn levels. This observation was absent in AD patients and control subjects. Hence, we observed an effect of the APOE\u03b54 variant on CSF \u03b1Syn levels in the prodromal phase of sporadic AD, but no effect once patients were clinically diagnosed with AD. When considering any effect of the APOE\u03b54 allele in ADAD mutation carrying DIAN participants, we found no differences in CSF \u03b1Syn between APOE\u03b54 positive versus APOE\u03b54 negative participants, or within the APP, PSEN1 or PSEN2 mutation carrying groups. However, presymptomatic A\u03b2 deposition in ADAD mutation carriers was positively associated with CSF \u03b1Syn levels only in APOE\u03b54 positive subjects. We hypothesize that an association between CSF \u03b1Syn and A\u03b2 deposition at the presymptomatic stage of AD may be further supported by the APOE\u03b54 variant which in previous studies has been shown to promote A\u03b2 deposition even in cognitively intact individuals [40] .\nThe regulatory mechanisms governing \u03b1Syn levels in brain parenchyma and CSF are unknown. However, there is a clear difference between CSF \u03b1Syn levels in AD patients and those with synucleinopathies, where patients afflicted with the latter disorders consistently exhibit reduced levels [18, 24, 38, 39, 56, 57] suggesting a disease-specific process that disrupts the balance between the intracellular and extracellular pools of \u03b1Syn. Kallikrein-6, also called neurosin, is one of few reported extracellular proteases shown to cleave \u03b1Syn [52, 55] . Increasing the expression of kallikrein-6 in the brains of a mouse model of Lewy body disease promoted \u03b1Syn clearance and reduced \u03b1Syn pathology [52] . Further, we have shown that patients with synucleinopathies not only exhibited low CSF \u03b1Syn levels but also reduced levels of kallikrein-6 [62] . Thus, our previous results combined with those from animal studies suggest that an imbalance between \u03b1Syn and kallikrein-6 may promote synucleinopathy. Recently we also reported that the AD and MCI-AD patients examined in the current study did not exhibit altered levels of CSF kallikrein-6 compared to controls, whereas MCI-MCI patients had slightly lower CSF kallikrein-6 levels compared to controls [45] . Hence, the elevated CSF \u03b1Syn levels observed in the MCI-AD group were not paralleled by increased kallikrein-6 levels suggesting a potential imbalance between kallikrein-6 and \u03b1Syn in this group.\nWe conclude, CSF \u03b1Syn levels alone appear unfit to serve as a diagnostic marker for AD however higher CSF \u03b1Syn concentrations were associated with the progression from MCI to sporadic AD, and with the development of symptoms in subjects carrying ADAD mutations. Although not paralleled by significant correlations with CSF A\u03b2 1-42 , higher levels of CSF \u03b1Syn in the presymptomatic stages of ADAD were associated with A\u03b2 plaque burden in several brain regions known to accumulate A\u03b2 pathology during early stages of AD development. The presence of an APOE\u03b54 allele in sporadic AD cases appeared to promote higher CSF \u03b1Syn levels which may accelerate the processes linking \u03b1Syn to A\u03b2 deposition in AD. The APOE\u03b54 allele may be involved in molecular processes governing CSF \u03b1Syn levels, which in turn appear associated with the presymptomatic build-up of A\u03b2 plaque burden in the brain during AD development. Future studies assessing \u03b1Syn in paired CSF and autopsied brain tissues are needed in order to decipher the relevance of altered CSF \u03b1Syn levels in the pathophysiology of AD. "}]
