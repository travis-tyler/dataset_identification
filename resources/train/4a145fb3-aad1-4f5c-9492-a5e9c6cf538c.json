Besides human activities, solar variability is another significant natural contributor. Herschel (1801) first proposed that solar activity may affect the Earth's climate system. Thereafter, various studies confirmed that the Earth's weather and climate changes are significantly affected by solar activity variations. The time scale ranges from several hours or several days (Tinsley and Deen, 1991; Tinsley and Heelis, 1993; Veretenenko and Thejll , 2004; Kniveton and Tinsley, 2004) to a decade or a century, or even longer time scale (Friis-Christensen and Lassen, 1991; Bond et al., 2001; Neff et al., 2001; Wang et al., 2005; Camp and Tung, 2007; van Loon et al., 2007 ).\nThere are two major forms of the solar irradiance, electromagnetic radiation and corpuscular radiation. The electromagnetic radiation is so-called solar photons, and the corpuscular radiation is referred to the solar wind energy flux here, which contains the solar wind, the interplanetary magnetic field, and solar energetic particles. In general, the energy content of electromagnetic radiation enters into the terrestrial system is of 4-5 orders higher than the solar wind energy flux, therefore it is no surprise that most of the researches about the solar influences on the Earth's climate change focused on the effects of solar electromagnetic radiation. However, the variation amplitude of electromagnetic radiation during a solar cycle (about 11 years) is quite small, of only about 1 Wm \u22122 or \u223c 0.1% (Fr\u00f6hlich, 2013) . In contrast, the decadal variation of the solar wind energy flux could even exceed 100%, which makes the absolute vari-2 ation of solar wind energy flux comparative to solar electromagnetic radiation.\nMassive solar wind energy flux entering into geospace (E in ) via magnetic reconnection or viscous interaction can heat the Earth's atmosphere by two major aprroaches, auroral particle precipitation and Joule heating (Vasyliunas, 2011) , and it may drive the Earth's weather and climate change through some nonlinear interaction mechanisms and enlarge its effects significantly. Ge et al. (2015) confirmed the high sensitivity of the TC warm core to solar shortwave radiative effect; Haig and Nott (2016) showed that solar forcing (the number of sunspots) contributes to the TC activities over decadal, interdecadal, and centennial scales.\nMost previous studies on the relationship between solar activity and TCs focused on the effects from solar electromagnetic radiations. To deepen the understanding of TC activities variation tendency and to improve the prediction accuracy of the climate model, it is worthy to explore other possible driving factors. In this study, we pay our attention on the influence of solar wind energy flux on TCs activities. This paper is organized as follows: the data sets are described in section 2; the results are given in section 3; and the plausible mechanism and summary are presented in section 4 and 5."}, {"section_title": "Data Sets", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "TC activities", "text": "International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS) project aims at merging tropical storm information from all the regional specialized meteorological centers and other international centers and individuals into one product, and providing best track data of TCs in a centralized location.

It contains the most complete global set of historical TCs, and is endorsed to be an official archiving and distribution resource for TC best track data by the World Meteorological Organization (Tropical Cyclone Programme).\nIn this study, global TC activity was tabulated by using the IBTrACS Dataset wind speed maximum at 6-hour intervals during the cyclone lifetime (Bell et al., 2000) .

Nevertherless, the global three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulation (3D MHD) model makes it possible to do some estimations. Our previous work (Wang et al., 2014) performed 3D global MHD simulations and proposed a empirical formula to estimate the solar wind energy flux input, which is given as follows:\nHere, E in represents the solar wind energy flux into the magnetosphere in the unit of watts. n SW , V SW , and\nis the solar wind number density in the unit of cm \u22123 , the solar wind velocity in the unit of km/s, and the transverse magnetic field magnitude in the unit of nT, respectively. \u03b8 is the interplanetary magnetic field clock angle.\nThe solar wind parameters can be obtained from the OMNI project, which primarily makes a compilation of hourly-averaged solar wind magnetic field and plasma parameters from several spacecrafts since 1963. All the spacecrafts are in geocentric or L1 (Lagrange point) orbits. The data have been extensively cross compared or cross-normalized, and are well used in space physics studies. Based on the above energy coupling function, the solar wind energy flux entering into the magnetosphere can be obtained when the OMNI 2 data sets are available."}, {"section_title": "Geomagnetic activities", "text": "In this study, the relative ap max is defined to represents the level of geomangeitc activities during TCs, which is obtained as follows\n5 where ap max is the maximum ap index during a TC event. ap max is calculated based on Monte Carlo method. The time duration of a concerned TC event is recorded as \u2206T. We randomly choose a begin time T 0 from 1964 to 2012, and then obtain the maximum ap index from T 0 to T 0 +\u2206T. Then, we repeat the above steps 10 6 times. ap max is the mean value of the 10 6 maximum ap index.\nWhen the relative ap max is much greater than 1, it represents that the TC event is during a very disturbed geomagnetic environment. When the relative ap max is much less than 1, it represents that the TC event is during a very quiet geomagnetic period."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "We present the relationships of the annual parameters, e.g., sunspot number (SSN, Fig. 1A ), total solar irradiation (TSI, Fig. 1B ), solar F10.7 irradiation (F107, Fig. 1C ), tropical sea surface temperature (SST, Fig. 1D ), south oscillation index (SOI, Fig. 1E ), the total energy flux input parameter (E in , If the solar wind energy flux can indeed modulate the global TC activity as shown before, a natural thought is that a TC activity should be more intense during the period when more solar wind energy flux enters into the magnetosphere. In the early age of space era, there are many data gaps of E in for many\nTCs. Magnetospheric studies reveals that the more solar wind energy flux input would cause more intense geomagnetic disturbances (Li et al., 2012) . The well-used geomagnetic index, 3-hourly ap index, has no data gap for any TC and thus is used as a proxy of E in used here. As shown in Fig. 2A , there is a linear relationship between the solar wind energy input and the ap index, with the correlation coefficient of 0.92. The mentioned natural thought is confirmed by Fig. 2B , which clearly shows that the maximum wind speed of TC events during severe geomagnetic activities tends to be greater than that during quiet geomagnetic activities."}, {"section_title": "Plausible Mechanism", "text": "The modulation mechanism of solar wind energy flux on TC activity remains mysterious. However, previous studies might give some clues. The solar wind energy flux is the primary energy source for the magnetosphere. Vasyliunas We proposed a plausible mechanism to interpret the possible modulation process, as shown in Fig. 3 . As solar activities enhance, the solar wind energy flux increases, resulting in 1) geomagnetic activities enhancements (Li et al., 2012) , 2) reduction of cosmic rays reaching the atmosphere due to an enhanced IMF shielding (Singh and Singh, 2008) , and 3) enhancement of atmosphere heating (Vasyliunas, 2011) . Under an enhanced geomagnetic field environment, the transport coefficient of cosmic rays along the mean magnetic field decreases (Giacalone and Jokipii , 1999) , causing less cosmic rays could reach the atmosphere as well. As a verification, the correlation coefficient between the annual solar wind energy flux and the cosmic ray intensity at Oulu station is -0.79 in our study. The global cloud coverage was found to be positively correlated with cosmic ray flux (Svensmark and Friis-Christensen, 1997) . Thus, the global cloud coverage (tcdc) decreases for enhanced solar activities, and the sea water would absorb more solar irradiance energy and result in an increase of the sea surface temperature (SST) and latent heat. As a major energy source, latent heat release could issue in rapid intensification and development of tropical cyclones (Pauley and Smith, 1988; Kuo and Low-Nam, 1990) . Meanwhile, the gradient of sea level pressure (SLP) from the continent to the sea enhances as the tcdc decrease. The enhancements of the SLP gradient and the atmosphere heating contribute to the reduction of the vertical wind shear over the tropical oceans, which leads to an enhancement of TC activity (Gray, 1968; Gray et al., 1993) .\nComposite maps in Fig sulting 1982, 1983, 1984, 1989, 1991, 1992, 2003 . Small E in years are defined as the standard- resulting 1963, 1964, 1965, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 .

Almost all of previous studies focused on the effects of solar total irradiation energy. As the second major source, the solar wind energy flux exhibits more significant long-term variations, but its effect has been rarely concerned. Although the energy content of solar wind energy flux is of 4-5 orders lower than that of irradiation energy, its long-term variation is much more significant.\nFor the first time, we find the evidence that the modulation of the solar wind energy flux on the global tropical cyclone activity, and propose a plausible mechanism. We believe this will open a new window to discuss the natural driver of the climate change. In this study, the global tropical cyclone activity is found to be modulated by solar wind energy flux, but not the solar irradiation and the Earth's weather and climate parameters. A possible mechanism is proposed and some evidences are also presented. The findings are helpful to our understanding of solar impact on the Earth's climate change. More attentions on solar wind energy flux is suggested to be paid in the future studies."}]
