[{"section_title": "Motivation:", "text": "Precision Agriculture (PA) refers to a suite of technologies advertising decreased input costs by providing the farm operator detailed production information that can be used to more nearly optimize management practices. In spite of potential cost-savings from the use of yieldmonitoring harvesters, tractor guidance systems, GPS soil mapping, and variable rate input application, adoption has been far from universal. As the demand for high-yielding, high-profit agricultural production continues to surge, why has adoption been fairly low, especially for Variable Rate Technology (VRT)? Do farmers perceive the costs of precision technology to outweigh the benefits or are there other technical barriers to adoption? Some of these technologies are more widespread, so does this imply a hierarchy of adoption? We consider PA technologies both independently and as a suite of complementary goods that each creates information that might be used with another precision technology (Bullock, et al., 2009). The implication of this approach is that while each technology may have value itself, it may be possible to multiply that value several times by combining it with other precision technologies. We explore different combinations of technologies and attempt to discern the characteristics of producers that adopt them and which technologies appear to increase the value of the information the most. These results are used to try to understand the observed lower VRT adoption rates. We utilize the 2010 Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) of corn producers, which collected data on field-level production practices and farm finances. The ARMS collects crucial data on resources required for agricultural production-including seeds, fertilizer, pesticides, machinery, labor, and the use of information technologies, along with yields obtained (Phase II questionnaire) -and expenditures on inputs, as well as farm operator characteristics, such as educational attainment, age, and off-farm income (Phase III questionnaire). 1445 observations from the 2010 corn survey were available for this analysis. ARMS is conducted annually, surveying producers of a rotating set of commodity crops, and descriptive PA data for other years and crops can be found in Schimmelpfennig and Ebel (2011). The 2010 corn survey used in this analysis provides a comprehensive dataset with information on each corn farm's use of precision technologies, costs of production, and demographic profile."}, {"section_title": "Joint Technology Adoption Data Description:", "text": "The \"overall\" columns of the adoption percent bar graph show that yield monitor adoption is over twice as prevalent as either yield mapping or VRT. The \"yield map\" columns show that for those that have adopted yield monitoring, they are far more likely to have also created a yield map that relies on the collection and organization of their yield data. For those producers that take both of these steps, almost 40 percent also make use of VRT. Significant paired t-tests for differences in these mean adoption percentages argues for sequential adoption and an affirmative answer to the first research question posed in the motivation section. Based on the adoption percentages presented in the previous section, we develop a treatmenteffects model designed to exploit this information to reveal the effect of precision agriculture on production costs (Fernandez-Cornejo, 02). This approach allows us to construct profiles of precision technology adopters unlike previous analyses. The treatment-effects approach is necessary because some of the factors hypothesized to cause selection bias between groups of precision agriculture adopters and non-adopters include adoption of other technologies (including herbicide-resistant seed, soil nutrient testing and no-till), operator age and education, and farm size (Ebel and Schimmelpfennig, 2011). Implementing a series of treatment-effects models starting with yield monitoring, then for joint yield monitoring and yield mapping, and finally for these two technologies jointly with VRT allows us to control omitted variable bias from both endogenous and exogenous variables, as well as self-selection (Greene, 2007). Results: This section focuses on discussion of three nested models of precision technology adoption (see \"model\" section), but models substituting soil testing based on global positioning systems (GPS) and guidance systems for yield mapping each gave very similar results. Yield mapping was chosen for presentation because of our intention to show that mapping capability could not have been ruled-out by farmers because of a lack of appropriate data -the farmers in these "}]
