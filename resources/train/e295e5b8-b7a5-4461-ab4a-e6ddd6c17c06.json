[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) are members of the family Coronaviridae, which consists of a group of enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses [1] . Transcription of coronaviruses requires a polymerase template switch, characterized as a discontinuous process unique among RNA viruses [2] [3] [4] . Based on the difference in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four genera, alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV2 [1, 2, 5] . There are hundreds of coronaviruses are circulating broadly among mammals and birds that cause respiratory, enteric, hepatic, and neurologic diseases [1, 6, 7] .\nUntil recently, six coronavirus species have been known to cause disease in humans. The 229E, OC43, NL63 and HKU1 viruses are prevalent and cause mild illness, such as the common cold [1, 8] . However, the other two viruses have been considered highly pathogenic in humans, and cause the diseases SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), which resulted from an outbreak in 2002 and disappeared by 2004, and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome), which emerged in 2012 and continues to circulate in the Middle East [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . At the end of 2019, severe pneumonia cases of unknown etiology were reported in Wuhan, a city in the Hubei province of China [14] [15] . Sequencing analysis revealed that this unidentified pneumonia was considered to be caused by a novel coronavirus [14, 16] . The World Health Organization (WHO) termed the disease as coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) on February 11, 2020 [17] . On the same day, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) named this novel coronavirus as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 has become the seventh coronavirus that known to infect humans. Even though the first cases had a contact history with the Huanan Seafood Market the studies have clearly showed that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted by person-to-person and frequently cause asymptomatic infections. With transmission of the virus possible before the onset of clinical signs, the COVID-19 outbreak has quickly expanded to worldwide [18] [19] [20] . It was declared a pandemic by the WHO on March 11, 2020. As of August 18, 2020, a total of 21,756,357 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 771,635 deaths have been reported in more than 200 countries and territories. (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novelcoronavirus-2019/situation-reports/). The first case of COVID-19 in Turkey was confirmed on March 112020. As of August 18, 2020, there have been 251,805 cases and 6,016 deaths (The Ministry of Health, Turkey).\nIn this study, we report the isolation of the hCoV-19/Turkey/ERAGEM-001/2020 strain from a patient in Turkey with confirmed COVID-19. The whole genomic sequence and replication characteristics of the hCoV-19/Turkey/ERAGEM-001/2020 strain are described. This is the first known report of the isolation and characterization of SARS-CoV-2 from a human clinical sample in Turkey. The successful isolation and characterization of the virus will be essential for continued investigations of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity and will provide valuable information for vaccine design and drug target."}, {"section_title": "Ethics statement", "text": "This study protocol was approved by the Kayseri Training and Research Hospital ethics committee (2020-3-/23), which allowed sampling for diagnostic and surveillance purposes.

In the current outbreak situation, it is crucial to isolate of the causative virus for vaccine strain production, initial characterization of antiviral candidates and evaluation of diagnostic tools. SARS-CoV-2 was first isolated by using human airway epithelial cells on January 7, 2020 [14, 39] . Following to the first isolation of SARS-CoV-2 in China, several groups have also isolated SARS-CoV-2 by using the Vero cell line [40] [41] [42] [43] . In this study, we isolated the SARS-CoV-2 from the nasopharyngeal sample of a patient in Turkey with confirmed COVID-19. Isolation of SARS-CoV-2 was successfully achieved in Vero E6 cells in the absence of trypsin. SARS-CoV-2 caused morphological changes such as rounding, detachment/floating and degeneration (Fig 1B, 1C and 1D ). It is essential to define different target cells for SARS-CoV-2 for further studies on virushost interactions. Chu and colleagues identified different cell lines in which both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 replicated efficiently, but the cytopathic effects were only seen in the nonhuman primate kidney cell lines VeroE6 and FRhK4 [40] . Recently, a study showed that the Vero E6 and Vero CCL81 cell lines were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and exhibited to SARS--CoV-2 specific CPE. These authors found that HUH7.0 and 293T cells showed only modest viral replication but no CPE was observed, suggesting that both Vero cell types support amplification and replication of SARS-CoV-2 but that Vero E6 cells are more suitable for amplification and quantification [42] . In this study, we assessed the susceptibility of Vero E6, MA-104, SW-13 and HeLa cell lines to infection by SARS-CoV-2. We determined that the Vero E6 and MA-104 cell lines were permissive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Initial CPE formation in Vero E6 and MA-104 cell lines infected with SARS-CoV-2 was observed as early as at 24 h postinfection (Figs 1B and 3B, respectively) .

In addition to Vero E6 cells, the MA104 cell line pertaining to its suitability for SARS-CoV-2 proliferation and facilitate further study of SARS-CoV-2. Our results are in agreement with the previous reports showing that SARS-CoV replicated efficiently and caused CPE in Vero and MA-104 cell lines [44] [45] [46] [47] .\nIn order to evaluate the viral growth kinetics of SARS-CoV-2, the Vero E6 and MA-104 cell lines were infected with at an MOI of 0.1. Viral replication was assessed at different time points (6, 12, 18, 24, 48 and 72 h post-infection). We used FFA for all virus titration experiments in this study, since FFA is independent of cell death. SARS-CoV-2 replicated with a similar kinetics in Vero E6 and MA-104 cells, but the MA-104 cells supported replication of SARS-CoV-2 slightly less well than the Vero E6 cells (Fig 6A) . Viral replication could be detected at 12 h post-infection, and continued to increase gradually, peaking at 48 h post-infection (Fig 6A and  6B ). The decline in virus titer at 72 h post-infection which might be due to death of the infected cells or to the cell lysis ( Fig 6A) .

The hCoV-19/Turkey/ERAGEM-001/2020 strain was closely clustered with other strains primarily from Australia, Canada, England, Iran, and Kuwait. The reason for the high fraction of Australian cases in this cluster was possibly due to the high number of submitted sequences, as Australia was the third country that had the most sequences submitted to GISAID by April 2020. The cases in the nearby clusters were reported to have a travel history to Iran and shared the common unique nucleotide substitutions, G1397A, T28688C, and G29742T, which were also found in our strain and partially in several Iranian cases [30] . The common key mutations and similar travel histories of the closely clustered cases may indicate possible links between our case and the Iranian epidemic. Interestingly, hCoV-19/Turkey/ ERAGEM-001/2020 has the G23876A mutation on the S gene, which is not found in any other full genome sequences in GISAID, including the Australian cluster. The lack of some variants (G11083T, G23876A, and C29563T) in the previously sequenced Turkey strains may also show multiple introductions of strains in the early stages of the epidemic.

The whole-genome sequencing of hCoV-19/Turkey/ERAGEM-001/2020 revealed that the strain had 6 variants, compared to the MN908947.3 reference genome.

The mutations at 1397 and 23876 are non-synonymous, leading to a change from Valine to Isoleucine in genes ORF1ab and S (Table 1) . The phylogenetic analysis showed that hCoV-19/Turkey/ERAGEM-001/2020 was located outside of the main clades (S, G, and V) and clustered with SARS-CoV-2 isolates from Australia, Canada, England and Kuwait (Fig 7) . This geographically dispersed cluster is known to be branched in the early period of the epidemic and genetically clustered very closely together. Our strain shared three distinct mutations (G1397A, T28688C, and G29742T) with all members of this cluster, and those mutations were not observed in other known clusters. According to published case reports and GISAID metadata entries, at least 9 SARS-CoV-2 samples in the nearby clusters had a recent travel history to Iran [30] . Those samples in nearby clades include several cases from Pakistan, Kuwait, Canada, and Norway (Fig 7) . The genome sequences of all those cases with a history of travel to Iran share three nucleotide substitutions (G1397A, T28688C, and G29742T) in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, which were also found in the hCoV-19/ Turkey/ERAGEM-001/2020 strain. The GISAID had only one full genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 from Iran, which also included the two key mutations (G1397A and G29742T). In addition, analysis of the NP partial gene sequences of the Iranian samples in GISAID showed that all of the Iranian partial sequences (n = 15) also contain the T28688C, which is another key single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of this clade. Our strain also contained G23876A, a non-synonymous mutation in the S gene, which was not observed in any other full genome sequences in GISAID. The mutation leads to a Val to Ile change at the 772nd position, which is located at one of the inner coil motifs of the S protein. Another mutation in the ORF10 gene (C29563T) is also quite rare and found only in two cases in Australian samples.\nThis study generated the second whole genome sequence of a SARS-CoV-2 strains in Turkey. The first sequence was generated in March 2020 and deposited in GISAID (EPI_ISL_417413). The first sequence was not included in the phylogenetic analysis because of its high number of unique mutations (0.44%). However, the sequence comparison showed that both sequences carry key Iranian cluster mutations including G1397A, T28688C, and G29742T. The G11083T, G23876A, and C29563T nucleotide changes in our strain were not found in the first sequenced strain in Turkey. As of April 2020, a total of 17 SARS-CoV-2 sequences have been submitted to GISAID samples from Turkey. Two of those sequences (Turkey/HGSM/5516/2020 and Turkey/HGSM/8010/2020) were located in the same cluster and share cluster-specific variants (G1397A, T28688C, G29742T). The rest of the submitted strains clustered with several other European clades."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "SARS-CoV-2 is an emerging coronavirus that is highly infectious and efficiently transmitted through droplets and close contact.

We determined that the Vero E6 and MA-104 cell lines might be a good choice of cell culture model for SARS-CoV-2 that supports viral replication kinetics, development of CPE and subsequent cell death. We also showed that hCoV-19/Turkey/ERAGEM-001/2020 was closely clustered with other strains primarily from Australia, Canada, England, Iran, and Kuwait and that the cases in the nearby clusters were reported to have a travel history to Iran and to share the common unique nucleotide substitutions."}, {"section_title": "S1 Raw images.", "text": "(DOCX)"}]
