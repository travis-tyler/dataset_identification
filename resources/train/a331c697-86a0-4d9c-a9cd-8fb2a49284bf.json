Discrimination and sexual harassment are seen as more frequent, and gender is perceived as more of an impediment than an advantage to career success. Three groups of women in STEM jobs stand out as more likely to see workplace inequities: women employed in STEM settings where men outnumber women, women working in computer jobs (only some of whom work in the technology industry), and women in STEM who hold postgraduate degrees. Indeed, a majority of each of these groups of STEM women have experienced gender discrimination at work, according to a nationally representative Pew Research Center survey with an oversample of people working in STEM jobs. These findings come amid heightened public debate about underrepresentation and treatment of women -as well as racial and ethnic minorities -in the fast-growing technology industry and decades of concern about how best to promote diversity and inclusion in the STEM workforce.

But in other respects, the challenges women in STEM face in the workplace echo those of all working women.

The survey, conducted online in English and in Spanish, included an oversample of employed adults working in science, technology, engineering and math fields. See Methodology for details. Most women in STEM jobs who work in majority-male workplaces, in computer jobs or who have a postgraduate degree have experienced gender discrimination at work On average, women working in STEM jobs are more likely than men to say they have experienced workplace discrimination due to their gender. Half (50%) of women in STEM jobs say they have experienced any of eight forms of discrimination in the workplace because of their gender -more than women in non-STEM jobs (41%) and far more than men in STEM occupations (19%). The most common forms of gender discrimination experienced by women in STEM jobs include earning less than a man doing the same job (29%), having someone treat them as if they were not competent (29%), experiencing repeated, small slights in their workplace (20%) and receiving less support from senior leaders than a man who was doing the same job (18%). www.pewresearch.org In workplaces where most employees are men, about half of women in STEM say their gender has been an impediment to success on the job Pioneering work from business school professor Rosabeth Moss Kanter in the late 1970s drew attention to how the structure of organizations -particularly the balance of minority and majority groups -can influence experiences in the workplace. The majority of women in STEM positions work in majority-female workplaces (55%) or work with an even mix of both genders (25%). But the 19% of women in STEM who work in settings with mostly men stand out from others. Fully 78% of these women say they have experienced gender discrimination in the workplace -compared with 44% of STEM women in other settings. 3 About half (48%) of women in STEM jobs who work with mostly men say their gender has made it harder for them to succeed in their job, compared with just 14% of other women in STEM. One respondent explained it this way: \"People automatically assume I am the secretary, or in a less technical role because I am female. This makes it difficult for me to build a technical network to get my work done. People will call on my male co-workers, but not call on me.\" -White woman, technical consultant, 36 Gender balance in the workplace also tends to matter for women in non-STEM positions but those in STEM stand out especially when it comes to experiences with workplace discrimination, the feeling that they need to prove themselves in order to be respected by coworkers, and their belief that, overall, their gender has made it harder for them to succeed at work. By contrast, for male STEM workers, the gender balance in their workplace is largely unrelated to views about gender equity. 4 There are similar differences, though less pronounced, among women in STEM jobs by their level of education. Women with a postgraduate degree who work in STEM jobs are more likely than other women in STEM to have experienced gender discrimination at work (62%, compared with 41% of women with some college or less education). Roughly a third (35%) of women in STEM with a postgraduate degree believe their gender has made it harder to succeed on the job, compared with just 10% of women in STEM with some college or less education. And, women in STEM with more education are more skeptical that women where they work are usually treated fairly when it comes to opportunities for promotion (52% of those with a postgraduate degree say women are usually treated fairly vs. 76% of women with some college or less working in a STEM job). www.pewresearch.org They feel the need to prove themselves at work all/some of the time +7 Roughly three-quarters of women in computer jobs say they have experienced gender-related workplace discrimination Some 74% of women in computer jobs, such as software development or data science, say they have experienced discrimination because of their gender, compared with 16% of men in these jobs. 5 (This group includes some who work in the tech industry and some who work in other sectors.) 6 Women in computer jobs are less likely than men in such jobs to believe that women are \"usually\" given a fair shake where they work when it comes to opportunities for promotion and advancement (43% of women in computer jobs say this usually occurs, compared with 77% of men). About one-in-five women in STEM and non-STEM jobs say they have experienced sexual harassment at work In the Pew Research Center survey -conducted before the string of prominent sexual harassment allegations and public discussion of these issues on social media outlets and elsewhere -some 22% of working women in the U.S. say they have experienced sexual harassment at work, compared with 7% of working men. The share of women who say they have experienced sexual harassment at work is the same among those in STEM and non-STEM jobs. 7 Women working in STEM are more likely than their male counterparts to regard sexual harassment as at least a small problem in their workplace (36% vs. 28%). As with experience with discrimination, women in STEM jobs who work in majority-male settings and women in computer jobs are particularly likely to say that sexual harassment is at least a small problem where they work. Nearly half (48%) of female STEM workers in majority-male workplaces say that sexual harassment is a problem where they work. About four-in-ten (42%) women in computer jobs consider workplace sexual harassment a problem where they work, compared with three-in-ten (30%) men in computer jobs. Among those in non-STEM occupations, men and women are equally likely to consider sexual harassment a problem where they work. About six-in-ten blacks working in STEM say they have experienced workplace discrimination because of their race Concerns about the underrepresentation of blacks and other racial minorities -and particularly women of color -in the STEM workforce have been ongoing for at least four decades. 8 The Pew Research Center survey finds that, today, black STEM workers are especially likely to say they have experienced discrimination at work because of their race or ethnicity; 62% of blacks in STEM say this, compared with 44% of Asians, 42% of Hispanics and just 13% of whites in STEM jobs. Blacks in STEM jobs tend to report experiences of workplace discrimination due to race more than blacks in non-STEM jobs (62% vs. 50%). 9 Hispanics in STEM and non-STEM jobs are equally likely to say they have experienced workplace discrimination because of their race or ethnicity (42% each). 10 8 See Malcom, Shirley Mahaley, Paula Quick Hall, and Janet Welsh Brown. 1976. \"The Double Bind: The Price of Being a Minority Woman in Science.\" American Association for the Advancement of Science. 9 Differences in reported discrimination in the workplace due to race between blacks in STEM vs. non-STEM jobs should be interpreted with caution due to the smaller number of black respondents in the survey (320 in total). Taking into account the design effect for these subgroups, the difference of 62% of blacks in STEM vs. 50% of blacks in non-STEM jobs saying they have experienced racial discrimination at work -whether in their current or previous jobs -for a two-tailed test is p=.075. 10 There are not enough Asians working in non-STEM jobs in the survey sample for separate analysis. Most blacks in STEM have experienced discrimination; fewer blacks see fair treatment in hiring, promotions % of those in science, technology, engineering and math jobs who say the following Note: Experience of racial/ethnic discrimination based on combined responses to eight items. Whites, blacks and Asians are non-Hispanic only; Hispanics are of any race. Respondents who gave other responses or who did not give an answer are not shown. Source: Survey of U.S. adults conducted July 11-Aug. 10, 2017. \"Women and Men in STEM Often at Odds Over Workplace Equity\"\nAnd, blacks working in STEM jobs are less convinced than white STEM workers that black employees where they work are treated fairly when it comes to hiring and promotions. In all, 43% of blacks in STEM jobs believe that blacks where they work are usually treated fairly during recruitment; 37% say this is the case during promotion and advancement opportunities. By contrast most white STEM workers believe that blacks are usually treated fairly in these processes where they work (78% say this about hiring, 75% about advancement processes). Other Pew Research Center analyses found that black Americans with at least some college experience are more likely to say they have experienced discrimination or been treated unfairly across a range of experiences because of their race or ethnicity, compared with those without any college experience. (There are not enough blacks in STEM jobs in this survey for analysis by levels of education.) While the majority of STEM workers believe their race or ethnicity has made no difference in their ability to succeed in their job, blacks (40%) and Asians (31%) in STEM jobs, followed by Hispanics (19%), are more likely than white STEM workers (5%) to say it has been harder to find success in their job because of their race or ethnicity. STEM workers who believe their race or ethnicity has made it harder to succeed provide a number of explanations, including concerns about the hiring process, promotions and pay equity, and stereotypical beliefs among their coworkers. Some respondents put it this way: \"This 'other-ness' exists intentionally or unintentionally between those of a minority and those of a majority from lacking of common cultural background. Relationships at work appear polite on surface but reluctant tendency in willing to share limited opportunities the same way, which I felt in a previous job where whites and males were overwhelmingly a majority.\" -Asian woman, engineer, 56 '10 '16 The STEM workforce has grown, especially among computer occupations Analysis of the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey shows that employment in STEM occupations has grown 79% since 1990 (from 9.7 million to 17.3 million) with the largest growth occurring in computer occupations (338% growth since 1990). The share of women working in such jobs varies widely both within and across job types (or clusters). Women account for a majority of healthcare practitioners and technicians but are underrepresented in other jobs, particularly computer and engineering positions. While there has been significant progress for women in the life and physical sciences since 1990, the share of women has been roughly stable in other STEM occupational clusters and has gone down 7 The share of women in life and physical sciences has gone up but it has gone down for computer jobs since 1990 Share of women in each of the following science, technology, engineering and math occupations over time Gains in women's representation in STEM jobs have been concentrated among women holding advanced degrees, although women still tend to be underrepresented among such workers. Women are roughly four-in-ten (41%) of all STEM workers with a professional or doctoral degree such as an M.D., D.D.S., or Ph.D. Black and Hispanic workers continue to be underrepresented in the STEM workforce. Blacks make up 11% of the U.S. workforce overall but represent 9% of STEM workers, while Hispanics comprise 16% of the U.S. workforce but only 7% of all STEM workers. Asians are overrepresented in the STEM workforce, relative to their overall share of the workforce, especially among college-educated workers: 17% of college-educated STEM workers are Asian, while 10% of all workers with a college degree are Asian. The representation of women, blacks and Hispanics in STEM has implications for the average earnings of workers in these groups. STEM workers earn more, on average, than workers in non-STEM jobs, even when controlling for educational attainment. One potential barrier for those wishing to enter the STEM workforce is the generally higher level of educational attainment required for many such positions. Among college-educated workers, one-in-three (33%) majored in a STEM field. But only about half (52%) of those with college 11 Estimates of women's representation in STEM jobs vary widely. A 2013 Census Bureau report estimated that 26% of the STEM workforce is female as of 2011 using a definition that omits healthcare practitioners and technicians. Including healthcare practitioners and technicians as part of the STEM workforce has a substantial effect on such estimates because healthcare practitioner and technician jobs make up a large share of the workforce and because such jobs are mostly held by women. Analysis of the \"science-and engineering-related\" workforce in the National Science Foundation's Science and Engineering Indicators 2016 include health-related professions but is limited to those holding at least a bachelor's degree. What's a STEM job? This analysis relies on a broad-based definition of the science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) workforce. STEM jobs are defined solely based on occupation and include: life sciences, physical and Earth sciences, engineering and architecture, computer and math occupations as well as health-related occupations including healthcare providers and technicians. Educators specializing in STEM subjects could not be identified in the analysis of the American Community Survey, though they are included as holding STEM jobs in the analysis of the Pew Research Center survey. While there is often considerable overlap across definitions, there is no commonly agreed definition of the STEM workforce. Thus, caution is warranted in any direct comparisons with other studies. training in a STEM field are currently employed in a STEM job. 12 The rest are working in other fields, with many benefiting from the financial bump in earnings that comes with a STEM degree. The reasons why half of college-educated workers with STEM-related training turn to jobs elsewhere are likely complicated. Among college-educated workers, those who majored in a health professions field are more likely than those who majored in other STEM fields to be working in a job directly related to their degree. About seven-in-ten (69%) women who majored in a health professions field (such as nursing or pharmacy) are working in a healthrelated occupation, as are 61% of men who majored in health professions. But among those who majored in computers or computer science, women are less likely than men to be working in a computer occupation (38% vs 53%). Similarly, women who majored in engineering during their undergraduate studies are less likely than men to be working in engineering jobs (24% vs. 30%). Thus, in two occupational areas with particularly low shares of women, retention of those who meet a key barrier for job entry appears to be lower for women than for men. 12 Estimates of how many STEM-trained workers are \"retained\" in a STEM occupation vary widely across studies. These estimates depend on the definition of STEM occupations as well as what constitutes a STEM major and whether the retention estimates are based on training in a specific field and having a directly related job, as discussed here, or is more broadly defined as working in any STEM job. Fewer women than men who majored in computers work in computer jobs Have more flexibility to balance work/family needs Other notable findings include the following: The public image of STEM jobs includes higher pay and an advantage in attracting young talent compared with other industry sectors In some ways, the public has a very positive view of STEM jobs, as they compare with jobs in other sectors. About seven-in-ten Americans (71%) see jobs in STEM as offering better compensation than jobs in other industries. And, a majority of Americans (58%) consider STEM jobs to attract more of the brightest, most qualified young people. The public is closely divided over whether jobs in STEM make a more meaningful contribution to society or do so to about the same extent as other jobs (45% to 48%). But only a minority think of STEM jobs as being more focused on helping others (28%) than jobs in other industries. About one-in-five Americans (18%) say STEM jobs have more flexibility to balance work and family needs than other jobs in other sectors, while about half (52%) say the flexibility in this regard is about the same as it is in other sectors and 28% say there is less flexibility in STEM jobs than there is elsewhere. Most Americans see STEM jobs as offering higher pay, attracting top talent compared with other industries Men and women working in STEM say flexibility to balance work and family needs is important to them Men and women in STEM jobs -and indeed those in non-STEM jobs as well -say that having the flexibility to balance their work and family obligations is an important factor to them in choosing a job. But men and women in STEM tend to diverge when it comes to other job characteristics. A somewhat higher share of men than women say that having higher pay and opportunities for promotion is important to them in choosing a job. Women in STEM jobs are more inclined to consider a job that focuses on helping others (59%) as important to them compared with men in STEM jobs (31%). 13 13 About two-thirds (68%) of women in health-related jobs say that having a job that is focused on helping others is important to them. However, even excluding workers in health-related jobs, a higher share of women than men working in STEM say that this characteristic is important to them in choosing a job. Men and women in STEM consider job flexibility important, women are more likely to want a job that helps others % of those in science, technology, engineering and math jobs who say when choosing a job, each of the following is personally important to them \nFemale computer workers are also more likely than male computer workers to say that their gender has made it harder to succeed in their job (31% vs. 6%), that they have personally experienced sexual harassment at work (30% vs. 7%), and that their workplace pays too little attention to increasing gender diversity (31% vs. 13%). When it comes to judgments of workplace fairness for women, women working in computer occupations are less likely than men in computer jobs to say women are treated fairly in opportunities for promotion and advancement or in the recruitment and hiring process. While the majority of male computer workers (77%) say that women in their workplace are usually treated fairly in opportunities for promotion and advancement, fewer female computer workers (43%) say the same. Similarly, 83% of male computer workers say women in their workplace are usually treated fairly in recruitment and hiring, compared with 67% of female computer workers. The same Pew Research Center survey asked about people's perceptions of gender discrimination in the technology industry. There, too, women who work in computer jobs are more likely than men in these jobs to consider gender discrimination a major problem in the tech industry (43% to 31%); about twice as many men (32%) as women (15%) who work in these jobs say gender discrimination is not a problem in the industry. About half of women in STEM workplaces with a majority of men think their gender has made it harder to succeed in their job The 19% of women in STEM jobs working in majoritymale workplaces stand out in their views and experiences at work. These women are significantly more likely than women in majority-female workplaces or those in workplaces with an even mix of men and women to say they have experienced at least one of eight forms of genderrelated discrimination at work (78% compared with 43% of those in majorityfemale workplaces) and to think their gender has made it harder to succeed in their job (48% vs. 12% of women in STEM jobs who work in majority-female workplaces). A far greater share of STEM women in majority-male workplaces think there is too little attention to gender diversity at work (43% compared with 16% of women in majority-female workplaces). And, these women are more likely than those in majority-female organizations to consider sexual harassment a problem where they work (48% vs. 32%). Further, women working in STEM jobs in mostly male workplaces are significantly less likely than women in majority-female workplaces or those with an even mix of men and women to say that woman are usually treated fairly in recruitment and hiring (55% say this, compared with 85% of women in workplaces with mostly women) or opportunities for promotion and advancement (38% vs. 70%). By contrast, among men in STEM jobs, gender context is largely unrelated to views on gender equity in the workplace. One exception is that men working in STEM jobs with mostly women are more likely to say they have experienced any of eight types of gender-related discrimination at work (32% say this) than men in mostly male workplaces (15%) or workplaces with an even gender distribution (16%). Women with advanced degrees in the STEM workforce are more likely to see inequities at work There are also differences among women in STEM jobs by their level of education. Women with advanced degrees working in STEM jobs are more likely than other women in STEM jobs to report that they have experienced discrimination in their workplace because of their gender and to say that their gender has made it harder to succeed at work. And, women in STEM jobs who hold a postgraduate degree are less inclined to think women are usually treated fairly when it comes to opportunities for advancement where they work. Similarly, highly educated women working in non- STEM jobs are more likely than women in such jobs with less education to report that they have experienced gender-related discrimination in the workplace either at a current or previous job. By contrast, there are small or no differences among men in STEM jobs by education level across these measures. See Appendix for details.\nWhen asked why they did not end up pursuing a career or job in STEM, the most commonly cited reason was cost and time barriers (27%), such as the large amount of time and money required for education or a general lack of access to resources and opportunities. But others pointed to different reasons for not pursuing a STEM career. One-in-five (20%) say that they chose to pursue a different career instead of STEM, because they developed a different interest. Some 14% say that they did not end up in a STEM career because they struggled to do well in STEM classes or just lost interest in STEM. A similar share (11%) cites personal or family circumstances. There are modest gender differences in reasons cited for not pursuing a career in STEM. Women are more likely than men to cite cost and time barriers (31% vs. 24%) and struggling in STEM classes or losing interest (19% vs. 11%); while men are somewhat more likely to say that they found another interest (23% vs. 17%). Those interested in STEM who did not pursue it cite cost and time barriers, different interests as reasons Perceived issues with STEM careers e.g., lack of jobs, low pay 7 7 7 Perceived obstacles because of gender e.g., women aren't encouraged; no female mentors\n\"Middle-skills\" STEM workers are particularly likely to have had additional training \"Middle-skills\" jobs, which require additional training beyond a high school education but not a four-year college degree, make-up an important part of the STEM workforce. Middleskills jobs are particularly common in computer technology and health care. About three-in-ten STEM workers (28%) have some college experience (including an associate degree) but no bachelor's degree. This is a similar share to those employed in non-STEM occupations (31%). Among those with some college experience, STEM workers earn 35% more than their non-STEM counterparts ($54,745 vs. $40,505). See Chapter 1. STEM middle-skills workers are distinct from middle-skills workers in other occupations because they are more likely to have additional educational training that is directly related to their job. STEM workers are more likely than non-STEM workers to have completed any vocational or technical training, a certificate, or apprenticeship. Among those with some college experience or an associate degree, about seven-in-ten STEM workers (69%) say they have completed this kind of training, compared with about half of non-STEM workers (49%). In addition, among workers with an associate degree, STEM workers are more likely than workers in other occupations to say their job is closely related to their education. Some 77% of STEM workers with an associate degree say their job is very closely related to their degree. In contrast, about three-in-ten (28%) of those working in other occupations say their associate degree is closely related to their current job, while a larger share (42%) say their degree is not related or not very closely related to their job. Similarly, STEM workers with an associate degree are about three times more likely than their non-STEM counterparts to say they use the skills and knowledge from their degree in their current job all the time (73% vs 24%)."}, {"section_title": "Americans see a range of explanations for the underrepresentation of women, blacks and Hispanics in STEM jobs", "text": "Many Americans attribute the limited diversity of the STEM workforce to a lack of encouragement for girls and blacks and Hispanics to pursue STEM from an early age; 39% of Americans consider this a major reason there are not more women in some STEM areas, and 41% say this is a major reason there are not more blacks and Hispanics in the STEM workforce. In addition, 42% of Americans say limited access to quality education to prepare them for these fields is a major reason blacks and Hispanics are underrepresented in the STEM workforce; this view is held by a majority of those working in STEM who are black (73%) and about half of Hispanics (53%), Asians (52%) and whites (50%) in STEM jobs. Perceived reasons more women, blacks and Hispanics are not working in STEM There are wide differences among STEM workers on the role of racial/ethnic discrimination in underrepresentation. Among blacks in STEM jobs, 72% say discrimination in recruitment, hiring and promotions is a major reason behind the underrepresentation of blacks and Hispanics in these jobs. By contrast, 27% of whites and 28% of Asians say this, while 43% of Hispanics think discrimination is a major reason behind the underrepresentation. Similarly, there are wide differences between men and women working in STEM jobs on the role of gender discrimination. About half of women in STEM jobs (48%) say gender discrimination in recruitment, hiring and promotions is a major reason there are not more women in STEM jobs, compared with 29% of men in STEM jobs. When women and those in racial and ethnic minority groups working in STEM were asked to say, in their own words, the best ways to attract more people like themselves to STEM, many emphasized the importance of quality schooling and an early start to encouraging people into the field with repeated support over time. A few examples: \"You must introduce those fields early in the elementary school years. Then continue to build on that by establishing STEM clubs and activities. Provide information to parents about local/community STEM events for continued interests. Most of all, make sure that any STEM student has the rigorous preparation that will be needed to get them accepted into college and able to handle the nature of the college level classes.\" -Black woman, nurse, 49 \"K-8 teaching needs to be designed to make these subjects more interesting and accessible to girls. Teachers need to be explicit about the need for more women in STEM jobs, and help girls feel that they have a reason to pursue these fields in spite of the somewhat intimidating gender breakdown of higher level classes.\" -White woman, math teacher, 42 \"Providing opportunities such as putting upgraded computers and/or science labs in inner-city schools, libraries and community centers. Black men currently in the STEM industries must be visible to the younger generation in order to show the value of those skills and the career implications.\" -Black man, systems engineer, 30 Most Americans rate K-12 STEM education as average or worse compared with other developed nations, so, too, do those with an advanced degree in STEM Americans are generally critical of the quality of STEM education in the nation's K-12 schools. A quarter of Americans (25%) consider K-12 STEM education in the U.S. to be at least above average compared with other developed countries, while 30% say the U.S. is below average in this regard, and 43% say it is average. Parents with children in public schools give similar ratings of the nation's K-12 STEM education. Americans tend to see higher education in STEM more favorably, by comparison, but there too, fewer than half consider undergraduate education (35%) or graduate education (38%) in STEM as at least above average compared with other nations. People who, themselves, have a postgraduate degree in a STEM field give positive ratings to the quality of postsecondary education in the U.S., but just 13% of this group considers K-12 STEM education to be at least above average. Nonetheless, as Americans look back on their own K-12 experiences, three-quarters (75%) report that they generally liked science classes. Science labs and hands-on learning experiences stand out as a key appeal among those who liked science classes. Some 46% of those who disliked science classes in their youth say a reason for their view is that these classes were hard, while another 36% of this group found it hard to see how science classes would be useful to them in the future. Most Americans see K-12 STEM education as average or below that of other developed nations "}, {"section_title": "Diversity in the STEM workforce varies widely across jobs", "text": "As the U.S. has transformed rapidly to an information-based economy, employment in science, technology, engineering and math occupations has grown -outpacing overall job growth. Since 1990, STEM employment has grown 79% (9.7 million to 17.3 million) and computer jobs have seen a whopping 338% increase over the same period. Using a broad definition of the STEM workforce, women make up half (50%) of all U.S. workers in STEM occupations, though their presence varies widely across occupational clusters and educational levels. Women account for the majority of healthcare practitioners and technicians but are underrepresented in several other STEM occupational clusters, particularly in computer jobs and engineering. While there has been significant progress for women in the life and physical sciences since 1990, the share of women has been roughly stable in other STEM occupational clusters and has actually gone down 7 percentage points in the area with the largest job growth over this period: computer occupations, a job cluster that includes computer scientists, systems analysts, software developers, information systems managers and programmers. Gains in women's representation in STEM jobs have been concentrated among women holding advanced degrees, although women still tend to be underrepresented among such workers. Black and Hispanic workers continue to be underrepresented in the STEM workforce. Blacks make up 11% of the U.S. workforce overall but represent 9% of STEM workers, while Hispanics comprise 16% of the U.S. workforce but only 7% of all STEM workers. And among employed adults with a bachelor's degree or higher, blacks are just 7% and Hispanics are 6% of the STEM workforce. Asians are overrepresented in the STEM workforce, relative to their overall share of the workforce, especially among college-educated workers: 17% of college-educated STEM workers are Asian, compared with 10% of all workers with a college degree. The representation of women, blacks and Hispanics holds pocketbook implications for workers. STEM jobs have relatively high earnings compared with many non-STEM jobs, and the earnings gap persists even after controlling for educational attainment. Among workers with similar education, STEM workers earn significantly more, on average, than non-STEM workers. In spite of the earnings advantage that STEM workers have over non-STEM workers, the gender wage gap is wider in STEM occupations than in non-STEM jobs. This is partially because women are clustered in lower-paying STEM jobs in the health care industry and underrepresented in the more lucrative fields of engineering and computer science. The pattern is similar for blacks and Hispanics, who also tend to be concentrated in less lucrative STEM jobs, widening the measured earnings disparity. One potential barrier for those wishing to enter the STEM workforce is the generally higher level of educational attainment required for such positions. Among college-educated workers, one-inthree (33%) majored in a STEM field. But only about half (52%) of those with college training in a STEM field are currently employed in a STEM job. The reasons about half of college-educated workers with STEM-related training turn to jobs elsewhere are likely complicated. Some may have found their skills and training to be applicable to and rewarded in a non-STEM occupation (such as banking or finance). But for others, there may be barriers to entry into STEM jobs in addition to obtaining a bachelor's degree in a STEM field. Even so, among college-educated workers, women who majored in computer science or related computer fields are less likely than men trained in those fields to be working in computer jobs. Similarly, women who majored in engineering are less likely than men to be working in engineering jobs. Thus, in two occupational clusters with particularly low shares of women, retention of those who appear to meet a key requirement for job entry appears to be lower for women than for men."}, {"section_title": "Defining STEM workers with a wide-angle lens", "text": "This analysis uses a broad definition of the STEM workforce and is based solely on occupation, as classified in the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey. As defined, here, the STEM workforce includes 74 occupations including computer and mathematical occupations, engineers and architects, physical scientists, life scientists, and health-related jobs such as healthcare practitioners and technicians (but not health care support workers such as nursing aides and medical assistants). As such, it includes workers with associate degrees and other credentials as well as those with bachelor's and advanced degrees. There is no standard definition of STEM workers. Other analyses of STEM workers include somewhat different occupations (see, for example, the Economics and Statistics Administration of the U.S. Department of Commerce). The National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics focuses on those with a college degree or more education in their surveys; UNESCO studies on global diversity issues in STEM focus even more narrowly on researchers with advanced degrees working in STEM. Including healthcare practitioners and technicians as STEM occupations has broad ramifications for the key findings. There are 9.0 million health-related jobs, comprising 52% of the STEM workforce. Healthcare practitioners and technicians are largely women, thus their inclusion boosts the overall representation of women in the STEM workforce. These health-related occupations also have somewhat larger shares of black workers and smaller shares of Asian workers compared with other STEM occupations, which affects the racial and ethnic composition of the overall STEM workforce. Among college-educated workers who majored in a STEM field during their undergraduate education, those who majored in health professions are significantly more likely to work in a STEM occupation, so their inclusion increases figures on the retention of STEM-trained workers. Social scientists are not included as a STEM occupation in this study, although other studies sometimes classify social sciences as a STEM job. As a practical matter, doing so makes little difference in the overall portrait of the STEM workforce because less than 1% of the workforce (about 280,000 workers in 2016) are classified as social scientists based on the Standard Occupational Classification system. See the sidebar on page 33 for more on the characteristics of social scientists in the workforce. The Census data used do not identify the subject matter expertise for postsecondary teachers, therefore, these workers are not included in the STEM workforce. As a practical matter, this omission does not appear to change the overall portrait of STEM workers, as others estimate that only 1% of those who majored in a STEM field are in academic jobs in colleges and universities. See the Appendix for characteristics of those in postsecondary teaching occupations. Growth of employment in STEM has markedly outpaced the growth of overall employment. Since 1990 STEM employment has grown 79% (from 9.7 million to 17.3 million), whereas overall employment grew only 34%. Some STEM occupations have grown more than others. Driven by the proliferation of information technology industries and the growth of the health care sector, computer workers have more than quadrupled since 1990 (a 338% increase) and healthcare practitioners and technicians have nearly doubled (a 92% increase). Employment of engineers and architects has grown only 16%, while employment of physical scientists has fallen by 46% from the 1990 level (from 1.1 million in 1990 to 0.6 million today) and math jobs have fallen by 24% 16 There is a small, statistically significant difference between these groups with 66.5% of those in STEM jobs working in private industry compared with 65.9% of those in non-STEM jobs. 17 The National Science Foundation's Science and Engineering Indicators 2016 (chapter 3, appendix table 3-5) also finds that the private industry is by far the largest employer of the college-educated workforce of scientists and engineers. However, those with Ph.D.'s in a science and engineering field (including the social sciences) are most likely to be employed in four-year educational institutions (42%) and private industries (34%), followed by government (9%). "}, {"section_title": "Engineering", "text": "Although women have made gains in representation in the STEM workforce over the past roughly 25 years, particularly in life and physical science jobs, they remain strongly underrepresented in some STEM job clusters, notably computer jobs and engineering. Racial and ethnic diversity in STEM is also varied. Black and Hispanic workers remain underrepresented overall; these groups are also underrepresented among those in STEM jobs with professional or doctoral degrees. 18 Asians are overrepresented across all STEM occupational clusters and have an especially large presence in the college-educated STEM workforce, particularly in computer occupations, relative to their share among employed college graduates overall. Women overrepresented in healthcare professions, underrepresented in engineering and computer science Women comprise 47% of all employed adults today, up modestly from 45% in 1990, and they make up half (50%) of all employed adults in STEM jobs in the U.S. The share of women in STEM overall is driven in large part by women's overrepresentation in healthrelated jobs, the largest STEM occupational cluster. Three-quarters (75%) of healthcare practitioners and technicians are women. 18 Blacks and Hispanics are also underrepresented in non-STEM jobs with professional or doctoral degrees. Women's representation in computer jobs has declined since 1990 Women's representation in STEM occupations varies substantially by occupational subgroup. Engineering occupations have the lowest share of women at 14%. Computer occupations follow, with women comprising a quarter of workers (25%) in these fields. Women are underrepresented among physical scientists (39%), but their representation among life scientists (47%) and math workers (46%) roughly equals women's overall share in the workforce (47%). Since 1990 women have made large gains in some STEM occupations, but in others growth has been far slower or has even reversed. In fact, the share of women has decreased in one of the highest-paying and fastest-growing STEM clusters -computer occupations. In 2016, 25% of workers in these occupations were women, down from 32% in 1990. At the same time, growth in women's representation in engineering has been incremental at best, increasing only slightly from 12% in 1990 and 2000 to 14% today. Women's shares among life and physical scientists, however, climbed markedly over this period (13 and 17 percentage points, respectively). Women's representation among the collegeeducated STEM workforce depends, in part, on women completing college training in STEM fields. Among college-educated workers, the share of women earning a STEM degree varies widely and generally corresponds with the share of women in these occupational clusters. Among all collegeeducated workers who majored in a health professions field, 81% are female. But just 16% of college-educated workers who majored in engineering are women. Within occupational subgroups, there is often broad variation among occupations in their share of women. The report's Appendix presents the share of women and total number of workers in specific STEM occupations. Mechanical engineering and electrical engineering have some of the lowest shares of women of any engineering occupation, or any STEM occupation (8% and 9%, respectively Professional/ doctoral degree environmental engineering, architecture and industrial engineering have somewhat larger shares of women (29%, 26% and 21%, respectively). Similarly, levels of women's representation vary enormously among health-related occupations. About nine-in-ten nurses (89%) and virtually all dental hygienists (95%) are women. 19 Women's representation among the ranks of physicians and surgeons is up from 20% in 1990 and 26% in 2000, coinciding with women's increases in medical school enrollment and graduation over this period. But, just 36% of physicians and surgeons today and 30% of dentists are women despite notable gains over time. For their part, men who work in STEM occupations are concentrated in computer occupations followed by engineering and health-related occupations. Among male STEM workers, 38% work in computer jobs and 27% each work in engineering/architecture and health-related jobs. Women in STEM jobs are concentrated in health-related occupations; 77% of female STEM workers are employed as healthcare practitioners and technicians. On average, women's representation in STEM jobs is lower among those employed with advanced degrees. For example, among all STEM workers holding a professional or doctoral degree, about four-in-ten are women (41%), compared with about six-in-ten (59%) STEM workers holding an 19 The figure for nurses combines registered, licensed practical and licensed vocational nurses. Biggest gains for women in STEM jobs among those with advanced degrees % of those employed in science, technology, engineering and math jobs who are women by highest level of education This pattern generally holds within occupational clusters as well. Among healthcare practitioners and technicians with a master's degree or less, roughly eight-in-ten are women. By contrast, among healthrelated workers with a professional or doctoral degree, 45% are women. See Appendix for details by occupation. At the same time, the biggest growth in women's representation since 1990 has been among STEM workers with advanced degrees, doctoral degrees in particular; this aligns with women's broader gains in educational attainment during this period. The share of women among doctoral or professional degree holders in the overall STEM workforce has climbed from 27% in 1990 to 41% today. The share of women among STEM workers with a bachelor's degree (but no advanced degree) has ticked up from 43% in 1990 to 47%, on par with the overall share of women in the workforce (47%). Social sciences are a popular college major but comprise a small occupational group About 5.8 million (or 12%) of today's college-educated workers majored in the social sciences. Psychology majors comprise the single largest group of those who majored in a social science field (35%). The next most popular social science majors are political science (19%) and economics (16%). Very few workers (3%) who majored in the social sciences are employed as social scientists (based on the Standard Occupational Classification system). The majority work in the cluster of social services, legal and education (30%) or in management, business and finance occupations (26%). Another 12% of social science majors are employed in a STEM occupation. Those in social science occupations are far more likely to be college-educated than workers in other occupational clusters: 97% of those in social science jobs have completed at least a bachelor's degree, and 82% have finished an advanced degree (a third hold a doctoral degree). Of the roughly 280,000 workers employed as social scientists in 2016, 80% were white, 8% were Hispanic, 5% were black and 5% were Asian. Women currently make up 63% of social scientists, up from 54% in 2000 and 50% in 1990. Among collegeeducated workers who majored in the social sciences, 54% are women. www.pewresearch.org Hispanics and blacks are underrepresented, Asians and whites are overrepresented in most STEM occupations The majority of STEM workers in the U.S. are white (69%), followed by Asians (13%), blacks (9%) and Hispanics (7%). Compared with their shares in the overall workforce whites and Asians are overrepresented; blacks and Hispanics are underrepresented in the STEM workforce as a whole. Over the past 25 years the STEM workforce has become more racially and ethnically diverse, echoing increasing diversity in the workforce during that period. In 1990, 83% of STEM workers were white, 6% were Asian, 7% were black and 4% were Hispanic. Within occupational clusters, the share of workers who are black or Hispanic varies widely (see Appendix Whites are overrepresented among STEM workers relative to their share in the total workforce. Asians (including both men and women) are also overrepresented among STEM workers compared with their share in the total workforce, particularly among STEM workers with a postgraduate degree. For details, see Appendix. Asians are overrepresented across all STEM occupational groups with higher than average shares among computer workers and life scientists, accounting for 19% of workers in both of these fields, which is much higher than their share in the workforce overall (6%). The share of Asians in STEM jobs varies substantially within occupational groups, however. For example, in engineering jobs the share of Asians ranges from 30% among computer hardware engineers to 2% among surveying and mapping technicians. Among healthcare practitioners and technicians, about one-in-five physicians and surgeons (21%) are Asian. But Asians comprise a far smaller share of veterinarians (3%) and emergency medical technicians and paramedics (2%). About one-in-five (19%) STEM workers in the U.S. are foreign born, broadly similar to the share in the overall workforce (18%). The vast majority of the Asian STEM workforce is foreign born (82%) as is the Asian workforce overall in the U.S. (81%). Black STEM workers, however, are more likely to be foreign born than black workers overall (22% vs. 14%). Hispanics working in STEM jobs are far less likely than those in the workforce overall to be foreign born (32% of Hispanic STEM workers are foreign born, compared with 54% of all employed Hispanics ages 25 and older). The typical STEM worker earns significantly more, on average, than the typical worker in a non-STEM occupation, and the earnings gap has been widening since 1990. The wage gap between STEM and non-STEM workers persists even when controlling for educational attainment. Among full-time, year-round workers ages 25 and older, median earnings for STEM occupations were $71,000 in 2016. 21 Comparable earnings for non-STEM workers were $43,000. Thus, STEM workers typically earn about two-thirds more than those in non-STEM jobs. 22 After adjusting for inflation, the typical earnings of STEM workers have increased since 1990, while earnings among non-STEM workers have been relatively flat. 23 Earnings vary significantly among STEM workers. Computer workers, mathematical workers and engineers/architects have median earnings between $81,100 and $83,000. In contrast, full-time, year-round healthcare practitioners and technicians have the lowest median earnings at $61,000. 21 Following Census Bureau practice, the earnings of full-time, year-round workers with positive earnings are reported. 22 Using a narrower definition of the STEM workforce, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics found that the mean wages of STEM workers were nearly double those of non-STEM workers. 23 The Economics and Statistics Administration of the U.S. Department of Commerce estimated the STEM earnings premium controlling for other factors influencing wages and finds that the premium has increased since the mid-1990s. The typical STEM worker now earns twothirds more than non-STEM workers Even among workers with similar levels of education, STEM workers earn significantly more than non-STEM workers. For example, among those with some college education (including those with an associate but not a bachelor's degree), the typical full-time, year-round STEM worker earns $54,745. A similar non-STEM worker earns $40,505, 26% less. Women in STEM occupations tend to be paid less than men working in STEM. Median earnings for full-time, year-round women working in a STEM job were $60,828 in 2016 -72% as much as the median earnings of men working in STEM occupations ($84,000). The earnings gap between women and men is larger in the STEM workforce than it is among non-STEM occupations. Among non-STEM workers, women's median earnings are 79% of men's earnings. In spite of the larger gender pay disparity among STEM workers, women working in STEM tend to be paid significantly more than women working in non-STEM occupations overall. The median earnings for women working full-time, year-round in non-STEM occupations are only $38,480. STEM workers tend to earn more than similarly educated non-STEM workers The 72% gender earnings gap overall partly reflects that men and women in the STEM workforce tend to work in different occupational subgroups. Compared with women, a higher share of men in STEM jobs are in higher-paying computer or engineering/architecture jobs. Women are more likely than men to be in lower-paying healthcare practitioner and technician positions. 24 Among full-time, year-round workers, the gender earnings gap varies across specific STEM occupational subgroups. For example, among computer workers, the typical woman earns 87% as much as the typical man. Among engineers and architects the gender earnings gap is 83%. However, the gender earnings gap among healthcare practitioners and technicians is 74%. 25 The overall gender earnings gap in the STEM workforce has not changed over the past 25 years. In 1990 the median earnings of women in STEM was 72% of the median earnings of men in STEM. The gender pay gap is widest for STEM workers with professional or doctoral degrees (women's median annual pay is 73% of men's) and those with high school or less education (66%). 24 The overall 72% gender earnings gap includes workers of all education levels. Among college graduates in the STEM workforce who majored in STEM, the gender earnings gap is 75%. This is similar to the 72% gap reported in a 2017 study by Kahn and Ginther for the National Bureau of Economic Research. 25 The larger gender wage gap among healthcare practitioners and technicians largely reflects the fact that men are overrepresented in the highest-paying occupations in this cluster of jobs. For example, men account for 64% of physicians and surgeons and 70% of dentists."}, {"section_title": "The gender earnings gap varies across STEM occupations and education", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Median annual earnings of women as a percent of men's earnings", "text": "Note: Based on adults ages 25 and older employed full-time, yearround with positive earnings. Some college includes those with an associate degree and those who attended college but did not obtain a degree. "}, {"section_title": "Racial earnings gaps are substantial but narrow among similarly educated and trained STEM workers", "text": "The median earnings of blacks ($58,000) and Hispanics ($60,758) working in STEM occupations are less than those of whites ($71,897) and Asians ($90,000) in the STEM workforce. The black to white earnings gap among STEM workers, while substantial, is smaller than the racial earnings gap among the non-STEM workforce. The typical black STEM worker earns 81% as much as the typical white STEM worker; blacks in non-STEM occupations earn 73% as much as their white counterparts. 26 Similarly, the earnings disparity between Hispanic and white STEM workers (85%) is narrower than among non-STEM workers (67%). In the STEM workforce, the typical Asian is paid substantially more than their white counterparts (125%) although Asians working in non-STEM occupations tend be paid less than whites (90%). As shown later in this chapter, this pay advantage narrows considerably once STEM-training is taken into account. Across all of these racial and ethnic groups, women earn less than their male counterparts (see Appendix). Racial earnings gaps narrower in the STEM workforce than non-STEM workforce Among workers ages 25 and older with at least a bachelor's degree, one-in-three (33%) has an undergraduate degree in a STEM major field of study. 28 The largest STEM-educated group is those who majored in engineering at 4.7 million workers. Some 3.9 million collegeeducated workers have health professions degrees, while 3.1 million have degrees in life or biological sciences. Fewer majored in computer science or related fields (1.8 million) or physical or earth sciences (1.7 million). Not all of these STEM-trained workers are employed in a STEM occupation, however. In fact, only about half of them are (52%). The rest are working in other fields with many still benefitting from the financial bump that comes with a STEM degree. 29 28 Findings concerning field of degree presented in this chapter focus only on the college-educated workforce or workers who have completed at least a bachelor's degree. The Census Bureau only collects information on the major field of study for those who completed at least a bachelor's degree. The major field of study refers to the undergraduate degree. The field of study for master's, professional and doctorate degrees is not collected. For respondents who hold a bachelor's degree in more than one field, the Census Bureau data include both the first and second fields listed. We classify college majors as STEM if either the first or second field of study is computers, mathematics and statistics; engineering; biological, agricultural and environmental sciences; physical and earth sciences; or health-related. The National Science Foundation's Science and Engineering Indicators 2016, chapter 3, reports that about 75% of adults with at least one degree in a science and engineering field also have their highest degree in a science and engineering field. Also see the Scientists and Engineers Statistical Data System, which combines data from the Survey of Doctorate Recipients with the National Survey of College Graduates. 29 Estimates of how many of the STEM-trained workers are \"retained\" in a STEM job vary across studies because of different definitions of what constitutes STEM training and a STEM occupation as well as whether such calculations are looking for a specific match between training fields and jobs or a more general link between training and employment in a STEM field. See Science and Engineering Indicators 2016, chapter 3, Figure 3-7. Also see Landivar, Liana Christin. 2013. \"Disparities in STEM Employment by Sex, Race, and Hispanic Origin: American Community Survey reports.\" U.S. Census Bureau, Table 7. Across occupational categories -STEM and non-STEM alike -STEM-trained workers earn more, on average, than those with a degree in a non-STEM field of study. Among collegeeducated workers employed full-time and year-round, the median earnings for those who have a STEM college degree are $81,011, compared with $60,828 for other college degrees. The earnings advantage for STEM training is apparent across all STEM job clusters, except for those in life science jobs. The earnings advantage for those who majored in a STEM field extends to workers outside of STEM occupations. Among all non-STEM workers, those who have a STEM college degree earn, on average, about $71,000; workers with a non-STEM degree working outside of STEM earn roughly $11,000 less annually. The reasons behind this pay advantage are not wholly clear; in addition to the knowledge base and skills learned in a STEM degree, some have argued that the persistence and aptitudes needed to complete a STEM degree may be valued by employers outside the STEM workforce. Among college graduates trained in STEM but employed in a non-STEM occupation, the most prevalent occupation is the management, business and finance cluster (17% of those with STEM training are employed in these fields). These jobs are particularly attractive to college graduates STEM college majors tend to earn more than non-STEM college majors  Gender differences in college-level STEM training and retention in STEM occupations Overall, among adults who majored in STEM, women are more likely than men to work in a STEM occupation (56% vs. 49%). 32 This difference is driven mainly by college graduates with a health professions degree, most of whom are women. About seven-in-ten (69%) women who majored in a health professions field are working in a health-related occupation, as are 61% of men who majored in a health professions field. (Of those who majored in a life sciences field, 30% of men and 33% of women work in a healthrelated occupation.) Among college-educated workers with training in other STEM fields, however, men are often more likely than women to be working in jobs directly related to their major field of study. For example, 38% of women and 53% of men who majored in computers or computer science are employed in a computer occupation. Women with a college degree in engineering are less likely than men who majored in these fields to be working in an engineering job (24% vs. 30%). The differential retention rates of Women with college degrees in computers and engineering are less likely than men to be working in those jobs women in computer and engineering occupations is in keeping with other studies showing a \"leaky pipeline\" for women in STEM. See Appendix for details. 2. Most Americans believe STEM jobs pay better, but few see them as offering more flexibility for family time Americans have mixed views of how careers in science, technology, engineering and math compare to jobs in other industries. About half or more of the general public -whether they are employed in STEM or non-STEM jobs -believe that STEM jobs pay better, attract more of the brightest young people and are more well-respected. But roughly half of Americans say these jobs are difficult to get into, while only 18% believe careers in STEM have more flexibility for balancing work and family than jobs in other industries. That flexibility is an important factor in choosing a job for both men and women in STEM, as well as those working in other areas. For the most part, men and women in STEM look for similar job qualities; one notable exception is that 59% of women tend to value jobs that help others, compared with 31% of men. Interviews with people working in STEM fields highlight the sometimes subtle ways that women feel they are treated differently at work. 33 The Pew Research Center survey finds overall, men and women in STEM see behaviors that help or hurt them to get ahead in the workplace somewhat differently. Men in STEM jobs see more advantage in working harder than others, being assertive, and being vocal about their accomplishments at work. Among women, those who work in majority-male settings are more likely than other women in STEM occupations to think these behaviors help them get ahead in their job. And, women in majority-male work settings are particularly likely to say they need to prove themselves at least some of the time at work in order to be respected by their coworkers. Majorities of Americans see jobs in STEM as better compensated or better at attracting young talent compared with other industry sectors About seven-in-ten Americans (71%) believe that jobs in STEM have higher salaries than those in other fields. More broadly, though, Americans have mixed views of how careers in STEM stand up against other sectors. Some 58% of U.S. adults say that jobs in STEM attract more of \"the brightest and most qualified young people.\" And half of Americans (50%) say that careers in STEM \"offer more opportunities for advancement,\" a similar share (49%) believe that STEM jobs are more difficult to get into. www.pewresearch.org While 45% of respondents say that STEM positions offer an opportunity to \"make a more meaningful contribution to society,\" 28% say that STEM jobs are \"more focused on helping others\" than jobs in other industries. And, 18% say that STEM jobs offer more flexibility than non-STEM jobs to balance work and family needs. Some 52% of U.S. adults consider jobs in STEM to have roughly the same amount of flexibility as other jobs and 28% say STEM jobs have less flexibility to balance work and family needs than those in other industries. Perceptions of STEM jobs are generally similar among U.S. adults working in STEM positions and those in other kinds of jobs. And, men and women working in STEM jobs tend to hold similar perceptions of how such positions compare with other industries. Among the differences, men are more inclined than women to see jobs in STEM as having comparatively more flexibility to balance work and family needs (28% vs. 17%). See Appendix for details. Most men and women in STEM jobs say flexibility to balance work and family is important to them in choosing a job About seven-in-ten (68%) employed U.S. adults say that having the flexibility to balance their work and family obligations is an important factor in choosing a job. Indeed, some 38% ranked it as the most important, more than any other characteristic considered in the survey. In all, 53% of employed adults say \"having opportunities for promotion or advancement\" is important to them, followed by \"having a high-paying job\" and \"being in a workplace that is welcoming for people like me\" (46% each). Men (71%) and women (76%) in STEM careers largely agree that being able to balance work and family is important to them in choosing a job. However, their views are somewhat different on other priorities. For instance, 57% of male STEM workers say that having opportunities for promotion is important compared with 46% of female STEM workers. And, while around six-in-ten men (59%) say that having a high-paying job is important, about half (48%) of women say the same. Men and women in STEM tend to look for similar job qualities, but more women value jobs that help others % of those in science, technology, engineering and math jobs who say each of the following is important to them personally when choosing a job Note: Respondents who did not consider each important or who did not give an answer are not shown.

See Appendix for details. Most people working in STEM jobs say working harder than others (67%), having a workplace mentor (66%) and being assertive (61%) help them get ahead at work.  prospects (33% vs. 25%). And, about a third (32%) of women in STEM jobs say talking about their personal life at work hurts their efforts to get ahead, compared with one-in-four (25%) men in STEM jobs who say the same. Among those in non-STEM jobs, women and men tend to be in agreement about which behaviors are most likely to improve their chances of advancing in their positions -including the belief that they need to work harder than others (64% vs. 65%) and be assertive (both 59%). For details, see Appendix. There are also differences by race and ethnicity on some of these measures. Notably, 47% of blacks employed in STEM say that talking about their personal life at work hurts their chances for advancement; smaller shares of white (27%) and Asian (24%) STEM workers say the same. Asians in STEM jobs are particularly likely to see being vocal about their work and accomplishments as an advantage (57%), compared with white (35%) and Hispanic (42%) STEM workers. A sizable share of all of these racial and ethnic groups of STEM workers agree that working harder than others and having a workplace mentor generally helps their chances of getting ahead. All the time Some of the time Not too often/never Men and women in STEM jobs are about equally likely to report feeling valued by their supervisor and coworkers Some qualitative reports of women and racial/ethnic minorities working in STEM positions have suggested that implicit bias in the workplace can leave such workers feeling less appreciated at work. 35 The Pew Research Center survey finds, however, few differences by gender or race/ethnicity in how much workers report feeling valued by their supervisor or their coworkers. Overall, most workers -both STEM and non-STEM -say their contributions are valued by their co-workers and by their supervisor at least some. Men and women in STEM jobs are about equally likely to say this. When asked, \"How often, if ever, do you feel the need to prove yourself at work in order to be respected by your coworkers?,\" 17% of employed U.S. adults say \"all the time,\" another one-third (33%) say some of the time and four-in-ten (40%) say either never or not too often. Women and men in STEM jobs are about equally likely to feel the need to prove themselves \"all the time\" (15% and 16%, respectively) in order to be respected by their coworkers. But, as will be discussed later in this chapter, the sense of having to prove oneself varies among women working in STEM jobs depending on the gender mix where they work. Beliefs about the kinds of behaviors that help employees succeed at work tend to vary among female STEM workers, depending on the gender context where they work. There are some modest differences in beliefs about these issues among women in STEM jobs depending on their level of education as well. The roughly one-in-five women (19%) in STEM jobs who work in majority-male workplaces stand out in how they assess the behaviors needed to get ahead. These women are particularly likely to say that being assertive (70%) helps their chances of getting ahead. Smaller shares of women working with mostly women or in evenly mixed gender settings think this helps their chances of advancement. Similarly, 54% of women in STEM jobs with majoritymale workplaces say that being vocal about their work and accomplishments helps their chances of advancing, compared with 31% of women working in majorityfemale settings. Women in STEM jobs in majority-male workplaces see the behaviors needed to get ahead differently Although, overall, women in STEM jobs are just as likely as men in such jobs to say they feel highly valued by supervisors and coworkers, women working in majority-male environments also say they have to work harder to earn that appreciation compared with women in either majorityfemale or evenly-mixed gender settings. When asked, \"How often, if ever, do you feel the need to prove yourself at work in order to be respected by your coworkers?,\" 79% of female STEM workers in majoritymale workplaces say \"all the time\" or \"some of the time,\" compared with 51% of women working in STEM jobs in mostly female workplaces and 54% among those in evenly mixed gender workplaces. There are only modest differences among men in STEM jobs by the gender makeup where they work; overall 56% of male STEM workers say they feel the need to prove themselves at least some of the time to earn the respect of their coworkers. For details, see Appendix. Women in STEM in majority-male workplaces feel the need to prove themselves more often to earn respect 3. Women in STEM see more gender disparities at work, especially those in computer jobs, majority-male workplaces There are wide gaps between men and women working in science, technology, engineering and math jobs when it comes to perceptions of fair treatment for women at work and experiences of workplace discrimination. Women in STEM jobs are much more likely than men in such jobs to say they have experienced discrimination at work because of their gender and to consider discrimination a major reason that more women are not working in STEM. While the majority of STEM workers say their gender has made no particular difference in their success, women in STEM jobs are more inclined than men to say their gender has made it harder for them to succeed at work. Those that feel this way raise a number of concerns including pay gaps and unequal treatment from their coworkers stemming from gender stereotypes. Experiences with workplace discrimination and concerns about gender inequities are more pronounced among women working in computer positions; among those working in workplaces where men outnumber women; and among women with advanced degrees, more of whom presumably work in higher level, professional positions compared with other women in STEM jobs. Although a higher share of women in STEM jobs say they have experienced at least one form of discrimination at work because of their gender, similar shares of women in STEM jobs and non-STEM jobs say they have personally experienced sexual harassment. Women in STEM jobs also tend to share similar perspectives with working women in non-STEM jobs when it comes to the value of gender diversity and the amount of attention paid to gender diversity at work. Most Americans value gender diversity at work; more than four-in-ten say diversity contributes to organizational success Americans are largely supportive of gender diversity in the workplace, with about half of U.S. adults (52%) characterizing it is as \"extremely\" or \"very\" important and 26% saying it is \"somewhat\" important. When asked to cite reasons for increasing gender diversity in the workplace, 46% of Americans say an important consideration is that gender diversity provides other perspectives that contribute to the overall success of companies and organizations. A similar share, 43%, cite giving people an equal opportunity to succeed as an important reason, while one-third (33%) say gender diversity makes good business sense because it increases the supply of potential workers. Americans' level of support for gender diversity depends, in part, on their own gender. Whereas more than half of women in STEM jobs and non-STEM jobs alike believe that such diversity is highly important (61% and 56%, respectively), fewer men in STEM and non-STEM jobs say the same (49% and 43%, respectively)."}, {"section_title": "Most", "text": "Support for gender diversity also depends, in part, on levels of education. Those who hold advanced degrees, whether they work in STEM or non-STEM jobs, express more support for the importance of gender diversity, on average. Around seven-in-ten (68%) employed adults believe their workplaces are giving sufficient attention to increasing gender diversity. Similar shares of women and men, in both STEM and non-STEM jobs, share that assessment. But two-in-ten women in STEM jobs (20%) and 15% of men in such jobs say there is too little attention to diversity where they work. Men in STEM jobs are about twice as likely to think there is too much attention given to gender diversity (13% vs. 5% of women in STEM jobs) in their workplace. On this issue, workers in non-STEM positions look similar to those in STEM, with men more likely than women to say there is too much attention to gender diversity but majorities of both genders say attention is sufficient. Women are more likely than men to see workplace gender diversity as important  About half of women in STEM consider discrimination a major factor behind women's limited representation in STEM occupations When asked to explain why there are not more women working in STEM jobs, a major reason, cited by around four-in-ten (44%) people in STEM jobs, is lack of encouragement for girls in these subjects from an early age. On this, men and women in STEM jobs tend to agree (43% of men and 45% of women in STEM jobs say this). However, women in STEM jobs are far more likely than their male counterparts to cite discrimination in hiring and promotions as a major reason why there are not more women working in STEM (48% vs. 29%). In addition, somewhat higher shares of female than male STEM workers cite the difficulty of balancing work and family in STEM jobs (40% vs. 28%), lack of belief among women that they can succeed (32% vs. 23%), the shortage of female role models in STEM (30% vs. 22%) and the slowness of the training \"pipeline\" (28% vs. 22%) as major reasons why there are not more women working in STEM fields. The one reason listed by larger shares of men than women is interest: about a quarter of men in STEM jobs (24%) say that a major reason there are not more women working in these positions is  that women are less interested than men in STEM. Just 15% of women with STEM jobs say the same. Half of women working in STEM say they have experienced gender discrimination at work; about a fifth have personally encountered sexual harassment Half (50%) of women in STEM jobs say that they have experienced at least one of eight forms of gender-related discrimination in the workplace, more than women in non-STEM jobs (41%) and far more than men in STEM positions (19%). The most common forms of gender discrimination reported by women in STEM jobs are earning less than a man doing the same job (29%), having someone treat them as if they are not competent because of their gender (29%), experiencing repeated, small slights in their workplace (20%), and receiving less support from senior leaders than a man who was doing the same job (18%). Previous Pew Research Center surveys have found more women than men report experiencing gender discrimination. The share reporting these experiences tends to vary depending on whether or not the questions are focused on the workplace, per se, and whether they rely on a summary judgment of experienced discrimination or ask separately about specific types of discriminatory behaviors.  In their workplace In their industry When it comes to the issue of sexual harassment in the workplace, workers are more likely to judge harassment as a problem in their industry than in their own workplace. Among all those working in a STEM job, 53% consider sexual harassment at least a small problem in their industry sector, compared with 32% who say the same about their own workplace. Women in STEM jobs are more likely than their male counterparts to say sexual harassment is at least a small problem in their workplace (36% vs. 28%) though similar shares say it is at least a small problem in their industry (55% vs. 50%). But, there are no gender differences among non-STEM workers about the degree to which sexual harassment is a problem. Some 36% each of men and women in non-STEM jobs consider sexual harassment to be at least a small problem where they work. Overall, 53% of STEM workers say sexual harassment is at least a small problem in their industry sector, compared with 46% of non-STEM workers. About a third of STEM workers (32%) and 36% of non-STEM workers say sexual harassment is at least a small problem where they work. More women than men in STEM jobs see sexual harassment as a problem in their workplace Women in STEM jobs are also about three times as likely as men in these jobs (22% vs. 7%) to say that they have experienced sexual harassment in the workplace. Similarly, working women in non-STEM occupations are more likely than their male counterparts to say they have experienced sexual harassment at work (22% and 7%, respectively). Workers who have experienced sexual harassment at work -whether men or women -are more likely to say that sexual harassment is a big problem in their workplace (22% do vs. 8% of those who have not been sexually harassed at work) and in the industry where they work (28% vs. 9%). These findings were gathered before the string of prominent sexual harassment allegations in Hollywood and beyond that sparked a public discussion of these issues, including the socialmedia-driven #MeToo movement. Perception of fair treatment for women in promotion opportunities differs by gender, and the gaps tend to be wider among those in STEM than non-STEM positions Overall, most workers in the U.S. believe that women are \"usually treated fairly\" where they work when it comes to recruitment and hiring (72%) as well as in opportunities for promotions and advancement (64%). Smaller shares say women are sometimes treated fairly and sometimes treated unfairly when it comes to hiring (21%) or opportunities for advancement (27%), while fewer than one-in-ten say that women are usually treated unfairly where they work during either process. Women in STEM positions are somewhat less likely than their male counterparts to consider women's treatment when it comes to opportunities for advancement as usually fair. Some 63% of women in STEM jobs say women are usually treated fairly where they work when it comes to promotion and advancement opportunities, compared with 78% of men in STEM jobs. There is a similar, though less pronounced, gender gap in perceptions of fair treatment in opportunities for promotion and advancement among non-STEM workers. Gender differences over perceived treatment of women in promotion opportunities at work In opportunities for promotion and advancement www.pewresearch.org One-in-five female STEM workers see their gender as a barrier to workplace success; this group raises a variety of concerns from inequalities in pay to evaluations of performance The majority of American workers say their gender has either made little difference (68%) or has made it easier to succeed in their job (17%), while 13% of workers say their gender has made it harder to succeed at work. More women (20%) than men (7%) in STEM positions believe their gender has made it hard for them to succeed at work. Majorities of both groups say gender has made no particular difference in their workplace success. On the flip side, a quarter (25%) of men and 8% of women in these jobs believe their gender has made it easier to succeed. In this regard, women in STEM share common ground with those in other occupations. Some 19% of women in non-STEM jobs say their gender has made it harder to succeed in their job, compared with 7% of men in non-STEM occupations. Most workers believe their gender has made little difference in success on the job STEM workers who said that their gender has made it harder to succeed in their job were asked to explain why they said this. The most commonly cited hardship due to gender involved barriers to hiring and promotions and lower pay, including being turned down for leadership positions and being passed over for the best opportunities in the workplace (22% of this group). Some examples of these concerns in their own words include: Another 14% of those working in STEM who say their gender has made it harder to succeed at work describe needing to work harder than others to achieve the same success. Some examples: \"A woman has to be significantly better at her job to be judged just as good. Among STEM workers who say that their gender has made it harder for them to succeed in their job, 13% say that they have been affected by reverse discrimination. Survey respondents in this group were exclusively men. Most in this group say that in they have been discriminated against in their workplaces in favor of hiring and promoting women: \"Today the white male is the enemy. I've seen too many qualified white males passed over for promotions or advancement in favor of a woman and/or minority. Qualifications don't matter these days, rather your gender and race matter.\" -White man, engineer, 47 \"In the tech industry, with so many males in engineering roles, males are treated unfairly when applying to other roles. Women are treated unfairly because they are promoted and selected \u2026 with less experience and less qualifications so that management (and the company) can be seen as 'diverse' at the expense of someone who has objectively more experience and qualifications who happens to be male for middle management and higher.\" -Asian man, software requirements engineering and management, 38 \"Women have less competition for advancement and are given preference over equally qualified men in an attempt to get a politically correct gender diversity.\" -Multiracial man, computer worker, 57 www.pewresearch.org On average, women working in STEM jobs are more likely to report experiences with and concerns about gender inequities in the workplace compared with men in these jobs. Among women in STEM, those working in computer positions, those in workplaces where men outnumber women, and those with advanced degrees are particularly likely to have concerns about gender equity and to have experienced gender discrimination. Roughly three-quarters (74%) of women in computer occupations say they have experienced gender discrimination at work, compared with 16% of men working in computer jobs. (Computer jobs include positions such as software development or data science, and include some who work in the technology industry and some who work in other sectors.) Women in computer jobs are more likely than women in STEM, overall, to say they have experienced discrimination (74% vs. 50%) and these women are particularly likely to report pay inequities (46% vs. 29% of all women in STEM) and 40% say have been treated as if they were not competent at work because of their gender (29% of all women in STEM jobs say this). Women in computer jobs are much more likely than men to report experiences with discrimination at work"}, {"section_title": "% of those in computer jobs who say the following", "text": "Note: Experience of gender-related discrimination based on combined responses to eight items.

There is widespread support among Americans -including those in STEM and non-STEM jobsfor the ideals of racial and ethnic diversity in the workplace. Among STEM workers, blacks stand out for their concerns that there is too little attention paid to increasing racial and ethnic diversity at work, their high rates of experience with workplace discrimination and their beliefs that blacks are not usually met with fair treatment in hiring decisions or in opportunities for promotion and advancement where they work. In this regard, blacks working in STEM jobs share common ground with Asians and, to a lesser degree, Hispanics who are all much less likely than whites in such jobs to believe that members of their own racial or ethnic group are usually treated fairly, particularly when it comes to opportunities for promotion and advancement. Most blacks in STEM positions consider major underlying reasons for the underrepresentation of blacks and Hispanics in science, technology, engineering and math occupations to be limited access to quality education, discrimination in recruitment and promotions and a lack of encouragement to pursue these jobs from an early age. A majority of Americans view racial and ethnic diversity in the workplace as important The American public not only places some level of importance on gender diversity in the workplace, but these views extend to racial and ethnic diversity, as well. Eight-in-ten Americans say it is at least somewhat important to have racial and ethnic diversity in today's workplaces, including around half who categorize this as \"extremely\" (26%) or \"very\" important (27%). By contrast, relatively few Americans view racial and ethnic diversity in today's workplaces as \"not too\" (9%) or \"not at all\" (9%) important. When asked which, if any, are important reasons for increasing racial and ethnic diversity in the workplace, 45% of U.S. adults say it provides other perspectives that contribute to the overall success of companies and organizations, while the same share say it gives people an equal opportunity to succeed. A smaller share (34%) say an important reason for creating more racially and ethnically diverse work environments is that it makes good business sense because it increases the supply of potential workers. Broad public support for racial and ethnic diversity in the workplace is in keeping with prior surveys on values related to diversity, more generally. For example, a 2017 Pew Research Center report found that a majority of Americans believe an increasing number of people from different races, ethnic groups and nationalities in the U.S. make the country a better place to live. Eight-in-ten Americans view racial and ethnic diversity in the workplace as at least somewhat important Blacks employed in STEM place a high level of importance on workplace diversity Majorities of white, black, Hispanic and Asian STEM employees view racial and ethnic diversity in the workplace as at least somewhat important, but there are wide racial and ethnic differences in the degree to which they consider it important. Blacks employed in STEM are far more likely than their white counterparts to say racial and ethnic diversity in the workplace is extremely or very important (84% vs. 49%, a difference of 35 percentage points). Sentiments on this issue among Hispanic and Asian STEM employees tend to fall in between these groups. On this measure, STEM workers look similar to those in other kinds of jobs. Blacks and Hispanics in non-STEM jobs, similarly, are more likely than are whites in such jobs to believe that racial and ethnic diversity at work is at least very important. Among STEM workers, blacks especially likely to view workplace diversity as important  Blacks in STEM are about four times as likely as whites in STEM to say their workplace doesn't pay enough attention to increasing racial and ethnic diversity When asked if they think their workplace pays too little, too much or just about the right amount of attention to increasing racial and ethnic diversity, about two-thirds (65%) of employed adults say their workplace is paying the right amount of attention, 22% believe there is too little focus, while 11% say too much attention is given to this issue. Black and white STEM employees rate their employers' commitment to this issue very differently. Roughly six-in-ten blacks (57%) working in a STEM job say their workplace pays too little attention to increasing racial and ethnic diversity. By comparison, just 15% of whites in this field say this. Majorities of whites, Hispanics and Asians working in STEM think their workplace pays about the right amount of attention to increasing racial and ethnic diversity. Whites working in STEM jobs hold similar views on this issue to whites in non-STEM jobs. But black STEM employees are more likely than blacks in non-STEM jobs to say their employer pays too little attention to increasing diversity (57% vs. 43%). The reverse is true for Hispanics: Those in STEM jobs are less likely than those who do not work in STEM to say their workplace is not paying enough attention to these issues (23% vs. 37%). About six-in-ten black STEM employees say there is too little attention given to increasing racial and ethnic diversity About half of STEM workers believe limited access to quality education is a major reason why blacks and Hispanics are underrepresented in STEM jobs Blacks and Hispanics made up around a quarter (27%) of the overall U.S. workforce as of 2016, but together they accounted for only 16% of those employed in a STEM occupation. Past studies have raised a number of possible reasons for this underrepresentation, including the need for racially and ethnically diverse mentors to attract more blacks and Hispanics to these jobs, limited access to advanced science courses, or socioeconomic factors that may disproportionally affect these communities. 36 When asked about the underlying reasons why blacks and Hispanics are underrepresented in this type of work, those working in STEM point to factors rooted in educational opportunities. Some 52% of those with a STEM job say a major reason for this underrepresentation is because blacks and Hispanics are less likely to have access to quality education that prepares them for these fields, while 45% attribute these disparities to these groups not being encouraged at an early age to pursue STEM-related subjects. 36 See MacPhee, David, Samantha Farro, Silvia Sara Canetto. 2013. \"Academic self-efficacy and performance of underrepresented STEM majors: Gender, ethnic, and social class patterns.\" Analyses of Social Issues and Public Policy. 13(1), 347-369.

A slight majority of STEM employees dismiss the idea that blacks and Hispanics are uninterested in these subjects: 54% say blacks and Hispanics being less interested in STEM is not at all a reason for the racial/ethnic employment gaps present in the field. There is wide disagreement across racial and ethnic groups on how much discrimination contributes to these racial/ethnic disparities. Among those in STEM, 72% of blacks say a major reason why blacks and Hispanics are underrepresented in these jobs is because they face discrimination in recruiting, hiring and promotions; by contrast only around a quarter of whites (27%) and Asians (28%) say this. Hispanic STEM employees fall in between these groups, with 43% citing this as a major reason for these disparities. Blacks in STEM are far more likely than other racial or ethnic groups to attribute this underrepresentation to lack of access to a quality education or lack of encouragement at an early age to pursue these subjects. Racial gaps on other items are far more modest. Among those in non-STEM jobs People who are employed in a STEM job are more likely than those working in non-STEM jobs to cite lack of access to quality education (52% vs. 42%), lack of encouragement to pursue subjects at an early age (45% vs. 40%), and lack of black and Hispanic role models working in the field (32% vs. 27%) as major reasons why these groups are underrepresented in STEM jobs. By about 20 percentage points, blacks in STEM are more likely than blacks in non-STEM jobs to think the lack of quality schooling and lack of encouragement to study these subjects are major reasons that blacks and Hispanics are not widely represented in STEM jobs. Blacks in STEM jobs are also more likely than those in non-STEM occupations to think discrimination is a major reason behind the underrepresentation of blacks and Hispanics (72% vs. 58%). Views among Hispanics on this tend to be similar across those working in STEM and non-STEM jobs.  One-in-five STEM workers who say their race has hampered their success point to treatment from coworkers as the reason The vast majority of white STEM workers say that their race or ethnicity has either made no difference to success (71%) or has made it easier to succeed in their job (22%), while 5% of white STEM workers say that their race or ethnicity has made success in their job harder. Blacks and Asians in STEM jobs, followed by Hispanics, are more likely than white STEM workers to say that their race or ethnicity has made it harder to find success in their job. In this, black and Hispanic STEM workers tend to hold similar views with blacks and Hispanics working in other kinds of occupations. A similar share of this group (9%) say they are held to different standards than their coworkers, leading them to need to work harder than others to achieve the same results. \"As an African American woman, I found that I have always had to work harder than others in the workplace. I am one of the few women that has been in the computer field for 30 years, which has always been mostly men.\" -Black woman, computer worker, 60 \"Feel like I have to constantly prove myself and jump through loopholes.\" -Asian woman, nurse, 38 About two-in-ten STEM workers (19%) who responded to this open-ended question said that their race has made success in their job harder because they feel that they face reverse discrimination. \"As a white male nothing is a given now, you have to fight harder to overcome institutional and government reverse discrimination.\" -White man, industrial and medical engineer, 55   Most STEM workers see fair treatment in hiring and promotion processes across race and ethnic groups, but there are wide disparities between whites in STEM jobs and others Overall, the majority of the public believes that different racial and ethnic groups are usually treated fairly in their own workplace in the recruitment and hiring process and in opportunities for promotion and advancement. On average, a larger share of STEM workers believe this is the case than do non-STEM workers. Among STEM workers, more say that whites are usually treated fairly in both the hiring and promotion processes in their own workplace than say the same for Asian Americans, Hispanics and blacks in each of these situations. There are sizable differences in perspective about this issue across racial and ethnic groups, however. About fourin-ten blacks in STEM jobs believe that blacks are generally treated fairly in recruitment (43%) or in advancement opportunities (37%). By contrast most white STEM workers believe that blacks are usually treated fairly in these processes (78% say this about hiring, 75% about advancement opportunities). Similarly, there are wide differences in perceptions of fair treatment between Asians and whites working in STEM jobs, particularly in terms of advancement opportunities. About half of Asians in STEM jobs (53%) say that Asian Americans are usually treated fairly in opportunities for promotion and advancement. In contrast, 79% of white STEM workers believe this usually occurs. Some 59% of Hispanics working in STEM jobs say that Hispanics are usually treated fairly when it comes to promotion and advancement opportunities; in contrast, most whites in STEM jobs (74%) believe Hispanics are usually treated fairly when it comes to promotions. On hiring processes, Hispanics and whites working in STEM jobs tend to agree that Hispanics are usually treated fairly (72% of Hispanics and 78% of whites in STEM jobs say this). For details, see Appendix. In their own words: Advice from women and minority groups about how to attract more people like themselves to jobs in STEM \"It needs to be emphasized as early as in elementary school so that the opportunities are considered as much of a viable career path as other vocations such as social work, teaching and nursing. Black women need to be invited into the classroom to speak to students so that the students know that there are others out there that are blazing the trails for them and that can encourage them in their academic and career pursuits.\" Black woman, engineer, 57 \"You must introduce those fields early in the elementary school years. Then continue to build on that by establishing STEM clubs and activities. Provide information to parents about local/community STEM events for continued interests. Most of all, make sure that any STEM student has the rigorous preparation that will be needed to get them accepted into college and able to handle the nature of the college level classes.\" Black woman, nurse, 49 \"Providing opportunities such as putting upgraded computers and/or science labs in inner-city schools, libraries and community centers. Black men currently in the STEM industries must be visible to the younger generation in order to show the value of those skills and the career implications.\" Black man, systems engineer, 30 \"By encouraging these fields in early education and making available mentors, tutoring and opportunities to experience various fields early on in education. Also when people, especially children, see themselves reflected in the world around them they tend to pursue various opportunities in education and employment as they become adults. Having a government that believes in science and technology and budgets monies (sic) to encourage growth and development in these fields.\" Hispanic woman, nurse, 68 \"This can be done by highlighting successful examples in these fields. Schools can introduce students with Asian background to former successful students from the same ethnicity.

Not just numbers and theory on paper and lecture.\" Hispanic man, respiratory therapist, 58 \"K-8 teaching needs to be designed to make these subjects more interesting and accessible to girls. Teachers need to be explicit about the need for more women in STEM jobs, and help girls feel that they have a reason to pursue these fields in spite of the somewhat intimidating gender breakdown of higher level classes.\" White woman, K-12 math teacher, 42 good job teaching reading, writing and math (73%) and preparing students for college (70%). Smaller majorities of parents say local schools do an excellent or good job preparing students for technical careers (63%) and teaching critical-thinking and problem-solving skills (58%). Fewer than half of the public consider STEM education in the U.S. to be at least above average when compared with other developed nations Americans are generally lackluster about the overall education provided by K-12 public schools in the U.S. compared with other developed nations -and they are similarly critical of education in STEM. Onequarter of Americans (25%) say K-12 STEM education in the U.S. is the best in the world or above average compared with other developed countries, 43% say it is average and three-in-ten (30%) consider it below average relative to other nations. Parents of students in public schools give similar ratings; some 26% say STEM education in the K-12 schools is at least above average compared with other countries. These relatively low ratings of STEM education for primary and secondary students are broadly in keeping with a 2015 Pew Research Center survey, which used slightly different wording. Americans give somewhat better reviews to U.S. STEM education at the undergraduate and graduate levels, though, here too, fewer than half say that undergraduate STEM education (35%) or graduate education (38%) outrank that available in other developed nations. People holding a postgraduate degree, whether in a STEM or non-STEM field, are among the most likely to give high marks to the quality of postsecondary education in the U.S. About six-in-ten (62%) of those with a postgraduate degree in a STEM field say graduate education in STEM is at least above average, compared with one-third (33%) of those with some college or less education. Similarly, about half of those with a postgraduate degree in a STEM field (52%) see collegelevel STEM education as above average or better, compared with other nations. In contrast, just 13% of those with a STEM postgraduate degree rate K-12 STEM education as above average and about half (51%) say the U.S. is below average in this regard. By comparison, 27% of adults with some college or less education give K-12 STEM education in the U.S. the same rating. The public sees a wide range of problems facing K-12 STEM education Americans spread the blame widely when it comes to problems with STEM education in K-12 public schools, with many seeing problems that originate from parents and students as well as teachers and school curricula. Most U.S. adults (61%) say it is a big problem for STEM education that parents are not involved in supporting schools. Similar shares say students' lack of work ethic (59%) and lack of interest in learning (57%) is a big problem for K-12 STEM education. Similar shares of parents with children in public schools see each of these as big problems for STEM education. In all, 55% of Americans see emphasis on prepping students for standardized state tests as a big Americans see range of problems in K-12 STEM education  problem, while some 53% fault teachers for not emphasizing the practical uses of these subjects. Roughly half of the public says a big problem for STEM education comes from teachers rarely using methods that help students think critically and problem solve (49%), spending too little time on these subjects in elementary school (48%) or not having up-to-date curriculum materials (48%). 38 Those who have a postgraduate degree in a STEM field tend to hold similar views about the problems facing K-12 STEM education. But, this group is especially likely to attribute flaws in such education to an underuse of teaching methods that promote critical thinking and problem solving (68% of those with a postgraduatelevel STEM degree say this). When asked in an open-ended format which subject schools should emphasize more today, 28% of adults named a STEM subject. Specifically, 18% mentioned math or statistics, 9% mentioned science or engineering, and 3% mentioned computers or computer science. Other subjects mentioned include English (19%) and 38 According to the 2012 National Survey of Science and Mathematics Education, a national survey of teachers conducted by Horizon Research, K-3 public school students spend an average of 19 minutes on science and 54 minutes on math per day; grades 4-6 spend 24 minutes on science, 61 minutes on math per day. About three-in-ten Americans say STEM subjects should be emphasized more in school % of U.S. adults who say K-12 public schools should emphasize ____ more than they do now Note: STEM subjects include math and statistics, science and engineering and computers and computer science.

Many Americans say they liked math and science in school, thought about a STEM career One of the first ways Americans encounter science, technology, engineering and math is through their early education. And many look back fondly at their science and math classes during this time in their lives. Three-quarters of Americans say they liked science classes in grades K-12, citing labs and activities as a key reason why. And, a smaller majority recalls liking math classes in grades K-12. STEM workers are more likely than those working in other fields to say they liked science or math classes in school, but still more than four-in-ten non-STEM workers say they liked both subjects in grades K-12. Many of those who work in occupations outside of STEM also say they were once interested in pursuing a job or career in STEM. Most of these non-STEM workers considered working in STEM while in school or in their 20s rather than later in life. The most common reasons these workers give for not pursuing a STEM job or career were cost and time barriers, such as the amount of money and the number of years required for specialized training. Three-quarters of Americans say they liked science classes in grades K-12, while only one-quarter say they disliked science classes. When forced to choose whether the subject matter or teaching was the main reason they liked science classes, most point to the subject matter. About twothirds (68%) say the subject matter was the main reason they liked science classes in grades K-12, while roughly three-in-ten (31%) say the main reason they liked science classes was the way they were taught. Similarly, among those who disliked science classes in grades K-12, more say the reason they disliked science classes was the subject matter than the way the classes were taught (61% vs. 36%). About four-in-ten STEM workers say they had an older family member in STEM Role models, often parents or other close family members, are considered by many to be important for career development. Overall, roughly four-in-ten STEM workers (41%) say at least one of their older, close family members works or worked in STEM. By comparison, 26% of those working in other occupations say they have or had an older family member working in a STEM job or career. Some 44% of women in STEM jobs and 37% of men say they have or had a close older family member working in STEM. The survey also asked respondents to select from a list of possible reasons for liking or disliking science classes. Among those who liked science classes, most enjoyed the labs and hands-on learning experiences (70%). Fewer say it was easy to see how science would be useful for the future (40%) or they found science classes easy (31%). Among those who disliked science classes, the most commonly selected reason is that they found science classes to be too hard (46%). Many say they disliked science classes because they did not see how science would be useful for the future (36%). Three-quarters of Americans say they liked K-12 science classes and that group especially favored the hands-on learning experiences"}, {"section_title": "% of U.S. adults who say they generally ___ in grades K-12", "text": "Note: Reasons for disliking/liking science classes based on those who say they generally disliked/liked science classes in grades K-12.

About one-in-ten (11%) say they liked math but not science, while a larger share (29%) disliked math but liked science. Some 14% say they disliked both math and science classes. Men are more likely than women to say they liked both math and science classes (54% vs. 39%). Women are slightly more inclined than men to say they liked only science classes (31% vs. 26%) or they disliked both (16% vs. 11%). Whites, blacks and Hispanics are about equally likely to say they liked both math and science classes in grades K-12. Similarly, there are no significant differences by age. Men are more likely than women to say they liked both math and science in grades K-12 As one might expect, working in STEM or earning a postgraduate degree in a STEM field is closely related to liking science and math classes in grades K-12, but many of those who work in other occupations or have a degree in a different field liked one or both of these subjects too. Two-thirds of STEM workers (66%) say they liked both math and science in grades K-12. Among non-STEM workers, 45% say they liked both, a much larger share than say they disliked both (16%). There are wide differences among those working in STEM, however. Engineers are among the most likely to say they liked both math and science classes in grades K-12 (86%). Health-related workers (53%) are only slightly more likely than non-STEM workers to say they liked both. About three-in-ten health-related workers (31%) say they liked science but disliked math. Similarly, about three-quarters of adults with a postgraduate degree in a STEM field (77%) say they liked both science and math classes in grades K-12. Among those holding a postgraduate degree in other fields, half say they liked both science and math classes. Among those in other types of jobs, four-in-ten were once at least somewhat interested in a STEM job or career Four-in-ten Americans who currently work in non-STEM occupations say that they were \"very\" (16%) or \"somewhat\" (24%) interested in pursuing a career in science, technology, engineering and math at some point. About half (48%) say they were not too interested (21%) or not interested at all (27%) in pursuing a job or career in STEM. Another roughly one-in-ten of this group (9%) say that their current job or career involves STEM. Many jobs and careers outside of STEM involve science, technology, engineering and math skills and knowledge. 39 Of those who say their current job involves STEM, about two-in-ten (18%) work in management, while about one-in-ten (12%) work in business and finance operations. Men working in a non-STEM occupation are a bit more likely to say that they were ever interested in pursuing a career in STEM (43% vs. 35% of women in non-STEM jobs). There are no more than modest differences among whites (37%), blacks (41%) and Hispanics (45%) on this measure. Those who have or had an older family member working in STEM are modestly more likely than those who didn't have an older family member in STEM to say they were once interested in a STEM job or career (48% vs. 36%). 40 39 For more see National Science Board. 2014. \"Revisiting the STEM Workforce: A Companion to Science and Engineering Indicators\" 40 There is considerable scholarship on the factors related to pursuing a STEM career.

Men working in non-STEM occupations are more likely to say they were ever interested in a STEM career When asked when in their life they were interested in pursuing a STEM job or career, most pointed to when they were in high school, college or during their 20s. About four-in-ten (41%) say that they had this interest in college or during their 20s and another 28% say they were interested in high school or their teenage years. Fewer say they were interested in pursuing a STEM career early in life, in elementary school or their childhood (10%) or later in life over the age of 30 (5%).

The margin of error for the full sample is plus or minus 2.7 percentage points. The survey was conducted by the GfK Group in English and Spanish using KnowledgePanel, its nationally representative online research panel. KnowledgePanel members are recruited through probability sampling methods and include those with internet access and those who did not have internet access at the time of their recruitment (KnowledgePanel provides internet access for those who do not have it and a device to access the internet when they join the panel, if needed). A combination of random-digit dialing (RDD) and address-based sampling (ABS) methodologies have been used to recruit panel members (in 2009 KnowledgePanel switched its sampling methodology for recruiting members from RDD to ABS). KnowledgePanel continually recruits new panel members throughout the year to offset panel attrition as people leave the panel. All active members of the GfK panel were eligible for inclusion in this study.

Thus, the survey design oversamples employed adults and those employed in a science, technology, engineering or math occupation. In all, 8,995 panelists were invited to take part in the survey. The completion rate for this survey, that is the share of panelists invited to participate who completed the survey, was 62.9%. The cumulative response rate, calculated following Callegaro and DiSogra 2008, was 5%. 41 All respondents were asked to verify their current employment status. Updated occupation information was collected for all employed adults who indicated that their main job had changed since the time of completing their profile survey. 42 Most respondents who said they worked in a STEM occupation were also asked an open-end question to describe their occupation in more detail. These responses were used for final classification as employed in a STEM or non-STEM job where they were available. 43 STEM occupations included the following job categories: computer and mathematical; architecture and engineering; life and physical sciences; medical doctors; other health care practitioners; health care technologists and technicians; and teachers (both K-12 and 41 See Callegaro, Mario and Charles DiSogra. 2008. \"Computing Response Metrics for Online Panels.\" Public Opinion Quarterly, 72 (5): 1008-1032. 42 Most respondents were first asked if their main job had changed since the time of completing a profile survey. If their job had changed, they were asked their occupation again. However, 388 panelists (8% of the total) were simply -asked the occupation question again with those more recent responses used to determine if they currently worked in a STEM or non-STEM job. 43 Panelists who were selected to participate as working in a STEM occupation who said their main job had changed and their new occupation was not in STEM were treated as ineligible for the survey. Panelists who were reclassified by researchers to a non-STEM occupation or not working based on their open-end response were treated as eligible for the survey though. Panelists who were selected to participate as working in a non-STEM occupation and those selected to participate from the general sample of panelists who were confirmed as currently working in a STEM job were treated as eligible for the survey and classified as working in a STEM job.

Note that since the survey was conducted in only English and Spanish, the sample of Asians working in STEM jobs are those with proficiency in English. There are not enough Asians working in non-STEM jobs for separate analysis in this survey. The data were weighted in a multistep process that begins with a base weight that accounts for differences in probability of selection into the study. Respondents were divided into four mutually exclusive subgroups 1) STEM workers, excluding STEM teachers 2) non-STEM workers, excluding non-STEM teachers 3) Teachers, both STEM and non-STEM 4) Non-workers. Each of these groups was separately weighted using an iterative technique to match population benchmarks. Next, the weighting combined all workers and aligned the combined group to population benchmarks for all workers. 45 In a final step, workers (both STEM and non-STEM) were combined with non-workers, and the weights were further adjusted so that each group's relative proportions and demographic profile matched estimates for all U.S. adults. At each stage, the resulting weights were trimmed and scaled to the number of completed surveys. Population benchmarks included: gender by age, race/ethnicity, education, household income, region by metropolitan status, and primary language. Primary language parameters come from the Census Bureau's 2015 American Community Survey; all other parameters come from the March 2016 Current Population Survey (CPS). Sampling errors and tests of statistical significance take into account the effect of weighting at each of these stages. The tables show the unweighted sample sizes and the error attributable to sampling that would be expected at the 95% confidence level. Sample sizes and sampling errors for other subgroups are available upon request. In addition to sampling error, one should bear in mind that question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of opinion polls.
