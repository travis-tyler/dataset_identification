Simultaneously, lower growth rates in the developed world have contributed to the relative increase in the elderly population. Thus, by 2030, there will be 71 million Americans aged 65 years or older accounting for approximately 20% of the US population. 1 Similarly, in the European Union, adults aged 60 years and more comprise 21% of the population and are projected to increase to 27% by 2022 and to 33% by 2050. 2 Similarly, there are 143 million people aged 60 years or older in China currently accounting for 11% of its population and this is projected to increase to an alarming 374 million by 2040 comprising 24.8% of the Chinese population. 3 This growing geriatric population has medical, social, and economic impacts that need to be addressed and studied.\nAn important geriatric medical issue with socioeconomic ramifications is that of aging-associated renal diseases. 4 According to the US Renal Data System, during 1995-2005, the adjusted point prevalence rates per million population of reported endstage renal disease increased from 70.5 to 82.1 (16% increase) in the age group 0-19 years, from 730.6 to 858.2 (17% increase) in the age group 20-44 years, from 2333.3 to 3150.4 (35% increase) in the age group 45-64 years, from 3627.5 to 5500.6 (51% increase) in the age group 65-74 years, and from 2762.4 to 4795.8 (73% increase) in the age group 75 \u00fe years. 5 The aging kidney may be affected by many diseases (Table 1) , none of which is specific to the elderly, although certain disorders may have an increased prevalence in the geriatric population (for example, renal disease secondary to type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and amyloidosis). 6 Despite the widespread use of the term 'arterionephrosclerosis of aging' by pathologists and clinicians to describe the pathological changes observed in the senescent kidney, it is not a well-defined entity because no specific morphological findings are pathognomonical for the aging kidney and, as such, aging kidney (arterionephrosclerosis of aging) is a diagnosis of exclusion. Therefore, renal pathologists and nephrologists need to rule out glomerular, tubulointerstitial, and vascular diseases before ascribing the morphological and functional changes to aging-related decline in renal function. The latter is the focus of this review."}, {"section_title": "FUNCTIONAL CHANGES OF THE AGING KIDNEY", "text": "Numerous reviews have addressed the functional changes associated with renal senescence. 7, 8 Although they are all interrelated, it is convenient to consider glomerular, tubular, and endocrine functions individually."}, {"section_title": "Glomerular function", "text": "It is believed that after the age of about 30 years, the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) begins to decline at an average rate of 1 ml per year, resulting in an inulin clearance of 65 ml/min at the age of 90 years. 9 However, this dogma has been challenged. In the Baltimore longitudinal study of aging among 254 'normal' subjects, although the mean decline in creatinine clearance (CrCl) was 0.75 ml/min/year, 36% of the subjects showed no aging-related decrease in CrCl, and a few of these subjects actually showed an increase in their CrCl. 10 This variability suggests that factors other than aging may be responsible for apparent reduction in renal function. For instance, increase in blood pressure (even still within the normotensive range) or low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol is associated with accelerated age-related loss of renal function. 10, 11 Conversely, in Bronx longitudinal aging study comprising 141 very elderly subjects, there was a small but significant decline in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine at 3 years, which persisted, although at a lower rate, at 6 years. This was associated with slight decrease in diastolic blood pressure. 12, 13 A similar pattern of decreasing blood urea nitrogen and creatinine was seen in the 31 subjects who entered the study with mild azotemia. The authors conclude that blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine do not necessarily increase with time in the old individuals, even in those with mild azotemia. They further noted that although renal function in the elderly does not improve with time, it may stabilize with satisfactory blood pressure control. Thus the decline in renal function with age, per se, may not be clinically significant unless it is superimposed by acute/chronic illnesses further compromising the renal function/renal reserve. As noted above, controversy persists as to whether the decline in GFR is an appropriate consequence of normal aging process or the result of the associated comorbidities. 6, 10, 11 Creatinine clearance is influenced by the nutritional status, protein intake, and muscle mass and is therefore not an accurate measure of the GFR in the elderly. 14 The creatinine production and the urinary creatinine output gradually decline in proportion to the aging-related decrease in muscle mass and body weight. Thus, plasma creatinine does not increase with increasing age, despite the agingrelated reduction in CrCl. 15 The true GFR, measured by inulin clearance, in the 'healthy' elderly subjects, although significantly lower than in the young, remains within the normal range and is underestimated by CrCl and even more so when calculated by the Cockroft-Gault (CG) forrmula. 16, 17 The Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study Group formula for calculating GFR is considered more accurate than the CG formula. 18, 19 Notably, neither CG nor MDRD equation has been validated in the population older than 70 years. In a study involving 100 individuals aged 65-111 years, GFR values calculated with the MDRD formula were much higher than that obtained with the CG equation. Additionally, the difference in GFR values between MDRD and CG increased dramatically with aging. Moreover, no correlation was observed between predicted values obtained with the two methods. Thus, the precision and accuracy of these formulas in estimating GFR in the elderly remain dubious. 20 Another study showed more than 60% 21 This has important implications, especially when calculating drug dosages in the elderly. Overestimation of GFR can inadvertently result in unexpected drug toxicity. It was thus recommended that the CG equation should be used in preference to MDRD equation to estimate GFR for drug dosage calculations in the elderly. 22 Serum cystatin C measurement, especially when compared with reference values adjusted for age, may be a promising index of renal insufficiency in the elderly. 23 Under normal conditions, renal vasodilation leads to a significant increase in the renal blood flow and GFR, representing renal hemodynamic and functional reserves. The increase in the renal plasma flow (RPF) and GFR in response to maximum renal vasodilation induced by concurrent infusion of amino acids and dopamine is markedly reduced in healthy elderly individuals. 24, 25 This phenomenon points to structural, rather than functional, changes such as imbalance between vasodilatory and vasoconstrictive influences in the aging kidneys. In a recent study, Ahmed et al. 26 have shown that the reduction in RPF induced by intravenous administration of the nitric oxide (NO) synthase (NOS) inhibitor, L-NAME (nitro-L-arginine methyl ester), increased markedly with aging in men but not women, indicating that the renal vasculature of men becomes more dependent on NO with age compared with that of women. Similarly, increasing plasma levels of endogenous NOS inhibitor, ADMA (asymmetric dimethylarginine), and associated NO deficiency are shown to contribute to the aging-related decline in RPF. 27 In addition, systemic ADMA infusion in healthy people significantly decreased effective RPF and increased renovascular resistance and mean arterial blood pressure. 28 The reduction in renal hemodynamic and functional reserves can compromise renal adaptation to acute ischemia and as such can heighten susceptibility to acute renal injury in the geriatric population."}, {"section_title": "Tubular function", "text": "Aging-related alteration in renal tubular function manifests in multiple ways. For instance, the reduction in urinary sodium excretion in response to dietary sodium chloride deprivation is significantly slowed down in the elderly as compared with young individuals. 29 This phenomenon accounts for the increased susceptibility of the elderly to volume depletion. On the other hand, under steady-state condition, the elderly as well as the young can maintain sodium balance. For instance, on a diet containing 4000 mg of sodium, there were no significant differences in the mean 24-h urinary sodium excretion and fractional excretion of sodium between the healthy young and the healthy elderly, the hypertensive elderly, and the elderly with compensated mild-to-moderate heart failure. Compared with the healthy young subjects, the mean lithium clearance, an indicator of proximal tubular function, was significantly lower in all three groups of elderly subjects. Accordingly, the fractional proximal sodium reabsorption was significantly higher in the elderly, but was offset by the lower distal fractional reabsorption of sodium. 30 The handling of potassium is negatively affected by aging, explaining the predisposition of the elderly to developing drug-induced hyperkalemia. The urine potassium is derived from active transtubular transport in the distal nephron and collecting duct, which is linked to the reabsorption of sodium across the aldosterone-modulated Na-K ATPase transporters. Thus, impaired potassium secretion (and the corresponding impaired sodium reabsorption) may occur because of tubular atrophy or tubulointerstitial scarring due to previous pyelonephritis or ongoing glomerulosclerosis; hyporeninemic or normoreninemic hypoaldosteronism; and decreased water and sodium delivery to the distal nephron due to dehydration and reduced intravascular volume. 31 The ability of the kidney to both maximally concentrate and dilute the urine also diminishes with age, 32, 33 explaining the higher rate of nocturia 34 and the predisposition to dehydration and hypernatremia as well as to hyponatremia if excess fluid is administered. 35 One of the major medical implications of aging is the heightened susceptibility to drug toxicity in the elderly population. 36 This, in part, is due to the altered drug pharmacokinetics that stems from a decline in the functional capacity of the kidney and most, if not all, other organs, as well as altered body composition (reduced water and increased fat), which accompanies advanced age. In this context, the reduction in excretory capacity of the kidney and, to a lesser extent, the decline in the hepatic metabolism contribute to the altered pharmacokinetics of many drugs in the elderly population. In addition, aging adversely affects pharmacodynamics of many drugs by modulating the sensitivity and physiological response to their actions irrespective of the change in their disposition. For instance, in the elderly, the central nervous system is highly vulnerable to drugs such as benzodiazepines, opioids, and psychotropic agents. On the other hand, the diminished sensitivity of the cardiovascular system to beta-adrenergic stimuli predisposes the elderly individuals who are treated with antihypertensive medications to orthostatic hypotension. The combination of altered pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics in the elderly patients with comorbid conditions requiring multiple medications presents an increasingly common and complex problem. Therefore, it is prudent to initiate therapy at the drug dosage with lowest effect and increase the dose slowly, if needed, in the older patient."}, {"section_title": "Endocrine function", "text": "The increase in the prevalence of anemia with decreasing renal function 37 may be related to the reduced erythropoietin (EPO) production by the kidney. 38 Although the serum EPO levels increase with age in healthy subjects, perhaps as a compensatory response to age-related subclinical blood loss, increased erythrocyte turnover, or increased EPO resistance, 39 the levels are unexpectedly lower in the anemic elderly compared with the anemic young, suggesting a blunted response to low hemoglobin. [40] [41] [42] Elderly women with osteoporosis and low CrCl (o60 ml/min) have lower calcium absorption, lower serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, and normal serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, suggesting a diminished conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D by the aging kidney. 43 A CrCl of less than 65 ml/min is reported to be an independent risk factor for falls and associated fractures in the elderly with osteoporosis, 44 and calcitriol therapy reduced the number of falls by 50%, possibly related to an increase in serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D in addition to an upregulation of vitamin D receptors in the muscle and an improvement in muscle strength. 43 Kidney is the major site of insulin clearance from the systemic circulation, 45 removing approximately 50% of insulin in the peripheral circulation. Insulin clearance by the kidney is accomplished by glomerular filtration and proximal tubular uptake and degradation. Consequently, the decline in renal function in the elderly leads to reduced insulin clearance. This is, in part, offset by diminished glucose tolerance, which appears to be due to defective insulin secretion and action with aging. It has been suggested that the impaired insulin secretion of aging rats may not be due to old age per se, but rather due to associated chronic renal insufficiency and excess of parathyroid hormone. 46 A recent study showed that insulin action, measured with either the meal or the intravenous glucose minimal models, was lower in the elderly than in the young participants, suggesting increased peripheral resistance to insulin in the elderly. 47 Insulin secretion was also impaired in the elderly individuals, indicating decreased b-cell secretory reserve. Thus, whereas total body insulin clearance is lower in the elderly than in the young subjects, geriatric patients are at a higher risk of glucose intolerance.\nThe kidneys also play a central role in sympathetic regulation. Sympathetic nervous system activity is elevated in patients with chronic kidney disease 48 and persists after transplantation. 49 It is possible that chronic activation of the sympathetic nervous system contributes to arterial stiffening in these patients with generally advanced arterial disease. Similar arterial stiffening is observed in the elderly and is associated with declining renal function. It is plausible that increased sympathetic tone caused by declining GFR and other factors contributes to vascular changes in the elderly."}, {"section_title": "STRUCTURAL CHANGES OF THE AGING KIDNEY", "text": "The gross appearance of granularity and pitting of the external surface of aging kidney is secondary to the underlying arterial disease, which leads to small regions of the outer renal cortex to undergo global glomerulosclerosis, tubular atrophy, and interstitial fibrosis (Figure 1 ). These features are best correlated with aging-related intimal fibrosis of the interlobular arteries (arterial sclerosis), a change that may be accelerated by hypertension and diabetes mellitus. 7, 50, 51 Arterial intimal fibrosis may be associated with medial thinning and is found uniformly in the older kidneys with or without underlying cardiovascular disease. The regional heterogeneity of the intimal thickening may account for the regional heterogeneity of the ischemic nephrons. The intimal hyperplasia in the interlobular arteries may allow for the transmission of the pulse wave abnormally into the smaller distal branches leading to arteriolar hyaline changes, which may then accelerate the proximal intimal fibrosis. [52] [53] [54] [55] The aging kidney also contains a high percentage of afferent and efferent arterioles that communicate directly with each other ('aglomerular arterioles') because of loss of their glomeruli, particularly in the juxtamedullary location. 51 The average kidney weight progressively declines after the fifth decade of life, with the renal cortex being affected more than the medulla. 8, 50 Consistent with the decrease in kidney weight and thinning of the cortical ribbon with increasing age, the glomeruli decrease in number with increase in age. [56] [57] [58] In addition, the percentage of glomeruli showing global glomerulosclerosis increases with age, and there are direct correlations between the number/percentage of globally sclerotic glomeruli and increasing age as well as between the number/percentage of globally sclerotic glomeruli and intrarenal arterial disease, particularly the outer cortical arterial disease. 59 Up to 10% of the glomeruli may be globally sclerotic in 'normal' subjects younger than 40 years. 60 It has been suggested that 'pathological' glomerulosclerosis should be seriously considered when the number of globally sclerosed glomeruli exceeds the number calculated by the formula: (patient's age/2)\u00c010 (see ref. 61 ). Equally important is the morphological evaluation of the globally sclerosed glomeruli. Thus, an infiltrative process such as amyloidosis or diabetes mellitus should be considered if a globally sclerosed glomerulus appears larger than usual. The diseases of renal arterial system should be excluded if an early-sclerosed glomerulus displays shrinkage of the glomerular tuft, wrinkling and thickening of the glomerular basement membrane, and collagen deposition internal to Bowman's capsule near the vascular hilum. 8 Sclerosed glomeruli with breaks in the glomerular basement membrane may be a sequela of severe glomerular inflammation and crescent formation and should alert one to the possibility of underlying IgA nephropathy, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis, or lupus nephritis, among others. 50 In addition, aging human kidney is associated with mesangial matrix expansion and thickening of the glomerular basement membrane, although not all agree with these findings. 50 These changes are nonspecific and may be seen in hypertension, diabetes, and many other renal disorders. Similarly, tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis may be aging-related or may occur due to chronic inflammation or vascular disease. 62 As 63, 64 and may promote bacterial growth and contribute to the frequent renal infections in the elderly."}, {"section_title": "PATHOGENESIS OF RENAL AGING", "text": "As described above, the major histological features of renal aging are glomerulosclerosis, tubular atrophy, interstitial fibrosis, and arterial intimal fibrosis. Although kidneys of the elderly are affected by diseases like hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and sporadic insults such as infections and drug injuries, it appears that renal aging occurs in the absence of systemic or local diseases, which can themselves accelerate the 'natural' process of aging. The pathogenesis of agingassociated global glomerulosclerosis is likely multifactorial. Dysautoregulation of the afferent and efferent arterioles of the glomerulus may lead to increased glomerular plasma flow, increased glomerular intracapillary pressures, and subsequent 'hyperperfusion' glomerular injury with accumulation of mesangial matrix. 65, 66 The vascular adaptations to functional or structural nephron loss may help preserve the GFR by producing hyperperfusion and hyperfiltration in the surviving functional nephrons. This local glomerular hypertension and hypertrophy may lead to cytokine-mediated mesangial matrix expansion and eventual glomerulosclerosis. Such hyperperfusion-induced glomerular injury is observed with oligomeganephronia, diabetic nephropathy, morbid obesity, and reflux nephropathy. It has been suggested that the aging-associated arterial intimal fibrosis produces ischemia in the aging kidneys that first causes cortical glomerulosclerosis and consequent juxtamedullary glomerular hypertrophy, followed by juxtamedullary glomerulosclerosis. 57 However, another study noted that the superficial cortical glomeruli were 20% larger than the juxtamedullary glomeruli in 12 adult males aged 51-69 years, suggesting that the loss of glomeruli in the superficial cortex might shift perfusion to adjacent functional glomeruli in the superficial cortex and promote their enlargement. 67 The tubulointerstitial changes also could be secondary to the aging-related arterial changes and consequent hypoxia/ischemia in both cortex and medulla. This is suggested by the upregulation, in the aging rat kidney, of hypoxia-induced genes such as hypoxia-inducible factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, glucose transporter-1, and EPO. 68 Similarly, the agingassociated deposition of collagen in the rat kidney correlates with an upregulation of the gene for collagen-1 and a downregulation of the gene for matrix metalloproteinase-1. 69 As described below, advanced glycosylation end products (AGEs) and their receptor play a role in the aging process. They may promote nuclear factor-kB activation and expression of inflammatory genes in the aging kidney. 70, 71 Based on their observations in the kidneys of human tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 transgenic mice, a group of investigators have suggested that tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 could promote aging-related renal fibrosis, at least partly, through inflammation by upregulation of intercellular adhesion moleculer-1 and consequent upregulation of transforming growth factor-b1. 72 The latter is a fibrosispromoting cytokine implicated in aging-associated renal fibrosis. 73 Recently, considerable attention has been paid to the role of arterial aging or arteriosclerosis in the pathogenesis of senescent changes observed in the kidney and other organs. It has been observed that with age, structural fatigue and fracture leads to dilatation and stiffening of elastic arteries. 74, 75 Arterial stiffness, in turn, increases pulse wave velocity 74, 76 and thereby transmission of pulsatile energy to fragile microvessels causing damage and injury in various organs. [77] [78] [79] [80] Systemic microvascular disease may be associated with progressive renal dysfunction in the elderly population. This viewpoint was substantiated by findings of the Cardiovascular Health Study, a prospective, multicenter, cohort study initiated in 1989 to examine cardiovascular risk factors, morbidity, and mortality in elderly Americans. 81 The study showed that retinal microvascular abnormalities were significantly associated with deterioration of renal function, independent of the associated diabetes or hypertension. These observations suggest that renal abnormalities may represent one manifestation of ongoing systemic microvascular damage. Further studies have shown that measures of large artery stiffness are closely related to markers of renal microvascular injury including albuminuria, independent of conventional brachial systolic and diastolic pressure values. [77] [78] [79] [80] In fact, therapeutic interventions aimed at reducing the ill effects of arterial stiffness by lowering the magnitude and frequency of the stretch cycles (to minimize fatigue and fracture of medial elastin in the aorta) can reverse or delay progression of cerebral and renal damage. These maneuvers entail a reduction in early wave reflection, through regular exercise, and use of drugs (angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, nitrates) that relax smooth muscles in large and small conduit arteries throughout the body and cause arterial dilation. 80, [82] [83] [84] The molecular basis of the phenomenon of renal aging is under active investigation. In general, the theories of cellular senescence include genomic instability and telomere loss, oxidative damage, genetic programming, and cell death. 85 Here, we review some of the promising results from the investigations directed specifically at renal aging (Figure 2) .\nTelomeres are DNA-protein complexes, located at the ends of chromosomes. Telomeres protect the chromosomes from fusing with each other. The enzyme telomerase synthesizes the telomeric DNA, which are repeats of the sequence TTAGGG. Most somatic cells do not synthesize telomerase, and therefore telomeres shorten with each cell division. Ultimately, these somatic cells are left with chromosomes that have critically shortened telomeres. The cellular machinery senses the critically short telomeres as DNA-strand breaks, which leads to the activation of p53 and p16 and induction of cell-cycle arrest and replicative senescence. 86, 87 Telomeres shorten with increasing age in the kidney, more rapidly in the renal cortex, where 0.24-0.25% telomere shortening occurs annually. 88 Cumulative oxidative stress is believed to play a major role in the process of cellular aging. The increase in oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation in the aging kidney correlates with an increase in the AGEs and their receptors that can cross-link adjacent proteins. In addition, the AGE-R1, the receptor protective against AGE-mediated injury, is downregulated with aging. 70, 71 Along with reactive oxygen species that can activate ubiquitin-proteasome, AGEs may degrade hypoxia-inducible factor-1a and limit the capacity of the aging cells to form hypoxia-inducible factor-1-DNA-hypoxiaresponsive recognition element complexes. 3, 89, 90 The consequent decrease in the ability of the renal cells to respond to hypoxia could explain the previously mentioned attenuated anemia-induced secretion of EPO and the decreased hypoxiainduced production of vascular endothelial growth factor leading to reduced angiogenesis. 90 In a rat model, renal aging was associated with a 60% reduction in the GFR, a threefold increase in renal F2 isoprostanes (markers of oxidative stress), and increased oxidant-sensitive heme oxygenase, AGEs, and AGE receptors. Pertinently, a diet rich in the antioxidant vitamin E attenuated the aging-related increased expression of heme oxygenase and AGE receptors, suppressed the production of F2 isoprostanes, and increased the GFR by 50% (see ref. 91) . Oxidative stress has also been shown to reduce telomere length. 92 In cultured rabbit proximal tubular epithelial cells, AGEs and even the early-glycosylation end products (Amadori products) directly inhibited NOS activity, and furthermore, AGEs quenched the released nitric oxide (NO). 93 By immunohistochemistry, aging rat kidneys demonstrated a reduction of endothelial NOS (eNOS) in the peritubular capillaries and the appearance of immunodetectable eNOS in the renal tubular epithelial cells and infiltrating mononuclear cells in areas of tubulointerstitial injury. These observations suggest that the aging-related renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis may be secondary to the ischemia associated with peritubular capillary injury and altered eNOS expression. 94 In addition, an aging-related decline in the abundance of renal cortical neuronal NOS has been reported in male Sprague-Dawley rats. The female rat, which is protected from the aging-dependent renal damage, demonstrates maintained levels of renal cortical eNOS and neuronal NOS levels. 95 This may be related to the stimulatory effects of estrogen on the synthesis of eNOS and neuronal NOS. 96 The renin-angiotensin system, through its effects on the angiotensin receptor AT1, may induce the synthesis of reactive oxygen species and transforming growth factor-b1 that produce fibrosis. Indeed, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers ameliorated the aging-related renal injury in rats as shown by a decline in glomerular mesangial expansion and sclerosis, tubular Replicative senescence and oxidative stress are the major factors identified in the process of natural renal aging. These factors as well as renal diseases and toxins ultimately lead to changes in renal arterial system, the most important of which is renal arterial sclerosis. It is suggested that the hypoxic/ischemic milieu created by this arteriopathy produces the familiar aging-related renal morphological changes of glomerular sclerosis, tubular atrophy, and interstitial fibrosis. The subsequent functional insufficiency drives the feedback to renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system to produce hypertension, which then creates a cycle of further arterial and arteriolar damage and renal ischemia. This simplistic schema is complicated by factors such as gender, nitric oxide synthesis and inhibition, renin-angiotensin system, dietary factors (that is, salt load and caloric restriction), and the effect of aging-associated genes such as klotho.\natrophy, interstitial fibrosis, and mononuclear infiltration. 97 This effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may be mediated by their positive modulation of the aging-related dysfunction in the mitochondria, the organelles involved in energy metabolism, and reactive oxygen species production. 98 In addition, it has been shown that AT1 blockade (losartan) prevented renal injuries in aged spontaneously hypertensive rats by enhancing NO bioavailability and ameliorating oxidative stress. 99 A reduced expression of the anti-aging gene Klotho leads to the development of an aging-like syndrome in mice, whereas an overexpression of the Klotho protein leads to a suppression of the aging-related organ degeneration, with an elongation of the lifespan in mice. The Klotho protein is a hormone that mediates its cellular effect by binding to a cellsurface receptor and repressing the intracellular signals of insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1. 100, 101 The anti-aging effect of the Klotho-induced inhibition of insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 signaling appears to be associated with an increased resistance to oxidative stress. Thus, the Klotho protein induces the expression of the antioxidant enzyme, manganese superoxide dismutase, which facilitates neutralization of reactive oxygen species, thereby conferring protection against oxidative stress.\n102 On the other hand, hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress led to a reduced expression of Klotho in a murine inner medullary collecting duct (mIMCD3) cell line. 103 Angiotensin II can downregulate renal expression of Klotho, an effect attenuated by iron chelation and free radical scavenging in a rat model. 104 Klotho may also be involved in vitamin D, calcium, and phosphate metabolism through its proposed enzymatic bglucuronidase action on steroid b-glucuronides and the calcium-channel transient receptor potential vallinoid-5. Klotho may also be an essential cofactor for the stimulation of fibroblast growth factor receptor by fibroblast growth factor-23. 105, 106 Klotho is highly expressed in the human kidney, where it colocalizes with transient receptor potential vallinoid-5 in the distal renal tubular cells. 107 Klotho gene polymorphisms have been associated with bone mineral density in women 108, 109 and with decreased longevity. 110 A homozygous missense mutation in the Klotho gene was recently reported in a 13-year-old girl with severe tumoral calcinosis with dural and carotid artery calcifications. 111 Global gene expression by cDNA microarray analyses have identified more than 500 genes differentially expressed among human kidney samples from young (8 weeks to 8 years), adult (31-46 years), and old (71-88 years) subjects. 112 Not surprisingly, the genes that showed declining expression in the old kidneys included those associated with metabolic processes like respiratory electron transport chain; glucose and lipid metabolism; and protein, amino acid, and nucleotide turnover. Other aging-related changes included altered expression of the cytoskeletal genes. There were also aging-associated increased expressions of the genes associated with extracellular matrix synthesis and turnover and of the genes encoding immune response and inflammatory mediators. On the other hand, the older kidneys showed reduced expressions of the genes associated with collagen catabolism, as well as of the genes encoding glutathionerelated enzymes and the transporters involved in tubular transport of electrolytes, ions, glucose, amino acids, and organic acids. It should be noted that most of the data addressing molecular mechanisms of senescence comes from animal studies. Given the interspecies differences, caution should be exercised in extrapolating these findings to humans."}, {"section_title": "CALORIC RESTRICTION AND RENAL AGING", "text": "The increase in net caloric intake and a sedentary lifestyle has brought upon mankind an epidemic of obesity. Improved eating habits and lifestyle modifications are, therefore, essential to reverse this trend. In addition to this obvious association, caloric restriction has long been studied as a means of achieving longer life spans. More than 80 years ago, McCay et al. 113 demonstrated an extension in the maximum lifespan of rats raised on a life-long calorie-restriction diet without malnutrition. Other studies have confirmed these results and have also shown that the long-term caloric restriction slows the aging-related decline in physiological processes and slows the development of aging-related diseases. 114, 115 Although life-long caloric restriction studies are not available in humans, caloric restriction over a few years have produced significant reductions in body weight, blood pressure, blood cholesterol, and blood sugar, as well as reduced the development of atherosclerosis and ameliorated the decline in diastolic function. [116] [117] [118] Pertinent to this review, caloric restriction in animals has been shown to modulate the aging-related physiological processes in kidney. Caloric restriction attenuated the increased aging-related susceptibility of rat kidney to ischemic injury, perhaps by molecular alterations such as the attenuation of aging-related changes in expression of genes such as claudin-7, kidney injury molecule-1, and matrix metalloproteinase-7. 119 In another study, investigators studied aging-related structural changes in the kidneys of Fischer \u00c2 Brown Norway rats fed with a 40% calorierestriction diet initiated in middle-aged rats, before the onset of significant aging-related renal changes. Compared with age-matched rats on a regular diet, the rats fed with a calorierestricted diet showed reduced glomerulosclerosis, tubular atrophy, interstitial fibrosis, vascular wall thickening, and the expression of cytochrome c oxidase-deficient tubular epithelial cells. 120 Similarly, caloric restriction prevented or delayed the development of structural (glomerulosclerosis, tubulointerstitial damage) and functional changes, as well as morbidity and mortality associated with chronic nephropathy in ad libitum-overfed Sprague-Dawley rats. 121 In 24-month-old F344BN rats, caloric restriction reduced the aging-related proteinuria, extracellular matrix accumulation, and the renal expression of connective tissue growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. As these changes were associated with a decline in the renal expression of sterol regulatory element binding proteins, SREBP-1 and SREBP-2, and a decline in renal triglyceride and cholesterol content, the authors suggested that caloric restriction affects aging-related renal physiology, in part, by altering renal SREBP expression and renal lipid accumulation. 122 Caloric restriction also attenuates the aging-related increase in plasma levels of F2-isoprostanes, markers of oxidative stress that have been implicated in agingrelated renal dysfunctions. 123 Similarly, the markers of oxidative stress, malondialdehyde, and 4-hydroxynonenal were markedly lower in aged rats fed with calorie-restricted diets compared with the aged rats fed ad libitum. In addition, the apoptosis was suppressed in aged rats on calorie-restricted diets, as shown by increased levels of Bcl-2 and procaspase 3 and decreased levels of Bax and cleaved caspase 3."}, {"section_title": "124", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "AGING AND RENAL TRANSPLANTATION", "text": "Given the prevalence of end-stage kidney disease in the elderly, it is not surprising that among the more than 300,000 US patients currently on dialysis, the prevalence rates are the highest among the patients in their seventh and eighth decades of life. 7 Consequently, the number of patients with end-stage kidney disease who could potentially benefit from renal transplantation is greatest in the older age groups. Given the perpetual shortage of and the long waiting list for donor kidneys, kidney transplantation in the elderly with end-stage renal failure raises ethical questions related to the concept of net benefit. Should a donor kidney be transplanted to an elderly patient with comorbidities and an average life expectancy of 10-15 years over a younger patient? Studies have clearly shown that the elderly patients with endstage renal failure do benefit from kidney transplantation. 7, 125, 126 In fact, the relative risk of renal graft failure, adjusted for comorbidities, is statistically similar for renal transplant recipients older than 65 years and their younger counterparts. 127, 128 The most common cause of graft loss in the elderly transplant recipient is the comorbidities-related demise of the patient. Thus, careful screening of elderly patients for comorbidities such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease may help minimize early post-transplant morbidity and mortality. 7 There is currently no age limit for access to renal transplantation in the US, 129 and the patients older than 65 years comprise 13% of all recipients of cadaveric donor kidneys. 7 Another related medicosocial ramification of the aging population is that the average age of the cadaveric kidney donors is increasing, which is contributed also by the decreasing mortality in the young. The 'expanded criteria donor' kidneys allow for the use of kidneys from donors over the age of 60 years or donors over the age of 50 years with two comorbidities including hypertension, death from cerebrovascular accident, or terminal serum creatinine levels greater than 1.5 mg/100 ml (see ref. 130 ). Accordingly, there are two renal-transplant lists in the US: one for standard criteria and the other for expanded criteria donors, with the latter list recommended for older patients, patients with diabetes as the primary cause for renal failure, and patients with difficult vascular access. A comparable Eurotransplant Senior Program in Europe allows for local allocation of kidneys from donors over 65 years of age to recipients over the age for 65 years ('old for old' kidney allocation). Expanded-spectrum donor kidneys now comprise 17% of the cadaveric donor transplants in the US. 131 However, older renal allografts do have an increased risk of graft failure, mainly because of aging-related decline in renal function, predisposition to ischemia and drug toxicity, reduced capacity for repair, and a higher degree of immunogenecity. 132, 133 Yet, most allograft failures in older recipients are due to unrelated death with a functioning allograft, and therefore 'old for old' kidney allocation is a sensible approach. Another strategy for obtaining maximal benefit from expanded criteria donor kidneys is the use of dual renal transplants that allows for the use of two marginal kidneys into one recipient. 134, 135 Pre-implantation histological evaluation of the expanded criteria donor kidney further optimizes their use. In a histological scoring schema, with 0 representing no lesions and 12 representing severe changes in the renal parenchyma, kidneys with a score of 3 or less should have enough viable nephrons for single-kidney transplants, those with scores 4-6 should have enough viable nephrons for dual-kidney transplants, and kidneys with scores higher than 6 are unsuitable for transplantation. 136, 137 "}, {"section_title": "FUTURE DIRECTIONS", "text": "Although substantial progress has been made in the understanding of the renal aging process and the associated decline in renal function, many questions remain unanswered and await future investigation. Improved understanding of renal aging may help to optimize management of renal allografts obtained from older donors. For instance, it has been suggested that the early occurrence of critical telomere shortening and replicative senescence may contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic allograft nephropathy in older allografts. 138 Future studies should seek distinction between the decline in renal function and alteration in renal structure because of aging-associated diseases such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus and that solely because of aging. This information would be critical in promoting health and formulating individualized care for the elderly populations. Further studies also need to further define the role of diet and caloric restriction on the process of renal aging.\nAnother area of potential study is the role of gender in renal aging. It has been increasingly recognized that gender plays a vital role in structural changes and progression of renal impairment associated with senescence. Earlier, we mentioned the results of a study that showed that the reduction in RPF induced by intravenous administration of the NOS inhibitor, L-NAME, increased markedly with aging in men but not women. 26 It has also been shown in male animals that much of the aging-related renal damage, including vascular changes, may be related to androgen production, and that castration can limit the progression of aging-related changes. [139] [140] [141] Furthermore, in some animal models, therapy with estrogen-related compounds can protect males against some of these changes. 142 Further studies are required to investigate the cellular mechanisms that may serve as potential therapeutic targets for the prevention of age-associated renal disease.\nWidely considered as one of the most important and complex biological problems of the twenty-first century, aging is essentially a process of degradation of systems. 143 Currently, a large majority of the studies addressing the molecular pathways involved in aging are focusing on a single or a limited number of pathways. However, to better understand the complex mechanisms of aging and its associated renal dysfunctions, an intensely multidisciplinary approach known as 'systems biology' would be needed to ensure that the elderly remains healthy and productive in the society. 143 "}, {"section_title": "DISCLOSURE", "text": "All the authors declared no competing interests."}]
