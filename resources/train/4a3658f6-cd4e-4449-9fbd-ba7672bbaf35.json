It is due to its flexibility and generality besides the ability to generate an accurate and precise estimation in making prediction. SEM analysis goes through the steps of model specification, data collection, model estimation, model evaluation and also model modification (Zainudin, 2012) .

It is different compared to Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) since it is used to test whether measures of a construct consistent with a researchers' understanding of the nature of that construct (or factor). As such, the objective of CFA is to test whether the data fit a hypothesized measurement model.\nCFA is a crucial part for the measurement model in SEM that is used to obtain the acceptable model fit before modeling the structural model. There are two methods in running CFA; Individual CFA and Pooled CFA (Chong et al., 2014) . To achieve unidimensionality of construct, the factor loading of every all items must be higher or equal to 0.6 (Hair et al., 2006) . Model fit measures could be obtained to assess how well the proposed model captured the covariance between all the items or measures in the model. All redundant items exist in latent constructs should be either removed or constrained. Factor Loading, Absolute, Incremental and Parsimonious fitness indexes must achieve the acceptance level. According to Zainudin (2012) the fitness indices estimations are as follows: Zainudin (2012) "}, {"section_title": "Discriminant Validity", "text": "Discriminant validity is a degree to which scores on a test do not correlate with scores from other tests that are not designed to assess the same variable. Correlation coefficients between measures of a construct and measures of conceptually different variables are usually given as evidence of discriminant validity (Lewis-Beck et al., 2004) . It is a procedure of linking exogenous constructs in a model to examine whether they are highly correlated to each other or otherwise. Exogenous constructs must be independent to each other, in which, the correlation value between them should not exceed 0.85 in order to achieve discriminant validity of construct (Zainudin, 2012) . If the correlation(s) is/are higher than 0.85, one of the highly correlated constructs must be removed or multi-collinearity constructs."}, {"section_title": "Path Analysis", "text": "Path Analysis may consist of simple or multiple statistical regression models. Besides the ability to determine the causal path, it is able to identify the type of mediation exist in a model. The difference between path analysis and conventional regression is the causal path in the model can be modified according to the researcher desire.\nAccording to Zainudin (2012) there are three types of mediation:\ni.\nComplete mediation: Occur when the independent variable links towards the dependent variable only through mediator variable and there is no direct effect of independent variable towards dependent variable.\nii. Partial mediation: Occur when independent variable links towards the dependent variable through mediator variable and there is also a direct effect of independent variable towards dependent variable.\niii.\nNo mediation: Occur when independent variable does not link to the dependent variable through mediator variable but has a direct effect towards dependent variable.\nIn bootstrap approach, two structural models have been constructed; one with the absence of mediator construct and the other one with the existence of mediator construct."}, {"section_title": "Bootstrap", "text": "Bootstrap is one of the crucial parts in modeling structural model when it comes to confirm the type of mediation. In addition, it also allows researcher to assess the stability of parameter estimates that can be applied when the assumptions of large sample size and multivariate normality may not hold. In order to perform this approach, two models need to be built; one with the existence of mediator construct and the other, otherwise. The type of mediation should then be confirmed based on the direct and indirect effects reported. Table 2 show that the fitness indexes of the model achieved the required level after the Pooled CFA has been conducted. The factor loading of all items toward its' respective constructs are greater than 0.6, therefore it can be concluded that the models' unidimensionality is achieved. Besides that, all latent exogenous constructs are correlated with the correlation strength of less than 0.85. Therefore, no multi-collinearity problem exists and the discriminant validity is achieved. Table 3 shows the reliable items for Malaysian students that have been obtained for measurement model through the Pooled CFA. Initially, school, teacher, motivation, self-confidence and attitude constructs consist of nine(9), eight(8), six(6), seven(7) and five (5) items respectively. The other items were dropped from the model for having factor loadings of low than 0.6. The low reliability of the items may jeopardize the model fit indexes measurement, hence were dropped from the model."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Pooled Confirmatory Factor", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Figure-2.

Hence, these items were dropped from the model because they are not reliable and may jeopardize the model estimates.\nIn the discriminant validity test, it has been explored that the correlation of all latent constructs are below 0.85.\nThe low correlations indicate that all constructs are independent to each other. In other word, there is no constructs are measuring the same thing. In achieving discriminant validity, redundant items in achievement latent construct; ach01 and ach04 have been also constrained.\nThe path analysis has been conducted in the absence and existence of mediator latent construct. In the absence of mediator latent construct, all exogenous latent constructs show significant direct effects toward endogenous latent construct. This indicates that school, teacher, self-confidence and motivation have direct contribution toward students' achievement. In the existence of mediator latent construct, all exogenous latent constructs show significant indirect effects toward endogenous latent construct through mediator latent construct except for school.\nThis indicates that teachers, self-confidence and motivation have indirect contributions or partial mediation toward students' achievement through attitude while there is no mediation occurs for school construct. In addition, this finding also indicates that teacher, self-confidence and motivation have significant contributions toward students' attitude.\nHowever, there are two types of effect exist in the model; positive and negative effects. School and teacher have negative effects toward students' achievement, the same goes to the effect of school towards attitude. The negative effects indicate that increase in unit of school and teacher will decrease in the students' attitude and/or achievement.\nFor example, the more a student likes his/her mathematics teacher, the lower the achievement of the student in mathematics will be. In the bootstrap approach, the indirect effects of exogenous latent constructs toward endogenous latent construct have been confirmed. The summary table shows that all exogenous latent constructs have significant effects toward endogenous latent construct; achievement. However, for indirect effect result, all exogenous latent constructs except school have indirect effect toward achievement through attitude. This finding concludes that the effects obtained in the path analysis have been confirmed."}]
