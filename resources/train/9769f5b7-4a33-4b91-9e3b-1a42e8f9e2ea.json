[{"section_title": "Conversion Factors", "text": "["}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "This product is a geospatial, 19-class, national land use series. The main product consists of five 60-m raster datasets (ArcGIS grids) for the conterminous United States, which represent the years 1974, 1982, 1992, 2002, and 2012 . These time steps coincide with previous selected tabular land use and land cover estimates from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Census of Agriculture and National Resources Inventory. A series of 14 supplemental grids are provided, which represent annual estimated timber activity for the period 1999-2012.\nThe product is not directly derived from imagery; instead, it maps anthropogenic land use changes from existing datasets. The basic method uses a slightly modified version of the National Land Cover Dataset 2011 (NLCD 2011; Jin and others, 2013 ) that has been recoded to a schema of land uses, and mapped backward in time to develop datasets for the four earlier time periods. The work was completed as part of the U.S. Geological Survey's (USGS) National WaterQuality Assessment (NAWQA) Program. The name for it is the \"NAWQA Wall-to-wall Anthropogenic Land Use Trends\" (NWALT) .\nWork for the project was performed primarily using ArcGIS 10.1 (Esri, 2015) tools and services. The term \"grid\" in this paper is used to refer to the raster-formatted datasets produced.\nWhile the product's nominal dates are 1974, 1982, 1992, 2002, and 2012 , the information for each is derived from data sources that might span multiple years of approximately that time period (see below). For example, it is better to think of the 1992 dataset as \"early 1990s\" information, as opposed to a snapshot of an exact instant in time.\nThe rationale for the product is severalfold:\n1. NAWQA's Trends studies have a need for consistently derived land cover/use data of the highest feasible spatial resolution from (at least) the 1970s to present for the conterminous United States. Some existing datasets capture some elements of land use; for example, housing unit density (hden) (Hammer and others, 2004 ) is a measure of residential urbanization at \"partial block group\" scale, and the Census of Agriculture (CoA) enumerates cultivated land by agricultural use at the county scale. A number of global and other broad-scale time-series products have been produced; however, no dataset currently exists that (a) is a national time series that inclusively maps all land and uses going back at least to the 1970s, (b) has reasonably high spatial resolution, (c) has consistent methodology for all eras, and (d) has reasonable agreement with other major observed datasets (for example, agreeing with agriculture or population change data from U.S. Federal census agencies).\n2. Few, if any, land cover time-series products have focused on details of land use-how humans use the land-in essence, the economic function of the land (Campbell, 1996) . The intention for this product is to provide as much detailed class information as is feasible with current data (for example, specifying more specific uses within the Developed class).\n3. Most broad-scale studies using land cover/use data in the United States are based on the NLCD, which has consistent national datasets for 2001, 2006 , and 2011, but not for prior years. This product extends much of the land use utility of the NLCD to previous eras.\nThe following organizations have produced statewide or region-wide trend statistics for the United States for various periods, scales, and land use types, going back to at least the 1970s:\n\u2022 U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) CoA (U.S.\nDepartment of Agriculture, 2014a): 1850-2012, in roughly 5-year increments since the 1950s, countylevel enumeration of cultivated land.\n\u2022 USDA National Resources Inventory (NRI; U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2013 Agriculture, ): 1982 Agriculture, -2010 , in 5-year increments, coinciding with CoA years, Statelevel, statistical survey of land use and natural resource conditions on non-Federal lands.\n\u2022 USDA Economic Research Service (ERS; U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2014b Agriculture, ): 1945 Agriculture, -2007 in 5-year increments, coinciding with CoA years, Statelevel economic surveys.\n\u2022 USGS Land Cover Trends (LC Trends; Sleeter and others, 2013 Sleeter and others, ) group: 1973 Sleeter and others, -2000 Sleeter and others, (years 1973 Sleeter and others, , 1980 Sleeter and others, , 1986 Sleeter and others, , 1992 Sleeter and others, , and 2000 by Level III ecoregions.\nWhile each of these sources provides potentially useful information, the products do not necessarily agree with each other because of differing methodologies, time periods, class definitions, and goals. Not all of them have data that are comparable over time, even within their own series. For example, the method by which the ERS classifies urban land has changed several times over the years (which they note), in some cases leading to considerable decreases in percent of urban land classified over a period of time for a State, an unlikely real trend. These sources were examined in detail and results were compared to them as part of our validation (see below). The lack of consensus of these data sources regarding land use classifications reflects the fact that land use is typically a more abstract concept than the more straightforward measurement of surface area cover (land cover). For example, a stand of forest in a land cover-only dataset would likely be unambiguously classified as \"Forest.\" The identical stand, however, could potentially be used for numerous functions: Timber operations, woodland pasture, conservation, urban recreation, and so forth. The classes defined in this product are those for which there is reasonably accurate, consistent, and accessible information, and those that would be most useful to the study of water quality."}, {"section_title": "Purpose and Scope", "text": "The purpose of this report is to describe the methods and data sources for creating a consistent land use map product for five time periods between 1974 and 2012 for the conterminous United States. The goal was to create a product that (a) is consistent as possible with the NLCD 2001-2011 series, (b) agrees with other key data sources such as census-derived information, (c) uses a consistent method for all years, and (d) represents land use as accurately as possible. The focus of the product is to capture major land use trends."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "The basic land use classification method had three broad steps: (a) Make a slightly modified version of the NLCD 2011 for use as a base grid, (b) recode it to a schema of land uses, and (c) remap those uses by incorporating data from a variety of sources, backward in time every 10 years, to develop datasets with identical spatial extent and classifications for 1974, 1982, 1992, and 2002 . The country was divided into 12 major regions ( fig. 1 ) for processing purposes, based on USDA ERS Major Land Use regions (Department of Agriculture, 2014b).

{"section_title": "Modifying the NLCD 2011 for Use as a Base Grid", "text": "The changes made to the NLCD 2011 to use as a base grid were resampling from the original 30-m to 60-m, thinning rural roads, and reclassifying a small number of agriculture pixels in highly urban areas.\nResampling to 60 m.-Everything in this project was processed at 60 m (nearest neighbor resampling), primarily to allow for reasonable processing time, improve portability, and eliminate problems from some software limitations on large datasets.\nThinning rural roads.-The NLCD 2001-2011 series typically \"burned in\" all roads, regardless of whether or not they would take up the majority of a 30-m pixel (most minor roads are typically 8-10 m wide). One can make the case that in some applications this is beneficial in that it helps to quantify scattered ex-urban residential areas or impervious surfaces that are otherwise not captured by 30-m Landsat imagery. However, it also may have a confounding effect in that it typically makes it more difficult to distinguish the amount of actual \"urbanization\"-in the sense of the built environment of central places-in watersheds. For example, watersheds with virtually no human presence but that had numerous farming or minor roads in them were more difficult to distinguish from watersheds that had low levels of actual urbanization (that is, presence of human population). Furthermore, other major land cover projects have similarly produced \"reduced roads\" versions of land cover (for example, Irani and Claggett, 2010) . Therefore, housing density and other ancillary information were used to filter out rural roads, as follows.\nFirst, graduated zones of housing density were created over the landscape. Where hden was >62 units/km 2 (see Note 3) or an NLCD 2011 Developed pixel coincided with an area of known current non-residential Developed land use (for example, schools, industrial areas, oil/gas fields, and so forth), none of the Developed pixels were changed. For hden zones less than 62, a graduated and increased percentage of pixels were recoded to a non-Developed class. In areas of 0 hden and no known non-residential urban uses, 95 percent of pixels were recoded. The vast majority of pixels recoded represented minor roads. Major roads were kept, regardless of where they were located (see Note 4) . In this way, the entire Developed class more closely represents true urban uses than the published NLCD 2011.\nThe overall effect is a significant, but for many purposes, beneficial reduction of the number of pixels classified as Developed in highly nonurbanized areas not related to commercial and industrial activities ( fig. 2) The rural-road pixels that were changed were reclassified with what the land likely was without their presence. This was done primarily using focalmean commands in ArcGIS, which essentially map majority presence of nearby pixels. A rural farming road would therefore likely be reclassified to agriculture pixels. The overall effect was to slightly increase the percentages of all other land cover types in the starting-point base grid.\nReclassifying a small number of agriculture pixels in highly urban areas to a Developed class. A very small number of NLCD agriculture pixels (NLCD classes 81 and 82) were recoded to a Developed class in our base grid where hden exceeded 1,000. This was based on the visual observation that agriculture pixels in areas of such very high density urbanization were almost always in reality an urban use, such as school playing fields or urban parks. This change had a very minor effect and only affected 10,000 of 497,000,000 total 60-m agriculture pixels."}, {"section_title": "Classes", "text": "This product primarily categorizes types and intensity of land uses, with classes conceptually similar to those proposed by Theobald (2014) . Theobald implemented a hierarchical 79-class land use schema, and produced a national 30-m raster for the current era (approximately 2011-2013) with 61 of the classes populated. Theobald's product, termed the National Land Use Dataset (NLUD), is based on a composite of classification schemas, primarily that of Anderson and others (1976) and the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS; U.S. Department of Commerce, 2015) . However, the thematic detail of many of the classes (for example, \"Orchards\") is not readily reproducible with current data going back to the 1970s at a sub-county scale. Therefore, this product uses a somewhat different class structure that is more readily reproducible back in time, but still focused on anthropogenic uses. This product contains six broad classes (\"Level 1\"), and 19 subclasses (\"Level 2\") (table 1). Detailed class descriptions are provided in appendix 2. As in the Theobald schema, the aquatic classes (Water and Wetlands) are primarily representations of \"cover,\" while all other classes are representations of \"use.\" (Water is also partly a use class in that it incorporates water-body changes from reservoir construction and dam removals since 1974.) Because the NAWQA Program studies aquatic systems, it is valuable to have explicit representations of those cover classes. (Jin and others, 2013) . Right-side panel shows NWALT base grid, after rural roads thinning. Area shown is a portion of Fauquier County, Virginia (NWALT, U.S. Geological Survey National Water-Quality Assessment Program's Wall-to-Wall Anthropogenic Land Use Trends).\nAs in the NLUD (Theobald, 2014), aside from Water, the Level 1 classes broadly distinguish the major settings in which humans use and interact with the land:\nDeveloped: The built environment; settings where residences, employment, and recreation predominate.\nSemi-Developed: The \"near-built\" environment; settings that are in close proximity to Developed lands and (or) are partially used for the same purposes.\nProduction: Settings in which natural resources are produced (Agriculture) or removed (Mining and Timber).\nConservation: Land set aside for natural areas or wildlife protection.\nLow Use: Land not discernible as being in any of the above categories; that is, there is no evidence of regular human usage."}, {"section_title": "Information from USGS Historical and Other Land Use/Land Cover Datasets", "text": "There have been three primary general purpose land cover/use datasets produced by the USGS for the Nation over the last 35 years at fairly high resolution-the GIRAS (1970s; Price and others, 2007) , the NLCD 1992 (early 1990s; U.S. Geological Survey, 2014c), and the NLCD01- 06-11 (2001 Jin and others, 2013) . (See Note 2 regarding the GIRAS). It is clear there are methodological differences between the three series and they are not directly comparable \"as is.\" However, there are also great similarities among them, and each provides quite a lot of information about each era. In examining them, it is clear that there are large areas of the United States that are, and have stayed, an unambiguous type over the last 35 years, and for which the products all agree, particularly at Anderson Level 1 (Anderson and others, 1976) . For example, large areas of national forest are classified as \"forest\" in all of those products; New York City is classified as \"Urban\" in all of those products; very large areas of the western United States are classified as \"Shrub/Grassland\" in all of those products; almost all the pixels representing large water bodies are classified as \"Water,\" and so forth.\nOur reasoning was that if there was perfect agreement at Anderson Level 1 (Water, Urban, Barren/Mining, Forest, Shrub/Grassland, Agriculture, Wetlands, and Ice/Snow) among the GIRAS, NLCDe 1992, and NLCD 2011, those pixels were less likely to have changed in reality over that period and could represent a \"low-probability change\" mask-an overlay that could mask out some parts of the processing. The areas of perfect agreement among those three datasets represent roughly 60 percent of the United States. We first visually inspected many examples of these pixels (see Note 5), in part, using GoogleEarth\u00a9 historical imagery (Google, 2013) and, in part, using online historical Landsat (Esri, 2014b) . Virtually 100 percent of them appeared to have not changed Anderson Level 1 classification over that period. They were next compared to a high-quality, manually derived land use dataset spanning 28 years for the State of Massachusetts (MassGIS; State of Massachusetts, 2014). For the State of Massachusetts, more than 95 percent of the low-probability mask pixels did not change between 1971 and 1999. Pixels outside the mask had a roughly four times higher chance of change. This led us to conclude that little error would be introduced by maintaining them as a mask for some elements of processing. Namely, in this dataset, the pixels in this mask are excluded from changing Level 1 class in the Developed and Agriculture processing shown below. They may still change as a result of manual polygon processing, and may change Level 2 class. The processing for all change methods is described below and in appendixes 3 and 4."}, {"section_title": "Method for Building Datasets", "text": "Once the 2012 base grid was built as described above, it was recoded to the schema of 19 land use classes presented above. A stepwise approach was then used to sequentially develop each grid so that after the 2012 base was developed, the 2002 grid was developed from that, then 1992, and so forth. Each grid was thus built from that of the year that was previously processed."}, {"section_title": "Coding 2012 Land Uses", "text": "The following is a brief description of how the 2012 base grid was reclassified to the NWALT land use structure by class. Appendix 3 provides a more detailed stepwise logic flow for the process.\n11 -Water: Identical to NLCD 2011 water (NLCD class 11), with the exception of a very small number of Water pixels added where minor roads were removed, and they were over a water body (for example, a minor road that was a bridge).\n12 -Wetlands: The Wetlands class in this entire series is a constant mask (area of no change) of \"core wetlands,\" comprised of pixels that were classified as Wetlands in all three of the NLCD 2011, NLCD 2001, and the NLCDe 1992 datasets. Because there is not very consistent or spatially explicit national information about wetlands for the time period of this dataset, it is believed that having a constant wetlands mask-pixels that almost certainly represented Wetlands over the life of this data series-is preferable to excluding it as a class. Options for modeling wetlands changes for future versions of this product are under consideration.\n21-27 -Developed: Pixels that were classified as Developed (21-24) in the NLCD 2011, and that remained after the rural-roads thinning described above. Developed Level 2 classes were coded following the method described in Falcone and Homer (2012) , and were based on six primary data sources: HSIP lines (roads and railroads), land use polygons, and day-versus-night population rasters (Homeland Security Infrastructure Program, 2012); Esri landmark polygons (Esri, 2014a) and lines; hden (Hammer and others, 2004) ; employment data (U.S. Department of Commerce, 2014); Theobald (2014) national land use data; and in-house-derived land use polygons (see Note 6) . Classes were distinguished primarily on (a) whether or not the pixel intersected a known current land use polygon or line (for example, a hospital, park, industrial area, and so forth), (b) the ratio of daytime to nighttime population, (c) type and intensity of block-level employment (see Note 7), and (d) hden.\n31 -Semi-Developed, Urban Interface High: Any NLCD 2011 pixel that was not in a Water, Developed, Production, or Conservation class, and was in a highly urban area. A highly urban area was defined as hden >500 units/km 2 or in an urban core area (see Note 8).\n32 -Semi-Developed, Urban Interface Low Medium: Any NLCD 2011 pixel that was not in a Water, Developed, Production, or Conservation class, was in an area with a hden between 16-500 units/km 2 , and was not in a U.S. Geological Survey Gap Analysis Program (GAP) status class 1, 2, or 3 in the Protected Areas Database CBI Edition V2 (Conservation Biology Institute, 2013) . This class maps primarily suburban and ex-urban areas located amongst and proximal to Developed lands.\n33 -Semi-Developed, Anthropogenic Other. Any NLCD 2011 pixel not in any other use class, but had very probable non-residential anthropogenic use, based on agreement of GIRAS and current-day uses. These include primarily recreation or industrial uses not captured by the NLCD 2011 as Developed. This is a minor class, comprising much less than 1 percent of any region's pixels.\n41 -Production, Mining/Extraction. Any pixel that was barren (31) in the NLCD 2011, and intersected a mask of mining/extraction areas developed for this project (see Note 9).\n42 -Production, Timber and forest cutting. Any pixel that would otherwise be coded as NWALT class 50 (no apparent land use), intersects a Landfire (U.S. Geological Survey, 2014b) 2012 area with a disturbance code of \"clearcut,\" \"thinning,\" \"harvest,\" \"mastication,\" \"other mechanical,\" or \"unknown,\" has very low evidence of urbanization or agriculture, and the pixel had been in a forest class in any one of GIRAS, NLCDe 1992 , NLCD 2001 , or NLCD 2011 . At present, the Timber class is maintained as a series of separate annual grids to avoid possible confusion with pre-1999 years, when Landfire was not available. These are national 60-m grids with all pixels classified as \"Timber\" or \"Not Timber.\" 43 -Production, Crops: Any pixel that was classified as Cultivated Crops (82) in the NLCD 2011. A small number of Crop pixels exist in this product that did not exist in the NLCD, where minor roads were removed and the proximal land use was crops.\n44 -Production, Pasture/Hay: Any pixel that was classified as Pasture/Hay (81) in the NLCD 2011. A small number of Pasture/Hay pixels exist in this product that did not exist in the NLCD, where minor roads were removed and the proximal land use was pasture/hay.\n45 -Production, Grazing Potential: There are certainly areas in the United States that have seasonal or occasional grazing that are part of the NLCD grassland and shrubland categories, although most users do not typically categorize these classes as Agriculture. In the Census of Agriculture data, total amount of pastureland + hay-alfalfa is typically greater than what is represented by the NLCD in its class 81. This project attempts to map those areas where grazing is most likely as follows: Any pixel that is classified as Forest (41-43), Shrub (52), Grassland (71), or Wetlands (90, 95) in the NLCD 2011, that would otherwise be coded as NWALT class 50 (no apparent other land use); pixel is within 1 km of a water body (NLCD or NHD 1:24k water body) or within 500 m of a streamline; slope is <30 percent, and was in a Pasture/Hay class in the NLCDe 1992 and the CDL 2009; has hden <124, and is not on a military base, national park, or similar unlikely grazing area.\nIn this paper, when referring to \"Agriculture\" in general (for example, in validation), we have taken the sum of classes 43 and 44, primarily to be as consistent as possible with the NLCD. However, class 45 represents in essence a \"swing\" class; users may or may not wish to combine it with classes 43 and 44 with representing Agriculture for their purposes.\n50 -Low use: Any NLCD 2011 pixel not classified in another class; that is, there is no obvious other land use.\n60 -Very Low Use, Conservation: Any NLCD 2011 pixel not identified as having another land use, and in a GAP status 1 area (\"most protected\"; see Note 10) in the Protected Areas Database CBI Edition V2 (Conservation Biology Institute, 2013) . Assumed very low human usage.\nA sample of the results of the above process is given in figure 3."}, {"section_title": "Mapping Changes from 2012 to Previous Time Periods", "text": "Once the 2012 grid was coded to the NWALT schema, the previous eras' grids were built in sequence. The method followed a stepwise approach, essentially adding a series of masks for each class ( fig. 4) . At the end, those pixels for which no obvious land use can be identified were put in class 50, Low Use. Very broadly, the steps observed the following sequence, where Water is masked first, then, Wetlands, then Conservation, and so forth:\nWater \u2192 Wetlands \u2192 Conservation \u2192 Developed (Level 1) \u2192 Mining \u2192 Agriculture (Level 1) \u2192 Agriculture (Level 2 -Crops versus Pasture/Hay) \u2192 Grazing Potential \u2192 Semi-Developed \u2192 Developed (Level 2) \u2192 Low Use The Timber class is processed as a post-production activity, as described below.\nThe following gives an overview description of how each of these classes was processed. Appendix 4 provides a more detailed stepwise logic flow for the process. As with Water above, when a Conservation pixel was reclassified to non-Conservation in an earlier year, it was assigned an interim class based on grid values of the appropriate historical land cover/use dataset for that time period. That interim classification could then change based on subsequent processing. fig. 1 ). For example, for the NorthEast region, the NWALT 2012 grid has 8.92 percent classified as Developed. Based on hden changes, the target goals for 2002, 1992, 1982, and 1974 were 8.47, 8.09, 7.65, and 7 .18 percent, respectively. Two assumptions are made in this process: (a) That Development is irreversible once it occurs. (See rationale for this assumption in Caveats and Assumptions section below.) That is, Developed pixels in 1974 will always be a subset of Developed pixels in 1982, which in turn are a subset of Developed pixels in 1992, and so forth; and (b) that the relationship of hden change to Developed lands change does not change substantially over time within a region. That is, if an x change in hden translates to a y change in Development for the latest 10 years, then that relationship will roughly be the same for previous eras.\nThe method used to achieve these target goals for each region was to create graduated zones of hden (as was done for the roads-thinning step), then a graduated number of pixels were marked for reclassification to a non-Developed class from each zone until the goal was achieved. The process uses a heuristic starting point of the number of pixels to be selected by zone, which is then adjusted so that the number of pixels reclassified is tailored to that region and year. The selection of which pixels are to be reclassified is guided by surfaces representing three parameters: Magnitude of hden change, the hden for the year in question, and whether or not the pixel was in a Developed class in a historical land cover/use dataset. This was further facilitated by a random number-generated grid, which allowed selection of a specific number of pixels within those subgroups. Non-residential changes (for example, an industrial area) are likewise incorporated based on the historical land cover/use datasets, as well as estimates about the magnitude of major road changes over broad regions (American Road and Transportation Builders Association, 2014) (see note 13). The overall Developed change, both residential and non-residential, is assumed to approximate the change indicated by the target goal number.\nAt the end of this process, a broad manual review was done of each region, comparing the NWALT result to historical imagery and land cover datasets. In some cases, manual adjustments using correction polygons were made as a result of this.\nAs with Water and Conservation above, when a Developed pixel was reclassified to non-Developed in an earlier year, it was assigned an interim class based on the appropriate historical land cover/use. The exact location of which pixels should be changed within each county was based primarily on (a) mask of \"low-probability change\" (noted above), and (b) as with the Developed processing, a random number-generated grid combined with information from historical land cover datasets to identify locations that were more or less likely to be agricultural in nature (see Note 17). The HYDE data provided supportive information as to sub-county change locations; 60-m pixels that fell in the larger HYDE pixels with very large changes in agriculture have an increased chance of changing to or from agriculture in our grids."}, {"section_title": "Agriculture (Level 2 -Crops versus Pasture/Hay):", "text": "Once all Agriculture was identified, those pixels were reclassified to Crops (class 43) and Pasture/Hay (class 44). (See Summary section for guidance on whether class 45 may be considered \"Agriculture.\") For years prior to 2012, changes in the percentage of crop vs pasture/hay were driven by the CoA regional and countylevel change in the following ratio:\nwhere CP = Cropland Pasture, HayAlf = Hay-Alfalfa, and TC = Total Cropland (see Note 18). For all years, and as with overall Agriculture above, pixels are modified based on graduated zones of increase and decrease in this ratio. The goal of the process was to match the regional trend in increase or decrease in the proportion of Pasture/Hay, with the greatest changes occurring in counties with the largest ratio changes.\nAs with the process used to distinguish overall Agriculture, distinguishing which specific pixels within the county were likely to represent Crop versus Pasture/ Hay was assisted by sub-county information. These were namely (a) a USDA/USGS soil-capability class dataset, which classified land into zones that are more or less likely to be suited to crops, (b) a Digital Elevation Model (DEM)-derived slope grid based on USGS National Elevation Data, which similarly is a controlling factor for location of crops (Baker and Capel, 2011) , (c) historical indication of Crop versus Pasture/Hay from the NLCDe 1992, and (d) a random number-generated grid, which allows selection of relatively more or fewer pixels to be affected. These created a probability surface of where Crop versus Pasture/Hay is more likely to be, with the magnitude of change controlled by the magnitude of the (CP+HayAlf)/TC ratio change. 9. Semi-Developed: The urban interface classes 31 and 32 are based almost entirely on hden mapping from the SILVIS lab housing density product (Hammer and others, 2004) . Class 31 also incorporates a constant set of pixels that represented an \"urban core\" mask (described in Note 8). Class 32 is based entirely on hden for each era. The logic for mapping class 33 did not change from year to year, but is intended to simply capture pixels where there is very likely a miscellaneous anthropogenic use (primarily recreation or industrial) in any year of the dataset."}, {"section_title": "Developed (Level 2):", "text": "As with the method for Agriculture, once the Level 1 Developed pixels were identified above, they were coded to their Level 2 classes (21-27). This was based primarily on the current-day urban use (method generally described in Falcone and Homer, 2012, and broadly here in appendix 3). At present (version 1 of this product), with minor exceptions, Developed pixels that are coded as a non-Residential class (21-24) in a later year remain in that class in a prior year, and Developed pixels in a Residential class (25-27) likewise remain Residential, although may change Residential class based on that year's hden. We are aware that \"interurban\" class changes may occur (for example, a residential area becoming commercial, but also believed to be very uncommon. (See more discussion on this topic in the Caveats and Assumptions section.) We are investigating methods with which those kinds of interurban class changes may be accurately captured over time for future versions of this product. Those changes that were successfully captured in this product were a result of manual polygon delineations.\nAfter coding the Developed pixels to classes 21-27, a manual check was performed at a scale of approximately 1:100,000 over the entire grid. Some specific land use types are difficult to capture completely correctly using automation (for example, some industrial areas). Where errors were found, correction polygons were digitized, and the process was run again.\n11. Low Use: Any pixel that was not classified into any of the above classes was classified as class 50.

The focus was chiefly on current land use; however, spot checks on historical land use were also performed. The grid was compared against current and historical GoogleEarth \u00a9 imagery (Google, 2013), current and historical land cover datasets, and guided by hundreds of thousands of point locations of features available from the HSIP and EPA datasets. That review process yielded this project's in-house derived database of more than 45,000 land use polygons representing primarily the current era. This supplemented or corrected information from other sources. This was in addition to the nearly 5,000 dam-creation and dam-removal sites examined and the 1,400 conservation area establishment dates manually researched.\nIn the manual review process, we were particularly attentive to areas of great change as indicated by other sources. From Census county population data, we calculated the percent of population change by county for all U.S. counties (n =3,109) for the period 1970-2010, ranked them, and did an extra manual review of the counties showing the greatest relative population change.

Similarly, Claasen and others (2011) found that between 1997 and 2007 in nearly the same States (North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, Minnesota, and Iowa), there was a net increase of 670,000 acres of cropland converted from grasslands.\nWe compared the above findings to what the NLCD and our product indicated for the five States of the Wright and Wimberly study. The NLCD 2006-2011 showed a net increase of 300,000 acres from natural vegetated categories (52, 71, 90, and 95) to Cropland (82), and the NLCD 2001-2011 showed a net increase of 410,000 acres of those same categories for those five States (and only a minor difference if including net forest to cropland conversion-308,000 and 430,000 acres, respectively, for 2006-2011 and 2001-2011) .

Because there have been method changes in their sources for some land use categories, it is not possible to strictly compare some of them as a time series, and in other cases their categories are a mix of land cover/use (for example, grassland pasture and range) and do not match the categories of this product. However, we do compare our results to ERS results in several cases, where feasible, as follows:\nDeveloped lands. Although this ERS category has changed methods over time, the most recent ERS year that matches this product is 2002; for that year, the ERS measures the amount of land in urban areas for the lower 48 States at 3.13 percent. For that same year, the NWALT measures the amount in Developed lands at 3.27 percent, and measures an additional 2.57 percent as Semi-Developed.\nTotal Cropland.

Nonetheless, all three products show the same trend: the amount of total cropland increasing back to 1982, then decreasing from 1982 to 1974. \u2022 Urbanization is assumed to be irreversible; a pixel classified as Developed in time t will still be Developed in time t+1. (An extremely rare exception in our process is made in the case where an urban pixel may be reclassified as Water if a new reservoir is put in). The irreversibility of urbanization is commonly assumed in other urban studies (for example, Zhang and Guindon, 2005) . As a test of this, we examined the MassGIS dataset noted above, and 99 percent+ of pixels that were classified as urban in 1971 were still urban in 1999."}, {"section_title": "Caveats and Assumptions", "text": "\u2022 Urban interclass changes (for example, residential becoming commercial) are assumed to be uncommon, and are not captured in the current version of this product. The belief that they are uncommon is also based on the unpublished work by Zhang and Guindon, as well as our own examination of the MassGIS data. When classified into four broad categories (residential, commercial, industrial, and recreation), 98 percent+ of MassGIS pixels that were urban in 1971 were still the same subtype in 1999. Future versions of this product may be able to capture these minor changes.\n\u2022 A small number of road segments (part of Developed, Major Transportation; class 21) will be misclassified. Although some changes are captured from known road construction, the primary method for modeling major road changes is by reducing the number of road pixels slightly with each earlier era. This has the effect that over a large area, the percent of pixels that are \"major roads\" are likely to be approximately correct; however, some specific road segments will be wrong. This likely injects a small amount of overall error, given the small component major roads comprise of the entire grid. That is, class 21 comprises only about one-half of 1 percent of any year's grid, and major road pixels make up only a subcomponent of that, with airports and rail comprising the rest.\n\u2022 Water changes are limited to those resulting from changes in reservoirs being built or dams being removed. Water bodies <150 acre-feet, except in rare instances, do not change in this product, and are represented as they are in the NLCD 2011.\n\u2022 This product is based on the NLCD 2011, so errors in that dataset are likely to be carried through the processing. For example, a quarry classified as Agriculture in the NLCD 2011 will still be coded as Agriculture in this product's 2012 grid, even if we have visually noted the error.\n\u2022 It is not feasible to map changes in oil/gas development alone with these data. Hydrofracturing and other oil/ gas development activities have increased dramatically in some parts of the country (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2012; U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2014e); however, there is not consistent data with which to map surficial effects at a scale useful to this product, particularly going back to early years. Natural gas wellheads are relatively small features often scattered amongst other land cover/use types, and only partially captured even by the NLCD. There are notable difficulties in matching activities that are chiefly subsurface in nature to land use, which is chiefly surficial in nature. To the degree it is captured, oil/gas changes are a partial component of classes 23 (Industrial/Military) and 41 (Mining/Extraction).\n\u2022 At present, class 42 Timber is being kept as a series of separate grids, as data are not available for all years. Those pixels are classified as 50 in the main product grids from which they are drawn (2002 and 2012).\n\u2022 Mining changes shown in this data series are likely to have more error and less consistency associated with them than other classes, particularly for the years 1974-1992, as evidenced by results from the MassGIS comparison.

A few summary points are provided as user guidance below:\n\u2022 Because this product recoded a portion of rural Developed pixels in the NLCD 2011 (mainly rural roads) to a non-Developed class, the Developed class of this product will likely more closely represent \"urbanization\"-in the sense of the built environment of central places-than the NLCD 2011 itself.\n\u2022 This product further maps changes in suburban and ex-urban residential areas as Semi-Developed lands.\nIn parts of the country, some of the most significant changes in the landscape over the last 40 years have been in these settings.\n\u2022 Many projects using land cover/use data have an interest in only a single statistic representing Agriculture; that is, they are not examining Level 2 detail.\nIn this paper and validation, we have considered \"Agriculture\" to be the sum of classes 43 and 44. Class 45 (Grazing Potential), however, is in essence a \"swing\" class; depending on their own judgment, users may also want to consider this class to be part of total agriculture as well.\n\u2022 The overall philosophy of this project was to balance the following four goals: (1) Creating a product that was as consistent as possible with the NLCD 2001-2011 series, (2) agreeing as much as possible with other key data sources, (3) keeping all methods as consistent as possible for all years, and (4) making it as accurate as possible. In some cases, these goals conflict slightly. For example, the data for later years are likely to be more accurate than the earlier years. However, as evidenced by the MassGIS validation results, there appear to be only small differences for the major classes (little change in agreement with the MassGIS data going back in time for Agriculture and Developed). There is some tradeoff in achieving all four of these goals simultaneously.\n\u2022 The data are designed to be used for zonal comparisons (for example, comparing watersheds through time). The data are best used aggregated to zonal areas of 100 km 2 and coarser. As points of comparison, the median size of HUC-12 watersheds in the United States is 86 km 2 ; the median size of HUC10s is 468 km 2 . The median size of counties in the conterminous United States is about 1,600 km 2 .\n\u2022 It should further be stressed that these data are one representation of reality. Historical conditions are difficult to capture precisely, and land use in particular is subject to interpretation. It is clear that different organizations and research efforts define land uses in different ways. The goal of this project was to take an NLCD 2011-based version of the land, modify it with the most consistent datasets available, and present a reasonable scenario of how the land was used over the last four decades."}, {"section_title": "Future Enhancements", "text": "The following are under consideration as potential enhancements to future versions of this product:\n\u2022 Update with NLCD 2016 and CoA 2017 for future years.\n\u2022 Wetlands changes, if possible.\n\u2022 More comprehensive capture of interurban class changes, as is possible.\n\u2022 Enhanced capture of industrial, landfill, and mining.\n\u2022 Breakout of golf courses and (or) other types of recreational uses as separate classes.\n\u2022 Enhanced capture of Conservation areas (may be able to get Establishment Dates for many more Protected Areas from CBI).\n\u2022 Perhaps breakout of Oil/Gas use as a separate class, depending on availability of currently proprietary data. Note 8: NWALT class 31-To identify pixels that were located in \"highly urban areas,\" both a changing mask of hden >500 and an unchanging urban core area were used. The urban core area consisted of an intersection of a 600-m expansion of the Developed pixels in the low-probability change mask (pixels classified continuously as Developed in the historical datasets), and a mapping of the 1990 Census Urban Areas (U.S. Department of Commerce, 2013), which was a midpoint in the NWALT dataset. All of the pixels in NWALT class 31 are, therefore, likely to have been in proximity to non-residential areas that had a permanent urban function throughout every year of the dataset (for example, an airport), or have become highly urban by virtue of having crossed the 500-hden threshold.\nNote 9: NWALT class 41: Mining/Extraction is a minor class and a small part of U.S. surface land use. The last national mapping of mining, class 32 of the NLCD 1992, comprised .0008 of the U.S. surface area (U.S. Geological Survey, 2014c). To capture this, we intersected the NLCD 2011 class 31 (\"Barren\") pixels against a mask of areas that are likely to have a mining/extraction use. The mask, created for this project, was a combination of five data sources:\na. In-house-derived polygons. As part of the manual review of this project and previous land use efforts (Falcone and Homer, 2012) , we digitized approximately 2,200 land use polygons nationally that encompassed mining, quarry, or oil/gas extraction areas. e.

These areas intersected a 2000-m buffer of EPA oil/gas point locations.\nNote 10: The Conservation Biology Institute (CBI) Protected Areas Database (PAD) data contains information about the degree of protection and conservation status for land in their database. This project used the \"GAP status\" field, which is derived from the USGS Gap Analysis Program (GAP) (U.S. Geological Survey, 2014d). Those lands in status 1 are \"most protected,\" and defined as: \"An area having permanent protection from conversion of natural land cover and a mandated management plan in operation to maintain a natural state within which disturbance events (of natural type, frequency, intensity, and legacy) are allowed to proceed without interference or are mimicked through management\" (http://gapanalysis.usgs.gov/blog/iucn-definitions). Lands in other status categories (2 or higher) are not necessarily fully protected from anthropogenic uses, although the uses may be limited. This project, therefore, used only the status 1 lands as strictly \"Conservation.\"\nNote 11: If a pixel was reclassified as Water from 2001 to 2011 in the NLCD, was part of a cluster of more than 40 contiguous water pixels, and was within 5 km of a NID 2013 dam, it was accepted as equivalent to our manually derived digitization of reservoir changes. Clusters of 40 or more contiguous Water pixels approximated our threshold of NID storage of 150 acre-feet."}, {"section_title": "Note 12:", "text": "The procedure for researching establishment dates was discussed with the CBI, which has an interest in and plans on continuing this work with additional sites in their database. The research for this project was done online. Establishment dates were in some cases simply not available, even after extensive searching (10 percent of total), and in other cases unclear because the area may have been established over multiple years from several purchases or acquisitions. In general, if it was obvious that the largest part of the area was established in a particular year, it was assigned that year. Otherwise, if multiple years were given, it was assigned the earliest year. Information was derived from multiple sources, but several were especially helpful: Wilderness. Note 15: The Census of Agriculture (CoA) data are not immune to some method changes through time. For example, from the CoA data collected by the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), there is likely an underrepresentation of some statistics because some farms are not included in the NASS's lists of farms that are sent surveys, or some farm owners do not respond to the survey (Wolfgang, 1997) . Before 1997, no adjustments were made for this. From 1997 on, these were statistically adjusted based on known complete surveys (\"Area Frame Surveys\"). However, because we do not have information on how adjustments might be made for pre-1997 data, we use them \"as is,\" which is a common practice, as far as we know. A further challenge was that a methodological change in the 2007 CoA now causes some cropland pasture to be classified as permanent pasture and range (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2014c). The amount of Total Cropland (TC) in the 2012 CoA will, therefore, typically be lower than in the 2002 CoA, even if no actual change occurred. Several methods were explored to account for or adjust this, and in these data an adjustment factor is applied as follows:\nest-crop2012 = crop2012 + (permpast2012 * 0.12), "}]
