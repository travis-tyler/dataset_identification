Official forecasts initiated and verified within 10-45N and 60-100W. 2. Official forecasts which started with at least hurricane strength. The National Weather Service's (NWS) Meteorological Development Lab (MDL), in furtherance of its mission to help protect life and property, developed the Probabilistic tropical storm Surge (P-Surge) model between 2003 and 2008 to provide storm surge inundation guidance for tropical cyclones which takes into account the uncertainty in the forecast. P-Surge utilizes a parametric wind model which uses the National Hurricane Center's (NHC) official forecast along with historic errors in its track, size, and intensity. This allows P-Surge to be consistent with NHC's message and utilize the best available parametric information as NHC's official forecast has historically outperformed other guidance. MDL overhauled the system in 2014 by introducing gridded tide calculations; providing products above ground level as well as above datum; providing products in 6-hr time ranges; and updating the computational grids to provide more accurate overland inundation guidance. MDL's latest improvements have involved: 1-hourly 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50% exceedance above datum; extending the forecast to 102 hours (from 78) and using a 24-hr (vs 20-hr) hind-cast; replacing the five retired basins in South Florida with three sub-basins of the current operational basin; creating 90% exceedance products; and providing NHC with coarser 2.5 km CONUS grids to assist with the Storm Surge Watch/Warning.

Instead, five error distributions were derived by grouping storms based on initial size and determining the historic size guidance skill in the Atlantic. Once an appropriate error distribution is chosen, it's sampled three times similarly to the Intensity errors. The result is the number of ensemble members is 3*7*X*3 where X depends on the density of the cross track sampling. The weight of each member is the product of the weight of each error sample: e.g. 0.3 * 0.14 * 0.1 * 0.4 = 0.00168"}, {"section_title": "Cross Track Error Sampling:", "text": "\u2022 Cross track samples cover 90% of the area (\u00b1 1.64 sigma) under the normal distribution assigning the 5 year mean absolute error to 0.7979 sigma. \u2022 To be dense enough, the storms were chosen to be one radius of maximum winds apart from each other at the 48 hour forecast projection.
