In this study, the item discrimination parameters of the same items across the measurement waves were not fixed. The marginal maximum likelihood (MML) approach (Bock & Aitkin, 1981;Zhang, 2012) is widely used in most MIRT packages to calibrate item parameters for the response data with multidimensional structure and estimate the correlation coefficients between abilities, including the discrimination parameters of the overlapping items. Without loss of generality, one can also standardize the latent traits of each measurement wave. In this study, the latent means of the first wave were set to zero; then, based on the EM algorithm for marginal likelihood, the latent means and variances of the other waves could also be estimated. Moreover, under this design, together with the invariant constraints for overlapping items, the model places the scale scores of different waves on the same scale; the changes of the scores across waves can be measured and compared; and the correlations between dimensions can also be estimated because the same examinees were measured across waves. Although the latent traits of three waves are not identical and measure different dimensions, as described above, this design yields comparable scores across different waves. Under this design, the MIRT growth models can be used to create a scale for measuring the changes of groups and individuals for longitudinal data, such as the NELS:88 (Millsap, 2008;Rock, 2012). In this study, the constraints imposed on the proposed MIRT model were fulfilled through its design matrix that defined a covariate structure of all the parameters in the model; the location parameters of the same items were set invariant across three waves, the latent mean and variance of the first wave were standardized, the correlations of across-wave scales were specified, and the parameters for each demographic group were designated. A methodical description of the 2PL MIRT model used in this study can be found in the \"Methodology\" section of this report. In this study, the psychometric specification of the model was also enhanced with incorporated demographic variables such as gender, race, school location, and father's and/or mother's education. The results were compared with those yielded from the Embretson models. Although growth models can be promoted by use of auxiliary variables, these models are mainly recommended for the data of low-stakes assessments such as NELS:88 for reporting group scores. When such models are applied to estimating individual scores, fairness issues can arise because, for example, a boy and girl who give identical item responses could get different scores. The software package, mirt, used in this study (Haberman, 2013) to calibrate the MIRT models employs the stabilized Newton-Raphson algorithm (Haberman, 1988). In addition, the software allows users to define their own design matrixes to build new models, including models using the incorporated demographic variables in this study. Other software packages (Cai, 2013;von Davier, 2005;Yao, 2008) for MIRT analysis are based on different algorithms, such as the expectation-maximization algorithm using MML and an approach applying the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. The report is organized as follows. The next section introduces the main conditional 2PL MIRT model and the MIRT models enhanced by incorporating auxiliary information. The third section reviews the instrument design, data collection, and the dimensionality structure of the reading assessments of NELS:88. The fourth section presents the results of the empirical analysis for different subsets of NELS:88 data, and the final section summarizes the findings.\nLet \u03c4 j be the item intercept (difficulty), and let a j be the vector with all parameters, including the parameters of slopes and the nonconstant elements of the predicting variables at different test waves of item j, 1 \u2264 j \u2264 q. The 2PL MIRT model for dichotomous item j can be expressed as where latent vector \u223cMN( (z), (z)), A is a defined matrix, z is a matrix that contains U predictors including examinee's covariate vector across waves. The model in Equation (1) provides a general framework for 2PL multidimensional IRT models (Reckase, 2009), including those making use of auxiliary information (Mislevy, 1991) and those employing algorithms that can appropriately estimate parameters and statistics of interest for complex survey data such as NELS:88 in this study. Because the latent vector is assumed to be multivariate normal, the K-dimensional latent mean and K \u00d7 Kdimensional latent covariance matrix are respectively, where is a K \u00d7 U matrix of regression parameters and \u2212 ( , z) is a K \u00d7 K positive definite matrix. The elements of are defined as where is an array with elements Haberman, 2013). The CMIRT model in Equation (1) can also be expressed as a logit model: Because the scale structure for the model is defined by a covariance matrix with the item location parameters invariant across the three waves, it is called a 2PL conditional MIRT (CMIRT) model; its scale differs from the one yielded by concurrent calibration of IRT models (Lord, 1980;Wingersky & Lord, 1984). The scale yielded by concurrent calibration can fail to account for construct shift in scale across dimensions (Patz & Yao, 2007). The 2PL CMIRT model for item j can be extended to a very general model: where \u223cMN( (z), (z)), A is a defined matrix, and (Haberman, 2013). This model is an extension of the model in Equation (1) and covers different types of items, including dichotomous and polytomous items.\nTherefore, the correlation between latent traits of waves k and k Embretson Model and Its Expansion Embretson (1991) proposed a multidimensional Rasch (1960) model for learning and change (MRMLC) by employing a Wiener simplex structure for skills to provide parameters for individual differences in changes. The Wiener simplex model (Anderson, 1960;Joreskog, 1970) is appropriate for structuring parameters in Rasch models because the properties of equivalency of measurement scales between tests and the additivity of these effects are compatible between the models. In MRMLC, Embretson postulated the involvement of M skills in item responses within K occasions, that is, measurement waves. Specifically, assume in the first wave (k = 1) that only an initial skill is involved in the item responses; assume further in later waves (k > 1) k \u2212 1 additional skills as well as the initial skill factored into examinees' skill scores (Embretson, 1991). Thus the number of skills tested increases in each wave over time. Combining these assumptions with the onedimensional Rasch model, MRMLC is given as where \u03b8 im and b j are the skill of person i at test wave m and the difficulty parameter for item j, respectively. It is worth mentioning that Embretson (1991) developed MRMLC for situations where items are not repeated across waves to avoid the well-known effects of repeated item presentation (practice effects and memory effects, among others) and local dependency among item responses. Under such situations, Equation 5tells us that for an item j observed at wave k, all tested skills up to wave k are involved. So an item observed at wave k measures k skills, including initial skill (\u03b8 i1 ) as well as k \u2212 1 modifiabilities (i.e., \u03b8 i2 , \u2026 , \u03b8 ik ). The change between condition k \u2212 1 and k is equal to the kth modifiability (\u03b8 ik ). An Embretson model can be extended and has the following form: where a j is the slope parameter (Xu & Qian, 2009). The parameters of the Embretson models in Equations (10) and (11) can be calibrated through many software packages, such as mirt and mdltm (von Davier, 2005). The results of the six ability groups reported in Xu and Qian (2009) were yielded by mdltm.\n\nThe plots in Figure 5 present the skill scores of seven demographic groups with a high/low pattern yielded by the 2PL CMIRT and CMIRT DVA. The means of all seven groups with a high/low pattern were homogeneous at the base year, ranging from 147 to 152 for the 2PL CMIRT; most of the groups experienced a 1-2 point loss in F1, except for the J. Qian  female and Hispanic groups. These students, with a high/low pattern, had outperformed other students on the test in the base-year wave. The right plot in Figure 5 shows a similar pattern for the CMIRT DVA model. All the demographic groups with a high/low pattern gained progress in the F2 wave test after 2 years in the study. Table 5 presents the results of the comparison of the average expected a posteriori (EAP) scores of the six ability pattern groups yielded by the 2PL CMIRT and Embretson models. For the sake of comparison, the EAP scores were aligned with the same target mean and standard deviation (150, 35) by a linear transformation of each set of results for CMIRT and Embretson (Xu & Qian, 2009), respectively. When the whole base-year samples (with no ability group yet classified) were transformed, the same transformation was then applied to the EAP scores of F1 and F2 for CMIRT and Embretson, respectively. Although this transformation is neither linking nor equating, it enables us to better perceive trends or patterns   Note. All expected a posteriori (EAP) mean scores are transformed by a linear transformation that sets base-year EAP distribution with mean and SD of [150,35]. 2PL = two-parameter logistic; CMIRT = conditional multidimensional item response theory; F1 = first follow-up; F2 = second follow-up.\n\nFor example, because the item with ID 1 is used in all three waves, the elements t \u03c4, 1, 1 , t \u03c4, 22, 1 , and t \u03c4, 57, 1 in T 2 \u03c4 are set to 1; because the item with ID 29 is only used once in the high-level test booklet in the second wave, t \u03c4, 45, 29 in T 2 \u03c4 is set to 1; and so on. The matrix block T 2 ad , 270 \u00d7 54, is defined for unknown slope parameters. The vectors of the slope parameters for the three waves are different, so 270 in total for 90 items. Vectors of the slope parameters are (1 0 0) \u2032 , ( 0 1 0 ) \u2032 , and ( 0 0 1 ) \u2032 for the base year, F1, and F2 assessments, respectively. For the case of the first item, (91, 55) in T 2 ad , because the item with ID 1 is used in all three waves, in T 2 ad , the elements ( t ad,91,55 t ad,92,55 t ad,93,55  and so on. The vector o 2 in the model has 369 elements with zero elements, except o 364 = o 366 = o 369 = \u2212 0.5. The block matrix T 2 \u03bb is defined for unknown predictors and quadratic terms, , with dimensions (3 + 6) \u00d7 (2 + 5). In T 2 \u03bb , O 12 and O 21 are zero matrixes: 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 In the setup of Q 2 p for the 2PL CMIRT model, the estimated \u039b 11 ( , z), in (7), is set to 1. Although the initial values of \u039b 22 ( , z) and \u039b 33 ( , z) in o 2 are also set to 1, conditioned on the F1 estimates, the values of \u039b 22 ( , z) and \u039b 33 ( , z) are updated in each iteration, and their yielded estimates are not the same as their initial values."}, {"section_title": "Methodology The Two-Parameter Logistic Multidimensional Item Response Theory Model With Use of Auxiliary Information", "text": "In this study, the 2PL MIRT model was used to fit the adaptive longitudinal assessments of NELS:88; by the NELS:88 design, all 54 items in the reading item pool were multiple-choice items. The 3PL model was not employed because, in addition to the difficulty in estimation of item parameters (Holland, 1990), a 2PL describes real test data as well as the 3PL model (Haberman, 2006a;Sinharay & Holland, 2007). The 2PL MIRT model is enhanced by incorporating demographic variables as the predictors. The MIRT model assumes that an r-dimensional latent skill vector i with elements \u03b8 ik , 1 \u2264 k \u2264 r (r = 3 for NELS:88) is associated with each examinee i at wave (or time) k. Let Y i be the response vector for each examinee i ( 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n).

Then, the weighted log-likelihood function is The stabilized Newton-Raphson algorithm is the procedure used to solve Equation (6) for MML estimation. To reduce the computational complexity, the transition matrix T and vector o are decomposed: o = T 1 o 2 , T = T 1 T 2 , and = T 1 1 . Thus the model can be simplified as where T 2 is a B 1 \u00d7 C design matrix. Therefore the main task of modeling MIRT is to define its design matrix by specifying covariates and taking account of auxiliary information. When Equation 7has been defined, the mirt program can automatically implement Equation 5; the stabilized Newton-Raphson algorithm is then used to obtain MML estimation for Equation 6 (Haberman, 2013). A partitioned T 2 provides a modular design technique that emphasizes separating the functionality in modeling. The block matrix T 2 in the appendix, provides the block design details, defining unknown location and slope parameters in T 2 \u03c4 and T 2 ad , specifying the means and covariates across waves in T 2 \u03bb , and designating auxiliary variables to the appropriate parameters in T 2 \u03bb, * .

The EAP scores, augmented based on Kelley's formula (Kelley, 1947), are regressed estimates of the true score that shrink proportionally toward the aggregate average; moreover, in mirt, the accuracy and efficiency of estimation are improved by use of the subtest score mean through methods of numerical adaptive quadrature procedure (Haberman, 2008;Haberman, 2013). Because NELS:88 is a low-stakes assessment, this study is focused on the performance of grouplevel achievement. Maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) is an alternative choice. Because it was unavailable in mirt, MLE was not chosen in studying. The conditional mean of the EAP scores, given Y i and Z i , for kth test wave is\u03b8 k = 1 n \u2211 n i=1\u03b8ki .

Based on a two-stage stratified, clusteredsample design, the base-year survey for NELS:88 was carried out during the 1988 spring semester (Spencer, Frankel, Ingels, Rasinski, & Tourangeau, 1990). A representative sample of 24,242 students was selected among eighth graders from 1,052 public and private schools. On average, 23 student participants represented each of the participating schools. The base-year study design consisted of four data components split by the role targeted individuals played in the educational system; these components were the surveying and testing of students along with the surveying of parents, school administrators, and teachers. The first follow-up study was conducted in 1990, when most of the students were high school sophomores, and included all the components in the base-year study except the parent survey. In addition, a freshened sample was added to the student component to enhance the representativeness of the sample of the nation's sophomores. A total of 21,474 students participated in the first follow-up study.  The second follow-up took place in early 1992, when most sampled students were in the second semester of their senior year. Again, a freshened sample was added in 1992 to better represent 12th graders during the spring term of the 1991-1992 school year.

To improve the measuring accuracy of the NELS:88 reading assessment, the program was designed to contain two test booklets at different difficulty levels for the second and third waves, respectively, and each participant was assigned to a booklet based on his or her performance (high/low) on the assessment of the previous wave. Therefore the examinees in the first follow-up assessment were partitioned into two ability groups (high and low); based on their base-year and F1 performances, the examinees in the second follow-up assessment were partitioned into six ability groups (high/high, high/low, high/not present, low/high, low/low, and low/not present). The item pool of the NELS:88 reading assessment comprised 54 multiple-choice items. Each booklet contained 21 items. By the NELS:88 design, some items were overlapped across the two booklets at the second and third waves; some items were also overlapped through two or three waves. Table 1 presents the number of the items overlapped across booklets from base year to F2. For example, seven and eight items were overlapped across the two booklets in the second and third wave, respectively. For further information on item overlapping, see the test item map in Rock et al. (1995). Such a design, with common items across the booklets within each wave and through different waves, guaranteed development of a scale (Kolen & Brennan, 2004;Stocking & Lord, 1983;Vale, 1986) that could measure changes over time, even though participants at different levels answered a different assortment of test questions across the measurement waves."}, {"section_title": "Dimensionality Structure of the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 Reading Assessments", "text": "In this study, the MIRT models were applied to model growth for the NELS:88 reading assessment, and the structure of the multiwave assessments was treated as multidimensional.

The results of the DETECT confirmatory analysis validated that the three waves were approximately three dimensional and that these findings were in line with the conclusions drawn by the DETECT exploratory analysis. Therefore, NELS:88 is one of the longitudinal assessments with a dimension structure appropriate for modeling growth by applying multidimensional logistic models (Embretson, 1991;Fischer & Seliger, 1997;Sijtsma, 2001).

Table 3 presents the model prediction indexes for the nine models fitted for the NELS:88 data (sample size N = 24,242), including log-likelihood, PE, GH, and AIC. The test chi-square statistic G 2 (A, B) in Equation (12) was used to compare the models. For example, in Table 3, CMIRT DVA , with all the DVs included, was compared with CMIRT DVB . Because G 2 (A, B) = 395.4 and p = 1, the model CMIRT DVA was significantly improved from CMIRT DVB . Although the structures of the models CMIRT DVB and CMIRT DVC were close, the CMIRT DVB was significantly improved from CMIRT DVC because G 2 (B, C) = 89.3 and p = 2. By comparing the DVs used in the models, it was determined that father's education and race were important predictors. The outcomes of the model selection based on different criteria, either PE, GH, or AIC, were consistent with those by the log-likelihood ratio tests. Except for 2PL CMIRT, the eight other models, from CMIRT DVA to CMIRT DVH , all made use of auxiliary information and had a better fit than the 2PL CMIRT model. Clearly, the conditional MIRT models were improved by the incorporation of background variables, analogous to the estimation procedures of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP; Allen, Donoghue, & Schoeps, 2001). Among the models, CMIRT DVA fit the data best. The nine 2PL CMIRT models can be sorted from best to worst as follows: CMIRT DVA , CMIRT DVC , CMIRT DVB , CMIRT DVF , CMIRT DVD , CMIRT DVG , CMIRT DVE , CMIRT DVH , and CMIRT. Figure 1 presents the cumulative frequency curves (CFCs) and the conditional CFCs per booklet at each score point on the frequency curves for three waves yielded by the 2PL CMIRT and 2PL CMIRT DVA , respectively. Define their deviations as the difference between CFC and the conditional CFC and the residuals as the difference between FC and the conditional FC at each score point. The patterns of the CFCs across the ability continuum, measured by EAP, were comparable with the two models; the curves shifted to the right end from base year to F1, and then to F2, which suggested growth in examinees' ability over time. On the second and third rows of Figure 1, the standardized deviations, equal to the deviation divided by the standard error at each score point, and standardized residuals, equal to the residual divided by the standard error at each score point, on the low end of the continuum were mostly larger than those on the high end, reflecting the guessing effects on the performance of examinees with low scale scores; it can also be due to memory effects on overlapping items across waves. The plots also exhibited the differences between CMIRT and CMIRT DVA models; for example, the curves of the conditional CFCs per booklet yielded by CMIRT DVA were smoother than those yielded by CMIRT. Table 4 presents the estimated correlations between latent traits among three waves for the 2PL CMIRT and 2PL CMIRT DVA , respectively. The corresponding correlations, of CMIRT and CMIRT DVA, were very close, ranging from .86 to .90. The calculations were based on Equation 9. As expected, the correlation between the traits of base year and F2 was slightly lower than the other two correlations. Figure 2 presents the Q-Q plots (Filliben, 1975) of the scale scores of base year, F1, and F2 yielded by the two models. The plots in the second row were slightly closer to the lines of the normal distribution in the Q-Q plots than the corresponding plots in the first row. Figure 3 shows the scatterplots of a pair of the score sets (base year vs. F1, base year vs. F2, J. Qian  and F1 vs. F2) for the two models. Although the patterns of the plots were compatible with the two models, the slopes of the trend lines in the scatterplots in the first row were about 1-2% smaller than those in the second row. A majority of the points in the plots were above the diagonal lines: approximately 91%, 95%, and 90% for the corresponding plots in the first row and 87%, 95%, and 90% for the plots in the second row. Evidently, most of the examinees made progress in reading over time because the scores assessed were higher in a later measurement wave in the comparisons of base year versus F1, base year versus F2, and/or F1 versus F2. Note that the progress stated here was measured by the changes of scores on the same scale for three dimensions; this did not suggest that the latent traits of the three dimensions were identical and measuring the identical ability of reading at different grades. The skill scores of seven demographic groups for six ability patterns (i.e., high/high, high/low, high/not present, low/high, low/low, and low/not present) provided comprehensive information on evaluating nine CMIRT models calibrated with the NELS:88 data. Table A1 in the appendix presents the detailed results, including the total sample yielded by the 2PL CMIRT and 2PL CMIRT DVA models. For the groups with a high/high pattern, Figure 4 presents the skill scores of seven demographic groups yielded by the 2PL CMIRT and CMIRT DVA model. In the left plot in Figure 4, the means of all seven groups with high/high pattern at base year ranged from 174 to 188; all the groups gain scores between F1 and F2, though growth rates were different. In general, the results on the right plot, yielded by the CMIRT DVA model, had a similar pattern to those yielded by the 2PL MIRT model, although the models with the use of DVs always fit the data better."}, {"section_title": "Model Comparison: Embretson Model Versus CMIRT Model", "text": "based on the transformed mean EAPs. In addition, the objective information on the student performance in the United States reported by The Nation's Report Card and other educational surveys (Allen et al., 2001;Neidorf, Binkley, Gattis, & Nohara, 2006) supports the following two facts: (a) Most or almost all groups of students between Grade 8 and Grade 12 make some progress (no stepping backward by group), and (b) the changes for the same group across two waves are not drastic or like outliers. The educational reality forms the basis to be used to judge if an outcome yielded by a model conflicts with reality. For example, in a longitudinal probability sample, it is unlikely to have a group that performs worse in Grade 12 after 4 years of studying. In Table 5, the results yielded by the CMIRT model were consistent with the educational reality we observed. Among the second ability group (high/low), some may have been classified as high level by luck by the base-year measurement and then received slightly poor skill scores in the F1 measurement. Nonetheless, these students, as a group, should have made some progress in the 12th grade. The Embretson model yielded different results. For example, in Table 5, the mean score of the second ability group (high/low) at the F2 measurement yielded by the extended Embretson model is 183.68, that is, still lower than the base-year mean of 186.05; this can also be found in the left plot in Figure 6. It seems unrealistic that a group of students failed to make any progress on the test after 4 years of study. However, the results yielded by both 2PL CMIRT models, as illustrated by the right plot in Figure 6, did not show such contradictions. Other numbers yielded by the Embretson model were difficult to explain, in particular the extreme changes of mean EAPs between two waves. For example, the students in the high/high group gained approximately 60 points between base year and F1. Considering  that the jackknifed standard error for six ability groups ranges from 4.5 to 9.0 (Qian, 2015;Wolter, 1985), such a large jump of 60 points is hard to explain."}, {"section_title": "Some Remarks on Model Comparisons", "text": "The rationale for the structure of the Embretson model in Equation 10can reveal the causes of the issues in fitting the NELS:88 data. First, as an extension of Rasch models, the Embretson (1991, p. 495) \"model specifies a Wiener simplex pattern for the involvement of initial ability and one or more modifiabilities in response potential for successive measurement occasions (waves).\" The model yields latent scales for each wave with Rasch models with comparable properties; although the latent mean and variance of the first wave are fixed, the model specifies no covariance structures across the scales of each wave. In comparison, the covariate structures between the scales for the CMIRT model are fully defined. Second, the Embretson model measures growth based on changes of item parameters for the Rasch models for each wave; additionally, the properties of the Rasch models for each wave are compatible, and the growth effects are additive. Instead, the CMIRT model measures growth by examinees' responses to items in each wave and constrains the item parameters to be invariant across the waves of the longitudinal assessment (Almond, 2011;van Rijn, Sinharay, Haberman, & Johnson, 2016). As a high quality longitudinal survey, the NELS:88 program collected data through repeated assessments using booklets at different levels assembled from the same item pool; the growth model with the constraints seems appropriate for the NELS:88 longitudinal data."}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "In this study, a conditional 2PL MIRT model was proposed to fit the three waves of the NELS:88 reading data. In the model, the IRT parameters were constrained to be invariant across the three waves, and the growth in examinee skills was measured by the progress of examinees' performance on the assessments. The design of the adaptive NELS:88 reading assessment provided a basis for modeling growth with the constraints, setting the item location parameters of the same item invariant across measurement waves. The assessment instrument, also useful for developing a scale for growth, contained a standard test booklet for the first wave and two test booklets of different difficulty levels for each of the second and third waves; furthermore, each pair of the five booklets shared common items. For discussion of item parameter invariance, see Lord (1980). In general, the results yielded by the CMIRT models provide a more reasonable explanation for the performance of different groups than those that had been yielded by the Embretson models. The empirical results yielded by the 2PL CMIRT model are consistent with the educational reality in the United States; most student groups made progress J. Qian Modeling Growth With Longitudinal Assessments in 4 years' study in schools, and the progress made across two waves was gradual, without radical changes. However, some of the results yielded by the Embretson models seem implausible. For instance, for the students in the second ability group (high/low), their mean EAP score in 12th grade was still lower than their base-year scores after 4 years' study. In addition, the students in the high/high group gained approximately 60 points between base year and eighth grade. The results also show that the growth models for longitudinal data can certainly benefit from making use of demographic variables (DVs) such as gender, race, school location, and father's education. Evaluated by the model prediction indexes of log-likelihood, PE, GH, and AIC, all the models with incorporated DVs had an improved fit over the 2PL CMIRT model without using demographic information. Among the nine models fitted, the 2PL CMIRT DVA model demonstrated the best fit of the data. In this study, the growth models for NELS:88 were improved by use of auxiliary information because NELS:88 was a low-stakes assessment and the analysis was focused on reporting group scores. However, when the goal of an assessment is to estimate individual scores, major fairness issues can arise for the models with incorporated auxiliary information because two examinees with different demographic backgrounds could get different scores, even if they give identical item responses. The mirt program offers flexibility in defining the design matrix of the covariate structure for the linear model of latent vectors. The 2PL CMIRT DVA model provides a specific example of how to specify a complex design matrix T 2 , which is expressed in a partitioned matrix, including the blocks of setting the item parameters equal across waves, defining the across-wave correlations, and designating parameters for a specific demographic group. Moreover, the stabilized Newton-Raphson algorithm provides an efficient way to calibrate the MIRT models and create a scale that measures growth at both group and individual levels. The flexibility in defining a design matrix within the efficient stabilized Newton-Raphson algorithm offers an edge over other programs based on the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm using MML and the approach employing the MCMC method. Several issues can be explored in future studies. The first one is the conditions under which the CMIRT growth models can yield valid scales in evaluating growth, such as the number of overlapping items and the size of the correlations between the latent traits across waves. Second, the growth model developed in this study, measuring changes in person-related (instead of item-related) parameters, can certainly be extended to other longitudinal assessment data, such as the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 (Ingels, Pratt, Rogers, Siegel, & Stutts, 2005). Third, the idea of including auxiliary information for inference with latent models, though not MIRT, has been supported by many educational assessments, such as NAEP (Beaton & Zwick, 1990;Mislevy, 1991) and PISA (Turner & Adams, 2007). It is certainly of interest to compare the NAEP results with those yielded by the CMIRT models with auxiliary information."}, {"section_title": "Structure of the Design Matrix for the Two-Parameter Logistic CMIRT Model With Demographic Information", "text": "In this study, to improve the accuracy of estimation, the 2PL CMIRT model has made use of auxiliary information."}, {"section_title": "Extended Block Matrix for CMIRT DVA", "text": "The structure of T 2 DVA , for the model with demographic variables incorporated (2PL CMIRT DVA ), is a 468 \u00d7 148 block matrix, that is, with (90 + 270 + 108) \u00d7 (54 + 54 + 40) dimensions.
