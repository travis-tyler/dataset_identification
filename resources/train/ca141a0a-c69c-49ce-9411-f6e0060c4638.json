Moreover, the pathology data suggests a course initiated by tauopathy contradicting the contemporary clinical view of an A\u03b2 initiated cascade.

It is widely believed that in elderly at risk for AD, reductions in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of amyloid beta 1-42 (A\u03b2 42 ), which are associated with brain amyloid deposition [1, 2] , precede elevations in CSF tau levels, a marker of neurodegeneration [3] . Support for this sequence of CSF biomarker changes comes from preclinical studies showing that lower CSF A\u03b2 42 levels predict cognitive decline [4, 5] . Others report that CSF A\u03b2 42 and tau levels configured as a ratio, are superior to univariate predictors of future impairment [1] , thus further highlighting the value of CSF A\u03b2 42 reductions. However, this clinical view of early AD lesions conflicts with the neuropathology which identifies tauopathy more commonly than A\u03b2 lesions in younger brains [6] . Moreover, adding to the uncertainty, normal aging studies have been inconsistent, showing that CSF A\u03b2 42 levels increase [7, 8] or decrease [9] , or do not change with age [10] . Offering a clue to this discrepancy, transgenic animal models show CSF A\u03b2 42 elevations occur prior to A\u03b2 42 reductions and brain deposition [11] , a trend also seen in early onset AD [12, 13] . We reasoned that these divergent human aging findings could be explained by under sampling a non-linear A\u03b2 42 trajectory with the added complexity of non-standardized cohorts. Utilizing cross-sectional (n = 766) and longitudinal data (n = 651) from three normal elderly cohorts with similar clinical and CSF protocols, we tested and confirm two major hypotheses: 1) CSF A\u03b2 42 levels have a non-linear relationship with both age and CSF biomarkers for tau pathology. We observed during mid to late-adult life, a quadratic or Ufunction uniquely and significantly described the CSF A\u03b242 relationships to age and to CSF tau levels. For CSF A\u03b238 or A\u03b240, only linear relationships were found with age and tau levels; and 2) the cross-sectional and longitudinal results confirm the hypothesis that elevated A\u03b242 levels contribute to the prediction of future cognitive decline."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Human subjects", "text": "The data were derived from three prospective and currently active longitudinal studies that sample aging subjects with normal cognition (NC). Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects. The NYU studies were approved by the NYU School of Medicine Institutional Review Board (IRB) and the ADNI and NACC studies were IRB approved by each of collaborating sites. All of the reported studies and all clinical investigations were conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki. The authors were not involved in data collection for the ADNI and NACC studies and both datasets were anonymized prior to being received by the authors. In total there were 766 subjects with LP data in the individual cohort studies. Of those, 651 subjects had a clinical follow-up and were included in the combined cross-sectional and prediction studies of cognitive outcome. For the prediction study, 573 subjects retained the clinical diagnosis of normal (Stable NC) at their last clinical follow-up evaluation and 78 demonstrated future cognitive decline consistent with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD (Fig 1) . A second prediction analysis was done with a subset of the Stable NC and Future MCI/AD groups matched 1:1. The matched subjects were selected by having an exact match of a Stable NC subject to a Future MCI/AD subject in terms of cohort, sex, ApoE4 status, race (Caucasion or non-Caucasian), baseline age split at 75y (<75y or >75y); as well as matching age within 5 years, years of education within 2 years, and follow-up time within 2 years. Exact sampling was done without replacement, and for 23 decliners no available matching control was found. Consequently, we examined 55 Future MCI/AD and 55 matching Stable NC. The NYU cohort of community dwelling volunteers (n = 331), included n = 230 with a clinical follow-up. These data were derived from NIH supported RO1 aging studies between 1997 and 2016 (MdeL, Principal Investigator). All subjects received a standard protocol consisting of medical, neurological, psychiatric, neuropsychological testing, clinical laboratory, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations, and lumbar puncture (LP). The primary goal of the NYU studies was to examine CSF biomarkers and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) predictors of cognitive impairment in aging.\nThe second cohort (n = 335, including n = 326 with a clinical follow-up) was enrolled in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu). The ADNI was launched in 2003 as a public-private partnership, led by Principal Investigator Michael W. Weiner, MD. The primary goal of ADNI has been to use serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), fluid biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment to describe and predict progressive cognitive impairment as related to Alzheimer's disease (AD). For up-to-date information, see www.adni-info.org.\nThe third cohort (n = 100, including n = 95 with a clinical follow-up) was derived from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC). NACC was established by the NIH National Institute on Aging (NIA) in 1999 to facilitate collaborative research across Alzheimer's Disease Centers (ADC). NACC has developed and maintains a large relational database of standardized clinical and neuropathological research data in partnership with the Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium and the National Cell Repository for Alzheimer's Disease. Of four participating NACC sites, data from only one site was selected. One dropped site had only two cognitively normal subjects and two dropped sites did not provide batch adjustments for the CSF values. Further, to avoid any possible overlap, three NACC subjects from the selected site that matched the ADNI data by year and month of birth, sex, education and APOE \u03b54 carrier status, were removed from the NACC data set.

In brief, CSF Amyloid beta (A\u03b2 42 ) levels and Total tau (T-tau) were measured using a standard ELISA protocol (Innotest1, Innogenetics, Ghent, Belgium). An Innogenetics sandwich ELISA assay was used to detect tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (P-tau181). In this assay a phospho-dependent capture antibody, AT270 (P176PAPKTpP132), and a human specific tau detection antibody, HT7 (P159PGQK163), were utilized [18] . Batch wise rescaling of A\u03b2 42 was performed using linear regression with a single reference batch of 236 NC subjects. For a subset of 233 NYU subjects, the A\u03b2 42, A\u03b2 38, and A\u03b2 40 levels were additionally examined with the MSD Abeta Triplex (Meso Scale Discovery, Rockville, Maryland). All assays were conducted at the Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Sweden by board-certified laboratory technicians who were blinded to clinical data. The procedures used by ADNI for assay technology, validation, quality control and adjustments for batch variations are found online in the ADNI data primer for CSF analyses (http:// adni.info.org/). Briefly, the CSF AD biomarkers A\u03b2 42, P-tau181 and T-tau were measured on the multiplex xMAP Luminex platform (Luminex Corp, Austin, TX) with Innogenetics immunoassay kit-based reagents (INNO-BIA AlzBio3, Ghent, Belgium [19] ). The biomarker data file (UPENNBIOMK_MASTER.csv) was downloaded from the ADNI website on January 2017.\nUnlike NYU and ADNI, the published NACC reports do not state CSF collection methods. However, the included NACC site used an ELISA analytic protocol similar to the method used at NYU with all provided data assayed in one batch. When referring to P-tau181 and T-tau collectively, we use the term X-tau; and when referring to multiple A\u03b2 fragments we use A\u03b2 xx ."}, {"section_title": "Statistical analyses", "text": "Demographic differences between cohorts and Outcome Group were assessed using ANOVA with Tukey post hoc correction for pairwise comparisons for continuous variables. Chi-square tests with Bonferroni correction for pairwise comparisons were used to test nominal variables for group differences. The standard confounds of age, sex and ApoE4 status were added to all statistical models as covariates with the exception of models with demographically matched outcome groups.\nWe observed in the individual cohort scatterplots that both high and low levels A\u03b2 42 were associated high Tau levels. From this observation we hypothesized that a quadratic fit of A\u03b2 42 would explain more of the variance in the Tau measures than the linear fit of A\u03b2 42 alone. Linear regression models, with the T-Tau and P-Tau181 measures as dependent variables, were used to test this hypothesis. The linear A\u03b2 42 term followed by the quadratic A\u03b2 42 term (A\u03b2   2   ) were added consecutively to test the incremental change in the model with the standard confounds. To account for possible heteroscedasticity of the estimators, robust (Huber-White) sandwich estimators were used to estimate the standard errors. Sensitivity analysis was performed using all available subjects with normal cognition at their baseline LP (no exclusions) from each cohort.\nTo have sufficient power to investigate possible interaction effects and the relationship of A\u03b2 2 with future cognitive decline, subjects with follow-up clinical data from the three cohorts were combined and analyzed using Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE). The GEE allowed us to account for possible clustering of subjects within cohorts. We assumed an unstructured correlation matrix in all GEE models with cohort included as a within-subjects effect. The GEE models were analyzed first on the raw biomarker values. However, since the cohorts used different assays, the scale of the raw values were different for each cohort making graphing and the interpretation of model coefficients problematic. For this reason, z scores for each cohort were calculated using the mean and standard deviation from the raw biomarker values. The results are reported and graphed using the z scores.\nThe X-Tau measures were examined as the dependent variables with the identity link function in the GEE, with the standard covariates, A\u03b2 42 , A\u03b2 2 , and the interactions of the standard confounds with A\u03b2 42 and A\u03b2 2 . In the presence of significant interaction terms, the data was subdivided and reanalyzed to explore the interaction.\nWe hypothesized that both high and low A\u03b2 42 were associated with future cognitive decline and that this effect would be stronger in younger subjects. To test this hypothesis we used the GEE with the logit link and Outcome group as a binary dependent variable. All analyses were checked for violations of the model assumptions and any conflicts are reported. The Box Cox transformation procedure [20] was used to determine the most appropriate power transformation to reconfigure values to a normal distribution. Differences in variances were tested using Levene's Test for Equality of Variances. All variables were centered for the calculation of higher order terms to avoid multicollinearity with the main effects. For all results, statistical significance was defined as a two-sided p-value of less than 5%.

In other words, with increasing age there are increased numbers of subjects with high and low CSF A\u03b2 42 levels. Since older age, low CSF A\u03b2 42 , and high tau levels are associated with a greater risk of AD, these changes in the variance of A\u03b2 42 suggested that both high and low A\u03b2 42 values could be associated with future decline.

Splitting the full sample at the median age of the decline group (75y) and fixing the specificity at 75%, we found that in the younger group (stable NC n = 434 vs. Future MCI/AD n = 39) the quadratic A\u03b2 42 has the greater sensitivity (72%) compared to the linear A\u03b2 42 term (sensitivity = 61%).

However, the quadratic (A\u03b2 2 ) term was a significant predictor of outcome group (Wald Chi square = 5.9, OR = 1.6, p < .05).

MSD analyses: The relationships between A\u03b2 42, A\u03b2 38, and A\u03b2 40 with age and X-tau\nAs the relationship between A\u03b2 42 to age and to X-tau can be affected by brain A\u03b2 deposition, we also examined A\u03b2 38 and A\u03b2 40 which like A\u03b2 42 are sensitive to production but unlike A\u03b2 42, are known to have minimal brain accumulations [22] . We observed that A\u03b2 38 and A\u03b2 40 had strong positive linear relationships with age: (R 2 change = 5%, F change = 11.0, p < .01 and R 2 change = 5%, F change = 13.2, p < .01, respectively), whereas A\u03b2 42 did not show a significant linear age effect (replicating the finding for the total sample). Both A\u03b2 38 and A\u03b2 40 show strong positive linear effects with X-tau. This is clearly seen for Ttau, (R 2 change = 35%, F change = 147, p < .01, and R 2 change = 31%, F change = 118, p < .01, respectively), as well as for P-tau181, (R 2 change = 40%, F change = 168, p < .01, and R 2 change = 35%, F change = 135, p < .01, respectively, Fig 4) .

We observed a U-function, such that both higher and lower levels of A\u03b2 42 were associated with increasing X-tau levels. This effect was observed in three independent subject cohorts and for each age quartile ranging from 45-90 years. Only linear effects were found for either A\u03b2 38 or A\u03b2 40 with respect to X-Tau levels. Most importantly, we observed the quadratic A\u03b2 42 term (A\u03b2 2 ) was superior to the linear A\u03b2 42 term as a predictor of future clinical decline, an effect most pronounced in younger subjects. Three important observations were made in this study, all centered on the non-linearity of the A\u03b2 42 level.\nFirst, both elevations and reductions in the CSF A\u03b2 42 level are associated with increased CSF levels of P-tau181 and T-tau, known biomarkers markers of brain degeneration. These data suggest that Braak's observation that in aging, tau pathology precedes A\u03b2 42 pathology [6] , may be under appreciated. CSF biomarker studies that rely on decreased CSF A\u03b2 42 levels to identify brain amyloid sequestration and mark the onset of preclinical AD [23] will have missed an earlier stage of elevated A\u03b2 42 also accompanied by elevated tau levels. Our data suggest that the use of ratio approaches to identify subjects at risk for AD are not optimal as individuals with higher A\u03b2 42 levels would not be identified as at increased risk. Specifically, we observed that in subjects under 75y, adding the quadratic term to the prediction model significantly increased the model from an accuracy of 61% to 72%. For subjects older than 75y, neither the linear nor the quadratic terms predicted outcome. Of the 78 the Future MCI/AD group, there were 5 subjects (3 from ADNI and 2 from NYU) with a non-AD diagnosis (2 with Parkinson's, 2 with cortical basal degeneration and 1 with undetermined etiology) at their last visit (1.3 to 6 years after baseline). Removal of these subjects did not affect the quadratic prediction model, and further, none of these 5 subjects had extreme A\u03b2 42 values. Rather, their z scores ranged from -1.6 to 1.1 and their mean (z = -.43) did not differ from the mean of the rest of the Future MCI/AD group (z = -.29). We therefore conclude that the quadratic A\u03b2 42 measure is a predictor of MCI/AD outcome.\nFurther, the impact of ignoring the quadratic relationship could also be compounded in a longitudinal design where normal appearing levels may follow elevations. Should CSF A\u03b2 42 levels first rise and subsequently fall in the preclinical stages of AD, a subject could have presumably normal appearing A\u03b2 42 levels twice, complicating diagnostic examinations and the assessment of A\u03b2 42 positivity often used in clinical prevention trials. Temporal evidence in support of the view that A\u03b2 42 elevations precede brain A\u03b2 42 depositions comes from murine models for AD [11] . To a very limited extent, trends exist in the presenile dementias [12, 13] .\nTo address this concern, we examined two longitudinal CSF data points for subjects who maintained normal cognition over 18 to 36 months. On the third clinical exam within 9 years of baseline, we identified decliners and non-decliners. The longitudinal CSF A\u03b2 42 data revealed a polarization of A\u03b2 42 levels for \u03b54 negative decliners (Fig 5) . Specifically, the annual percentile A\u03b2 42 ranking for non-carrier decliners moved to the extremes of the distribution showing either excessive increases or decreases in the longitudinal A\u03b2 42 levels compared to the nondecliners. This effect was not observed in \u03b54 carriers. We also examined 18 subjects in the NYU cohort with three or more LP's studied over 6-10 years. We did not observe for any subject evidence for CSF A\u03b2 42 elevations followed by A\u03b2 42 reductions. Presumably, the time course for AD is long and based on our cross-sectional observations, elevations are likely to have peaked years prior to the dementia transition period under surveillance. We conclude that the temporal course of tau and A\u03b2 42 deposition in brain with respect to the CSF levels remains largely unknown and that longitudinal observations on younger subjects are needed to definitively establish that CSF A\u03b2 42 level elevations occur in advance of cognitive decline, before CSF A\u03b2 42 level decreases, and in advance of brain A\u03b2 deposits.\nIt is worth briefly speculating that abnormal CSF clearance of CSF could affect the CSF analyte levels. It is increasingly apparent from animal studies that differential cross membrane transport properties, enzymatic degradation, molecular size, and brain glymphatic physiology contribute to the production and clearance of A\u03b2 42 to the CSF [24] . While human studies have demonstrated reduced A\u03b2 42 clearance to the CSF [25] and that reduced CSF A\u03b2 42 levels are associated with brain A\u03b2 depositions [1, 2] , it remains to be shown in humans that prior to brain deposition, CSF clearance is reduced and CSF A\u03b2 xx levels and X-Tau levels are elevated. Such reduced CSF clearance could potentially predict vulnerability to brain amyloid lesions and even tau aggregation. Recently, we reported using PET, a reduced CSF clearance in AD associated with elevated brain amyloid [26] . Others have shown this relationship in murine AD models [27] . Indirect evidence in support of a generalized clearance defect comes from our data showing strong linear relationships between X-Tau and both A\u03b2 38 and A\u03b2 40 , as these A\u03b2 fragments do not demonstrate appreciable brain depositions [22] . Second, we observed that over the 45 year age span examined, the mean CSF A\u03b2 42 was not associated with age. Rather we observed an increased age associated variance that produced both high and low A\u03b2 42 values. On the other hand, A\u03b2 40, A\u03b2 38, and X-tau were significantly and positively age associated. This result is consistent with one prior cross-sectional aging study that also examined a broad age range (47-84y) and similarly observed that the younger subjects (47-62y) showed a positive correlation between age and A\u03b2 42 levels, whereas the older subjects showed a negative correlation [8] . Other studies that examined subjects of advanced age reported either no changes in A\u03b2 42 [28, 29] or reductions with age [30] .\nWe offer that our broad age range, large sample size, and standardized clinical exams supports our explanation invoking a non-linear U-shaped quadratic function in the relationship of A\u03b2xx with age and X-tau pathology. We observed a quadratic fit between A\u03b2 42 and X-tau in each age quartile examined. However, the linear direction of the relationships changed from positive to negative with increasing age. Specifically, in the in the two younger age quartiles (between 45 and 70y), we observed a positive linear association between A\u03b2 42 and tau and in the two older quartiles (between 70 and 90y) we observed that both the variance of A\u03b2 42 increased and the slopes with age became negative. Overall, our results suggest that with increasing age, A\u03b2 42 increases with X-tau up until a point where A\u03b2 42 is either bound in plaques [11, 31] or its activity dependent production is decreased [32] . However, as this effect is not found for other A\u03b2 fragments which show consistent age dependent elevations, as others have concluded it points towards an A\u03b2 42 deposition effect. We for the first time demonstrate in our longitudinal study that this nonlinear A\u03b2 42 trajectory identifies subjects at risk for cognitive decline.\nThird, our CSF biomarker predictions of clinical outcome only partially agree with prior findings of an increased risk of cognitive decline associated with elevations in the X-tau to A\u03b2 42 ratio [33] . Our results demonstrate a new finding, an added risk associated with elevated CSF A\u03b242 levels, the contribution of the A\u03b2 2 term to the prediction. Specifically, Fagan et al first reported that only by combining baseline CSF P-tau181 and A\u03b2 42 in a ratio were prediction effects seen for the transition from CDR = 0 to CDR >0.5 [31] . Similarly, others showed that a lower A\u03b2 42 levels and higher P-tau181 levels best predicted future MCI/AD [34, 35] . However, univariate CSF A\u03b2 42 measures have not previously been shown to be predictive of cognitive decline. Consequently, our observation that a quadratic A\u03b2 42 measure, one that considers both elevated and reduced levels as significant predictors is novel. This result is likely due to the added power of the large combined sample examining both younger and older decliners, and for the first time, the inclusion of A\u03b2 42 elevations in the prediction models. We caution that the quadratic approach has not been applied to the transition between mild cognitive impairment and AD. Overall, our results suggest that elevated tau is necessary for the prediction of cognitive decline across all age groups. However, in younger subjects considering A\u03b2 42 elevations is very important as the cumulative evidence suggests A\u03b2 42 elevations are followed by reductions. Future imaging studies are needed to examine the relationship between elevations in CSF A\u03b2 42 and tau levels and brain depositions of these proteins. It is currently believed that CSF A\u03b2 42 levels drop with brain aggregation but the antecedent relationship of elevations in the A\u03b2 42 levels to brain deposition is unknown, but for one animal study [11] . Moreover, PET imaging data have yet to be reported for longitudinal CSF Tau level changes. Our CSF data are consistent with the view that CSF Tau and CSF A\u03b2 42 elevations precede CSF A\u03b2 42 reductions. This finding is not readily translatable to results from post mortem lesion staging that suggest an earlier tau deposition [6] but they do appear to conflict with formulations suggesting that initial CSF A\u03b2 42 reductions drive the AD cascade in late onset AD [36] .\nIn summary, we observed that quadratic relationships between A\u03b2 42 and tau were consistently found across age quartiles in three independent normal aging cohorts. Most importantly, the quadratic (A\u03b2 42 ) 2 term improves on the linear A\u03b2 42 in the prediction of future cognitive decline. The data suggest that the A\u03b2 2 term affords an earlier recognition of risk, especially in younger subjects. Overall, our findings support the hypothesis that both high and low A\u03b2 42 levels are associated with elevated Tau levels, and mark the earliest known risk stage for cognitive impairment related to preclinical AD. This observation may prove to be valuable in future secondary prevention trials. Further longitudinal imaging studies are needed to examine the non-linear time course of CSF A\u03b2 42 and brain lesion deposition.\nFormal analysis: Elizabeth Pirraglia. "}]
