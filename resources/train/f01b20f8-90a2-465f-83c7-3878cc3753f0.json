DESIGN: US population-based longitudinal cohort study SETTING: Data were drawn from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), which measured cognitive performance repeatedly every 2 years over 18 years (1996)(1997)(1998)(1999)(2000)(2001)(2002)(2003)(2004)(2005)(2006)(2007)(2008)(2009)(2010)(2011)(2012)(2013)(2014). PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged 50 and older who who took part in a minimum of 3 waves of the HRS and used hearing aids for the first time between Waves 4 and 11 (N52,040). MEASUREMENTS: Cognitive outcomes were based on episodic memory scores determined according to the sum of immediate and delayed recall of 10 words. RESULTS: Hearing aid use was positively associated with episodic memory scores (b51.53, p<.001). Decline in episodic memory scores was slower after (b5-0.02, p<.001) than before using hearing aids (b5-0.1, p<.001). These results were robust to adjustment for multiple confounders and to attrition, as accounted for using a joint model.

The HRS is an ongoing biennial investigation of U.S. adults aged 50 and older that started in 1992. Sponsored by the National Institute of Aging and performed by the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan, the HRS provides information on demographic and socioeconomic factors and health.\nWe used Wave 3 and later of the HRS because the episodic memory scores using 10 words were first available in the Wave 3. We restricted the sample to respondents aged 50 and older who responded to at least 3 waves of the HRS, had no dementia in the baseline, and used hearing aids for the first time between Waves 4 and 11. This gave a sample of 2,040 individuals, with the selection procedure as illustrated in Figure 1 . We describe the characteristics of the HRS core sample from Waves 3 to 12, the HRS core sample with at least 3 observations, and the final sample in Supplementary Table S1 , which shows that the average age and episodic memory scores of the core sample from Waves 3 to 12 and the final sample are similar."}, {"section_title": "Measures", "text": "The measures of cognitive ability in the HRS are the outcomes of simple tests (e.g., immediate and delayed word recall (episodic memory), serial 7's, backward count starting from 20, and date naming). In our analysis, we focused on 1 cognitive domain available in all HRS waves used in this study: episodic memory. We were particularly interested in episodic memory scores because they are more age sensitive than other cognitive measures, 18 do not experience floor or ceiling effects, 19 have a mechanism in common with cognitive control variables, 13 and have a strong association with dementia. After allowing for established risk factors for dementia, the odds of dementia in members of the reference (disadvantaged) trajectory were 5 times as high as in those in the most advantaged trajectory of episodic memory. 20 In the HRS memory test, the interviewer read a list of 10 simple nouns (e.g., book, child, hotel) once, and participants were asked to repeat those nouns immediately after the words were read (immediate recall) and after a short interval (delayed recall). We calculated the episodic memory score as the sum of the number of target words recalled at the immediate and the delayed recall phase (range 0-20). 19 When hearing aids were used for the first time was based on participants' response to the question: \"Do you ever wear a hearing aid?\" Based on the first time that a respondent answered yes to that question, we constructed a dummy variable for hearing aid use (1 for the wave the first time the respondents used hearing aids and after, 0 for the wave before the respondents used hearing aids). In total, 2,260 respondents used hearing aids for the first time during the 14-year period.\nWe included an extensive set of covariates identified as risk factors for cognitive decline in prior studies. [21] [22] [23] [24] Demographic covariates included age and sex. Socioeconomic covariates included education (<high school, high school, college), marital status (married or cohabiting, not married), and wealth (tertiles of income each wave). The lifestyle behavior covariates included smoking, drinking, and physical activities. For smoking, respondents were classified as nonsmokers, past smokers, and current smokers. We used number of units per week to measure drinking behavior. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the 8-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. 25 Number of comorbidities was included as the sum of several chronic diseases: heart disease, high blood pressure, lung diseases, diabetes mellitus, stroke, and cancer."}, {"section_title": "Statistical analysis", "text": "To model trajectories in episodic memory scores, we used hierarchical linear regression analysis, which is designed for the analysis of longitudinal data. In this regression analysis, intra-individual correlation was modelled using an individual-specific random intercept and an individualspecific random slope. This analysis thus takes into account multiple observations within individual and intra-individual correlation. In addition, it allows for adjustment of potential confounding variables. We used a spline model with a knot at the beginning of hearing aid use and assessed whether the slope before using hearing aid differed from the slope after hearing aid use. We included the hearing aid variable (coded as 1 after using a hearing aid and 0 before using a hearing aid) and its interaction with the slope term (age) to test the differences in cognitive trajectories before and after beginning to use a hearing aid. The associations between hearing aid use, age, age interaction with hearing aid use, and episodic memory scores were quantified in the first model. Demographic and socioeconomic determinants (age, sex, education, marital status, wealth) and the variables representing lifestyle behavior, depression, and number of chronic diseases were added in the final model."}, {"section_title": "Sensitivity analysis", "text": "For the first sensitivity analysis, we conducted 2 separate hierarchical linear regression analyses with immediate and delayed word recall as the outcomes; the second analysis focused on attrition. The HRS, like other longitudinal studies on aging, is subject to attrition, in which respondents are prone to selective dropout due to death or poor health. 26, 27 Ignoring those dropouts can result in bias in the analysis. We tested the sensitivity of our results to attrition by using a joint model. 28 This resultant division into 2 parts, the growth curve model and the survival model, allowed the random effects to influence episodic memory and attrition. Finally, we examined the role of sex in the association between hearing aid use and cognitive function by conducting separate analyses for women and men. The models were constructed using Stata version 14 (Stata Corp., College Station, TX) and Latent Gold 5.1 (Statistical Innovations, Belmont, MA). Table 1 shows the descriptive statistics of 2,040 HRS sample respondents who used hearing aids for the first time between Waves 4 and 11 at the first wave observed. The episodic memory score has a distribution close to the normal distribution, with a sample mean of 10.4 and a standard deviation of 3.2. On average, respondents used hearing aids for the first time at 62 years old. Sixty-one percent of respondents were male, 45% had completed college or higher, and 81% were married. The bivariate regression model (Table 1 , second and third columns) shows that age, depression score, and number of comorbidities have a significant association with episodic memory scores. Being relatively well educated, drinking alcohol, and engaging regularly in physical activities are positively associated with episodic memory scores."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": "The parameter estimates for the slope of episodic memory scores before and after beginning to use hearing aids in an initial model are presented in Table 2 . Episodic memory declined significantly with the addition of age, but the rate of the decline was slower after beginning to use hearing aids (b5-0.03, p<.001) than before (b5-0.11, p<.001). The difference in the coefficient between those two slopes is 0.08 (p<.001). In this model, hearing aid use was associated with higher memory scores (b52.13, p<.001). The association between hearing aid use and episodic memory scores remained significant when we included the risk factors in the second model (b51.53, p<.001). In this second model, slopes for the decline of episodic memory scores were steeper before beginning hearing aid use (b5-0.1, p<.001) than after (b5-0.02, p<.001).\nIn the second model, there were significant associations between several potential confounders and sociodemographic characteristics and episodic memory scores. Being female, having attained a higher level of education, having a higher income, drinking alcohol, and engaging in regular physical exercise were positively associated with episodic memory scores. Depression scores and chronic diseases were associated with lower memory scores. Figure 2 illustrates change in episodic memory scores over time. The graph is centered at the first time an individual used hearing aids. The lines to the left of the center of the graph show the rate of change in episodic memory score in the years leading up to beginning hearing aid use, and the lines to the right of the center of the graph show the rate of change in episodic memory after the beginning of hearing aid use. The model is adjusted for demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, lifestyle behavior, and health status. For all individuals, there is a decline in episodic memory leading up to hearing aid use. Episodic memory scores continue to decline after beginning to use hearing aids, but the rate of decline is less steep.\nThe first sensitivity analysis shows that immediate and delayed word recall scores declined significantly before using hearing aids and that this significant decline diminished after beginning to use hearing aids (Supplementary Table S2 , Supplementary Figure S1 ). For the second sensitivity analysis (Supplementary Table S3 , Supplementary Figure S2) , the slope of cognitive decline before and after beginning to use hearing aids in the joint model is similar to that in the growth curve model, indicating that our findings are robust. Our final sensitivity analysis showed that, although women performed better than men on the episodic memory test, they had similar rates of cognitive decline before and after using hearing aids for the first time (Supplementary Table S4 , Supplementary Figure S3 ). "}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "Using a national representative survey spanning 18 years, our study shows a less steep decrease in episodic memory performance after beginning to use hearing aids than before using hearing aids. The slower rate of decline after beginning hearing aid use remained significant after taking attrition into account. From the theoretical point of view, this finding provides new evidence to disentangle the relationship between cognitive function and hearing impairment. In prior studies, 2 main hypotheses were posited to explain this relationship. The common cause hypothesis posits that hearing impairment and cognitive decline share common age-related change factors such as degeneration of the central nervous system. 29, 30 The cascade hypothesis claims that prolonged reduction in hearing function leads to insufficient stimulation, which may cause cognitive decline in later life. 7, 14, 31, 32 These hypotheses lead to different predictions regarding the effect of hearing aid use on cognition. According to the common cause hypothesis, hearing aids may not affect cognition given that degeneration of central nervous system affects cognitive function regardless of maintenance of good hearing.\nThe slower rate of cognitive decline in those with hearing impairment who have begun using a hearing aid supports the cascade hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, hearing aids may allow better hearing input and delay cognitive decline by preventing the adverse effects of auditory deprivation or facilitating lower levels of depression symptoms, greater social engagement, and higher selfefficacy, which protect cognitive function. Prior studies have reported that hearing aid users experience less anxiety and depression 33, 34 and have better-quality social engagement after beginning to use hearing aids; lack of social engagement and depression are independently associated with cognitive decline. [36] [37] [38] Another mechanism through which hearing aids may reduce the rate of cognitive decline is by enhancing self-efficacy, the belief in one's ability to accomplish tasks or succeed in specific situations, 39 which in turn improves scores on cognitive tests and memory function. 40, 41 Further research is needed to confirm the mechanism by which hearing aid use affects rate of cognitive decline in later life.\nThe strengths of this study lie in its long-term followup, which may have allowed a longer time for the accumulation of the benefits of hearing aid use to appear, although the longer follow-up period also introduced greater individual differences that may have influenced cognitive function because of the effects of aging and disease. In addition, the population-based nature of the HRS sample makes the results of the study generalizable and enhances their external validity. Our findings could thus have substantial public health implications, especially due to the large prevalence of age-related hearing impairment and poor hearing aid aid uptake among those with hearing impairment. Approximately one-third of U.S. adults aged 50 and older with hearing impairment 42 and 40% of those with moderate hearing impairment use hearing aids. 43 A report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine found that many individuals with hearing impairment do not seek or receive hearing health care, mainly because of their lack of awareness of hearing impairment, limited accessibility of the care, and high costs for hearing technologies. It recommended a set of actions to improve accessibility and affordability of hearing health care, including strengthen hearing healthcare promotion and provide access to care of poor people. 44 Our findings support the proposition that timing of beginning hearing aid use is crucial for the success of hearing aids as an intervention in old age. 45 Hearing impairment has been found to be the most prominent midlife risk factor for dementia, 3 with 55 being the youngest average age at which hearing impairment was shown to be associated with risk of dementia. 46 Preventing hearing loss, screening individuals for hearing function, and providing hearing aids may preserve cognitive function in older age.\nAn important limitation of our study is that hearing aid use was identified based on individuals reporting whether they ever wear hearing aids. No information on frequency of use, adequacy of amplification, or satisfaction with hearing aids was available. Up to 40% of hearing aids dispensed are never or rarely used. 47 Differing durations and extents of rehabilitative procedures may also lead to different effects on cognitive function. These differences may mask the magnitude of the effect of hearing aid use on cognitive function in this study. Because there is high interindividual variability in hearing aid use, future studies should consider this factor in their models. Another limitation of our study was that the episodic memory tests in the HRS were all presented orally, and better hearing may facilitate better performance on those tests, but our analysis of the visually presented letter cancellation test available in the English Longitudinal Study on Ageing Wave 5 shows that respondents with hearing impairment perform worse than those with no impairment (Supplementary Table S5 ).\nIn sum, we observed a slower decline in episodic memory performance in HRS participants with hearing impairment after they began to use hearing aids. This association was shown to be independent of risk factors for cognitive impairment and remained significant when Figure 2 .

Public health efforts to increase access to quality hearing health care might delay the onset of cognitive impairment and prove a successful preventive intervention to reduce the impending dementia epidemic."}, {"section_title": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "The SENSE-Cog WP1 group are Geir Bertelsen, 1,2 Suzanne Cosh, 3 Audrey Cougnard-Gr egoire, 3 C ecile Delcourt, 3 Fofi Constantinidou, 4 Catherine Helmer, 3 M.
