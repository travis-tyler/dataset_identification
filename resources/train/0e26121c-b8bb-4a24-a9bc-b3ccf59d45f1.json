[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "As of 4 June 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 virus had infected over 1.9 million people in the United States and >6 million worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus recently identified as the causative agent of COVID-19. To understand the genetic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, human samples from different countries have been sequenced [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . These analyses found 60-96% status was not statistically associated with hospitalization status. Thus, one major challenge is to develop a genetic comparative method independent from unclear ancestors of SARS-CoV-2. The second challenge is to associate sequencing mechanism with the incidence and mortality of COVID-19.\nTo address these challenges, we used the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) and identified local sequencing similarities among the SARS-CoV-2 genomes ( Figure 1A ). For the first time, our novel analyses showed a strong statistical association of the uneven local genomic similarity mapping with the incidence and mortality of COVID-19. Furthermore, our findings in the receptor-binding domain (RBD)/receptor-binding motif (RBM) of spike (S) protein reveal, for the first time, the possible genomic mechanism causing the diverse COVID-19 incidence and mortality."}, {"section_title": "Results and discussion", "text": "We collected all available raw sequencing data for SARS-CoV-2 from the four sequencing platforms (Illumina, BGI, Ion-Torrent and Nanopore) deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Short Reads Archive (SRA) database as of 15 April 2020 (Supplementary Table S1 ). BLAST alignments were implemented between the raw sequencing data of SARS-CoV-2, and the assembled genomes in the NCBI Betacoronavirus database and our customized SARS-CoV-2 database ( Figure 1A ). The total sequencing read number from 32 data sets in the four sequencing platforms is 1,584,295,725. To ensure the data quality while searching for local sequence similarity, we used the Q30 ratio-the percentage of bases in a read with a Phred score [16] or called Q score >30. The 95% percentile of Q30 ratios of all reads in a sequenced sample is the threshold for the high-quality reads used for BLAST alignments. Thus, we set the Q30 ratio as 0.9 for Illumina and BGI platforms and 0.2 for Ion-Torrent and Nanopore platforms ( Figure 1B ). Our sequencing analysis strategy is distinct from the most existing methods considering the assembled genomes only (one virus one sequence). The utility of highquality sequencing raw data (from total of 1,584,295,725) into our analysis ensured the searching of the similarities by local genomic regions and the statistical requirements for genetic comparative analyses.\nFirstly, we identified the uneven distribution of the local genomic similarities among the SARS-CoV-2 viruses and its strong association with the incidence and mortality of the illness. We defined two quantitative metrics to facilitate the comparison of the BLAST results across the genomes in the considered coronavirus databases. The BLAST hit score (BHS) is a metric based on the similarity between a high-quality read of a SARS-CoV-2 sample and each assembled genome in the coronavirus databases (Methods). BHS evaluates the similarity of two SARS-CoV-2 viruses by examining the local genomic regions (Methods) . Surprisingly, we found that BHS is not evenly disxtributed but dominated by viruses from certain countries ( Figure 2, Supplementary Figure S1 ), notably Spain and the United States. The geographic information was derived from target data sets with the assembled genomes. The results were consistent in analyses using the NCBI Betacoronavirus database and our customized SARS-CoV-2 genome database (Supplementary Figure S1 ). Another hit score, BLAST total hit score (BTHS), was also defined, evaluating which viruses categorized by geographic regions or the existing coronaviruses are more likely to have high values of BHS in the BLAST alignments (Methods). BTHS excluded bat and pangolin coronaviruses for the similarity analysis because of the low number of hits (Supplementary Figure S2 ). The BTHS values were strongly correlated to the incidence and mortality of illness in those countries caused by SARS-CoV-2 viruses (Figure 3 , Supplementary Table S2, infection cases: r = 0.468, P = 0.009 and deaths: r = 0.455, P = 0.01, Pearson's product-moment correlation).\nSecondly, we explored why the local genomes of the viruses with high BTHS show the uneven similarity distribution and which genomic regions are crucial for these viruses that may lead to the distinct infection incidence and mortality in different countries. Using the sample collection dates (Supplementary  Table S3 ), we identified that BHS scores of early outbreak samples from China and the United States show a significant difference from other samples. BHS scores displayed two clusters, 4I.C1 and 4I.C2 ( Figure 4A Growing evidence showed that the SARS-CoV-2 S protein plays the most important role in viral attachment, fusion and entry and is a target for the development of antibodies, entry inhibitors and vaccines [1, [17] [18] [19] [20] .\nThirdly, we tested if the viruses in the 4I.C1 and 4I.C2 have specific genome sequences that determine the alignments in SARS-CoV-2-RBD. 4I.C1 does not have any hits with 100% match in the RBD region of S protein, indicating mismatches in the alignments ( Figure 4B , right panel). We reduced the match from 100 to 97.5% and identified a few hits that fall in the RBD region including gaps. As an instance, 4I.C1 includes an alignment of 99.4% match with two gaps in the coding region of S protein between MT334549 (SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/UT-00087/2020, complete cds) and a China-Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 sample (raw data from SRR11313271), involving the loci of 22,767-22,956 within the RBD ( Figure 4D ). Distinctly, 4I.C2 identified another coding region of S protein in the MT334562 genome, which shows 100% match in the alignment to RBM ( Figure 4E ). These two genomic regions are encoding the RBD/RBM of SARS-CoV-2.\nSARS-CoV-2 initiates its infection by the recognition of human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is mediated by the S protein on the virion surface [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . The S protein is cleaved by the human protease into S1 and S2 subunits. S1 subunit contains the RBD that directly binds to ACE2 [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . The RBM is the core component of the RBD [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . RBD and RBM are critical for S protein to bind to human ACE2, in which RBM accounts for the interaction domain of S protein. We call the mismatches from the alignments for 4I.C1 as 'hidden mutations' because we cannot tell which sequence in the alignments has a mutated locus (or loci). These mutations indicate that the binding between RBM and ACE2 is dynamic. To investigate the dynamic binding between RBM and ACE2, we implemented protein structure dockings between the modeled S proteins (with and without the 'hidden mutations' in the alignments of 4I.C1) and human ACE2 protein using HDOCK [26] The threshold for the high-quality reads from BGI and Illumina platforms is 0.9 (marked by a dash line) and that for Ion-Torrent and Nanopore is 0.2 (marked by a dash line)."}, {"section_title": "Figure 2.", "text": "Local genomic similarity distribution by origin-independent analysis. Local genomic similarity mapping by the BHS values of the BLAST alignments between the raw sequencing reads from each data set and the genome sequence in the NCBI Betacoronavirus database. The virus genomes identified from the same country were categorized by the country name, as shown in rows. Results from our customized database are shown in Supplementary Figure S1 . The geographic information was derived from target data sets with the assembled genomes.\nLastly, we further identified the dynamic RBM in the SARS-CoV-2 genomes. We used BLAST to align the RBM regions of 380 genomes in our customized SARS-CoV-2 database. A longer region with 'hidden' mutations is elucidated, which we called 'canyon' (Figure 4C ). The canyon covers \u223c80% of RBM and carries hidden genomic mutations that prevent BLAST alignments. The canyon is more likely to appear in the genomes of the viruses from Spain but not the United States, which may explain why the pandemic is more severe in the United States. It may be due to the conservation of RBM in the viruses from the United States.\nThe difference between the alignments of 4I.C1 and 4I.C2 is in the alignments to the viruses from Spain ( Figure 4A ). 4I.C1 has low BHS in the alignments to Spain but 4I.C2 has high BHS, meaning that the viruses in 4I.C2 have more hits aligned to the virus genomes from Spain. The hit domains in the S protein can explain the difference ( Figure 4B , Chi-square test, \u03c7 2 = 15.3, df = 2, P = 0.0005). The hit domains for the alignments in the 4I.C1 ( Figure 4B , right panel) and the low BHS scores for 4I.C1 aligned to the viruses from Spain suggest that the dynamic of the RBM/RBD is more complex than expected. The early outbreak samples in 4I.C1 may have their unique mutations ( Figure 4D ) that prevent the BLAST alignment hits with 100% match.\nIn summary, the uneven similarity distribution among the SARS-CoV-2 viruses is related to the dynamic genomes of these viruses during the pandemic. Our analysis avoided using the assumed ancestors and hosts for SARS-CoV-2 but instead used local BLAST genomic alignments to study the genomic similarities among the SARS-CoV-2 viruses worldwide. The merit of our local genomic analysis is its elegant capability in revealing the important local genomic sequences for comparison of the SARS-CoV-2 viruses worldwide, e.g. the unstable canyon region in RBD. Distinct from the traditional mutation analyses, we are the first to identify the strong statistical association between the uneven similarity distribution and the infection incidence and mortality. The dynamic regions identified from the RBD/RBM of S protein also explain why the viruses can lead to diverse incidence and Table S2 ). mortality of illness. The current severity information of different strains is incomplete yet. If the severity information of each strain is available, additional characterization of protein coding potentials and host-virus protein interactions should be further evaluated. The dynamic genome regions in the viruses should be explored by experimental strategies in the future, which will be more promising to discover potential genomic targets for neutralizing antibodies and vaccine development."}, {"section_title": "SARS-CoV-2 raw sequencing data sets", "text": "We searched and collected raw data through the SRA (https:// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) and identified 32 RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and DNA sequencing (DNA-seq) data sets for SARS-CoV-2 (Supplementary Table S1 ).

The threshold for Q30 ratios is 0.9 for Illumina and BGI platforms and 0.2 for Ion-Torrent and Nanopore. Table S10 ).
