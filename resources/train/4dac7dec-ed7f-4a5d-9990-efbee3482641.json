It is the dominant species of commercial lumber for pulp/paper and saw timber on more than 29 million acres in the South (U.S. Forest Service 1990) . Loblolly pine is attractive to the forestry industry due to its rapid rate of growth under a wide array of soil and weather conditions. Traditionally, it has been produced in coastal plain and Piedmont regions in the southeast, but managed plantations have extended well into the Ozark highlands region of northern Arkansas, providing evidence of the trees' adaptability to a multitude of conditions. Pine is also unique among crops considered for use in sequestering carbon and producing biomass. Unlike switchgrass, forage sorghum, and black willow, which have been considered for carbon sequestration and biomass production in earlier analyses, pine has the potential to substantially improve net GHG emissions from agriculture due to its ability (i) to sequester large amounts of atmospheric carbon not only in the soil but also in timber products and (ii) to provide returns to producers from an already established timber market rather than from a newly developing biomass market (Smith 2010, Popp and . Additionally, pine branches, bark, and needles are used as mulch and as a renewable energy source.\nWe estimated costs of production and yields for loblolly pine using a pine growth model developed from the works of Pienaar, Shiver, and Harrison (1997) , Jokela (2004) , Brinker et al. (2002) , and Adegbidi et al. (2002) . We did not include spatial differences in the environmental parameters (soil depth, slope, previous crop, drainage, etc.) because those characteristics vary extensively across Arkansas. Similar to Smith (2010) , a stand density of 700 seedlings per acre at planting with 30 percent thinning in the fi fteenth year of the stand and with fertilization held constant across all counties generated a biomass yield of 8.77 tons per acre (Table 1) . This yield estimate compares to the estimate by University of Arkansas Cooperative Extension Service (UACES) (2008) on medium-to high-quality sites of fi ve to six tons per acre. Their estimate includes harvested biomass (pulp wood and saw timber) only and was predicated on conversion of agricultural land to forest. The UACES estimate did not contain our allowances for increased production in response to fertilization or for above-ground production of needles, branches, and bark.\nWe divided the pine production process into (i) establishment (chemical weed control, seeding, and fertilization), (ii) maintenance (fertilization in year 6 and year 18), (iii) thinning (year 15), and (iv) harvest (year 30). Establishment and maintenance costs are shown in Table 1 . Further details about production as they pertain to this analysis are described in Smith (2010) . Modeling pine as an alternative to traditional agricultural crops presents some complexities. Annual returns to conventional crop production need to be compared to cost and revenue streams that occur over an extended period of time. Pine takes approximately 25 to 35 years from the time of planting until harvest. Over this stand life, producers are not able to switch to other crops that at times provide better returns when relative prices favor those crops over timber. Compared to traditional crops, producers view this as an added risk to pine production that is the likely cause for pine's limited adoption as an alternative crop in Arkansas to date. To capture this risk, we added a long-term risk premium of 5.5 percent (Hardie 1984) to the discount rate used for calculating the long-term costs for equipment for all other enterprises. The risk premium reduced the present value of future revenues and costs and led to lower returns since positive cash fl ow does not occur until year 15 (thinning) and year 30 (harvest). Note that pine producers may thin stands two or three times over the stand life to enhance the quality of the wood and thereby the price generated by the stand. Because our goal a Prorated present value of total cost over stand life at a capital-recovery rate of 6 percent. Pine has an added 5.5 percent risk premium on the capitalrecovery rate given the timing of cash fl ows and the long-term investment horizon associated with pine. b Field preparation occurs in September and includes one pass with a disc to incorporate 1 ton of lime, 167 pounds of phosphate (0-45-0), and 83 pounds of potash (potassium) (0-0-60) fertilizer on hay. No fertilizers are applied on pasture during fi eld preparation. c Pre-planting weed control includes one herbicide application of one active-ingredient pound of glyphosate (Roundup \u00ae ) in March by air for hay and pasture and ten pints per acre on pine. d Planting includes one pass with a cultipacker and eight pounds of pure live seed applied using a no-till drill for accurate depth control. Hay and pasture are planted in April. Pine planting also occurs in April and involves a four-person planting crew and a planting density of 700 seedlings per acre at a cost of $0.035 per seedling. e Post-planting aerial herbicide applications to hay consist of gramoxone in the establishment year. Pasture weeds are controlled with rotary mowing and Grazon P+D. Pine herbicide applications consist of a second treatment with ten pints of glyphosate per acre. f Operating interest at an annual rate of 7.17 percent is charged on all expenses except capital recovery on owned equipment. g The other cost for pine production is an initial application of a second type of fertilizer: 109 pounds of nitrogen (46-0-0), 111 pounds of phosphate (0-45-0), and 133 pounds of potash (0-0-60). h Rotary mowing of pasture, which knocks down undesirable grass species and brush, is common in Arkansas. Two such operations are modeled. i Pasture fertilizer applications consist of 200 pounds of lime, 125 pounds of ammonium nitrate (34-0-0), 100 pounds of phosphate (0-45-0), and 75 pounds of potash (0-0-60) per acre using a spin spreader. Fertilizer is calculated to refl ect standard Cooperative Extension recommendations for lime, phosphate, and potash and suffi cient nitrogen to support one cow/calf pair on two and a half acres with additional livestock (replacement heifers and herd sires). For hay, the fertilizer program to replace nutrients is 89 pounds of phosphate (0-45-0), 133 pounds of potash (0-0-60), and 220 pounds of ammonium nitrate (34-0-0) annually beginning in year 2. For pine, there are additional applications of fertilizer when the stand reaches year 6 and year 18; the applications consist of 435 pounds of nitrogen (46-0-0), 196 pounds of phosphate (0-45-0), and 192 pounds of potash (0-0-60). j Hay is harvested using mower/conditioners, hay rakes (25 percent of acreage), large round balers (1,275 pounds of dry matter or 1,500 pounds at 15 percent moisture) with bale wraps, and automatic bale-movers for staging without tarps or storage pad preparation. For pine, we do not calculate a harvest cost since pine is presumed to be sold at the current stumpage price, and, as a result, the harvest cost is incurred by the mill or is subcontracted. The carbon footprints for the harvesting processes are held constant for all of the enterprises. We assume that harvesting and thinning consumes fuel at a rate of 12.64 gallons per acre for the feller buncher, cable skidder, and loader at a performance rate of approximately one acre per hour.\nis estimating net GHG mitigation, we modeled a single thinning. Additional thinnings would result in greater GHG emissions from fuel use for the operations."}, {"section_title": "Carbon Sequestration", "text": "Carbon is stored in the biomass of agricultural crops both above and below the ground, and the quantity stored can be estimated by converting reported yields to biomass production using a harvest index and shoot-to-root ratios (Prince et al. 2001 . A portion of the carbon that is trapped in the biomass remains sequestered in the soil. Carbon from the above-ground biomass can be sequestered in the soil through decomposition of organic matter on the surface with leaching of dissolved carbon into the soil or by incorporation of the plant matter into the soil through tillage. The below-ground biomass decomposes via microbial activity with some carbon sequestered as a function of soil texture and tillage. Clayey soils can sequester more carbon than loamy or sandy soils while tillage positively affects microbial decomposition and thereby increases GHG emissions from the soil, a negative for sequestration potential . Sequestration (S ijts ) was thus calculated by county (i), crop (j), tillage method (t), and county-specifi c soil texture (s). Pine sequestration was treated differently than traditional row crops because pine sequesters carbon not only in the soil but also in timber products. The soil sequesters pine carbon below ground via fi ne, coarse, and tap roots and above-ground debris (pine needles, branches, etc.) that comes in contact with the soil; the wood products produced from the trees provide above-ground sequestration. We did not include timber used in pulp wood, wood chips, and trash in our sequestration estimates due to the limited amount of time those products store carbon (typically less than fi ve years). We treated all wood collected during thinning as pulp wood and excluded its carbon from the model as well. Poles and lumber produced during the fi nal harvest, on the other hand, trap carbon for an extended period of time and we counted the carbon contained in those products as part of pine's carbon sequestration potential. The carbon sequestered by wood products and the soil was prorated over the 30-year stand life to obtain an annual estimate of the quantity of carbon sequestered that was then comparable to the other annual cropping enterprises."}, {"section_title": "Carbon Emissions", "text": "This analysis implemented a scan-level life cycle assessment approach that tracked GHG emissions in estimated CEs from Nalley, Popp, and Fortin (2011) for 78 of the most common production practices associated with the six largest crops in Arkansas-corn (7 practices), wheat (4 practices), cotton (31 practices), rice (8 practices), soybeans (20 practices), and sorghum (4 practices)-plus hay (1 practice), pasture (1 practice), and pine (2 practices). Our model included CE emissions from fuel, fertilizers, and chemicals used for each crop and production method. Both direct emissions (such as carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) from diesel fuel used by farm machinery) and indirect emissions from upstream manufacturing of inputs such as fertilizer and chemicals were included in the analysis. Also included were the CE emissions from nitrous oxide (N 2 O) that is generated by nitrogen-based fertilizer applications (1.27 pounds of CE per pound of nitrogen applied) and methane from rice production at 1,367 pounds of CE per acre . For the pasture enterprise, no emissions were included in the model for livestock grazing. Livestock are a signifi cant source of CE emissions as a result of methane produced from enteric fermentation and from urination and defecation. These emissions were not included in this analysis because they are a function of livestock profi tability, an aspect that was not incorporated in our state model of crop returns. Further, we excluded CE emissions that result from downstream transportation, drying, and secondary processing for all of the crops considered, including pine, as the scope of this analysis was only up to the farm gate. When possible, the emission levels in the model (E ijn ) were specifi c to the county (i), crop (j), and production method (n) where production method specifi cs were exogenous to the model and dictated by information provided by commodityspecifi c experts. Spatial variation in emissions for hay, pasture, and pine production methods could not be calculated given the lack of available data."}, {"section_title": "Arkansas Crop Model", "text": "We used the crop model for Arkansas developed by Popp, Nalley, and Vickery (2008) to track changes in net GHG emissions, sequestration, net returns (NR), and acreage in production for the fourteen crop enterprises included in the study (pine on crop land and pasture; rice; irrigated and nonirrigated cotton; irrigated corn; wheat; irrigated, nonirrigated, and double-cropped soybeans; irrigated and nonirrigated sorghum; pasture; and hay). The model assumed producer profi t maximization and tracked county yields, use of fertilizers, seed, irrigation, chemicals, herbicides, labor, and fuel across production methods and counties to provide a spatial estimate of expected crop patterns. Given the lack of available data, yields could be differentiated only by whether they were from irrigated or nonirrigated production and whether the fi elds were single-or double-cropped. We included constraints to refl ect historical values for the minimum and maximum number of acres harvested and irrigated by county and by crop. The constraints limit land-use changes to refl ect typical crop rotations, secondary processing, and other factors. Profi t maximization for the model was expressed in two components: (i) net returns from production (revenue minus production-related expenses) for each crop alternative and (ii) returns from a carbon offset market. Net production returns were defi ned as y ij = the yield in county i for crop j. The yields for the six largest crops in Arkansas were based on average yields by county for 2005 through 2009 reported by NASS (2010). Pine yield was a function of annual growth and was based on fertilizer applications, planting densities, and the timing of thinning and harvesting (Pienaar, Shiver, and Harrison 1997 , Jokela 2004 , Adegbidi et al. 2002 , Smith 2010 . Hay yields were based on information from USDA's Census of Agriculture for 1992 Agriculture for , 1997 Agriculture for , 2002 Agriculture for , and 2007 . Pasture yields were calculated to support a cow/ calf pair on 2.5 acres using yield expectations from Hunneycutt, West, and Phillips (1998) and did not vary by county. The pasture yields were used not to calculate producer production returns but to determine the carbon sequestration potential of pasture land.\nc ijn = the total specifi ed cost in county i for crop j using production method n. The production method for each crop was chosen exogenously for specifi c regions of the state from N j production technology choices that varied by crop and refl ected information available in 2007. The costs of production for the six largest crops in Arkansas were based on county-and cropspecifi c average total specifi ed costs provided by UACES (2008) . We estimated pine's cost of production using calculations from Smith (2010) that were in turn based on a review of the literature and expert opinion (see Table 1 ). The hay and pasture budgets consisted of the input costs required to establish and maintain these crops (fuel, labor, fertilizers, herbicides, and seed) as reported in Table 1 . These were generic production costs based on two cuttings for hay and standard cow/calf production methods for pasture. Again, pasture's cost of production was used only to determine CE emissions because production returns to pasture were based on cash rent.\nx ijn = acres in county i for crop j by production method n.\nReturns from the carbon offset market were defi ned as (2) Maximize NR carbon = where BCF ij = the baseline estimate of the carbon footprint in county i for all acres in that county planted to crop j and calculated by solving equation (1) acresmin i /acresmax i = county-level historical minimum and maximum number of acres harvested and in pasture. Since there was no historical record of acres converted from crops, hay, and pasture to pine, we limited the adoption of pine to 10 percent of available pasture acres and 3.3 percent of crop acres. These percentages were chosen so that pine would not encroach on the historical values for acres of pasture required for cow/calf production identifi ed in Popp, Nalley, and Vickery (2008) and as a function of the long-term investment horizon of pine production (30 years).\nirrmax j = the amount of irrigation water applied per acre in county j in the baseline model run that serves as a constraint for maximum allowable water use. This constraint is needed to limit potential policy alternatives from choosing a land-use choice that would use more water as a result of crop-specifi c irrigation needs (irr ijn ) that also vary by production method and county. Table 2 shows the crop prices (p j ) and estimated per-acre state averages of the yield (y ij ), total specifi ed expense (c ij ), emission (E ij ), sequestration (S ijts ), carbon footprint (E ij -S ijts ), and net return (nr ij ) for each crop using baseline acreage numbers for the crop calculated in equation (3). These baseline values for the state as a whole are weighted by each county's acreage and production methods (including tillage) and by soil texture. Table 1 reports similar estimates of annualized costs and returns for hay, pasture, and pine as specifi ed for the model."}, {"section_title": "Carbon Market", "text": "To model the impact of various carbon prices on land use, a necessary fi rst step was to establish the profi t-maximizing crop pattern under existing price levels. Thus, the baseline model solution represents the crop mix that maximizes the state's return under average commodity and input prices for 2005 through 2009 using 2007 production technologies that included pine as a cropping alternative. This model run also generated baseline carbon footprints that could be reported at the state (\u2211\u2211BCF ij ), county (\u2211BCF j ), and crop (\u2211BCF i ) level and even at each county's crop (BCF ij ) level with carbon footprint defi ned as quantity emitted (E ijn ) minus quantity sequestered (S ijts ). A negative carbon footprint thus represents net sequestration and a positive footprint implies that the crop or county is a net emitter of carbon.\nDeviations from the baseline as a result of modifying the price of carbon in equation (2) would thus allow us to determine whether producer incomes and crop patterns change. We modeled the carbon price at $0.10 per ton, the most prevalent 2010 trade price for carbon on the Chicago Climate Exchange, and at $5, $15, and $30 per ton as a result of policy interactions exogenous to the model. This range of carbon prices was similar to previous analyses Popp 2010, Popp et al. 2011 ) and provided estimates of carbon footprint responses to a market-based incentive.\nCarbon-offset cash fl ows for producers were thus based on deviations from the baseline. Carbon-offset revenues for producers are available if, compared to the baseline, the carbon footprint declines. The opposite is true if climate change is impacted adversely (i.e., the carbon footprint increases). For example, if producers replaced rice acres (rice, on average, emits the most carbon of the crops commonly grown) (Figure 1 ) with pine acres, they would earn carbon-offset revenue in the amount of the change in carbon footprint (1,601 pounds per year emitted by rice replaced by net sequestration of 2,802 pounds per year for pine for a carbon-offset payment for 4,403 pounds (2.2 tons) at the current carbon price). Production returns per acre would change as well since $181 per acre returned from rice production (Table 2) would be lost and would be replaced by a minimal production return from pine at $2 per acre (Table 1) . In this particular case, a producer thus would not choose to reduce rice acres in favor of pine production until the carbon price was approximately $81 per ton, at which point the loss in production return would be offset by a gain from selling 2.2 tons of carbon offset per acre. The model accounts for these substitutions for all crops in all counties and optimizes returns to crop production and carbon trading pending different carbon price levels within the resource constraints employed in the model. Note that the model predicts the change in total county acreage for each cropping enterprise and does not speak to direct substitution of specifi c crops on a particular acre. For example, even in a single county a simultaneous loss of acres devoted to cotton and gain in acres of pine does not imply that the cotton acres were shifted to pine production unless those two enterprises were the only crops affected and total harvested acres did not change. More often, several crops are affected in a particular county so analyses of crop-substitution patterns are cumbersome for the large number of counties and crops entertained in this model. Hence we report changes in crop patterns without discussing spatially different crop substitutions for each county; instead, we report returns and net GHG emission changes on a more aggregated basis by county with changes in yield, cost of production, and soil texture for each crop."}, {"section_title": "Price Response to Acreage Shifts", "text": "Commodity prices may change due to acreage shifts. However, since commodity prices are driven to a large extent by global forces, signifi cant commodity-price effects were not expected for the cropping enterprises modeled, and price responses to acreage changes were not included in the analysis. As an example, Arkansas is the largest rice producer in the United States and rice is also the most profi table and highest net emitter of GHGs of the crops in this analysis. A shift away from rice production should thus affect domestic and world prices more than acreage changes in the other crops considered. To account for this effect, we used the Arkansas Global Rice Model (Wailes and Chavez 2010) to determine the price effects of a 12.9 percent reduction in Arkansas rice acreage as a result of irrigation restrictions. Results of that analysis showed a domestic price increase of approximately 1.1 percent and a world price increase of 0.9 percent. Such large shifts in acreage were not expected in this analysis so these price effects were not analyzed."}, {"section_title": "Production vs. Carbon Market Effects on Producer Returns", "text": "Since carbon-offset revenues and production returns are determined separately as shown in equations (1) and (2), the impact of policy-induced changes in carbon prices can be tracked to offer insight into changes in production returns and carbon-market trading as a result of land-use changes. This analysis allowed us to determine how much a carbon policy might shift the source of returns to producers from production revenue to payments received from carbon trading. Also, since the analysis was performed at the county level, spatial changes in pine production could be tracked by county."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Baseline Model Results", "text": "The baseline model generated crop mixes, annual net returns, and annual carbon footprints for Arkansas crop agriculture as previously defi ned (see Table 2 ). We estimate the net state return as $574 million with a carbon footprint of 287,000 tons of carbon sequestered annually on 8.01 million acres of land harvested (Tables 3, 4 , and 5). "}, {"section_title": "Relative Per-Acre Crop Profi tability and Carbon Footprint", "text": "The estimated state carbon footprint improves as carbon-offset prices increase (Table 4) . Estimated carbon sequestration increases from 3.28 million to 3.88 million tons while emissions drop from 2.99 million to 2.95 million tons as p c increases to $30 per ton. Improvement in the state carbon footprint, then, is driven by changes in sequestration and not by emission reductions as the price of carbon increases. This result holds for all carbon-offset price levels. The change in the carbon footprint is a Total of all acres in production for the fourteen crops listed, including pine and pasture. b Pine pasture acreage enters into the production mix at a carbon offset price of $15 per ton on 385,657 acres, the adoption limit set on pasture acres. Percentage changes could not be calculated as there were no acres under the baseline scenario.\nprimarily a function of acreage being reallocated from crops that are net emitters (rice, nonirrigated cotton, and wheat) or from crops that sequester relatively small amounts (sorghum, soybeans, and pasture) to pine and corn, crops that are capable of sequestering relatively large amounts of carbon. Hence, the model accounts for countylevel changes in net GHG emissions as crop substitutions occur. However, the relative carbon footprint per acre of each crop, as shown in Figure 1 , is not the entire story. The relative profi tability of individual crops is also important. This is demonstrated by the relatively small reduction in acres of rice (Table 3) , which is the lead emitter but also the most profi table crop in the state (Table 2) . Individual crops' state average net returns per acre from production (baseline of $0.010 per ton) and carbon markets are shown in Figure 2 . These returns change with the carbon-offset price (p c ), the total number of acres of the crop grown, and differences across counties in the spatial allocation of exogenous production methods and yields. These relative changes in profi tability for individual crops drive the crop mix, the net state carbon footprint, and allocation of overall agricultural returns between crop production and carbon trading. For example, the average per-acre state return from wheat increases from $56 under the base scenario to $58 under the $30-per-ton carbon-offset price. Since the number of acres of wheat declined, the increase in return came from carbon-offset payments earned for fewer emissions (since wheat is a net emitter) and from replacing the least profi table (across the state) wheat acres with crops that generate greater relative returns. So, while wheat, as a net emitter, suffers a reduction in acreage in a carbon offset market, the per-acre return from the remaining acres of wheat increases on average. It is the relative return per acre across crops that drives acreage allocation. Figure 2 shows that pine's relative state average profi tability increases as the carbon-offset price rises, to the point where only rice, corn, and wheat are relatively more profi table. Note that Figure 2 does not hold for each individual county with differences in yields and costs of production across counties. In addition, the acreage reallocation to pine is subject to the availability of acres of crop, hay, and pasture, which is a function of the traditional crop-acreage minima and the imposed constraint on pine adoption for pasture (10 percent) and crop land (3.3 percent). Overall, increases in p c lead to decreases in acres of wheat, nonirrigated soybeans, nonirrigated cotton, sorghum, hay, pasture, and rice. By the same token, crops with greater sequestration capability (corn and pine) gain acres. Again, these changes are driven by the changes in relative profi tability of various crops discussed earlier. Pine on pasture enters the model at p c = $13.45 per ton and realizes its maximum allowable 10 percent of pasture acres at p c = $15 per ton. Allocation of pine to crop land continues to increase with each step up in p c . Compared to the baseline, pine acreage increases when the carbon offset price is as little as $0.65 per ton and does not reach the allowed maximum of 3.3 percent of crop and hay land. The increase in p c also adds an additional 10,000 harvestable acres (fallowed land brought into production as a result of increased returns to producers) to overall crop production in the state (from 8.01 million baseline acres to 8.02 million under p c = $30)."}, {"section_title": "Sources of Changes in State Profi tability", "text": "Increasing the carbon-offset payments adds a revenue source and therefore increases the state's net returns. Base net returns and percentage increases from the baseline for the three levels of p c are shown in Table 5 . These changes are from carbon-offset revenue and shifts in production returns as previously defi ned and are highlighted for the state by crop in Table 6 . For example, at p c of $15 per ton, total carbon revenue for the state is $7.84 million while overall net revenue (NR) for the state increases by only $1.45 million. Hence, production returns decline by $6.39 million. Since the shift in crops involves more long-term plantings of pine (a 30-year production horizon), this breakdown of the state's returns between the carbon market and traditional markets is offered to demonstrate the exposure of agricultural returns to fl uctuations in carbon prices. It also shows how individual crops are affected differently by carbon a Payments made to producers for lowering carbon footprint from the baseline. A negative number in the case of nonirrigated soybeans indicates a loss of net sequestration as nonirrigated soybeans are net sequesterers and decline in acres. The positive number for carbon trading for rice implies revenue for rice producers for reducing net emitting acres. The source of payments for carbon offsets is not addressed but as a result of market interactions with individuals or agencies interested in either retiring carbon offsets for the betterment of climate or purchasing the offsets for allowing emissions in sectors outside the crop agricultural model as defi ned here. b Changes in production returns are the result of acreage reallocation among crops and changes in production practices within crops. These production returns are from traditional agricultural markets for feed, food, and fi ber and are relative to the baseline. c The total change in net return is the net return predicted by the model estimations under each carbon-offset price relative to the baseline. The total net return represents the sum of carbon trading returns and changes in the production returns for each carbon-offset price. trading at the aggregate state level. While the rice sector gains from carbon payments, the payments are insuffi cient to offset the losses in production returns from rice. The same holds for nonirrigated cotton and wheat as they are also net emitting crops and lose acreage. In contrast, soybeans produced without irrigation only reduce the state's revenue. Acres of nonirrigated soybeans decline as the carbon price rises, and that loss of acres reduces both the amount of carbon sequestered (since soybeans are net sequesterers) and returns from soybean production. The same holds for sorghum, hay and pasture. Finally, pine and corn gain from both the carbon market and increased production returns. To be clear, this does not imply that individual producers of nonirrigated soybeans lose with the implementation of a carbon market. They can reallocate their land resources to pine or another more profi table crop that offers added returns through carbon-offset revenue. Figure 3 shows spatial pine acreage allocation by county for the four carbon-offset prices. Pine acres under the base price are predominately in the northwestern and southern portions of the state, a fi nding that is consistent with existing lumber mill locations. As the carbon price increases to $15 per ton, the number of acres devoted to pine increases in the northwest part of the state (replacing pasture). At a carbon-offset price of $30 per ton, the relative profi tability of pine increases such that it makes signifi cant in-roads into the delta counties, where row crops are traditional."}, {"section_title": "Spatial Changes in Pine Acres", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "This study examined the implications of adding pine to a traditional crop model as a designated carbon sequestering crop in Arkansas and increasing $30.00 per Ton the price of carbon offsets. Our model increased the price of carbon offsets from a baseline level ($0.10 per ton) to $5, $15, and $30 per ton of carbon to determine the effects of higher carbon prices on the state's carbon footprint, acreage reallocations, and changes in the source of returns to agricultural crop production activities. The analysis shows that increasing the price of carbon leads to improvements in the state's carbon footprint and net return. Acreage is reallocated among crops based on their relative profi tability; crops with relatively small returns (primarily pasture, nonirrigated soybeans, and sorghum) are replaced by crops that provide greater returns (pine and corn). This relative profi tability is affected by the carbon-offset price. However, the allocation and profi tabiity of crops with high production returns (rice) change only slightly; carbon prices have to be quite high before payments from the carbon market for reducing acres can offset losses in production returns. Finally, as the carbon price increases, producer returns from a carbon market take on a larger role than changes in returns from production and land use choices. While the extent of the effect of carbon payments on overall profi tability varies across crops and crop production methods, increases in the carbon price have an overall positive effect. Especially in the case of pine, the added returns from a higher carbon price result in greater reliance on the carbon market as a primary source of producer income. Further research is needed to determine how such acreage shifts would affect secondary processing industries and net GHG emissions. For example, would lumber mills locate in crop-producing regions?"}]
