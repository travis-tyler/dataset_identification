[{"section_title": "RESEARCH PROBLEM", "text": "The structure of computational spatial analysis has mostly built on data lattices inherited from cartography, where visualization of information takes priority over analysis. In these framings, spatial relationships cannot easily be encoded into traditional data lattices. This hinders spatial analysis that emphasizes how interactions among spatial entities reflect mutual inter-relationships at a very basic level. With this limitation, landscape compositions and configurations can be appreciated further if a topologically and temporally enabled data structure is available. The aim of this research is to develop a data structure and its associated analytical methods to assess the connections and interactions of landscape elements through time and space. This additional layer of information will help us understand the dynamics of processes happening within and between components of landscapes."}, {"section_title": "OUTLINE OF OBJECTIVES", "text": "This research has the following objectives: 1) Establishing a topologically enabled data structure using graph theory. The aim for this portion of research is to develop a \"piggy-back\" topological data structure which can be produced from existing vector and raster dataset, thus maximize the compatibility of the methods developed in this research. 2) Examine landscape patterns and their dynamics in the form of subgraphs from the data structure. The graph data structure will be interrogated using methods ranging from pair-wise change monitoring (Graph Edit Distance) to more complicated subgraph structure monitoring (cliques, communities). The associated extraction methods have to be adapted from currently available mathematical graph tools. 3) Evaluate the prominence of subgraph patterns on the landscape and explain them in the context of geography and landscape ecology. Extraction of subgraphs and numerical assessment of patterns on their own might not be sufficient in explaining patterns on the landscape. Here domain expert knowledge will be utilized to link up concepts from geography and landscape ecology with that of our empirical results."}, {"section_title": "STATE OF THE ART", "text": "Despite the popularity and variety of spatial statistics, its ability to appraise landscape connectivity theories through spatial patterns has been limited. Instead they are viewed and used as means to an end. Typical spatial pattern analysis has been concerned primarily with statistical distribution of individual types of entities. In such operations, the mechanism for describing relationships between types of entities relies on comparison of clusters or accumulative statistics. Patterns discovered using these procedures provide significant insight into the composition of the landscape, but far less about its configuration. Processes that cause interactions and changes between entities are not deciphered. As such, extraction of \"patterns\" in this way remains relatively superficial as description of distributions takes priority over the possibility of identifying relational processes. Thus accumulative statistics may not be the most suitable framework for realizing the conceptual idea of a connected landscape. The concept of connected landscape comes from landscape ecology. The term Landscape Ecology was coined by Troll (1939) in an effort to frame enquiry into interactions among elements and associated processes that explain ecological patterns in landscapes. At the early stages of its inception, analyses were restricted to thought experiments on conceptual models and small scale case studies due to difficulties in the acquisition and processing of data. With advances in computing power, renewed interest has been evident, increasingly targeting the implementation of concepts in a systematic manner. The realization of concepts are restricted by the availability of tools. Current GIS and remote sensing represent landscape with two main types of data structures: a field view in raster data, and a feature view in vector data. Both structures developed when static visualization of spatial information took priority. Although spatial relationships in forms of proximity and topology are embedded in these structures, this information is often not utilized. More process-oriented approaches necessitate the inclusion of spatial relationships to operate effectively (Takeyama and Couclelis, 1997). Despite limited attention in the earlier years of GIS, graph theory has shown promising results for representing structural properties of landscapes, landscape connectivity and ecological fluxes Gaucherel et al., (2012) used graph theory to represent interacting patchy landscapes. Thibaud et al., (2013) encoded time into spatial graphs to monitor the structural movements of marine sand dunes. Pascual-Hortel et al., (2006, p1-2) noted that \"graph structures have been shown to be a powerful and effective way of both representing the landscape pattern and performing complex analysis regarding landscape connectivity\", demonstrating the viability of landscape graphs as a data structure for more substantive analysis. Similarly, Kupfer (2012) noted that landscape graphs can bridge the gap between structure and function, while also acknowledging that calculation and interpretation of results may be challenging."}, {"section_title": "METHODOLOGY", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Spatial Temporal Relational Graph", "text": "We proposed to use graph theory as a basis to construct our topologically and temporally enabled data structure. The data structure is called Spatial Temporal Relational Graph (STRG). The basic structure of STRG is built upon nodes and edges, identical to that of mathematical graphs. The nodes in STRG represent centroids of patches in a landscape and edges represent the neighbourhood relationships between them. Each of the nodes represent a spatial entity which occupy physical space in the real world, therefore they are also encoded with geographical location in the form of Euclidean coordinates. Auxiliary geometric information which might assist in analysis such as patch size, area occupied and other intrinsic properties of the patch are also encoded. The temporal domain is implemented as a stack of graphs representing snapshots of times. Finally the dynamics of nodes are tracked through time using object tracking methods. This graph based data structure encapsulates spatial, temporal and relational properties in an abstract representation of the landscape. Spatial and temporal resolution is entirely dependent upon the context of study and the availability of datasets. A study on landcover change in remote regions might require lower spatial and temporal resolution given the limited amount of change, whereas urban morphology monitoring requires high resolution data for both spatial and temporal domains due to the compactness of urban structures, and their rapid rate of change. An advantage of this structure is that spatial entities are linked spatially and temporally, without any loss of information. It is also possible to attach a variety of attributes to the nodes and edges in a graph as needed to further characterise the landscape. The graph form allows us to apply graph analysis methods to interrogate landscape relationships without much difficulty."}, {"section_title": "Graph Edit Distance", "text": "One of the most elementary form of landscape analysis which can be performed in STRG is change detection by Graph Edit Distance (GED). The principle mechanism of GED is to monitor changes on the landscape by documenting additions and removals of nodes and edges from one snapshot to the other. Given two distinct graphs G 1 and G 2 (Figure 8), the cost of the editing operation d (G 1 ,G 2 ) to convert G 1 into G 2 is defined by: An example is shown in Figure 2. In this operation the changes included the removal of node v D , edge v B v D , and the addition of If the cost of each edit operation is equal to 1, then the total edit distance d(G1, G2) is 4. GED serves as the most basic analysis of graphbased landscapes. After this, extraction of subgraphs in the form of cliques, communities and equivalences will be initiated."}, {"section_title": "Landscape Cliques", "text": "The term clique as used in graph theory was coined by Luce and Perry (1949). Similar to its usage in the social context, cliques of graphs define tightly connected set of nodes. A clique from an undirected graph G = (V, E) is a subgraph of G with vertex set C \u2208 V, in which every pair of nodes in C is connected to every other by an edge (see Figure 3). In other words, a clique is a complete subgraph of a graph. Landscape ecology discusses the formation of landscape components from agglomeration of smaller landscape elements (Wiens, 2002). Cliques can be seen as landscape components, where tightly arranged landscape elements are relationally interdependent on each other. The existence of a clique demonstrates that certain compatibility characteristics exist between landscape elements, while its persistence through time suggests the importance of juxtaposition between those landscape elements in supporting their resilience. Therefore identifying types of cliques in a landscape graph and monitoring their persistence through time may yield fruitful insights on landscape structure."}, {"section_title": "DATA", "text": "In this phase of research, we use two classified temporal land-cover datasets from Great Bay, New Hampshire were used for demonstration purposes. Pre-classified images were acquired from the Coastal Change Analysis Program. The NOAA C-CAP project used Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery for land-cover classification at the full 30m pixel resolution. Our analysis is based on the patchy landscape mosaics built from these classes. The time span for the Great Bay data set is 7 years (1986 to 1993). For the purpose of clarity, the demonstration area is restricted to a 5 x 5 km region extracted from the imagery (Figure 4). In the final part of the research, time series sets of Landsat images will be acquired, classified and be implemented in STRG. "}, {"section_title": "EXPECTED OUTCOME", "text": "Currently GED had yielded us with satisfactory results regarding the changing spatial relationships between compatible/incompatible land types in our study area. Partially proving that the configuration of landscape elements is not a random act of placement, but is driven by compatibility and processes between different landscape elements. To further our understanding on configurations of landscape elements, we are exploring the existence and meaning of subgraphs in the form of landscape cliques. The existence of assemblages such as cliques is strong indications that complex landscape configurations can also be formed. It is expected this kind of topological subgraph extraction will provide even better evidence on the existence of landscape patterns. The result from subgraph analysis will be used to empirically support the concept of connected landscapes. In total, four published research papers are expected at the end of this study. The first paper focuses on construction of STRG, the second paper focuses on extraction of subgraphs from STRG, the third focuses on analytical methods of subgraph patterns, and finally the fourth paper is a case study paper combining the effort of STRG with that of traditional spatial statistics."}, {"section_title": "STAGE OF RESEARCH", "text": "From our current results, we are confident that a framework based on STRG can provide a sound foundation for empirically supporting concepts from landscape connectivity and interacting landscape elements. As mentioned, the entire research is comprised of four components, which translates to four research papers. The STRG as a data structure is fully developed and the International Journal of GIS has accepted a paper regarding this aspect. The usage of GED as a form of relational change detection has also been fully documented and ready to be submitted. At the moment we are exploring how subgraphs can be extracted from the data structure, and also their semantic meanings after they are extracted. At the same time, we are consulting with domain experts (landscape ecologists) regarding possible meanings with the extracted subgraphs. The remainder of the research including writing up of papers is expected to take one year."}]
