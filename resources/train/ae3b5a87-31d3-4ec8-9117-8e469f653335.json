[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) could be described into following four stages: healthy control (HC), early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI), late MCI (LMCI) and AD dementia. The discriminations between different stages of AD are considerably important issues for future pre-dementia treatment. However, it is still challenging to identify LMCI from EMCI because of the subtle changes in imaging which are not noticeable. In addition, there were relatively few studies to make inferences about the brain dynamic changes in the cognitive progression from EMCI to LMCI to AD.

The findings of this study provide considerable insight into the neurophysiological mechanisms in AD development."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neuro-cognitive disorder of the human brain (Keren-Shaul et al., 2017; Kodis et al., 2018) , which is characterized by the progressive loss of cognition and memory in elderly adults (Roy et al., 2016) . Along with the aging of global population, the number of individuals suffering from AD will increase (Novak et al., 2017) . It is predicted that there will be more than 100 million elderly people worldwide affected by AD by 2050 (Cortes-Canteli et al., 2015; Branca and Oddo, 2017) . Therefore, the identification of AD and particularly its transitional phase, namely mild cognitive impairment (MCI), have received increasingly growing attentions in recent years (Cui et al., 2018) . The individuals diagnosed with MCI could be further subdivided into the early MCI (EMCI) and late MCI (LMCI) (Lee et al., 2017) and the distinguishing criterions for EMCI and LMCI have been previously depicted in Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort (Nuttall et al., 2016) . At present, there is still no therapy to prevent or reverse the AD pathological process (Forster et al., 2017) . It is hence important to develop a new approach that could identify different stages of AD to enhance the understanding of AD pathophysiological progression, which is helpful to the preclinical AD studies.\nA great deal of neuroimaging techniques could be utilized to image human brain function and structure, e.g., diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), electroencephalogram (EEG), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and so on (Busato et al., 2016; Thanh Vu et al., 2017) . Due to the advantages of high temporal and spatial resolutions, fMRI especially resting-state fMRI have gained increasingly growing popularities in the investigation of the whole-brain neural connectivity recently (Goense et al., 2016) . As an advanced brain imaging technology, resting-state fMRI has shown a great potential in providing comprehensive information to achieve a high level of identification of the neurological diseases (Phillips, 2012; Rosa et al., 2015) . Accordingly, the application of non-invasive resting-state fMRI is highly advantageous to unfold the complexity of brain connectivity network and examine the brain dynamic changes from EMCI to LMCI to AD.\nMachine learning (ML) technologies were extensively used in automatic pattern recognition based on imaging data (dos Santos Siqueira et al., 2014; Moradi et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2018; Zeng et al., 2018) . In existing literature, there has been a widespread interest to utilize ML methods to classify different stages of AD. Nozadi et al. (2018) employed a random forest (RF) algorithm based on the whole-brain approach to achieve the accuracies of 72.5 and 81.7% for 164 EMCI versus 189 LMCI and 189 LMCI versus 99 AD respectively. Goryawala et al. (2015) reported the accuracies of 73.6 and 90.1% for 114 EMCI versus 91 LMCI and 91 LMCI versus 55 AD using the linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Jie et al. (2018) utilized the multi-kernel SVM and displayed a high accuracy of 78.8% classifying 56 EMCI from 43 LMCI. It is noteworthy that the discrimination between EMCI and LMCI is more challenging in comparison to LMCI and AD.\nIn order to improve the classification performances especially of EMCI and LMCI, and enhance the understanding of neuropathology in the AD progression, a new method of evolutionary weighted random SVM cluster (EWRSVMC) was presented in this paper to diagnose different stages of AD. The EWRSVMC combined multiple weighted SVM classifiers to make the final decision, which was believed to be considerably stable and robust compared to other individual classifiers such as artificial neural network and decision tree. In addition, the EWRSVMC employed a method of evolution to guide feature selection to explore the optimal feature set for better classification performance. We performed the experiment 1 for EMCI/LMCI classification and the experiment 2 for LMCI/AD classification, yielding high accuracies of 90 and 88.89% respectively using this new framework. Furthermore, the disease-related brain regions were ranked according to the corresponding optimal features' frequencies and the top-ranked brain regions could be found out. On the one hand, several high-frequency brain regions [e.g., superior temporal gyrus (STG.R), insula (INS.L) and middle temporal gyrus (MTG.L)] are presented in the two groups of experiments at the same time, which suggested that these brain regions play crucial roles in the progression of AD. On the other hand, some brain areas displayed high frequencies only in one group of experiment [e.g., superior frontal gyrus (SFGmed.L) and olfactory cortex (OLF.R) in the experiment 1, and parahippocampal gyrus (PHG.L) and posterior cingulate gyrus (PCG.L) in the experiment 2], which facilitated to understand differences in disease progression. These findings are in agreement with the claims of the previous studies on AD (Douaud et al., 2013; Xiang et al., 2013; Zhu et al., 2014) and provide a novel perspective to AD progression's neurophysiological mechanisms."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects", "text": "The neuroimaging data we utilized in this study came from the ADNI cohort 1 (Morris et al., 2014) . We collected the restingstate fMRI data of 105 participants, which contained 42 EMCI patients (18 male, average age 72.34 years), 38 LMCI patients (23 male, average age 72.99 years) and 25 AD subjects (12 male, average age 74.59 years). Every participant had clinical dementia rating (CDR) scores and mini-mental state examination (MMSE) scores to ensure that the data was homologous. Chi-squared test was utilized for gender comparisons and two-sample t-test was utilized for age, MMSE and CDR comparisons. The detailed demographic information for the patient cohorts was listed in Table 1 .\nAll participants were asked to lie still in a Siemens TRIO 3 Tesla machine using the same scanning parameters as follows: 64 \u00d7 64 acquisition matrix; flip angle = 80 \u2022 ; echo time (TE) / repetition time (TR) =30/3000 ms; pixel spacing Y/pixel spacing X = 3.3/3.3mm; 140 image volumes; 48 axial slices; 3.313 mm slice thickness with no gap.

In this paper, we employ a popular automated anatomical labeling template (Rolls et al., 2015) to divide the cerebrum into 90 brain areas (45 for left and right hemisphere respectively). A representative resting-state fMRI signal for each brain region is generated by averaging the time series of voxels within each of 90 brain regions. The Pearson correlation coefficient between the representative signals of each pair of the brain regions is computed and treated as a proxy of functional connectivity (FC) (Noble et al., 2017) . As a result, a total of 4005 (80 \u00d7 90/2) FCs are obtained for each subject and served as predictor features for the proposed EWRSVMC algorithm, which is considered to be a promising approach.\nThe Evolutionary Weighted Random SVM Cluster"}, {"section_title": "EWRSVMC Design", "text": "Machine learning techniques are widely used for pattern recognition , among which the SVM model has received increasing popularities in the analysis of neurological disease based on the high-dimensional imaging data recently. Nevertheless, utilizing the single SVM classifier is too challenging to achieve excellent diagnostic performance due to the noise of brain imaging data. Bi et al. (2018) put forward a random SVM cluster (RSVMC) in which multiple SVM classifiers are combined for a final decision-making, which outperforms an individual SVM classifier. But, it could not be ignored that the diagnostic power of each individual classifier in the ensemble classifier may be greatly differential from others. The previous method of RSVMC ignores the fact that the individual SVM classifier with relatively high training error is likely to perform wrong voting on the new samples, which is likely to degrade the discriminative ability. Accordingly, there still remains room for the improvement with respect to the RSVMC method. This paper presents a novel algorithm of EWRSVMC with two successive steps, i.e., the construction and evolution of weighted ensemble of SVMs respectively. First, in order to reduce the influence of the weak classifiers on the voting, the classification accuracy of each SVM classifier is calculated using the validation set, which is regarded as a proxy of weight of every SVM classifier. The output of EWRSVMC is a weighted average of the outputs of multiple SVMs, which could further reduce classification error rate. Second, in order to select out the most discriminative features from a large-scale feature vector, the method of evolution is introduced to dynamically eliminate the redundant features for further improving final classification performance. The idea of our proposed architecture is showed in Figure 1 , where each row and column corresponds to a subject and feature respectively in the left data matrixes.\nWe suppose X = {x 1 , ...x k , ...x n } \u2208 R N \u00d7 d as the connectivity features vectors where N and d are the numbers of all subjects and features. y i \u2208 {+1, \u22121} is the response class label representing two different states (e.g., EMCL or LMCI). The construction of the weighted random SVM cluster is performed using the following steps:\n(1) Step1: The available dataset X is divided into two data subset, i.e., a \"training and validation\" set and a test set respectively. (2) Step2: Then, the training subset and feature subset are respectively obtained by randomly selecting partial samples from above \"training and validation\" set and partial features from total features to build an individual SVM model. (3) Step3: The remaining validation subset is utilized for the estimation of diagnostic accuracy W l of l-th SVM, which is considered as a proxy of weight of the SVM.\nwhere T correct l denotes the number of validation samples correctly classified by l-th SVM classifier, T L represents the number of validation samples. (4) Step4: The step 2 to step 4 are repeated for n times to build a weighted ensemble of n SVM classifiers.\nFollowing the above steps, a weighted ensemble of multiple SVM classifiers could be constructed and then an approach of evolution is applied to the ensemble classifier to guide feature selection. Specifically, the SVM classifiers whose classification accuracies are lower than 0.5 are first picked out from the weighted random SVM cluster and considered as weak classifiers. Similarly, the remaining SVM classifiers are regarded as strong classifiers due to the good performance. Then the features selected by these weak classifiers are found out and the weights corresponding to the common features are accumulated. The total weight of each feature in weak classifiers is denoted asTw j :\nwhere p is the number of weak classifiers; w l,j represents the weight of the j-th feature corresponding to l-th weak classifier. Next, we remove the features whose total weight Tw j exceeds a certain threshold q, because these features play crucial roles in the weak classifiers and are likely to make few contributions to the excellent performance of the overall system. As a result, we obtain the remaining features with lower total weights in the weak classifiers and all the features determined by the strong classifiers as an evolutionary feature set, leading to the reduced dimensionality of total feature space. Finally, the aboveobtained evolutionary feature set is employed to rebuild a weighted random SVM cluster for the further reduction of feature dimensionality. This procedure is repeated iteratively until it reaches the times of evolutions we set. The optimal EWRSVMC with the highest accuracy during the evolution process could be found out and the features determined by this optimal EWRSVMC are considered as the optimal feature set. The feature selection procedure of the EWRSVMC is exhibited in Figure 2 ."}, {"section_title": "The Evaluation of the EWRSVMC", "text": "The EWRSVMC perform a weighted average of the outputs of multiple SVM classifiers, which could predict the class label of each new testing sample. To be specific, a new sample is firstly input into a EWRSVMC system and each individual SVM classifier performs a weighted vote in accordance with its accuracy dealing with the validation samples. Then the weighted voting values belonging to the same predicted label are added up. Lastly, the label having the highest voting value represents new sample's final predicted label.\nIn this paper, we employ the three metrics, i.e., accuracy, sensitivity and specificity to estimate our proposed EWRSVMC's final performances. The diagnostic accuracy A c stands for a fraction of correctly identified samples (Schr\u00f6der et al., 2015) :\nwhere TP, FP, FN, and TN respectively represents the number of true positives, false positives, false negatives and true negatives. Sensitivity (S n ) stands for a proportion of actual positive samples which are correctly identified (Mondal and Pai, 2014) : \nSpecificity (S p ) stands for a proportion of actual negative samples which are correctly identified (Kumar and Helenprabha, 2017) :\nThe Application of the EWRSVMC\nIn the current study, we conducted multiple binary classifications, including EMCI vs. LMCI and LMCI vs. AD to confirm the performance of our proposed EWRSVMC using 4005 FCs as the raw features. In addition to optimizing the classification accuracy as with most existing studies, we also paid great attentions to exploring and analyzing the alterations of the brain in patients with different cognitive stages of AD. Accordingly, another subprocedure for the exploration of the disease-related brain regions using the optimal features set was carried out. First, we detected the brain regions which are relevant to the optimal features in the EWRSVMC with the highest classification accuracy. Then, disease-related brain regions were sorted in a descending mode, which is consistent with their occurrence frequencies. The higher the frequencies are, the greater the abnormal degrees of the brain regions are."}, {"section_title": "Experiment Design", "text": "In this paper, we conducted the experiment 1 for EMCI vs. LMCI classification and the experiment 2 for LMCI vs. AD classification. Each group of experiment could be mainly divided into four parts:\n(1) Division of data sets. A 3:1 ratio is set to divide entire resting-state data set into the \"training and validation\" set for training the EWRSVMC and the test set for examining the generalization ability of the overall system. Furthermore, a 2:1 ratio is set to subdivide the \"training and validation\" set into the training set for training the SVM classifier and the validation set for obtaining the weight corresponding to the SVM classifier.\n(2) Building an ERWSVMC. Firstly, we randomly select \u221a 4005 \u2248 62 features from all 4005 features based on the training set to build a radial basis function (RBF) kernel SVM classifier. The kernel bandwidth \u03c3 and penalty parameter C for each SVM model are primarily set as 3 and Inf respectively. The number of initial base classifiers is set to 500 to get the weighted ensemble of SVMs. Then, we make the ensemble classifier evolves for 50 times. In each evolution, we find out the features selected by the weak classifiers and remove the features whose total weight Tw j exceeding the certain threshold q = 7. As a result, the EWRSVMCs with different evolution times are obtained.\n(3) Finding out the optimal subset of features. We compute the diagnostic accuracies of the EWRSVMCs with different evolution times. The features selected by the optimal EWRSVMC having the lowest diagnostic error rate form the optimal features subset.\n(4) Exploring the abnormal brain regions.

Meanwhile, a sensitivity of 90.9% and a specificity of 88.89% were achieved based on the optimal feature set. The experiment results showed that the novel framework could significantly enhance diagnostic performance for EMCI/LMCI classification in compared with some other existing algorithms.\nFeature selection was a crucial stage in our EWRSVMC algorithm classifying LMCI from EMCI and the process was shown in Figure 4 . On the one hand, the number of removed features increased rapidly and exceeded 100 after two evolutions. Then it became gradually stable and fluctuated around 120. On the other hand, the number of remained features showed a trend of linear decline. There were 248 features left after completing the 32nd evolution, which constituted the optimal feature set and were utilized for subsequent study on the exploration of disease-related brain regions.\nBy counting the high-frequency FCs, we could detect the most discriminative brain regions which were ranked in the Table 2 .

Resting-state fMRI is an effective tool for exploring the dynamical changes in human brain because of the high temporal and spatial resolutions (Lee M.H. et al., 2016) . In addition, to the best of our knowledge, no investigation is available about the EWRSVMC in AD studies using brain imaging data. The EWRSVMC is able to efficiently perform EMCI/LMCI and LMCI/AD classifications with the high accuracies of 90 and 88.89%, sensitivities of 90.9 and 85.71%, specificities of 88.89 and 90.9% respectively. The results of two groups of experiments demonstrate the availability of novel EWRSVMC algorithm for early detection of AD and the potential of resting-state fMRI for identification of the transition from EMCI to LMCI to AD. The ML techniques have received increasingly growing attentions recently in imaging data (Zeng et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2017) , and have been shown to be a reliable method to diagnose different cognitive stages of AD using neuroimaging data. Jiang et al. (2014) achieved a high accuracy around 80% for 56 EMCI versus 44 LMCI combining a sparse learning with the SVM classifier. Prasad et al. (2015) reported the accuracy of 63.4% for 74 EMCI vs. 38 LMCI using the SVM classifier with the feature set of the fiber network measures (FIN) and the flow network measures (FLN). Mahjoub et al. (2018) combined the proposed deep similarity network architectures with the single SVM classifier utilizing the cross-validation method to classify 41 AD from 36 LMCI with a classification accuracy peaking at 77.92%.\nThe majority of ML methods had the slightly lower classification performances especially classifying EMCI from LMCI because of image noise and small-sample size of data. In addition, a great deal of studies have paid more attention to the classification but rarely explored disease-related brain regions underlying the AD evolution. To address these issues, a new framework of EWRSVMC using the FCs as the raw features was presented in this paper. The output of EWRSVMC is a weighted average of the outputs of SVMs, which could further reduce classification error rate compared to some previous methodologies. Additionally, Due to the high dimensionality of feature space, the complexity of the algorithm is likely to be increased and the performance of model estimation is degraded. Accordingly, a method of evolution is employed to dynamically eliminate the redundant features and the features in the optimal EWRSVMC are regarded as the optimal features. Moreover, disease-related brain regions could be found out by identifying these features with high discriminative ability, which provides new insights in the pathology of AD.\nThe issue of overfitting is a major concern in the training process of our EWRSMC algorithm and more details about it are discussed here. In order to building an individual SVM classifier in EWRSVMC, the training set was randomly chosen out from the all experimental dataset and 62 FCs was randomly chosen out from total 4005 FCs as input features. Because of the randomness of samples and features, each SVM base classifier is greatly different from others, which could reduce the effects of overfitting. Furthermore, the EWRSVMC shows a good classification performance in the test set, suggesting a low risk of overfitting phenomenon.\nIn our proposed EWRSVMC, two hyperparameters, namely the penalty parameter C and the kernel bandwidth \u03c3, need to be determined. Initially, we set parameter C and \u03c3 to Inf and 3 to train the individual RBF-SVM classifier. For comparison, we tested different values for C and \u03c3 and found no considerable changes in terms of the classification performances of the EWRSVMC, suggesting that the proposed EWRSVMC is considerably robust and universal."}, {"section_title": "Analysis of Higher-Frequency Brain Regions", "text": "In this part, we mainly discussed about four abnormal brain regions, i.e., temporal lobe, insula, superior frontal gyrus, and parahippocampal gyrus respectively."}, {"section_title": "The Temporal Lobe", "text": "Some subregions of the temporal lobe had relatively greater frequencies in both EMCI/LMCI and LMCI/AD classifications, indicating that the temporal lobe is likely to play a crucial role in AD progression.
