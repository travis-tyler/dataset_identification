Conversion rates to AD were analysed (mean follow-up time 21.5\u00b19.1 months) with regard to coexisting depressive symptoms and brain amyloid load. Results A\u03b2+ depressed subjects showed large clusters with a higher amyloid load in the frontotemporal and insular cortices (p<0.001) with coincident hypermetabolism (p<0.001) in the frontal cortices than nondepressed subjects. Faster progression to AD was observed in subjects with depressive symptoms (p<0.005) and in A\u03b2+ subjects (p<0.001). Coincident depressive symptoms additionally shortened the conversion time in all A\u03b2+ subjects (p<0.005) and to a greater extent in those with a high amyloid load (p<0.001). Conclusion Our results clearly indicate that A\u03b2+ MCI subjects with depressive symptoms have an elevated amyloid load together with relative hypermetabolism of connected brain areas compared with cognitively matched nondepressed individuals. MCI subjects with high amyloid load and coexistent depressive symptoms are at high risk of faster conversion to AD.\nMethods"}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is imposing an onerous burden on health-care systems in societies with ageing populations [1] . Neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques together comprise the hallmark neuropathology of AD [2] . Elevated brain amyloid burden is clearly associated with cognitive decline in the healthy elderly [3] and in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) [4] . Recent studies have shown that late-life depression is associated with MCI [5] and with AD [6] . A higher relative risk of conversion from cognitively normal to MCI and to a lesser degree from MCI to AD [7] has been demonstrated in subsyndromally depressed elderly patients (rated by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire, NPI-Q). However, the literature remains inconclusive as to whether late-life depression is a risk factor for emergence of AD, or whether late-life depression, as an early symptom of AD, is implicated in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's type dementia. Previous investigations regarding the link between depression and brain amyloidosis have mainly focused on subjects who had previously had depressive episodes [8] [9] [10] , and have mostly found elevated \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) levels. Despite these roughly consistent amyloid PET findings, there is less concordance among [ 18 F]FDG PET studies in depressed subjects, which have shown regions of hypermetabolism [11] [12] [13] or hypometabolism [14] [15] [16] [17] .\nGiven this background, we aimed in the present study to investigate brain amyloidosis in conjunction with studies of brain glucose metabolism in the presence or absence of depressive symptoms (defined by NPI-Q) in a large cohort of MCI subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We also investigated the impact of depressive symptoms at baseline on the progression of dementia from clinical follow-up data."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative", "text": "The data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the ADNI database (adni.loni.usc.edu).

The primary goal of ADNI is to identify the optimal combinations of serial MRI, PET and other biological markers, in conjunction with clinical and neuropsychological assessments to predict and measure the progression of MCI and early AD. The objective is to determine sensitive and specific markers of very early AD progression that will aid researchers and clinicians in developing new treatments and monitoring their effectiveness, while lessening the expense and duration of clinical trials.\nThe Principal Investigator of this initiative is Michael W.

In addition, we provide the first longitudinal evaluation of progression to dementia in subsyndromal but depressed subjects using amyloid PET as an integral biomarker. Our results clearly indicate that A\u03b2+ MCI subjects with depressive symptoms suffer from elevated amyloid load compared with nondepressed individuals, with adjustment for various factors influencing cognition. The pronounced frontotemporal amyloid deposition in these patients occurred in association with relative hypermetabolism of connected brain areas on FDG PET. This finding may be related to active inflammation, or represent a form of metabolic compensation in MCI subjects. Subjects with elevated amyloid load and coexisting depressive symptoms were at high risk of faster progression to AD. [24] . The link between depression and dementia in A\u03b2+ subjects therefore might be related to the region-specific deposition of amyloid, when mood-related neurocircuits happen to be particularly affected by amyloid pathology. Our findings are in line with previously reported associations of region-specific lateral and medial temporal amyloid/ neurofibrillary tangle deposition with depression and anxiety in MCI subjects shown by [ 18 F]FDDNP PET [25] . Previous [ 11 C]PiB PET findings in a small group of patients have also provided evidence that amyloid load is elevated in late-life depressed MCI subjects [8] . CSF levels of A\u03b242 are concordantly reduced in MCI subjects suffering from late-life depression and are correlated with cognitive status [26] . Postmortem analyses have indicated a pronounced deposition of amyloid plaques and tangles in the hippocampus in the brain of AD patients with a history of major depression, while subjects with concurrent depressive symptoms at diagnosis of AD exhibit even higher levels of neuropathological change [27, 28] . The elevated frontotemporal levels of amyloid in depressed subjects found in this study are in line with these earlier histological findings. Another study revealed that AD pathology is prominent in the majority of patients with dementia and coexistent depression [29] . This is also in line with our data showing a higher proportion of A\u03b2+ subjects among MCI subjects with depression (61 %) than among MCI subjects without depression (53 %).\nThe question still remains as to whether late-life depression constitutes part of the dementia prodrome and/or represents an individual risk factor for AD. From our data we can conclude that depressive symptoms in A\u03b2+ MCI subjects were clearly associated with higher frontotemporal amyloid levels. Recently published results of the prospective Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) study indicate notably slow increases in brain amyloidosis with age, with an estimated 12 years from absence to [30] . Therefore, we can speculate that late-onset depression triggered by significant amyloid deposition may be part of the dementia prodrome, presenting as much as two decades before manifestation of AD. Indeed, Wu et al. found that patients with life-time occurrence of major depression showed increased [ 18 F]AV45 uptake (and elevation in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score) compared with depression-free MCI subjects [10] in similar brain regions as in the present investigation. However, a previous [ 11 C]PiB study of similar design did not support this association [9] . This may reflect the fact that in the latter study the cognitively normal subjects were significantly younger (mean age 61 years) with onset of Fig. 3 Kaplan-Meier analyses of time to progression to dementia. Conversion to AD at a consecutive ADNI follow-up visit was used as the specific endpoint. Progression-free survival in a depressed versus nondepressed subjects, b A\u03b2+ versus A\u03b2\u2212 subjects, c depressed versus nondepressed A\u03b2+ subjects, and d depressed versus nondepressed subjects with a high amyloid load (SUVR CBL >1.7) . **p<0.005, ***p < 0.001 (log rank test) depression six or more years previously and with complete remission from depression at the time of PET scanning. Overall, findings are consistent with a model in which present depressive episodes in older subjects could constitute a prodrome and risk factor for AD development.\nAnalysis of our longitudinal follow-up data showed that subsyndromally depressed MCI subjects (mean age 72.1 years) with a high amyloid load had a high risk of rapid conversion to AD. Recent findings in the AIBL population indicate that cognitively intact subjects with abnormal amyloid burden assessed by [ 11 C]PiB PET show a greater decline in episodic and verbal memory at 3 years especially those with comorbid anxiety [31] . Hence, mood-related neuropsychiatric symptoms are associated with more aggressive AD pathology in A\u03b2+ subjects. Although the pathophysiological mechanism underlying this association cannot be resolved by this or other studies, present data confirm a link among rapid cognitive decline, amyloid burden and depressive symptoms, which may have important implications for new treatment targets [32] ."}, {"section_title": "Amyloid-negative subjects", "text": "Following the conjecture of higher amyloid deposition in subsyndromally depressed subjects, one might expect that amyloidosis in A\u03b2\u2212 MCI subjects with depressive symptoms would all have amyloid levels close to the range or threshold for subjects with A\u03b2+ status. Surprisingly, we found significantly lower levels of amyloid in the frontotemporal areas of subsyndromally depressed A\u03b2\u2212 subjects. These preliminary findings suggest that two different \"dementia\" pathways can occur in late-life depressed subjects: (1) depression as a prodrome in the \"normal\" amyloid pathway, and (2) depression without amyloid accumulation, in which subjective memory complaints may play an important role [33] ."}, {"section_title": "Amyloid levels in relation to FDG metabolism", "text": "Our results indicate that relative hypermetabolism is present in subsyndromally depressed A\u03b2+ MCI subjects within a similar domain of frontal brain areas revealing elevated amyloidosis in contrast to the findings in nondepressed subjects. Increased glucose metabolism may reveal an inflammatory process in the brain [34] , possibly caused by the amyloid pathology, or alternatively reflecting a metabolic compensation in still healthy neurons embedded in amyloid-affected networks [35] . A correlation between binding of ligands such as [ 11 C]PBR28 for the 18-kDa translocator protein and AD severity has recently been documented, lending support to the inflammation hypothesis [36] . It is noteworthy that [ 11 C]PBR28 and [ 11 C]PiB binding also correlate with clinical scores after PVE correction, indicating that they reveal pathology rather than simply atrophy. In A\u03b2\u2212 MCI subjects with depressive symptoms FDG metabolism was generally inconspicuous. This finding probably explains the inconsistent results among previous FDG PET studies regarding late-life depression where A\u03b2 status was not hitherto considered. Both hypermetabolism [11] [12] [13] 24] and hypometabolism [14] [15] [16] [17] have been reported in late-life depressed subjects in cognitively preserved and impaired subjects and AD patients. Moreover, PVE correction was not applied in these FDG PET studies, so that atrophy, as may occur in depressed subjects [37, 38] , may have resulted in spurious findings of hypometabolism."}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "The NPI-Q was used to diagnose late-life depression because there was no clinical diagnosis of depression, and especially no gold standard structured clinical interview data available. Therefore, the low sensitivity of the single item has to be considered as a limitation. The geriatric depression scale (GDS) might have been a reasonable alternative. However, a GDS score >5 was defined as an exclusion criterion for ADNI enrolment. Therefore, we think that defining clinical groups by the GDS might have led to more selection bias due to this exclusion criterion, and we consequently focused on NPI-Q. In addition, late-life depression as a clinical syndrome may include heterogeneous subtypes, including common vascular depression [39] , which are probably different from amyloid pathology. Subjects with depressive symptoms often suffer from additional neuropsychiatric symptoms such as anxiety and apathy [40, 41] , which may be independent factors contributing to amyloid or metabolic status. However, had we restricted our search to patients positive for depressive symptoms only, the group size would have been too small to allow statistical comparison. Therefore, we compared our depressed subjects consistently against nondepressed controls irrespective of the presence of other NPI-Q categories to minimize this bias.\nFinally, antidepressant medication was documented only from the time of the baseline PET scan irrespective of prior duration, and 62 % of depressed subjects and 5 % of nondepressed subjects were treated with mostly serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI). Therefore, no final conclusions can be drawn as to the effect of previous SSRI treatment on amyloid levels in our subjects. However, according to a recent report in cognitively normal subjects [32] , amyloid levels in SSRI-treated subjects would be expected to be decreased. Therefore, the significance of our findings is more likely to have been attenuated by this circumstance than positively biased. Longitudinal amyloid PET imaging in a prospective study of SSRI-treated and untreated late-life depressed subjects would be of great value."}]
