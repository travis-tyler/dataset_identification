[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "\ue062e disease that would, upon the suggestion of his colleague Dr. Emil \ufffdraepelin, eventually bear his name was \ufffdrst described by Aloysius \"Alois\" Alzheimer in 1907, based upon his observations and treatment of a 51-year-old patient, August \"D\" [1] . In addition to short-term memory loss, symptoms included unusual behavior and the neuropathological characteristics which have become hallmarks of the disease [1] . \ue062ese features include extracellular plaques formed from cleaved amyloid precursor protein (APP) and intracellular tangles of hyperphosphorylated microtubule associated protein tau (MAPT) [2] [3] [4] . APP is an integral membrane protein with wide expression throughout the body, which is concentrated in neuronal synapses [5] . Although the primary function of APP is not fully understood, it has been implicated in neurite extension and synaptic plasticity. \ue062e tau protein is expressed primarily in neurons, where it stabilizes microtubules that are responsible for axonal transport [6] .\nAlzheimer's disease is a progressive, neurodegenerative disease that is ultimately and invariably fatal, unless another cause of death intervenes. Although the clinical course is heterogeneous, there are a number of common features in addition to the characteristic extracellular plaques and neuro\ufffdbulary tangles. Early symptoms are o\ufffden mistaken as part of normal aging, or manifestations of stress [7] . \ue062e most common symptom that is \ufffdrst noticed is a loss of short-term memory. As the disease progresses, symptoms may include aggression, irritability, confusion, and language problems, as well as loss of long-term memory. In later stages of the disease, patients become withdrawn and ultimately are completely unable to care for themselves [7] . Neuropathological changes include loss of neurons and synapses in the cerebral cortex and certain subcortical regions. \ue062is loss results in gross atrophy of the affected regions, including degeneration in the temporal and parietal lobes, as well as parts of the frontal cortex and cingulate gyrus [8] . MRI and PET analyses have documented atrophy of speci\ufffdc brain regions, particularly the hippocampus, as individuals progress from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease [9, 10] .\nAlzheimer's disease is the most common form of agerelated neurodegenerative dementia and one of the most serious health problems in the industrialized world. More than 35 million individuals suffer from dementia globally, and the majority of these are diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's disease is also a major public health problem in the United States. \ue062e Alzheimer's Association reports that in 2011, 5.4 million individuals were diagnosed with Alzheimer's in the US, with an estimated prevalence ranging from 6%-12% of individuals aged 65 years and older [11] . \ue062is \ufffdgure is expected to increase to over 10 million over the next 25 years, as individuals born between 1946 and 1964 begin reaching the age where they are at risk of developing the disease. Alzheimer's is the 6th leading cause of death in America and the 5th leading cause of death for those over 65 [11] . Currently available therapies provide short-term symptomatic relief but do not slow disease progression. In order for novel therapeutic approaches to be created, greater knowledge regarding the underlying etiology of the disease is needed. \ue062e \ufffdnancial costs of Alzheimer's currently exceed $183 billion annually in the US, and an additional $210 billion worth of unpaid care is provided by friends and family members of patients [11] . \ue062ere are two types of Alzheimer's disease: familial (also known as early onset) and sporadic (also known as late onset). Familial Alzheimer's disease is inherited in a Mendelian fashion, with little in\ufffduence from the environment. In contrast, while genetics play a large role in the development and expression of late onset Alzheimer's disease, nongenetic factors are also very important. To date, there is a large literature documenting that obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and related factors, as well as cerebral and systemic in\ufffdammation increase the risk for late onset Alzheimer's disease, as well as lower the age at which symptoms \ufffdrst appear."}, {"section_title": "Familial Alzheimer's Disease", "text": "Familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) is expressed as a Mendelian trait with dominant inheritance. FAD is relatively rare, accounting for less than 5% of the total Alzheimer's disease burden [11, 14] . \ue062e Alzheimer's Association estimates that in 2011, approximately 200,000 individuals were afflicted with FAD in the US. A diagnosis is typically made when patients are in their \ufffd\ue09dies or sixties. However, there are instances of FAD onset at a much younger age. In one famous and particularly tragic example within an extended Columbian family, disease onset occurs in the mid-forties and as early as the early thirties [14] . \ue062e mutation responsible in this Columbian family (Presenilin 1 E280A) is known in other FAD families with a more typical age at onset.\nTo date, more than 160 highly penetrant but rare mutations have been described in three genes (amyloid precursor protein, presenilin 1, and presenilin 2) that cause familial Alzheimer's disease (Table 1) . Each of these genes will be discussed later."}, {"section_title": "Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP)", "text": ". \ue062e function of APP is not completely understood. However, it has been implicated in neuronal development and synaptic formation and repair and has been shown to be upregulated a\ue09der neuronal injury. \ue062e gene encoding APP is located on chromosome 21q21.3. \ue062e gene consists of 19 exons and covers approximately 240 kilobases of DNA. \ue062e full-length APP matures in the Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum, prior to being inserted into the plasma membrane. \ue062e resulting protein is between 365 and 770 amino acids in length. It is expressed in numerous tissues, and at least eight isoforms are created by alternate splicing of exons 1-13, 13a, and 14-18. \ue062e most abundant isoforms are APP695 (exons 1-6, 9-18), APP751 (exons 1-7, 9-18), and APP770 (exons 1-18). All of the transcripts produce a multidomain protein with a single membrane-spanning region. APP751 and APP770 differ from APP695 in that they contain exon seven, which encodes a serine protease inhibitor domain. APP695 is the predominant isoform in neuronal tissues, whereas APP751 is the predominant isoform elsewhere. Full-length APP is processed into a number of fragments through a series of proteolytic cleavages by alpha-, betaand gamma-secretase. Cleavage by alpha-secretase creates a fragment that is not associated with plaques or Alzheimer's. However, cleavage by beta-, and gamma-secretases creates beta-amyloid, which is encoded by exons 16 and 17 and is 39 to 42 amino acids in length. It is the beta-amyloid fragment that forms the extracellular plaques that are the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease.\nAPP was initially implicated in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease by a number of facts. First, the primary component of the extracellular plaques that characterize the disease is the amyloid protein. Tanzi and colleagues and Robakis et al. demonstrated in 1987 that the form of APP that is localized in plaques was derived from a larger protein that is encoded by a gene located on chromosome 21 [15, 16] . Second, chromosome 21 is duplicated in Down's syndrome patients, who typically develop Alzheimer's in the \ufffd\ue09dh decade of life. An extra copy of the APP gene is duplicated along with the other chromosome 21 genes in Down's syndrome, which further implicated the APP gene in Alzheimer's pathology.\n\ue062e beta-amyloid that forms the core of amyloid plaques consists of aggregates of a 4.2 kDa polypeptide and is the same in Alzheimer's and older Down's syndrome patients. \ue062e existence of this fragment, along with the details of how it is produced from the full-length protein, was resolved in a series of experiments in the mid-eighties by Tanzi, Masters, Robakis, Kang, Glenner, and Wong ( Figure 1 age [17] . Either the resulting plaques, or perhaps the soluble oligomers, are neurotoxic and precipitate hyperphosphorylation of the tau protein, as well as other events that occur downstream in the disease process, including pruning of the dendritic tree and synaptic dysfunction. \ue062ese changes result in neuronal loss, dementia, and ultimately death. Lustbader et al. demonstrated that beta-amyloid interacted with amyloid beta-binding alcohol dehydrogenase (ABAD) to induce mitochondrial toxicity in Alzheimer's disease patients and in transgenic mice [18] . Crystallography showed that binding of beta-amyloid by ABAD deformed the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) binding site and prevented activation. Furthermore, inhibiting interactions between beta-amyloid and ABAD suppressed the generation of free radicals and beta-amyloid induced apoptosis within neurons.\nLinkage was detected between FAD and markers on chromosome 21 near the APP gene in 1987 [19] , but subsequent studies failed to detect this association in families with late onset Alzheimer's disease [20] . An association between a missense mutation in the APP gene and FAD in a large kindred was detected in 2006 by Goate [21] . However, nonallelic heterogeneity was detected in this study as well as many others, implicating additional genes in the pathogenesis of familial Alzheimer's disease [20] [21] [22] .\nAPP mutations account for a minority of FAD cases but have also been shown to cause cerebral amyloid angiopathy. In a multicenter study of familial and sporadic Alzheimer's disease, Tanzi and colleagues concluded that mutations in the APP gene account for a small portion of FAD cases [23] . In a similar study, Kamino et al. also found that APP mutations account for a small fraction of FAD [24] . In affected members of 2 families with early onset Alzheimer's disease-1, Goate et al. identi\ufffded a heterozygous mutation in the APP gene (V717I) [25] . \ufffdaux and others identi\ufffded mutations in the APP gene among affected members in \ufffdve of 31 families with FAD [26] . Combined with the results of earlier studies, the authors estimated that 16% of FAD is attributable to mutations in the APP gene [26] .\n\ue062ere have been extensive studies of the effects of APP mutations, particularly those occurring at amino acid 717. Suzuki et al. reported that 3 such mutations (V717I, V717F, and V717G) were consistently associated with a 1.5-to 1.9-fold increase in the generation of longer beta-amyloid fragments, which formed insoluble amyloid \ufffdbrils more rapidly than shorter fragments [27] . Yamatsuji and colleagues demonstrated that expression of the cytoplasmic domain of any of the mutations at amino acid 717 (V717I, V717F, and V717G) induced G protein-mediated nucleosomal DNA fragmentation in cultured neuronal cells [28] .\nIn a notable recent discovery, Jonsson and colleagues discovered a rare mutation (A673T) in the APP gene that was protective against Alzheimer's disease [29] . \ue062e mutation was discovered in a search for rare coding variants within whole-genome sequence data from 1,795 Icelanders. \ue062is A673T mutation was also found to be protective against cognitive decline among elderly without Alzheimer's disease. \ue062is substitution was adjacent to the beta-secretase site in APP, and resulted in a 40% reduction in the formation of amyloidogenic peptides."}, {"section_title": "Presenilins 1 and 2 (PSEN1 and PSEN2", "text": "). \ue062e presenilins are important determinants of gamma-secretase activity and are responsible for proteolytic cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and NOTCH receptor proteins [12] . Gamma-secretase is a multimeric protein complex consisting of PSEN1 or PSEN2, nicastrin, and APH1 [12] . All mutations in PSEN1 increase cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein by gamma-secretase, thereby increasing the production of the beta-amyloid 42 fragment [13, [30] [31] [32] [33] . Presenilin 1 is an evolutionarily conserved membrane protein that is present in Drosophila [34] and C. elegans [35] . \ue062e PSEN1 gene, which is located on chromosome 14q24.2, was identi\ufffded as an Alzheimer's disease locus in 1995 by positional cloning [36] . \ue062e PSEN2 gene is located on chromosome 1q42.13 and has signi\ufffdcant sequence homology and very similar structural organization to PSEN1 (approximately 60% overall identity). In fact, it was the high degree of sequence identity between the two genes that led to the identi\ufffdcation of PSEN2 during the cloning of PSEN1 [37] . However, it seems that the presenilin genes encode proteins with overlapping, but distinct functions. For example, mutations in both presenilin genes result in increased beta-amyloid [30, 32] , yet functional PSEN2 does not rescue APP or NOTCH signaling defects observed in PSEN1 null animals [38] .\nEvidence that presenilin genes were involved in gammasecretase activity and hence in amyloid precursor protein processing was \ufffdrst obtained in 2000 when Li and colleagues suggested that PSEN1 and PSEN2 comprised the active site of gamma-secretase [39] . In their experiments, gammasecretase activity coeluted with PSEN1 on gel exclusion chromatography. In addition, they observed that an anti-PSEN1 antibody immunoprecipitated active gamma-secretase. In the same year, Kopan and Goate determined that PSEN1 and PSEN2 both appear to be active gamma-secretase sites that reside in different complexes [40] . \ue062e authors proposed that regulation of cleavage may depend on the speci\ufffdc pro\ufffdle of proteins present in the multimeric gamma-secretase complex [40] . Lee et al. reported that nicastrin and presenilin heterodimers associate with APH1A and APH1B to form the gamma-secretase complex that is responsible for the proteolytic cleavage of many membrane proteins, including APP and NOTCH [12] .\nCai and colleagues reported that PSEN1 binds and recruits phospholipase D1 (PLD1) to the trans-Golgi network (TGN). Furthermore, expression of PLD1 in mouse neuroblastoma (N2a) cells was found to be inversely correlated with gamma-secretase-mediated beta-amyloid generation [41] . Additional studies by the same lab showed that overexpression of catalytically active PLD1 promoted generation of beta-amyloid-containing vesicles from the TGN [42] . Taken together, these observations showed that PLD1 regulates intracellular trafficking of beta-amyloid, distinct from its effect on gamma-secretase activity.\nActivity of PSEN1 and PSEN2 is essential for the formation of beta-amyloid 42. Transgenic mice that overexpressed mutant presenilin-1 showed an increase in betaamyloid 42. However, mice overexpressing a wildtype version of presenilin-1 did not show a similar increase [31] . \ue062ese results suggested that mutations in presenilin cause Alzheimer's disease through a deleterious gain of function that increases the amount of beta-amyloid 42 that is deposited in the brain. Support for this model of Alzheimer's etiology was provided by Davis et al. who showed that amyloid deposition was equivalent in the brains of wildtype mice and those with a loss of functional Psen1 allele [43] . Finally, Qian and colleagues showed that the brains of mice carrying the human PSEN1 A246E mutation showed increased levels of beta-amyloid 42 [44] . Citron and colleagues noted that several lines of evidence strongly support the conclusion that progressive cerebral deposition of beta-amyloid protein is a seminal event in familial Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis [32] . Both in vitro and in vivo data demonstrate that FADlinked presenilin mutations directly or indirectly alter the level of gamma-but not alpha-or beta-secretase, resulting in increased production of beta-amyloid 42 which may lead to cerebral beta-amyloidosis and AD [32] .\nNearly 200 variant PSEN1 alleles have been detected (http://www.molgen.ua.ac.be/ADMutations). \ue062e vast majority of these are missense mutations, which alter the protein sequence by a single amino acid. Although a few splicesite mutations and insertion-deletion variants have also been discovered, no nonsense mutations, which result in a truncated and nonfunctional protein, have been observed to cause Alzheimer's disease [45, 46] .\nRelative to PSEN1, a much smaller number of mutations (approximately two dozens) have been observed to date in PSEN2 in families segregating FAD (http://www.molgen .ua.ac.be/ADMutations). Similar to PSEN1, these are missense mutations with a deleterious gain of function effect. \ue062e range in age at onset is much more variable within families segregating PSEN2 mutations, relative to those segregating disease alleles in APP or PSEN1 [47] [48] [49] [50] . In families that develop FAD due to PSEN2 mutations, the age at onset ranges from 40 to 85 years of age. In contrast, individuals belonging to families that develop Alzheimer's due to mutations in APP or PSEN1 experience an age at disease onset between 35 to 55 (PSEN1) or 45 to 65 years of age (APP)."}, {"section_title": "Late Onset Alzheimer's Disease", "text": "In contrast to FAD, which is inherited in a Mendelian dominant fashion as described earlier, sporadic or late onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) is etiologically heterogeneous and results from a combination of many genetic and environmental factors. Although there is evidence of a strong genetic component to disease risk, a large percentage of the genetic risk remains unidenti\ufffded. \ue062e heritability of LOAD was estimated to be 79% in a large populationbased study of Swedish twins [51] . However, until quite recently, only a single gene had been reliably associated with increased risk for Alzheimer's disease. \ue062e epsilon allele in the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE4) has been associated with substantially increased risk for LOAD as well as an earlier age of disease onset [52, 53] . A large number of additional polymorphisms have been associated with risk for LOAD, but replication of these associations has been inconsistent.\nA search for \"Alzheimer's\" in the Gene Card database yields 1890 hits. \ue062ese polymorphisms are located in genes regulating in\ufffdammation, oxidative stress, vascular biology, and protease function, among others (a complete list is available at http://www.alzgene.org/). It is likely that the failure to universally reproduce these associations is due at least in part to incomplete phenotypic characterization of study participants, inadequate samples sizes, and incomplete penetrance of risk alleles [54, 55] ."}, {"section_title": "Genome-Wide Association Studies", "text": "Although nearly 2000 genes have been implicated in the etiology of late onset Alzheimer's disease over the past two decades, it was only in 2009 that two large-scale genome-wide association studies replicated associations between LOAD and genes other than APOE (Table 2 ). In these studies, which were published back to back in Nature Genetics [56, 57] It is interesting that BIN1 showed a nonsigni\ufffdcant trend for association in the previous studies by Harold et al. and Lambert et al. \ue062e signi\ufffdcant signal for BIN1 in the metaanalysis a\ufffder a nonsigni\ufffdcant trend for association in the two initial GWAS studies was a clear indication of the tremendous sample sizes that are required to detect Alzheimer's risk genes outside of APOE. Current studies underway through the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP) will ultimately evaluate over 60,000 participants including more than 30,000 Alzheimer's cases, roughly twice the size of the previous largest effort by Seshadri et al.

CNVs offer an alternate genetic marker map for disease association studies. CNVs are major contributors to genetic variance; thus, it is conceivable that they may confer susceptibility to or directly cause disease [59] . CNVs in\ufffduence gene expression, phenotypic variation and adaptation by altering gene dosage [59] . A recent study of gene expression variation as a model of complex phenotypes found that 18% of gene expression traits were associated with CNVs [60] . With regard to Alzheimer's disease, Brouwers et al. reported a signi\ufffdcant association between CNVs in the CR1 gene and increased risk for Alzheimer's [61] . In this study, a Flanders-Belgian cohort of 1,887 individuals was used as a discovery set combined with a French validation cohort of 2,003 individuals. CNV within the gene was observed to produce two CR1 isoforms. One of these was associated with increased Alzheimer's risk ( for the combined cohorts). \ue062e authors hypothesized that the association with the high copy number variant was caused by additional C3b/C4b and cofactor sites [61] . In addition, Szigeti and colleagues detected signi\ufffdcant association between a high copy number segment on chromosome 14 (14q11.2) in the region of the olfactory receptor and increased risk for Alzheimer's disease. \ue062is \ufffdnding is of interest due to the early involvement of the olfactory lobes in Alzheimer's neuropathology [62, 63] ."}, {"section_title": "LOAD Genes", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Apolipoprotein E (APOE)", "text": ". \ue062e APOE protein is 299 amino acids long and is synthesized principally in the liver. In the nervous system, nonneuronal cells (astroglia and microglia) are the primary producers of APOE. It transports lipoproteins, fat-soluble vitamins, and cholesterol into the lymphatic system and then into the blood. APOE is the ligand for the LDL receptor, LRP (LDL-related protein), and VLDLreceptor, all of which are preferentially expressed by neurons. Given its involvement in lipid transport, it is perhaps not surprising that the role for APOE as a disease gene was \ufffdrst recognized with respect to cardiovascular disease [64] [65] [66] .\n\ue062e APOE gene is located on chromosome 19q13.2 in a cluster with apolipoprotein C1 and apolipoprotein C2. \ue062e gene is on the small side, containing 3,597 nucleotides and four exons [67] . \ue062ree primary isoforms exist for apolipoprotein E (E2, E3, and E4), which are encoded by 3 alleles (epsilon 2, 3, and 4). \ue062ese isoforms differ in the amino acid sequence at 2 sites: residues 112 and 158. At these sites, the E2, E3, and E4 isoforms contain cysteine/cysteine, cysteine/arginine, and arginine/arginine residues, respectively [67] [68] [69] . \ue062e absolute allele frequencies vary widely by race and ethnicity [70] [71] [72] , with the E4 allele showing a curvilinear relationship to latitude, with lowest frequency in the mid-latitudes [73] . Eisenberg and colleagues, who reported this relationship, have suggested that it is due to a reduced metabolic rate and hence lowers cholesterol requirements in more moderate climates [73] .\n\ue062e effect size for the APOE4 allele is among the largest for any multifactorial, oligogenic (complex) disease. Individuals homozygous for APOE4 are 10 to 20 times as likely to develop LOAD as APOE4 negative individuals [74, 75] , and there is a gene-dosage effect observed between increasing copies of the E4 allele and earlier age of disease onset [76] . In contrast, individuals who carry the APOE 2 allele have a lower risk for Alzheimer's disease relative to other genotypes [77] . However, LOAD is clearly a heterogeneous disease, as one third of Alzheimer's patients are APOE4 negative. Interestingly, health risks associated with carriage of the APOE4 allele are not speci\ufffdc to Alzheimer's disease. A worse outcome has been reported for APOE4 carriers following traumatic brain injury [78] , selective cardiac bypass surgery [79] , and spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage [80] .\nEven though the APOE4 allele has one of the greatest effect sizes of any gene associated with an oligogenic disease, the polymorphism accounts for less than half the genetic variance in Alzheimer's disease risk, strongly suggesting that additional Alzheimer's disease genes remain to be identi\ufffded.\nData from several recent large GWAS studies support this contention [56, 57, 81, 82] ."}, {"section_title": "Clusterin (CLU).", "text": "Clusterin is a 75-kDa apolipoprotein that is widely expressed throughout the body, particularly in the brain [83] .

Previous efforts have involved familybased linkage studies, population-based genome-wide association studies, and a host of candidate gene association tests. Recently, GWAS methods have been extended to very large numbers of participants. While it is true that one way to identify Alzheimer's genes with vanishingly small effect sizes is to employ ever-increasing numbers of participants in collaborative studies and meta-analyses, this approach relies upon the detection of marginal effects of SNPs within a single haplotype block. Even though sample sizes for recent GWAS studies are in the tens of thousands of participants, which supply an impressive amount of statistical power, this approach remains largely unable to resolve gene-gene interactions, which critically underlie the common gene-common disease hypothesis. Detection of multiple interacting loci requires a more sophisticated analytical approach.\nOne method for detecting interacting alleles within biological pathways is network enrichment analysis, which has also been termed pathway analysis [146] . \ue062is technique was originally developed for the analysis of microarrayed gene expression data [146] . \ue062e basis of this analytical method is to identify biological pathways, rather than individual markers or genes that are associated with the outcome of interest [147] . First, standard GWAS data are generated. Next, a gene assignment is made for as many markers as possible, and an adjustment is made for the number of markers per gene. \ue062en, genes are assigned to prede\ufffdned biological pathways, using databases such as the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) or the Gene Otology (GO) network. Finally, pathways or networks are evaluated for a signi\ufffdcant overrepresentation of markers associated with the outcome of interest, relative to what would be expected at random.\nOne of the \ufffdrst applications of pathway analysis to Alzheimer's disease was published by Lambert et al. in 2010 [148] . In this study, Alligator and GenGen/KEGG so\ue09dware packages were used to analyze GWAS data derived from 2,032 Alzheimer's cases and 5,328 controls of French Caucasian ancestry. \ufffdoth enrichment approaches identi\ufffded a role for immunological dysfunction in the development of Alzheimer's disease [148] . While this association was far from novel, con\ufffdrmation of a role for in\ufffdammation via pathway analysis supports the utility and value of pathway analysis methods in the study of Alzheimer's disease. In a second study from the same group in the same year, Hong and colleagues reported the involvement of intracellular transmembrane protein transport in Alzheimer's [149] . Of interest in the Hong et al. study was evidence of a functional role for TOMM40 in the development of AD. TOMM40 is the channel-forming subunit of the mitochondrial outer membrane translocase complex. Variation in the length of a poly-T homopolymer in this gene has been implicated in Alzheimer's etiology [150] [151] [152] [153] [154] ; however, the validity of this association has been controversial due to strong linkage disequilibrium between TOMM40 and APOE, which complicates interpretation of the signal [150, 155, 156] . In a more recent pathway analysis of GWAS data from 742 participants enrolled in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) project, Ramanan et al. identi\ufffded a number of genes, pathways and networks [157] . In this study, the outcome variable was not disease status, but rather a composite memory score that was constructed from the ADNI neuropsychological battery. Using the GSA-SNP so\ue09dware tool, 27 canonical pathways were identi\ufffded that were over enriched relative to the composite memory score [157] . Among the set of enriched pathways were biological processes known to be related to memory consolidation such as receptor-mediated calcium signaling and long-term potentiation. Additional processes that were enriched against the composite memory score included cell adhesion and neuronal differentiation, as well as glucose signaling and in\ufffdammation. Furthermore, a large gene set was identi\ufffded with MetaCore so\ue09dware that was centered on SP1 transcriptional regulation [157] .\nPathway enrichment analysis has only recently been applied to Alzheimer's disease and most of these studies have been conducted in what are now relatively small cohorts. It is likely that as GWAS data are developed for large international cohorts, greater insight will be gained from interrogation of these data by pathway enrichment techniques. \ue062e combination of large sample sizes and sophisticated analytical methods such as pathway enrichment analysis is likely to produce many novel targets for the treatment and therapy of Alzheimer's disease."}, {"section_title": "Pharmacogenetics", "text": "Antidementia drugs are metabolized by the cytochrome p450 (CYP) gene family [158, 159] .

Alzheimer's has been one of the most difficult diseases to defeat, and there are currently no proven effective means of cure or prevention. \ue062e genetic causes run the entire range from a Mendelian dominant transmission in FAD to risk factors for a complex multifactorial and etiologically heterogeneous disease in LOAD. In addition, a number of genetic polymorphisms are known to impact response to ant-dementia medication through pharmacogenetic effects. While many (perhaps most) causal alleles have been identi\ufffded for FAD, only roughly half of the genetic variation for LOAD has been reliably identi\ufffded. Future work toward discovering this missing heritability will likely involve studies of epigenetic phenomena, such as methylation and acetylation, as well as the control of gene expression by micro-RNA species. \ue062e advent of genome-wide methods has led to the identi\ufffdcation of several risk loci for LOAD, in addition to the welldocumented association with the APOE4 allele.
