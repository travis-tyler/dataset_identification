Introduction", "text": "In this article, we propose a new database allowing the measurement of the evolution of students' achievements in a large set of countries. The main reason for focusing and providing quantitative estimates of students' learning achievements lies in the desire to identify the direction and strength of the causal link between schooling quality and economic performance -as it is now acknowledged that educational quality matters both for wage levels (at the microlevel) and economic growth (at the macrolevel)."}, {"section_title": "1", "text": "What we actually develop here is a standardized measure of pupils' achievements in several key competencies (reading, mathematics and sciences) in primary and secondary education at several points in time. We use the results of the various international assessments available (by the way also enlarging the geographical scope of such analysis as usually carried out by using results of tests carried out in Africa and Latin America not often used in the literature so far) to build a standardized score of those achievements as a proxy of the education system quality.\nOur methodology aims at improving the seminal work done by and Barro (2001) , and consists of a major update of a previous work by . In their pioneering paper, used direct results from International Student Achievement Tests (ISATs) without any specific methodology for adjusting potential differences between all the series. They instead used a regression technique -i.e. the seemingly unrelated regression -which allows obtaining different constants between each test, and hence to allow for potential differences between tests over years and over skills. We begin our analysis by using these studies.\nAnother method of anchoring has been used by Hanushek and Kimko (2000) . These authors adjusted ISATs between 1964 and 1995 by using results from NAEP (National Assessment of Educational Progress 2 ). Their methodology is only based on US scores, and the data are limited to the restricted period 1964-1995. A recent paper by Hanushek and Woessmann (2012) aimed at correcting some of these imperfections by using an approach that assumes stability over time of the variance of quality of student achievement in a restricted number of OECD countries. The authors suggest two criteria for a group of countries to serve as a standardization benchmark for performance variation over time. First, the countries have to be member states of the relatively homogenous and economically advanced group of OECD countries in the whole period of ISATs observations. Second, the countries should have had a substantial enrolment in secondary education already in 1964. Then, the authors suggest 13 countries that meet both of these measures of stability, which are named 'OECD Standardization Group' (OSG) of countries.\n3 Hanushek and Woessmann (2012) assume that the cross-country variations among the OSG countries do not vary substantially since 1964. By using this assumption, they build new indicators of student achievements and educational quality. Their main measure of cognitive skills is a simple average of all standardized math and science test scores of the ISATs in which a country participated. Their database includes combined measure for the 77 countries that have always participated in any of the math and science tests.\nAs the authors explain in their paper, a major issue with this methodology concerns countries that are far from the measured OECD performance. In particular, countries far off the scale of the original test scores may not be well represented because the tests may be too hard and thus not very informative for them. This bias may be more important when analyses are focused on developing countries, which is the case of our study.\nMoreover, the methodology used -i.e. the 'OSG of countries' -does not take into account several improvements made by ISATs since 1995. The International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA) and the OECD teams prepared modern ISATs in order to allow for intertemporal comparisons. By using another methodology, Hanushek and Woessmann (2012) chose a specific approach and neglected the recent improvements made by psychometricians, such as the Item Response Theory (IRT). Moreover, they do not clearly show to what extent their main assumption -i.e. the variation between the OSG of countries is stable -is corroborated by results from modern ISATs as these permit to compare countries' performance over time.\nAnother limit deals with the absence of Regional Student Achievement Tests (RSATs) in their database. Hanushek and Woessmann (2012) only focused on ISATs since the methodology used is based on developed economies. In our article, we provide an alternative methodology that enables the possibility to include several regional assessments. As these are focused on developing countries, our study permits to analyse more deeply the question of universal primary education and allow for specific analyses for developing economies.\nWhen compared with previous research, our approach innovates in several ways. First, we use RSATs such as LLECE, SACMEQ or PASEC, 4 which were never used in previous papers. This enables us to obtain original data on the quality of student achievement for a larger number of developing countries, and especially for African and Latin American countries. Our methodology consists of anchoring ISATs with the results of the United States in the US NAEP for only the very first ISATs. In parallel to this anchoring, recent achievement tests -for instance, the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) -permit us to make comparisons of country performance over time. Last but not least, adjusting RSATs needs a new methodology that uses countries participating in at least one ISAT and one RSAT. By using these countries' performance in both tests, we make an anchoring of RSATs with ISATs. We therefore combine these new series -i.e. the RSATs -by using scores for countries that took part in at least one ISAT for the same period. The main advantage of this specific methodology is both to adjust old achievement tests and to permit to take into account future achievement tests. Hence, our database will be updated when new international and regional achievement tests will be available in the future. 5 Differences can be found with a previous publication on this database. First of all, the use of trends on pupils' performance between 1965 and 1980 has been made possible by using the micro databases of IEA's pioneering assessments. In the first version, we only based our statistics on global means published in reports. Another change is our choice not to include data from an assessment for which there are no microdata available in order to diminish measurement error. This leads to the exclusion of International Assessment of Educational Progress (IAEP) 6 and Monitoring Learning Achievement (MLA) assessments. Moreover, the inclusion of more developing countries has been made possible by updating the data with recent regional student assessments such as the SACMEQ III, LLECE II or PASEC II assessments. Another change concerns the possibility of distinguishing between males and females and rural and urban areas. Finally, we propose to complement standard means of student achievements with proportions of students reaching specific competency levels in order to track for different goals (such as the Education for All goal). We obtain two complementary databases. The first database gives the opportunity to compare student performance between countries for each level of education by computing an average score for quality of student achievement between 1965 and 2010 (Database 1). This database includes quality scores for 103 countries/areas in primary education and 111 countries/areas in secondary education. The second database allows us to compare the global change in quality of student achievement over time for a long-term period. This long-term table includes quality scores from 1965 to 2010 for 150 countries/areas and more than 800 different scores divided by countries, levels and years (Database 2). Each data set is presented for general sample, by gender and by type of location. Moreover, besides the mean score for each subgroup, we provide proportion of pupils for two predefined benchmarks (i.e. the 'minimum level' benchmark and the 'advanced level' benchmark)."}, {"section_title": "II. Data and Methodology", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "A brief presentation of international and regional learning achievement tests", "text": "This section describes the various international learning achievement tests that may be used to construct our indicators, named 'indicators of quality of student achievement' (IQSA). We identify seven groups of international surveys in which 105 countries have participated. These groups can be divided into two subgroups. The first subgroup consists of international assessments, while the second subgroup consists of regional assessments. Detailed information on these assessments is provided in Table 1 . Here, we will only make a short presentation of the various existing learning assessments. More information can be obtained in Appendix A.\nThe IEA was the first body to measure individual learning achievement for international comparative purposes in the early 1960s. The surveys include the highly regarded TIMSS and Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS) . TIMSS test aims at evaluating skills of students in grades 4 and 8 7 in mathematics and science, while PIRLS is based on a test based on reading in grade 4. Another well-known international assessment is PISA (Programme for International Student Assessment). The OECD launched its PISA in 1997. More generally, PISA has assessed the skills of 15-year-old pupils every three years since 2000 in countries that together account for almost 90% of the global economy -i.e. a major part of the world's GDP. Until now, four rounds of PISA are available (2000, 2003, 2006 and 2009) . Moreover, data for additional countries in PISA 2009+ have been included in our data set.\nTwo other international assessments are available. Drawing on the experience of the NAEP, the IAEP comprises two surveys first conducted in 1988 and 1991. Under a joint UNESCO and UNICEF project, learning achievements have been assessed as part of the MLA programme on a vast geographical scale in more than 72 countries (Chinapah, 2003) . This programme of assessment is flexible and ranges from early childhood, basic and secondary education to non formal adult literacy. However, all of the data have not been published. Supplementing national reports, a separate report on MLA I was drafted for 11 African countries (Botswana, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Morocco, Mauritius, Niger, Senegal, Tunisia, Uganda and Zambia; see UNESCO, 2000) . As the microdata of IAEP and MLA are not available, we preferred not to include these assessments in our database.\nThree major regional assessments have been conducted in Africa and Latin America. The SACMEQ grew out of a very extensive national investigation of the quality of primary education in 15 African countries in 1995-1999, 2000-2002 and 2007 . Following a different approach, surveys under the Programme d'Analyse des Syst\u00e8mes Educatifs (PASEC, or 'Programme of Analysis of Education Systems') of the Conference of Ministers of Education of French-Speaking Countries (CONFEMEN) have been conducted in the French-speaking countries of sub-Saharan Africa since 1993. Finally, the network of national education systems in Latin American and Caribbean countries, known as the LLECE, was established in 1994 and is coordinated by the UNESCO Regional Bureau for Education in Latin America and the 7 A grade consists of a specific stage of instruction in initial education usually covered during an academic year. Students in the same grade are usually of similar age. This is also referred to as a 'class', 'cohort' or 'year' (glossary of UIS website available at http://glossary. uis.unesco.org/glossary/en/home). A new international database on education quality 1215\nCaribbean. Assessments conducted by the LLECE focused on learning achievements in reading, mathematics and science 8 in grades 3 and 4 9 in 13 countries of the subcontinent in 1998 and in grades 3 and 6 in 2006.\nAll achievements tests undertaken and the main information concerning them are summarized in Table 1 and presented in Appendix A. The methodology used to adjust them in order to yield comparable indicators is briefly presented below and in more detail in Appendix B.\nA methodology for the consolidated study of surveys Given the diversity of existing achievement tests, there is no single and comparable measure of pupils' achievement over all tests. On the contrary, ISATs and RSATs differ greatly in the definition of what a pupil should know in the respective skill tested. Therefore, we propose a methodology that enables the comparison between all existing assessments. Below, we present a short form of this methodology. The detailed methodology can be found in Appendix B.\nThis article is a major update of a previous publication in 2007 . When compared with our previous article, we made six major modifications:\n\u2022 We did not include surveys for which we do not have the micro data set in order to obtain more precise data. Hence, MLA and NAEP assessments are not included in our updated article.\n\u2022 While in the first version we used results from international reports for earlier assessments of IEA, we now use the micro data set. It allows us to obtain less biased results for years before 1980.\n\u2022 The methodology of anchoring has been improved by using recent results of the PISA assessments. Now, our methodology is also based on the measured progress of students' achievements over time instead of only using the simultaneous participation of countries to several assessments. It brings us the possibility to track trends in students' achievements between 1965 and 2010.\n\u2022 We include recent international and regional assessments that were not included in the previous version (such as PISA 2009, TIMSS 2007 or LLECE II).\n\u2022 Another change concerns the possibility to distinguish between male and female and rural and urban areas, which would allow us to analyse gender issues in potential future studies.\n\u2022 Finally, we propose to complement standard means of student achievements with proportions of students reaching specific competency levels in order to track for different policy goals (such as the 'Education for All' goal or the goal of 'innovation', which needs to track best-performing pupils all over the world).\nFor a more detailed explanation, please consult Appendix B. We proceed in five steps. First, we need to track the overall performance over time for IEA assessments. We need to obtain an anchored assessment that will provide possible future comparisons over time of pupils' results. As highlighted in the section 'A brief presentation of international and regional learning achievement tests', IEA organized several assessments since 1964 in mathematics, science (known as TIMSS tests since 1995) and reading (known as PIRLS tests since 2001). Unfortunately, IEA assessments prior to 1995 in mathematics and science and 2001 in reading are not directly comparable with further IEA tests. In order to adjust all IEA assessments, we propose to anchor them on an external assessment that provides comparable data over time.\nTo do this, we need data from another assessment that is comparable over time and that tests approximately the same population (Hanushek and Kimko (2000) used the same methodology). The NAEP can be used for this purpose. NAEP is the main instrument of evaluation in education in the United States. As NAEP began to test pupils aged 4 and 8 years from 1964 to 2007, we propose to anchor old IEA assessments on trends on US results in NAEP. Therefore, if the performance of the United States declined in NAEP and changed in another way in the IEA study, it would mean that the IEA study is upward or downward biased. In order to correct for this underestimate or overestimation, we propose to adjust old IEA studies according to trends on NAEP results. However, as recent IEA assessments permit over time comparison of performance levels, there is no specific reason to anchor results on NAEP results after this period (which is after TIMSS 1995 and PIRLS 2001 assessments). Hence, our panel data give exactly the same trends on students' performance between 1995 and 2007 for mathematics and science, which can be found in international reports of the IEA (see, for instance, Mullis et al., 2009) . Moreover, we also included data from PISA assessments. As our main methodology is based on IEA assessments, our article includes PISA results by using different anchoring procedures. First, we used the same way as done for TIMSS for adjusting PISA assessment. Indeed, the anchoring methodology was made on the basis of US results in both PISA and NAEP. As many countries took part in both PISA 2000 and TIMSS 1999/2003, we predicted scores for adjusted PISA 2000 in the TIMSS 1999 8 Science skill was included in the second round only. 9 A grade is a stage of instruction usually equivalent to one complete year. Hence, grade 3 represents the third year of compulsory schooling -i.e. of primary education in most countries."}, {"section_title": "1216", "text": "N. Altinok et al. Wu, 2010) . Another issue may concern the differences in levels of scoring between PISA and TIMSS. If we simply aggregate results from TIMSS and PISA for a given year (for instance, 2003), some slight differences may appear for some countries. In order to correct this possible issue, we based the inclusion of PISA results on the variation of performance for countries that took part in two or more rounds of PISA. Instead of predicting all PISA scores with TIMSS scores, our methodology includes results for countries based on the change of their performance in PISA assessments. Last but not least, adjusting RSAT needs a new methodology that uses countries participating in at least one ISAT and one RSAT. Since the United States did not take part in any regional student assessment, it is impossible to adjust the surveys with the NAEP assessment results. Our methodology relies on the possibility of combining results between ISATs and RSATs for countries that took part in both assessments. By using these countries' results in both tests, we make an anchoring of RSATs with ISATs. We therefore combine these new series -i.e. the RSATs -by using scores for countries that took part in at least one ISAT for the same period. The main advantage of this specific methodology is both to adjust old achievement tests and to permit to take into account future achievement tests. Hence, our database will be updated when new international and regional achievement tests will be made available in the future.\nWe obtain two complementary databases. For each observation, we provide data for the whole sample, by gender (female versus male) and by type of location (rural versus urban). Moreover, while the general data concern mean scores for each subgroup, we also provide data for the proportion of students reaching two specific levels. The first level represents 1 SD below the international average (i.e. 100 points from 500 points). Hence, the proportion of students who perform higher than 400 points represents the first benchmark. This group can be considered as reaching the 'minimum level' benchmark. Our second level deals with potential innovation and research development -or at least technological adaptation capabilities. Following the initial work by Hanushek and Woessmann (2012) , we define the most able pupils as pupils reaching the level of 600 points (i.e. 1 SD above the international mean). This group of students may innovate more (or contribute more to technological adaptation) than others and hence enhance economic growth (see Hanushek and Woessmann, 2012) .\nData set 1: panel data set. The first data set deals with trends on pupils' achievement. On top of that, we propose to analyse the global trends in schooling quality by creating new scores computed by combining achievement levels for secondary education.\n10 To our knowledge, this is the first study that aims to analyse and compare the trends in schooling quality. 11 The main methodology used in our article for analysing trends is based on variations between two evaluations over time for each country. Instead of aggregating results from different sources, we prefer to include variations of scores when it is possible. For instance, as some countries took part in both PISA 2003 and TIMSS 2003 assessments, one can have two options for including both results. The first option is to compute the arithmetic mean of both results. However, this methodology may lead to biases in the case of countries that took part in only one assessment, while others took part in both assessments. The second option is to base the anchoring on IEA assessments and to include only trends from other assessments like PISA. This methodology provides results quite similar to the ones found in international reports. 12 We preferred to choose the second option.\nData set 2: cross-sectional data set. The second data set consists of a cross-sectional database where we compute the mere arithmetic mean of the different scores obtained by countries at each educational level. For example, if a country has taken part in three different assessments concerning secondary education, its mean score for the three tests will be calculated. This procedure may be used to obtain IQSA at both primary and secondary levels (IQSA-PRI and IQSA-SEC, respectively, for the primary and secondary education levels), as well as to avoid some inconsistencies in student achievement levels from one test to the other. By calculating the mean of a country's scores for all adjusted assessments, it is possible to evaluate its mean performance for the period 1964 to 2010 10 While we combine both mathematics and science scores, we take into account only growth rates of scores in science for countries that did not took part in an evaluation in mathematics. Therefore, the scale always refers to mathematics, while for some countries trends are taken from science results. This is mainly the case for FIMS, SIMS, FISS and SISS achievement tests. Further assessments included both mathematics and science. 11 Although Hanushek and Woessmann (2012) propose to use a similar analysis, their study is only graphical and very few information is available regarding to the amplitude of trends in schooling quality. 12 For a few number of countries, we observed an opposite variation between TIMSS and PISA trends. As our methodology is based on IEA assessments, trends from TIMSS assessments are used in priority.\nwithout relying solely on one survey that might overestimate or underestimate pupils' actual achievement level.\nThe end result of these computations is a new international database on pupils' achievements in several key competencies that allows both cross-country comparisons and international comparisons of trends of students' achievements. We provide the results in Table 2 . The full data set can be downloaded from the following link: http:// www.beta-umr7522.fr/Datasets Although our approach tries to diminish as most as possible measurement error, it may still exist due to specific issues related to our methodology. We highlight below three main issues with the methodology used in our article. First, the nature of the skills assessed may differ from survey to survey, in which case the surveys may not be readily comparable. While some assessments (such as the IEA surveys) tend to measure learning achievement in terms of knowledge, Notes: The first column in each group represents the mean score. Mean scores for both primary and secondary education are calculated by aggregating both levels. We predicted scores for levels for which no data are available in order to obtain more consistent data for schooling performance. The second column in each group represent the share of pupils in each country reaching the 'minimum level' benchmark, defined as 1 SD below the international benchmark (i.e. 400 points in our data set). The third column ('advanced level') provides the proportion of pupils reaching at least 1 SD above the international benchmark (i.e. 600 points). See Appendix 2 for more details. 1220 N. Altinok et al.\nothers (such as the OECD surveys) focus more on the level of pupils' skills. In this particular case, any equivalence established may be distorted as the 'products' of education measured in this way are not clearly equivalent. As in our study, we only focus on assessments based on the knowledge dimension; this bias is altered. Moreover, the content of the tests is not strictly equivalent, which may bias cross-country comparisons when assessments are anchored. For example, IEA's TIMSS test in mathematics included the same domains tested in SACMEQ. The domains are, however, different compared with PASEC tests and LLECE-SERCE tests. Therefore, the anchoring supposes that a pupil who performs well in one assessment will probably perform in the same way in another assessment regardless of the exact content of tested skills. Despite this difference in the kind of 'acquisition' measured, the surveys provide a sound assessment of pupils' attainment in mathematics, science and reading.\nAnother limit concerns the difference regarding the target population. As shown in Section II, the grade tested differs between anchored assessments. Despite the fact that tests are adapted for each evaluated grade, comparing assessments in different grades may distort the cross-country comparisons (Saito and van Capelle, 2009 ). For instance, PASEC tests evaluate grade 5 pupils, whereas PIRLS focuses on grade 4 pupils. On the contrary, SACMEQ and LLECE-SERCE assess grade 6 pupils. Since each test prepared adapted items for each grade, cross-country comparisons within each assessment are possible. As the reference grade is grade 4, all regional assessments are made in another grade (grade 5 or grade 6). Our article supposes that the performance in one grade for a country (i.e. grade 5 or grade 6) would give the same level in the reference grade (here grade 4). Unfortunately, there is no specific research in this area that compares regional student assessments and international student assessments. However, some recent research comparing results from TIMSS and PISA showed that ranking of countries is quite similar despite the difference of the target population (Brown et al., 2005; Wu, 2010) .\nIn the following sections, we make use of our database to answer several key questions concerning the international evolution of schooling systems and the link with the economy. We successively address the issue of the evolution of schooling quality both in the short run and the long run (trends). We compare our results with the ones obtained in the literature using different proxies. We highlight the peculiar benefits of using our improved indicators."}, {"section_title": "III. Analysis of Trends on Schooling Quality", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "International comparison on schooling quality", "text": "Before examining trends in pupils' performances over time, it is interesting to study the possible differences in the average countries' performance in international learning achievement tests. As explained above, a single indicator of countries' performance is obtained by computing the mere arithmetic mean of the different scores obtained by countries at each educational level. This procedure may be used to obtain IQSA at both primary and secondary levels (IQSA-PRI and IQSA-SEC, respectively, for the primary and secondary education levels), as well as to avoid some inconsistencies in student achievement levels from one survey to the other. By calculating the mean of a country's scores between 1965 and 2010, it is possible to evaluate its mean performance for the last 46 years without relying solely on one survey that might overestimate or underestimate pupils' actual achievement level. However, it should be noted that available data change from country to country, and for some countries, we only have one single score. The database contains information on primary education in 103 countries/areas and on secondary education in 111 countries/areas (see Table 2 for this database).\nFigures 1 and 2 present the measured evolution of the quality of learning achievements among regions. Asian countries seem to outperform countries from other regions in the primary level. Especially, Korea, Kazakhstan, Chinese Tapei and Singapore are ranked as the top performing countries/areas, followed by Finland, Russian Federation and Hong Kong, China. It should be noted that pupils in Kazakhstan, the Russian Federation, Lithuania and Latvia have demonstrated high levels of achievement. It may thus be concluded that, among the middle-income countries, those in Eastern Europe and Central Asia perform the best. This could be linked with the communist past of those countries. Such regimes tended to heavily weight the investments in human capital (as other investment in public goods). Other regions perform less than developed economies and Asian countries. A strong variability in performance can be observed in Arab states, where the top performing country/area is Dubai, while the least performing country is Mauritania. In contrast, Cuba performs very well in primary education. Cuba's performance is higher than a lot of developed economies, such as Spain or Israel. Most sub-Saharan countries have a low performing level in primary education, but the scores vary greatly, from 180 points (for Niger) to 330 points (for Cameroun). It should be noted that we based our analysis on the results of the global performance of a country regardless of its composition. Therefore, if a country tends to attract most able students around the world, it will have a high performance in our methodology. This is exactly the same 'bias' that occurs for university rankings. For instance, PISA 2009 results showed that approximately 15% of pupils from Singapore have an immigrant background, while this proportion is more than 40% in Qatar. Therefore, it could be possible that immigrant students from Singapore may increase the mean score of Singapore. However, there is no significant difference in performance between students with and without an immigrant background in Singapore based on the PISA 2009 study (OECD, 2010, p. 69) . Moreover, a 1222 N. Altinok et al.\nrecent OECD study (OECD, 2013a) showed that in Qatar, Dubai, Macao-China and Singapore, recent immigrants tend to perform better than older immigrants. Analysis of the countries' performance in secondary education shows slight modifications compared with the primary education ranking (see Fig. 2 ). The developed economies in Asia perform better, whereas those in Eastern Mediterranean Europe -Cyprus and Greecescore the lowest. Results from Shanghai, China, demonstrate the high ability of a part of Chinese people to A new international database on education quality 1223 perform well in secondary schools. The performance levels of developing countries in terms of learning achievement are again highest in Eastern Europe. The top four countries are all in this region, namely Estonia, Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovenia. This tends to confirm our assumption concerning the policy preferences inherited from a communist past. Conversely, most countries with the lowest scores for secondary education are in Africa (Ghana, Botswana and South Africa). Moreover, India's very low score should be put in perspective, given that the country has not taken part in international surveys since 1970. Only two Indian states took part in PISA 2010 (Tamil Nadu and Himachal Pradesh). The adjusted results for these states are quite similar to the sub-Saharan African countries.\nBesides the mean scores for the whole population within each country, our database provides additional data for each gender (female and male) and each type of geographical location (urban and rural). A summary of these distinctions can be found in Figs 3-6. Figures 3 and 4 present the differences in schooling performance between females and males in primary and secondary education. Countries that are above the line are the ones where females tend to outperform males. In all Arab states where data are available, males tend to perform better than females. The difference between each gender is quite important in sub-Saharan African countries, but significant differences occur within the region. In developed countries, the difference of performance between males and females is quite lower compared with the developing countries. These results tend to confirm recent findings on gender gap research on educational attainment. Despite the benefits of female education in developing countries, there are large gender differences in educational attainment in favour of males, especially at the secondary and tertiary levels (OECD, 2011) . There is also persistent gender gap in primary education in the Middle East and North Africa, South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa (World Bank, 1999) . This is in contrast to most industrialized countries where females have higher educational attainment than males (Pekkarinen, 2012) . As the income levels rise across countries, the gender gap against females shifts from lower level of education to higher level and eventually the gap reverses (World Bank, 2012) . This hypothesis is confirmed in some Arab countries such as Algeria or Morocco: while we observed an advantage for male students in primary education, it shifts towards female students in secondary education.\nFigures 5 and 6 present the difference of performance between urban and rural areas inside each country/economy. In most countries, pupils from urban areas tend to perform better than pupils from rural areas. This is especially the case for sub-Saharan African countries such as Comoros and Togo, where the difference is higher than 60 points between the two groups. In developed economies, the difference is the highest in Portugal and Israel, whereas in a small number of countries, rural areas tend to perform better (England and Germany), but the difference is much smaller (less than 35 points). In secondary education, pupils in rural areas from Belgium and England have a better performance compared with pupils in urban areas. However, in most countries, pupils from urban areas perform better than pupils from rural areas. Some recent research showed that among OECD countries, a performance gap between urban and rural schools can be observed in 19 countries and is widest in Mexico and Portugal (which confirms our findings). In general, students who attend schools in urban settings come from more advantaged socioeconomic backgrounds. However, this is not the case of students from Germany or the United Kingdom (based on the PISA 2009 results). In particular, it appeared that in the United Kingdom, urban areas differed from rural areas regards the student-teacher ratio (Heath and Kilpi-Jakonen, 2012) . More teachers are allocated in rural areas compared with urban areas. Therefore, one possible explanation for the difference of performance of pupils from rural areas can be attributed to the differential student-teacher ratio. Concerning Germany, one possible factor is material educational resources, which are more present in rural than urban schools (OECD, 2013b) . Another important result is the lack of difference about socioeconomic background of pupils between urban and rural areas in these two countries, whereas this is the case in most OECD countries. More research explaining these differences is needed. Below, we discuss the longterm trends on quality of student achievement."}, {"section_title": "Long-term trends (1965-2010)", "text": "It appears crucial to deeply analyse the global trends in IQSA. As has been highlighted in the introduction, comparable data relative to schooling quality are very difficult to obtain. When we analyse the nature of the currently available data on schooling (such as the Barro and Lee database released in 2010), we must recognize that shortcomings are numerous, especially concerning the quality dimension (even if one has to recognize in parallel the pioneering role of this paper). It seems, therefore, important to obtain alternative indicators that partially take into account the qualitative dimension of education.\nOn top of that, we propose to analyse the global trends in schooling quality by creating new scores computed by combining mathematics and science scores for secondary education. 13 To our knowledge, this is the first study that 13 This panel data are only possible by combining science and mathematics subjects. This is the reason why we do not present separate trends for each subject.\n1224 N. Altinok et al.\naims to analyse and compare the trends in schooling quality. 14 The importance of stressing mathematics and science results is quite usual in economic literature as it has been shown that such performance greatly affects 14 Although Hanushek and Woessmann (2012) try to make similar analysis, their study is only graphical and very few information is available regarding to the amplitude of trends in schooling quality.\ngrowth and competitiveness potential of nations (Hanushek and Kimko, 2000) . We first detect a global convergence movement between countries in terms of schooling quality since the 1980s. For instance, whereas Hungary was ranked higher 15 On the issue of convergence between East and West Europe since the 1970s in educational terms, see Demeulemeester and Rochat (1997) ."}, {"section_title": "1228", "text": "N. Altinok et al.\nSecond, Fig. 7 presents the long-term trends on schooling quality for selected countries. For most countries, a significant growth in schooling quality is present (for instance, Chile, Hong Kong and Luxembourg); a global decline of schooling quality can be observed in countries Short-term trends (1995) (1996) (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) Due to the scarcity of data for the long run, we propose to undertake a similar level and convergence analysis for the short run. We follow the same methodology as in the long-run analysis. We, however, use more recent achievement tests (between 1995 and 2010). Our database includes trends on student achievement from 1995 to 2010 for 105 countries/ areas, whereas absolute scores for 150 countries/areas are provided. It may be interesting to compare the variation of schooling quality since 1995 and identify which countries have improved their level of quality (i.e. level of pupils' achievements). Table 5 presents extensive results for the short-term trends in schooling quality. We compile all variations in order to check for robustness of trends in schooling quality for countries that participate in several tests. However, it should be borne in mind that the period between two participations for a country is not always equivalent to other countries. For instance, the United States took part in 1995, 1999, 2003 and 2007 Here, the interval is shorter compared with the 1995-2007 period for the United States. In order to control these differences, we computed the average annual growth rate (AAGR) of schooling quality. While periods differ between countries and achievements tests, it is then possible to compare trends in schooling quality. When we have several cases to compare trends for the same country, we compute a mean of the AAGR. First, we distinguish between the primary and the secondary education (columns 1-4 in Table 5 ). Then, we aggregate the two levels in order to check for the global variation (column 'Primary + secondary'). For instance, 32 possible comparisons over time are available for Latvia. If we compute the mean of all 32 AAGR, we obtain an AAGR equal to 0.54% with a SE of 0.11.\nIn order to classify short-term trends, we adopt the following classification. We define two criteria: the first one is the absolute amplitude of the AAGR. If it is higher than 0.5, then we define it as high change (++ or --) . If the effect is between 0.2 and 0.5, the amplitude of the effect is intermediate (+ or -) . However, in order to correct for measurement error, we add a second condition to the intensity level of the growth: when the mean AAGR is at least two times higher than its SE, the effect can be considered as significant. For instance, for Qatar, while the mean is equal to 4.6, its SE is only equal to 0.94, which is more than four times lower. Indeed, we can say that the effect is trustable (although we have only three observations). Hence, regardless of the AAGR, when the ratio of AAGR/SE is lower than 2, we preferred not to accept a clear trend towards an increase or a decrease ('o'). Data on short-term trends are available for 105 countries/areas. A total of 1404 different variations have been calculated in order to obtain these trends. Hence, there are approximately 13 different series for each country. For developed countries/areas, such as Hong Kong, China, Hungary, there are 42 series of variations, which can allow us to increase the probability to conclude for an increase or a decrease in the quality of schooling. There is a significant increase in schooling quality for 26 countries/areas, while we observe no significant evolution for 60 countries/areas and a significant decrease for 19 countries/areas. Countries where the mean AAGR of quality of schooling is the highest are mainly countries/areas with a low level of educational quality. A strong increase is observed in Qatar (mean AAGR = +4.60%), Syrian Arab Republic (+2.52%) and Kyrgyzstan (+2.08%). The evolution is higher than +0.5% for 17 countries/areas, including only two developed countries (Luxembourg and Portugal). On the contrary, a significant decrease in schooling quality is present for 19 countries/areas. The decrease is higher than -0.5% for 11 countries/areas. All these countries are developing countries, except the United Kingdom and Canada (Quebec). Despite an initial low level, schooling quality tends to decrease in some subSaharan African countries, such as Cameroon, Burkina Faso and Madagascar.\nThe comparison of quality of education (measured from student achievement scores) between primary and secondary levels tends to show a high correlation: when we observe an increase in the primary education quality, trends in secondary level show an increase in quality too. While the primary education quality is increasing in countries such as Slovenia, Hong Kong, China, or Singapore, the quality of secondary schools tends to remain stable. It is quite interesting to note that when primary education quality declines, the quality of secondary schools shows a significant decline too. The only country where the variation of performance is opposed between primary and secondary education is Morocco. Indeed, a high decrease in performance is observed in primary schools (-0.91%) while secondary schools tend to improve their quality (+2.18%).\nMoreover, in Figs. 8 and 9, we compare the initial level of IQSA in each education level with its average growth rate during the period 1995 to 2010. The main idea is to test to what extent a convergence is present regarding the schooling quality. Results for primary education do clearly reject any convergence between countries. Indeed, while some countries had higher education quality in 1995, their growth rate is higher than other countries with initial low education quality (for instance, Singapore versus C\u00f4te d'Ivoire). In secondary education, results tend to indicate some convergence between countries. For instance, while Luxembourg performed less than Japan in 1995, its performance increased during the period 1995 to 2010, in contrast to the case of Japan, where the performance slightly decreased in secondary education. However, this convergence hypothesis should not hide that some countries with initial low performance tend to decrease their performance over time (as in the case of Iran). Hence, it "}, {"section_title": "IV. Comparisons with Alternative Measures of Human Capital Stock", "text": "In this section, we compare our indicators of student achievement with alternative measures of quality used in the literature and traditional measures of education. In our article, we build indexes of schooling quality on the basis of the international and regional standardized measures of pupils' achievements (i.e. cognitive skills)."}, {"section_title": "Alternative measures of schooling quality", "text": "Three major research papers propose an alternative measure of human capital, schooling or pupils' achievement quality. 16 First, Hanushek and Kimko (2000) , concerned with finding a better measurement of human capital quality of the workforce, measured it using scores obtained from students participating in international assessments in science and mathematics. Starting from these test scores, they constructed a unique (normalized) labour force quality measure for 31 countries covering the period from 1960 to 1990. They computed a quality measure for each country's labour force using the weighted average over all harmonized test scores, where each country's weight is calculated as the normalized inverse of its SE. They then performed a single cross-country regression for the 31 countries over the period. The authors used the surveys of the IEA and IEAP. In total, 26 series of educational performances were taken into account (by distinguishing according to age, the field of competence, namely mathematics and sciences, and year). They ended up with two series that were available. The first series sets the world mean on each of the tests used equal to 50. The second series adjusts all scores based on the US international performance modified for the national time pattern of scores on the NAEP (see Appendix B for a detailed explanation of this methodology).\nAnother contribution that directly includes the measurement of the quality of education in a model of growth is the one by Barro (2001) . The data used come from the same sources as those of Hanushek and Kimko (2000) . Barro, however, builds different aggregate indicators of cognitive skills than Hanushek and Kimko (2000) , including mathematics, sciences and reading tests results. Because of the restricted number of countries for which qualitative indicators of education are available, his sample is small and involves only 43 countries. Moreover, the methodology used by Barro (2001) does not take into account the possible differences in test variances across assessments. Finally, Barro (2001) calculated the average scores without any adjustment between achievement tests.\nRecently, Hanushek and Woessmann (2012) extended measures from Hanushek and Kimko (2000) . They added new international tests, more countries and changed the methodology in order to make available the possibility of 16 Other papers deal with this topic; however, databases provided suffer from either lack of enough data or huge methodological issues. See, for instance, Lee and Lee (1995) , Ciccone and Papaioannou (2005) and Coulombe and Tremblay (2006) . tracking evolution in cognitive skills. (2000) is high (R 2 = 0.52; 77 observations). We include imputed data from Hanushek and Kimko (2000) in this correlation. The comparison with the recent database of Hanushek and Woessmann (2012) is higher than the correlation with Hanushek and Kimko (2000) while it includes approximately the same number of countries (R 2 = 0.89; 75 observations). However, as our database is larger than other databases, some countries are not included in this comparison. Figure 4 shows the correlation between our database and the database of Hanushek and Woessmann (2012) . Even if a clear correlation appears, we tend to observe some significant differences, particularly for countries having a lower score of schooling quality. This is due to the fact that we take into account more assessments than Hanushek and Woessmann (2012) , especially LLECE, PASEC and SACMEQ. Information used by Hanushek and Woessmann (2012) for countries such as Jordan or Swaziland is not recent and is only based on one single score of achievement tests in 1980s. On the contrary, our database includes new scores for these countries (except for India 17 ) based on regional achievement tests. Since the ranking of countries differs between regional and international achievement tests, the performance of some countries such as South Africa tends to be overestimated in Hanushek and Woessmann's (2012) data set compared with our data set. The opposite effect can also be showed for countries such as Peru, where participation in LLECE tends to increase its performance."}, {"section_title": "Data on educational attainment", "text": "Three major databases are available for educational attainment. The first database is from Barro and Lee (2010, 2012) , which is an update of a previous paper (Barro and Lee, 2000) . Their paper presents a data set on educational attainment for the population over age 15 and 25 at 5-year intervals between 1950 and 2010 for a broad number of countries. The data set comprises at least one observation for 146 economies, of which 109 have complete information at 5-year intervals from 1960 to 2000. We obtain measures of average years of schooling for all levels in every country. The main source for such data is the UNESCO database on educational attainment and UNDP Human Development Office. When censuses or surveys were not available, Barro and Lee (2012) estimated the educational attainment using enrolment rates. Cohen and Soto (2007) have proposed a new set of data on human capital. It is originally based upon the data released by the OECD for a subgroup of 38 member and non member countries. Cohen and Soto (2007) expanded this data set to other developing countries. The key of their methodology is to minimize extrapolations and keep the data as close as possible to those directly available from national censuses (in the spirit of the work of De la Domenech (2002, 2006) for OECD countries 18 ). The data set consists of 95 countries and has been computed for the beginning of each decade from 1960 to 2000, plus a projection for 2010. This projection is based upon population projections by age taken from the U.S. Census Bureau website and the estimated educational attainment for the year 2000.\nThe World Population Program of the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) in Laxenburg, Austria, and the Vienna Institute for Demography, Austrian Academy of Sciences developed the IIASA/VID educational attainment model for reconstruction of educational attainment distributions by age and sex from 1970 to 2000 and projections to 2050. This database can be downloaded from the website of Edstats. 19 We used data from 1970 to 2005 by combining two models proposed by the IIASA/VID: the reconstruction model and model of projections. Projections have been carried out for 120 countries. More information concerning this database can be obtained in Lutz et al. (2007) and Kumar et al. (2010) (see Figs 10 and 11) .\nThe correlation between our adjusted students' test scores and data on schooling quantity is not very high. The correlation of our indicators (=IQSA) with the average net enrolment ratio (=NER) between 1960 and 2010 in secondary level, for high-income countries, is null and includes 38 observations. While some countries have approximately the same NER in secondary education, the IQSA tends to be different (Fig. 12) . This is, for instance, the case of Hungary and Greece: the former has a higher level of schooling quality, while the NER in 1995 is equal in these countries. A comparison with 17 As India only took part in one assessment in 1970, we preferred not to include this country in our data set. 18 We do not test the correlation between our data and the database proposed by De la Fuente and Dom\u00e9nech since the database of Cohen and Soto (2007) is quite similar and include more countries. 19 Database can be downloaded at http://go.worldbank.org/47P3PLE940 1236 N. Altinok et al.\nthe database of Barro and Lee (2010) shows a positive and quite high significant correlation of 0.62 (116 observations). However, this correlation is mainly due to a 'structural' effect, indicating that the higher a country is developed, the higher is its schooling quality. When we restrict this comparison to high-income countries, the correlation shrinks to 0.01 (38 observations, see Fig.  13 ). As the new data set of Cohen and Soto (2007) appears to be more precise than the one of Barro and Lee (2010) , we test to see to what extent years of schooling are correlated with our data. When we include all countries, the correlation is very high (R 2 = 0.74; 82 observations). However, for the high-income countries group, the correlation decreases to 0.15 (27 observations). We found similar results when we compare our data with the IIASA/VID database. The correlation decreases from 0.62 to 0.09 when we restrict our analysis to high-income countries (37 observations against 104 for the full sample). Hence, the absence of strong correlation between the basic quantitative indicator of education and our data on schooling quality (pupils' achievements) tends to prove the importance of taking into account the qualitative dimension of education and by the way of human capital."}, {"section_title": "V. Conclusion", "text": "It is now common practice to measure the performance of education systems. The findings from international surveys of learning achievement are increasingly being used to measure the quality of education. Yet they provide a solid foundation with which to do so.\nThe purpose of this article was to build a new index for the measurement of learning achievement by grouping together all existing international and regional learning assessments. Where other research has focused solely on one survey, this article has sought to group them together and thus obtain a more comprehensive range of data on pupils' performance. The methodology used is based largely on countries' participation in several surveys simultaneously, thus permitting the computation of intersurvey equivalence indices. Comparable indicators on learning achievement can thus be devised on the basis of a variety of surveys. We provide comparable indicators for student achievement for a broad number of countries both for intertemporal data and also for cross-country analysis. The cross-country data set includes IQSA for 103 countries/areas in primary education and 111 countries/areas in secondary education. Besides the general population within each country/areas, we also provide data for each gender (female or male) and each type of location (urban or rural). Moreover, following the initial idea of Hanushek and Woessmann (2012) , we computed proportion of pupils reaching a low level of competency (i. e. 1 SD below the international average -400 points) and the high level of competency (i.e. 1 SD above the international average -600 points). Following the same methodology used for mean scores, it permits us to obtain similar comparable proportions both in panel data and in crosssectional data."}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgements", "text": "We are most grateful to Geeta Kingdon and Jean Bourdon and two anonymous referees for their helpful comments.

International learning assessments", "text": "The IEA was the first body to measure individual learning achievements and conduct recurrent surveys for international comparative purposes as early as the 1960s. The surveys include the highly regarded TIMSS and PIRLS.\nA. TIMSS. The major survey series from IEA is the TIMSS. The central goal of TIMSS is to assess pupils' performance in both subjects and to describe the environment in which they acquired these skills. With this second objective in view, those who launched TIMSS firmly took a policy-oriented approach since pupils' scores were correlated with the various factors involved in teaching and affecting them. Five TIMSS rounds have been held to date. The first, conducted in 1995, covered 45 national educational systems and three groups of learners. 20 The second round covered 38 educational systems in 1999, examining pupils from secondary education (grade 8). The third round covered 50 educational systems in 2003, focusing on both primary and secondary education (grades 4 and 8). In 2007, the fourth survey covered grades 4 and 8 and more than 66 educational systems. The last round was performed in 2011 and covered 77 countries/ areas. 21 The precise content of the questionnaires can vary quite a lot but remains systematic across countries. Each topic is given a specific weight (e.g. numbers, algebra and geometry in mathematics subject and life sciences, physical sciences and the history of science in science subject). This article has drawn on virtually all IEA studies in the three skills (mathematics, sciences and reading/literacy). Data for have been taken from major publications dealing with IEA studies and the scores for other years are taken from official reports (Harmon et al., 1997; Martin et al., 2000 Martin et al., , 2004 Mullis et al., 2000 Mullis et al., , 2003 Mullis et al., , 2004 Mullis et al., , 2007 Mullis et al., , 2009 ).\nC. PISA. The OECD is another international organization that has carried out standardized international comparisons of pupils' achievements. The OECD launched its PISA in 1997 to meet the need for readily comparable data on student performance. The basic principles underlying PISA studies are the use of an extended concept of 'literacy' and an emphasis on lifelong learning. Literacy is considered more largely because PISA studies are concerned with the pupils' capacity to extrapolate from what they have learnt and apply their knowledge to new settings. More generally, PISA has assessed the skills of 15-year-old pupils every three years since 2000. PISA concentrates on three key areas, namely mathematics, science and literacy. In all PISA cycles, the domains of reading, mathematical and science skills are assessed. The main focus of PISA 2000 was on reading literacy, in the sense that it included an extensive set of tasks in this domain. In PISA 2003, the emphasis was on mathematical skills and in 2006 the focus was on scientific skills. The framework of evaluation remains the same across time so that one cycle's findings can be compared with those of the others. 23 In 2009, 72 countries/areas participated, while 64 countries/areas expect to take part in PISA 2012. Unlike the IEA surveys, PISA assesses only 15-year-old pupils, whatever their school level, whereas the grade is the main criterion in selecting pupils for IEA assessments (and over all student achievement tests)."}, {"section_title": "A.2. Regional learning assessments", "text": "Three major regional assessments have been conducted in Africa and Latin America. 20 IEA assessments defined populations relative to specific grades, while assessments as PISA focus on age of pupils. In IEA studies, three different group of pupils are generally assessed: pupils from grade 4, grade 8 and from the last grade of secondary education. Some Canadian provinces or states in the United States have occasionally taken part in the IEA surveys. For the sake of simplicity, these regions are not included in the number of countries participating in the surveys. 21 Since the microdata are not yet released, we did not include the TIMSS 2011 data set in our database. However, the database will be updated regularly with new released data. 22 Similar to TIMSS, pupils from grade 4 were chosen. D. SACMEQ. The SACMEQ grew out of a very extensive national investigation into the quality of primary education in Zimbabwe in 1991, supported by the UNESCO International Institute for Educational Planning (IIEP) (Ross and Postlethwaite, 1991) . Keen to follow up this successful initiative, several education ministers in southern and Eastern African countries expressed an interest in the study and wished to take part in such an assessment. Planners from seven countries therefore met in Paris in July 2004 and established SACMEQ as a special group. The 15 SACMEQ member education ministries are those of Botswana, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Seychelles, South Africa, Swaziland, United Republic of Tanzania, United Republic of Tanzania (Zanzibar), Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.\nThe first SACMEQ round took place between 1995 and 1999. SACMEQ I covered seven different countries and assessed performance in reading at grade 6. The participating countries were Kenya, Malawi, Mauritius, Namibia, United Republic of Tanzania (Zanzibar), Zambia and Zimbabwe. The studies, although mainly national in scope, had an international dimension and shared many common features (research issues, instruments, target populations, sampling and analytical procedures). A separate report was prepared for each country. In the second round, which was held between 2000 and 2002 and covered 14 countries and one territory (Zanzibar), performance in mathematics and reading was assessed. The target cohort consisted of grade 6 pupils, as under SACMEQ I. The participating countries were Botswana, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Seychelles, South Africa, Swaziland, United Republic of Tanzania, United Republic of Tanzania (Zanzibar), Uganda and Zambia.\nSeveral SACMEQ II items were replicated from the TIMSS survey to secure comparable results. The questionnaires were used to collect information on educational inputs, the educational environment and issues relating to the fair allocation of human and material resources. Information about the socioeconomic context was gleaned from the pupils' questionnaires. More generally, SACMEQ II included items selected from four previous surveys, namely the Indicators of the Quality of Education (Zimbabwe) study, SACMEQ I, TIMSS and the 1985-94 IEA Reading Literacy Study.\nThe third SACMEQ round (SACMEQ III) covers the same countries as in 2002 (plus Zimbabwe) and focuses on achievements levels of grade 6 pupils. Unfortunately, the micro database for SACMEQ III has not yet been released by the SACMEQ consortium. We will use the macro results of SACMEQ III in our study (SACMEQ, 2010) besides the microdata from SACMEQ II.\nE. PASEC. Surveys under the PASEC of the CONFEMEN have been conducted in the French-speaking countries of sub-Saharan Africa. This assessment contains results for primary school performance in mathematics and in French. In both CP2 (the second grade in primary school) and CM1 (grade 5), between 2000 and 2500 young learners in about 100 schools, along with their teachers and school heads, were surveyed in each of the evaluated countries. Some countries have taken part in the PASEC survey on several occasions. The following is a list of participating countries in chronological order: Djibouti (1994 ), Congo (1994 ), Mali (1995 ), Central African Republic (1995 ), Senegal (1996 ), Burkina Faso (1996 ), Cameroon (1996 ), C\u00f4te d'Ivoire (1996 ), Madagascar (1997 ), Guinea (2000 , Togo (2001) In order to simplify the analysis, we will consider two different rounds of PASEC: the first round includes assessments carried out between 1996 and 2003, whereas the PASEC II takes into account evaluations that have been done between 2004 and 2010. The next round of PASEC, namely the PASEC III study, is currently under preparation by the CONFEMEN. Moreover, as scores are not directly and fully comparable between each assessment, an anchoring of major items has been made in order to allow for international comparability. .\nAssessments conducted by the LLECE focused, therefore, on learning achievement in reading and mathematics in grades 3 and 4 in 13 countries in the region (Casassus Step 2: Adjustment of survey series A.1\nThe methodology used in survey series A.1 involved recurrent adjustment to the US NAEP survey in the way described by Hanushek and Kimko (2000) . The NAEP has been the main instrument used to measure the learning achievement of pupils in the United States since 1969. In order to obtain comparable ISATs, we need information on test performance that is comparable over time. Such information is available in NAEP. At various times since 1970, pupils aged 9, 13 and 17 in the United States have been tested on their achievement in science, mathematics and reading. To our knowledge, this is the only information on educational performance that is consistently available for comparisons over time. Moreover, the United States is the only country that participated in every ISAT. Based on the Hanushek and Kimko (2000) methodology, we can scale the level of each ISAT relative to the comparable test performance of the United States by using the time series evidence on the performance of US students. More specifically, the procedure involves tracking the level of 'difficulty' of a survey in accordance with the successive scores recorded in the United States.\nThe example below shows how achievement scores in mathematics under TIMSS 1995, in which the United States took part, can be anchored to the NAEP score (Table 1 ). The United States tested its own pupils under the NAEP mathematics survey. The score of the United States was 548 points under NAEP but 492 points under TIMSS. This differential can be used to adjust the TIMSS survey to the NAEP benchmark. Table B1 shows the scores of five countries under TIMSS and the calculation used to adjust them to the benchmark.\nAnother example is PISA 2000 in which the United States also took part (see Table B2 ). The idea is similar and aims at determining the difference between the score of the United States under PISA and NAEP, respectively. As PISA 2000 seems to underestimate the level measured by the NAEP, the PISA 2000 results have been increased by an adjustment coefficient of 518/505 = 1.03.\nThe same methodology has been applied to all assessments in which the United States took part and for which this is not possible to directly compare trends over time. matics. This is the reason why the anchoring process for mathematics and science is based on results from both PISA and TIMSS assessments. By comparing countries that took part in these assessments, our methodology avoids the problem of potential difference of performance between assessments (this methodology take the same approach of the one presented in step 4).\nStep 3: Adjustment of survey series A.2\nIf recent assessments such as PISA 2009 or PIRLS 2006 were to be adjusted according to the above procedure, all survey scores would be based on scores obtained in the United States. However, recent surveys have been designed to allow analysis of country across time. Pupils are given test pieces of the same level of difficulty in survey series conducted over the years, which makes it possible to analyse trends in pupils' performance directly over time. Any adjustment of the series A.2 assessments to the NAEP survey may thus distort the analysis of country performance trends in comparison with official trends published in PISA or TIMSS Trends Reports. For example, if the US score increases in the NAEP survey but decreases in another survey, such as PISA, the adjustment may lead to a fairly significant distortion. Yet the level of difficulty in pupils' performance assessments may vary significantly from one type of survey to another -for example, marking under TIMSS may be stricter than under PISA. Any adjustment should thus be such as to result in comparable scores under both types of survey.\nThe same adjustment coefficients as those calculated for the series A surveys are used in order to achieve a single linear conversion of country scores, and this procedure does not compromise the comparability of the scores obtained by countries participating in the same survey series.\nAs highlighted above, this main difference with the methodology used by Hanushek and Woessmann (2012) allows us to avoid a potential bias in estimating trends in pupils' performance for countries for which scores are already comparable over time. As our anchoring methodology is a simple linear transformation of surveys, the trends of schooling performance observed in PISA reports are still present in our database (see OECD, 2010) . 26 As shown in the section 'Alternative measures of schooling quality', our data set therefore shows some differences with the data set provided by Hanushek and Woessmann (2012) .\nMoreover, another difference with our previous publication concerns the information relative to trends between FIMS and SIMS and between FISS and SISS published in IEA Reports (see Keeves, 1992) . This additional information permitted us to simply adjust assessments on NAEP anchoring, but also to reproduce the trends found in these reports. Since a significant number of items were used in both assessments, the trends found in these reports may reduce the bias that occurs when we only use NAEP anchoring.\nStep 4: Adjustment of survey series B For the last group of surveys (called 'series C'), we cannot use a simple anchoring method on the NAEP since the United States did not participate in any regional assessment. We selected countries that participated in at least two different surveys so as to establish a comparison between the surveys. The IEA surveys have been chosen as reference surveys because they cover most of the countries and as the economic levels of the participating countries are the most heterogeneous.\nAs some countries took part simultaneously in several assessments, we can assume that the differences found between assessments are exogenous to the performance of these countries. For instance, if Colombia performed at a level of approximately 400 points in LLECE II assessment and obtained 321 points in TIMSS 2007 in mathematics, it is possible to suppose that independently of the performance of Colombia, the LLECE II study overestimated the performance of its participating countries by about 24% ([400/321-1] \u00d7 100) compared with the level of complexity in TIMSS 2007 assessment. Therefore, in order to adjust the LLECE II assessment to the TIMSS test, we need to correct this overestimation. This is the main methodology used in order to anchor each assessment with the IEA assessment (considered here as the reference assessments). First, we proceed with the adjustment of the LLECE II study to anchored IEA studies. Concerning mathematics, it is possible to anchor LLECE II assessment by adjusting its level with TIMSS 2007 assessment. We use the participation of Colombia and El Salvador in both tests in order to make this anchoring. The mean performance of these countries in LLECE II is equal to 491 points, while in TIMSS 2007, their performance declines to about 309 points. A linear transformation of LLECE II results in order to take into account this overestimation is then made. 27 The anchoring process for reading is based on the PIRLS 2001 study. As Argentina and Colombia took part in both LLECE II and PIRLS 2001 studies, the same methodology is used to anchor the LLECE II assessment in reading. 28 Concerning this anchoring, we use both grade 3 and grade 6 data in order to test for a specific 'grade effect'. As tested grades differ between PIRLS and LLECE II, we try to adjust independently both grades. We do not find a strong modification in countries' performance between grades 3 and 6. Indeed, there is no strong bias relating to the differences in grade level tested between assessments.\nThe next step consists of anchoring SACMEQ results with IEA assessments. For the anchoring process in reading, we use results from South Africa in both SACMEQ III and PIRLS 2006 database as this country took part in both assessments. By computing the anchoring coefficient between SACMEQ III and PIRLS 2006, and having in mind that the SACMEQ scores are comparable over time, it becomes possible to anchor all SACMEQ rounds with the PIRLS database. In mathematics, it is possible to indirectly adjust SACMEQ scores with countries that took part in the TIMSS 2007 assessment. In the SACMEQ database, already adjusted data with TIMSS are available. However, using these scores directly may overestimate the overall performance of SACMEQ countries due to the difference of grades tested between SACMEQ and TIMSS (grade 6 for SACMEQ and grade 4 for TIMSS). Hence, we also used as anchor country Botswana that participated in both TIMSS 2003 and SACMEQ II assessments as adjustment of the differences between grades. 29 As Botswana took part in both TIMSS 2003 and SACMEQ II studies, we adjust the difference of the two scores in order to rescale the SACMEQ database. After having taken into account the anchoring in the first step, the performance of Botswana declines from 512 points to 298 points (which represents a decline of about 40% of the original SACMEQ performance level). 30 The anchoring process with other SACMEQ assessments is not needed since the SACMEQ study provides comparable data between each round. Therefore, we use the same coefficient found in each skill with all SACMEQ rounds.\nThe last step concerns the anchoring of PASEC data. We base our methodology by anchoring the PASEC test with the adjusted SACMEQ test by comparing the results of Mauritius. As this country took part in both assessments (in 2006 for PASEC and 2007 for SACMEQ), we anchor PASEC assessment by adjusting the scores of countries that took part in PASEC with the difference of performance of Mauritius between PASEC and SACMEQ. As the PASEC scores are based on a scale between 0 and 100, the transformation of these scores in order to adjust them on the SACMEQ scale is equal to 5.97 in reading and 8.46 in mathematics. 31 This anchoring gives the same performance level for Mauritius in both PASEC and SACMEQ tests. As PASEC is an assessment for Francophone countries, while SACMEQ focuses on Anglophone countries, the anchoring process may lead to biases in adjusted reading scores. However, Mauritius has been tested in both languages in PASEC (English and French).\n32 By using both scores for Mauritius in PASEC, it gives us the adjusted coefficient of anchoring between PASEC and SACMEQ in reading. Similar to SACMEQ, since PASEC survey permits over time comparability after some adjustment, 33 we use the same coefficient of adjustment between the two rounds of PASEC for each skill.\nStep 5: Panel database\nThe main objective of our article is to build a cross-country and over time comparable data set for schooling performance. The adjustment made on previous steps allowed us to obtain comparable scores for each skill (mathematics, science and reading) and each level of education (primary and secondary). However, merging all this data without any adjustment may generate severe bias. Indeed, there may exist differences relative to assessments that may generate different scores for each country. For instance, while the performance of a country may be high in TIMSS, its performance can be lower in PISA in comparison to other countries. Our methodology consists of using all available information on performance for each country in order to obtain a panel data set between 1964 and 2010.\nMost assessments evaluate mathematics and science. Moreover, reading competence appears to be less correlated with science and mathematics. The main explanation refers to differences in languages spoken in each country, which may distort the evaluation of reading competence.\nOur adjustment is first based on countries that took part in FIMS, SIMS and TIMSS assessments. However, some countries took part in FISS and SISS without participating to FIMS and SIMS. In order to take into account their results in our data set, we predict the performance of these countries by regressing their scores in FISS on FIMS. Hence, the constant in the regression allows us to avoid a bias due to the potential difference between the two subjects. Moreover, we estimate the score of countries that took part in both FISS and SISS based on the variation of their performance instead of only the level. This methodology is better than to compute only predictions for scores in science every year because it allows us to better evaluate the trends in schooling performance over time. The data for trends between FIMS and SIMS come from while the data concerning FISS and SISS can be found in Keeves (1992) . For countries that took part in only one science assessment without any mathematics assessments, we restrict our adjustment to a simple prediction of scores on mathematics. The idea behind taking into account both in mathematics and science trends relies with the possibility of increasing the number of countries and the number of score points over time without altering the quality of the data. 29 This adjustment was made with a prediction of grade 4 pupils' results from grade 8 pupils' results for developing countries only based on TIMSS results. 30 It should be noted that the score of 298 points is the adjusted scores of Botswana in the TIMSS 2003 assessment and not its direct score. As we corrected all IEA studies with National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) anchoring, this mean performance has to be corrected too. It changes from 366 to 298 points in the case of Botswana. Therefore, this performance level becomes comparable with countries' performance in the TIMSS 2007 study and all other TIMSS data sets. 31 It would have been possible to begin by standardizing the PASEC database as other assessments, which would give another adjustment coefficient. However, we preferred to keep it intact before adjustment. As we use a linear translation, both methods would give the same results. 32 Since the results of Mauritius are overestimated at about 9% in French regarding to English language, we chose to change the coefficient of adjustment of both mathematics and reading with this coefficient. 33 We rescaled all PASEC data sets by anchoring with common items in each skill. For instance, concerning reading, we included only 24 items for the adjustment, whereas 33 items are present inside the test. For mathematics, 35 items were selected, among 37 items. Since the items are similar between the countries tested, the PASEC scores become comparable over time and between countries."}, {"section_title": "1246", "text": "N. Altinok et al.\nFor a very low number of countries, our adjustment uses the same methodology in two steps by using assessments in reading (PIRLS 2001 and PIRLS 2006) . Indeed, a number of countries took part in PIRLS assessment without a participation in TIMSS surveys. Similar to science adjustment, we first predict the scores for countries that took part in both PIRLS Concerning grade 4 assessments, the same adjustment was made. Since regional assessments are based on primary schooling evaluation, adjusted surveys were merged with IEA surveys (TIMSS and PIRLS). For a number of countries, we only have a participation in PIRLS without data for TIMSS. In order to take into account the potential difference of evaluation between reading and mathematics, we first predicted PIRLS The panel data set for primary and secondary education can be found in Excel spread sheet at the following link: http://www.beta-umr7522.fr/Datasets (Table 1) .\nStep 6: Cross-country data set It may be of interest to compare countries' average performance in international and regional surveys. First, countries' average score for all surveys at the same educational level is computed. Next, each country's average score in each skill and in all primary education surveys is calculated. The same procedure is carried out for secondary education and each skill.\nWe eventually obtain six different series of cross-country data for educational achievement since we distinguish for the level of education (primary versus secondary) and the skill evaluated (mathematics, science and reading). The mean score in each level is then computed by averaging scores from each skill.\nMoreover, we aggregated results from each education level in order to obtain a single general score of schooling performance for each country. Since the data set for each level is unbalanced, we first predicted the scores for all countries by using all the existing information (i. e. with general scores), and then we obtained the total scores for education (primary + secondary).\nThe data set can be found in the spreadsheet named 'Table 1' and in Appendix 2."}]
