[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "The impact of extreme storms on low-lying coastal areas produces different morphodynamic processes and responses, overwash being one of the most distinctive ones. Overwash can be defined as the flow of water (and sediment) over the crest of a beach that does not directly return to the water body where it originated (e.g. Donnelly et al., 2006). Although it is a common process, it is not usually considered in most of the existing coastal evolution models. This is because no robust method to quantify it exists and due to the scarcity of data sets to verify the models. In the last decades, thanks to the use of new technologies such as DGPS and Lidar, high-definition field datasets gathered just after storm impacts are becoming available and, their analysis is permitting to characterize the detailed morphological response to these events (e.g. Sallenger et al., 1999Sallenger et al., , 2001Stockdon et al., 2002). These analyses have permitted to propose conceptual models of barrier erosion during extreme events (e.g. Sallenger, 2000). Within this context, the main aim of this paper is to analyze field data of overwash transport and resulting morphological changes during extreme events to look for a parametric relationship to describe sediment transport as a function of relevant driving terms."}, {"section_title": "THE STORM", "text": "In this paper we analyze field data to characterize the response of a sandy barrier, Assateague Island (Figure 1), to the impact of two consecutive northeasters on January 29 and February 6, 1998. Barrier island topography before and after the impact of the two northeasters was obtained with an airborne scanning lidar, the NASA's Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM). Although the entire barrier experienced significant shoreline retreat (Stockdon et al., 2002), with important dune erosion and overwashing spots along much of the coast (Sallenger et al., 1999), here we focus in a 2 km long stretch on the island's southern end (Figure 1). According to the impact scale of Sallenger (2000), this stretch was subjected to the overwash regime. Morphological changes due to the storm impact were determined by comparing a pre-storm lidar flight in September 1997 and a post-storm lidar flight conducted in 9 and 10 February 1998. Although the time span between surveys is long, Sallenger et al. (1999) assumed that September 1997 was characteristic of pre-storm conditions since the most important storms in the area were the ones analyzed here (i.e. most of the extreme changes, especially in the backbarrier should be induced by the February 1998 storm). Barrier topography derived from Lidar data were used to define cross-shore profiles along the southern end of the barrier every 50 m. These pre-and poststorm profiles were referred to the NAVD88 and, only, the subaerial part of the data was used in this analysis. The driver of observed morphological changes was the impact of two consecutive northeasters in a period of 10 days (end of January-beginning of February 1998). Offshore significant wave heights recorded by the NOAA 44009 wave buoy off Ocean City exceeded 7 m at both storm peaks. However, nearshore wave heights were significantly lower, with maximum H m0 of about 4 m recorded by the CERC station MD002 (located at 9 m depth in Ocean city) at storm peaks ( Figure 2). Mean water level recorded by the NOAA tide gauge 8570283 is shown in Figure 2 where a double-peak surge is clearly identified.  To characterize the total water level at the shoreline, the induced wave runup, R 2% , was calculated by using the Stockdon et al. (2006) formula. The soestimated run-up was added to the mean water level and, for each barrier profile the instantaneous freeboard Ru-D was calculated as the difference between the total water level and the barrier height, D. In order to take into account the effective duration of the overwash conditions, a \"cumulative freeboard\" was defined during the storm event as (1) Figure 3 shows the morphological consequences of the storm in different sections of the southern end of the barrier. We can identify three main types of response as a function of the pre-storm profile. The first one verifies for profiles with its maximum height located at the front of the barrier (DF) and of low magnitude which are easily overwashed. The response type for these profiles is characterized by a massive sediment transport towards the backbarrier where most of the sediment eroded from the seaside shoreline is deposited (profiles type A in Figure 3). The final morphological consequences are: profile lowering (Figure 4), decrease of the beachface slope and landward barrier displacement (rollover) with a general trend of maintaining its width.  The second type verifies for profiles with its maximum height located landward than the front of the barrier (DF) or where an inner obstacle (elevation) exists. In this kind of profiles, although the frontal barrier elevation can be easily overwashed (depending on its height) the presence of an inner obstacle limits the contribution of the overwash to the backbarrier (profiles type B in Figure 3). The final morphological consequences are: decrease of the beachface slope and outer shoreline retreat with a general barrier narrowing trend. The third type verifies for high profiles for which no significant overwash is observed (profiles type C in Figure 3). The final morphological consequences are: profile lowering (Figure 4), decrease of the beachface slope and seaside shoreline retreat with a general narrowing trend. Finally, one of the general consequences of the storm impacts is the lowering of the barrier, especially for type A and C profiles (Figure 4). Moreover, one clearly defined morphological consequence is that the post-storm frontal elevation of the barrier is limited to a maximum value which will be limited by the magnitude of the total water level during the storm. For the analyzed case, this limiting value of the barrier frontal height is 2.4 m ( Figure  4).  "}, {"section_title": "OVERWASH SEDIMENT TRANSPORT", "text": "To estimate the sediment transport associated with the overwash event, barrier profile changes were divided into sediment eroded from the seaside part (Qer) and sediment deposited in the inner barrier (Qow) ( Figure 5). The sediment eroded from the outer coast -in the normal direction-can be potentially produced by two main contributions: seaward transport (undertow induced) and shoreward transport (overwash induced). On the other hand, the sediment deposited in the backbarrier will be mainly transported by overwash. Neglecting alongshore sediment transport induced changes, cross-sectional barrier changes can be considered as the product of the balance between undertow and overwash induced changes. Thus, the larger the overwash is, the lower the seaward transport will be because under significant wave overtopping, undertow weakens and, in consequence, barrier rollover becomes the dominant morphological process.  Figure 6 shows the values of the volume of sediment eroded in the outer barrier profile (Qer), the overwash sediment transported -that deposited in the backbarrier-(Qow), the cumulative freeboard (\u03c7) and the barrier height along the analyzed stretch. The last two parameters have been evaluated for the prestorm conditions.  The apparent relationship between overwash transport and the cumulative freeboard observed in Figure 6 is further analyzed in Figure 7. Thus, it can be seen that the larger the cumulative overwash is, the larger the fraction of the sediment volume eroded from the seaside barrier due to overwash will be. As the cumulative freeboard increases, Qow tends to the values of Qer and, there are few points where they are even larger ( Figure 6), probably due to some alongshore contributions. The obtained relationship is linear with a threshold value of the cumulative freeboard which define minimum conditions for overwash to be effective to transport sediment towards the backbarrier. Figure 7 also shows the absolute values of overwash sediment transport integrated over the storm duration. As expected, the relationship between Qow and the cumulative freeboard is similar to the previously described one, i.e. a linear relationship with a threshold value to be exceeded for effective overwash transport. It has to be noted that most of existing overwash transport models are usually based on the assumption that the transport is proportional to flow rate over the beach, which results in a non-linear relationship between sediment transport and freeboard (see e.g. Larson et al., 2004). However, analyzed data did not show any significant improvement when integrated transport and cumulative freeboard were non-linearly related and, due to this, here we present/adopt the simplest relationship. The driving term used to estimate the importance of the overwash transport to the backbarrier evolution as well as its magnitude is the cumulative freeboard. To calculate this parameter we have to select the barrier configuration to be overwashed. This has important consequences in terms of the uncertainty involved in the analysis due to two main contributions: (i) during the storm, the beach slope of the barrier seaside decreases in such a way that the final profile is milder than the pre-storm one, and (ii) the barrier height decreases during the overwash event in such a way that the barrier becomes lower than under pre-storm conditions. If we consider these two changes in the barrier configuration, the here defined cumulative freeboard should be affected (morphologically controlled) during the storm. Thus, the first contributor (slope decrease) should induce a reduction of the wave run-up whereas the second one (profile lowering) should tend to facilitate barrier overwash. The final cumulative consequences of these two factors will depend on their relative magnitudes. In order to get a first estimation of the expected variability on the cumulative freeboard during the storm duration, pre-storm and post-storm values were calculated for corresponding barrier configurations fed with the same wave conditions. Figure 8 shows the ratio between post-and pre-storm cumulative freeboard for all the analyzed profiles together the corresponding estimated integrated overwash transport. As it can be seen, there is not a common behavior for the analyzed event, in such a way that there are profiles that would experience a decrease in the cumulative freeboard if the barrier response is included (\u03c7 post / \u03c7 pre < 1) and profiles experiencing an opposite behavior (\u03c7 post / \u03c7 pre > 1). Assuming that the relationship between cumulative freeboard and overwash transport is unique, this should indicate a non-uniform response behaviour during the storm, with sections experiencing an increase in overwash transport rates as the storm progresses (those with values \u03c7 post / \u03c7 pre > 1) and sections with decreasing transport rates (those with values \u03c7 post / \u03c7 pre < 1)."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS", "text": "In this paper, barrier island morphodynamic response and associated sediment transport under a storm impact determining the system to be under overwash regime is presented. The used data obtained from Lidar flights was proven to be excellent for this kind of analysis. However, in some areas where significant overwash occurred, we found an insufficient overlapping between pre-storm and poststorm topographies in the backbarrier since lidar coverage's tend to follow actual shorelines. Thus, it is recommended that if lidar data are going to be used to estimate the barrier (low-lying coast) response to storms, they must also significantly cover the inner part since overwash is usually a dominant process (and not only the shoreline erosion). This would imply to make an estimation of the landward extent of overwash processes to define the area to be monitored. In this work we propose as main parameter to characterize driving terms controlling overwash, the here called cumulative freeboard. The main characteristic of this parameter is that takes into account the time that the barrier/beach is overwashed. This was also intrinsically done by Zhang et al. (2001) and Mendoza and Jim\u00e9nez (2006) among others by assuming that storm duration was a key parameter in estimating storm erosion potential. The main implication of this is that to predict the contribution of any storm to overwash sedimentation in backbarriers we need to know not only the freeboard during the storm (excess of total water level above the barrier crest) but also the duration of such conditions, i.e. it is not enough to know main variables at the peak of the storm but their time evolution (use of a time series to define a storm instead of a maximum value). Moreover, as barrier evolves during the storm action there will be a morphodynamic-induced source of uncertainty to describe/predict overwash processes. This uncertainty has been analyzed in this work by estimating the variation in the cumulative freeboard introduced by the use of pre-and poststorm morphologies. Results show that there is not a general trend in the evolution of governing conditions during the storm. Thus, some sections of the barrier experienced an increase in overwash transport rates due to the barrier evolution and other sections showed an opposite behavior. This uncertainty has to be taken into account when predicting the overwash transport due to the impact of a storm in a given barrier. Results show that the barrier response to the storm is basically controlled by the barrier frontal height and, if present, by any inner elevation that could intercept overwash transport. For the analyzed data (which were selected in a section of the barrier significantly overwashed), the final consequence is a lowering of the barrier and, the existence of a limit post-storm frontal height. Finally, it was found that the contribution of the overwash transport to the volume eroded from the outer coast as well as its magnitude (integrated over the storm duration) are linearly related to the cumulative freeboard. Thus, although theory predicts a non-linear relationship between sediment transport and Ru-D, the used data taken under overwash regime seems to indicate that to derive a parametric formula predicting the magnitude of overwash a linear relationship should be enough. However, this last conclusion has to be verified by adding more data sets."}]
