Data were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database.\nFour different PET scans processing pipelines from 2 different laboratories were compared. The PET cutoff values were established using a mixture-modeling approach, and different mathematical models were applied to define the association between CSF and PET amyloid measures.\nThe values of the CSF A\u03b21-42 samples and florbetapir-PET scans showed a nonlinear association (R 2 = 0.48-0.66), with the strongest association for values in the middle range.\nThe presence of a larger dynamic range of florbetapir-PET scan values in the higher range compared with the CSF A\u03b21-42 plateau explained the differences in correlation with cognition (R 2 = 0.36 and R 2 = 0.25, respectively). The APOE genotype significantly modified the association between both biomarkers. The PET cutoff values derived from an unsupervised classifier converged with previous PET cutoff values and the established CSF A\u03b21-42 cutoff levels. There was no association between longitudinal A\u03b21-42 levels and standardized uptake value ratios during follow-up.\nThe association between both biomarkers is limited to a middle range of values, is modified by the APOE genotype, and is absent for longitudinal changes; 4 different approaches in 2 different platforms converge on similar pathological A\u03b2 cutoff levels; and different pipelines to process PET scans showed correlated but not identical results.

Florbetapir was not available at the baseline ADNI 1 visit, and therefore some of these participants had their first florbetapir-PET scan performed during subsequent visits. The number of visits in which PET scans were performed were 739 at baseline, 23 at 24 months, 3 at 36 months, 25 at 48 months, 25 at 60 months, and 5 at 72 months. For the CSF A\u03b21-42 mixture model analysis, 1005 participants with a CSF A\u03b21-42 measurement were included (ie, all participants with at least 1 CSF A\u03b21-42 measurement to estimate the CSF A\u03b21-42 cutoff level).

A total of 501 participants had a second PET amyloid scan performed within 2 years, and a total of 150 participants also had CSF samples obtained within 30 days of the second PET scan.

An MARS creates piecewise regression models (hinges) for each variable in the model, and these models are separated by knots to capture changes in the association according to different ranges of the measures, using a data-driven approach. To test the models, the sample was divided into a training set and a test set, which included two-thirds and one-third of the participants, respectively. Each participant was only included once in this analysis. The different statistical models were developed in the training set using a 10-fold cross-validation and afterward applied to the test set. The coefficient of determination (R 2 ) is reported to summarize the goodness of fit of each model. Cutoffs for amyloid biomarkers were obtained using a previously reported strategy that uses finite mixture models (eTable 1 and eFigure 1 in the Supplement)."}, {"section_title": "28,29", "text": "Results"}, {"section_title": "Cross-sectional Association Between Individual CSF and Florbetapir-PET A\u03b2 Measures", "text": "The first and second columns in Figure 1 show the CSF and PET A\u03b2 levels for the participants included in the training and test sets, respectively, and the fitted models (the solid gray areas show disagreement in participant classification between both biomarkers). Coefficients of determination (R 2 ) for the different models are summarized in eTable 2 in the Supplement. In all comparisons, the linear model showed the worst performance in the training and test sets, whereas the hyperbolic and MARS models showed overall the best performance. APOE genotype influenced the relationship; an increasing number of \u03b54 copies were associated with lower CSF A\u03b21-42 levels for the same PET SUVR in all models. In all MARS models, the first hinge was located in a narrow range of A\u03b21-42 levels (225-288 pg/mL for participants with 0 copies of the APOE \u03b54 allele and 208-214 pg/mL for participants with 1 copy of the APOE \u03b54 allele), and the second hinge showed a slightly higher variability (137-144 pg/mL for participants with 0 copies of the APOE \u03b54 allele and 119-132 pg/mL for participants with 1 copy of the APOE \u03b54 allele). The PET SUVRs could not accurately predict CSF A\u03b21-42 levels before the first hinge (R 2 = 0.01-0.10) and after the second hinge (R 2 = 0.11-0.26).\nWe tested whether clinical diagnosis was a significant predictor, but it was not selected in any of the MARS models. Similar results that included 2 hinges in the MARS were obtained when CSF A\u03b21-42 level was selected as the predictor and the florbetapir measures were selected as outcomes (data not show). eTable 3 in the Supplement shows PET SUVRs that corresponded to the CSF A\u03b21-42 cutoff level of 192 pg/mL for participants with 0 copies or 1 copy of the APOE \u03b54 allele. Table 2 summarizes the \u03ba coefficients and overall percentage agreement for each pair of biomarkers. There was a substantial agreement between the CSF A\u03b21-42-defined groups and the groups that were defined based on the different florbetapir-derived measures (\u03ba = 0.69-0.76), but it was lower than the excellent agreement observed for the different florbetapir-PET measures (\u03ba = 0.80-0.91). Most of the participants who were classified differently by CSF and PET A\u03b2 measures presented with abnormal CSF A\u03b21-42 levels and normal PET SUVRs (8.9%-12.5%) compared with participants with normal CSF A\u03b21-42 levels and abnormal PET SUVRs (0.7%-4.5%). We compared clinical characteristics in the groups with mismatched biomarker results (eTables 4 and 5 in the Supplement). Although there were a larger number of participants who were cognitively impaired in the group that had only abnormal CSF A\u03b21-42 levels compared with the group that had only abnormal summary cerebellum values, the differences were not significant (P = .50). Whereas there were no differences in the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) scores between groups at the 12-month followup, the participants who had only abnormal CSF A\u03b21-42 levels showed memory decline, and the participants who had only abnormal summary cerebellum values showed executive decline.\nThe different PET SUVRs obtained with the different references and pipelines were highly correlated (eFigure 2 in the Supplement), with correlation coefficients between 0.81 and 0.95, although the values were not comparable and needed a transformation between pipelines (eTable 6 in the Supplement). When we tested the ability of florbetapir-PET measures and CSF A\u03b21-42 levels to predict the ADAS-cog score, the summary composite measure (R 2 = 0.36) outperformed the A\u03b21-42 level (R 2 = 0.25) in a cross-validated MARS model that included age as a covariate (Figure 2A and B). The MARS model fits calculated for each of the clinical diagnostic groups are summarized in eTable 7 in the Supplement. Results were similar for other PET A\u03b2 measures.\nLongitudinal CSF and PET A\u03b2 Measurements Figure 2C -F shows baseline SUVRs for each of the PET measurements (x-axis) and the corresponding yearly change (yaxis) for participants with 2 PET measurements, and Figure 2G shows the changes in the CSF A\u03b21-42 level for the same period. For 304 participants who had 2 PET scans and CSF samples obtained during the baseline visit, only the group with abnormal A\u03b21-42 levels and abnormal PET SUVR summary measures showed a greater increase during follow-up ( Figure 2H and I). A total of 150 participants (53 cognitively normal participants, 90 participants with mild cognitive impairment, and 7 participants with AD) had 2 CSF and PET A\u03b2 measurements obtained during the same visits, with the second set of measurements occurring within 2 years (ie, mean [SD], 729.7 [20.8] days) of the first. Figure 3 displays scatterplots with the yearly value changes during follow-up for the CSF A\u03b21-42 and florbetapir-PET measurements below the diagonal and their correlation above the diagonal (eFigure 3 in the Supplement also shows associations between the PET SUVRs). There was no correlation between CSF and PET amyloid value changes, while the different PET A\u03b2 amyloid measurements correlated with a higher degree. The correlation between CSF A\u03b21-42 level and florbetapir-PET measure did not improve when only participants with A\u03b21-42 levels between both MARS hinges (140-215 pg/mL) were included (data not shown)."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Cross-sectional CSF A\u03b21-42 levels and florbetapir-PET measures were associated for a limited middle range of values that included the cutoffs, and they were consistent with AD. The association was significantly modified by the number of APOE \u03b54 alleles. Nevertheless, there was a large agreement for the classification of participants as having an AD-like A\u03b2 burden between the different measures. Different approaches converged on a similar cutoff for pathological A\u03b2 deposition across platforms. However, there was no correlation between longitudinal changes observed after 2 years of follow-up. Previous studies 16, 19 have mainly analyzed the agreement between CSF and PET A\u03b2 measures in the same cohort using a single florbetapir-PET measure or using Pearson correlation or linear regressions assuming a linear association. 18 Good agreement between CSF A\u03b21-42 level and florbetapir-PET SUVR has been previously reported using a single pipeline for the latter. 16, 19 In the present study, we found an excellent correlation-classification agreement using 4 separate SUVRs obtained in 2 different laboratories using 2 distinct pipelines. Including different processing pipelines used in the 2 laboratories allowed us to analyze how the use of different pipelines and references can affect comparisons across studies. We showed that cross-sectional SUVRs were highly correlated and that different processing pipelines and choices of references led to a disagreement of 5% to 10%, and \u03ba coefficients between 0.80 and 0.91 in a large sample of participants processed in 4 different ways, which could be a potential important source of variability between studies. Thus, each pipeline needs to establish its own cutoffs. Recently, a new method has been proposed to compare values across different PET ligands and processing pipelines. 30 Nevertheless, CSF A\u03b21-42 levels and florbetapir-PET measures showed much higher agreement and much higher \u03ba coefficients than the ones observed when the different neuronal injury biomarkers were studied in the same cohort. 31 The validity of the cutoffs has been previously demonstrated in a 3-fold manner: (1) the CSF A\u03b21-42 level cutoff was initially demonstrated using autopsy-validated diagnoses 25 to prevent biases due to clinical diagnostic uncertainties, 5 (2) this cutoff was then validated using a \"diagnosis-free\"-driven mixture model analysis of CSF A\u03b21-42 levels, 28 and (3) for florbetapir-PET SUVRs, investigators used young controls 32 and autopsy cases. 2 In the mixture model analysis of summary CB values that we performed, 1.12 was designated as the cutoff that corresponds to an SUVR of 1.11 using the semiautomated quantification applied by Avid and, therefore, overlaps with their validated cutoff 32 (eFigure 4 in the Supplement). Furthermore, the 1.12 summary CB cutoff value is close to the average of the transformation of the CSF A\u03b21-42 autopsyvalidated cutoff level for participants with 0 or 1 APOE \u03b54 allele. In addition, using a mixture-modeling approach in a sample of 1005 levels of CSF A\u03b21-42, we reached the same level as the one previously described in our autopsy study. 25 Therefore, we confirmed the previous florbetapir-PET cutoff established based on young controls using an unsupervised classification method, in a sample that included a large number of cognitively normal participants, participants with mild cognitive impairment, and participants with AD, and the CSF A\u03b21-42 autopsy-validated cutoff level in a larger sample using the approach applied by De Meyer et al 28 in a larger sample. Most importantly, we demonstrated that the conversion of the values across different platforms and methods converges robustly on the similar burden of A\u03b2 pathology. However, we emphasize that recommended SUVR cutoffs vary according to the pipeline that was used, and therefore any modification in the pipeline must be followed by a validation of new cutoffs. Previous studies 16, 19 have described groups of participants that show disagreement in classification between CSF A\u03b21-42 levels and florbetapir-PET measures. The size of these groups varies depending on the reference region, and the disagreement decreases when white matter regions are used as a reference. This might be explained by the fact that the cerebellum is affected in latter stages of AD, 33 and therefore reference regions might be affected differently in later stages of disease. Recently, a lower cutoff level for CSF A\u03b21-42 (ie, 157 pg/ mL) and an average cerebellum with a cutoff SUVR of 1.26 that is skewed toward more abnormal values of pathological A\u03b2 biomarkers were suggested. 19 These values were obtained using clinical diagnosis as the gold standard and contradict evidence from previous autopsy-based studies using unsupervised diagnosis-independent methods. 25, 28, 32 This can be explained by our current understanding of the pathological A\u03b2 One previous study 9 pursued efforts to transform CSF A\u03b21-42 levels to Pittsburg Compound B-PET SUVRs, and vice versa, and used a log 2 transformation for both values owing to the lack of a linear association. However, the goal of our study was to transform the values between the different methods and to understand how both are related (in order to interpret differences in the timing of the biomarker changes for both biomarkers across the whole clinical spectrum) and the implications thereof. Based on the MARS models, it can be concluded that there is only a strong association between CSF and florbetapir-PET A\u03b2 values for the midrange values of both measures, which include the currently applied CSF A\u03b21-42 level measured using the multiplex xMAP Luminex platform 25 and the florbetapir-PET A\u03b2 amyloid measure normalized to cerebellum 2,32 cutoff values. It is also in this range where most of the discrepant classification appears. This could be due, in part, to the variability inherent to any clinical measure that can have an important effect for cases with values close to a dichotomic cutoff. Another explanation for this disagreement might be the lower affinity of PET amyloid ligands for diffuse plaques 2, 42 and the differential effect of the APOE genotype on biomarker values. Different amyloid PET ligands share their binding site and show a higher affinity for neuritic amyloid plaques compared with diffuse amyloid plaques, which can lead to false negatives. 3, [42] [43] [44] [45] While it is thought that the decrease in CSF A\u03b21-42 levels, but not in other A\u03b2 levels, 18 reflects brain A\u03b2 deposition, more mature forms might not be in equilibrium with CSF and, therefore, might lead to the plateau observed in the CSF A\u03b21-42 level, or later stages might represent A\u03b2 levels that are not in equilibrium with the CSF. Therefore, the wider range of CSF A\u03b21-42 levels in the lower range of florbetapir-PET SUVRs might imply a stronger association of the CSF A\u03b21-42 level with diffuse amyloid plaques, which appear in earlier phases without the presence of neuritic plaques."}, {"section_title": "46", "text": "Another explanation is that different sensitivities or ceiling effects of the assays could account for the strong association between CSF A\u03b21-42 levels and florbetapir-PET A\u03b2 measures only for the midrange values of these 2 most widely used measures of pathological A\u03b2 deposition. However, the CSF A\u03b21-42 level plateau is well above the lower detection limit of the Luminex assay. Furthermore, APOE \u03b54 is associated with a higher proportion of fibrillar amyloid and neurotic plaques, 47,48 which show a higher affinity for amyloid PET ligands and, therefore, would explain the higher SUVRs, and this would explain why the presence of APOE \u03b54 had different effects on both the CSF A\u03b21-42 levels and the florbetapir-PET measures across all pipelines. For the same CSF A\u03b21-42 levels, participants with no \u03b54 alleles had lower florbetapir-PET SUVRs. We performed several analyses to assess the clinical correlations of participants who showed either abnormal CSF A\u03b21-42 levels or abnormal florbetapir-PET measures and found differences in the cognitive changes, but a longer follow-up (including autopsies) will be needed to characterize these small groups of participants. Surprisingly, there was no correlation between the changes in CSF A\u03b21-42 levels and the changes in florbetapir-PET measures after a 2-year follow-up. There are several nonmutually exclusive explanations for this finding: (1) the changes are small and might not be detected owing to the inherent variability of the measurements, (2) a longer follow-up is needed to see larger changes, and (3) the different dynamic ranges of these 2 biomarkers could lead to different rates of changes in them across the biomarker spectrum. This might be due to the fact that these 2 biomarkers reflect different aspects of disease mechanisms, leading to A\u03b2 fibrillation and deposition, as well as different floor and ceiling effects as already noted. However, another factor that might explain these differences is the sensitivity of the measures of CSF A\u03b21-42 level and florbetapir-PET SUVR to track small changes during a 2-year follow-up. In any case, it is not surprising that the methods used to measure CSF A\u03b21-42 level and brain A\u03b2 amyloid deposits do, in fact, measure different aspects of pathological A\u03b2 amyloid as previously discussed.\nFlorbetapir-PET SUVRs showed a stronger association with ADAS-cog scores, which can be explained by the absence of the floor effect observed for CSF A\u03b21-42 levels, and thus can offer a larger dynamic range along disease progression. Nevertheless, the association with cognition is lower than the one observed for neuronal injury neuroimaging biomarkers. 49 "}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Thus, in conclusion, although CSF A\u03b21-42 levels and florbetapir-PET A\u03b2 measures show a high-classification agreement for dementia due to underlying AD pathology, these are clearly different measures of pathological A\u03b2 amyloidosis that converge to similar diagnostic cutoffs across different cohorts, methods, and amyloid biomarkers, but they do not closely correlate in the cross-sectional low and high range of values. Notably, this extends to a lack of correlation for the longitudinal changes in these 2 biomarkers during a 2-year follow-up. Hence, our novel findings are significant for understanding how to interpret CSF A\u03b21-42 levels and florbetapir-PET A\u03b2 measures for diagnosis and for understanding the mechanisms of A\u03b2 amyloidosis."}]
