[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The current pandemic of COVID-19, caused by a novel virus strain, SARS-CoV-2, has led to over 1,400,000 confirmed cases and 80,000 fatalities in over 100 countries since its emergence in late 2019.\nSARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA betacoronavirus of the family Coronaviridae. Humans coronaviruses cause respiratory tract infections that can be mild, such as some cases of the common cold, e.g. HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, HKU1. However, over the past two decades, highly pathogenic human coronaviruses have emerged, including SARS-CoV in 2002 and 2003, which infected 8,000 people worldwide and with a fatality rate of ~10% and MERS-CoV in 2012 with 2,500 confirmed cases and a death rate of 37% 1 . Infection with these highly pathogenic coronaviruses can result in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), which may lead to widespread inflammation in the lungs, shortness of breath, and death. Compared to MERS and SARS, SARS-CoV-2 appears to spread more efficiently although with relatively lower mortality of 2%~3% 1,2 . Furthermore, mounting evidence has suggested that the subclinical cases, which show limited to no symptoms but could spread virus as well, may represent a large amount of the infections 3, 4 .\nThe existence of the large pool of covert cases is a new threat to the control of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.\nThe SARS-CoV-2 entries cells by engaging the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as receptor with the surface unit (S1) of the spike (S) protein, and then uses the host serine protease TMPRSS2 for S priming, allowing fusion of viral and cellular membranes and viral entry into the cell 5 . Pneumonia is the common symptom of SARS-CoV-2 infection 6 ; however, there was also evidence of damages to the liver 7 and spleen 8 as well as gastrointestinal symptoms 9 . The SARS-CoV-2 infection causes increased secretion of cytokines, and the main death cause of SARS-CoV-2 is ARDS, for which one of the main mechanisms are the cytokine storm, the deadly uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response resulting from the release of large amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines by immune cells in SARS-CoV-2 infection 6 . Nevertheless, the mechanism of virus invasion, release and the causes of these exuberant inflammatory responses in SARS-CoV-2 infection remain largely unknown.\nmiRNA is a small non-coding RNA molecule with an average of 22 nucleotides in length. miRNA was widely found in plants, animals and some viruses and involved in a variety of biological processes. In most cases, miRNAs interact with the 3\u2032 untranslated region (3\u2032 UTR) of target mRNAs to induce mRNA degradation and translational repression. However, except for the role as a repressor, increasing evidence has shown that miRNAs could activate gene expression by interacting with other regions, including the 5\u2032 UTR and gene promoters 10, 11 . As crucial regulators of gene expression, miRNA-targeted therapeutics has been proposed or for treatment of cancers, virus infection and other diseases. For example, antimiR targeted at has-miR-122 is in trials for treating hepatitis 12 .\nIt has shown that viral genomes, including DNA and RNA virus, were capable of encoding miRNAs 13, 14 . The virus-derived miRNAs can be expressed in host cells and participate in the lifecycle and cellular consequences of infection. In 2004, Tuschl and colleagues identified the first viral miRNAs encoded by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a common human herpesvirus types in the herpes family. To date, over 300 viral encoded miRNAs have been described. A couple of EBV-encoded miRNAs were identified since 2004 and were proposed to be involved in the host immune response 15 .\nMore than 20 human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) miRNAs are identified and suggested to target several cellular genes to evade the immune system, control cell cycle and vesicle trafficking 16, 17 . The HIV encodes miRNAs, i.e. MiR-H3 and HIV1-miR-H1 were reported to enhance viral production and impairs cellular responses to infection, respectively 18, 19 .\nViral miRNAs have been found to target a large number of host genes involved in regulating cell proliferation, apoptosis, and host immunity 13 . The miR-HA-3p encoded by H5N1 accentuates the production of antiviral cytokines by targeting and repressing poly(rC)-binding protein 2 (PCBP2) expression, a known negative regulator of RIG/MAVS signaling, resulting in a high level of cytokine production and high mortality 20 . Also, viral miRNAs target the virus genes, which also help the virus to remain hidden from the host immune response. For example, miR-BART2 encoded by EBV was found to lie antisense to the EBV DNA polymerase gene BALF5 and was proposed to inhibit DNA polymerase expression by inducing cleavage within the 3'-UTR of BALF5 21 . Furthermore, given the importance of miRNA in regulating gene networks or pathways, viruses have evolved mechanisms to degrade, boost, or hijack cellular miRNAs to benefit the viral life cycle. Both Herpesvirus saimiri (HVS) and Murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) bind miR-27 with antisense, leading miR-27 degradation in a sequence-specific and binding-dependent manner, to promote T-cell activation and enhance viral replication, respectively 22, 23 . The non-translated region of North American eastern equine encephalitis virus genome base pairs with the miR-142-3p, resulted in a miR-142-3p mediated innate immune suppression 24 . Moreover, recent studies indicate the virus-encoded miRNAs, host-encoded miRNAs, and miRNA targets together form a novel regulatory system between the virus and the host, which contributes to the outcome of infection 25 . Hence, it is crucial to comprehensively understand the role of the novel regulatory system during SARS-COV-2 infection, then apply this information towards developing both new medicine and repurposing existing ones."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods Computational identification of SARS-CoV-2-encoded miRNA", "text": "The complete genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 (accession number: MN908947) was obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). The VMir software package (v2.2) 26 , an ab initio prediction program designed specifically to identify pre-miRNAs in viral genomes, was used to identify and visualize potential pre-miRNAs within the SARS-CoV-2 genome. The program examines all possible pre-miRNAs in the input sequence and consequently identifies a large number of potential candidates. The program slides a window of defined size across the entire sequence of interest, advancing each window by a given step size. The parameters of window and step sizes were set at 500 and 1 nt, respectively, as set in other literature. The Minimum Free Energy of the predicted hairpin structures were predicted with RNAFold algorithm from the Vienna package 27 . Hairpins with MEF > -20 kCal/mol were removed from the flowing analysis. Then HuntMi software was used to further distinguish miRNA hairpins from pseudo hairpins with a virus-based model 28 .

Finally, the sequence and position of mature miRNA within the pre-miRNA candidate were identified with MatureBayes, resulting in 90 mature miRNAs."}, {"section_title": "Virus miRNAs suppress host gene expression", "text": "The classical mechanism of miRNAs to regulate their target gene is by binding to the 3\u2032 UTR of mRNA to exert negative regulatory effects on gene expression. Human 3\u2032 UTR targets of the mature viral miRNAs were predicted and 40 miRNA were predicted to be binding to the 3\u2032 UTR of 73 genes. Gene ontology analysis revealed that the top functions of the target genes were enriched in the function of Notch binding, single-stranded DNA endodeoxyribonuclease activity, deoxyribonuclease activity, cellular response to peptide hormone stimulus and regulation of fatty acid metabolic process ( Figure   2A ). One of the common related biological processes involved by the notch signaling pathway, DNA endodeoxyribonuclease, and deoxyribonuclease is apoptosis, which is considered as a powerful mechanism to curtail viral spread 37 . However, consequently, viruses have evolved sophisticated molecular strategies to subvert host cell apoptotic defenses. A couple of studies have investigated the mechanism by which viruses modulating apoptosis signaling 16, 38 . The targeted gene annotated to the related GO items included CHAC1 and RAD9A among others, which were targeted by the virus-encoded miRNA, namely MD2-5p and MR147-3p, respectively ( Figure 2B ). CHAC1 (cation transport regulator-like protein 1) is a proapoptotic enzyme and a regulator of Notch signaling. RAD9A is a cell cycle checkpoint protein required for cell cycle arrest and DNA damage repair in response to DNA damage. RAD9A interacts with BCL-2/BCL-xL, the most important genes that regulate cell death, and promote apoptosis 39 . The suppressive role of the SARS-CoV-2-encode miRNAs on these genes suggested the possible role of them in reducing the host cell apoptotic to subvert host defense.\nOn the other hand, the involvement of the targeted genes in the biological process of cellular response to peptide hormone stimulus and regulation of fatty acid metabolic process might imply the role of them in the pathological damage. Genes enriched in these biological processes included FOXO3, ADIPOQ, and ADIPOR1, among others. The FOXO family represents a group of transcription factors that are required for many stress-related transcriptional programs including antioxidant response, gluconeogenesis, cell cycle control, apoptosis, and autophagy 40 "}, {"section_title": "Virus miRNA activate host gene expression", "text": "Besides the repression role of miRNA on the target genes, miRNAs were also found to target at promoter regions of genes to activate their expression 43 . Therefore, we also searched the targets of SARS-CoV-2 encoded miRNA on the 5\u2032 UTR of human genes. The 11 virus miRNAs were identified to be bind to the 5'-UTR of 13 target genes, including the binding between MR385-3p and TGFBR3\n(Transforming Growth Factor Beta Receptor 3) is a gene widely expressed on cells of both the innate and adaptive immune system and it is reported to play a role in promoting Th1 differentiation and regulation of regulatory T-cell activation and survival 44 .\nAccumulating evidence has proved that miRNA can also activate gene expression by targeting enhancers region in the nucleus 11 . We then downloaded the tissue-specific enhancer sequences from the EnhancerAlta for five tissues which were reported to be affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection, i.e. lung, gut, spleen, liver, and heart. Target prediction revealed that the lung is with the largest number of genes targeted by miRNA on the enhancer, followed by spleen and gut ( Figure 3A ). Functional annotation of these targeted genes revealed a notable enrichment in chemokine signaling pathways and cell skeleton related functions, such as actin filament-based process, actin cytoskeleton organization and cytoskeleton organization in the lung ( Figure 3B ). For example, MR147-5p targeted at the putative enhancer region of CXCL16 and ARRB2. CXCL16 was reported to regulate cell-mediated immunity to salmonella enterica serovar snteritidis via the promotion of gamma Interferon (IFN-\u03b3) production 45 . ARRB2 (arrestin beta-2) plays an important role in inflammation, the deficiency of it abolishes ovalbumin-evoked T lymphocyte and eosinophil infiltration of the lungs and eliminates Th2 cytokine production in the lungs. Another category of genes was related to the cell cytoskeleton organization, e.g. MYH9 (myosin-9) and ITGB5 (Integrin beta-5). Actin cytoskeleton is critical for viral replication at many stages of the viral life cycle, and viruses can subvert the force-generating and macromolecular scaffolding properties of the actin cytoskeleton to propel viral surfing, internalization, and migration within the cell 46,47 . These observations suggested the possible role of SARS-CoV-2 encoded miRNA in causing increased inflammation in the lung and facilitating the virus invasion.\nIn the spleen, the target genes were mainly related to the inflammatory response, i.e. regulation of chronic inflammatory response and positive regulation of chronic inflammatory response to antigenic stimulus ( Figure 3C ). For example, MR66-3p was predicted to bind to the enhancer of TNF-\u03b1, one of the most important cytokines in the \"cytokine storm\".\nIn the gut, 54 genes were predicted to be enhanced by 34 miRNAs. The most notable target of the virus miRNA is TMPRSS2, which is reported to enhance SARS-CoV-2 infection together with ACE2 48 In the liver, the virus miRNA mainly regulates genes involved in the function of actin filament severing and regulation of cellular protein metabolic process ( Figure 3E ). MR198-3p act on the enhancer of ADAR, an adenosine deaminases that act on RNA. ADAS is also indicated to act as a suppressor of IFN system responses in various virus infections 53 . It has been reported that a substantial proportion of COVID-19 patients showed signs of various degrees of liver damage, the mechanism and implication of which have not yet been determined. The multiple targets of SARS-CoV-2 encoded miRNA on the enhancer of genes which were highly expressed in the liver implicated a possible role of virus miRNA on the liver damage of COVID-19.\nThe MYH9 (non-muscle myosin heavy chain 9) was enhanced by SARS-CoV-2 derived MR359-5p in all the detected tissues except for the heart. In a study on PRRS virus (Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus), a positive sense, single-stranded RNA virus that causes highly infectious porcine disease, MYH9 has been proved to provide a bridge between the attachment of virus particles to cell surface receptors and the subsequent un-coating events required for genomic release within the host cell 54 . RXRA is another gene that may be activated by virus-encoded miRNA MR328-5p in the four tissue mentioned above. A study has shown that RXRA over-expression or ligand activation increases host susceptibility to viral infections in vitro and in vivo by attenuates host antiviral response through suppressing type I interferon 55 . The putative upregulation of MYH9 and RARA by virus-encoded miRNA might provide additional evidence for the invasion of SARS-CoV-2 to the four human tissues, as well as a mechanism by which the viruses enter and release from the cells and escape from the innate immune system."}, {"section_title": "Virus genome hijacks host miRNA to regulate immune response", "text": "Several studies have reported that the virus genome can hijack host miRNA to modulate host biological processes. For example, the virus transcript HSUR of Herpesvirus saimiri (HVS) base pairs with the host miRNA 27 (miR-27), leading to miRNA degradation in a sequence-specific and binding-dependent manner, and subsequent activation of infected T cells; HCMV produces a bicistronic mRNA that mediates degradation of cellular miR-17/miR-20a family miRNAs similarly.\nA total of 28 human miRNA were predicted to target at the SARS-Cov-2 genome. Since these miRNAs were hijacked by the virus genome, we could suppose that the genes that originally targeted by these miRNA could be affected. There were more than human 800 genes were predicted to be regulated by these miRNA (Figure 4A) , and a notable enrichment at the immune system process was observed There were 27 SARS-CoV-2 encoded miRNA that can target the virus genome ( Figure 5A ). Forty-three targets were predicted for the 27 miRNAs and most of them were bind to the ORFlab region ( Figure   5B ), the longest ORF in the SARS-Cov-2 genome. There were 2 miRNA targets at the 5\u2032 UTR of the virus genome, and 2 at the S gene, which encodes a spike glycoprotein to bind its receptor ACE2 on human cells, and mediates membrane fusion and virus entry(5)."}, {"section_title": "Virus genomic region targeted by virus and host miRNA", "text": "Twenty-eight human miRNAs were predicted to have 30 targets on the SASRS-CoV-2 genome ( Figure   5B ). Most of the human miRNAs were bind to the ORF1ab, where the enzymes for virus replication and translation were encoded. Followed by 7 miRNA targeted at the N genes of the virus, and 2 at the 5\u2032 UTR. It has been reported that miR-323, miR-491, and miR-654 inhibit replication of the H1N1 influenza A virus through binding to the polymerase PB1 gene 20 . And miR-122 binding to the HCV genome alters the structure of the 5\u2032 UTR in a manner that promotes viral RNA translation. A human miRNA, hsa-miR-4661-3p, was predicted to target at the genomic region 25,296-25,320 within S genes (21, 384) , which is the potential 3\u2032 UTR of the S gene transcript ( Figure 5C ). This observation "}, {"section_title": "Mutations in virus genome affect miRNA function", "text": "Mutations accumulated since the SARS-CoV-2 emerged, studies have implicated that the mutations on the virus genome may lead to an attenuated phenotype of SARS-CoV-2. We, therefore, explored whether miRNA encoded by either virus or human contributed to the fitness of SARS-CoV-2 to human.\nA total of 810 mutations on the SARS-CoV-2 genome were collected from China National Center for Bioinformation, including 646 SNPs, 19 indels and 145 deletions ( Figure 1B ). There were 33 pre-miRNAs located within the mutant region, i.e. 30 pre-miRNAs overlapped with SNPs and 4 located in the deletion region, and the number of mutations within each pre-miRNA ranges from 1 to 5.\nWe then examined the effect of genomic mutations on the generation of miRNA in SARS-CoV-2. MFE is an indicator of the hairpin stability of pre-miRNA, the stability of pre-miRNA hairpin structure will be reduced with the increase of MFE. Compared with the wild-type pre-miRNA, the MFE of the mutant pre-miRNAs were significantly increased (paired Wilcox test p-value = 3.585e-05, Figure 6A ), indicating an overall decreased stability of the mutant-genome encoded pre-miRNA. The most affected pre-miRNA is MR369 with MFE increased from -21.7 kCal/mol to -14.7 kCal/mol, which was considered to not be able to form stable hairpin structure after introducing the mutations ( Figure 6B ).\nWe then focused on the miRNAs with increased MFE scores and those located in the deletion regions.\nIn the lung, human genes targeted by these miRNAs at enhancers were enriched in the function of positive regulation of MHC class I biosynthetic process, which refers to two genes, i.e. CITTA and NLRC5. CITTA is targeted by MR288-5p, and NLRC5 by MD202-5p. The protein encoded by CIITA is located in the nucleus and acts as a positive regulator of class II major histocompatibility complex gene transcription, and is referred to as the \"master control factor\" for the expression of these genes. NLRC5 is a member of the NLR family that acts as a transcriptional activator of MHC class I genes. Silencing of NLRC5 resulted in increased IL-6, TNF, CXCL5, and IL-1\u03b2 secretion\uff0cat the same time decreased secretion of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 59 . The intact pre-miRNA is predicted to generate mature miRNA that enhancer the gene expression of both CIITA and NLRC5, resulting in an enhanced inflammation. While in the mutant genome, the generation of these miRNAs might be disturbed, thus the enhanced effect was relieved. Additionally, in the spleen, a couple of target genes were enriched in the cytokine-mediated signaling pathway that was missed by the mutant pre-miRNA, including CCR6, OAS1, POMC, XAF1, TNFAIP3, CANX, NLRC5, SQSTM1, and CD27. These results suggested that the mutation in the region overlapped with miRNA might contribute to the attenuated phenotype of SARS-CoV-2 by changing the miRNA repertories encode by the virus.\nNext, we further explore the alteration of host miRNA target on the mutation virus genome.\nTwenty-two human miRNA can bind to the mutant genome, with 16 overlapped with those binding to the wild type genome ( Figure 6C ). The genes targeted by the newly recruited miRNA were annotated to the function of epithelial cell differentiation, actin filament fragmentation and so like, while the gene targeted by the miRNA specific binding to the wild type genome were annotated to the immune response-related progress ( Figure 6D ). The two miRNA as we described before, i.e. hsa-miR-939-5p and hsa-miR-146b-3p, which were involved in maintaining homeostasis by decreasing inflammatory, were predicted to be not capable of binding to the mutant wild type genome. Taken together, we speculate that the mutant type of virus might relieve the high level of immunity response, even the cytokine storm, which leads to the serve symptom or dead of COVID-2019, but on the other hand, enhance the invasion of the virus by intensifying the regulation of the epithelial differential and actin filament fragmentation, through attracting different batches of host miRNAs."}, {"section_title": "miRNA view of the difference between SARS-CoV-2 with other human coronaviruses", "text": "Comparing with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 appears to have higher transmission rates, but lower mortality 1,2 . To explore whether and how miRNA implicated in this difference between them, we predicted the miRNAs encoded by MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, as well as HCoV-NL63, a coronavirus that causes mild symptoms in human and uses the same acceptor with SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 for cellular entry (ACE2), using the same pipeline as applied SARS-CoV-2. The largest putative virus-encoded miRNA repository, i.e. 212 mature miRNAs, was detected from the MERS-CoV genome (Table 1) , followed by SARS-CoV with 168 miRNAs and SARS-CoV-2 with 90 miRNAs.\nHCoV-NL63 encodes the least number of miRNAs (64 miRNAs). Furthermore, the number of targets on the virus genome binding by the host miRNA follows the same trend (Table 1 ).\nFunctional analysis revealed that high enrichment of genes targeted by the virus-encoded miRNAs in the metabolic process was observed in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, but not in SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-NL630 ( Figure S1A ). Enrichment in inflammatory and leukocyte was observed in SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV-2, respectively ( Figure S1A ). For the genes \"hijacked\" by virus genome, the functional keywords were enriched in chemotaxis, cytokine, chemokine and immune for the entire four viruses studied ( Figure S1B ), and HCoV-NL63. But the miRNAs targeted at the virus genome were largely different from each other ( Figure S2 ). These results implicated that differences in miRNA repositories and miRNA-target interaction might be involved in the pathological difference among the four coronaviruses."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "In summary, this silico study revealed a systematic view of the possible role of the virus-encode miRNAs as well as the host-derived miRNAs influenced by the SARS-COV-2 infection, which provide insights from the perspective of miRNA into the biological process involved by the infection (Figure 7) . Impressively, the systematic analysis revealed that the immune response is the function most affected by the virus-infection introduced miRNA change in repository and targets, which might contribute to the immune evasion of the virus as well as the abnormal immunity activation in the host. The SARS-CoV-2-encoded miRNA is also implicated in the cytoskeleton dynamics that facilitating the virus envision, trafficking within the cell and release. The virus-encode miRNAs were also predicted to be able to repress the expression of genes involved apoptosis and regulating fatty acid metabolic process by binding at the 3\u2032 UTR of host genes. Additionally, the host miRNAs hijacked by the virus genome were mostly involved in the immune system process, such as hsa-miR-146b and hsa-miR-939.\nFurthermore, the host miRNA hsa-miR-4661-3p was predicted to bind at the potential 3\u2032 UTR of the S gene transcript with the possible role of a repressor on the expression of S gene. Finally, the genomic mutation-introduced alterations on the coding ability of virus miRNA and the targets of both virus and host miRNA might contribute to the attenuated phenotype of SARS-CoV-2 during its evolution. Finally, the comparison of miRNA repository and targets difference between SARS-CoV-2 with other human coronaviruses implicated the role of miRNAs in the shared and distinct clinical characteristics of them.\nWith further experiments to validate the role of candidate miRNAs in vivo, it is promissing to provide deep insight into the mechisms of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis from the pespective of miRNA."}, {"section_title": "Author contributions", "text": "XL conceived the project.
