[{"section_title": "Sources for Detailed Farm Loan Data", "text": "While many lenders, such as commercial banks or the Farm Credit System, report aggregate lending to farmers, it is difficult to measure other lending relationships, such as borrowing from individuals. For these types of lending relationships, economists typically rely on surveys of farm operators. The best source for national-level aggregate farm debt is the Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) jointly produced by USDA Economic Research Service and National Agricultural Statistics Service."}, {"section_title": "Farmers Seek Loans from a Variety of Lenders", "text": "The annual ARMS survey includes a series of questions that provide detailed information on the terms, age, interest rate, and lender type for (up to five) outstanding loans. Table 1 below presents the aggregate loan volume by lender type from the most recent ARMS, 2016, for real estate and non-real estate loans. The data indicate that the Farm Credit System and commercial banks supply the majority of debt to farm operators. The ARMS survey suggests that implement dealers provided a total of $11.2 billion in debt capital to farm operations in 2016. The majority (96%) of debt issued by implement dealers is concentrated in long term non-real estate debt, which largely consists of machinery and equipment loans. These data indicate that implement dealers provide 27% of the sector's long term non-real estate debt in 2016."}, {"section_title": "Implement Dealers' Increasing Market Share in Long Term Non-Real Estate Debt", "text": "The graph below shows the share of long term non-real estate debt by lender type. The yellow bars represent the market share by traditional lenders, including commercial banks, credit unions, the Farm Credit System, and Farmer Mac. The grey bars represent the market share of public lenders, including direct loans made by the Farm Service Agency (FSA), Small Business Administration (SBA), and other public programs. The orange bars represent the market share of implement dealers, and the remaining lenders are represented by the blue bars. The figure demonstrates the increasing role of implement dealer financing. Implement dealers' market share increased from 11% in 2003 to a high of 31% in 2013 and 2014.  "}, {"section_title": "Real", "text": ""}]
