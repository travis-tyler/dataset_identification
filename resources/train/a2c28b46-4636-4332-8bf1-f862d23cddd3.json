[{"section_title": "Agricultural Resources and Environmental Indicators, 2012", "text": "\u2022 In 2007, about 51 percent of the 2.3 billion acres in the United States was used for agricultural purposes, including cropping, grazing (in pasture, range, and forests), and farmsteads and farm roads. Total cropland acreage in 2007 reached its lowest level since the Major Land Use series began in 1945. Over 1959, forest-use land and grassland, pasture, and range also decreased, while land in special uses (primarily recreation areas, transportation, and national defense) and urban areas increased. \u2022 From 2000 to 2010, national aggregate farm real estate values appreciated faster than residential values. Traditionally, farmland values were driven largely by the returns from agricultural activities, but today in some regions farmland values are influenced by factors such as urban influence and income from hunting leases. As a result, cropland values in these regions greatly exceed their implied agricultural use value. \u2022 From 1948 to 2009, agricultural output grew 1.63 percent per year while aggregate input use increased only 0.11 percent annually, so positive growth in the farm sector was mainly due to productivity growth (1.52 percent per year). \u2022 Total agricultural research and development (R&D) funding generally increased since 2000; private sector funding grew to exceed that of the public sector, which grew slowly and sporadically until 2006 before declining. Private sector R&D tends to emphasize marketable goods, while public sector R&D tends to emphasize public goods like environmental protection, nutrition, and food safety. \u2022 Corn, cotton, and soybean growers have widely adopted genetically engineered herbicidetolerant and insect-resistant seeds since 1996. Despite higher prices for genetically engineered seed than for conventional seeds, U.S. farmers are realizing economic benefits from increased crop yields, lower pesticide costs, and/or management time savings. \u2022 Real expenditures (2010 US$) and quantities for pesticide active ingredients declined an average 2.4 percent and 1.4 percent, respectively, per year during 1996-2007, even though expenditures and quantities applied increased from 2006 to 2007. However, herbicide use increased, and increasing glyphosate use on herbicide-tolerant crops and reduced diversity of weed management practices are associated with increased weed resistance. \u2022 Commercial fertilizer consumption fell from 23 million short tons in 2004 to 21 million short tons in 2010, with high fertilizer prices contributing to the decline. Since 2004, nitrogen recovery rates (amount removed by harvested crop/amount applied) on corn and cotton have increased, and the shares of planted acreage where application rates exceed 125 percent of the crop's agronomic need have decreased. Phosphate recovery rates are relatively unchanged for corn and cotton. Mining phosphate in soybean plantings increased. \u2022 In recent decades, onfarm irrigation efficiency-the share of applied water that is beneficially used by the crop-has increased: from 1984 to 2008, total irrigated acres in the West increased by 2.1 million acres, while water applied declined by nearly 100,000 acre-feet, reflecting improved water-use efficiency, as well as changes in irrigated acreage and regional cropping patterns. \u2022 Since 2000, corn, cotton, soybean, and wheat acreage under conservation tillage (mulch, ridge, and no till) has increased, which may reduce soil erosion and water pollution but increase pest management costs. Over that same time, continuous corn and corn-inclusive rotations increased and continuous soybeans decreased due to higher corn prices, with uncertain effects on erosion and water pollution. Erosion control structures and conservation buffers are more widely used on highly erodible land than on other land, but overall, structures were more widely used and buffers less widely used on cotton and wheat than on corn and soybeans. \u2022 From 2004 to 2011, organic food sales more than doubled from $11 billion to $25 billion, accounting for over 3.5 percent of food sales in 2011. In 2008, growers practiced certified organic production on less than 1 percent of U.S. cropland and pasture/rangeland, but the percentage is higher for fruit/vegetable crops and for dairy production. \u2022 Federal funding for voluntary programs that encourage land retirement and adoption of conservation practices on working lands was $5.5 billion in 2010, higher than at any time since 1960 (when expressed in 2010 dollars); funding increased nearly tenfold for working- "}, {"section_title": "Farm Resources and Land Use", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Farm Numbers and Size", "text": "Robert A.

Falling farm numbers during this period reflect growing productivity in agriculture and increased nonfarm employment opportunities. Growing productivity led to excess capacity in agriculture, farm consolidation, and the exit of farm operators to work in the nonfarm economy. The decline in farm numbers slowed in the 1980s and halted in the 1990s, reflecting increases in the number of very small farms whose operators do not depend on farming for their livelihood. By 2007, there were about 2.2 million farms. Because the amount of farmland did not decrease as much as the number of farms, farms today have more acreage, on average. Farms averaged 418 acres in 2007, compared with 155 acres in 1935. But averages can be deceiving because of the diversity of today's farms. Farms range from very small retirement and residential farms to large operations with sales in the millions of dollars. Part of this diversity stems from the low sales threshold ($1,000) necessary for an operation to qualify as a farm. Farm Diversity-Classifying Small and Large Farms One way to view the diversity of farms is to categorize them into more homogeneous groups.

Receipt of commodity program payments depends on past or current production of specific commodities covered by farm programs. Since these farms harvest about four-fifths of the land in program commodities (largely food and feed grains, oilseeds, and cotton), they receive a similar share of commodity program payments. However, land-retirement programs-the Conservation Reserve Program, Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program, and Wetlands Reserve Program-are targeted at environmentally sensitive land, not the production of commodities. Since small farms account for 62 percent of the land owned by farms, they play a large role in natural resource and environmental policy. Retirement, residential/lifestyle, and low-sales farms together received 69 percent of landretirement payments in 2009. Participating farmers in each of the three groups tend to enroll large shares of their land in these programs: 52 percent of the land operated for retirement farms, 38 percent for residential/lifestyle farms, and 25 percent for low-sales farms.

Given their lifecycle position, many retired farmers have land available to put into conservation uses. The same forces may also be acting on low-sales operators, who average 59 years of age and may be scaling down their operations. Working-land programs provide technical and financial assistance to farmers using conservation practices on land in production.

In the conterminous 48 States, grassland pasture and range represents the largest share of the land base. Land-use patterns vary greatly by region, reflecting differences in soils, climate, topography, population, and the relative profitability of having land in a particular use. For example, cropland accounts for 54 percent of all land in the Corn Belt but only 12 percent in the Northeast (fig. 1.2.1). Similarly, variation exists among States within a region. Almost two-thirds of North Dakota is cropland, versus 41 percent in South Dakota. State-level estimates are available in the ERS Major Land Uses data product (http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/major-land-uses.aspx). Land shifts in and out of uses for a variety of reasons. Changing commodity and timber prices, agricultural and natural resource policies and, more recently, bioenergy policies prompt private landowners to shift land to uses that maximize returns to land. Land near urban areas is also subject to residential, commercial, and industrial development pressure; however, once converted to an urban use, land rarely transitions back to less intensive agricultural or forestry uses. "}, {"section_title": "Farm Real Estate Values and Cash Rent", "text": "Allison Borchers and Todd Kuethe Farm real estate (all agricultural land and buildings) accounts for the largest share of total farm assets, at roughly 84 percent in 2009. Farm real estate values underpin the financial health of farm operations and support farm household and community financial well-being. Therefore, prevailing farm real estate values play an important role in agricultural policy related to farm income and finance, farmland conservation, program payments, and farm ownership and tenure. Farm real estate values have increased consistently following the 1980s farm crisis and have exhibited above-average growth in recent years (fig. 1.3.1). From 2000 to 2010, national aggregate farm real estate values appreciated at an average of 7 percent annually (4.7 percent in inflation-adjusted terms). In contrast, residential real estate values appreciated 3.2 percent annually over the same period, according to the Federal Housing Finance Administration's housing price index. Residential prices famously declined at an average annual rate of 4.4 percent from 2007 to 2010, while farm real estate values continued to increase at an annual rate of 2.4 percent. Farm Real Estate Values Exhibit Regional Variation Regional variation in farmland values is significant, owing to general economic conditions, the health of the local farm economy, public policy, and location-specific characteristics. In the Northeast, 2010 farm real estate values were over twice the national average, whereas values in the Mountain region were less than half the national average (table 1.3.1). High farm real estate values in the Pacific States and Corn Belt are partly a reflection of high-value specialty crops and favorable prices for field crops, respectively. In the Mountain region, the predominance of cattle ranching results in lower per-acre value of agricultural land.     Productivity can be measured by a single factor such as corn production per acre (yield or land productivity) or per unit of labor (labor productivity). But such measures can be misleading. For example, yields could increase simply because farmers are adding more of other inputs, such as chemicals or machinery. USDA's Economic Research Service produces measures of total factor productivity (TFP) that account for the use of all inputs to the production process."}, {"section_title": "---------------------------------$ per acre---------------------------------", "text": "Under the USDA-ERS TFP measure, annual productivity growth is the difference between growth of agricultural output and the growth of all inputs taken together (Ball et al., 1997;Ball et al., 2011). Productivity, therefore, measures changes in the efficiency with which inputs are transformed into outputs. Inputs are adjusted for changes in quality, such as improvements in the efficacy of chemicals and changes in the demographics of the farm workforce.

Nearly all production improvements are the result of research and development (R&D) in the areas of mechanics (e.g., farm equipment), biology (e.g., plant varieties and animal breeds), or management (e.g., integrated pest management). Likewise, the consumers of agricultural products also depend on scientific reports for information about nutrition, food safety, and environmental quality. Much of the science used in agriculture comes from the life sciences. For example, plant varieties need resistance to pests and diseases and tolerance to nonbiological stresses such as drought and heat. Some stressors can be managed chemically or physically, for example, by controlling pests with insecticides or delivering water by irrigation. Even in these cases, the biological basis of the plant or pest must be understood. But many stressors can be managed best by utilizing inherent resistance in the plant or animal variety. Because pests and diseases evolve, R&D (particularly prebreeding and breeding) is continually needed to maintain or improve yields per acre. . GE seeds have genes that provide specific traits such as herbicide tolerance (HT) and insect resistance. HT crops tolerate potent herbicides, allowing adopters of these varieties to control pervasive weeds more effectively. Insect-resistant (Bt) crops contain genes from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis that produces a protein toxic to specific insects, protecting the plant over its entire life. Although other traits are being developed (including virus and fungus resistance; cold and drought resistance; and enhanced protein, oil, or vitamin content), crops with HT and Bt traits are the most prominent GE crops currently on the market.

However, real expenditures (in 2010 dollars) and quantities declined 2.4 percent and 1.4 percent, respectively, per year during 1996-2007, on average. During this period, herbicides and plant growth regulators accounted for 63 percent of both expenditures and quantities applied, insecticides and miticides for 21 percent of expenditures and 11 percent of quantity, fungicides for 10 percent and 7 percent, and other chemicals (e.g., nematicides, fumigants, and rodenticides) for 7 percent of expenditures and 20 percent of quantities applied. U.S. corn, cotton, fall potatoes, soybeans, and wheat accounted for nearly two-thirds of pesticide quantities applied. In this chapter, we examine pesticide use and management practices for these five crops more closely, using detailed Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) data. Total pesticide use on these crops was stable during 1982-2010, increasing in some years and declining in others, with an average annual increase of 0.2 percent (fig. 3.1.1). 1 Herbicide and insecticide quantities applied declined 0.2 percent and 3.9 percent per year, while fungicide and otherchemical (e.g., desiccants, growth regulators, and vine killers) quantities increased 3.3 and 6.0 percent (O'Donoghue et al., 2011;Osteen and Livingston, 2006). Changes in the use of pesticides during this period are due to several factors, including the widespread adoption of genetically engineered crops, the expiration of the glyphosate patent in 2000, the availability of new compounds with lower application rates, boll-weevil eradication, and changes in pesticide prices, which increased slowly compared to the prices of other inputs such as fertilizer (fig. 3.1.2). Of the five crops, 53 percent of the pesticide total was applied to corn in 1982, followed by soybeans (28 percent), cotton (9.6 percent), fall potatoes (4.8 percent), and wheat (4.5 percent). Corn's share declined to 43 percent in 2010, while fall potatoes' share increased to 20 percent (because of large increases in the application of other chemicals, particularly vine killers such as sulfuric acid). Herbicides accounted for the largest share of pesticides applied throughout 1982-2010, while the other-chemicals category increased most in share.

With the widespread adoption of herbicide-tolerant (HT) corn, cotton, and soybeans during 1996-2007, the use of post-emergence herbicides increased, particularly for soybeans, while the use of preemergence herbicides first declined and then leveled off, for corn and cotton, and increased for soybeans. The percentage of winter-wheat acres receiving pre-emergence herbicides increased slowly and steadily during this period, while the percentage of acres receiving post-emergence herbicides declined and then increased somewhat. The share of planted acres on which pesticides are rotated to slow resistance trended downward during 1996-2007, particularly for soybeans. This trend-along with the widespread adoption of HT crops and the popularity of glyphosate-might help explain why glyphosate resistance is an emerging problem facing producers of corn, cotton, and soybeans. Changes in insect management practices are less apparent.

Whether or not improved water-use efficiency eases basin-level water-supply constraints, onfarm water conservation may contribute to farmer and societal welfare, improved fish and wildlife habitat, and reduced ecosystem and human health risks associated with environmental degradation. In recent decades, onfarm irrigation efficiency-the share of applied water that is beneficially used by the crop-has increased. FRIS survey data reveal a marked shift to more efficient irrigation application systems, reducing average per-acre applied water rates across crops and regions. While an important concern across U.S. irrigated agriculture, irrigation efficiency is of particular importance across the arid Western States, where water demand for agriculture is greatest and where competing water demands and shifting water regimes under climate change are projected to place additional strain on available water supplies for agriculture. In 1984, gravity systems-which used roughly 54 percent more water per acre than pressurized systems, on average-accounted for more than 70 percent of all water applied for crop agriculture in the 17 Western States. By 2008, gravity systems applied less than half of all irrigation water, while water used with pressure systems accounted for 52 percent of water applied (fig. 3.3.1). At the same time, continued efficiency advances were achieved with both gravity and pressure systems. By 2008, fewer acre-feet of water were required to irrigate a greater number of acres, reflecting improved water-use efficiency, as well as changes in irrigated acreage distributions and regional cropping patterns. From 1984 to 2008, total irrigated acres in the West increased by 2.1 million acres, while water applied declined by nearly 100,000 acre-feet. In 2008, applied water rates in the region averaged 2.4 acre-feet per acre for gravity systems and 1.4 acre-feet for pressure systems. 5 While substantial technological innovation has already occurred in U.S. irrigated agriculture, additional water-use efficiency gains are achievable. Figure 3.3.2 shows changes, from 1994 to 2008, in the share of Western irrigated acres using more efficient irrigation systems (as defined in the figure's legend). More than half of irrigated cropland acres in the West continue to be irrigated with more traditional, less efficient application systems, for both gravity and pressure irrigation systems. Continued investment in irrigation efficiency will depend on adoption incentives at the farm level, including factors that influence investment returns (e.g., crop value, water/energy, and system upgrade costs), access to capital, and production risk."}, {"section_title": "Private and Public Investment in Irrigation Improvements", "text": "Irrigators continue to make significant capital investments in irrigation equipment and infrastructure. Approximately $2.15 billion was spent on irrigation systems (beyond expenditures for maintenance and repair) across U.S. farms in 2008. Nearly three-fourths of these capital investments were on land in the West, where the vast majority of irrigated land is located. About 52 percent of on-farm expenditures in the West were driven by replacement of existing equipment and machinery; upgrades in irrigation facilities and equipment (where water conservation was identified as the primary purpose) accounted for 17 percent. Investment in new equipment accounted for nearly 31 percent of all investment expenditures.  (1984, 1988, 1994, 1998, 2003, and 2008).

Traditional irrigation includes systems other than those defined above for more efficient gravity/sprinkler irrigation (largely including high-pressure sprinkler and unlined furrow and flood systems without field borders). More efficient pressure-sprinkler irrigation includes acres irrigated using either drip/trickle systems or lower pressure sprinkler systems [pressure per square inch (PSI) < 30].

While soil characteristics such as texture and distance to bedrock may not be easily or quickly altered, farm management strategies for crop residue management, crop rotations, and soil conservation structures can improve or maintain dynamic soil quality, mitigate environmental damage, and raise economic returns. Soil quality reflects the capacity of soil to facilitate nutrient cycling; regulate water flow; maintain physical stability; neutralize environmental pollutants; and provide habitat, food, and fiber."}, {"section_title": "No-till Drives Increase in Conservation Tillage", "text": "The amount and type of tillage used in crop residue management systems has become a critical issue for farm managers and policymakers alike as fuel prices rise, air quality issues continue to gain attention, crop mixes requiring increased soil moisture increase in acreage, and the carbon sequestration potential of agricultural soils gains policy relevance. \"No-till\" farming has seen increases in acreage across all major crops. Conservation tillage that maintains residue cover provides environmental benefits and improves both agronomic and economic efficiency. The reduction in fuel and labor expenditures due to fewer tillage passes over the field can boost farm profits. Additionally, farms using crop residue management retain more moisture by trapping snow, decreasing water evaporation from the top layer of soil, and improving water infiltration to plant root systems. Environmental benefits include reduced soil erosion and water pollution "}, {"section_title": "Corn-Soybeans and Continuous Cropping Remain Dominant Cropping Patterns", "text": "The choice to rotate crops-which helps to cycle nutrients, break pest cycles, and maintain or improve soil quality-is contingent on the relative rates of return for candidate crops. Rotations may consist of strictly spring-planted crops, or may involve fall-planted crops or cover crops. The most common rotation, corn and soybeans, demonstrates several of the major agronomic and environmental advantages to crop rotation. By alternating a nitrogen-dependent grain (corn) with a nitrogen-fixing legume (soybeans), nitrogen fertilizer needs are reduced. Yields have been shown to increase for grain-legume rotations irrespective of fertilizer rates. Weeds, insects, and disease are disrupted by crop rotation, which allows farmers to save on pesticide application and costs. Rotating closely grown crops, such as small grains, with row crops increases vegetative cover and can reduce soil losses due to water and wind erosion, thereby reducing nutrient and pesticide runoff into waterways. Crop rotations that include legumes, row crops, and small grains are most effective at disrupting weed, insect, and disease cycles. Market factors-including relative commodity prices and input prices-greatly affect crop rotation decisions. The past decade has seen increased corn grain prices in addition to higher commercial fertilizer prices. High corn prices could lead to more continuous corn, while a desire to contain fertilizer expenses could encourage rotation of crops that require less fertilizer.    Still, many U.S. producers are embracing organic farming in order to lower input costs, conserve nonrenewable resources, capture high-value markets, and boost farm income. While only a small percentage of the top U.S. field crops-corn (0.2 percent), soybeans (0.2 percent), and wheat (0.7 percent)-were certified organic in 2008, nearly 9 percent of U.S. vegetable crop acres and 3 percent of U.S. fruit and tree nut acres were grown under certified organic farming systems. Markets for organic vegetables, fruits, and herbs have been developing for decades in the United States, and fresh produce is still the top-selling organic category in retail sales. Organic livestock was beginning to catch up with produce in 2008, with 2.7 percent of U.S. dairy cows and 1.5 percent of layer hens managed under certified organic systems."}, {"section_title": "U.S. organic and conventional operations: selected characteristics and practices", "text": "Obstacles to adoption by farmers include high managerial costs and risks of shifting to a new way of farming and limited knowledge of organic farming and marketing systems. According to Lynn Clarkson, a top organic grain broker, specific obstacles to adoption in organic grain production include the 3-year lag due to the organic transition period requirement, fewer organic marketing outlets, the need for onfarm storage, the lack of third-party contractors for organic pest and nutrient management, heavy managerial requirements, fear of criticism from neigh-  bors, unknown risks, lack of government infrastructure support, and subsidies for ethanol that increase demand for conventional grain supplies (Clarkson, 2007)."}, {"section_title": "Organic operations accounted for less than 1 percent of total crop acreage in 2008", "text": "Producers also face many challenges once they have shifted to organic production. Respondents to USDA's 2005 organic dairy producer survey indicated that certification paperwork and compliance costs were the most challenging aspect of organic milk production, followed by finding new organic sources of feed and dairy replacements, higher costs of production, and maintaining animal health (McBride and Greene, 2009). In the produce sector, a recent California study of small and mid-sized organic farmers, producing mostly fruit and vegetables, found that more than 80 percent reported marketing challenges-having too much or too little volume, obtaining organic price premiums, locating and accessing markets, handling competition, and accessing information on pricing (Cantor and Strochlic, 2009). \u2022 Working-land programs provide technical and financial assistance to farmers who install or maintain conservation practices that support crop and livestock production. Common practices include nutrient management, conservation tillage, field-edge filter strips, and fences to exclude livestock from streams. \u2022 Agricultural land preservation programs purchase rights to certain land uses, such as housing or other development, to maintain land in agricultural use. \u2022 USDA provides, through Conservation Technical Assistance, ongoing technical assistance to agricultural producers who seek to improve the environmental performance of their farms. Environmental compliance is a notable exception to the largely voluntary nature of U.S. agrienvironmental programs. Under highly erodible land conservation provisions (often referred to as \"Sodbuster\" for land not cropped before 1985 and \"Conservation Compliance\" for land cropped before 1985), farmers who crop highly erodible land must apply an approved soil conservation system or risk losing nearly all agriculture-related farm program benefits, including commodity, conservation, and disaster payments. Under wetland conservation (often referred to as \"Swampbuster\"), producers must refrain from draining wetlands or face the loss of most agriculture-related program benefits. It is not clear that conservation spending will continue to rise in the future. The Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 reduced the CRP acreage cap to 32 million acres, slowing spending in that program. If the demand for major commodities (e.g., corn, soybeans, and wheat) continues to be strong and market prices for these commodities continue to be well above historic levels, farmers may be unwilling to enroll land in CRP unless annual payments are increased to match the profits from crop production. Under such a scenario, CRP expenditures could jump or the program's acreage could shrink.  (compared with an acceptance rates ranging between 48 and 74 percent in the signups between 1997 and 2006). A high share of offered acres were re-enrollments (over 85 percent in 2011), suggesting that the pool of landowners interested in the CRP may be shrinking. Furthermore, enrollment seems to be shifting toward less productive land, with rental payments for newly accepted general signup acres basically constant between 2006 and 2011. As the total acreage enrolled via CRP's general signups has declined, \"continuous signups\"including land in one of the many State-Federal conservation partnerships under the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP)-have increased. This acreage, which is targeted to address high-priority environmental concerns and is subject to more stringent eligibility requirements, grew from 3.7 million acres in 2007 to over 5.3 million acres in June 2012. Further growth in continuous signups is likely as targeted conservation practices and sites are identified. For example, about three-fourths of the 850,000 continuous signup acres allocated to the 2008 State Acres for Wildlife Enhancement initiative have been enrolled. New initiatives continue to emerge, such as the Louisiana Coastal Prairie CREP and expansion of Nebraska's Platte-Republican CREP, as high valued conservation opportunities are developed.

Much of the 17-percent increase in conservation funding authorized by the 2008 Farm Act goes toward two working-lands programs-the Environmental Quality Incentives Program and the Conservation Stewardship Program. These programs provide producers with financial and technical assistance for implementing and managing a wide range of conservation practices for crop, livestock, and forest production."}, {"section_title": "Two Different Program Designs Are Used", "text": "The Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) is the largest working-lands program in terms of funding and acreage. Established in 1996, EQIP's principal objective is to (1) promote production and environmental quality as compatible goals, (2) optimize environmental benefits, and (3) help farmers and ranchers meet Federal, State, and local regulatory requirements. Financial assistance is in the form of a cost share. Farmers seeking to participate in EQIP complete an application indicating which land on the farm will be enrolled, which resource concerns will be addressed, and what practices will be used. Contract selections are made at the State or local level. Total authorized funding for 2008-12 is $7.25 billion, 60 percent of which is targeted to natural resource concerns related to poultry and livestock production. The remainder is directed toward practices that address conservation priorities on working cropland. In 2010, EQIP obligated $839 million to treat 13 million acres of land. The goal of the Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP) is to encourage producers to address resource concerns in a comprehensive manner by (1) undertaking additional conservation activities, and (2) improving, maintaining, and managing existing conservation activities. To participate in CSP, farmers and ranchers must, at minimum, have already addressed at least one resource concern throughout their farm, and agree to address at least one additional priority resource concern during the 5-year contract term. CSP pays participants for conservation performance-the higher the performance, the higher the payment. Performance is measured with the Conservation Measurement Tool. Using a point-based scoring system, the environmental benefits associated with each activity are assessed. Additional activities receive a higher payment rate than existing activities. This creates an incentive for landowners to provide more conservation than a simple cost-share might.   "}]
