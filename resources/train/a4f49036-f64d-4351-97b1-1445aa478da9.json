[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Purpose: To examine cigarette use and the tobacco-related environment among adolescents living in metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas.\nData from adolescents ages 14-17 that completed the 2012 Florida Youth Tobacco Survey were analyzed (n = 40,746). This includes a representative sample of middle and high school students throughout the state.\nResults: Nonmetropolitan adolescents were more likely than metropolitan adolescents to report lifetime smoking, past 30-day smoking, daily smoking, initiating smoking at younger ages, having smoked a greater number of cigarettes in their lifetime and in the past 30 days, friend acceptance of adult smoking, a parent offering them a cigarette, living with a smoker, and that smoking was allowed in their home. Nonmetropolitan adolescents were also more likely to have seen tobacco ads the last time they visited convenience marts, gas stations, grocery stores, and big box stores, and flavored tobacco products or ads for them. These differences persisted after controlling for demographics.\nThe present results suggest vast differences in smoking behavior among nonmetropolitan and metropolitan adolescents and that targeting social and environmental factors may be beneficial for reducing tobacco disparities among nonmetropolitan adolescents."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "Individuals living in nonmetropolitan (nonmetro) areas suffer disproportionately from tobacco use [1] [2] [3] [4] and tobacco-related illness compared to individuals living in metropolitan (metro) areas. 5 National and state-level surveys consistently show that adolescent [1] [2] [3] [6] [7] [8] and adult 9 tobacco use is higher in nonmetro areas than in metro areas. Smoking rates among adolescents are of particular concern, since the majority of smokers begin smoking prior to age 18. 10 Nationally, in 2013, the Monitoring the Future (MTF) study showed that past 30-day cigarette smoking was higher in nonmetro areas compared to metro areas among 8th (8.0% vs 2.5%), 10th (13.0% vs 5.8%), and 12th graders (20.9% vs 14.5%). 11 Few empirical studies have investigated how patterns of cigarette use differ among metro and nonmetro adolescents. Only one study reported that the mean age of initial smokeless tobacco use was over a year earlier in rural adolescents, compared to urban adolescents. 12 No studies have examined how age of initiation of cigarette smoking varies among metro and nonmetro youth. One study, however, found that 14% of rural adolescents report heavy (eg, daily) smoking compared to 10% of urban high school students. 2 Understanding differences in patterns of cigarette consumption among nonmetro and metro adolescents is essential for tailoring tobacco-related interventions to address tobacco-related disparities in smoking among rural populations.\nFew studies to date have examined how the tobaccorelated context differs for metro and nonmetro adolescents. Previous research suggests that a wide variety of factors, at multiple levels, influence cigarette smoking. For example, research shows that individual (eg, gender and age 11 ), family (eg, disapproval of use, attitudes, and behavior [13] [14] [15] ), peer (eg, disapproval of use, attitudes, and behavior 16 ), and community characteristics (eg, rates of use and availability) 17 play an important role in smoking behavior, particularly among adolescents. Utilizing a social-ecological framework, Connell and associates examined factors associated with patterns of substance use, including tobacco, among a large sample of nonmetro high school students. The authors found that peer substance use had the largest effect on substance use among this sample. The authors also found that family and community characteristics were consistently related to patterns of use including parental disapproval and availability of substances. 18 One limitation of this study, however, is that the authors did not examine factors associated with tobacco use specifically.\nThis study addresses several important gaps in the literature about smoking disparities in rural communities. First, differences in cigarette use among metro and nonmetro adolescents are examined across a range of indices, including age of initiation and detailed cigarette consumption measures. Second, the current study utilizes an ecological framework to examine how a range of smoking-specific factors at the individual, peer, family, and community levels vary among metro and nonmetro adolescents. Utilizing an ecological framework provides a broader understanding of factors that contribute to disparities in cigarette smoking among nonmetro adolescents."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Overview of the Florida Youth Tobacco Survey", "text": "The Florida Youth Tobacco Survey (FYTS) is a schoolbased survey administered annually by the Florida Department of Health. The sample includes middle and high school students across the state, using a 2-stage cluster probability design. First, a random sample of public middle and high schools is selected. Second, a random sample of classrooms is selected from each school, and all students in the selected classrooms are invited to participate in the survey. In the odd years, the survey is administered in 43 counties across the state (with a much smaller sample size) and the data are only weighted to the state population that represents those who took the survey (middle/high school). In even years, data are collected in all 67 counties across the state and the data are weighted to both the state and county population that represents those who took the survey (middle/high school). All counties required parental consent (65 counties used passive and 2 counties used active consent procedures). This study focuses on the 2012 data, in which the data are weighted to the county population.\nThe 2012 FYTS was administered in the spring of 2012 to 75,428 total students within 746 public schools, of which 38,989 attended middle school and 36,439 attended high schools. The overall survey response rate for middle schools was 77%, and the overall survey response rate for high schools was 73%. Data were collected from 66 of the 67 counties in Florida, with one county abstaining (Osceola County) and another removed due to unrepresentative sampling (Hardee County). 19 Participants between 14 and 17 years of age at the time of survey were included in the present study (n = 40,746). The majority of youth included were in high school (grades 9-12; 82.2%), or at the end of middle school (8th grade; 14.9%). The study is a secondary data analysis on deidentified data and was therefore exempted from Institutional Review Board approval."}, {"section_title": "Geographic Classification", "text": "Geographical location was defined according the 2003 Rural-Urban Continuum Codes (RUCC) developed by the United States Department of Agriculture. 20 The codes are assigned to counties based on the population size of the Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), ranging from 1 to 9 (1 = counties in metro areas of 1 million population or more, 2 = counties in metro areas of 250,000 to 1 million population, 3 = counties in metro areas of fewer than 250,000 population, 4 = urban population of 20,000 or more, adjacent to a metro area, 5 = urban population of 20,000 or more, not adjacent to a metro area, 6 = urban population of 2,500-19,999, adjacent to a metro area, 7 = urban population of 2,500-19,999, not adjacent to a metro area, 8 = completely rural or less than 2,500 urban population, adjacent to a metro area, 9 = completely rural or less than 2,500 metro population, not adjacent to a metro area). A dichotomous variable was created, consistent with the Department of Agriculture's RUCC metro versus nonmetro delineation, in which codes 1-3 were coded as \"metropolitan\" and codes 4-9 were coded as \"nonmetropolitan.\" Of the 66 counties included, 31 counties were classified as nonmetro. "}, {"section_title": "Cigarette Use", "text": "Participants indicated if they had ever tried cigarette smoking, even a puff or two. Age of initiation for cigarette smoking was determined through the response to the survey question: \"How old were you when you smoked cigarettes for the first time?\" Response options ranged from \"8 or younger\" to \"17 years of age or older.\" Due to the distribution of the variable, a 3-level variable was created: age 8-11, age 12-14, and age 15-17. Participants indicated if they ever smoked daily (at least 1 cigarette a day for 30 days), how many days in the past 30 days they smoked (0, 1-2, 3-5, 6-9, 10-19, 20-29, and 30 days), and how many cigarettes they smoked per day on the days they smoked (0, less than 1, 2-5, 6-10, 11-20, and more than 20). Due to less variability among the higher number of cigarettes smoked per day, the last 2 categories (11-20 and more than 20) were combined for analysis. Participants also indicated how many cigarettes they have smoked in their lifetime (0; 1-2 puffs, not a whole cigarette; 1 cigarette; 2-20 cigarettes; 21-99 cigarettes; 100+ cigarettes). The following categories were combined into \u08d81 cigarette: 1-2 puffs, not a whole cigarette, and 1 cigarette.

Consistent with previous studies, adolescents from nonmetro areas were more likely to report having tried smoking cigarettes in their lifetime and smoking in the past 30 days. 11 The present findings, however, expand this research in 2 important ways. First, our findings show that adolescents from nonmetro areas tried smoking at earlier ages (as young as 8-11 years of age) than their metro counterparts. Delaying experimentation with cigarette smoking has been shown to be critical for reducing the likelihood of addiction and increasing the likelihood of quitting. [21] [22] [23] Thus, more interventions need to be implemented in nonmetro areas to prevent experimentation with and initiation of cigarette smoking. Second, the present findings suggest that adolescents from nonmetro areas are smoking heavier as adolescents than adolescents from metro areas. Adolescents in nonmetro areas were more likely to report smoking daily, having smoked more cigarettes in their lifetime, and smoking a greater number of cigarettes per day than adolescents in metro areas. Previous research suggests that approximately half of cigarette smokers will transition to daily smoking by age 18. 24 These data\nThe Journal of Rural Health 34 (2018) 80-87 c 2016 National Rural Health Association suggest that a greater proportion of nonmetro adolescents may transition to daily smoking at an earlier age than metro adolescents. Prevention efforts throughout adolescence, along with programs designed to help students quit, may be essential for addressing tobacco use in nonmetro areas. Importantly, this study found that nonmetro adolescents were more likely to report that the school had resources for students who wanted to quit. However, this was reported by less than one-quarter of all nonmetro adolescents. Evaluating the effects of inschool resources for quitting may be an avenue for future research.\nAnother primary contribution of this study was to examine how the tobacco-related environment, at multiple levels including friends, family, school, and community, may differ for metro and nonmetro adolescents. With regard to family and friends, differences were found between metro and nonmetro adolescents on all the factors examined including social norms (eg, friends' approval of adult smoking and parents offering them a cigarette) and exposure to smoking (eg, smoking allowed in the home, days in room with a smoker, and others smoking in the home). Due to the cross-sectional nature of this study, it is unclear if these factors led to differences observed in cigarette smoking in this study. However, these factors have been shown to be important contributors to adolescent smoking in previous studies. 25, 26 The differences found in this study indicate that focusing or including parents and adults in nonmetro communities in tobacco-related interventions may be important. Encouraging nonmetro parents to adopt a home smoking ban may be particularly beneficial. Future studies including longitudinal data are needed to examine how differences in the tobacco-related environment with regard to friends and family lead to differences in smoking behavior among metro and nonmetro adolescents.\nFinally, we found that important differences existed in the marketing of tobacco among metro and nonmetro adolescents, in which nonmetro adolescents were more likely to report seeing tobacco ads in common locations such as convenience stores, gas stations, grocery stores, and big box stores. It is possible that the differences observed can be attributed to differences in the types and number of outlets in metro and nonmetro areas. While these results should be interpreted with caution, previous research suggests that exposure to tobacco advertising and promotions foster positive attitudes toward smoking and increases the likelihood of initiation among adolescents. 27 It is possible that tobacco companies target nonmetro counties with their point-of-sale advertising. It is also possible that because there may be fewer retail stores in the nonmetro areas, the same amount of pointof-sale advertising becomes more visible. Nonetheless, point-of-sale advertising has been linked to adolescent tobacco use, and a recent review suggests that point-of-sale advertising may contribute to disparities in tobacco use. 28 It is notable that adolescents from nonmetro areas were less likely to see tobacco ads in drug stores or pharmacies. This may be because rural areas are more likely to have smaller independently owned pharmacies and drug stores that primarily sell health care needs and not tobacco.\nThis study has several limitations. First, it includes only adolescents from Florida. The results may not generalize to adolescents in other states in the United States. County-level data, however, are not available in many national datasets such as the National Youth Tobacco Survey. Second, a dichotomous measure of residential status was used: (1) metro and (2) nonmetro and rural combined. While this dichotomy is commonly used in health research, it is possible that there is variability in the nonmetro and rural category that was not captured in this study. Third, this study is cross-sectional and thus, causality cannot be established. Fourth, this study was limited to the questions included on the Florida Youth Tobacco Survey. Not all questions that might be important for understanding differences in tobacco use and the environment were included in the survey. Finally, the Florida Youth Tobacco Survey is a school-based survey and the results may not generalize to adolescents not in school. Finally, this study includes only youth who were in school. It is well known that rates of smoking are higher among youth who are not in school. Thus, the prevalence estimates of smoking presented in the current study may underestimate the true prevalence of smoking among each group. It is unclear, based on current research, whether this underestimate would be similar or different for metro and nonmetro adolescents. Despite these limitations, this study includes a large, diverse, representative sample from a large state in the United States. This study provides a more in-depth examination (versus previous studies) of how both tobacco use and the tobacco-related environment differ among adolescents living in metro and nonmetro areas. Future research should examine how differences in the tobacco environment are associated with observed differences in cigarette use."}]
