Approach and Results-A systematic search of Pubmed (1966Pubmed ( to 2014, EMBASE (1947EMBASE ( to 2014, MEDLINE (1946MEDLINE ( to 2014, and the Cochrane Library (1951 to 2014) was conducted and the reference lists of identified articles were searched to find intervention trials (randomized/nonrandomized) that aimed to achieve weight loss and included PWV as an outcome. The search was restricted to human studies. Two independent researchers extracted the data. Data were analyzed using Comprehensive Meta Analysis version 2 using random effects analysis. A total of 22 studies were included in the qualitative synthesis and 20 studies (3 randomized controlled trials), involving 1259 participants, were included in the meta-analysis. The standardized mean difference for the overall effect of weight loss on PWV measured at all sites was \u22120.32 (95% confidence interval, \u22120.41, \u22120.24; P=0.0001). Carotid femoral pulse wave velocity (standardized mean difference, \u22120.35; 95% confidence interval, \u22120.44, \u22120.26; P=0.0001; 16 studies) and brachial ankle PWV (standardized mean difference, \u22120.48; 95% confidence interval, \u22120.78, \u22120.18; P=0.002; 5 studies) were improved with weight loss. Meta-regression showed that change in blood pressure was a predictor of change in PWV (P<0.01).\nweight loss (mean 8% of initial body weight) achieved with diet and lifestyle measures improved PWV. The results of this meta-analysis suggest that weight loss may reduce PWV, although future research is required. (Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol. 2015;35:243-252.

The Trial of Nonpharmacological Interventions in the Elderly enrolled subjects >60 years with hypertension to investigate the effect of weight loss on blood pressure and cardiovascular outcomes. 3 After a median follow-up of 29 months, the hazard ratio (HR) for a cardiovascular end point or diagnosis of high blood pressure in the weight reduction group was 0.64 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.49, 0.85; P=0.002). 4 More recently, the Look AHEAD trial (n=5145) failed to show a benefit of weight reduction on cardiovascular end points in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus after a median followup of 9.6 years. 5 In the Look AHEAD trial, the mean weight loss in the intervention group was 6%, compared with 3.5% in the control group.\nCarotid femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) is considered the gold standard method for measuring arterial stiffness because it measures the propagation of the forward pressure at the level of the aorta. 6 A meta-analysis of individual participant data from 17 studies (17 635 participants) showed that cfPWV was an independent predictor of coronary heart disease (HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.11 to 1.35), stroke (HR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.16 to 1.42), CVD (HR, 1.30; 1.18 to 1.43), CVD mortality (HR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.15 to 1.43), and all-cause mortality (HR, 1.17; 1.11 to 1.22), after adjustment for established risk factors. Furthermore, the addition of cfPWV to conventional Framingham risk factors improved 10-year CVD risk prediction by 13% in those at intermediate risk of CVD. 7 Many studies indicate that weight loss may improve pulse wave velocity (PWV), although in about half of the studies the change is not statistically significant. A meta-analysis has not been conducted to assess the overall effect of weight loss. The primary aim of this meta-analysis of intervention trials is to determine the effect of weight loss, achieved by an energy restricted diet with or without exercise, antiobesity drugs or bariatric surgery on PWV measured at all arterial segments in adults."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": "Materials and Methods are available in the online-only Data Supplement."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Studies", "text": "The search strategy identified 7713 publications and 6119 were excluded based on the title and the abstract, and a further 403 were excluded after full text assessment (online-only Data Supplement).

Five studies 17, 18, 20, 21, 28 only included men or women and therefore are only somewhat representative of the population they were drawn from. 31 Only 3 studies 9,12,24 were randomized controlled trials and the control groups were drawn from the same population because the intervention group and the baseline characteristics of the groups were comparable.

Weight loss (mean 8% of initial body weight) significantly improved PWV (SMD, \u22120.32; 95% CI, \u22120.41, \u22120.24; P=0.0001; Q=35; P=0.11; I 2 =26%; Figure 1 ). Sensitivity analysis showed that no 1 study was responsible for the observed effect and significance was maintained after the removal of each individual study. Examination of the funnel plot showed evidence of publication bias (Eggers test P=0.08l; Figure 2 ). There were 10 studies that used an energy restricted diet to achieve weight loss and 8 studies that had a diet and exercise intervention. Both types of weight loss interventions were associated with a significant reduction in PWV and the effect was nonsignificantly larger (Q=0.19; P=0.66) for weight loss achieved with an energy restricted diet (SMD, -0.36; 95% CI, \u22120.47, \u22120.25; P=0.0001; Q=15; P=0.38; I 2 =7; mean weight loss 8% of initial body weight) compared with energy restriction plus exercise (SMD, \u22120.32; 95% CI, \u22120.49, \u22120.15; P=0.0001; Q=14; P=0.045; I 2 =51%; mean weight loss 8% of initial body weight). There was a nonsignificantly (Q=2; P=0.17) larger effect on PWV when >10% of initial body weight was lost (SMD, \u22120.44; 95% CI, \u22120.63, \u22120.25; P=0.0001; Q=7; P=0.29; I 2 =19%) compared with <10% of initial body weight (SMD, \u22120.29; 95% CI, \u22120.38, \u22120.20; P=0.001; Q= 24; P=0.18; I 2 =22%).\nWhen the different types of PWV measurements were looked at, there was no statistically significant difference in the response to weight loss (Q=8; P=0.11 studies) were significantly reduced by weight loss. Carotid radial, aortic, and femoral ankle PWV were not significantly reduced by weight loss (Figure 3 ).

Weight loss (kg), baseline weight, intervention period, and percentage weight loss did not correlate with the change in PWV ( online-only Data Supplement).

Carotid femoral PWV and brachial ankle pulse wave velocity, robust indirect measures of arterial stiffness that are predictive of cardiovascular events and mortality, 7, 32 were improved with weight loss. In addition, meta-regression showed that the change in systolic and diastolic blood pressure was correlated with the change in PWV. To the authors knowledge, this is the first systematic review and meta-analysis to be conducted on the topic. A previous meta-analysis of the effect of bariatric surgery on cardiovascular risk factors and measures of cardiac structure and function showed that the Framingham Risk Score was reduced and left ventricular ejection fraction and left ventricular mass were improved after bariatric surgery. 33 The weighted mean excessive weight loss was 54% in the meta-analysis by Vest et al. 33 PWV was not included in this meta-analysis. The results of the current meta-analysis show that an improvement in PWV can be seen with more modest weight loss (8%), which can be achieved with diet and lifestyle measures.\nIn this meta-analysis, weight loss of >10% of initial body weight was associated with an improvement in cfPWV of \u22480.8 m/s. A previous meta-analysis of longitudinal studies, with a mean follow-up time of 7.7 years, showed that with a 1 m/s lower cfPWV the risk of a cardiovascular event was reduced by 14%. 34 Furthermore, a recent meta-analysis showed that arterial stiffness was improved with antioxidant supplementation (SMD, \u22120.17; 95% CI, \u22120.26, \u22120.08; P<0.001) 35 and Pase et al 36 showed that omega 3 supplementation (SMD Hedges g, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.11, 0.56; P=0.044) reduced PWV. In both of these meta-analyses, the effect sizes were similar to what we observed with weight loss (SMD \u22120.32). These findings together suggest that weight loss may be an effective way to improve vascular health but this needs to be confirmed by a well-designed placebo-controlled randomized trial.\nMeta-regression showed that the change in systolic and diastolic blood pressure was correlated with the change in PWV. A systematic review of observational studies showed that blood pressure was an independent predictor of PWV in 90% of published studies involving the 2 outcomes. 37 The results of the meta-regression showed that the change in blood pressure was correlated with the change in PWV, although the direction of the causality cannot be established. Many epidemiological studies have shown a positive association between body mass index and PWV, independent of age and blood pressure, which becomes evident as early as childhood. [38] [39] [40] It was shown by Weisbrod et al 41 that when mice were fed a high fat, high sucrose diet that significantly increased their body weight, PWV was increased by 2.4-fold after 1 month, compared with a normal diet. An increase in systolic blood pressure was not observed until 6 months and diastolic blood pressure remained unchanged. This study concluded that arterial stiffness preceded hypertension. 41 An analysis from the Framingham Offspring Study supported this finding as it was found that blood pressure measured between 1998 and 2001 did not predict PWV measured between 2005 and 2008. 42 PWV has been found to predict systolic blood pressure in both the Framingham Offspring Study and the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. 42, 43 These studies together suggest that the reduction in PWV caused by the weight loss may reduce the risk of systolic hypertension.\nThe reduction in PWV seen with weight loss may also be explained by a reduction in vascular remodelling and inflammatory molecules. In the study by Weisbrod et al, 41 after 2 months of hypercaloric feeding the greatest increase in PWV was observed and this was accompanied by a reduction in endothelial nitric oxide function. In addition, activity of tissue transglutaminase-2 enzyme, which increases extracellular matrix cross-linking, was increased. When the mice were put back onto a normal diet they lost 12.5% of body weight (returned to control weight) within 2 weeks and PWV was reduced to control measurements within 2 months. 41 After diet reversal inflammatory gene expression was normalized and a reduction in extracellular matrix cross-links were observed. A study of healthy adults showed that metalloproteinase-9 and serum elastase activity were positively associated with PWV, indicating a role for elastin changes in arterial stiffening. 44 This suggests that obesity causes arterial stiffening as a result of an increase in inflammation and vascular remodelling molecules and a change in endothelial function.\nLimitations of this analysis include the low quality of the included studies because only 3 studies were randomized controlled trials and the methods of randomization and blinding were not reported. In addition, there was evidence of publication bias. Therefore, the evidence provided by this meta-analysis is of a low quality and can only be interpreted as hypothesis generating. A subgroup analysis for dietary composition was unable to be performed because the macro-nutrient composition was not reported in many articles.\nIn this meta-analysis of 20 studies, including data from 1259 participants, it was shown that when modest weight loss (8% of initial body weight) was achieved, PWV was reduced (SMD, \u22120.32; 95% CI, \u22120.41, \u22120.24; P=0.0001). In addition, the change in PWV was correlated with the change in systolic and diastolic blood pressure. However, because of the low methodological quality of the included studies, well-designed randomized controlled trials are required to confirm this finding. The results of this meta-analysis suggest that weight loss may improve PWV, although future research is required."}]
