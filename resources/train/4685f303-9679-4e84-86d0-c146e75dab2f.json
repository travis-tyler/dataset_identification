Among these phases, the most critical stage for early diagnosis and monitoring is the preclinical phase in which individuals are cognitively normal but have had pathological changes. These pathological changes can be reflected by some biomarkers, such as cerebrospinal fluid A\u03b2 (CSF A\u03b2), cerebrospinal fluid total tau protein (CSF t-tau), cerebrospinal fluid phosphorylated tau protein (CSF p-tau), F18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron AGING emission tomography (FDG-PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, none of these biomarkers is suited to track disease progression, because of their invasiveness or high expenses. Therefore, many studies focused on blood biomarkers, such as plasma neurofilament light (NFL).\nThe NFL is a component of the axonal cytoskeleton and a putative marker of large-caliber axonal degeneration which is an important pathological change in neurodegeneration diseases [7] . Advancements in measurements of NFL have revealed the abnormal increase in the progression of AD, even in early stages. As for familial AD, a recent study has found important predictive roles of serous NFL in disease progression and brain neurodegeneration at the preclinical phase [8] . However, whether blood NFL has the same predictive roles in sporadic AD is still unclear. Another recent study focusing on cognitively normal (CN) individuals has found that elevated levels of CSF NFL but not CSF tTau, pTau or neurogranin (Ng) were a risk factor for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) [9] . Moreover, advancements in measurements of NFL have revealed strong correlations between CSF NFL and blood NFL, which has sparked interests in roles of blood NFL on sporadic AD [10] . Therefore, we speculated that, as for sporadic AD, plasma NFL also had some predictive roles in neurodegeneration or progression of disease in the preclinical phase. This study focused on CN individuals to test the hypothesis that the plasma NFL concentration and its rate of change are abnormally elevated in the preclinical phase of AD and they correlate with impaired cognition, neuroimaging abnormalities and CSF biomarkers of AD."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Sample characteristics", "text": "The demographics of the study population were listed in Table 1 . No statistical difference was found between CNgroup (healthy control group: cognitively normal participants without significant A\u03b2-related pathological changes) and CN+ group (preclinical group: cognitively normal participants with significant A\u03b2-related pathological changes) in age (p = 0.0510), sex (p = 0.0679) and education (p = 0.1005). The prevalence of an APOE\u03b54 in CN+ group was higher than that in CNgroup. Plasma NFL correlated with age (\u03c1 = 0.47, p < 0.01), but not with sex (median, 30.9 pg/ml for male vs 31.7 pg/ml for female, p = 0.44), education (\u03c1 = 0.01, p = 0.87) or APOE\u03b54 genotype (median, 30.6 pg/ml for carriers vs 31.8 pg/ml for noncarriers, p = 0.60). As for CSF biomarkers, the levels of A\u03b242, tTau and p-tau181 were much higher in CN+ group (A\u03b242: p < 0.0001; t-tau: p = 0.0002; p-tau181: p < 0.0001) compared with the CN-group. However, the cognitive level (ADNI_MEM: p = 0.1052), FDG-PET (p = 0.1525) and hippocampus volume (p = 0.0734) showed no significant differences between the two groups. It is worth noting that both plasma NFL concentration and its rate of change were higher in the CN+ group (NFL concentration: p = 0.0044; Rate of change: p < 0.0001) (Table 1, Figure 1 ). However, the two groups showed a high degree of overlap in the range of plasma NFL concentration as well as that of its change rate (Table 1, Figure 1 ).

Associations between baseline biomarkers (plasma NFL concentrations, rate of change in plasma NFL, CSF A\u03b242, CSF t-tau, CSF p-tau181 and FDG-PET) and longitudinal data (ADNI_MEM, ADNI_EF and hippocampus volume) were tested by LMEMs corrected for age, sex, education and APOE genotype.\nneuroimaging abnormalities, especially for the preclinical AD individuals (4) rate of change in plasma NFL showed predictive effects on neither of impaired cognition and neuroimaging abnormalities among CN individuals.\nThe higher level of baseline plasma NFL concentrations in CN+ group indicated that plasma NFL concentrations have already been abnormally high in the preclinical phase of AD. This result contradicted a previous study which did not find statistical differences in plasma NFL concentration between CN+ and CN-groups [10] . It is worth noting that our study included a larger cognitively normal cohort with more stringent quality control and excluded extremes (limit: mean\u00b13SD). Moreover, to avoid misclassifying some preclinical AD patients in the category of the normal group, we divided participants into A\u03b2 positive or negative (A+/A-) patients according CSF A\u03b2 or AV45-PET SUVR.\nTherefore, data quality in our study was higher than that in the previous study. Three CSF biomarkers (A\u03b242, ttau, p-tau181) all significantly increased in CN+ group, whereas baseline cognitive level (especially ADNI_MEM), hippocampus volume and FDG-PET showed no obvious differences compared with the CNgroup. These results were consistent with previous assumptions. A widely accepted assumption was that biomarkers have already been abnormal in the preclinical phase without significant cognitive decline. Among these biomarkers, some core biomarkers (especially A\u03b2 and tau protein) became abnormal earlier than other markers (such as MRI and FDG-PET) [11] . AGING However, though our results showed that plasma NFL concentration was already abnormally high in the preclinical AD phase, we could see that range of plasma NFL concentration in the two groups had considerable overlap, indicating that, unlike A\u03b2, plasma NFL may not be suitable as an early diagnostic marker.\nConsistent with previous studies, our study found a cross-sectional association between plasma NFL and CSF t-tau. Previous studies showed that both CSF tau and plasma NFL, as indicators of neuronal injury, may reflect the degree of neurodegenerative changes [12] [13] [14] . It is worth noting that results also showed an association between plasma NFL and CSF A\u03b242. An association between plasma NFL and CSF A\u03b242 was found in total participants by the cross-sectional association test. Moreover, longitudinal results also showed associations between estimated annual rate of change in plasma NFL and estimated annual rate of change in CSF A\u03b242 for total participants and CN+ participants, but not for CN-participants. These results contradicted previous studies which did not find associations between plasma NFL and CSF A\u03b242 [10] . We thought the main reason for these contradictory results was that our study focused on the cognitively normal population. Previous studies indicated that A\u03b2plaque accumulation in individuals destined to become dementia might begin two decades before the clinical symptoms [15] . Thus in the CN phase, not all individuals' CSF A\u03b242 had reached the plateau stage and the changes of CSF A\u03b242 were still reflected by plasma NFL. According to the above results, we could see that plasma NFL was already abnormally high in the preclinical phase of AD and was associated with some early core AD-related biomarkers (CSF A\u03b242 and tau protein).\nIn order to explore the utility of plasma NFL as a predictor of subsequent neurodegeneration and clinical symptoms and to compare predictive roles of plasma NFL with those of some other biomarkers, we used a (retrospective) pseudo-predictive analysis. The results showed that baseline plasma NFL could predict future annualized changes of hippocampal atrophy and annualized changes of ADNI_MEM especially for CN+ participants. Compared with plasma NFL, CSF p-tau181 played predictive roles only in cognitive decline for CN+ participants and CSF t-tau play predictive roles only in hippocampal atrophy for CN+ participants. According to previous studies, earliest cognitive symptoms in AD were characterized by typical deficits in episodic memory (ADNI-MEM) rather than executive functioning (ADNI-EF) [11] . Previous autopsy data confirmed that cerebral atrophy was one of the neurodegenerative biomarkers which indicated dendritic pruning as well as loss of synapses and neurons [16] . Some studies implied that cerebral atrophy (especially hippocampal volume) was the most proximate pathological substrate of cognitive impairment in AD [17] [18] [19] . Overall, these results"}, {"section_title": "Figure 2. Prediction of changes in hippocampus volume and cognition by baseline plasma NFL. Associations between baseline", "text": "plasma NFL concentrations or rate of change in plasma NFL and longitudinal data were tested by LMEMs corrected for age, sex, education and APOE genotype. (A) In CN+ group, higher baseline plasma NFL levels were significantly associated with an increased rate of change in hippocampus volume (\u03b2 = -0.0351, p = 0.0088). This association did not exist in CN-group (\u03b2 = -0.0007, p = 0.9311). (B) Results did not show association between baseline plasma NFL levels and ADNI_EF (CN-: \u03b2 = -0.0076, p = 0.5975; CN+: \u03b2 = -0.0135, p = 0.5070).

This association did not exist in CN-group (\u03b2 = -0.0009, p = 0.9313).\nAGING indicated that, even in the preclinical phase of AD, plasma NFL still played predictive roles not only in cerebral structural changes but also in cognitive impairment. Therefore, though plasma NFL may not be suitable as an early diagnostic marker, it may be suitable as an early neurodegenerative biomarker in preclinical AD.\nBlood-based biomarkers have obvious advantages in monitoring disease progression. Several previous studies have tested some blood-based biomarkers. However, there was heterogeneity in the results. As for plasma tau protein, a study found associations between increased plasma tau protein and AD hallmarks, but these associations were mild and they varied with cohorts [20] . Though a comprehensive meta-analysis of blood markers showed total tau protein was useful in differentiating participants with established AD from healthy controls yet with some overlaps, no evidence showed that it was useful in detection of earlier disease [21] . As for plasma A\u03b2, previous studies also failed to obtain consistent results to prove its ability to diagnose of AD [21] . Moreover, A\u03b2-related biomarkers may not track progression unless in very early stage of disease because A\u03b2-related pathology is an early event in AD and it may reach the plateau before symptom onset. Therefore, the above blood-based biomarkers seemed not to be suitable as early biomarkers in preclinical AD and our results may provide a new candidate.\nA few limitations in our study should be noted. Firstly, we had some missing data in our longitudinal data, especially at later follow-up time points, which had a slight impact on the results. Secondly, the sample size in our study was comparatively small and these results should be further tested in a larger population. Thirdly, increased plasma NFL concentrations were also found in some other neurodegenerative diseases, such as frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), indicating a lack of specificity of plasma NFL [22, 23] . Though this limitation does not negate its role as a general biomarker for neurodegeneration, more studies involving a variety of neurodegenerative diseases are warranted to investigate the roles of plasma NFL.\nTaken together, our findings suggested that plasma NFL concentrations and rate of change in plasma NFL were already abnormally high in the preclinical AD phase. Plasma NFL was associated with some core AD-related biomarkers, cognitive decline and cerebral atrophy, especially for the preclinical AD individuals. Therefore, plasma NFL may be a valuable noninvasive tool to assess neurodegeneration and to predict preclinical AD individuals' longitudinal disease progression. However, the predictive roles of rate of change in plasma NFL were limited in the preclinical phase of sporadic AD."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "ADNI database", "text": "Data used in this study were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (http://adni.loni.usc.edu).
