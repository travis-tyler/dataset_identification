[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus integrity for up to 16 hours in laboratory-created respirable-sized aerosols. Nevertheless, finding virus RNA in material collected by an air sampler may not correlate with risk. Indeed, the air we breathe is full of viruses (animal, plant, bacterial, human, etc.), yet a large proportion of the viruses in air are non-viable due to UV-inactivation, drying, etc., and non-viable viruses cannot cause illnesses. Because efforts to isolate virus in cell cultures in the aforementioned air sampling studies in hospital wards were not made (Guo et al., 2020; Chia et al., 2020) , or failed when they were attempted due to overgrowth by faster J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f replicating respiratory viruses (Lednicky et al., 2020) , and so far only one has provided evidence of virus isolation (Santarpia et al., 2020) , uncertainties about the role of aerosols in COVID-19 transmission remain.\nIt is well known that virus particles collected by various air samplers become inactivated during the air sampling process (Pan et al., 2019) , and if such is the case for SARS-CoV-2, this partly explains why it has been difficult to prove that SARS-CoV-2 collected from aerosols is viable. Because we previously collected SARS-CoV-2 from the air of a respiratory illness ward within a clinic but were unable to isolate the virus in cell cultures due to out-competition by other respiratory viruses (Lednicky et al., 2020) , we sought to perform air sampling tests in a hospital room reserved for COVID-19 patients, to lessen the probability of collecting other airborne human respiratory viruses. We thus collected aerosols containing SARS-CoV-2 in a room housing COVID-19 patients using our VIVAS air samplers that collect virus particles without damaging them, thus conserving their viability. These samplers operate using a water- "}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "Additional details are provided in the Supplementary file that accompanies this article.

On admission, a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab from the patient was rRT-J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA (Cq = 32). Patient 2 had been admitted four days before the air sampling tests with a mid-brain stroke; the patient had a positive NP swab test for SARS-CoV-2 on admission, but a repeat test was negative, and the patient was in the process of being discharged at the time the air sampling was being done. Both patients provided written consent for this study."}, {"section_title": "Hospital room", "text": "Air samples were collected in a room that was part of a designated COVID-19 ward (Figure 1 ). The room had six air changes per hour and the exhaust air underwent triple filter treatment (minimum efficiency reporting value [MERV] 14, 75%-85% efficiency for 0.3 \u00b5m particles), coil condensation (to remove moisture), and UV-C irradiation prior to recycling 90% of the treated air back to the room."}, {"section_title": "Air samplers and sampling parameters", "text": "Three serial 3-hr air samplings were performed using our prototype VIVAS air sampler ( Table 1 that detect a section of the SARS-CoV-2 N-gene (Lednicky et al., 2020) .

Lednicky and does not detect common human alpha-or beta-coronaviruses.

Sequencing Whereas the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 genome equivalents per liter of air were estimated ( Table   2 ), determination of the specific infectivity (ratio of SARS-CoV-2 genome equivalents present for every one able to infect a cell in culture) required performance of a plaque assay or a standard 50% endpoint dilution assay (TCID50 assay). Plaque assays could not be performed due to a nationwide non-availability of some critical media components (due to COVID-19 pandemic-related temporary lockdown of production facilities), so TCID50 assays were performed in Vero E6 cells to estimate the percentage of the collected virus particles that were viable. Estimates ranged from 2 to 74 TCID50 units/L of air (Table 4) ."}, {"section_title": "SARS-CoV", "text": "A nearly complete SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence was obtained by next-generation sequencing (NGS) of RNA purified from cell culture medium of Vero E6 cells 7 dpi with NP swab material from patient 1.\nThe RNA that was used for NGS had an rRT-PCR Cq value of 14 when tested using the SARS-CoV-2 Ngene primers described in Table 1 . The nearly complete genome sequence (and the virus isolate) were designated SARS-CoV-2/human/UF-19/2020, and this genome sequence has been deposited in GenBank (accession no. MT668716) and in GISAID (accession no. EPI_ISL_480349). Because the amount of virus RNA was below the threshold that could be easily sequenced by our NGS methods, Sanger sequencing was used to sequence SARS-CoV-2 RNA directly purified from the collection media of air samplers 1-1, 1-3, 2-1, and 2-3. One complete SARS-CoV-2 sequence was attained for RNA purified in the material collected by air sampling 1-1, and three nearly complete sequences for 1-3, 2-1, and 2-3, respectively.

In other reports, attempts to isolate the virus were not successful. The current study takes advantage of a newer air sampling technology that operates using a water-vapor condensation mechanism, facilitating the likelihood of isolating the virus in tissue culture.
