Recently, the 3Dstructure was determined for the SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike protein 13 and RBD of the spike protein in complex with ACE2 receptor. 4 Sequence and structural comparisons of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 strains indicate high similarity between these strains. The domain B (S B ) of the spike protein of these two strains, which contains ACE2 receptor-binding site, shows 75% sequence identity. 14 However, the SARS-CoV spike protein binding antibodies S230, m396, and 80R do not bind to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein despite such high similarities. 13 In this work, we performed a comparative analysis of spike protein structures from NL63, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, focusing on the receptor-binding domains to aid drug design and provide explanations for the observed differences and similarities. The study concentrates on three main aspects: sequence/structure conservation, hydrophobic clustering behavior and affinity change upon mutations in binding domains to bring out reasons for varying severity, transmission rate and longevity among ACE2 binding coronavirus strains. It is observed that the NL63 spike protein does not show much sequence or structure conservation with SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2, although there are conserved residues in the binding interface of the spike proteins of all three strains. Also, the interaction energies indicate that any mutation on these residues could reduce the binding affinity of the ACE2 bound complex. Moreover, the conserved Gly residue in the binding interface remains essential for ACE2 binding and had low surrounding hydrophobicity in all three strains. The analysis of interface residues in the RBD regions shows that the surrounding hydrophobicity of the interface is very high for the severe SARS-CoV strain of coronavirus."}, {"section_title": "| Sequence and structures", "text": "A simple search query \"coronavirus\" in the PDB database 15 generates result page with more than 800 structures, which includes all sorts of structural information such as proteins/protein fragments, protein complexes with natural ligands, therapeutics or neutralizing agents related to coronaviruses. Currently, six human coronavirus strains (three mild and three severe strains) have 3D structures available in the PDB database for the spike protein receptor-binding domains (RBDs) ( Table 1) . We have selected all the three ACE-2 binding coronavirus strains, one mild (NL63) and two severe (SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) in the current analysis.

The PDB files were then rectified using the \"RepairPDB\" command in FoldX. The residues present at the interface of spike protein and ACE2 protein were mutated systematically using \"BuildModel\"\ncommand, and the interaction energy between the proteins was calculated using \"AnalyseComplex\" command. The change in interaction energy (\u0394IE) was further calculated using following equation:\nwhere IE mutant is interaction energy of the complex with point mutation and IE wild-type is the interaction energy of wild-type complex. Similarly, we computed the change in stability upon mutation using Figure 2B , which clearly shows that binding interface gets it. 26 The experimental studies have shown that the binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 is higher than SARS-CoV strain with ACE2 receptor. 4 We further calculated the interface surface area of the spike protein-ACE2 complexes. NL63 spike protein shared the least surface area (1190 \u00c5 2 ), as previously reported. 11 SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 had higher surface areas of 1816 \u00c5 2 and 1861 \u00c5 2 , respectively.

Interface residues are highlighted in the alignment residues based on (1) occupancy of the same residue in a particular position in all the three spike proteins in multiple sequence alignment and (2) the interacting residues (same amino acid residue and residues with similar physicochemical characteristics, respectively) between spike proteins and ACE2. The identified conserved and semiconserved residues are highlighted in Table 2 . The conserved Gly residue in all three strains (G537 in NL63, G488 in SARS-CoV and G502\nin SARS-CoV-2) has the same contacts (Lys353 and Gly354) in ACE2.\nThe semi-conserved residues have similar physicochemical characteristics. The semi-conserved residue, Tyr (Y498 in NL63, Y436 in SARS-CoV and Tyr449 in SARS-CoV-2) shows a common binding to a negatively charged residue in ACE2 (E37 or D38).\nFurther, the aromatic residues, Tyr (Tyr491 in SARS-CoV and Tyr505 in SARS-CoV-2 strains) or Trp585 (in NL63) present in the close proximity of conserved Gly residue, also form common contacts with Gly354 in ACE2. However, Trp585 residue in NL63 spike protein is a distant residue in sequence (48 residues father in NL63 compared to three residues farther in SARS strains, in the C-terminal side relative to conserved Gly residue) ( Figure S1 ). The conserved and semi-conserved residues in the spike proteins are highlighted in Table 2 .\nThe conserved residues identified in the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are compared to other \u03b2-coronaviruses (HKU1, OC43, and MERS-CoV) using multiple sequence alignment to identify the mutations. We noticed that MERS-CoV misses the ACE2 binding region ( Figure S2 ), which might induce MERS-CoV spike protein to bind with a different receptor, DPP4. 29 The HKU1 and OC43 spike proteins have Tyr449 residue mutated to Trp and Tyr505 residue mutated to\nThr when compared to the SARS-CoV-2 strain. These mutations are not observed in the ACE2 binding coronavirus strains. Although OC43 strain has conserved Gly residue present, its host receptor remains unknown. The HKU1 spike protein also lacks the conserved Gly residue, which explains its binding to a different receptor, HLA class I antigen ( Figure S2 ). Figure S3 . We further analyzed the residue-wise surrounding hydrophobicity of the RBD region and compared the free spike protein binding interface and ACE2 bound spike protein interface. hydrophobicity (8 kcal/mol) in the bound form. A similar trend is observed with Gly488 in SARS-CoV (6.2 kcal/mol), whose counterpart Gly502 in SARS-CoV-2 has lower surrounding hydrophobicity (4.9 kcal/mol; Table S1 ). In conclusion, SARS-CoV-2 has lower surrounding hydrophobicity compared to SARS-CoV strain in the binding interface. The higher hydrophobic environment at the interface for SARS-CoV strains can improve its binding to ACE2. 31 "}, {"section_title": "| Comparison of conserved/semi-conserved binding interface residues", "text": "The conserved residues Tyr498 and Trp585 in NL63 have relatively more surrounding hydrophobicity in both free protein and in complex with ACE2 (Table S2 ).

The analysis of changes in interaction energy upon point mutation showed that most of the residues in the interface reduce the binding affinity the complex upon mutation, which indicates their importance for binding. However, change in interaction energy was relatively higher for Ser535, Gly537, and Ser540 residues in NL63; Tyr487, and Gly488 in SARS-CoV; Leu455, Ala475, Asn487, Gly496 and Gly502 residues in SARS-CoV-2 (Table 3 ). The conserved Gly residue significantly reduced the binding affinity in all three strains (maximum change in interaction energy of 19.6, 15.92 and 14.45 kcal/mol for NL63, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, respectively). The stability analysis using FoldX and CUPSAT also revealed that the mutation of conserved Gly destabilizes the protein (Tables S3 and S4) , showing its importance for both stabilizing and interacting with ACE2."}, {"section_title": "| CONCLUSIONS", "text": "The severity of a disease can be attributed to the sequence or structure features of the involved host-pathogen proteins. Here, we have analyzed the relationship between the severity of coronavirus strains and the inherent structural and sequence features of the spike protein. The least interaction area, surrounding hydrophobicity and interaction energy for the interface residues are the main reasons for the mild severity of human coronavirus NL63. SARS-COV is more severe than SARS-COV-2 mainly due to similar size of the interface area, but absence of flexible residues (flexible residues can increase the entropic cost to binding), highest hydrophobic environment at the interface for better interaction with ACE2 and highest interaction energy. The wet lab studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 has a better binding affinity than SARS-CoV. 4 However, an experimental study on 200 neutralizing antibodies obtained from convalescent patients has also concluded that binding affinity does not necessarily correlate with effective neutralization. 34 Our study has also identified con- "}]
