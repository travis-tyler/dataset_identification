[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae in the family of Coronaviridae. In this family, there are four types of viruses: \u03b1-coronavirus, \u03b2-coronavirus, \u03b3-coronavirus, \u03b4-coronavirus (Banerjee et al. 2019; Yang and Leibowitz 2015) . The CoV genome is an enveloped, positive-sense, and single-stranded RNA whose size is 26-32 kb and it has the largest genome of known RNA viruses. It is known that \u03b1and \u03b2-CoV types cause infections in mammals as \u03b4and \u03b3-CoVs infect birds (Banerjee et al. 2019; Yang and Leibowitz 2015; Schoeman and Fielding 2019) . Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) belonging to \u03b2-CoVs are the most well-known aggressive strains of coronaviruses and cause viral pneumonia outbreaks, recently. SARS first appeared in China in 2002, spread and resulted in 8437 cases and 813 deaths with an 11% mortality rate according to the World Health Organization (WHO) reports (Song et al. 2019; Graham et al. 2013; Zhong et al. 2003) . MERS, which emerged in Saudi Arabia in 2012 firstly, caused 2206 patients in 27 countries, 1831 cases in Saudi Arabia with 787 deaths with the mortality rate of 37% between June 2012 and April 2018 (Zumla et al. 2015; Hui et al. 2018; Su et al. 2015; Nassar et al. 2018) .\nIn December 2019, some people had sickness with unknown etiology in Wuhan City where 11 million residents live, Hubei Province in China. This sickness was a kind of pneumonia and the sequence analysis revealed that the cause of it was a novel CoV whose genome structure was more than 82% identical to those of SARS-CoV, following this phenomenon was named as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) Wong et al. 2020; Chan et al. 2020) . Unfortunately, case numbers are increasing continuously day by day, the COVID-19 disease has spread primarily to China, the Islamic Republic of Iran, and Europe. It was determined that the COVID-19 disease had human-to-human transmission ability by the National Health Commission of China on 20 January 2020. COVID-19 outbreak a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) on 30 January 2020.\nBeginning in March 2020, COVID-19 has spread in 72 countries quickly, caused over 90,000 confirmed cases and 2946 deaths . As this outbreak turned into a global threat, the WHO announced that the COVID-19 outbreak could be characterized as a global pandemic, on 12 March 2020 (The World Health Organization Regional Office for Europe. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak news). 22,256,220 cases and 782,456 deaths caused by the COVID-19 pandemic according to the WHO records on 21 August 2020 (The World Health Organization Home. Coronavirus disease 2019 current case numbers).\nCurrently, the man has no registered specific vaccines or therapy methods for COVID-19 accepted by the whole world. WHO stated that there were nine vaccine candidates against COVID-19 in the advanced stages of clinical trials (timesnownews.com). Russia government announced the world's first COVID-19 vaccine called as Sputnik V (Table 1) was developed by the Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology on 12 August (sciencemag.org/news), but WHO declared that there is not enough information about Sputnik V and they are in contact with Russia (timesnownews.com). That's why, there is an urgent need to find drugs or vaccines which can be used in the treatment of COVID-19 infections, effectively. Nevertheless, there are some reports and data from studies related to the use of known drugs like chloroquine and remdesivir that have proved efficacy on COVID-19 pneumonia both in vitro and in animal models. In this context, we summarize therapeutic options available for the treatment of COVID-19."}, {"section_title": "Therapy", "text": "The pharmaceutical interventions available for COVID-19 therapy can be divided into several groups: immunotherapy, cellular therapy, antiviral and other drugs, and Chinese medicine."}, {"section_title": "Immunoglobulins", "text": "Immunoglobulins are used to treat for various diseases, for example, Guillain-Barre Syndrome, Kawasaki disease as well as some pathologic conditions such as idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (Cherin et al. 2016) . Various glycoproteins on virus surfaces or the protein shell of a non-enveloped virus could be recognized by extensively neutralizing antibodies, but HIV-1 (human immunodeficiency virus), dengue virus, hepatitis C, Ebola virus, and influenza viruses can mutate superficial glycoproteins, thus they avoid the antibody response. This condition creates an obstacle to develop new therapies for such infections (Srinivasan et al. 2016) . Although intravenous gammaglobulin has adverse reactions, it is probably the safest immunomodulating drug. Intravenous gammaglobulin has been used extensively for patients with SARS in Singapore, but venous thromboembolism including pulmonary embolism has emerged in one-third of critically ill patients (Lew et al. 2003 "}, {"section_title": "Interferons", "text": "Interferons (IFNs) are substances having protein structure that bind to receptors on cellular surfaces and initiate JAK-STAT signaling cascades (Schneider et al. 2014 ). IFNs are considered as two types: Type I and Type II IFNs. Type I IFNs, which make up of two different proteins: IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 are inclusive of natural immunity against viral infections. Type I IFN release forms are the first line of defense against infections caused by viruses. In the 7th published National Health Council (NHC) guideline, IFN-\u03b1 single or in combination with other drugs are indicated in the clinical usages (Chinese Clinical Guidance for COVID-19 Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment (7th edition)). IFN\u03b1 included in Type I IFNs is grown very rapidly as part of the congenital immune response to infections caused by viruses and inhibits the transcription of animal and human coronaviruses (Mathias et al. 2010; ClinicalTrials.gov [Internet] 2020a). In addition, they support innate and adaptive immune responses against viral infections. IFN-\u03b1 effectively inhibited SARS-CoV replication in vitro experiments (Str\u00f6her et al. 2004; Zorzitto et al. 2006) . It was shown that Type I interferons with the inclusion of IFN-\u03b2 could inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV in vitro, too (Morgenstern et al. 2005) . It was revealed that SARS-CoV blocked IFN transcription in infected cells and these cells might partly repair their congenital immune responsiveness to SARS-CoV following small amounts of IFNs had been prepared (Kuri et al. 2009 ). It has been shown that cynomolgus monkeys are preserved from SARS-CoV infection via IFN-\u03b1 therapy, too . In a pilot clinical trial, synthetic recombinant IFN-\u03b1 was proved to be active against SARS (Loutfy et al. 2003) . Additionally, IFN-\u03b1-2a and ribavirin combination prolonged the survival of people with severe MERS-CoV infection (Mustafa et al. 2018) . The different controlled test has been launched to test the efficiency of lopinavir/ritonavir and IFN-\u03b1-2b in hospitalized people with SARS-CoV-2 infections (ChiCTR2000029308) (Martinez 2020) . "}, {"section_title": "Convalescent plasma therapy", "text": "Antiviral antibodies, namely, IgG, IgA, IgM, IgE, and IgD available in convalescent plasma can be obtained from recovered patients and they can be used to treat patients viral infections, effectively. So far, this method has been widely utilized in some infectious diseases, for instance, poliomyelitis, influenza A (H5N1), and Ebola (Zhou et al. 2007 ; van Griensven et al. 2016; Rinaldo 2005) . In addition to this, passive immunization might be useful by making use of convalescent plasma from people with SARS-CoV infection. In Taiwan and Hong Kong convalescent plasma therapy has been tested on a small number of SARS-CoVinfected patients during the early course of the outbreak and this method has been determined to be useful (Cheng et al. 2005; Wong and Yuen 2008; Yeh et al. 2005) . In view of these findings, convalescent plasma therapy can be a promising option for the therapy and prevention of COVID-19 pneumonia cases. Convalescent plasma may be called as passive immunotherapy, too. If no specific vaccines or medications are available for arising infection-related diseases, this therapy method is generally applied (Marano et al. 2016 ). The feasibility, safety, and clinical efficacy of this therapy method has been tested in critically ill MERS patients and it has been revealed to have an immunotherapeutic potential (Arabi et al. 2015) . Similarly, convalescent plasma gained from recovered SARS patients has been useful to treat other SARS patients (Cheng et al. 2005; Soo et al. 2004) . One important thing to say is this, World Health Organization under Blood Regulators Network recommends the use of convalescent plasma or serum if there is no vaccination and antiviral medications for an arising virus. Convalescent plasma therapy should be normally used against COVID-19 on critically ill patients if it is available . Now, there are 140 clinical trials to appreciate the efficacy and safety of convalescent plasma for the therapy of COVID-19 and, of them nine trials were completed stage (NIH US National Library of Medicine clinical trial database, https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond= Covid19&term=convalescent+plasma&type=&rslt= &age_v=&gndr=&intr=&titles=&outc=&spons=&lea d=&id=&cntry==&state=&city=&dist=&locn=&rsub= &strd_s=&strd_e=&prcd_s=&prcd_e=&sfpd_s=&sfpd_ e=&rfpd_s=&rfpd_e=&lupd_s=&lupd_e=&sort=)."}, {"section_title": "Monoclonal antibody", "text": "It was determined that one recombinant human monoclonal antibody (mAb) (single-chain variable region fragments, scFvs 80R) inhibited S1 domain of S protein of SARS-CoV (Sui et al. 2004) . Depending on the development of monoclonal antibodies, the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak can be prevented. Several studies revealed that some monoclonal antibodies which aim to the SARS-CoV spike protein could prevent the virus entry into the host cells (ter Meulen et al. 2004; ter Meulen et al. 2006; Traggiai et al. 2004 ). Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies target the 193-amino acid (residues 318-510) receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein to perform their functions ). Considering these works, neutralizing monoclonal antibodies alone or in combination could be a promising therapeutic candidate for the therapy of COVID-19 pneumonia.\nPatients with severe COVID-19 infection experienced a cytokine storm with increased plasma concentrations of interleukins IL-6, IL-2, IL-7, and IL-10 and tumor necrosis factor TNF-\u03b1. This syndrome is described by fever and multiorgan failure. IL-6, interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3), TNF-\u03b1, and IL-10 are cytokines including in cytokine release pathogenesis (Wang and Han 2018) . Especially, IL-6 acts as the central mediator of cytokine release syndrome (Lee et al. 2014) .\nFor the therapy of COVID-19 pneumonia, immunomodulant therapy is not recommended routinely. Nevertheless, considering the clinical and laboratory findings consistent with cytokine release syndrome and considering the formation of pulmonary edema and hyaline membranes, a targeted therapy could be useful in selected patients with severe pneumonia in association with respiratory support during a short time (Lombardy Section Italian Society Infectious and Tropical Diseases 2020).\nCurrently, there are 47 clinical trials are being conducted for monoclonal antibodies in the therapy of COVID-19 and, no study was been completed (NIH US National Library of Medicine clinical trial database, https://www.clinicaltrials. gov/ct2/results?cond=Covid19&term=monoclonal +antibody&type=&rslt=&age_v=&gndr=&intr= &titles=&outc=&spons=&lead=&id=&cntry=&state= &city=&dist=&locn=&rsub=&strd_s=&strd_e=&prcd_ s=&prcd_e=&sfpd_s=&sfpd_e=&rfpd_s=&rfpd_e= &lupd_s=&lupd_e=&sort=).\nTocilizumab Tocilizumab (Fig. 1) is a monoclonal antibody that aims to the IL-6 receptor. This agent can be used against COVID-19 in patients with severe and extensive lung disease with elevated IL-6 levels. Thus, the systemic inflammatory response syndrome by the viral-induced cytokine storm can be discontinued (Lombardy Section Italian Society Infectious and Tropical Diseases 2020). As on date, 65 clinical trials are being carried out to know the efficacy of tocilizumab in COVID-19 pneumonia, of them 4 trials were finished (NIH US National Library of Medicine clinical trial database, https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results? cond=Covid19&term=tocilizumab&type=&rslt=&age_ v=&gndr=&intr=&titles=&outc=&spons=&lead=&id= &cntry=&state=&city=&dist=&locn=&rsub=&strd_s= &strd_e=&prcd_s=&prcd_e=&sfpd_s=&sfpd_e=&rfpd_ s=&rfpd_e=&lupd_s=&lupd_e=&sort=).\nBevacizumab Bevacizumab (Fig. 2) , a humanized monoclonal antibody, aims vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (Clin-icalTrials.gov [Internet] 2020b; Wang et al. 2004 ).

Because cyclosporine A has been used extensively, the survival rates of patients and grafts improved highly following solid-organ transplantation (Ziaei et al. 2016) . It was claimed that nucleocapsid protein (NP) of SARS-CoV had a substantial role in the process of virus particle accumulation and release. In addition, it could connect to human cyclophilin A which is a key member of immunophilins. The function of these are to act as a cellular receptor for cyclosporine A Dawar et al. 2017 ). Cyclophilin (Dawar et al. 2017) . The inhibition of cyclophilins by using cyclosporine A might arrest the replication of coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV (Pfefferle et al. 2011) , so the non-immunosuppressive cyclosporine A derivatives might have the potential as inhibitors against coronaviruses such as emerging newly COVID-19. Now, only 6 clinical trials are being carried out to reveal the efficacy of cyclosporine A against COVID-19 (NIH US National Library of Medicine clinical trial database, https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/ results?cond=Covid19&term=cyclosporine+A&type= &rslt=&age_v=&gndr=&intr=&titles=&outc=&spons= &lead=&id=&cntry=&state=&city=&dist=&locn= &rsub=&strd_s=&strd_e=&prcd_s=&prcd_e==&sfpd_s= &sfpd_e=&rfpd_s=&rfpd_e=&lupd_s=&lupd_e=&sort=)."}, {"section_title": "Mesenchymal stem cells", "text": "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are strong anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory.

Furthermore, MSCs contribute to decreasing lung fibrosis as well as increasing tissue repair (Kumamoto et al. 2009; El Agha et al. 2017 ). The patients with severe COVID-19 infections suffer from cytokine storm syndromes, ARDS, and acute lung injury so MSCs may be an encouraging therapeutic option to prevent these complications. There are 55 clinical trials ongoing about MSCs, of them only 2 trials were finished, now (NIH US National Library of Medicine clinical trial database, https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond= Covid19&term=mesenchymal+stem+cell&type=&rslt= &age_v=&gndr=&intr=&titles=&outc=&spons=&lead= &id=&cntry=&state=&city=&dist=&locn=&rsub=&strd_ s=&strd_e=&prcd_s=&prcd_e=&sfpd_s=&sfpd_e= &rfpd_s=&rfpd_e=&lupd_s=&lupd_e=&sort=).

Dyer et al. (2019) has shown that initial findings of a death rate were 33% in 499 patients under treatment by using remdesivir against the Ebola disease. Moreover, the mortality rate of non-treated infected patients was 75% (almost 1900 people) during the same epidemic period.\nRecently, it was proclaimed that the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved remdesivir for emergency use to treat COVID-19 pneumonia (The FDA has approved emergency use of remdesivir to treat COVID-19).\nMeanwhile, a molecular docking study including five antiviral drugs, ribavirin, remdesivir, sofosbuvir, galidesivir, and tenofovir was conducted against SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), these drugs showed promising results against COVID-19. Further optimization of these agents using a high-quality model of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp might be useful for designing perfect compounds able to prevent this spreading infection (Elfiky 2020) .

This offers that lopinavir/ritonavir could be effective by inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 protein synthesis. Furthermore, several findings proved that treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir alone or in combination together with other antiviral agents developed severe patients with SARS or MERS (Chu et al. 2004; Sheahan et al. 2020; Zumla et al. 2016) .\nThe combination of lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin has improved the course of the disease in SARS-CoV patients (Chu et al. 2004) .\nIn other combination studies with lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin and IFN-\u03b12a carried out in South Korea, a patient with MERS-CoV disease has been successfully treated (Kim et al. 2016 ). Now, lopinavir/ritonavir and IFN-\u03b21b is in phase 2 for the MERS therapy in a randomized controlled trial (Arabi et al. 2018) . Similarly, the therapeutic efficacy of the same combination is being investigated in a sequential randomized controlled trial (Arabi et al. 2020) .\nDespite the positive findings mentioned above, according to a recent study performed on patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, it has been suggested that the lopinavir/ritonavir combination did not provide the clinical improvement compared to standard care processings . Actually, findings of lopinavir/ritonavir clinical efficacy remain limited and primarily anecdotal cases . Although COVID-19 viral load can be decreased via lopinavir/ritonavir application very fast (Lim et al. 2020) , the use of this combination for the therapy of COVID-19 is not advised by the COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel except in a clinical trial (NIH COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines, https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih. gov/antiviral-therapy/lopinavir-ritonavir-and-other-hivprotease-inhibitors/).

Favipiravir is a pro-drug which is converted into an active phosphoribosylated form (Favipiravir-RTP) in cells, then viral RNA polymerase identifies it as a substrate, resulting in inhibiting RNA polymerase function (Furuta et al. 2017 ). Eventually, favipiravir may have a potent antiviral activity for the therapy of COVID-19. The promising outcomes were achieved in a clinical trial with favipiravir against COVID-19 in China. The preliminary results from this study involving 80 patients (a total of the experimental and the control group) stated that favipiravir showed a more powerful antiviral activity than that of lopinavir/ritonavir.

Primarily, they come together in lysosomes, increase endosomal pH, and cut off the lysosome-endosome fusion. Therefore, the transport of virus is blocked . Furthermore, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have been determined to interfere with the angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which has an important receptor for the attachment of COVID-19 into the cell by cell-surface protein glycosylation (Fantini et al. 2020 ). In addition, it was shown that chloroquine had higher efficacy than hydroxychloroquine .\nHydroxychloroquine combined with the macrolide antibiotic azithromycin cured 100% of patients with COVID-19 in a trial, lately. However, hydroxychloroquine alone cured only 57.1% of patients (Gautret et al. 2020) .

Following one decade, the World encountered MERS-CoV, another coronavirus. Nowadays, the rising SARS-CoV-2 turned into a global threat so the WHO proclaimed that the COVID-19 outbreak was a global pandemic in March 2020.\nCOVID-19, previously known as SARS-CoV-2, targets lung cells by connecting to ACE2 protein. This protein is largely produced in some tissues such as bile duct, liver, gastrointestinal organs (e.g., small intestine, duodenum), esophagus, testis, and kidney as well as lung tissue Chai et al. 2020; Anti-2019 -nCoV Volunteers et al. 2020 Fan et al. 2020 ). Thus, COVID-19 may damage these organs and tissues. Now, COVID-19 has extended to various countries speedily, caused severe sickness and these events made it a relevant and considerable public healththreatening. Taking into account the global threatening caused by COVID-19, efficient therapy methods against COVID-19 disease are promptly necessary. Nevertheless, the development of new agents for this disease is still a considerable problem for people in the world, and we have none formally approved agents against COVID-19 pneumonia now. Looking at the epidemiological properties of COVID-19, it is very important to cut off the extending of this virus owing to epidemic prevention as well as checking procedures. For this, the most recommended preventions are putting infected people in quarantine and checking the source of infection. The limited information available we have is needed to develop novel drugs and to find new therapy methods to prevent this outbreak and to treat COVID-19 pneumonia. Furthermore, the design and improvement of vaccines against COVID-19 are also necessary as well as discovering novel agents and clinical trials of known drugs.\nIn this review, we focused on some medicines that have already started with the repositioning for COVID-19 therapy. The repositioning clinical trials seem to be an attractive strategy, thus, the discovery of new classes of drug can be easier, the costs and time for reaching the market can decrease, the pharmaceutical supply chain is available for formulation and distribution, more therapy methods are possible by combining the drugs. We hope that the continuing studies may provide solutions for the prevention and therapy against the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020."}, {"section_title": "Compliance with ethical standards", "text": "Conflict of interest The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.\nPublisher's note Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations."}]
