[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract. Validation of cost-effective, non-invasive methods to identify early (pre-clinical) Alzheimer's disease (AD) is increasingly becoming a key research challenge. We have developed two ELISA sandwich colorimetric tests for the accurate detection of amyloid-\u2424 (A\u2424) 1-40 and A\u2424 1-42 : i) directly accessible (DA) in the plasma, ii) recovered from the plasma sample (RP) after diluting the plasma sample in a formulated buffer, and iii) associated with the remaining cellular pellet (CP). These tests were carried out on samples from healthy controls (n = 19) and individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI; n = 27) with amnestichippocampal syndrome to investigate whether this comprehensive approach may help to explain the association between blood A\u2424 levels and MCI. A logistic regression analysis detected seven direct or calculated markers (CP 40, DA 42, RP 42, DA/CP 40, DA/RP 42, DA/CP 42, and DA 42/40) with significant odds ratios (OR) after they were dichotomized with regard to the median of the pooled population. In particular, the likelihood [OR (95% CI)] of having MCI for patients with catCP 40, catDA/RP 42, catDA/CP 42, or catDA 42/40 below the corresponding population median (\"positive test\") was 11.48 (1.87-70.52), 22.09 (3.19-152.61), 11.48 (1.87-70.50), and 9.54 (1.77-51.38)-fold higher, respectively, than in those with a \"negative test\" after adjusting for the effect of the ApoE genotype. These results are congruent with the hypothesis that changes in blood A\u2424 levels may be associated with the initial stages of AD. Thus, these A\u2424 blood biomarkers might be useful tools for screening for those at increased risk of developing AD."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with extracellular deposition of amyloid peptides (A\u2424), as well as intracellular accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles.

This interpretation of AD's natural history has driven recent research efforts toward developing earlier-course and preventive treatments and the search for surrogate diagnostic biomarkers [8] .\nIn line with this interpretation, the work carried out in large multicenter initiatives such as the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), the Australian Imaging Biomarkers and lifestyle Flagship Study of Ageing (AIBL), European-ADNI (E-ADNI), and many others has led to the proposal of a model in which the most widely validated biomarkers (MRI, PIB-PET, FDG-PET, and CSF levels of A\u2424, tau, and phosphorylated-tau) become abnormal in an ordered sequence that parallels the hypothetical pathophysiological sequence of AD [9, 10] .\nHowever, these well-validated biomarkers are hampered by practical pitfalls that severely limit their application in large populations. The feasibility of these biomarkers for screening the general population once a preventive treatment has been developed also remains questionable. Consequently, there is an increasing interest in the development of blood-based biomarkers among which A\u2424 peptides have attracted particular attention because of their proven mechanistic relationship with AD pathology and accumulating evidence that changes in brain A\u2424 are among the first detectable signs of disease onset [6, [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] .\nOur hypothesis is that changes in blood A\u2424 levels may reflect changes in brain A\u2424 levels due to an amyloid cortical pathology that heralds AD. Indeed, the majority of previous cross-sectional studies showed statistically significant associations between A\u2424 plasma markers (primarily A\u2424 40 , A\u2424 42 , or the A\u2424 42 /A\u2424 40 ratio) and a determined diagnosis [healthy control (HC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] . However, the details of this association remain far from clear and the literature has produced controversial results (for a recent review, see [32] ).\nThere are numerous confounding factors from a variety of sources that blur the presumptive association of A\u2424 blood levels and the diagnosis of AD. These include technical issues, the long pre-clinical course of the disease, and the variable patient history of the elderly, which can affect the metabolism of A\u2424 in different ways [33] . The interaction of all (or several) of these confounding factors could lead to conflicting-even entirely opposite-results coming from different studies.\nAnother relevant source of confusion is the fragmentary knowledge of the biology of A\u2424 in the blood. An important point to be stressed is that A\u2424 peptides in blood can be found free in the plasma, bound to plasma proteins, and bound to blood cells [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] . Therefore, a complete A\u2424 blood test should include the determination of peptide levels in each of these three fractions. Our study represents a first step in this direction and an attempt to gain as much information as possible regarding the distribution of these peptides in the blood. To these ends, we separately assessed the peptide directly accessible in the plasma, the peptide that can be recovered after diluting the plasma sample in a formulated buffer, and the peptide that remains adhered to the cellular pellet after plasma collection.\nThe aim of the present study was to investigate whether this comprehensive approach could help explain the association between blood A\u2424 levels and the early stages of AD."}, {"section_title": "MATERIAL AND METHODS", "text": "The demographic characteristics of the participants are summarized in Table 1 . The HC (n = 19) and MCI (n = 27) diagnostic groups were established according to the routines of the Memory Clinic of Fundaci\u00f3 ACE as described elsewhere [40] . The MCI patients fulfilled the Mayo Clinic criteria with a clinical dementia ratio (CDR) of 0.5 and a normal MMSE. The patients were described as amnesic with hippocampal syndrome based on the Wechsler Memory Scale-III (WMS-III) as described elsewhere [41] . The MCI group was subdivided into those with a negative neuroimage (MCI-NIn; n = 12) suggestive of an earlier disease stage and those with a positive neuroimage (MCI-NIp; n = 15) suggestive of a more advanced disease stage. To be classified as MCI-NIn, patients should present <4 points bilaterally on the Scheltens scale for medial temporal atrophy, as assessed using MRI, and no signs of hypometabolism in the medial temporal or cingular posterior region, as assessed using FDG-PET. To be classified as MCI-NIp, patients present \u22654 points bilaterally on the Scheltens scale and/or signs of hypometabolism in the medial temporal or cingular posterior regions [42] .\nWritten informed consent was obtained from every participant. The study protocols were reviewed and approved by the Ethical Committee of the Hospital Cl\u00ednic i Provincial (Barcelona, Spain). Education level was recorded in five categories depending on the number of years of education. However, cases had to be regrouped into two categories (more or less than 8 years of education) to fulfill the lowest expected frequency condition in the contingency table."}, {"section_title": "Blood sampling and biochemical determinations", "text": "Blood samples from each participant were drawn in the morning after an overnight fast and were collected in polypropylene vials with EDTA and a protease inhibitor cocktail (Complete Mini, Roche Madrid Spain). The samples were immediately cooled to 4\u00baC until processing which occurred in the first 24 hours after collection. The blood samples were centrifuged and both the plasma and the cell pellet were divided into aliquots and stored in polypropylene tubes at \u221280 \u2022 C until analyzed. At no time was the material thawed or refrozen.\nAll samples were analyzed in triplicate in the same run for each of the three blood fractions using two specific ELISA sandwich kits, ABtest 40 and ABtest 42 (Araclon Biotech Ltd. Zaragoza, Spain), as described elsewhere [30] . Before analysis, plasma and blood cell samples were pretreated using dilution in a formulated saline buffer with 1% blocking polymer according to the supplier's instructions.\nWe carried out three counts for both the A\u2424 40 and A\u2424 42 peptides in each blood sample. One count was performed using the undiluted plasma sample, another using the plasma sample diluted 1:3 with the aforementioned formulated buffer, and a third using the cellular pellet that remained after plasma collection. The peptide amount in the undiluted plasma sample corresponds to the directly accessible (DA) peptide. The 1:3 dilution of the plasma was chosen because it provided the maximum peptide recovery from the sample (see Supplementary Figure 1 ; available online: http://dx.doi.org/10.3233/JAD-121744). Thus, this count included the DA peptide and the peptide that was recovered from the plasma matrix (RP). Additionally, the peptide associated with the cellular pellet (CP) was measured in a 1:5 dilution of the pellet that remained after plasma collection. The sum of these three amounts is described as the A\u2424 pool in blood (PIB) for either A\u2424 40 or A\u2424 42 . Additionally, from these directly measured markers, we obtain the ratios of DA/RP, DA/CP, and RP/CP for each peptide and the ratios of DA A\u2424 42 to DA A\u2424 40 (DA42/40), RP A\u2424 42 to RP A\u2424 40 (RP42/40), and CP A\u2424 42 to CP A\u2424 40 (CP42/40) (see Table 2 ).\nThe inter-assay coefficients of variation (CV), as determined by the comparison of the same plasma control samples measured in the assay for either the diluted plasma, undiluted plasma or cells were 4.94% and 11.11% in ABtest40 and ABtest42, respectively. The limit of quantification (LQ) was 4.70 pg/ml for ABtest40 and 5.71 pg/ml for ABtest42. None of the APOE genotyping was performed as previously described [43] , using the amplification of genomic DNA, digestion with HhaI, and further analysis of the restriction fragments."}, {"section_title": "Statistical analysis", "text": "To compare demographic data between the two groups, we ran a Mann-Whitney U-test for continuous variables. Pearson's chi-square test was used for the categorical variables. Binary logistic regression was performed to assess whether the level of chosen markers (split in two by the median of the pooled population) were associated with an increased likelihood of an MCI diagnosis in an unadjusted model and in models adjusted for age, ApoE genotype, or education level. Regarding their distribution within a group, only the markers with a p value <0.05 (MannWhitney test) were analyzed using logistic regression. Four individuals had outlier values for some of the markers, and 13% (six individuals) of the DA A\u2424 42 measurements were below the LQ. Because the primary results were obtained from the logistic regression analyses of dichotomous variables, the influenced of these extreme data was considered irrelevant and they were not excluded from the study. Sensitivity and specificity of the A\u2424 40 and A\u2424 42 blood biomarkers with a significant OR were calculated by determining the most appropriate cutoff from their corresponding receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The correlation between the A\u2424 markers and the hematological and blood biochemical variables was explored using a Spearman test. The SPSS v.20 software was used for statistical analysis.

By contrast, the two MCI subgroups (MCI-NIn and MCI-NIp) were completely homogeneous regarding those variables.\nA group comparison revealed that nine direct and calculated markers differed significantly between HC and MCI (Table 2) . Interestingly, whereas the levels of DA 42 were lower in MCI than in HC, the levels of RP 42 and CP 42 were lower in HC than in MCI (Fig. 1) . The most significant results in the comparison between Fig. 1 . Dot plot graphs of the direct and calculated markers that reached statistically significant differences between healthy controls (HC) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients. ***p < 0.001, **p < 0.01, and *p < 0.05.\nHC and MCI were the DA/RP 42 ratio followed by the DA/CP 42 and DA 42/40 ratios, which were 48%, 45%, and 28% lower in the MCI group than in the HC group, respectively.\nAdditionally, seven of those nine markers (CP 40, DA 42, RP 42, DA/RP 42, DA/CP 42, DA 42/40 and RP 42/40) were found to differ significantly (p value equals 0.014, 0.008, 0.002, <0.001, 0.025, 0.001, 0.001, respectively) when the MCI-NIn group was compared with the HC group. By contrast, no marker displayed significant differences between the two MCI subgroups (MCI-NIn versus MCI-NIp).\nThe binary logistic regression analysis showed that, once transformed in categorical (cat) variables that split the population in two at the median, seven of the nine aforementioned markers differed significantly between HC and MCI and presented significant ORs (Table 3) . Furthermore, catCP 40, catDA/RP 42, catDA/CP 42 and catDA 42/40 maintained a significant OR when each demographic co-variable was compensated for. Thus, the likelihood of being an MCI case for those patients having catCP 40, catDA/RP 42, catDA/CP 42, or catDA 42/40 below the corresponding population median (\"positive test\") was 11.48, 22.09, 11.48, and 9.54-fold higher, respectively, than in those with a \"negative test\" after adjusting for the effect of the ApoE genotype ( Table 4) . The sensitivity and specificity of these selected markers were tentatively assessed using their corresponding ROC curves (Table 4 ). In particular, the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.80 for catDA/RP 42, 0.74 for catDA/CP 42, and 0.75 for catDA 42/40, which are acceptable but not impressive values.\nDirect A\u2424 markers did not generally show a consistent correlation pattern with the hematological and blood biochemical variables (see Supplementary Table 1 ). More significant correlations occurred between CP 42 and serum albumin (r = \u2212407, p = 0.005) and between DA 40 and creatinine (r = 0.615, p < 0.001). Interestingly, DA 40 also showed a significant negative correlation with hematocrit (r = \u22120.351, p = 0.017) and homocysteine (r = 0.344, p = 0.019)."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "In the present work, we found nine markers from the A\u2424 pool in blood that differed significantly between a group of MCI patients of the amnestic-hippocampic type and a HC group. Once they were transformed in categorical variables, four of these markers (CP 40, DA/RP 42, DA/CP 42, and DA 42/40), presented significant ORs even when the logistic regression model was adjusted for each of the relevant demographic covariables. The results showed an association beyond what could be attributable to pure chance between these A\u2424 blood markers and an MCI diagnosis. However, the significance of this association remains controversial, and there is a wealth of literature showing contradictory results (for recent reviews, see [28, 32, 44] ). Nevertheless, apart from other relevant markers, our study revealed that levels of DA 42 and the ratio of DA 42/40 were lower in the MCI group than in the HC group, which is congruent with numerous previous reports [18, 23, 25, 26, 28, 29, [45] [46] [47] [48] . Furthermore, whereas DA 42 was lower in MCI than in HC, levels of RP 42 trended in the opposite direction. This finding could help to explain the variability of results obtained with the different assays used in various studies. It is well known that A\u2424 peptides bind to plasma proteins and blood cells in amounts that depend on various factors that may or may not be related to AD pathology [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [49] [50] [51] [52] . Depending on the ability of a given assay to measure jointly the levels of peptide free in the plasma and a variable proportion of the A\u2424 peptides bound to plasma proteins, a single A\u2424 plasma measurement would fluctuate in one or other direction.\nConcerning this point, our results suggest that separately quantifying the levels of A\u2424 peptides directly accessible in the plasma, the levels recovered from masking interactions with the plasma matrix and the levels associated to the cellular pellet could lead to a more comprehensive assessment of A\u2424 levels in blood (not just in plasma) and their relative distribution among these three blood compartments, improving the diagnostic ability of the A\u2424 blood test. In line with this, five of the seven markers that we have found associated with increased likelihood of being MCI and, in particular, two out of the three with the highest OR (i.e., DA/RP 42, DA/CP 42) included A\u2424 measurements other than those of free peptide levels in the plasma. These findings suggest that there is a clear necessity for a better understanding of the biology and dynamic interactions between A\u2424 peptides and the complex proteome matrix of the plasma. This knowledge would lead to optimization and standardization of protocols that would improve reproducibility of the assays and facilitate comparison of results from between different laboratories [33] . Nevertheless, we believe that both the relatively wide range of the individual measurements within a given group and the considerable overlapping values between groups, indicate that the highest diagnostic value of a given A\u2424 blood marker could be more directly related to its rate of change over the time than to its level at a given moment [8] .\nAll the MCI patients in the present study were clinically characterized as having MCI of the amnestic/hippocampic type known to have a high rate of conversion to AD [17, 53, 54] . Based on published data, those with a positive MRI and/or an FDG-PET neuroimage (MCI-NIp) may be considered to be at a more advanced stage of the disease than those with negative neuroimage biomarkers (MCI-NIn) [6, 15, 16, [55] [56] [57] . Interestingly, CP 40, DA 42, RP 42, DA/RP 42, DA/CP 42, DA 42/40, and RP 42/40 (seven of the nine A\u2424 blood biomarkers that differentiated HC from MCI) were also found to significantly differentiate between HC and MCI-NIn. By contrast, no single A\u2424 blood marker was found to be significantly different between two subgroups of MCI patients when compared with each other (data not shown). These results are congruent with the idea that changes in brain A\u2424 are among the earliest detectable signs in the course of AD, reaching a plateau at the MCI stage and before the manifestation of overt clinical symptoms [9, 58, 59] . Whether this is the case for blood A\u2424 peptides remains to be proven. However, recent reports have provided promising results in this direction. For example, Toledo et al. [26] described a modest but significant correlation between plasma and CSF A\u2424 levels in a sample of 715 ADNI subjects (205 HC, 348 MCI, and 162 AD). This correlation was slightly better between plasma A\u2424 1-42 levels and brain amyloid deposits, thereby confirming results from other studies [60, 61] . Recently, other authors have reported correlations between levels of A\u2424 and A\u2424 free in plasma with the CSF tau/A\u2424 1-42 ratio [38] . Interestingly, a recent publication from the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN) has shown that plasma A\u2424 1-42 levels are significantly higher in carriers of mutations for autosomal dominant AD than in non-carriers five years before such differences reach statistical significance in A\u2424 1-42 CSF levels [62] .\nTaken together, these results have boosted the interest in blood-based biomarkers and both A\u2424 and A\u2424 are increasingly considered moderate risk markers for AD well suited to be used as pharmacodynamic markers and eventually as a minimally invasive screen to identify people at increased risk of developing AD. Ongoing longitudinal studies may validate these results and confirm these hypotheses."}]
