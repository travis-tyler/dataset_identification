Human APP695 was inserted into the pBabepuro retroviral expression vector (21) and transfected into GP+E86 packaging cell line. Stable transformants were selected with puromycin (5 \u00b5g/ml). After infection with recombinant viruses, mouse fibroblasts (LRP +/+ , LRP +/-, and LRP -/-) were selected with puromycin (2.5 \u00b5g/ml) and analyzed without clonal selection. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells overexpressing APP751 with V717F FAD mutation were generated as described previously (22) . A full-length RAP cDNA (GenBank accession no. M63959) was amplified by PCR from a human liver cDNA library (CLONTECH Laboratories, Palo Alto, California, USA) and subcloned into pGEX-4T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, New Jersey, USA). GST-RAP fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified using a glutathione column, according to manufacturer's directions.\nIn vitro A\u03b2 clearance assays. Purified \u03b12M was obtained from Athens Research Laboratory (Athens, Georgia, USA) and activated by methylamine as described (4) . Conditioned medium from CHO cells (IS-CHO; Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, California, USA) overexpressing APP751 with V717F FAD mutation was added to confluent nontransfected LRP +/-and LRP -/-fibroblasts for 48 hours in the presence of 20 nM \u03b12M, and A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 levels were measured by sandwich ELISA. For clearance of iodinated synthetic A\u03b2, 125 I-A\u03b240 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and \u03b12M were incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C, and the incubation mix was added to confluent cultured cells for 24 hours. The medium was then collected and subjected to scintillation counting for \u03b3 radiation.\nHuman subjects and neuropathological evaluation. All subjects were unrelated white Americans of European descent. All pathology-confirmed AD subjects (National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke [NINDS]/Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association [ADRDA] criteria) were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). Senile plaques were identified in thioflavin S-stained sections of the midfrontal cortex and counted under a \u00d710 objective and a \u00d710 ocular lens (field size, 1.6 mm 2 ), as described previously (23) . For quantitation of LRP levels, all LRP T allele-positive AD cases (n = 17) with pathological data and available frozen tissue from the appropriate brain region were entered into the study. Age-matched AD cases with C/C genotype were randomly selected for measurement of LRP levels (n = 20). For assessing amyloid burden, all available pathology-confirmed cases with known LRP genotypes from UCSD-ADRC were included (n = 103). All AD subjects were late-onset AD (\u226560 years at onset of disease). All autopsied control subjects were obtained from the Johns Hopkins University ADRC and the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (24) . APOE and LRP genotyping were performed as described previously (8) .\nQuantitation of LRP levels. Frozen brain tissues derived from the midfrontal cortex of pathologically confirmed control and AD subjects were homogenized in 1% NP40 lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.02% sodium azide, 1% NP40, 100 \u00b5g/ml AEBSF, and 10 \u00b5g/ml leupeptin). For quantitation of LRP in brain, 50 \u00b5g of detergent-soluble protein was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. From the same blots, LRP was detected by a polyclonal Ab against the 85-kDa light chain of LRP (25) , while actin (AC-40; Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Missouri, USA) and synaptophysin (SY38; Roche, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA) were detected by specific mAb's. The primary Ab's were detected by incubation with biotinylated secondary Ab's, followed by 125 I-streptavidin. The signals were quantitated by phosphorimaging (Bio-Rad, Hercules, California, USA). Signals from quantitations were in a linear range, as determined from standards included with each experiment. The LRP, actin, and synaptophysin signal on each blot was first standardized to the internal control. Then the LRP signal was normalized to actin or synaptophysin.\nA\u03b2 measurements. Human plasma samples were collected from living subjects clinically diagnosed as probable AD at the UCSD-ADRC using NINDS/ADRDA criteria. Plasma samples were collected in EDTA tubes and kept at 4\u00b0C until centrifugation. A\u03b2 quantitation was performed using a standard sandwich ELISA. Briefly, microtiter wells were coated with a monospecific Ab that selectively recognizes the carboxy terminal of A\u03b21-40 or A\u03b21-42; the wells were then blocked with 1% BSA/PBS. Human plasma samples were diluted 1:1 in 0.1% CHAPS/PBS and then captured in Ab-coated wells for 18 hours at 4\u00b0C. After binding, wells were washed with PBS, and A\u03b2 was detected with an antihuman A\u03b21-12 mAb (26D6) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Each sample was assayed in triplicate and quantitated to a standard A\u03b2 curve within the linear range. For immunoprecipitation of A\u03b2 from medium of cultured cells, a polyclonal Ab to A\u03b2 (3134) was used as described (26) .\nStatistics. For two-group comparisons between genotypes or disease status, a two-sided t test was used. Where SD was significantly different between groups, Welch's correction was applied to two-sided t tests. ANOVA, coupled with Tukey post hoc test, was used to assess the combinatorial effects of LRP and APOE genotypes on plasma A\u03b2 levels. A \u03c7 2 test for linear trend was used to assess LRP genotype distributions across ordered plaque-number categories among AD subjects. Linear regression analysis was used to assess the magnitude and significance of the correlation between LRP levels and age of subjects."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "LRP mediates the clearance of secreted A\u03b2 without altering A\u03b2 production from APP695.", "text": "It has been demonstrated previously that LRP can serve as a cell surface-internalization receptor for the KPI containing isoforms of secreted APP, including APP751 and APP770 (4) . Moreover, LRP can associate with cellular APP751 at the cell surface and mediate its internalization (27) . Recently, it was shown by Ulery and colleagues that LRP alters A\u03b2 production from the KPI containing APP751, presumably through the KPI-LRP interaction (28) . Thus, it is important to examine the possibility that LRP might be involved in the formation of A\u03b2 from APP695, the major neuronal isoform lacking the KPI domain. To study the effects of LRP expression on A\u03b2 production and clearance, we first established an in vitro cell-culture model using mouse fibroblasts genetically deficient in LRP (LRP -/-) and corresponding LRP-expressing control cells (LRP +/+ and LRP +/-). In these fibroblasts transfected with equivalent levels of human APP695, the levels of A\u03b2 secreted into the medium in the absence of \u03b12M within 24 hours was equivalent between LRP +/-and LRP -/-cells as measured by immunoblotting and sandwich ELISA (Figure 1 , a and b). Addition of RAP, a competitive antagonist of all ligands binding to LRP, had no effect on levels of secreted A\u03b2 during this time period (Figure 1b) . Thus, this indicated that different levels of LRP did not alter the secretion of A\u03b2 from APP695, although the possible role of LRP in other aspects of APP processing cannot be excluded. Having established that LRP does not alter A\u03b2 production within a 24-hour time period, we examined the clearance of endogenously secreted A\u03b2 through the \u03b12M-LRP pathway. Consistent with recent observations in primary neurons (29) , addition of activated \u03b12M directly to serum-free medium of LRP +/+ fibroblasts reduced A\u03b2 levels by approximately 60% (Figure 1c ) within 48 hours. In contrast, \u03b12M had no effect on A\u03b2 levels in LRP -/-cells, indicating that LRP is required for \u03b12M-mediated reduction in A\u03b2. Coincubation of \u03b12M with RAP completely blocked \u03b12M-mediated reduction of A\u03b2 in LRP-expressing cells, confirming the specificity of the LRP pathway in removal of A\u03b2 complexes (Figure 1c) . Interestingly, RAP treatment resulted in higher A\u03b2 levels compared with untreated controls in LRP-expressing cells, suggesting a basal level of RAP-sensitive A\u03b2 clearance activity in untreated controls. In LRP-deficient cells, RAP did not affect the level of A\u03b2 in the presence or absence of \u03b12M (Figure 1c ), indicating that the effects of RAP are specific for LRP and not directly on secretion or removal of A\u03b2. These data clearly demonstrate that secreted A\u03b2 is removed through the \u03b12M-LRP pathway and that LRP is absolutely required for \u03b12M-mediated uptake of A\u03b2. Moreover, A\u03b2 production from APP695 is not affected by LRP.\nLRP mediates the clearance of secreted A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 through a bona fide receptor-mediated mechanism. It has been suggested previously that LRP can mediate the internalization and degradation of A\u03b2 complexes in vitro (16) . However, it has not been directly demonstrated that uptake of A\u03b2 complexes by cultured cells is through a bona fide receptor-mediated mechanism. This issue is highlighted by previous observations that A\u03b2 can be internalized by fluid-phase pinocytosis and by the scavenger-receptor pathway in macrophages (30, 31) . Moreover, it is not known whether the LRP pathway is capable of mediating the clearance of A\u03b242, a minor but putatively pathogenic species of A\u03b2 that are initially deposited in senile plaques (32) . To test whether A\u03b242 is removed through the LRP pathway, conditioned medium from CHO cells overexpressing V717F FAD mutant APP was added to native (i.e., untransfected) LRP +/-and LRP -/-cells in the presence of \u03b12M. As shown in Figure 2a , \u03b12M significantly reduced the levels of soluble A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 in the medium of LRP +/-cells to similar degrees. As expected, neither A\u03b240 nor A\u03b242 levels were affected by \u03b12M in LRP -/-cells, indicating the requirement of LRP in \u03b12M-mediated clearance of A\u03b2. Approximately 65% of A\u03b240 and 60% of A\u03b242 was cleared from the medium within These data show that the LRP pathway efficiently mediates the uptake and degradation of the highly pathogenic A\u03b242 species as well as A\u03b240.\nTo demonstrate that A\u03b2 uptake by the \u03b12M-LRP pathway is through a bona fide receptor-dependent mechanism, we next assessed the uptake of synthetic 125 I-labeled A\u03b2 in cultured fibroblasts. We first determined the optimal ratio of 125 I-\u03b12M/A\u03b2 for in vitro uptake of A\u03b2 through LRP using a fixed physiological concentration of 0.1 nM A\u03b2. As shown in Figure 2b , an increasing amount of \u03b12M facilitated the uptake of 125 I-A\u03b2 in a concentration-dependent manner in LRP +/-cells. Maximal uptake of A\u03b2 was approximately 60% (Figure 2b ), consistent with soluble A\u03b2 produced from cultured cells. As anticipated, there was little to no uptake of 125 I-A\u03b2 in LRP -/-cells at any tested concentration of \u03b12M (Figure 2b ). Increasing amounts of unlabeled A\u03b2/\u03b12M complex effectively blocked the removal of 125 I-A\u03b2 in a concentration-dependent fashion, such that excess cold A\u03b2/\u03b12M inhibited 125 I-A\u03b2 uptake as effectively as the addition of RAP (Figure 2c ). Finally, uptake of 125 I-A\u03b2/\u03b12M complex was completely saturable with half-maximal uptake at 50 pM 125 I-A\u03b2/1 nM \u03b12M complex, an approximate K d range (0.2-10 nM) that has been reported for binding of \u03b12M to a variety of cell types (33) (Figure 2d) .\nReduced LRP levels correlate with increased AD susceptibility. Having established that the level of LRP expression is critical for A\u03b2 clearance in vitro, we next assessed whether LRP levels in the human brain might be altered during normal aging or disease. Measurement of LRP levels in the brain were performed by quantitative immunoblotting of the LRP 85-kDa light chain from the midfrontal cortex of AD and normal controls (NC). From pathology-confirmed AD and control age-matched subjects, LRP levels relative to actin were approximately twofold lower in AD brains compared with that of controls (Figure 3a : t = 4.884, df = 76, P < 0.0001; Table 1) . Surprisingly, among control subjects there was a strong inverse correlation between age and LRP levels (n = 39, r = -0.4905, P = 0.0015), indicating that LRP expression normally declines with age. As shown in Table   1162 The Percentage of A\u03b2 uptake is normalized to maximal A\u03b2 uptake in the absence of unlabeled A\u03b2/\u03b12M complex. (d) To determine whether A\u03b2 uptake is subject to saturation, increasing amounts of 125 I-A\u03b2/\u03b12M complex (mixed as before) were added to confluent LRP +/-cells for 24 hours, and the medium was collected and subjected to scintillation counting for \u03b3-radiation. A\u03b2 uptake is calculated in femtomoles and represented in a log scale. All experiments were performed three times in triplicate, and a representative experiment is shown. Error bars represent SEM. 1, the average reduction in brain LRP level was approximately twofold between an age group of 40-64 (0.76 \u00b1 0.11 SEM, n = 11) and those equal to or greater than 85 (0.37 \u00b1 0.05 SEM, n = 6), with intermediate LRP expression among the age group of 65-84 (0.53 \u00b1 0.06 SEM, n = 22). Interestingly, this inverse correlation was markedly stronger among noncarriers of the APOE \u03b54 allele (Figure 3c : n = 28, r = -0.6758, P = 0.00008). When LRP levels were normalized to synaptophysin instead of actin, a similar inverse correlation with age and LRP expression was observed among all control subjects (n = 39, r = -0.3948, P = 0.0128), indicating that the observed effect is not attributable to neuronal/synaptic loss. In contrast to that observed in control subjects, higher LRP levels significantly correlated with later ages at onset of AD (n = 37, r = 0.33465, P = 0.0429) and death (n = 37, r = 0.41032, P = 0.0169). Importantly, LRP levels were still lower in AD patients after the age of 80 (0.34 \u00b1 0.05 SEM, n = 17) compared with age-matched control subjects (0.48 \u00b1 0.05 SEM, n = 13), although the largest differences were observed under the age of 85 (Table 1) . Interestingly, the positive correlation between LRP levels and age of onset (Figure 3d : n = 15, r = 0.60483, P = 0.0116) and death (n = 15, r = 0.63599, P = 0.0108) resulted primarily from individuals lacking the APOE \u03b54 allele. Thus, the LRP effect is predominant among approximately 50% of AD cases where currently no genetic susceptibility is attributed because pathogenic effects associated with APOE \u03b54 may be sufficient by itself to confer AD risk. Duration of disease from onset to death had no effect on LRP levels (graph not shown: n = 37, r = 0.081, P = 0.6357), indicating that the decline in LRP expression is unrelated to ADrelated brain aberrations.\nGenetic association of LRP with LRP levels, amyloid burden, and plasma A\u03b2. In view of the preceding observations, we next asked whether the correlation between LRP levels and AD susceptibility can be confirmed by a different analysis. The recently reported under-representation of the LRP exon 3 (C766T) polymorphism in late-onset AD has been demonstrated in five different populations (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) , although the putative causative mutation/polymorphism in linkage disequilibrium with the C766T polymorphism remains to be identified. Because our current results demonstrated that the level of LRP in the brain is correlated with disease onset, we examined whether a manifestation of the C766T polymorphism is also reflected in LRP expression. Analysis of LRP geno- type status revealed significantly higher LRP levels among AD cases harboring the C/T or T/T genotypes compared with carriers of the C/C genotype (Figure 4a : t = 2.335, df = 35, P = 0.0254), although still lower than that of control subjects. Because LRP T allele carriers have higher age at onset of AD than LRP C/C carriers as reported previously (8), we confined the analysis to comparable ages. In an age group (70-82 years) where there was no difference in ages at death between C/C (n = 16, 76.4 \u00b1 0.18 SD) and T-positive genotypes (n = 11, 77.3 \u00b1 0.15 SD), the same significant difference was observed (t = 2.424, df = 25, P = 0.0229). Higher LRP levels in AD are therefore associated with the protective effects of the T allele, consistent with under-representation of the T allele in AD (8) . Different APOE genotypes, however, did not alter the level of LRP in AD brains (data not shown).\nNext, we assessed whether the LRP T-allele associates with total amyloid burden in AD. Extending our previous analysis of neuritic plaques in brains of AD individuals (8), we assessed the total amount of thioflavin S-positive plaques, regardless of type, as an indicator of amyloid burden. LRP T allele carriers showed significantly fewer numbers of total senile plaques compared with C/C carriers, using t-test analysis (t = 2.860, df = 101, P = 0.0051). To examine the plaque-density profile of LRP T-positive versus C/C carriers, AD cases were segregated into four increasing levels of plaque-density categories. Statistical analysis revealed that the LRP T allele was excessively over-represented in the lower plaque-density categories as compared with the C/C genotype ( Figure  4b : \u03c7 2 for linear trend = 11.762, df = 1, P = 0.0006). The LRP-associated effects on amyloid burden were not dependent on the underlying APOE genetic status, because the same trend was observed among subjects that did not carry the APOE \u03b54 allele (Figure 4c : \u03c7 2 for linear trend = 6.135, df = 1, P = 0.0133).\nAmyloid burden in postmortem AD brain tissues represents a terminal state that may not accurately reflect the dynamic in vivo relationship between LRP expression and A\u03b2 levels. Moreover, the measurements of A\u03b2 in the brain is confounded by the presence of multiple pools with heterogeneous solubilities. Thus, we analyzed A\u03b2 levels in human plasma to determine whether LRP genotypes associate with levels of soluble A\u03b2 in vivo. Consistent with higher LRP levels among LRP Tallele carriers, A\u03b2 in plasma was significantly decreased by 58% in carriers of the LRP T allele compared with carriers of the C/C genotype ( Table 2: Welch's t = 2.627, df = 60, P = 0.0109). Surprisingly, plasma A\u03b2 level was also significantly lower (by 54%) in non-APOE \u03b54 carriers compared with carriers of the APOE \u03b54 allele ( Table  2: Welch's t = 2.478, df = 55, P = 0.0163), indicating that apoE4 not only increases amyloid burden in the brain (34) , but also the amount of soluble A\u03b2 systemically. This finding led us to ask whether there are any additive effects between LRP and APOE genotypes. The highest A\u03b2 levels were found among carriers of both LRP C/C genotype and APOE \u03b54 allele, which was greater than twofold more than carriers of both LRP Tallele and non-APOE \u03b54 genotypes (Table 2 : ANOVA, F = 3.0504, P = 0.03506; post hoc Tukey, P < 0.05)."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The genetic associations of APOE, \u03b12M, and LRP to lateonset AD are particularly intriguing in light of the fact that both apoE and \u03b12M are two key ligands for LRP (5, 6, 8) . Both apoE and \u03b12M avidly bind A\u03b2 in vitro and in vivo (5, 35) . These observations, together with the finding that LRP and all of its ligands are present in senile plaques (7), strongly implicate the pathogenic importance of the LRP pathway in AD. We found that LRP levels are significantly reduced in AD, compared with healthy controls. Linear-regression analysis revealed that LRP levels progressively decline with the increasing age of control subjects (an inverse correlation) and are further reduced in AD subjects. Among AD patients, however, increased LRP levels were correlated with later age of disease onset, indicating that higher LRP levels might be protective against AD. This apparent protective effect was accentuated among noncarriers of the APOE \u03b54 allele. As increasing age is the primary risk factor for AD, these data indicate that reduced LRP expression may be one factor contributing to AD susceptibility. This notion is highly consistent with the negative association of the LRP T allele to AD (8, 9, 11, 12) and increased LRP levels among T-allele carriers demonstrated in this study. Although the biological mode of the LRP T allele requires further characterization, we hypothesize that the C766T polymorphism is in linkage disequilibrium with a causative mutation or polymorphism that regulates LRP expression (for example, promoter/enhancer) in the aging brain.\nIn the current study, we provide compelling evidence that A\u03b2 uptake via the \u03b12M-LRP pathway is through a bona fide receptor-mediated mechanism and not through nonspecific A\u03b2 degradation or fluid-phase pinocytosis. This was shown by the competition of 125 I-"}, {"section_title": "1164", "text": "The Journal of Clinical Investigation | November 2000 | Volume 106 | Number 9 Table 2 Association of LRP and APOE genotypes with plasma A\u03b2 among clinically diagnosed AD patients Plasma A\u03b2 (ng/ml) \u00b1 SD (n) P value A\u03b2 uptake with excess unlabeled A\u03b2 complexes and the complete saturation of 125 I-A\u03b2 uptake at physiological concentrations. So far, no other A\u03b2 uptake pathway meets the criteria for a bona fide receptor-mediated mechanism. Although the scavenger receptor has been postulated to mediate the uptake of amyloid fibrils, such process is not subject to competition and saturation of the receptor (30, 31) . At another level of A\u03b2 catabolism, recent observations have indicated that neutral endopeptidase and insulin-degrading enzyme are both capable of degrading extracellular A\u03b2 in a cellautonomous manner (36, 37) . Thus, it is likely that there are multiple ways of mediating A\u03b2 degradation in vivo."}, {"section_title": "LRP", "text": "Our study demonstrated that LRP does not alter the secretion of A\u03b2 from APP695-expressing cells but is required for \u03b12M-mediated clearance of soluble A\u03b2. Because both LRP and APP695 are predominantly expressed in neurons, reduced LRP levels in the AD brain is predicted to negatively impact the clearance of soluble A\u03b2 but not its production in neurons. However, it is important to note that LRP overexpression in LRP-deficient CHO cells results in altered trafficking of KPI containing APP751 (28) , possibly through the APP-LRP physical interaction (4). Thus, it is possible that LRP also alters APP trafficking (i.e., internalization/recycling) and A\u03b2 generation through other mechanisms. As APP isoforms are differentially expressed in neurons and glia, LRP-clearance activity versus altered APP trafficking might be differentially modulated across cell types.\nThe genetic association of LRP T polymorphism with both increased LRP expression and reduced amyloid deposition is intriguing in light of the in vitro evidence of A\u03b2 clearance through the LRP pathway (16, 17) . These observations are now further strengthened by genetic association of LRP with soluble A\u03b2 levels in plasma. It is noteworthy that the pathogenic A\u03b242 species is as effectively cleared through the LRP pathway as A\u03b240 ( Figure  1a) , an activity that may dramatically impact amyloid deposition in vivo. Accordingly, we interpret these data to indicate that reduced LRP expression, at least in part, contributes to increased A\u03b2 levels and amyloid deposition by negatively impacting A\u03b2 clearance. This interpretation is consistent with our observation that reduced LRP expression is also correlated with increased AD susceptibility and earlier age of disease onset. In our cell-culture system, we demonstrated the requirement of LRP in the \u03b12M-mediated clearance of A\u03b2. However, it has been reported that apoE and lactoferrin, two other LRP ligands, also sequester A\u03b2 and mediate its clearance (16, 38) . Thus, reduced LRP levels may impede the clearance of various A\u03b2 complexes. Interestingly, many LRP ligands, including apoE, \u03b12M, and lactoferrin, are produced from astrocytes, whereas LRP is largely expressed in neurons. Thus, it is likely that receptor-mediated uptake and clearance of soluble A\u03b2 complexes occur in neurons, whereas uptake of fibrillar amyloid is mediated by microglia (30, 31) . In this regard, downregulation of LRP expression has been linked to proinflammatory stimuli such as LPS and IFN-\u03b3 in cultured cells (39, 40) .\nWe speculate that proinflammatory processes present in the AD brain may induce downregulation of LRP expression, further reducing A\u03b2 clearance and enhancing amyloid deposition. Since LRP mediates the normal function of neuronal remodeling through internalization of apoE (19) , reduced LRP expression in aging and disease may also compromise neuronal viability independent of the effects on A\u03b2 clearance.\nIt has been demonstrated previously that the APOE \u03b54 allele promotes amyloid deposition (34) . Our unexpected finding that the APOE \u03b54 allele is also associated with higher A\u03b2 levels in plasma of AD subjects raises the possibility that different isoforms of apoE may also impact the removal of soluble A\u03b2. This is in agreement with the binding affinity of native apoE isoforms for A\u03b2 (apoE2 > apoE3 > apoE4) (15, 41) and reduced LRP-dependent uptake of apoE4/A\u03b2 complexes in CHO cells (38) . However, the possibility that apoE4 interferes with A\u03b2 clearance by accelerating A\u03b2 aggregation cannot be excluded, consistent with the delayed amyloid deposition in apoE-deficient mice (42) . Two recent studies surprisingly have shown that human apoE actually delays A\u03b2 deposition in apoE-null mice, with apoE3 being more effective than apoE4. On the other hand, apoE is required for fibrillar A\u03b2 deposits, and apoE4 converts A\u03b2 to fibrillar deposits faster than apoE3 in a mouse model of human apoE expression (43, 44) . These observations are consistent with the notion that apoE4 may both impede LRP-mediated A\u03b2 clearance and promote A\u03b2 fibrillogenesis.\nThe results of the current study provided the first in vivo evidence of the LRP-clearance pathway in AD pathogenesis. Our observations lead us to postulate that reduced LRP expression is a contributing risk factor for AD, possibly by impeding clearance of soluble A\u03b2 complexes. Functional characterization of \u03b12M polymorphisms associated with AD (6) and future transgenic animal models of LRP and/or \u03b12M expression should further elucidate the mechanism of A\u03b2 clearance and AD pathogenesis. The observation that AD risk or protection associated with LRP levels is strongest among noncarriers of the APOE \u03b54 allele is particularly interesting in light of the ligand/receptor relationship between apoE and LRP. Because the receptor function of LRP obviously depends on intact activity of its ligands, we hypothesize that high levels of LRP cannot effectively rescue the pathogenic effects of apoE4, the latter operating at a step that negates the clearance mechanism. However, in the presence of apoE2 or apoE3, where the ligand complexes are not perturbed, alterations in LRP level and, in turn, clearance activity become highly consequential for AD pathogenesis. Since increased LRP expression may promote both neuronal survival mediated by apoE2 and apoE3 isoforms and also enhance the clearance of soluble A\u03b2 complexes, the current data provide an alternative direction for AD therapeutic intervention by targeting the A\u03b2/LRP clearance pathway in non-APOE \u03b54 carriers."}]
