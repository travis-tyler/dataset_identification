[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) has drastically spread throughout the world and become a massive threat to humanity (WHO, 2019) . Most healthcare systems and governing bodies of developed countries are struggling to control the spread of this pandemic (Lai et al., 2020) . Quick preventative actions are challenging in curbing its spread since the causative agent of this disease is a novel SARS-related Coronavirus (CoV) or SARS-CoV-2. This particular strain of the virus was unknown before the outbreak that took place in Wuhan, China; therefore, its ambiguous pattern of transmission and pathogenicity is an ongoing and unrelenting threat to public health and the global economy (Lai et al., 2020; .\nCoVs, members of the Coronaviridae family and the Coronavirinae subfamily were considered insignificant pathogens for humans before the outbreak of SARS occurred in 2002 and 2003, which originated in the Guangdong province, China (Fung and Liu, 2019) . Coronavirinae has been divided into four categories: Alpha; Beta, Gamma and Deltacoronavirus (Fung and Liu, 2019) . These pathogens were described as the \"virology backwater\" since very little was known about their virulence (Cavanagh et al., 2005) . In the past couple of decades, they have caught the attention of the scientific community several times due to their zoonotic characteristics. The Betacoronavirus group especially consists of the riskiest Human CoVs (HCoVs), such as HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (Cui et al., 2019) .\nWithin itself, coronavirinae has vast genetic diversity, but these have mostly been found in bats (Lau et al., 2019) . This mammalian host poses a serious threat to CoV outbreaks (Fan et al., 2019) . A possible reason behind this occurrence is that members of Coronavirinae frequently undergo RNA recombination inside bats and often generate novel CoVs (Cui et al., 2019; Lau et al., 2019) . SARS-CoV-2, a member of Betacoronavirus, most probably originated in bats and transmitted to humans via intermediary animals in Wuhan, China. This transmission started the COVID-19 pandemic around December 2019 (Wu and McGoogan, 2020) . SARS-CoV-2, a positive-stranded (+) RNA virus, spreads from an infected person to a healthy individual via respiratory droplets as a result of sneezing and/or coughing . The presence of SARS-CoV-2 is also observed in the stool; thus contaminated water supply might promote transmission . The virions pass through the upper respiratory tract of the host, then enter the lung cells by engaging Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) and Transmembrane Serine Protease 2 (TMPRSS2) (Hoffmann et al., 2020) . This entry triggers innate immunity; as a result, the following inflammatory cytokines become elevated: Interleukin (IL) -2, IL-10, IL-7, Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (GCSF), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1), Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins (MIP) 1A, Interferon gamma-induced protein-10 (IP-10) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF\u03b1) (Wu and McGoogan, 2020) . Consequently, patients develop indistinguishable flu-like symptoms such as cough, sore throat, headache, fatigue, myalgia, breathlessness, conjunctivitis and/or fever. In the worst cases, patients develop pneumonia leading to respiratory failure and death . To alleviate these symptoms, physicians are non-specifically applying antiparasitics such as Ivermectin and the antiviral drug Remdisivir, along with other antiviral therapeutics. Plasma therapy is also helping many patients to survive (Wu and McGoogan, 2020; Gao et al., 2020; Cascella et al., 2020; Caly et al., 2020; Eastman et al., 2020) .\nA recent in vitro study revealed a potential clinically proven protease inhibitor that can block TMPRSS2, and consequently the entry of SARS-CoV-2 (Hoffmann et al., 2020) . Conducting similar studies will help to reveal a variety of possible therapeutics and druggable targets, which increases the probability of creating successful treatments against COVID-19. In silico approaches are the most suitable way to execute this type of research in a short time with nearly zero cost. Powerful computational methods such as subtractive proteomics, comparative genomics or virtual screening can determine therapeutic targets and help develop drugs against bacteria, fungi or non-communicable diseases (Hossain et al., 2018; Abadio et al., 2011; Bhattacharjee et al., 2020) . Unfortunately, for viral infections, this type of combined rational approach is hardly seen. As a result, unveiling the potential targets, novel drugs, interferons (IFNs) and immunodominant vaccines against COVID-19 will be extremely challenging if the virus becomes resistant against different therapeutics.\nIn this study, we propose a combined in silico approach to recognize plausible therapeutics. Here, we have sequenced one SARS-CoV-2 isolate from Bangladesh and identified the regions that are relatively conserved in more than 67,000 isolates. Several computational techniques were then merged to develop treatments against those conserved regions. Using these techniques, a chimeric vaccine (which is not dependent only on spike protein), small druggable molecules, and Small Interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were developed. Additionally, a comparative genome analysis was carried out between SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV to detect the genetic similarity. SARS-CoV-1 showed close genetic relation and virulence pattern with SARS-CoV-2. Thus, a transcriptomic analysis of this related virus was performed to retrieve the IFN inducing genes to implement IFN based therapy."}, {"section_title": "Sample collection and processing", "text": "The viral isolate (SARS-CoV-2/human/BGD/NIB-BCSIR_02/2020) was collected from a 45-year-old female patient who was tested positive for COVID-19 by Reverse-Transcriptase Polymeric Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) along with the symptoms such as cough, mild fever, and throat congestion.

SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of this pandemic, can undergo frequent mutations, adaptations and transmission, which will, unfortunately, pose a continuous risk of outbreaks (Gurwitz et al., 2020) . To confront these future risks, the sustainable development of therapeutics against this deadly virus is necessary. In this study, we have exploited a large number of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences including one from our group and merged several computational approaches to propose therapeutics that could be effective against all the strains of SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 1) . To achieve this goal of therapeutic efficacy, we have identified some therapeutic regions that have a decent level of conservation in the genome. Alongside this, whole genomes of SARS-CoV-2 from different countries were explored to find out their conserved region (Supplementary Data 1) . Among all the strains, several consensus regions were obtained (Supplementary Data 2, 3 and Supplementary Fig. 1) . The proposed chimeric vaccine, drug compounds and siRNA therapeutics were developed against those conserved regions (Supplementary Data 3) .\nMost other studies focused only on the S protein for vaccine development. This study targets both S and M proteins for vaccine and siRNA development. The vaccine candidates contain several well-conserved B and T cell epitopes (Table 1, Supplementary Table 1 ). The epitopes were joined to design a chimeric vaccine which is expected to elicit TLR4 mediated Th1 antiviral response. Immune simulation analysis showing that this vaccine can produce memory B and T cells (Fig. 3D & 3F) . The vaccine is expected to induce inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines in sufficient amounts with non-allergen activities. Since the vaccine contains very few toxic peptides (Supplementary Table 2 ), in vitro and in vivo validation are required before the actual application. Again, the constructed expression vector should successfully produce adequate vaccine molecules in E. coli strain K12, considering that the half-life of the protein is >10 h inside the bacterial host with an acceptable stability index (Fig. 4) .\nA universal drug is necessary to reduce the post-infection consequences of COVID-19. For coronaviruses, RdRp is an attractive therapeutic target that catalyzes the replication of RNA from the RNA template. Thus, we targeted the conserved RNA directed RdRP protein from SARS-CoV-2 (Supplementary Data 3). The virtual screening directed by the RdRP protein identified six experimental compounds from the DrugBank server (Supplementary Table 4 ). Later, the molecular docking analysis revealed a higher binding affinity between the compounds and the RdRp receptor. All the interacting residues between the drug compounds and the RdRp receptor were located in the predicted drug binding site (Fig. 5) . Among the ADMET properties, all the experimental compounds exhibited sufficient human intestinal absorption, a higher metabolic rate, no blood-brain barrier permeability (Supplementary Table 5 ). Moreover, the toxicity levels of these compounds appeared to be safe for humans (Supplementary Table 5 ). These characteristics are significant for drug development since poor ADMET properties could exclude a drug in phase III clinical trial.\nRNA interference (RNAi) pathway is very efficient and specific in viral gene silencing, but only in post-transcription. Here, siRNAs (small interfering RNAs) can play a therapeutic role (Elbashir et al., 2001) . The mRNA sequences have potential sense siRNA strands CAGUAUAAUUAAUAACUAA and GGUUUUUGUAUAUAAUUAA from S and M, respectively (Supplementary Tables 6 and 7) . Therefore, the 19mer and 21mer nucleotides of the sense and antisense strands were designed based on siRNA universal rules. The thermodynamic value and strong interaction between antisense and viral mRNA strongly support its prospective application ( Fig. 6A and 6B ). These siRNAs might be Fig. 7 . The whole-genome comparison among the SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS CoV. MERS seems to be distantly related as it showed only 29% similarity with the SARS-CoV-2. Besides, SARS-CoV shared 88% similarity with the newly evolved SARS-CoV-2 virus. The variation found only in ORF1ab, Spike and ORF8 region of SARS-CoV-2 with SARS-CoV. Alternatively, the orf1ab region from MERS is similar to SARS-CoV-2.\nconjugated with aptamer or delivered through various delivery systems to inhibit the intracellular growth of SARS-CoV-2.\nIFNs instigate an array of antiviral effectors. Though every virus contains a distinctive property, partly overlapping antiviral IFN Stimulating Genes (also known as \"ISG profile\") could be a potential target (Jassal et al., 2020) . IFN effectors target various phases of the virus life cycle to interfere with viral infection and proliferation. To identify the ISG and IFN of COVID-19 cases, the gene expression profile of COVID-19 patients was needed, but it was not available. Therefore, three genomes of Betacoronavirus that have common virulence patterns, signs and symptoms were taken, including SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. A comparison of their genome was performed. The whole- genome comparison between SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 showed 88% similarity with each other (Fig. 7 and Supplementary Fig. 4) . Therefore, the SARS-CoV-1 expression profile was investigated to identify ISG and IFNs. Based on this connection, we analyzed the genome-wide expression profile of SARS patients which unveiled suitable genes/receptors for the IFN-based therapeutics (Supplementary Data 4-9). A total of 167 immunoregulatory genes (91 up-regulated genes and 76 down-regulated genes) were found from the biological process of GO (Fig. 8, Supplementary Fig. 5, Supplementary Data 9-17) . We then identified the IFN stimulating genes KPNA4, IRF7, OAS3, CAMK2G, IFITM1, IFIT1, EGR1, MX1 and IFNAR2 from the up-regulated immuno-regulatory genes and TRIM8, VCAM1, IFNGR2, JAK1 from the down-regulated immuno-regulatory genes (Fig. 9) . The functions of these immune-regulatory genes can be modulated by the interferons IFN alpha, IFN beta and IFN gamma which can directly induce the antiviral pathways and immunological responses (Fig. 9, Supplementary Fig. 6 , Supplementary Data 17-25) . This analysis provides deep insight into the type 1 IFN based therapy for COVID-19 patients."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "The present study has proposed several therapeutics including chimeric vaccine, potent drugs, siRNAs and ISG targets against COVID-19.
