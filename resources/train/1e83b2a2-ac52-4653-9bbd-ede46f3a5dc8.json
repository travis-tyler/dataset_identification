With these trainings, it is aimed to contribute to the teachers to pose well-structured problems that can meet the current needs of the curriculum. Studies argues that well-structured and carefully posed problems contribute to the positive attitude towards mathematics (Barlow and Cates, 2006). It is very important for teachers to produce problems in order to consider teaching effectiveness and evaluation from different perspectives. It is considered crucial to investigate the problem posing skills of teachers considering the importance of enriching the learning with the problems they posed in line with the requirements of education, confronting the students with different and distinctive problems, involving students in the process, and the role of teachers in developing problem posing skills of students. In this study, it is aimed to investigate the problem posing skills of secondary school mathematics teachers concerning data processing learning field. Method: Case study is used as a research method. The Problem Posing Test developed by the researcher is used as a data collection tool. In this test, there are four different problem situations. Teachers are expected to pose problems according to these problem situations. In order to examine entirely, semi-structured interviews are conducted with each of the teachers about the problems that they pose. In addition, the problems that teachers pose in the classroom are also observed. Descriptive analysis and content analysis related to qualitative data analysis techniques are used in data analysis of the research. In descriptive analysis; the theoretical framework of Stoyanova and Ellerton (1996), the categories that take part in the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study [TIMSS] (2011), and the scheme of Silver and Cai (2005) are reorganized and used. In the content analysis, the categories and codes created by the researcher are used. Findings: At the end of the research, it is seen that the teachers have successfully posed mathematics problems. When these problems are analyzed in terms of content, it is seen that they are structured correctly in a conceptual way but they contain language and expression errors. When the problems are evaluated from a contextual point of view, it is pointed out that they are not narrated enough and associated with daily life. One of the important results of the research is that some of the problems require implementation. Problems requiring knowledge and reasoning become the least preferred ones by the teachers."}, {"section_title": "Discussion and Conclusion:", "text": "At the end of this research, it is seen that most of the teachers have posed solvable mathematics problems. 24 problems are evaluated as mathematics problem, 1 problem is analyzed as insoluble, and 3 problems are not considered as a problem. In their research, \u015eeng\u00fcl and Katranc\u0131 (2014) who examined the skills of mathematics teacher candidates about their free problem posing situation concluded that mathematics problems have been posed adequately. Akdemir and T\u00fcrn\u00fckl\u00fc (2017), who conducted a similar study, stated that the sixth grade students have been able to pose a solvable mathematics problem with a ratio of 77.5%. This success achieved from free problem posing situation can be associated with the fact that teachers and teacher candidates have free problem posing situations. In the interviews conducted during the research process, the teachers' remarks about the fact that they pose problems during lessons supports this statement. During the interviews with the teachers, they stated that they had difficulty at some points of the problem posing process. Similar results of this study are also encountered in the studies conducted by \u00c7etinkaya with students (2017) and K\u0131rnap-D\u00f6nmez with teacher candidates (2014). One of the difficulties expressed by teachers in this research process comes up as \"How should I pose a problem?\" The teachers state that they have difficulty in determining which of the question types would be more appropriate when they encounter with a problem situation. The teachers have expressed that the thought \"Which student profile should I pose a problem for?\" is one of the points that creates difficulty. The results of the study conducted by Mallart, Font and Diez (2017) with teacher candidates also indicate that teacher candidates have difficulty in posing problems which can be described as difficult for students. One of the points expressed by the teachers during the interview process is to make sentences that are correctly structured in terms of language and expression. Teachers state that they have difficulty in making proper and meaningful sentences. Some teachers even state that they avoid long sentences and narration. A similar result of this study is found in a study with teacher candidates which is conducted by Erdo\u011fan and G\u00f6kkurt-\u00d6zdemir (2017). In the results of the study conducted by I\u015f\u0131k and Kar (2015), it is stated that students have low verbal problem posing skills. One of the important results obtained from the research is that teachers do not pose creative and original problems and they have difficulty in posing them. Teachers have posed routine problems with which we can encounter in many books. The main reason for this could be the fact that teachers are very dependent on textbooks and other supplementary resources. This dependence prevents teachers from posing problems in accordance with the needs during the lesson. Based on these results, suggestions for the development of teachers' problem posing skills are presented in the research."}]
