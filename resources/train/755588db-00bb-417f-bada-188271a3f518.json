It combines destruction indexes at the district level with 13 yearly rounds of household level surveys from Jamaica. The empirical strategy exploits variation arising from the storms' timing and intensity across different cohorts within the same district. The findings suggest that when expectant mothers living in coastal-rural areas are affected by at least two hurricanes, their children are 56 percentage points more likely to show low birth weight. Furthermore, these children also experience negative impacts on anthropometric measurements taken within the first five years of life equivalent to 1.88 standard deviations in weight-for-age and 1.4 standard deviations in weight-for-height.\nJEL classification: I12, J13, O15, Q54"}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "This study analyses the effects of weather shocks suffered during pregnancy on humans' early physical development. The study provides evidence related to the \"fetal origins\" hypothesis pioneered by Barker (1990) focusing on the effects of tropical storms and hurricanes that occur during gestation periods on anthropometric measurements taken during the first five years of life. 1 We exploit anthropometric measurements taken from children born between 1988 and 2012 in Jamaica along with geocoded information of tropical storms occurred during their pregnancy periods.\nThis paper is related to the literature on the socioeconomic effects of natural disasters like hurricanes and earthquakes studied by Baez and Santos, 2007, who using household data from Nicaragua and a difference in differences method exploiting exogenous variation of Hurricane Mitch's trajectory, find that hurricanes reduce access to health care in the medium term. Caruso and Miller, 2015 , using data from Peru's census, exploited variation from an earthquake and found that adults who were affected when they were in utero attain less years of schooling than those who were not affected. Currie and Rossin-Slater, 2013 , using birth certificate data from Texas, exploited exogenous variation from the trajectory of hurricanes and found a negative effect of these events on new born outcomes such as delivery complications and time in an incubator after birth. Frankenberg, et. al, 2013 used a very detailed survey data on children conducted before and after the tsunami in Indonesia to study the response of children's height to the shock and found a heterogeneous effect at the time of the event. Hoddinott and Kinsey, 2001 using household panel data from Zimbabwe and exploiting variation from a larger-than-average drought the found that children exposed to the event have negative growth outcomes on height. Imberman, Kugler, and Sacerdote, 2012 , using data at the individual level from education institutions, exploited variation from hurricanes Sandy and Katrina and found a negative effect on school performance in the aftermath of the event. Sotomayor, 2013, using data from health conditions and exploiting variation from hurricanes and tropical storms between 1920 and 1940, found negative effects on health conditions such as high blood pressure associated with exposure to the events when they were in utero. Our study is also related to several papers that explore the effects on children's outcomes as a result of different situations experienced while they were in utero. See Case, Lubotsky, and Paxson (2002) , Gutierrez (2013) , and Kiernan and Huerta (2008) for events related to economic hardship. Using panel data, they found that adult's heath was negatively affected by differences in levels of income and wealth and economic crisis when exposed to these shocks during infancy; Lewis et al. (2014) study the effects of exposure to alcohol in-utero using panel data from the UK; and Schultz-Nielsen et al. (2014) study how nutritional deficiency during gestation due to the Ramadan caused negative effects on adult's labor outcomes. More generally, our study is related to the set of studies exploring the medium-and long-term consequences of shocks suffered during early stages of development. Almond and Currie (2011) and Almond, Currie, and Duque (2017) provide comprehensive reviews of these studies. The common factor in the literature is that stressful events suffered during early stages of development generate negative impacts over the short, medium, and long term.\nA strand of this literature focuses on the stress suffered by expectant mothers and its effect on in-utero development. Ag\u00fcero (2014) and Hu and Li (2016) investigate the effects of high temperatures on birth weight and adult height using data from cross section household data from Mexico and China, respectively; Almond and Mazumder (2011) study the effects of nutritional deprivation during Ramadan on birth weight using microdata from Michigan in the USA and census data from Uganda and Iraq. Camacho (2008) studies the effects of acts of terrorism (as a source of maternal stress during pregnancy) on birth weight; and Lavy, Schlosser, and Shany (2016) focus on stressful migration episodes.\nOverall, these studies find negative effects that could last throughout the children's lives. Glynn et al. (2001) conducted a study on how natural disasters like earthquakes create negative conditions for a normal fetus' development using data from California. The authors claim that stress suffered due to the impact of this kind of event has a worse effect at the beginning of gestation; this negative effect will decrease as gestation advances, since psychologically, mothers become increasingly resilient to hardships.\nWe contribute to the international literature investigating the effects of tropical storms and hurricanes suffered during pregnancy on early childhood physical development. Our strategy allows an exploration of the possibility of nonlinear effects with respect to the intensity of the destruction suffered during pregnancy. To do so, we use all storms that affected the North Atlantic region between 1987 and 2012. These include hurricanes between categories 1 and 2 and tropical storms (which are weaker than hurricanes but are accompanied by more precipitation). To our knowledge, this is the first study exploring these issues in a country in the Caribbean, a region that is exposed to recurrent weather shocks.\nOur findings suggest that expectant mothers living in coastal-rural areas exposed to an average of at least two hurricanes during their second trimester of gestation are 56\npercentage points more likely to deliver a baby with low birth weight (i.e., below 2.5 kg).\nIn addition, this exposure during the third trimester of gestation causes a reduction in children's weight-for-age (weight-for-height) measured within the first five years of life, equivalent to 1.88 (1.4) standard deviations. Considering the well-documented deleterious effects of low birth weight on educational and labour market outcomes (Black, Devereux, and Salvanes, 2007; Currie and Moretti, 2007; Oreopoulos et. al, 2008; and Royer, 2009) our findings highlight the importance of having appropriate safety nets in place to assist expectant mothers who experience such events. Taking the findings in Black, Devereux, and Salvanes (2007) as a benchmark, our estimates imply that Jamaican children exposed to two or more hurricanes during their mother's pregnancy will be 2.76 percent less likely to graduate from high school, will have 2.76 percent lower IQ (for boys), and will have 2.07 percent lower earnings in adulthood compared to similar children who did not experience these shocks while in utero.\nThe remainder of the document is organised as follows. Section 2 provides a brief background on the Jamaican economy. Section 3 describes the data, while Section 4\nshows the construction of the destruction measures based on the storms' physical characteristics. The empirical strategy is developed in Section 5. Results are discussed in Section 6, Section 7 analyses the robustness of our results, and Section 8 concludes."}, {"section_title": "Country Background", "text": "With a population of 2.7 million and a per capita GDP of US$8,872, Jamaica is a middle- 1996-98, 2008-10, and 2012. Unemployment over the whole period averaged 13.5 percent, peaking at 16.5 percent in 1997 and falling below 10 percent only in 2006 and 2007 (9.6 and 9.4 percent, respectively) . The headcount ratio of poverty declined from a peak of over 40 percent in 1991 to 9.9 percent in 2007. The recession accompanying the world economic downturn led to a renewed increase in poverty to 19.9 percent in 2012, which fell slightly to 18.7 percent in 2016.\nJamaica's economy is highly dependent on services, particularly tourism, for which the country is famous. The contribution of agriculture to total GDP has been low for an extended period, at 8.3 percent in the 1990s, further declining to 6.8 percent by 2012.\nOver the same period, industry's contribution to GDP declined from 37 to 21 percent of total GDP, while services increased from 55 to over 70 percent.\nAgriculture remains an important sector, however, as it employs a disproportionate share of the labour force, especially in rural areas. In 2012, agriculture employed on average 16.7 percent of the classifiable workforce, second only to wholesale and retail repair of motor vehicle and equipment, which averaged 20 percent."}, {"section_title": "The Data", "text": "The data for our study are derived from two sources. First, we use yearly rounds of Jamaica's Survey of Living Conditions (SLC) from 1993 to 2012. 3 The SLC is a nationally representative survey executed every year on a sub-sample of households interviewed in the second quarter of the Labour Force Survey (the \"April LFS\"). The SLC contains information on individuals' sociodemographic characteristics, district of residence, and a detailed module for children under 5 which collects birth weight, anthropometric measurements, and vaccination status. 4 Appendix 1 contains detailed descriptions of the LFS and the SLC designs.\nUsing the SLC collected data on height, weight, age, and the World Health Organization (WHO) z-scores tables, we calculated standardised measures of weight-forheight, weight-for-age, and height-for-age. The total sample size is roughly 14,000 children under 60 months of age after selecting only individuals with standardised scores between -5 and 5. Of these, 2,569 reside in the coastal-rural region.\nTropical storms particularly affect households located in the coastal-rural region in two ways. First, poverty rates are higher in rural areas, and second, proximity to the coast makes them particularly vulnerable to storms coming from the ocean. Their lack of consumption-smoothing mechanisms (precautionary savings and/or access to sources of finance), coupled with their dependence on natural resources, generate an increasing exposure to risk and an inability to cope with it, as Hallagate et al. (2015) suggest. Table 1 presents descriptive statistics for both the complete and the coastal-rural samples. The coastal-rural area differs from the complete sample in some respects.\nChildren from the coastal-rural area live in households with fewer members and with heads who are less likely to have tertiary education. In terms of outcomes, while the average birth weight of children living in the coastal-rural area is similar to that of the full sample, the incidence of low birth weight is higher in coastal-rural areas. Children in Jamaica show average anthropometric z-scores of approximately 0.20 standard deviations higher that the international WHO benchmarks. However, the complete sample has higher weight-for-height (ZWH) and lower height-for-age (ZWA) than children living in coastal-rural areas. Vaccination rates of children residing in coastal-rural areas and the full sample are equivalent.\nOur second data source is the International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS), managed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). This dataset contains information on every storm occurred between 1969 and 2014, including date, trajectory, maximum sustained wind, radius of maximum speed, and minimum central pressure. This information is collected every six hours during the storm's lifespan and will be used to build the wind field model that is the basis for the calculation of destruction measures. Appendix Table 1 shows the dates of the storms included in our analyses, the maximum wind speed, and the category of the storm (Saffir-Simpson Scale). Appendix Figure 1 .a shows the distribution over the space of the storms studied and Appendix Figure 1 .b shows a satellite photograph of hurricane Ivan in 2004 while approaching to the island. 5 The sample is comprised of storms that are at maximum 500 Km from the island's coast since the potential diameter of the storm can reach 1000 Km, as in the photograph."}, {"section_title": "Wind Field Model and Storm Destruction Measure", "text": "Following Strobl (2012), who based his analysis on Boose, Serrano, and Foster (2004) ,\nwe calculated an approximation of the storms' local wind speed in every district in Jamaica.\nThe wind field model is based on the model suggested by Holland (1980) for cyclostrophic wind and sustained wind speed as follows:\nwhere , , is the estimate of storm s wind speed, in district d, within a time interval r. G is the gust factor, F is the surface friction, Vm is the maximum sustained wind velocity that the storm reaches at any point, S is the asymmetry due to forward motion of the storm, is the clockwise angle between the storm's forward path and the ray between the storm's center and the district's centroid d, Vh is the forward storm's speed, Rm is the radius of maximum winds, Rd is the length of the ray that connects the storm's center and the district's centroid d, and B is the shape of the wind profile curve-scaling parameter."}, {"section_title": "6", "text": "From this point on, we diverge from the Strobl (2012) destruction measure. The author proposes an index that uses a set of weights to consider local characteristics such as population growth. Unlike Strobl (2012), we are not interested in approximating a destruction measure at the national level, since we are exploiting variation at the district level. Therefore, we calculate the destruction measure at the district level as follows:\n5 https://visibleearth.nasa.gov/view.php?id=71977 6 F, S, and B parameters were taken from Strobl (2012) and Boose, Serrano, and Foster (2004) . "}, {"section_title": "Empirical Strategy", "text": "Our main question is whether environmental conditions suffered during gestation periods affect children's physical development within their first five years of life. To disentangle causality between environmental shocks and health outcomes, we use a destruction variable created from the storms' physical characteristics (wind speed, distance to district, trajectory, etc.), that are random and exogenous events in intensity, trajectory, and life span. We define the outcome variables as standardised versions (using WHO tables) of anthropometric measurements such as weight-for-height, weight-for-age, and height-forage as well as birth weight (in kg) and the likelihood of being born with low birth weight (below 2.5 kg).\nFollowing Dell, Olken, and Jones (2014) , the main econometric model is as follows:\nwhere Following the literature and the continuous nature of treatment, we allow a nonlinear relationship between the destruction measure and the outcomes of interest.\nMaccini and Yang (2009) found a positive relationship between rainfall and some welfarerelated outcomes when evaluating the effect of that shock on the first year of life. When the shock is large, like the terrorist attacks studied by Camacho (2008) , the effect is negative. However, when the event is of much higher magnitude, like the tsunami in Indonesia studied by Frankenberg, Friedman, and Ingwersen (2013) , the effect of the aid received in the aftermath of the event could push the outcome variable up, given that aid may offset the negative impact of the event. Therefore, to capture the potential nonlinearity of effects, we consider a third-degree polynomial of the destruction measure.\nAn important aspect of this model is the necessity of treatment variation within the same cohorts. Following Cummins (2015) , there is a potential bias that affects estimation when cross-sectional data are used to estimate effects of certain treatments that are applied at the cohort level. The problem relies on the potential unobserved relation between treatment exposure and age-at-measurement within the same cohort. The author claims that this bias can potentially be avoided if there is variation in treatment intensity within the same cohort so that it is possible to disentangle the cohort effect from the treatment effect. As mentioned before, variation of district-level destruction measures within the same cohorts allows us to distinguish storm effects form cohort effects.\nPotential sources of bias could arise from selection and migration. It is possible that parents self-select to give birth in the first six months of the year, when there are usually no storms. The second source of selection bias is the potential effect of storms on survival rates such that the resulting observed sample comprises individuals with different potential outcomes than those who were not observed because they died before the survey date. The third source of selection bias is potential migration due to storms. The final source is the assumption that the district of birth was equivalent to the district where the mothers lived during pregnancy. If the mother's location during pregnancy was different from the place of birth used to impute the district-level destruction measures, then our results could be biased. We show that our strategy and results are robust to all these potential identification threats in Section 7."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "Our results not only report point estimates, but also primarily explore the existence of heterogeneous effects with respect to the intensity of exposure. To do so, we evaluate the cubic polynomial of the estimated impact parameters from model (3) at different values of the destruction measure received within each trimester of gestation. As such, potential nonlinear relationships between total exposure to storms and outcomes of interest are presented.\nThe most common weather events in the Caribbean are tropical depressions and storms. Within our study period, 75 percent of the events were either depressions or storms. These events are less destructive than hurricanes in terms of wind power and gust factor. Tropical storms and depressions are characterised by an increase in rainfall but generally do not cause serious damage to crop production or road infrastructure.\nOur study period also contains some of the most destructive events ever registered "}, {"section_title": "Effects of Tropical Storms", "text": "We start assessing the estimated impacts of the average tropical storm (excluding hurricanes) that occurred within each trimester of gestation. Table 2 shows the estimated impacts for the full national sample suggesting the absence of effects. However, when focusing on the coastal-rural population in Table 3 , we observe some mild positive effects of storms occurring during the second trimester of pregnancy equivalent to 0.04 kg in birth weight but no effects on the likelihood of low birth weight. In addition, we also observe positive effects on both ZWH and ZWA standardised scores measured within the first 60 months of life. These are equivalent to 0.08 (0.07) and 0.06 (0.06) standard deviations in ZWH (ZWA) following storms experienced within the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, respectively.\nTherefore, we observe some positive effects when children are hit by tropical storms in their second and third trimesters of gestation. This suggests that, when exposed to events low in power (like tropical depressions), some benefits could come with the extra rainfall fostering agricultural output. This could be translated into improved nutrition during pregnancy (either through an income or own production effect). However, the lack of data prevents us from testing and disentangling these possible transmission channels directly. 10 The next section will show some indirect evidence on this probable transmission channel."}, {"section_title": "Effects of an Average Hurricane", "text": "In this section, we document the estimated effects of an average storm that included one hurricane. Table 4 shows the estimated effects for the full national sample suggesting no discernible impacts. However, when focusing on the coastal-rural sample in Table 5, estimates suggest some positive effects of being exposed to an average hurricane during the second trimester of gestation. These effects are equivalent to 0.35 kg in birth weight, 0.91 standard deviations in ZWH, and 0.79 standard deviations in ZWA.\nWhile these results may appear to be counterintuitive, the accumulated destructive power of an average storm including one hurricane falls below the mean of the destructive power distribution of all storms observed in the study period. Figures 1 to 3 show the estimated effects of the storms' destructive power experienced during each trimester of gestation on the outcomes of interest. The point estimates shown in Table 5 correspond to the second vertical line in the figures. Therefore, the destructive power of an average hurricane is not yet an extremely destructive event. As such, the few positive effects observed could be in line with the positive effects associated with increased rainfall and agricultural output."}, {"section_title": "Effects of Destructive Hurricanes", "text": "The study also focused on the effects of storms that included two or more hurricanes. Table 6 shows full-sample estimated effects associated with destruction measures equivalent to an average storm that included at least two hurricanes. While impacts on birth weight are negative in sign, they are imprecisely estimated. However, we observe significant impacts, suggesting an increased likelihood of the occurrence of low birth\nweight. It appears that pregnant women exposed to these events during their second (third) trimester increase the likelihood of delivering a baby with low birth weight by 20 (17) percentage points. These estimated effects are twice as large as the overall mean of an 8 percent incidence of low birth weight (reported in Table 1 ).\nWhen focusing on the coastal-rural sample (Table 7) , estimated effects are larger.\nThe estimated impacts on birth weight are negative, around 0.7 kg for the first and second trimesters (although imprecisely estimated for the second trimester). These findings are consistent with Camacho (2008) , where birth weight effects rose when exposed to shocks during the first and second trimesters of gestation. However, our results are larger. While\nCamacho (2008) estimated a reduction in birth weight of 11.6 grams when exposed to land mines in the second trimester of gestation, our estimate finds a reduction of 730 grams. 11 In addition, we find that the likelihood of delivering a low-birth-weight baby increases by 56 percentage points if the storm is experienced during the second trimester of gestation (effect equivalent of 5 times the overall mean of 11 percent for the coastalrural area).\nThe negative effects on birth weight are particularly relevant, as previous literature has documented a long-term negative impact of lower birth weight on educational and labour market outcomes (Black, Devereux, and Salvanes, 2007; Currie and Moretti, 2007; Oreopoulos et al., 2008; Royer, 2009 ). For example, taking the findings in Black, Devereux, and Salvanes (2007) as a benchmark, our estimates imply that Jamaican children exposed to two or more hurricanes during the mother's pregnancy will be 2.76 percent less likely to graduate from high school, will have 2.76 percent lower IQ (for boys), and will have 2.07 percent lower adult earnings when compared to similar children who did not experience these shocks while in utero. Therefore, our findings highlight the importance of having appropriate safety nets in place to assist expectant mothers experiencing such events.\nRegarding ZWH, we find negative effects equivalent to 1.4 standard deviations due to experiencing the storm during the third trimester of gestation. Compared to Baez and Santos (2007) , who studied the effects of hurricane Mitch in Nicaragua, our result is almost three times larger than their estimate of 0.493 of a standard deviation in ZWH.\nIn contrast with ZWH, ZWA is a longer-term outcome since it is more difficult to be improved with better subsequent nutrition than ZWH. We observe a negative effect equivalent to 1.88 standard deviations in ZWA due to experiencing the storm within the third trimester of gestation. Compared with that of Kumar, Molitor and Vollmer (2014) , our estimate is 12 times larger with respect to the negative documented effect of droughts on ZWA in India."}, {"section_title": "12", "text": "The previous estimates correspond to the third vertical line in Figures 1 to 3. As these figures show, the relationship between the destructive power of the storms and the outcomes of interest is nonlinear. In general, we observe that the effects begin from zero to slightly positive when storms are in the left tail of the destructive power. However, as the destructive power of storms increase, the effects on the outcomes of interest turn negative (with some flattening out and even turning to positive effects for extremely destructive events on the right tail of the distribution).\nThe nonlinearity of the effects and the flattening of the curves for extremely catastrophic events are consistent with Frankenberg, Friedman, and Ingwersen (2013) . In this study, the authors find a positive effect of the tsunami on children's height, suggesting that this class of extreme events could come with \"massive influx of humanitarian aid and the accompanying resources following the tsunami.\" (Frank, Friedman, and Ingwersen, 2013: page 12) . This behaviour could push outcome variables up since food intake could increase and, in some cases, improve.\nThe effects that we document are likely lower bounds due to measurement error.\nOur destruction measure was built using data from the six-hour interval records from NOAA archives. This is the smallest time interval available and, therefore, the exact path followed by the storm at each stage of its life cannot be exactly recreated. In addition, the measure of total exposure by an individual is calculated using the geometric distance between the storm and the centroid of the district of residency, which is not the exact location of residency. Despite these limitations, our results are robust to several sources of possible biases, as we show in the next section."}, {"section_title": "Robustness Analysis and Theory of Change.", "text": "We think that our results are driven by the variation in access to proper nutrients intake.\nWe test this hypothesis using data from districts' geographic size and the road network of Jamaica. With these variables, we divide the sample by size of the district (small, medium, and large) and also by the level of road density (a measure that takes into account the number of roads within the district). We found that the effects are stronger when tested in sample living in small districts and where the road density is high. We also find that the estimated impacts are weaker in districts of large size and low connectivity. Our strategy faces several potential sources of bias. This section shows that our results are robust to them. First, parents could self-select the time of conception and, therefore, 13 We observe in the data that the smaller districts are the ones with larger connectivity. 14 The figures for this analysis will be available upon request to the authors. Second, if our strategy resembles a good source of exogenous variation, we should not observe a systematic relation between our destruction measure and characteristics that could be related with the outcomes of interest. To test for this, we run model (3) using the sociodemographic characteristics of household heads as outcomes.\nAs can be seen in Appendix Table 2 , out of 117 estimated parameters, only seven (or 6 percent) were statistically significant at the 10 percent level or lower. This provides further confidence on the conditional exogeneity of the destruction measure within our empirical strategy.\nThird, although women may not choose to give birth purposely in the non-storm season, they could adapt to climatic conditions. Adaptation to storms could potentially ameliorate the estimated effects. Therefore, to test if women are adapting, we created an indicator for wall quality that equals one if wall material is brick, concrete nog, or concrete, while zero otherwise. We then aggregated the destruction that the district where the household resides suffered in the 12 months preceding the survey date. We then estimated model (3) using this indicator as an outcome. Appendix Table 3 shows that exposure to storms within the previous 12 months do not affect the wall materials.\nTherefore, we interpret this as weak evidence of infrastructure adaptation mechanisms.\nFourth, as in Maccini and Yang (2009) , selection in the sample of children due to differential survival might bias the results. This would arise if the most affected children had died before being surveyed and, therefore, the observed children would be an already selected sample of relatively stronger people. To test if selection is present, we show that tropical storms have no relationship with the children's likelihood of appearing in the survey. That is, we find null relationship between the storms' strength and the size of birth cohorts by district-year-season (results available upon request).\nFifth, if our results are real and are not simply reflecting a random occurrence, there should not be any relationship between our outcomes and storms not yet suffered.\nTo test for this, we regress the outcome variables on future storms (two and three years after the real gestation period) as if they had occurred during the gestation period.\nAppendix Tables 4-6 show that less than 10 percent of all estimated parameters in these placebo tests were statistically significant at the 10 percent level or lower. 16 This provides further confidence that our results are not just driven by random chance. In addition, using data from the Population Census of Jamaica in 2001 and 2011, we found that migration across parishes for children under 5 is low. In 2001, the percentage of children under 5 who were born in a different parish than the current parish of residency was 9 percent, for children under 4 it was 8.4 percent, for children under 3 it was 7.7 percent, for children under 2 it was 6.8 percent, and for children under one year old it was 5.7 percent. The figures from the 2011 census were 8.45 percent, 7.9 percent, 7.2 percent, 6.3 percent, and 5.3 percent, respectively.\nFinally, it could be that our results were not the effects of storms suffered during pregnancy, but rather a reflection of the presence (or absence) of interventions that would have responded to storms in post-pregnancy periods. For example, if the advent of a storm during pregnancy had triggered a scarcity of vaccinations received within the first moments of life, then our results in terms of anthropometric measurements could be reflecting this. To test for this, we estimate model (3) having an indicator for whether the child received the bacille Calmette-Guerin (bcg) vaccination that is supposed to be received at birth. The results (available upon request) were all insignificant, suggesting that this channel is unlikely to be pervasive."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "We studied the effects of tropical storms and hurricanes experienced during pregnancy on birth weight and children's physical development within the first 60 months of life. Using (ii) A medium to large event would generate stress to pregnant mothers and/or malnourishment due to infrastructure destruction and/or loss of agricultural output, creating an adverse environment for normal fetal development (Camacho, 2008) . This is reflected in the negative effects that we document for events related to the combination of two average hurricanes. (iii) A boost in public expenditure and an increase in aid and humanitarian relief funds in the aftermath of an unusually catastrophic event may increase nutrition intake immediately after the storm (Frankenberg, Friedman, and Ingwersen, 2013 From a policy perspective, our findings suggest harmful effects of negative shocks suffered in utero on birth weight and early physical development, which have been shown to be correlated in the longer term with adult productivity. Therefore, our results provide additional objective justification for considering policies aimed at protecting expectant mothers at risk of suffering environmental shocks. Policy options toward effectively coping with these risks include weather insurance schemes, food security policies, community bounding strategies, and initiatives that promote resilience and adaptability to climate change, among others.\nBeyond our specific results, poverty-related vulnerability will likely increase the potential negative effects of storms. Hallagate et al. (2015) suggest that economic vulnerabilities might create more pronounced poverty traps due to climate change since the poor will not have enough tools to cope with this risk. 19 Informal settlements, insecure sources of income, and inadequate formal insurance will make it impossible for this population to overcome the negative effects of environmental shocks. Public policy discussions on unemployment insurance, improving access to public health and pregnancy checkups, and boosting conditional cash transfer programs could be a good start to think about precautionary measures to confront weather shocks of the magnitude studied in this paper. 18 Recently, a discussion by the Geophysical Fluid Dynamic Laboratory, a division of NOAA, has affirmed the existence of a relationship between global warming and the potential increase of stronger cyclones by the end of the century. This will become a clear relationship between climate change and the increase in the risk due to weather shocks. 19 The document is open to access and can be downloaded from https://openknowledge.
