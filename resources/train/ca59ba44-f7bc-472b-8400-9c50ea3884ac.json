[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Manifold learning techniques have been widely used to produce low-dimensional representations of patient brain magnetic resonance (MR) images. Diagnosis classifiers trained on these coordinates attempt to separate healthy, mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease patients. The performance of such classifiers can be improved by incorporating clinical data available in most large-scale clinical studies. However, the standard non-linear dimensionality reduction algorithms cannot be applied directly to imaging and clinical data. In this paper, we introduce a novel extension of Laplacian Eigenmaps that allow the computation of manifolds while combining imaging and clinical data. This method is a distance-based extension that suits better continuous clinical variables than the existing graph-based extension, which is suitable for clinical variables in finite discrete spaces. These methods were evaluated in terms of classification accuracy using 288 MR images and clinical data (ApoE genotypes, A\u03b2 42 concentrations and mini-mental state exam (MMSE) cognitive scores) of patients enrolled in the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) study."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Large scale population studies aim to improve the understanding of the causes of diseases, define biomarkers for early diagnosis, and develop preventive treatments. In the context of the Alzheimer's disease (AD), imaging biomarkers, blood biomarkers, cognitive tests, lifestyle and diet biomarkers are all potential sources of information to diagnose the disease as early as possible.\nManifold learning techniques have been used to analyse trends in populations and describe the space of brain images by a low-dimensional non-linear manifold [1, 2] . These studies attempt to describe the space of brain images via a lowdimensional manifold while capturing relevant information with regard to disease diagnosis. Diagnosis classifiers trained on the low-dimension coordinates evaluate the ability to capture this information and separate healthy, mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's patients [2] .\nAs most of the current large-scale clinical studies also provide non-imaging information, one would want to be able to use this information to improve the diagnosis classification. However, as the imaging and clinical data are in different spaces, the non-linear dimensionality reduction cannot be applied directly and must be adapted. We introduce a distancebased extension and compare it theoretically to an exisiting graph-based extension [2] .

This extension adds two constraints to the original algorithm: 1) the need for a distance on the clinical data and 2) the need to define a weight for the clinical data. Combining the two distance matrices and applying LEM creates a graph with the same nodes but different edges and weight\u015d w ij ( Fig. 2a and 2b ). Using this extension, the optimisation problem becomes:"}, {"section_title": "Extended LEM based on adjacency graph extension", "text": "An alternative method to combine imaging and clinical data is to extend the adjacency graph by adding extra nodes and edges. One such technique has been presented in [2] . This extension also adds two constraints to the original algorithm: 1) a set of rules to extend the graph (extra nodes and extra weights), 2) the need to define a weight for the clinical data.\nWhen the clinical variable is in a discrete finite space, such as for ApoE genotype, one node is created for each element of that space. Extra edges are created (with a weight equal to one) between the node of each patient with a particular element to the node of that element (e.g. all the patients with a particular genotype are connected to the node representing that genotype). When the clinical variable is in a continuous space, such as A\u03b2 42 concentration or MMSE clinical score, Wolz et al. proposed to partition this continuous space and set the weights as the fuzzy probabilities of belonging to each partition:\nwhere d is a distance on the space of clinical variable, the z k are the means of the sub-intervals defined using the mininum, maximum and several percentile values. Figure 2c represents the extended graph, which corresponding matrix is writte\u00f1\nwhere I is the identity matrix, W is the weight matrix of the standard LEM on images, and C contains the weights of the extra-edges. A parameter \u03b3 is introduced to weight the clinical data versus the imaging data. When extending the graph by\u00f1 nodes, we are now looking for Y = ( 2 , 3 , 4 ) , and since each individual carries two alleles, six ApoE genotypes are possible. The 4 allele has been shown to increase the risk of developing AD, whereas 2 decreases this risk [5] . Moreover an A\u03b2 42 protein analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is provided. A decrease in the concentration of this protein has been shown to be associated with a development of AD [3] .

All the images were then rigidly registered to the atlas using [7] . Sub-images around the hippocampus were finally extracted. A deformation based distance of this area was used for the image distance matrix. The ApoE genotype was used considering all possible pairs of alleles and considering ApoE carriers as in [2] , respectively leading to 6 and 3 extra nodes in the graph-based extension. For the graph-based extension with the continuous clinical variables (A\u03b2 42 and MMSE), 3 extra nodes were added as in [2] . Adjacency graphs were k-nearest neighbour graphs (k = 100) with edges weights computed using the gaussian kernel with a kernel width equal to the standard deviation of the distance matrix coefficients. LEM was applied with target dimension from 2 to 100. The classifiers used were k-nearest neighbour classifiers (k = 50). Training set and test sets were built using a leave 5% out scheme. The optimal target dimension in LEM and optimal \u03bb (resp. \u03b3) were automatically selected from a 20-cross validation on the training set on {1, . . . , 100}\u00d7{0.1, 1, 2, 5, 10, 25} (resp. {1, . . . , 100} \u00d7 {0.01, 0.01, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 25}). Table 2 presents the classification performance of the standard LEM algorithm using the imaging data, and the two extensions using the combined imaging and clinical data. Using clinical data combined with imaging data improves classification results for both methods compared to the standard LEM on only imaging data. For the discrete clinical variable ApoE genotype, the two extensions have similar performance on this dataset. For the continuous clinical variables A\u03b2 24 CSF concentration and MMSE cognitive score, the distance-based extension performs better than the graph-based extension."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "We have presented two extensions of LEM able to perform non-linear dimensionality reduction with data from different spaces, such as imaging and clinical data. Both methods come with two additional constraints. In particular, they both need to set an extra parameter to balance how much weight is given to the clinical information versus the weight of the imaging information.\nFrom a theoretical point of view, the graph-based extension seems more natural when the clinical variable is in a finite discrete space, whereas the distance based extension seems more natural when the clinical data lives in a continuous space. First, when the clinical variable's space is a finite discrete space, it is easy to add one node per possible value and edges with weights equal to one for class memberships. However, using the distance-based extension when the clinical variable is in a discrete space requires to define a distance on that space. Depending on the problem, this can raise difficult questions. In the case of the ApoE genotype, we can for example wonder if creating a distance being equal to one between all pairs of different genotypes is really optimal. Having d(( 2 , 2 ), ( 4 , 4 )) higher than d (( 2 , 2 ), ( 2 , 3 ) ) would not be absurd given the known biological impact of the ApoE alleles [5] . This example illustrates that the distance-based extension is not necessarily well suited for discrete clinical variables. On the other hand, when the clinical variable lives in a continuous space such as R n , many distances are commonly associated (e.g. distances from l p norms x p = ( i x i p ) 1/p ). However, if one wants to use the graph extension technique, it is obviously impossible to add an infinite number of nodes. So the continous space has to be discretized into a finite number of subparts. At this point, using memberships to these subparts would mean that each z value would be considered as being one of the z k . To avoid this huge loss of information, Wolz et al. introduced fuzzy memberships. Nonetheless, there is no natural way to select the number of elements of the partition. In their paper, Wolz et al. have a clinical variable in z \u2208 R, they add\u00f1 = 3 extra nodes, and the weights were defined by the minimum of z, its 33% and 67% percentiles and its maximum value, but this choice is rather arbitrary. From a numerical point of view, when the graph-based LEM extension is used with a continuous clinical variable, the divisions in the c ik can be sources of numerical instability.

This distance-based extension leads to a graph with the same nodes as from the standard LEM but with different edges and weights, whereas the previously existing graph-based extension leads to a graph where all the nodes and edges from the standard LEM are kept and extra ones are created. This new distance-based extension is better suited for a continuous clinical data than the graph-based which is well-suited when the clinical variable lives in a finite discrete space.\nWe have shown that both extensions improve the numerical classification performance compared to the original LEM on a large dataset from ADNI. Performances of both extensions are similar with the discrete ApoE genotype clinical value, and our new distance-based extension have higher classification accuracy with the continuous clinical variables A\u03b2 42 CSF concentrations and MMSE clinical scores.\nIn terms of generalization of the two extensions to other dimensionality reduction algorithms, the existing graphbased extension can potentially be adapted only if the dimensionality reduction process is based on a graph. Our new distance-based extension is more general and can be directly used in any dimensionality reduction algorithm that requires a distance of pairwise distances between all objects as input."}]
