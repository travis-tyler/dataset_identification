[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract: This paper proposes that atherosclerosis is initiated by a signaling event that deposits calcium hydroxyapatite (Ca-HAP). This event is preceded by a loss of mechanical structure in the arterial wall. After Ca-HAP has been deposited, it is unlikely that it will be reabsorbed because the solubility product constant (K sp ) is very small, and the large stores of Ca ) ions, and it is proposed that anions associated with cholesterol ester hydrolysis and, in very small quantities, the enolate of 7-ketocholesterol could also displace the OH \u2212 of Ca-HAP, forming an ionic bond. The free energy of hydration of Ca-HAP at 310 K is most likely negative, and the ionic radii of the anions associated with the hydrolysis of cholesterol ester are compatible with the substitution. Furthermore, examination of the pathology of atherosclerotic lesions by Raman and NMR spectroscopy and confocal microscopy supports deposition of Ca-HAP associated with cholesterol. Investigating the affinity of intermediates of cholesterol hydrolysis for Ca-HAP compared to lipoproteins such as HDL, LDL, and VLDL using isothermic titration calorimetry could add proof of this concept and may lead to the development of a new class of medications targeted at the deposition of cholesterol within Ca-HAP. Treatment of acute ischemic events as a consequence of atherosclerosis with denitrogenation and oxygenation is discussed."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "All living organisms must possess structure to separate themselves from their surroundings. Plants use cellulose, bacteria have a cell wall, invertebrates have calcium carbonate shells, and vertebrates have skeletons of primarily calcium hydroxyapatite Ca 5 (PO 4 ) 3 OH (Ca-HAP). In humans, Ca-HAP is deposited within a matrix that is responsive to the stress demands on the bone (Wolff's Law). 1, 2 However, the deposition of Ca-HAP is not exclusive to bone. The process also occurs in muscle, neural tissue, granulomas, neoplasms, cardiac valves, and many other tissues. One proposal of this paper is that deposition of Ca-HAP is a response of the organism to mechanical stress and/or the need to provide structure to form a partition within the tissues.\nevidence to support the proposition that ca-HAp Deposition Occurs Throughout the Human Body Because of structural needs 1 .

Osteoarthritis is characterized by depositions of Ca-HAP that is commonly associated with structural deterioration of the joint from trauma and loss of cartilage. 4 4. Pancreatic, granulomatous and neoplastic diseases develop partitions of calcium within the tissue to possibly separate disease and non-disease zones (Fig. 3 ).\n6"}, {"section_title": "Deposition of ca-HAp in Arterial Vessels as a Response to Mechanical stress", "text": "In humans, calcification can occur in the intima, media, and, uncommonly, in the adventitial layers of the artery. It is probable that local factors influence where the Ca-HAP deposition occurs, and this may be related to the efficiency of structural reinforcement.\n1. The arteries most commonly associated with severe disease include the carotid, aortic, superficial femoral and coronary, many of which are associated with lengths of low shear stress in the vicinity of a bifurcation. 7 As has been demonstrated in coronary bifurcations, plaque in these low shear stress areas exhibit a higher proportion of dense calcium and lower proportion fibrous tissue consistent with the need to provide structural support by the deposition of Ca-HAP. 8 2. Arteries from organs associated with extremely high blood flow compared to tissue mass such as the kidney and pineal gland are also frequently calcified. In addition to the high flow, the weak capillary structure of the pineal gland may account for pineal calcification in 70% of adults along with accumulation of fluoride (Fig. 4) . [9] [10] [11] 3. Arteries and arterioles of diabetic patients may have abnormal vascular tone caused by augmentation of Ca +2 sparklet activity from hyperglycemia. This elevation in Ca +2 sparklet activitiy is associated with an increase in vascular tone producing resistance stress on the vessels. 14, 15 This may account for the more diffuse findings of calcium deposition in their arterial vessels in addition to deposition in critical low shear stress vessels. 4. Hypertension either essential or secondary to renal disease, endocrine disorders (pheochromocytoma or Cushing's disease), or vasoconstriction from rheumatic disease such as rheumatoid arthritis, Raynaud's disease or phenomenon and systemic sclerosis produces resistance stress on the arterial wall predisposing to arterial calcification. 16, 17 5. Hypertension from medications or toxins such as cigarette smoke produces chronic changes in vascular resistance increasing the stress on the arterial wall."}, {"section_title": "18", "text": "Although not exhaustive, the above examples provide evidence that Ca-HAP is a key compound providing structure throughout the body and that deposition is not a stochastic event but rather related to mechanical forces coupled with a signaled response to reinforce the arterial wall."}, {"section_title": "evidence that Genetic expression causes Deposition of ca-HAp", "text": "The signals that initiate Ca-HAP are not well understood, but the genetic expression is probably present in many cell types as observed in idiopathic nonarterioscelerotic cerebral calcification, Fahr's disease, characterized by diffuse hereditary depositions of calcium in the brain usually in the regions of the basal ganglia, cerebellum and sometimes also found in the putamen, caudate nucleus, thalamus and white matter. This condition was first described by Karl Theodor Fahr in 1930, is usually progressive and associated with dementia, psychosis, movement disorders, pyramidal signs, and frontal lobe and cerebellar dysfunction. The analysis of brain tissue reveals that the calcium is primarily in the form of CA-HAP and the calcification process does not originate from the blood vessels. "}, {"section_title": "12,13", "text": "Therefore Ca-HAP can be, but is not usually, deposited in tissues not subjected to mechanical stress or requiring a partition (Fig. 5) .\nOther genetic causes of Ca-HAP deposition include the ACDC condition and idiopathic infantile arterial calcification, both of which affect the arteries (Fig. 6) . 21 In the ACDC condition, or arterial calcification due to CD73 deficiency individuals with ACDC have calcium buildup in their arteries below the waist and in the joints of their hands and feet, but not in the arteries of their heart. Affected individuals can experience claudication. 22 In idiopathic infantile arterial calcification the calcium deposits have been shown to be Ca-HAP. 23 In addition to the structural argument presented in this paper, various mechanisms have been proposed to explain the deposition of Ca-HAP in the arterials vessels, including:\n1. A response to endothelial inflammation 24 2. Metabolic changes related to calcium and phosphate concentrations 24 3. Chemical mediation from osteopontin, vitamin D, or other promoters, or lack of inhibitors of mineralization 25, 26 4. Cellular mechanisms from osteoblastic activity. 27 Clinical and laboratory evidence to support the hypothesis that deposition of Ca-HAP is a key step in the early formation of atherosclerotic plaques:\n1. Cardiac calcium computerized tomography detects calcium in early lesions of coronary atherosclerosis and this investigation has been recommended by the American Heart Association for high-risk patients. 28, 29 2. In pathologic specimens, Ca-HAP is incorporated with cholesterol and, to a lesser extent, with 7-ketocholesterol (7-keto) in atherosclerotic plaques. 30, 31 3. Ca-HAP is deposited diffusely in arterial vessels and in vessels of low shear strength in diabetics and in patients with stage 3 and 4 kidney disease. [32] [33] [34] [35] 4. Lanthanum, administered as LaCl 3, is an element with similar chemical properties as Ca +2 and suppresses atherosclerosis. 36 Lanthanum binds to cellular Ca +2 sites in a less reversible manner than Ca"}, {"section_title": "+2", "text": ". 36 Lanthanum carbonate has been shown to reduce progression of vascular calcification in a cohort of patients who require hemodialysis. 37 5. Homocysteinemia, a high-risk factor for atherosclerosis, produces early calcification of the arterial vessels. Although tempting to define this calcification as the reactive sulfhydral group in homocysteine binding to CA-HAP, the chemistry, particularly the large ionic radius of sulfur compared ] by chelation or decreasing a common ion through medications will be effective.\nIn nature, the ionic bond between Ca 2+ and OH \u2212 allows for various anionic substitutions including fluoride and carbonate. 41 Incorporation of F \u2212 into Ca-HAP has been postulated to occur by a number of mechanisms including substitution for the OH \u2212 group. 41 The ionic radius of an anion predicts whether it will fit into the crystal matrix of Ca-HAP. The chloride ion, present in plasma, has an atomic radius of 1.81 \u00c5 and will rarely form an ionic bond with Ca-HAP; however, O \u2212 and F \u2212 have comparable ionic radii (1.44 \u00c5 and 1.33 \u00c5) which favors the substitution. 42 The ionic radius of the OH \u2212 is reported as 152 \u00c5. 43 The OH \u2212 group (leaving as H 2 O) is located on the crystal surface, which could permit a cholesterol anion formed during ester hydrolysis to bind without steric problems (Fig. 7) . In this concept, cholesterol ester is hydrolyzed producing a reactive intermediate anion that can displace the OH \u2212 of Ca-HAP with H 2 O as the leaving group (Fig. 8) . Even without the aid of computerized molecular modeling it is apparent that the anion of cholesterol ester hydrolysis is much too large to fit into the crystal lattice structure of Ca-HAP in a manner similar to the ionic substitution found in F \u2212 , however the surface substitution of OH \u2212 for the anion of cholesterol ester hydrolysis is quite probably, can be modeled, and may have some similarities to the substitution of carbonate that is found in nature. Furthermore, Ca-HAP column chromatography has been used to separate anions of lipoproteins and proteins.

However, the \u2206S of the reaction at 310 K is most likely positive as a more disordered state is produced (solid to liquid). Therefore, the free energy (\u2206G) for formation of the calcium hydroxyapatite ion (Ca-AP + ) independent of temperature is probably negative, and the reaction is spontaneous.

Of note, in 1954 Rosenkrantz and Gut showed that the enol tautomer of 7-keto did not form in solvents, but they did not investigate the reaction in biological fluids."}, {"section_title": "50", "text": "Additional support for the mechanism of formation of the Ca-AP\u223ccholesterol complex discussed above:\n1.

Electron microscopy studies show Ca-HAP and non-esterified cholesterol associated in a crystal agglomerate. 5. The Ca-AP\u223ccholesterol complex is found in locations where lipoprotein carriers of cholesterol come in contact with Ca-HAP. These locations include arteries and the pineal gland where the capillary structure is fragile.

Preventing further deposition of Ca-HAP may be possible with:\n1. Exercise that increases bone density and shifts the concentration of Ca-HAP away from vascular deposition. 59 2. Decreasing arterial wall tension by controlling hypertension. 59 3. In diabetic patients, improved regulation of glucose may decrease oxidative stress within the arterial smooth muscle. 60 4. Discontinuation of vasoconstrictors such as cigarette smoke. 61 Acute therapies for patients suffering from various forms of ischemia from atherosclerosis, such as hemorrhagic, embolic, and low-flow events, may include denitrogenation as well as traditional oxygenation. This concept was first put forth by VanDeripe. 62, 63 As tissues become ischemic, the partial pressures of nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and nitric oxide increase as the oxygen tension falls. Denitrogenation and administration of high concentrations of oxygen preferably with an inert gas such as helium will displace nitrogen and increase the partial pressure of oxygen in ischemic tissues (Table 1) . With a simple apparatus and a high oxygen flow, a large percentage of the nitrogen stored in the body can be expelled within 1 hour. 64 If such a device is not available, a non-rebreathing face mask with one-way expiratory valves that is attached to high Lipid Insights 2011:4 oxygen flows should facilitate denitrogenation."}, {"section_title": "65,66", "text": "There is no single well defined threshold below which oxygen toxicity will not occur.

This treatment could be instituted by paramedics and other emergency personnel and may salvage tissue that was once considered non-viable, especially if the body has time to adapt to the acute ischemic event. If indicated, this relatively low-risk procedure may be coupled with higher-risk forms of thrombolytic therapy.\nTreatment of chronic accumulation of plaque has been outlined in numerous publications.

Reflecting on the proposed chemistry, the hydrolysis of an ester under basic conditions is known to produce an anion intermediate, but the clinical significance of the presumed short-lived intermediate of cholesterol hydrolysis could be overestimated. The \u2206G of the proposed reactions is negative, proceeding spontaneously, but the rates could be so slow that they are also not clinically significant.
