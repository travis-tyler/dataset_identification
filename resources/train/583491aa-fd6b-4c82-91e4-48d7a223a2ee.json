[{"section_title": "", "text": "NMME forecasts are generally skillful even at the longest leads (as measured by anomaly correlations in the hindcast period 1982-2010) in forecasting North Pacific SST anomalies, through there is some seasonal variability in skill scores. By early 2014, NMME forecasts at a three month lead indicated something of an evolution in the warm mid-Pacific, with anomalies re-centering to the east, as seen in Fig. 1. Since mid-2014, most ensemble systems have consistently forecast a continuation of warm anomalies along the west and northwest North American coasts, and to a lesser extent a pool of negative anomalies in the mid-Pacific. The April 1, 2015 initialized NMME forecast, representing the grid point average of near 100 ensemble members from seven different ensemble system for the early summer season (May through July) and autumn (September through November) 2015 are shown in Fig. 2. While the dynamic climate models have skill in forecasting SST anomalies in the North Pacific, forecasts by the CFS the PDO Index has not proved skillful. Figure 3 shows the CFS forecasts of PDO Index compared to the CPC derived observed PDO Index from mid-2013 through late 2014. Not only has the CFS mean failed to capture the strong positive projection of PDO Index, the CPC PDO Index has often been outside any of the constituent ensemble members.   A new satellite-derived low cloud retrieval product (Schwartz et al, 2015) allows for a broader spatial examination of the marine stratus frequency. This cloud detection algorithm discriminates low liquid water clouds from high ice clouds and clear sky, through the use of the visible, shortwave infrared and longwave infrared channels on the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES). The dataset has a spatial resolution of 4km, a temporal resolution of 30 minutes and currently extends from 1996-2014. Figure 1 shows the low cloudiness frequency anomaly (left panel) along the N.E. Pacific and U.S. West coast during MJJAS 2014 from this satellite derived product. The satellite data reveals a large area of negative anomalies over the Southern California coastal region extending south along much of Baja California. Along the central and northern California coast, slight positive anomalies are found trending toward negative values further offshore. Also displayed (middle panel) is how the 2014 low cloudiness anomaly ranked among the 19 years of the satellite dataset. Over much of the west coast and offshore regions, the 2014 low cloudiness frequency was ranked near the bottom of the 19 years. The amount of 2014 summer low clouds was the lowest over the 19 years over nearly the entire Southern California Bight region, Northern Baja California and portions of the Pacific Northwest (right panel). A recent study by Schwartz et al (2014) showed significant associations between largescale sea surface temperature (SST) patterns and coastal low cloudiness along the North 9 American west coast. The SST strongly impacts the temperature of the marine boundary layer and the base of the inversion, and is thus a key component regulating the strength of the inversion. A higher SST leads to a weaker temperature inversion and thus an environment less conducive to both the formation and persistence of marine stratus clouds. Strong positive SST anomalies, reaching at periods up to 2-3\u00b0C, existed along much of the California and Baja coastal waters during MJJAS 2014. Mean inversion strength during this period, as measured from 00Z radiosonde measurements at Miramar (San Diego) were on average about 1.2\u00b0C (22%) weaker than normal. It is reasonable to assume that the weakened inversion strength due to high SST values led, at least in part, to the reduction in marine stratus clouds over Southern California. It is important to note that reduced cloudiness would have a positive feedback on the SST, but due to the large spatial size of the SST feature, it is likely that in this case the SST led the clouds, at least at the onset. It is also possible that atmospheric circulation features associated with the large-scale SST anomaly patterns may have contributed to the reduced marine stratus. Figure 1. Satellite-derived coastal low cloudiness frequency anomaly during May-Sept 2014 is shown in the left panel, gray contour denotes zero. The ranking of the 2014 anomaly within the 19 years of data is displayed in the middle panel while those pixels for which the 2014 year had the lowest anomaly are denoted in the right panel.   The general trend in sea surface temperature (SST) over the first decade of the 21 st Century had been towards more La Nina-like and negative Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) conditions (Hilburn and Wentz, 2014). This pattern is characterized by strong trade winds in the central Equatorial Pacific that produced a cold anomaly on the Equator. That cold anomaly extended up into the middle latitudes and along the west coast of North America. The strong trade winds produced moisture convergence in the west Pacific where heavy precipitation occurred. This left negative precipitation anomalies in the central Pacific, and the anomalous latent heating was mainly responsible for quasi-stationary wave patterns in the mid-latitude atmosphere associated with cold winters over Europe and Asia (Trenberth et al., 2014). In 2014, we began to see the tropics shifting into a more El Nino-like pattern with a weakening of the trade winds in the central Pacific. SSTs have been warming in the central Equatorial Pacific, and with it, the precipitation anomalies in the central Pacific are positive. When latent heating from precipitation is located in the central Pacific, it is more likely to force a quasi-stationary pattern with a ridge over the Gulf of Alaska and western U.S. with a trough over the Midwest and East Coast of the United States. This has been responsible for the most recent cold winter on the East Coast. The California drought began in 2012 when the RRR began preventing winter storms from reaching our coasts (Swain et al., 2014). During spring and summer 2013, the area of California covered by severe drought increased from 20% to 80%. Meager wintertime precipitation in 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 has not been enough to counteract the drought. Thus, the current drought actually began before the current El Nino-like and positive PDO conditions; however since establishment of the conditions, the drought has dramatically worsened. Bond et al. (2015) find that the anomalously high SSTs in the Gulf of Alaska resulted from lower than normal rates of heat loss from the upper ocean and relatively weak cold advection. Both of these processes are controlled by the quasi-stationary weather pattern forced by El Nino in the tropics. Fig. 1 shows the close correspondence between the location of the blob and the location of the blocking ridge in the atmosphere, and examination of other months in 2014 confirm that they move together. Monitoring of the blob and any predictions about the future of the blob depend on the processes controlling PDO (Newman et al., 2015). This requires monitoring the state of El Nino, the intense winds of the Aleutian low, and processes controlling the Aleutian low, which include tropical cyclone recurvature and the location and stability of the Kuroshio-Oyashio Extension. Monitoring of PDO, hence the blob, requires knowledge of SST, surface wind, and rain rate. Microwave satellite data provide accurate information about these parameters. The scientific work needed is to determine the proper spatial domains and seasonality considerations in interpreting the satellite data to provide a comprehensive picture of the processes relevant to controlling the intensity and location of the blob.

"}, {"section_title": "ABSTRACT", "text": "In spring 2014 a strong downwelling Kelvin wave crossed the equatorial Pacific, prompting predictions of a large El Ni\u00f1o and a great deal of press coverage. It had been 18 years since the last large El Ni\u00f1o and as a result of the cool eastern Pacific that had been prominent since, California had been mired in one of the most significant droughts on record. It is rather paradoxical that a cool and productive ocean results in stress on land. The news of a large El Ni\u00f1o, normally thought of as a catastrophic event, brought cheers to most Californians. It also brought thoughts of a change in regime; was this the end of almost 20 years of cooler than average eastern Pacific sea surface temperatures (SST), and were we looking at 20 or more years of warmer SSTs? The large El Ni\u00f1o however, never materialized. What did materialize was an unusually warm North Pacific during the second half of 2014. The patterns observed were extremely similar to those during an El Ni\u00f1o but they happened without one. These unusual North Pacific conditions helped make 2014 the warmest year ever observed during the 120 year instrumental record in California and globally. Numerous temperature records were broken in western North America, from Alaska to Arizona. The long-term trend in ocean warming is about 0.1\u00b0C/decade, and therefore cannot by itself explain the anomalous warmth that exceeded several degrees in many places. The exceptionally warm waters in the eastern North Pacific may then be related to a natural shift in climate. The Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) index varies between mostly positive (warm) and mostly negative (cool) on periods between 40 and 70 years and became sharply positive in 2014. The North Pacific anomalies were captured beautifully by the sensors on the M1 mooring in Monterey Bay. An SST of 18\u00b0C was observed in late August 2014, the warmest ever measured during the 25-year record at M1, warmer than the 1997-98 El Ni\u00f1o of the century. The warmer than average North Pacific SSTs were enhanced in Monterey Bay and the California Current during summer, as the cold ocean-hot land gradient was lessened, weakening upwelling-favorable winds. Less wind resulted in calm conditions after July, with little upwelling and a warm, clear and relatively unproductive coastal upwelling system. Warm water at the surface indicates lower nutrient availability for the most important primary producers in the ocean, phytoplankton. Nitrate is a key nutrient that enables the production of high phytoplankton biomass in upwelling systems. MBARI scientists have developed novel sensors for nitrate, allowing it to be measured hourly at 1 m depth at the M1 mooring since 2002. The mean monthly values measured during the second half of 2014 are the lowest of any year in the record. During normal years nitrate concentrations at the mooring are characterized by frequent upwelling events that increase concentrations to values from 5 to 30 \u00b5M. For the four months from August through November, the daily average nitrate did not exceed 1 \u00b5M. This was an unprecedented string of low nitrate concentrations. Such low nitrate concentrations must have significant impact on the marine ecosystem by limiting primary production. The lower than average chlorophyll fluorescence values observed at M1 during 2014 support this decrease in primary production. The decreases in fluorescence were significant but not as large as what one would surmise from SST and nitrate. Another indication of the unusually warm 2014 was the increase in warmer water southern species in Monterey Bay. John Pearse and colleagues documented a dramatic increase in the colorful rose nudribranch (Hopkinsia rosacaea) in the rocky intertidal of Hopkins Marine Station in Pacific Grove. And MBARI staff reported the recruitment of the medialuna or half-moon (Medialuna californiensis) beneath the M1 mooring during servicing visits. The medialuna has a symbiotic relationship with Mola mola, feeding on its parasites. In sharp contrast to the decreased productivity, for the second summer and fall in a row inshore Monterey Bay attracted enormous schools of feed fish and their predators ---birds, sea lions, dolphins and whales. What can explain these paradoxical observations? The observations of an ecosystem that has been deprived of its fuel, nitrate and other nutrients normally provided by upwelling, and the observations of significant numbers of marine wildlife. We offer two hypotheses, neither exclusive from the other. One significant difference between the warm 2014 conditions in Monterey Bay and El Ni\u00f1o was the lack of a strong anomaly at depth. During El Ni\u00f1o, remotely forced waves deepen the thermocline, nutricline and mixed layer. During 2014 the lens of warm water overlay a shallow and strong thermocline. It is likely that some nitrate was supplied to the surface waters but consumed immediately. Lower than atmospheric concentrations of sea surface carbon dioxide provide support to some nitrate supply. However, even though there was some fuel provided in 2014, it was clearly much less than during other years, so other processes must also have contributed to the bonanza in marine wildlife, whales in particular. One such process is the collapse of an ecosystem that normally occupies an area of about a hundred kilometers next to the coast to one of a only a few 10s of kilometers along the coast and in Monterey Bay. Bays in particular act as refugia for wildlife during difficult times. The large numbers of wildlife are then a consequence of an increase in concentration over a small area rather than an actual increase in numbers. We have no information about the nutritional state of the wildlife but one has to think that body fat or other indicators of condition would show the effects of the decreases in primary production. enables subsetting, extraction, and visualization of swath satellite data. 3.

Data from these sites are used to determine if oceanographic changes in Gulf of Alaska shelf waters are synchronous with near-shore conditions measured in Cook Inlet and Prince William Sound. Coastal waters of the Gulf of Alaska are connected by the wind and freshwater-driven Alaska Coastal Current. Cook Inlet and Prince William Sound are large estuaries in the northern Gulf that experience upwelling of shelf waters and are locally influenced by freshwater input (precipitation and snowpack and glacier melt), large tides, and topographically steered winds. Ocean conditions drive the timing and magnitude of primary production through changes in light, temperature, nutrients, and stratification, which are influenced by local (e.g. upwelling, topographic wind forcing) and basin-scale (e.g. variability in Aleutian Low wind patterns) processes in the Gulf of Alaska (Mundy 2005). Comparisons of temperature time series between Cook Inlet, Prince William Sound and the GAK1 mooring on the shelf near the mouth of Resurrection Bay show consistent warm anomalies in coastal areas during 2014, with a magnitude similar to those observed in 2005.\nA new Climatology app by NANOOS shows the SST at several NDBC buoys is well above 2 standard deviations outside the 39 year mean (Fig. 1). A data-rich set of observations on the NW Washington Coast from the UW-NANOOS Cha'ba and NEMO-subsurface moorings positioned mid-shelf recorded over the full water column the movement of the unprecedentedly-warm water of the North Pacific \"blob\" onto the shelf following the fall transition to downwelling-favorable winds, resulting in temperature anomalies greater than 6\u00b0C above past records, and reveal information on the link between variations of shelf dissolved oxygen and local wind forcing. Observations spanning late June through late October 2014 from two NANOOS/UW moorings mid-shelf on the NW Washington Coast indicate that upper ocean conditions (T, S, DO, chlorophyll) in this region were similar to previous observations (2011 -2013) for most of this period with a two notable exceptions: summertime deep oxygen and early fall temperature (Fig. 2a, c). Deep DO was on average about 1 mg l -1 lower than previous (albeit limited) observations, starting at roughly 3 mg l -1 and dropping to 1 mg l -1 before rising again in mid-September ( Fig. 2a). Unlike 2013, however, the 2014 record does not show any rapid and short-lived (<week) extreme drops in DO. There was typically a robust correlation between shelf wind direction, the resultant currents, and changes in deep DO. Somewhat counter-intuitively, upwelling favorable winds (from NW), resulted in local increases in deep DO, and downwelling-favorable winds (from SE) resulted in local decreases (Fig. 3a, b, d). This appears to be a consequence of the advection of a north-south DO gradient with lower DO to the south that moves northward to the mooring site, consistent with past observations (Connolly et al., 2010). The relationship between winds/currents and DO reversed to the expected pattern after extended downwelling and a pulse (> week) of very strong, nearly fulldepth northward currents (>0.3 m s-1) in late September (Fig. 3b, d). A potential explanation is that the extended, strong northward flow may have flushed the low -DO water past the mooring site. Thus, during this strong downwelling event, DO levels at the mooring site first dropped, then increased again, presumably as the low DO patch advected past. The measured current speed and duration relative to the expected low-DO patch size support this mechanism. For much of the summer, temperatures were not particularly anomalous, despite the much warmer water offshore apparent from satellite images, highlighting the complex interplay between ocean basin-scale anomalies (the \"blob\") and local oceanographic processes (upwelling). Near-surface (3 m) temperatures remained near the average of past mooring records, staying below 1\u00b0C for much of the summer (Fig. 2c). However, following a strong, extended downwelling-favorable wind event driving northward currents in late September (Fig. 3a, b), upper ocean temperatures rapidly increased from ~9\u00b0C to more than 14\u00b0C (Fig. 3c). Then following a 2-week period of weak and variable winds, another return to strong downwelling-favorable winds brought the \"blob\" further ashore, thickening this layer to >50 m and elevating temperatures above 15\u00b0C, more than 6\u00b0C above 2013 observations from this period at mid-depths (20-60 m) (Fig. 3a, c).    The extent and impact of this anomalous ocean condition on nearshore environments of the West Coast is of ecological concern, since previous warm SST anomalies in 1997 and 2005 led to decreased primary productivity and impaired or unusual habitat conditions for aquatic animals throughout the California Current Ecosystem (Chavez et al. 2002, Kudela et al. 2006). Here we report evidence of the 2014 anomaly moving onshore and entering the Columbia River mouth, as measured by in situ instruments deployed in the salt-wedge region of the estuary. Time series measurements of temperature from 1997-2015 provide evidence that the anomaly reached the estuary in Fall 2014, following the end of the upwelling season (Fig. 1). Temperatures remained high from October 2014 through April 2015. Table 1 summarizes 2014-2015 temperatures compared to previous years for the six-month period between October and April (185 days). Relative to the average of all years, 2014 May 1, 2015 31 was warmer on 184 out of the 185 days, with an average difference of +2.1\u00b0C. Relative to the El Ni\u00f1o conditions of 1997-1998, 2014 was warmer on 135 out of the 185 days, with an average difference of +0.6\u00b0C. The summers associated with the El Ni\u00f1o and 2005 warm anomalies had periods of poor primary productivity on the continental shelf as a result of reduced upwelling conditions and high temperatures. However for the period shown in Table 1, neither of those years reached comparable temperatures to 2014-2015. If conditions persist into spring and summer 2015, the anomaly may lead to conditions similar to 2005 yet unprecedented in the temporal persistence at the nearshore environment. The temperature data shown in Fig. 1 is complemented by a variety of biogeochemical sensors that were deployed beginning in 2008 as a part of the NSF Science and Technology Center for Coastal Margin Observation & Prediction. Phytoplankton blooms from the coastal ocean can be easily detected in the saline waters of the estuary (Roegner et al. 2011). To date, there is evidence that phytoplankton blooms in the near shore region were reduced in Fall 2014, but no other obvious trends in biogeochemical parameters have been noted. Planned continued monitoring of biogeochemical parameters throughout the upwelling period of 2015 will help determine the extent of changes in ocean conditions at the nearshore coastal margin that result from the continued presence of this large scale temperature anomaly. \nA mid-shelf mooring has been maintained 10 nm off Newport, Oregon, for more than 15 years. The seasonal variation is very strong, but the length of the record allows extraction of non-seasonal anomalies. The longest records are for the vertical distribution of currents from an ADCP, but substantial records exist also for temperature and salinity at multiple depths. We will examine these records for anomalous behavior coincident with the Warm Blob. Changes to the hydrography and zooplankton in the northern California Current in response to 'the blob' William T. Peterson* 1 , Jennifer L. Fisher 2 and Jay O.  1997-98, 2002-03, 2004-05, 2006-07 and 2009-10) have been sampled since 1996 where warm water and anomalously high biomass of subtropical copepods were observed at 44.6\u00b0N, regardless of the magnitude of the event at the equator or the sign of the PDO. We compare the local hydrography and species composition across 20 years of positive PDO and five El Ni\u00f1o events in comparison to the anomalously warm event of 2014-15. During this past warm event, the waters off Newport were seasonally warm (+2\u00b0C anomaly) and fresh (by 0.2 salinity units) and the biomass anomalies of warm (cold) water copepods increased (decreased) dramatically as was observed during other positive PDO and ENSO years. However, the copepod species richness on the shelf has been the highest in the past 20 years, indicating source waters from offshore. In fact, seventeen copepod species, many of which have tropical affinities, have been recorded on the Oregon shelf that have not been observed at any time over at least the past 50 years, making this extreme event unlike any other. For each of the three lines, a comprehensive climatology has been constructed from the multiyear timeseries. The climatology is comprised of objectively mapped fields, uniformly spaced in depth, time and offshore distance. It facilitates the analysis of mean structures, annual cycles and interannual anomalies. Periodically updated, the climatology includes recent observations and allows for sustained monitoring of mesoscale and largescale features in the CCS. The largest interannual signal in the glider climatology is the ongoing surface-intensified warming anomaly, which began in early 2014 and persists through present (Fig. 1a). Positive temperature anomalies are strongest in the upper 50 meters of the water column ( Fig. 1b) and reached up to 5\u00b0C during the last 16 months. Previous interannual temperature anomalies in the dataset were linked to ENSO events (Todd et al., 2011), however, those anomalies had weaker magnitudes and subsurface maxima (Fig. 1b). The timing and strength of the recent warming is consistent along each glider line (Fig. 2) and concurrent with weakening northerly winds and a deepening of isopycnals. Our ongoing analysis of the glider climatology and atmospheric data aims to understand the cause, and ultimately the fate, of the warm surface waters in the southern CCS.  The first signs of anomalous warming of bottom waters within kelp forests of the Santa Barbara Channel may have appeared in early 2013 when anomalies turned mainly positive. Apart from spring upwelling in 2013 when temperature anomalies were neutral, positive anomalies have been recorded every month since early 2013 with deviations ranging as high as 3.8 o C above the 14-year monthly mean. This is unprecedented in the time series (Figure 1a). Positive anomalies in salinity (\uf044S) were also observed every month since late 2012 and \uf044S exceeded 0.3 for several months in 2013 and 2014. Positive \uf044S values occurred in previous years, but were weaker and shorter in duration. Apart from 1-2 months, anomalies in nitrate, phosphate, and silicate turned consistently negative in late 2012. However, comparable anomalies in these nutrients occurred earlier in the record, especially before 2008 for nitrate and phosphate (Figure 1a). We are currently investigating the source waters of the positive \uf044S and the causes of decreased nutrients. Large anomalies in key ecological characteristics of giant kelp forests associated with the large positive temperature anomalies have not been observed. Water column chlorophyll a, the standing biomass of giant kelp and reef fish, and the nitrogen content of giant kelp were lower, and densities of recently settled sea urchins were higher than normal, but not markedly so compared to prior years (Figure 1b). Shorter time series data on pigment concentrations in kelp revealed a declining trend in recent years consistent with the belownormal levels observed in kelp tissue nitrogen. The most dramatic change in kelp forests that coincided with the onset of the \"blob\" was observed in sea star species, which first showed signs of a wasting disease in fall of 2013. The disease spread rapidly from north to south and by spring 2014 infections were prevalent throughout southern California. Bottom temperature (8-10 m depth)   100 m. Isopycnals in the thermocline were displaced downward during both, the 1998 El Nino and the 2014/5 Warm Event. Anomalies of salinity in the mixed layer and spiciness on isopycnals at depth did not respond to the Warm Anomaly. In contrast, nitracline depths (the depth where concentrations of nitrate reach values of 1 uM) were unusually high and concentrations of nitrate, and other macronutrients were unusually low in the mixed layer, similar to observations during the 1998 El Nino. Phytoplankton biomass, which is likely limited by the availability of inorganic nitrogen over large areas of the domain, was unusually low during the last 9 months. Low concentrations of nitrate and phytoplankton biomass are usually due to weak upwellingfavorable winds in the region. This was not the case for most of 2014/15 when upwelling favorable winds were normal, with the exception of July and August of 2014. To conclude, the limited perspective provided by the CalCOFI data and time series suggests that the 2014/15 warm anomaly was due to a change in the water masses advected into the region. The anomalously warm surface layer that has been present since the middle of 2014, serves as a cap on the system, inhibiting the transport of nutrients from depth into the euph otic zone. This lack of nutrients reduces the productivity of the system with likely significant effects on the rest of the ecosystem.  1984 1988 1992 1996 2000 2004 2008 2012 2016 Chl a Anomaly (ug L-1) . \nThe idea of anomalous events elicits the question: \"change as compared to what?\" That is, some background or baseline information is required to define the meaning of the word change. Using long-term data sets of temperature, salinity and chlorophyll as baseline observations, we can determine the sign, magnitude and frequency of change. Beginning in 1916 at Scripps Institution of Oceanography Pier (La Jolla, CA), daily measurements of sea surface temperature and salinity provide a context to evaluate the recent and most rapid temperature increase event since the generalized warming of the late 70's. Chlorophyll concentration at this location has declined strongly since November 2012. Warm temperatures and low chlorophyll have also been observed at other Southern California Bight stations.

Bjorkstedt* 1,2 , Roxanne R. Robertson 2 and William T. \nSince early 2008, we have sampled zooplankton and their environment along the Trinidad Head Line (THL; 41\u00b0 3.5' N) at approximately monthly intervals throughout the year, with the goal of characterizing ecosystem state at the base of the food chain. Here, we present evidence that the coastal zooplankton community present off northern California was strongly influenced by the arrival of unusually warm water in 2014. We analyze copepod community structure at a mid-shelf station (TH02; 75m depth) based on samples taken with a vertical tow from 100 m (or within a few meters of the sea floor) of a 0.5 m diameter ring net fitted with 202 \u03bcm mesh and a TSK flowmeter. We also characterize the euphausiid community based on analysis of zooplankton sampled with oblique tows (max. depth of 100 m) of a standard CalCOFI bongo net fitted with 505 \u03bcm mesh on one side and 335 \u03bcm mesh on the other. CTD casts measuring temperature, salinity, fluorescence, transmissivity, PAR, and dissolved oxygen are conducted at each station. We applied non-metric multi-dimensional scaling (NMDS) to discern structure within the copepod assemblage observed at the mid-shelf station (TH02,41\u00b0 3.5' N,124\u00b0 16' W,75m depth). The first axis of this ordination (NMDS1) distinguishes assemblages with abundant cold-water, neritic species from those dominated by species with warm-water or oceanic affinities ( Figure  1). Seasonal transitions between cold-water and warm-water assemblages occur each year, with variability in assemblage structure corresponding to water mass characteristics and reflecting unusual transport patterns or the influence of climate events (e.g., the 2009-10 El Ni\u00f1o) ( Figures 2 and 3, Bjorkstedt et al. in prep). In the 47 second half of 2014, reduced upwelling and the subsequent arrival of unusually warm waters associated with \"The Blob\" caused an earlier than usual decline in the prevalence of cold-water copepods-which began in Julyand observation of an assemblage dominated by warm-water, oceanic copepods to an extent not previously observed (Figures 1-3). Moreover, we observed several species of copepod not previously reported in the THL time series. Changes were also observed in the euphausiid assemblage, with the appearance of a warm-water species (e.g., Euphausia recurva) not previously observed in our record.  1 MBC Applied Environmental Sciences, Costa Mesa, CA, USA (E-mail: emiller@mbcnet.net)\nUsing three unique long-term time series of nearshore fish abundance and biomass, the response of southern California coastal fishes to the anomalous conditions o f 2014 was investigated. Since at least 1980, demersal fish and invertebrate surveys have been conducted with otter trawls during summer offshore of Sam Clemente (6, 12, and 18 m isobaths) and offshore of Huntington Beach (6 m). In addition, fish impingement has been monitored at the Huntington Beach Generating Station (multiple times per year). These data provide robust resolution on species-specific abundance, biomass, diversity, and size of the fish communities at these locations. Prior studies affirmed the fish impingement at Huntington Beach Generating Station represents patterns in coastal midwater fishes throughout the Southern California Bight (Miller and McGowan 2013). Utilizing these data, this investigation examined what, if any, changes in the ju venile and adult fish communities occurred. Furthermore, using the impingement monitoring data, an assessment of recruitment was made to determine how the 2014 year class (for select species) compares with the prior 40 years. Since 1975, The Marine Mammal Center (TMMC) has been authorized by the National Marine Fisheries Service to respond to and collect data from marine mammals that strand along the California coast from San Luis Obispo (SLO) to Mendocino (MEN) County. TMMC's range expanded to include Santa Barbara (SB) County in 2014. For this study, pinniped stranding data was compiled for 2014 and 2015, and these data were compared to previous stranding trends. Total stranding numbers for 2014-2015 were calculated for MEN-SB and MEN-SLO Counties, with California sea lions (CSL; Zalophus californianus) representing 93% of the stranded pinnipeds admitted to TMMC from SB County. Statistical comparisons excluded data collected before 1997, the year when consistent recovery efforts began (Melin et al. 2010). Overall, a greater number of pinnipeds stranded in 2014 (nMEN-SB = 985, nMEN-SLO = 803) to date in 2015 (nMEN-SB = 1061, nMEN-SLO = 736) compared with mean annual strandings from 1997-2013 (685 \u00b1 78). Specifically in 2014, a greater number of CSL, most of which were adult females, stranded with signs of acute domoic acid toxicosis (n = 163) compared with previous years (41 \u00b1 8), and there were increased northern elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris; n2014 = 154, \u0305 1997-2013 = 126 \u00b1 9) and northern fur seal (Callorhinus ursinus; n2014 = 28, \u0305 1997-2013 = 12 \u00b1 3) strandings. In the spring of 2015, a majority of the stranded pinnipeds were CSL that are less than two years old (n = 664). In addition, although Guadalupe fur seals (GFS; Actocephalus townsendi) infrequently strand in California, with zero to five stranding annually from 1977-2014, 12 GFS stranded and were admitted to TMMC in the first four months of 2015. The timing of pinniped strandings, and specifically of CSL less than two years old, also has been anomalous in recent years. Whereas a majority of young CSL typically strand in the summer (May-July, 53 \u00b1 3%), the peak in strandings for CSL age 0-2 years shifted to the spring (March-May) in 2013 and 2014 and even earlier in 2015 ( Figure 1). The increased number of pinnipeds that stranded on California beaches in and the spring of 2015 was similar to previous years in which anomalous oceanographic conditions were observed in the California Current System (CCS). Greater numbers of pinniped strandings have occurred in the summer following strong El Ni\u00f1o events (1992 and 1998) and when strong negative upwelling persisted in the summer (2009). The summer is when CSL pups are weaned at approximately one year of age, which likely makes them particularly vulnerable to these environmental perturbations. Furthermore, CSL are the most abundant year-round marine mammal residents in the CCS. In recent years, the shifted peak in strandings of young CSL to the spring months indicates lactating females are unable to adequately provision their pups, rather than pups failing to thrive after weaning. Because adult female sea lions are experienced foragers, failure by mothers to find enough food to nurse their pups may indicate greater depletion of or changes to fish stocks than previous years with persistent, large-scale oceanographic anomalies in the CCS. The increase in females with domoic acid toxicosis in 2014 also may reflect a further contribution to lactational failure in affected animals. Thus, marine mammal stranding data adds another layer to improve the overall understanding of the CCS and ecosystem health. Despite marine mammals being an integral component of marine ecosystems and sentinel species that generate considerable public interest, marine mammal health and stranding data currently are not readily accessible or integrated with biogeochemical and physical oceanographic parameters. Therefore, efforts are underway to collate existing marine mammal data into a database (the \"Marine Mammal Health Monitoring and Analysis Platform\", or MMHMAP) compatible for integration with environmental datasets and accessible by the public within the Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS), which will facilitate research collaborations, science-based management, and public awareness. off Cabo Corrientes. In upper-ocean chlorophyll concentrations progressively diminish from January to March. This is the opposite tendency to that observed in 2013 when March was the more productive in terms of chlorophyll. In the anomaly maps the southern Gulf and its entrance are shown to be chlorophyll-deficient from January 2014 onwards. In March the region shows no sign of recovery. Even considering the activation of the upwelling zone off Cabo Corrientes, the region as a whole remains low in chlorophyll content. 1 Institute of Marine Science, School of Fisheries and Ocean Science, University of Alaska Fairbanks, Fairbanks, AK, USA (E-mail: sldanielson@alaksa.edu, tjweingartner@alaska.edu, rrhopcroft@alaska.edu)\nHydrographic data collected on the northern Gulf of Alaska shelf reveal multi-decadal trends and seasonal to multi-annual fluctuations around these trends (Royer et al., 2005;Janout et al, 2010). Water column stratification is increasing over time, the springtime onset of stratification may be starting earlier, and temperatures are increasing. All of these changes may precipitate adjustments within the biological components of the ecosystem but actual consequences are still as yet unknown. At station GAK1 on the inner shelf, long-period trends (Figure 1) include warming (~ 0.2 \u00b0C decade -1 ) and freshening (0.15 decade -1 ) at the surface, while subsurface waters exhibit increases in both temperature (0.15 \u00b0C decade -1 ) and salinity (0.025 decade -1 ) over waters 100-200 m below the surface. Relationships are found with the PDO (3 month lead, r 2 = 0.38 for temperature and r 2 = 0.15 for surface salinity) and SOI (8-9 month lead, r 2 = 0.20 for temperature and r 2 = 0.20 for salinity). Temperature and salinity variations are nonuniform across the shelf and with depth ( Figure 2). Changes in density (and stratification) are moderated by compensating changes in the temperature and salinity at times but at other times the two parameters work to increase or decrease density together. For example, from 2013 to 2014 the density in the upper 300 m of the water column declined, with temperatures increasing by 2-4 \u00b0C near the surface and by up to 0.5\u00b0 at 200-300 m depth. Over the same time May 1, 2015 60 period, salinities tended to decrease at slope and mid-shelf stations, with the largest decrease (> 1) observed at 100m depth at stations beyond the shelf break. Inner shelf station stations salinities decreased from 2013 to 2014 below 100 m depth.  1 Coastal Data Information Program, Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA (Email: lelilly@ucsd.edu, darren@cdip.ucsd.edu, jothomas@ucsd.edu)\nSummer 2014 produced anomalously warm ocean temperatures offshore California, raising questions from both researchers and the general public about how these temperatures compare to previous years, and whether this was an isolated event or part of a larger cycle. Multi-year time-series of sea surface temperature (SST) along the U.S. West Coast were examined using data from Coastal Data Information Program (CDIP) nearshore buoys, plotted as climatological comparisons (Fig. 1), monthly-averaged boxplots (Fig. 3) and singleday cross-year comparisons (not shown). All stations examined had at least 8 years of data, with some records starting in the early 1990s. Climatological comparisons reveal that SSTs for Summer 2014-Winter 2015 are the highest temperatures recorded at each station (Fig. 1,  Fig. 3 Monitoring long-term SST variations provides valuable information about physical oceanographic parameters, which can influence the biology and climate of the region, and  larger-scale processes. Accurate observation and analysis of temperature trends can help inform recreational ocean users and the general public about present ocean conditions and related physical and biological changes (e.g. unusual species sightings, fishing stock status, coastal ocean health, atmospheric changes)."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Three decades of remotely sensed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) displays an overall increase of Arctic tundra vegetation greenness ( Fig. 1) but with considerable spatial variability of the trends. NDVI represents vegetation productivity as measured by above-ground biomass and has a universal relationship with biomass throughout the pan-Arctic tundra. Pan-Arctic tundra vegetation greening is responding to increases in available summer warmth ( Fig. 1) that are, in large-part, driven by summer sea-ice retreat along Arctic coasts (Bhatt et al. 2010). Since 80% of Arctic tundra is within 100-km of the coast, its variability is closely linked to that of the Arctic Ocean (Bhatt et al. 2013).

The annual historical temperatures for all of Alaska's 13 climate divisions (based on meteorological station data) display broadly similar variability between a 5-yr running average of the PDO and annual temperatures over the last 90+ years ( Figure 1; Bieniek et al. 2014). A long-term trend to warmer temperatures has also occurred with this low-frequency May 1, 2015 22 variability superimposed upon it in Alaska.

Breakup has been shown to occur earlier when temperatures are warmer in spring (Bieniek et al 2011). A mechanism that relates early breakup with positive ENSOlike SST anomalies in the Pacific and Gulf of Alaska storm tracks is demonstrated ( Figure 2) based on a statistical analysis of reanalysis, meteorological and hydrological station data. Identifying and investigating similar mechanisms is greatly needed in Alaska to better understand the drivers of month, seasonal and annual climate variability and trends. Such mechanisms will help to identify the potential of future climate change in the many regions of Alaska that are especially vulnerable to change. This will further help stakeholders to better plan and prepare adaptations if projected changes in future climate are better understood. Figure 2.

Average monthly water temperatures were above normal for all months in 2014 and warmer than any time since 2005, averaging a high of 12 o C in July in each year. Coherence calculated between temperatures at Seldovia and the GAK1 mooring (Fig. 3) show that the time series are coherent for periods greater than 3 months and independent at shorter time scales. Prince William Sound had similar warm temperature anomalies (Fig. 4) in 2014 and 2005. Near-surface water temperature time series constructed from NOAA National Water Level Observation Network tide gauge station data (not shown) also show consistently warm temperature anomalies for 2014 across the entire Gulf of Alaska coast.   The time series data (from the lighthouses and weather buoys) show that the date when there is a change from negative to positive temperature anomalies, and again when the 2014 and 2015 observations values exceed the historical maximum daily temperature, varies by location. Observations from the Strait of Georgia show a delayed influence of the warm Pacific Ocean water. The transition from cooler to warmer than normal SST conditions along Line P is seen to vary with distance. Warming of the offshore section is evident in August 2013 while a band of cooler surface water along the coast is present until the February 2015 survey. The oxygen profiles show a similar surface layer of negative oxygen concentration, as well as deeper vertical excursions of water with a negative oxygen anomaly. Density profiles show that starting in 2013 the Line P transect was characterized by a well-defined surface layer with waters of lower than normal density that penetrates to a depth of about 100 m. The strength of this stratification, and the mechanisms that control it, will likely determine the duration of the warm pool of water in the North Pacific . 1 Applied Physics Laboratory, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA (Email: janewton@uw.edu; jmickett@apl.washington.edu) 2 DOGAMI, Newport, OR, USA (Email: Jonathan.Allan@dogami.state.or.us)"}, {"section_title": "Data Source", "text": "Coastal Data Information Program (CDIP) buoys measure nearshore wave parameters and SST.
