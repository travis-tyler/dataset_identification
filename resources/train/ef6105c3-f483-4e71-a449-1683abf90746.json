Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia accounting for approximately 30 million cases worldwide [1, 2] . The incidence and prevalence of AD is age dependent, doubling every 5 years after age 65 [3] . As the proportion of population over 60 years of age continues to rise, the number of individuals developing AD will also increase, presenting a major health issue worldwide. Pathologically, AD is defined by extensive neuronal loss and accumulation of extracellular amyloid plaques formed by aggregation of \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) peptides and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyper-phosphorylated tau proteins [4] .\nAD has a strong genetic component. It has been generally recognized that there are two major categories of AD, familial early-onset AD (EOAD) and sporadic late-onset AD (LOAD). EOAD represents less than 1 % of all AD cases and they are characterized by early-onset, often before age 60, and Mendelian inheritance occurring mostly in an autosomal dominant manner. Linkage analysis of EOAD families in the 80's and early 90's led to the discoveries of fully penetrant disease causing mutations in APP encoding \u03b2-amyloid precursor protein, PSEN1 and PSEN2 encoding components of the \u03b3-secretase complex, presenilin 1 and presenilin 2 respectively [5] . In amyloidogenic pathway, APP, a transmembrane protein is first cleaved by a \u03b2-secretase, encoded by BACE1 and subsequently by the \u03b3-secretase complex to form A\u03b2 peptides [6, 7] . Identification of disease causing mutations in APP, PSEN1, PSEN2 underscores the pathogenic role of the amyloidogenic pathway in AD development [8, 9] .\nLinkage studies, genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and recent whole exome sequencing (WES) have identified dozens of risk genes in LOAD [4, 5, 10] . These risk genes have created a broader picture of pathways involved in AD pathogenesis. Several pathways have been highlighted by these genes, including cholesterol metabolism (APOE, CLU, ABCA7), immune response (CR1, CD33, MS4A, TREM2) and endocytosis (BIN1, PICALM, CD2AP, EPHA1, SORL1) [4] . Among AD risk genes and variants, APOE is the strongest risk factor. APOE has three isoforms determined by cysteineto-arginine substitutions at amino acid position 112 and 158, corresponding to two SNPs (rs429358 and rs7412 respectively) [11, 12] . The three isoforms are referred as APOE2 (cys112, cys158), APOE3 (cys112, arg158) and APOE4 (arg158, arg158) with the corresponding alleles designated \u03b52, \u03b53, and \u03b54 respectively [13] . APOE \u03b53 is the most common isoform with 60-70 % [14] allele frequency. APOE \u03b54 allele is associated with increased AD risk in both familial EOAD and sporadic LOAD, with 2-5 fold increased risk for heterozygous carriers and 12-15 fold increased risk for homozygous carriers in Caucasian populations [5, 15] . These risks have been estimated for as a 5.7 fold increase in homozygous and no increased risk in heterozygotes in the African American population [16] . In Hispanics, this risk is estimated to be 2.2 fold in homozygotes with no increased risk in heterozygotes [16] . However, there is a greater prevalence of Alzheimer's and other dementias in African-Americans and Hispanics, suggesting other environmental or genetic factors are at play [17] .\nElucidating the functional effects of naturally occurring genetic variants is one of the major challenges in genetic studies of human diseases [18] . With most of the genetic studies focused on variants associated with increased AD risks, there are a limited number of reports discussing variants that render protective effects against AD. The most notable example is the APP A673T mutation protecting against AD as well as cognitive decline in the elderly without AD due to 40 % reduction in the formation of A\u03b2 peptides [19] . Missense variants in several other genes associated with lowered risk of AD or neuronal atrophy, including TREML2 [20] , HMGCR [21] , and REST [22] , have recently been described. In this study, we applied a novel approach to discover AD protective variants by identifying genetic modifiers for AD risk in APOE high-risk \u03b54 allele carriers. Genotyping data of approximately one million markers plus 37 million imputed SNPs in Mount Sinai Biobank [23] were analyzed and a small deletion variant (rs10553596) in the coding region of caspase 7 gene (CASP7) was found to be significantly associated with reduced incidence of AD and dementia in APOE \u03b54 carriers. The protective effect of rs10553596 is observed in four independent LOAD cohorts. Interestingly, the protective effect of this CASP7 variant appears to be most significant in homozygous APOE \u03b54 carriers. At gene expression level, eQTL analysis indicated that the rs10553596 variant is correlated with lowered caspase 7 expression. These results provide new insights into the underlying genetic mechanism of AD as well as opportunities for novel therapeutic strategies."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study participants or study cohorts", "text": "We analyzed 6 datasets (Table 1) : Mount Sinai Biobank (~14 K individuals with genotype data), Geisinger Health System (GHS) MyCode Cohort (9856 unrelated individuals, [24] ), GBAD (1588 individuals, http://www.ncbi.nlm. nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs00021 9.v1.p1), ADNI (2826 individuals, http://adni.loni.usc.edu), ADSP (10,939 individuals, https://www.niagads.org/adsp/ content/home), and ADGC (6065 individuals, http:// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?stud y_id=phs000372.v1.p1).

The PCs were not statistically significant nor did they have a notable impact on the estimated odds ratio."}, {"section_title": "Results and discussion", "text": "Identification of genetic variants associated with reduced AD prevalence in APOE \u03b54 carriers\nWe first performed an exploratory analysis in the Mount Sinai Biobank to find protective alleles for APOE \u03b54 homozygotes, who are at high risk for AD. The SNP rs429358, used to determine APOE \u03b54 status, is well known for being difficult to genotype and failed QC on our array. The imputed genotypes were used to estimate the APOE \u03b54 status. Though this variant has overall high imputation quality, genotype imputation is more difficult in populations of African ancestry, due to lower linkage disequilibrium (LD) and higher genetic diversity. If we were to use a cutoff of genotype posterior probability > 0.9 for the imputed rs429358 SNPs, this would result in only 29 individuals above age of 60 being assigned as homozygous APOE \u03b54 carriers, of which only 2 were diagnosed with AD/dementia. We decided to use a loose threshold of genotype posterior probability (>0.5) for the APOE SNP rs429358 in order to increase sample size for a more powerful test of significance. We applied this threshold to all tested imputed variants. Using ICD9 billing codes for AD and dementia diagnosis (290, 294 and 331), we had 8 AD/dementia patients and 72 controls. With a one-sided Fisher's exact test, we found 12 annotated loss-of-function variants with p-value <0.05 that were protective for AD/dementia. The top two variants were in SLC22A24 (a putative ion transporter with unknown functional relevance to AD) and MUC19 (a gene known to give false positive associations due to its size). The third most significant variant was in CASP7, rs10553596, with an odds ratio of 0.080 and p-value of 0.0062. In this variant, two nucleotides (TT) is deleted in CASP7 coding region resulted in leucine to serine change at amino acid position 44 (mRNA accession: NM_001267057.1; protein accession: NP_001253986.1). In addition, the TT deletion causes a premature termination codon downstream at amino acid position 133. Therefore, it is highly likely this is a loss-of-function variant. The association of this variant to AD in the APOE \u03b54 heterozygotes (odds ratio = 0.75, p-value = 0.37) suggests that the protective effect of rs10553596 against AD in all APOE \u03b54 carriers might be present mainly in the APOE \u03b54 homozygous population. Rs10553596 is a relatively common variant in general population, with differing allele frequencies amongst the different 1000 genomes populations (Additional file 1: Figure S1 ). Next, we reinvestigated rs10553596 with a more stringent threshold for the imputed variants to determine if an association still holds. To increase the size of the test group, we performed a case-control analysis of genotypes between those diagnosed with AD or dementia and those without among APOE \u03b54 carriers. Using the combined posterior probability of homozygous and heterozygous rs429358 and the information from the other genotyped APOE SNP rs7412, we can be fairly confident whether or not an individual carries at least one copy of APOE \u03b54 (we can apply the same rational to the imputed variant CASP7 variant rs10553596 since we are analyzing a dominant model). With a cutoff for the combined posterior probability > 0.8, 842 individuals above age of 60 and in the top three largest ethnic groups were identified as APOE \u03b54 carriers (Table 2a) . As the control group, 3666 were identified as non-APOE \u03b54 carriers and are above age of 60 (Table 2b) . 50 of the 842 APOE \u03b54 carriers, and 157 of the 3666 individuals in the control group were diagnosed with AD or dementia. This represents an odds ratio of 1.4 fold for AD risk in APOE \u03b54 carriers. The result shows that presence of at least one copy of the rs10553596 alternate allele significantly lowers the AD risk (odds ratio = 0.56, p = 0.031) in APOE \u03b54 carriers (Table 2a) . However, when the same analysis was performed on non-APOE \u03b54 carriers, no significant association between rs10553596 and reduced AD risk was detected (Table 2b ) although a trend was observed. This suggests that rs10553596 is not protective for AD by its own, but is most likely a modifier for APOE \u03b54 alleles on AD risk."}, {"section_title": "Evaluation of rs10553596 as an AD protective variant", "text": "CASP7 encodes a member of the cysteine-aspartic acid protease (caspase) family. Sequential activation of caspases plays a central role in the execution-phase of cell apoptosis. However, the function of caspase 7 is beyond its role in apoptosis. For example, it has been illustrated that microglia cell activation by inflammatory signals are mediated through caspase cascade involving caspase 3 and caspase 7, without triggering apoptosis [29] . Microglial are resident immune cells in brain acting as the main form of immune response in central nervous system (CNS). Abnormal microglial activation causes neurotoxicity and plays a predominant role in both AD and Parkinson's disease (PD) pathogenesis. A recent study has shown that a LD haplotype block containing the CASP7 gene is associated with reduced AD risk in Caribbean Hispanic populations [30] .\nWe then attempted to replicate our findings in five independent cohorts (Table 1) . (1) The GBAD study [26, 31] , with French Canadian ancestry, (2) the ADNI study [32] , (3) the GHS MyCode study [24] , (4) the ADGC study [33] , and (5) the ADSP study (http://www.ncbi.nlm.-nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000572. v1.p1). We assigned each individual into one of the following three populations: APOE \u03b54 homozygotes, APOE \u03b54 heterozygotes and non-APOE \u03b54 carriers based on their APOE genotypes. For the ADSP WGS dataset, after genotype calling, we were left with only one APOE \u03b54 homozygote control, and thus the data was not included in the meta-analysis. Because these cohorts are of primarily of European ancestry, one can achieve higher accuracy of genotype imputation due to longer stretches of LD and lower genetic diversity. The protective effect of CASP7 variant rs10553596 was then assessed for individuals with genotype posterior probability of >0.9 for any genotype in each of the three sub-populations (APOE \u03b54 homozygotes, APOE \u03b54 heterozygotes and non-APOE \u03b54 carriers). The combined meta-analysis p-value (odds ratio) for these four cohorts was 0.004 (0.45) in homozygous APOE \u03b54 carriers (Fig. 1a) , indicating a significant protective effect of CASP7 rs1055359. In contrast, this protective effect of the rs10553596 variant is not observed in APOE \u03b54 heterozygotes (Fig. 1b) and non-carriers (Fig. 1c) .\nInterestingly, when we interrogated a centralized genetic variant repository (DIVAS) we built that included genotyping and sequencing data of 150,000 individuals from multiple disease cohorts [34] , we observed that allele frequency of rs10553596 is significantly lower in familial Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) at 5 % in comparison to 19-50 % in healthy populations (Additional file 1: Figure S2) , implicating a protective effect of this variant against ALS, another neuro-degenerative disease. The familiar ALS cohort was downloaded from dbGap with accession phs000101.v4.p1 [35, 36] . Although this observation requires further validation given rs10553596 is an indel variant and the technical challenges associated with indel calling, it is consistent with our findings on the protective effect of rs10553596 in LOAD. We further assessed the effect of the rs10553596 variant on CASP7 gene expression through eQTL analysis. As demonstrated in Table 3 , the alternate allele of rs10553596 is significantly associated with lowered CASP7 expression in the tissues we examined, including several brain tissues such as prefrontal cortex, visual cortex and cerebellum. This supports that rs10553596 is a loss of function variant for CASP7.\nAfrican American and Hispanic APOE \u03b54 carriers have a lower risk of developing Alzheimer's or dementia than European carriers. The allele frequencies of the CASP7 variant rs10553596 differ among the 1000 genomes ethnicities: 34-48 % in African populations, 21-32 % in South Figure S1 ). The higher allele frequency of rs10553596 in African populations might explain why APOE \u03b54 African Americans have a lower risk for Alzheimer's than Europeans [17] . It is identified in this study, possibly due to the unique composition of population in Mount Sinai Biobank with the majority being either African American or Hispanic [23] , although we were able to confirm the protective effect of rs10553596 against AD in four European cohorts. If we plot the frequency of rs10553596 versus the estimated APOE \u03b54 frequencies, we see a general positive correlation (r 2 = 0.42), which may reflect selective pressure (Additional file 1: Figure S1 ). We also realize that diversity of the frequency of this marker and the varying risks amongst ethnicities may inflate association due to subtle population stratification issues. While this is definitely a possibility in the Mount Sinai Biobank due to complex admixtures, it is far less likely to be a major factor in the more homogenous cohorts of European descent (principle component analysis supports this conclusion, see Methods).\nThe protective effect of rs10553596 against LOAD is only observed in APOE \u03b54 homozygote populations (Fig. 1) . It has been well documented that APOE binds to A\u03b2 and influences the clearance of soluble A\u03b2 and the A\u03b2 aggregation [4] . However it was unclear whether APOE genotype affects A\u03b2-plaque-associated neuro-inflammation until a recent study demonstrated that in addition to altering morphological profiles of A\u03b2 deposition, APOE genotype influences A\u03b2-induced glial activation in cortex [37] , a key step leading to neuro-inflammation in AD pathogenesis. Given the critical role of caspase 7 in microglial activation and recent findings implicating APOE \u03b54 alleles in modulating neuroinflammatory responses in AD development, it is only fitting that the loss-of-function alt allele of rs10553596 in CASP7 exhibited protective effect against AD in APOE high-risk \u03b54 carrier populations. Moreover, the protective effect of a CASP7 loss-of-function variant against AD only in APOE \u03b54 homozygotes may explain the clinical observation that anti-inflammatory interventions in AD show greater benefit in APOE \u03b54 carriers as opposed to non-carriers [38] . As pan-caspase inhibitors have been under development for several autoimmune diseases [39] , our discovery has potentially significant clinical relevance implicating novel therapeutic opportunities for AD.\nWe also recognize the limitations in our study. Limited sample size is an inherent challenge. Two of the 6 datasets, Mount Sinai Biobank and Geisinger Health System (GHS) MyCode Cohort, are population-based data that is not focused on AD. Therefore, the frequency of APOE \u03b54 homozygous carriers is equal to the popula- steps throughout the analyses (see Methods) further reduced the sample size. In addition, there are a significantly smaller number of AD patients than controls. In contrast, the 4 AD datasets (GBAD, ADNI, ADGC and ADSP) have significantly larger number of AD patients than controls among APOE \u03b54 homozygous carriers since the APOE \u03b54 allele is enriched in AD populations. Unbalanced AD vs. control sample size poses a great challenge to achieve the level of statistical significance reported in typical GWAS studies with balanced case vs. control populations of thousands to tens of thousands in sample size. Even with an original sample size of nearly 40,000 individuals, we were left with <1000 homozygous APOE \u03b54 individuals for the metaanalysis (Table 1 ; Fig. 1 ). Another limitation is that we define age 60, a commonly used threshold as a cutoff for LOAD. It is likely that some of the individuals in the control population will develop AD as they age. Therefore, our analyses suggest that the CASP7 variant rs10553596 protects against AD or simply delays the age of onset. As more AD genotyping and genomic sequencing data from large consortium become available, we can define a more stringent age threshold or use age of onset as a quantitative trait in an AD population to distinguish these possibilities."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "In this study, we analyzed individuals who are APOE \u03b54 risk allele carriers but are resilient to Alzheimer's disease, and discovered a novel AD protective genetic variants modifying AD risk in APOE \u03b54 risk allele carriers. Our analysis of Mount Sinai Biobank cohort led to the identification of a likely loss-of-function variant rs10553596 in CASP7 associated with significantly reduced AD incidence in elder populations. The protective effect of rs10553596 against AD was observed in four independent cohorts of European descent with similar odds ratios, and the overall effect in these cohorts was statistically significant. In addition, we show rs10553596 is associated in cis with lowered caspase 7 gene expression. Taken together, these results are consistent with the notion that caspase 7 plays a critical role in mediating microglial activation in CNS that triggers neurotoxicity and AD pathogenesis."}]
