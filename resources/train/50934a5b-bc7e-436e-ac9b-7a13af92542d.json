[{"section_title": "", "text": "Research on the professional development and success of academics has consistently shown the important and crucial role of mentoring. Despite the prominent role that the mentoring process plays in the academic development of graduate students and the professional mobility of new faculty, empirical data on mentoring -especially where African American scholars are concerned-is scarce. In this article, I use an original and unique data set to explore the role that mentoring plays in the academic development of recently minted African American doctorates (or Ph.D.s). 1 The study is divided into three parts. The first part provides descriptive data on the recent, African American doctorates (or Ph.D.s) who served as participants for the study. The second part provides an overview of the mentoring literature and explains my own theoretical contribution to the concept of mentoring as a fivefold typology. This typology categorizes the type of mentoring experiences in which African American doctorates (or Ph.D.s) are involved. The third and final aspect reviews the findings and, subsequently, discusses them within the broader issue of incorporation and the future of African American doctoral (or Ph.D.) holders."}, {"section_title": "RECENTLY MINTED AFRICAN AMERICAN DOCTORATES", "text": "In the past, little has been known about the emerging group of African American sociologists. However, a study titled \"The Survey of the Characteristics and Dimensions of Mentoring-An Investigation of the Mentoring Experiences of African American Graduate Students in Departments of Sociology\" does provide a much needed glimpse into the career trajectories of this talented group of minority scholars (Dixon-Reeves, 2001). The data set for the study is presented as they were self-reported (or originally) in 2000. Recent African American doctorates tend to have highly educated parents. For example, their fathers and mothers are likely to have college degrees, in fact, many of them may even have graduate degrees. Such recent Ph.D. holders tend to have between one and two siblings, who also tend to be highly educated as well. Many of the siblings have graduate degrees or are currently in pursuit of college and advanced degrees. Although many of the recent Ph.D.s are unmarried, those who are married have highly educated spouses. Almost all the spouses of recent Ph.D.s have graduate and/or professional degrees. As noted in the research for this study, all the recent Ph.D.s report being steadily employed. This should be encouraging news to the current group of graduate students that are matriculating in doctoral programs. Of the recent Ph.D.s, 68% are currently employed in full-time positions. They are employed primarily in an educational capacity-in research, teaching, administration, or in governmental positions. Of the recent Ph.D.s, 32% were completing postdoctoral fellowships before pursuing an academic, research, entrepreneurial, or governmental career. The recent Ph.D.s primarily financed their graduate education through the use of fellowships and scholarships. The primary source for supplementing the remaining cost of their graduate education was through teaching assistantships. Loans, research assistantships, and other part-time work were secondary sources of school financing. The salaries of recent Ph.D.s were on average between $40,000 and $59,999 yearly. Those recent Ph.D.s who were working as postdoctorate research or teaching fellows received on average between $20,000 and $39,999 yearly. Table 1 presents additional data on the characteristics of recent African American Ph.D.s. These data show that most African American recent Ph.D.s in sociology are women (73%) with men being the minority (27%). These data are consistent with other empirical data that foreshadows the gradual feminization of the entire discipline of sociology (McFalls, Engle, & Gallagher, 1999). Table 1 also illustrates that recent Ph.D.s are not evenly distributed by age, and they tend to be relatively young. More than 80% of the recent Ph.D.s are in their 30s; 78% of them are less than 35 years of age. This is potentially good news for recruitment committees because it means that these young academics could potentially serve in the academy 30 years. More than one half of the recent Ph.D.s report their primary research interests to be in race and ethnic relations or education. Social psychology, family policy, and social policy were also frequently cited areas of research interests. Inclusive of these general research areas are a host of specializations that include but are not limited to gang crime, history of African American education, gender roles, income stratification, Black church, religion, adolescence, health care, aging, and demography."}, {"section_title": "MENTORING EXPERIENCES", "text": "Mentoring has been classically defined as a process by which persons of superior rank, special achievements, and prestige As a result of the more detailed typology, one of the most important findings of the mentoring study is that African American graduate students and recent doctorates in sociology are, indeed, exposed to some type of mentoring experience. Data on previous cohorts of African American doctorates had reported no more than 12% of their respondents having access to a mentor (Blackwell, 1983;Holland, 1993;Howard-Vital & Morgan, 1993;Stewart, 1994). In contrast, this study demonstrates that 97% of recent Ph.D.s (33) reported having a mentor. Only one recent, male Ph.D. reported being self-mentored. This person reported getting letters of recommendation from the dissertation chair, the chair of the department, and the chair of the division. This Ph.D. recipient reported getting a great deal of administrative support and program advice from the administrative secretary but felt as if no particular faculty member had mentored him. He did acknowledge receiving assistance from a junior faculty person while preparing for his comprehensive exams and qualifying papers. The rest of the recent Ph.D.s reported having a mentor, and 74% reported having more than one mentor. When multiple mentors were reported, they were often classified very differently. The data suggests that the recent Ph.D.s are sophisticated in their use of mentors and relied on different mentors to provide different functions. For example, one mentor provided encouragement and emotional support whereas another provided extensive critique of drafts for publication submission. Even when multiple mentors were reported, the majority of recent Ph.D.s identified their primary mentor as being a coach (44%). This suggests that although the recent Ph.D.s relied on a variety of mentors, there was a single mentor who stood apart from the rest in providing the most comprehensive of support to the mentee. The remaining recent Ph.D.s identified their mentors as being role models (17%), advisers (15%), sponsors (12%), and peer counselors (6%)."}, {"section_title": "MENTOR CHARACTERISTICS", "text": "The following is a composite description of the primary mentors for recent Ph.D.s. The primary mentor is likely to be an African American man, 20 or more years older than the mentee. Most primary mentors are also tenured faculty members inside of the department and have known the respondent between 6 and 10 years. When the mentee indicated a second mentor, that person was also likely to be an African American man, between 10 and 19 years older than the recent Ph.D., a tenured faculty member inside the department, and had known the respondent for 6 to 10 years. The recent Ph.D. mentee's experiences with mentors mirrored the mentoring experiences of all of the participants in this study. African American men were disproportionately the primary mentors of all African American graduate students and recent Ph.D.s."}, {"section_title": "RELATIONSHIP WITH MENTOR", "text": "There are many benefits of participating in a mentoring relationship. This study focused on the career-enhancing supports provided by the relationship. The recent Ph.D.s consistently reported receiving more career-enhancing benefits than emotional and purely advisery academic supports. Table 2 illustrates the benefits of participation to the recent Ph.D.s. The types of career-enhancing benefits reported most often include letters of recommendation, critiques of papers and presentations, and career advice. However, more than one half of the recent Ph.D.s report other benefits of the relationship being guidance through the university and departmental bureaucracy; assistance getting teaching, research, or graduate assistanceships and/or fellowships; emotional support; and introductions to potential work contacts. Although this, intuitively, does seem to be a function of their current academic standing as recent Ph.D.s, it would appear that while they were graduate students they received increased careerenhancing benefits from their mentor relationship. Table 3 illustrates the scholarly activities they were encouraged to participate in by their mentors while they were yet graduate students. The data indicate that more than one half of all recent Ph.D.s were encouraged by their mentors to submit articles, chapters, and book reviews for publication; serve as a research assistant; and present their work at a local or national conference. These promptings were part of a strategic plan to have the mentee engage in professional development activities that would enhance their career marketability. The recent Ph.D.s cited this participation in networking and other professional development opportunities as a part of their ongoing professional development activities. They self-report high rates of participating at department-level colloquiums and/or symposiums, presenting papers at local and/or national conferences, and serving as discussants or moderators at conferences. Consequently, the recent Ph.D. mentees rated highly the job search strategies inherent in the aforementioned mentoring relationships. They rated the mentor relationship as being very important in helping them find a job and providing them with introductions to scholars in their primary and subsequent areas of research. They credited their mentors as being invaluable in providing letters of recommendations, developing a career strategy, and finishing their graduate school program. This data supports and provides "}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "This study began with the goal of providing much-needed information about the mentoring experiences of recently minted African American doctorates (Ph.D.s). Unlike most other studies, which relied heavily on anecdotal data and predominantly White samples of academics, this study used a recent and original data set to explore the types of mentoring relationships that recent African American doctorates (Ph.D.s) have with a viable mentor. The previous section outlined a variety of important findings. This section will focus on a discussion of the effects of the dramatic increase in the number of African American females into the discipline of sociology and ultimately the possibility of their incorporation in the academy. A 1999 profile of sociologists reveals that most sociologists are men (69%), although women constitute an increasing minority (31%) (McFalls et al., 1999). The data showed that while men substantially outnumber women in the field today, this will change in the near future. Women presently constitute the majority of sociologists under the age of 40. One can easily speculate that within the next 20 to 30 years, sociology will transition from a predominately White male discipline to a predominately White female discipline. The fate of African American sociologists appears to be following the same trend. The female respondents to the Mentoring Study greatly outnumber the males in the sample. These figures are representative of the disproportionate number of females to males in graduate school as confirmed in previous students and reports (NSF Survey of Earned Doctorates; ASA listing of Graduate Schools and Departments). The increase in the number of African American females into the discipline will have two profound effects. First, one can expect the increase in African American women to result in a gradual shift in the scholarship of this group to encompass more issues that are relative to and of interest to women. Second, and more important, the increase in women will likely negatively reduce the quality and quantity of mentoring that African American graduate students in sociology receive because both male and female African American graduate students reported receiving the bulk of and their best mentoring from African American male faculty. With the increase of African American female sociologists, one can expect a theoretical shift in research agendas to be more inclusive of issues that are of relevance to female researchers. One can anticipate an increase in genderized and feminist perspectives, including more research on gender roles, sexual politics, selfdefinition, family structures, motherhood, social activism, health care, social and economic inequality, aging, and education. Many people would argue that the addition of genderized and feminist perspectives to the broader research of sociology and an increase in the individual research agendas of African American sociologists as a good thing. They would see this as a positive addition to the research agendas and publication scholarship of the profession. They would argue that a discipline such as sociology with such a rich tradition of investigating issues of race/ethnicity, equality, status and educational attainment, and gender relations should have been more inclusive years ago. Although this may be true, one should expect to see a backlash to this type of scholarly work. One should expect there to be an even further marginalization of the work of African Americans and African American female scholars than already exists. It has been well documented that African American faculty members whose scholarship focuses on racial/ethnic and gender issues find their work devalued and dismissed as being out of the mainstream, polemic, peripheral, and self-serving (Allen, Epps, Guillory, Suh, & Bonous-Hammarth, 2000;Bourguignon et al., 1987;Collins, 2000;Epps, 1998). Although the discipline will be forced (by our entry) to become more inclusive of our scholarly contributions to the pro-fession, the work itself can be expected to decrease in value as the discipline's status diminishes if it is perceived as being \"too feminine\" and/or \"too ethnic.\" Perhaps the more disturbing trend that an increase in African American female sociologists suggests is that African American graduate students in departments of sociology will not have access to the quality and quantity of mentoring they have enjoyed in recent years. The data from this mentoring study suggests that African American male faculty consistently provided African American graduate students with more career-enhancing benefits and supports than any other ethnic or gender combination of mentor. African American women were the fourth most reported mentors of African American graduate students. They were ranked behind White men and White women. Latino, Asian, and Native American faculty serve in miniscule numbers as mentors to African American graduate students. This can be attributed to their low representation among the sociology faculty rather than their having a disinterest in serving as mentors. African American male graduate students, like the recent Ph.D.s presented in this article, were more likely to have two African American men as their primary and secondary mentors. African American male graduate students were least likely to have an African American female mentor. Respondents with African American male faculty as mentors reported receiving more encouragement to participate in scholarly activities, were offered more opportunities to serve as research assistants, were offered more opportunities to coauthor, and were encouraged to participate in independent research projects at disproportionately higher rates than participants with other mentors."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "One can speculate on the reasons that African American female academics do not mentor graduate students at the same rate as African American men. It could easily be a result of the increased burden of familial and household duties that female academics have in addition to their scholarly responsibilities. These responsibilities, coupled with the demands of teaching, service, and scholarship, do not leave much time for the additional responsibility of mentoring. It could also be that African American female sociologists are not called on to serve as mentors at the same rate as African American men. It could, as well, be that African American male faculty members reach out to African American graduate students at higher rates than their female counterparts. Whatever the reason, if the trend in mentoring quantity and quality continues, the end result will be that African American graduate students in sociology will not receive the high level of mentoring that they have experienced in the past if there is an increase in African American female sociologists and a decrease in African American male sociologists. These are, by no means, pronouncements of gloom and doom. They do, however, point to some important issues that need to be addressed. African American scholars-male and female-as well as Caucasian and other ethnic scholars need to continue to fight against attempts to marginalize their research and to devalue their service and activist contributions to the academy and their surrounding communities. They should continue to pursue their personal areas of research and submit them to the appropriate refereed journals, whether they are mainstream or specialty ones. They should continue to work actively and aggressively within their departments, their universities, and their local and national organizations to put pressure to change the institutional racism that exists at all levels of these institutions. African American male and female sociologists must make a renewed commitment to mentor African American graduate students. This should not be misconstrued to suggest that they not also actively mentor students of other ethnicities. They should, and as suggested by the experiences of the recent Ph.D.s and previous literature, they are regularly called on to do just that. Nor should this be misconstrued to suggest that other race and gender mentors not mentor African American graduate students. Effective mentoring should have no gender or ethnic boundaries. The problem, as suggested by the data, is that if African American scholars do not take the time to mentor African American grad-uate students, African American graduate students may not get mentored at all. This could be particularly detrimental to African American male graduate students. African American female mentors will need to make room in their already overcrowded schedules, to be effective mentors for male and female African American graduate students. All mentors, regardless of gender or ethnicity, need to engage their students in more scholarly professional development activities so that they are adequately prepared to obtain positions in the institutions of their choice. Effective mentoring is the key to professional development, publication, tenure, and advancement through the ranks in academia. Without it, the advancement of African American doctorates (Ph.D.s) will diminish significantly, and true incorporation will remain as an unrealized dream."}, {"section_title": "APPENDIX", "text": "Data for the study were obtained by using a confidential questionnaire that was distributed to nonrandomly sampled African American graduate students and recent doctoral (Ph.D.) recipients in earmarked departments of sociology. The descriptive survey was used to obtain a picture of the types of mentoring activities engaged in, collect demographic information on the respondents and their mentors, and begin to investigate the relationship between mentor type and the respondents'engagement in the scholarly activities of research, publishing, and teaching. The study began with a purposive sample employing nonrandom snowball sampling techniques to recruit potential respondents to the study. To be in the sample, the respondents had to be African American and currently enrolled in or had recently completed or received a Ph.D. in sociology (within 1 to 3 years). The core selection variable was race, and the secondary selection variable was being a graduate student or a recently conferred Ph.D. in sociology. The 109 registered graduate student members of the Association of Black Sociologists in 2000 were the core sample.
