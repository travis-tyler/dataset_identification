[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Background: A number of large-scale population studies have provided valuable information about physical performance in aged individuals; however, there is little information about trajectories of function and associations with age across the adult life span. We developed a mobilityfocused physical performance screener designed to be appropriate for the adult life span. Methods: The physical performance battery includes measures of mobility, strength, endurance, and balance. Physical activity (PA) was assessed with accelerometry. We examined age-related trends in physical performance and PA, and the relationship between physical performance and PA across the age range (30-90+), by decade, in 775 participants enrolled in the study 2012-2014. Results: Physical performance was worse with increasing age decade. Although men performed better than women across all ages, the decrement by age group was similar between genders. Worsening physical performance was observed as early as the fifth decade for chair stands and balance and in the sixth decade for gait speed and aerobic endurance. The number and strength of significant associations between physical performance and PA increased with greater age: the greatest number of significant associations was seen in the 60-79 age groups, with fewer reported in the 30-59 and 80-90+ age groups. More PA was associated with better physical function. Conclusion: These results emphasize the importance of a life span approach to studies of function and aging. This work points to the need for a physical performance screener that spans across adulthood as a clinical tool for identifying functional decline."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "Physical performance (eg, strength, endurance, balance) is a key contributor to late-life mobility and independence (1) (2) (3) . There is much research on physical performance in large, prospective studies of older populations, however, there is growing evidence that the onset of chronic disease burden-and the negative lifestyle behaviors that contribute to these diseases-occur earlier in the life span (4) . The American College of Sports Medicine (5, 6) suggests that early detection and treatment of functional decline plays a critical role in preventing or delaying the onset of functional impairment and physical disability. Studies that examine elements of life-span health in both younger and older adults are needed to establish trajectories of physical performance across the adult life span.\nThe patterns of age-related decline, and the age at which decreases in physical performance can first be detected, have not been widely investigated. Two notable exceptions are the InCHIANTI study and the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA), which included performance-based tests of mobility and muscle strength among adults 20+ years of age (7, 8) . The primary obstacle to studying physical performance in young and older adults concurrently is the significant heterogeneity in fitness capacity among these groups. To examine functional pathways across the adult life span requires a battery of physical performance tests that are broadly age-and ability-appropriate, sensitive to change, and without floor or ceiling effects. These tests then can be used to compare group estimates and changes across a wide range of ages and ability levels (9) . After a review of the literature and a number of consultations with internal experts and external discussions, we selected five physical performance tests that assess domains of mobility including gait, balance, aerobic endurance, and lower body strength. Each of these tests has previously demonstrated reliability and sufficient discrimination in a variety of populations. Finally, each of these tests is scored along a continuous scale, minimizing floor and ceiling effects.\nTo address the deficiencies in published work, we obtained objective measures of physical performance and physical activity (PA) in an adult cohort ages 30 years and above (90+), in a study designed to examine patterns of age-related differences in physical performance and the associations between physical performance, PA, and age across the adult life span."}, {"section_title": "Design and Methods", "text": "This study, the Physical Performance Across the Life-span Study, is a nested study derived from The Measurement to Understand the Reclassification of Disease Of Cabarrus/Kannapolis (MURDOCK) Study.

In general, the onset of divergence by age group was observed as early as the fifth and sixth decades. For physical performance there was stability in the first two decades of adulthood, and decrements in the middle years (50+) and late adulthood. For PA, decrements between age groups were largest in later adulthood (60+) and smaller at younger ages. Thus, physical declines in function and PA were much greater during late adulthood than during the younger years. Our results lend further support for interventions in younger cohorts, targeting the risk factors for late-life disability earlier in the life span in an effort to prevent, attenuate, or delay functional decline (26) ."}, {"section_title": "How do These Results Compare With Other Studies?", "text": "Compared with published age-related norms (9, 16, 19) , this study sample performed at, or above, average on all physical performance measures. Because so few data have been published on physical performance in early and middle adulthood, similar comparisons of performance and changes over the years cannot be made for these tests. Additionally, the inconsistent methodology in assessing physical performance across studies limits our ability to compare this sample with other cohort samples. However, our results and the observed age-related trends in the 60-80+ age groups are similar to previous reports of function in older adults (9, 16, 19, 27, 28) .\nOverall, adults in all age groups accumulated very high levels of sedentary-light behavior (10-15 h/d), which is consistent with other reports in comparably aged adults (29) (30) (31) . The proportion of wear time in sedentary-light behavior (96% average), and time spent in MVPA that we observed, was higher compared with other studies (23, 29) .

First, although waist-mounted accelerometers are excellent tools for monitoring ambulatory activity, they do not account for differences in cardiorespiratory fitness levels, which are strong predictors of outcomes in almost all cohorts examined (38) . Second, there have been few published studies exploring the impact of gait disability/slow gait speed on the association between energy expenditure and accelerometer output. One study reported that walking speed is strongly and significantly correlated with accelerometer output and oxygen cost of walking in older adults (39) , which may contribute to the differences in PA intensity we observe between age groups in this study. Second, caution is warranted in interpreting these results relative to the general population, as we used unweighted analytic models and this is a self-referred group that seems to have high function, limiting the generalizability of this sample. Third, this is a cross-sectional analysis, and the age-related trends observed do not reflect longitudinal change over time. The authors recognize that these age-related trends might be, at least partially, explained by the presence of a cohort effect.

This work greatly advances the field by developing a performance-based physical function screener that is suitable for adults of all ages and provides objective functional data not traditionally found in epidemiologic studies. Our examination of these factors in a broad sample of community-dwelling adults as opposed to select sub-groups of individuals (eg, clinic patients, those with specific chronic diseases, adults in a narrow age range), makes these results generalizable to a large segment of the adult population.
