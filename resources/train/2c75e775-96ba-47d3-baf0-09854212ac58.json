But see Eisenberg, supra note 13, at 1680 (noting that data was flawed because institutions could elect title in inventions funded by the Department of Defense). 209 See ISAACSON, supra note 191, at 215 (\"Innovation requires having at least three things: a great idea, the engineering talent to execute it, and the business savvy (plus deal-making moxie) to turn it into a successful product.\" Furthermore, the government is too remote both geographically (from campuses) and socially (from the originating scientists) to be well-positioned to take advantage of research innovations developed at campuses all over the country. 214 The lack of local expertise familiar with the technology impairs the possibility of commercialization for the invention. It was not merely the ownership of inventions for which the government took a counterproductive approach. The parameters of invention ownership were also of utmost importance. Perhaps the most harmful position the government took with regard to commercializing research inventions was the prohibition on exclusive licensing. 215 By 28 (\"There is so much stuff on the shelf that isn't being used.\") (quoting National Weather Service Director Nezette Rydell on weather prediction technology). 213 representatives argued that universities were better conduits for technology transfer than agencies because they were more familiar with the inventions and had direct access to faculty inventors. In particular, universities could facilitate the direct interaction between inventors and licensees that is often critical to technology transfer.\") (footnotes omitted); Juan Alc\u00e1cer & Wilbur Chung, Location Strategies and Knowledge Spillovers, 53 MGMT. SCI. 760, 760 (2007) (\"Because knowledge is partially tacit and localized, its transfer requires frequent interaction that proximity facilitates.\"). 215 See Ashley J.

In the context of IP, a license is permission to use the rights associated with that IP. Licensing Agreement, BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY (10th ed. 2014). Licenses may be exclusive, unique to the licensee, or nonexclusive, by which the licensor could grant permission to multiple parties. Exclusive License, Non-exclusive License, BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY (10th ed. 2014). removing the incentive prompting commercialization efforts, the government had deterred the effort and thus the successful implementation of inventions. 216 Without any possibility of benefiting from the profits, 217 Gatorade's inventors would likely not have expended the effort to market and sell the beverage. 218 If the government had owned the electrolyte solution, Kent Bradley would not have introduced his former colleagues and Gatorade to Stokely while at Indiana. 219 This profit-motive rationale is the same that underlies the entire patent system. 220 At the expense of oversimplification, tech transfer ordinarily occurs by licensing the IP associated with a research innovation to one (exclusive) or more (non-exclusive) companies or licensing it to a startup or spinout company. See KYLE WELCH, SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY FOUNDERS MANUAL: A GUIDE TO RESOURCES FOR ENTREPRENEURSHIP & THE COMMERCIALIZATION OF IDEAS 34 (2019) (\"Although it is not exactly a binary choice, most ideas from university settings are commercialized in one of two ways: 1. Licensed to an existing company; or 2. Created as the core idea of a new startup company.\"). In the case of Gatorade, the inventors exclusively licensed the rights in their IP (likely trademark, trade secret, and patent) to Stokely in exchange for royalties on products, relying in part on those IP rights. See supra Part III. 216 Gatorade and Patent Policy, supra note 151, at 143 (describing \"greater rights to Government-financed inventions to private contractors . . . a necessary incentive for commercialization.\"). 217 As of 1991, Gatorade inventors earned about $8 million in royalties. Grassmuck, supra note 125. 218 See ROVELL, supra note 3, at 55 (\"When [Dr. Cade] talked about how much money his product would be earning, it was his way of expressing his pride in how successful his product would one day become.\"); Rogin, supra note 17 (\"Of course, I wouldn't spend all of [the money from Gatorade] on medicine. My wife wants a couch and I'd like to have another violin and I'd love to get a Porsche 911 for Mike Pickering to race.\"). But see ROVELL, supra note 3, at 55 (\"[T]here was never any evidence to show that Cade was particularly enamored with money.\"). 219 See, e.g., supra notes 118-20. 220  On the other hand, the court melee over Gatorade was an example of what could go wrong without a national IP policy promoting uniformity 223 and certainty 224 for research inventions. While the government eased the zeal with which it clung to ownership of research inventions in the 1960s, 225 still no coherent national policy existed on which university contractors could rely.

In 1973, President Richard Nixon released a memo on patent policy granting federal agencies the discretion to allow universities to own inventions and grant exclusive licenses, 227 building momentum on suggestions from the Kennedy administration that agencies grant title in patents to contractors such as universities. 228 Nevertheless, this waiver system was still uncertain and insufficient. 229 As the 1970s progressed, national concerns grew about U.S. economic vitality and industrial competitiveness with countries such as Japan. 230 As a result of the economic consternation, the underutilization 227 Memorandum of August 23, 1971: Government Patent Policy, 36 Fed.

After Gatorade became the \"official sports drink\" of the NFL, 271 Stokely insisted that the players use cups and coolers branded with the Gatorade logo 272 -the orange coolers with white tops and green cups with the lightning bolt are today instantly recognizable to any former amateur or professional athlete. 273 Partially motivated by the desire to acquire Gatorade, 274 Quaker Oats Co. (Quaker) purchased Stokely in 1983, and with it the license to the sports drink. 275 Gatorade continued to grow in popularity throughout the 1980s and 1990s thanks to some viral moments 276 and splashy marketing. 277 For instance, consider how a sideline prank became a free national advertisement and feel-good story associated with the brand. On October 20, 1985, as retribution for a week of harassment from head coach Bill Parcells, 278 New York Giants defensive tackle Jim Burt dumped one of the team's Gatorade buckets on Parcells following a victory against Washington. 279 The \"Gatorade shower\" became a tradition for the Giants, who drenched their coach after many victories in the 1985 and 1986 seasons. 280 The Giants overturned the cooler on Parcells following their Super Bowl XXI victory in January 1987, which USA TODAY later named the 42nd greatest Super Bowl moment of all time. 281 The Gatorade shower remains such an iconic tradition 282 -especially in football-that betting on what color players dump on the winning Super Bowl coach has become a popular gambling proposition. 283 The ritual has such intrinsic marketing value 284 that 276 See Viral Marketing, DICTIONARY.COM, https://www.dictionary.com/browse/ viral-marketing (last visited Apr. 19, 2020) (n., \"a marketing strategy that focuses on spreading information and opinions about a product or service from person to person, especially by using unconventional means such as the Internet or email.\"); see also ROVELL, supra note 3, at 91 (\"The Gatorade dunk basically meant we had arrived.

In 1991, Gatorade scored another marketing coup by winning a competition against Coca-Cola for the endorsement of Michael Jordan, 289 two-time MVP 290 and two-time league champion 291 for the Chicago Bulls of the National Basketball Association (NBA). 292 A photo of Jordan, a lifelong Gatorade drinker, 293 dunking from the free throw line in the 1988 Slam Dunk Contest (sponsored by Gatorade) would become iconic in sports and pop culture. 294 After that, posters of Jordan's dunk accompanied by the Gatorade logo 295 became a fixture in dorm rooms and dens all over the country. 296 By the mid-1990s, Jordan was the most popular athlete in the United States and possibly the most recognizable person in the world. 297 Behind the success of its \"Be Like Mike\" advertising campaign with Jordan, 298 Gatorade outsold Quaker's signature oatmeal 299 for the first time in 1991. 300 In 2000, PepsiCo (Pepsi) acquired Quaker, 301 making it a foundational licensed product for one of the world's three largest mitigate weight loss when he lost \"as much as five pounds in water weight per game\" in the NBA). 294 See Mike Fiammetta, Walter Iooss Jr. Discusses Classic Michael Jordan Photo, SPORTS ILLUSTRATED (Feb. 27, 2015), https://www.si.com/nba/2015/ 02/17/walter-iooss-jr-michael-jordan-1988-nba-dunk-contest-photo (\"The result was among the most ubiquitous photos of Jordan . . . .\").

Describing Gatorade and other inventions as \"low-tech\" is not intended to slight the scientific acumen required to create such inventions or overcome technical hurdles to develop it, but only the perception that such ideas are unsophisticated. See, e.g., supra notes 355 (describing Dr. Cade a \"unique genius\"); Rogin, supra note 79 (describing how the glucose initially \"turned into rock\" rather than dissolving into the water). 341 See supra Part II (listing the initial ingredients of Gatorade as water, glucose, sodium, and potassium); see also Karapapa, supra note 332, at 329 (describing the Post-it note as \"a piece of stationery consisting of a small piece of paper with readherable stirp of adhesive on the back.\"). 342 Gatorade was initially targeted at only the collegiate and professional athlete, then the hyper-active consumer. See supra note 154. Consumers quickly seized upon it for other applications. See, e.g., supra note 265; e.g., Rogin, supra note 17 (alcohol mixer); id. (hangover cure); see also id. (explaining Gatorade could be of value to soldiers, those working in engine or furnace rooms, racehorses, and the UF choir); see also, e.g., ISAACSON, supra note 191, at 226 (discussing how key developments in the creation of the internet were initially devised for air defense systems). \u2022 Avoid costly hurdles where possible; 343 \u2022 Identify the profound public benefit that can result from quaint research innovations. 344 The Gatorade saga's lessons of what not to do when commercializing a research idea include the following: \u2022 Have unclear ownership policies at the national or institutional level; 345 \u2022 Lack standardized processes through which researchers can disclose or otherwise share inventions and creations with the university; 346 343 See ROVELL, supra note 3, at 23, 58-62 (reviewing rejection of the name Gator-Aid to avoid potential need for regulatory approval and reformulation to eliminate FDA-banned cyclamate). 344 See Rogin, supra note 17 (arguing that Gatorade has \"substantially improved not only the lot of the Florida football team but that of all sweaty mankind.\"); e.g., id.

Oddly enough, a 1991 dispute over a new beverage line, similar to Gatorade, debatably subject to Florida's updated patent policies would revive the 1970 dispute and spring from such an assignment document. See Andrews, supra note 119 (\"According to court papers filed last April reopening the 1970 litigation, Bank One contends that one of the doctors, J. Robert Cade, bypassed the trust in assigning rights to the new drink to the University of Florida Research Foundation, an Independent fund-raising arm of the university.\"). 346 See ROVELL, supra note 3, at 65 (\"In December 1966 . . . . Cade was urged by an executive at the University of Florida to report his invention-more than fourteen months after it had been conceived.\"). Another administrative measure is a university committee that reviews ownership issues and commercial potential of technologiesto act as a decision-making buffer for the administration. See, e.g., Andrews, supra note 119 (\"What [disputes over successful technology transfer] requires is better upfront review and upfront strategy so you don't get into these legal problems [like that surrounding Gatorade] five years later.\"); Williams, supra note 21 (\"Faculty members are required to disclose all inventions to a university committee that reviews the potential to obtain a patent and the commercial prospects of the invention, [Donald] Price[, Dir., UF Off.

(estimating that the University of Indiana missed out on $95 million in revenues from a fluoride compound licensed to Procter & Gamble used in Crest toothpaste). 349 See Williams, supra note 21 (\"Gatorade was developed in 1965 when many universities were ill equipped to judge the commercial potential of ideas emerging from their research labs. Officials blew the university's chance to control the Gatorade royalties when they declined to develop a professor's idea. . . .

See ISAACSON, supra note 191, at 462. 350 However, it is likely that a highly successful commercial product will attract litigation because of the financial stakes, and in other cases litigation may be necessary to extract value from the idea if firms are infringing on the idea while evading royalties. See, e.g., ROVELL, supra note 3, at 67 (discussing how Dr. Cade's was told to expect multiple law suits per year); see also, e.g., Genentech, Inc. v. Eli Lilly & Co., 998 F.2d 931 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (lawsuit over recombinant DNA in which the Regents of the University of California were codefendants). 351 See Andrews, supra note 119 (\"The wrangling [in court for Gatorade] underscores the importance of forethought in technology transfer.\") (citing Mel DeGeeter). While there are many examples where this again occurred, such mistakes usually ensure that a research invention will not be commercially successful, and many of the top research universities are sufficiently prepared to capitalize on a valuable idea. 352 See ROVELL, supra note 3, at 91 (\"There are things that happen serendipitously . . . .\") (quoting former Gatorade Executive Peter Vitulli). Dewayne Douglas was a coffee buddy of Dr. Cade's before approaching him with the Gators' \"dehydration problem.

Perhaps the most satisfying lesson from the Gatorade saga was how a commercially valuable, successfully transferred research product can create a \"virtuous cycle of tech transfer activity.\" 364 The royalties generated from a Gatorade can reinvigorate, nourish, and even BUS. & INTELL. PROP. L.\ntransform a university's research program through the reinvestment into future research efforts 365 -in fact, the terms of grants promulgated under the Bayh-Dole Act require it. 366 At the University of Florida, the tens of millions of dollars in royalties generated from Gatorade 367 have funded research programs, 368 built facilities, 369 and bankrolled incubators. 370 Gatorade has inspired a spirit of entrepreneurship and 365 As early as 1973, the Gatorade royalties were earmarked to fund kidney research, marine science, biological sciences, oceanography, and other health and education-oriented programs. \nand scientific challenges, 401 the propensity and desire in academia to share information via publication in scientific journals and presentations, 402 regulatory hurdles, 403 trouble identifying and securing a licensee, 404 lack of funding or access to capital, 405 failure identifying market interest, the inability or disinclination to bring infringement mechanisms of action, and universities may not have the resources or inclination to work out the practical implications of all such research . . . .\") (citation omitted); Marcus, supra note 364 (noting that \"technology transfer administrators say government grants typically don't cover\" proof-of-concept funding); Sobolski, supra note 365, at 1339 (\"Also, the institutional infrastructure around technology licensing requires paying skilled employees at higher wages . . . .\"); Wadman, supra note 250, at 830 (\"There are also problems with small staffs-the median size of a US TTO is six employees, and many others around the world are smaller.\"); see also, e.g., Marcus, supra note 364 (discussing an organization started by a former Stanford professor giving research innovations \"$50,000 a year for two years to create . . . proofs of concept\"); id.

Cir. 1985) (holding an orally presented paper was a \"printed publication\" under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102 and could serve as prior art). 403 E.g., Healy, supra note 220, at 379 (showing that initial commercialization efforts of Wi-Fi were hindered because regulatory authorities only allowed use of the technology at high frequencies). 404 See Marcus, supra note 364 (\"But you have to find somebody willing to pay money for [an invention], license it, develop it.\") (quoting a former staffer to Senator Bayh). 405 See BRYSON, supra note 332, at 46 (estimating that development of a new drug requires $3 billion). Some universities are taking measures to combat this challenge. See, e.g., Williams, supra note 21, at A26 (describing how Harvard's Medical Science Partners was created \"to find a way to close the funding gap between research and development\"); Marcus, supra note 364 (detailing how the University of Chicago and others \"have created their own multimillion-dollar funds to invest in early stage faculty startups\"). lawsuits, 406 and the banal administrative defects of bureaucracy. 407 There is also the general unpredictability about what is commercially viable and what will transpire in the wacky marketplace 408 -even Gatorade's initial licensee grossly underestimated its commercial potential. 409 Simply put, the commercialization of university research ideas is a complex process 410 with an infinite number of ways to fail. If there is a high probability of success, a company will likely undertake the effort itself rather than rely on a university to do the research at all. 411 One need not look further than the Gatorade tale to see the necessary steps that required a specific outcome for Gatorade to exist and succeed: Dewayne Douglas had to have a preexisting relationship with Dr. Cade, 412 Dr. Cade had to be available and interested in solving the problem, 413 Coach Graves had to be receptive to some doctors conducting experiments on his players, 414 the initial results had to be promising, 415 the football team had to perform spectacularly well after they started drinking Gatorade, 416 Dr. Cade's wife had to suggest adding lemon to improve the taste, 417 Gatorade had to receive an inordinate amount of publicity, 418 Kent Bradley had to relocate to the University BUS. & INTELL. PROP. L.\nof Indiana and interact with Stokely, 419 Stokely had to be a capable licensee and expend adequate resources to market Gatorade, 420 the market had to be ready for a product fit for the physically active and health-conscious consumer, 421 the litigation had to unfold in a way that allowed commercialization to continue unimpeded, Gatorade's early adopters had to win Super Bowls and sing its praises, 422 and a series of publicity boons had to work in Gatorade's favor for it to become the beverage powerhouse it is today. 423 Change the outcome of any one of those events and Gatorade likely does not become the commercial success it is today. Remove one of the events and no one outside Gainesville ever hears of it. 424 If the 1966 Florida Gators go 4-5-1 (as they did in 1961 425 ), the Gatorade on the shelf of 7/11 or the pallet at Costco likely disappears. 426 Other research ideas at universities face a similar fate and improbability of success. For this reason, it is wholly unrealistic for other universities to depend on or forecast the fortune that Gatorade has produced for the University of Florida. Most tech transfer offices still operate at a deficit. 427 Some of the policy changes from the Bayh-Dole Act, partially inspired by the Gatorade saga, have been of great benefit to the American economy. 428 Yet the positive impacts are produced by a disproportionate number of universities, leading to a very top-heavy picture in income from licensing university innovations. 429 Most of the universities that produce large amounts of revenue to help sustain their ongoing research are traditional research-intensive universities 430 or have a home run technology like Gatorade 431 that skew the perception of success-or at least the uniformity of that success. 432 At the expense of mixing sports metaphors, tech transfer and the commercialization of research are \"a bit like college football\" in that there are \"big-time programs that make a lot of money,\" but they are \"few and far most universities to duplicate. 457 Even if the economics are not in every university's favor, 458 the hope of a spectacular success like Gatoradecombined with more modest victories and the cumulative public benefit from research innovation-justifies the whole enterprise. 459 For this reason, the Gatorade saga is an important prototype for universities and the U.S. economy at large to use as a model 460 -as \"fuel of interest\" for the their own \"fire of genius.\" 461 Gatorade's lessons are vital ones for a modern, advanced economy like the United States that relies on knowledge-based industries for its economic competitiveness 462 and universities for its research, education, and innovation. 463 "}, {"section_title": "BORN IN THE LAB, PROVEN IN THE MARKET 287", "text": "water 75 without bloating. 76 But the scientists had to overcome a few design challenges to make an ingestible beverage.

See Memorandum of October 10, The government's position was principled enough: the public funded the inventions, so the public ought to own the inventions. 203 However, handling of \"public ownership\" was not clear-cut: inventions could be in the public domain (owned by no one and hence available to everyone) 204 or owned by the government on behalf of the public (the more common scenario), 205 two fundamentally different propositions (and justifications). 203 See Good, supra note 193, at 50 (\"It was assumed that the public good would be served by an approach where private industry could use the ideas published and the government could control the science and technology for its own use.\"); Walterscheid, supra note 193, at 124 (\"[A group of] Congressmen shared a basically populist view predicated on the argument that research which is funded by the taxpayer belongs to the taxpayer and should be in the public domain.\") (internal footnote omitted). 204 See Good, supra note 193, at 50 (\"[A]ny intellectual property discovered by government by university scientists funded by the government was either the property of the government or put into the public domain by publication of research results.\"). 205 See supra note 197 (agency ownership). 206 The justification for inventions in the public domain was that the public funded the invention, hence the public should have access.
