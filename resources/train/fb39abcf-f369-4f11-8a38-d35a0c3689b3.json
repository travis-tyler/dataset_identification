In this paper, we propose a diffusion model with impulsive sources over the brain connectivity network to model the progression of brain atrophy. To reliably estimate the atrophy sources, we impose sparse regularization on the source distribution and solve the inverse problem with an efficient gradient descent method. We localize the possible origins of Alzheimer's disease (AD) based on a large set of repeated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans in Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. The distribution of the sources averaged over the sample population is evaluated. We find that the dementia sources have different concentrations in the brain lobes for AD patients and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects, indicating possible switch of the dementia driving mechanism. Moreover, we demonstrate that we can effectively predict changes of brain atrophy patterns with the proposed model.

INTRODUCTION", "text": "A S a collective term describing various symptoms of cognitive decline that is severe enough to interfere with normal life, dementia is expected to affect 75.6 million people worldwide in 2030, compared with the current number 44.4 million. About 50% to 80% of dementia is due to Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disease with symptoms ranging from memory loss, trouble with language to the loss of bodily functions. So far, the cause and progression of AD are not well understood. Consequently, There is no treatment yet to stop or reverse the progression of the disease.\nTo reveal the pathology of AD, several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the mechanism of the disease. Among those hypotheses, the most influential ones are amyloid and tau hypotheses. They postulated that the disease begins in the gray matter with accumulation of misfolded beta-amyloid and/or tau protein and progresses along extant fiber pathways [1] , [2] . The progression of dementia results in gross atrophy of the affected brain regions, containing degeneration in the temporal lobe and parietal lobe, and parts of the frontal cortex and cingulate gyrus [3] .\nIn the brain structure and function study, network models have been used to evaluate the variation of brain connectivity due to diseases [4] - [7] . Moreover, dynamics of neurological disease progression could be described by diffusion processes on the brain network, inspired by the previous works on information diffusion in social networks [8] and sensor networks [9] . Recently, a network diffusion model [10] and an epidemic spreading model [11] have been put forward to characterize the propagation of brain atrophy and misfolded proteins in dementia. The transmission of disease agents like misfolded beta amyloid and tau protein was modeled as a diffusive mechanism mediated by the brain connectivity network [12] . Raj et al. predicted spatially distinct \"persistent modes\" capturing the patterns of dementia (including AD and frontotemporal dementia in their study) by the network diffusion model in [10] . Moreover, prevalence rates forecasted by the model strongly agreed with the published data. With this model, Raj et al. also predicted longitudinal atrophy patterns based on the current atrophy [13] . It was also demonstrated that network diffusion could accurately model the relationship between structural and functional brain connectivity networks [14] , which typically depict the neuron fiber connections and the functional correlation of the neuron units, respectively. In addition, the microscopic substance diffusion and related transport mechanisms in brain tissue justify the macroscopic diffusion over the brain connectivity network [15] . However, it is unclear whether the diffusion model without sources can capture nonlinear trajectories of brain diseases [10] , [13] .\nIn this work, we infer sources of dementia progression using a network diffusion model with sparse impulsive stimulations. The study of brain disease agents (i.e., prion-like proteins) attributed the cause of dementia to a few seed regions in the brain [16] , [17] . Based on this, we propose a new network diffusion model that not only describes the propagative nature of dementia, but also considers the dynamics of the seed effect. Particularly, we adopt a linear diffusive model mediated by the brain connectivity structure as an approximation to the nonlinear dynamics of the brain. Linearization reduces the model complexity and thus makes the parameter fitting more robust than that in nonlinear models. It also helps gain more insight before we try more complicated models. To account the effect of seeds, we introduce sparse impulsive stimulations arriving at different time points to those seed regions. Given the anatomical stucture of a brain network, we are interested in inferring the sources of dementia using longitudinal neuroimaging data of brain atrophy.\nIn practice, we fit the amplitudes of the input impulses and the diffusion speed to the observed data. By assuming that the stimulations arrive discretely, the fitting problem is transferred to a parametrized sparse linear regression problem. An iterative descent search algorithm is presented with a refinement step added later to improve the estimation of the diffusion speed. Numerical simulations demonstrate that we are able to recover the input impulses at the source nodes reliably. Next, we evaluate the longitudinal MRI data in ADNI using this model. MRI provides an noninvasive way to measure the changes of the brain anatomical structure. The shrinkage/atrophy of certain parts of the brain usually are indicators of dementia, such as AD and frontotemporal dementia. The Jacobian maps of the follow-up scans were generated via measuring the changes with respect to the screening scan. After this, we extract the average atrophy at each brain region from the Jacobian maps and infer the dementia source distributions of both AD patients and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) subjects.\nTwo primary differences between summarized source distributions of the AD group and MCI group are the lower contrast of the distribution and the denser sources in the temporal lobe for the MCI group. We find that the dementia progression is more evidently driven by a set of leading brain regions in AD than in MCI. Moreover, there is a shift of dominant dementia sources from the temporal lobe and cerebellum for MCI to the central brain regions, frontal lobe and the border between parietal lobe and occipital lobe for AD. This phenomenon is consistent with former findings in [18] , [19] . Since MCI subjects have high chances to develop AD, the different patterns of the source distributions between MCI and AD may indicate the evolution of the dementia progression mechanism. Part of the results have been presented in [20] . Since then we have significantly strengthened the theory, the simulation and real experimental results. Specifically, we provide a graph filtering interpretation of our work by defining signals and filtering operator on the brain network with the graph Laplacian matrix of the network. In the simulation study, we have considered noise and obtained Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves to evaluate the source estimation performance under different noise levels. We also apply the network diffusion model with sources to the prediction of brain atrophy patterns and compare the performance with that of the network diffusion model without sources. In addition, we include a more detailed discussion about the results and the effect of the parameters.\nThe dynamics of longitudinal brain atrophy or morphology have been studied in literature [18] , [19] , [21] . Meanwhile, dementia progression has been explored in the field of data mining by various means including association rules, group lasso, highorder feature, and probabilistic event cascades [22] - [25] . Our model explicitly solves the inverse problem of inferring the source locations from brain atrophy observations. The results may help better understand the dynamics of the brain and design targeted treatments to dementia. Moreover, the inference method is also applicable to the diffusion source estimation on other types of networks as we discussed at the end of Section V.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II, the network diffusion model, input impulsive stimulation model, and the source inference problem are introduced. Then, in Section III, we present an optimization framework of the sparse source localization. Numerical simulations and the evaluation on ADNI data are performed in Sections IV and V, respectively. Finally, we discuss the results in Section VI and sum up in Section VII."}, {"section_title": "II. DIFFUSION MODEL FOR DEMENTIA PROGRESSION", "text": "In this section, we set up the network diffusion model to describe the mechanism of dementia progression and define the inference problem of the dementia sources."}, {"section_title": "A. Network Diffusion Model", "text": "We model dementia progression as a diffusion process on a hypothesized brain network G = (V, E, W ), where V and E are the node set and the edge set, correspondingly. Node v i \u2208 V represents the i-th brain region (cortical or subcortical gray matter structure) and edge (i, j) \u2208 E represents a connected region pair (v i , v j ) by white-mater fiber pathways usually. W is a symmetric weight matrix with W ij quantifying the connection strength between regions v i and v j . Connectivity among brain regions are typically selected from parcellation of brain MRI and the weight coefficients are measured by fiber tractography. We constructed the brain connectivity network based on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data.\nLet us consider the bundle of neuron fibers from an affected region v i to an unaffected region v j . The amount of disease agent transmitting from v i to v j is proportional to the product of the disease factor concentration x i and the inter-region connection strength W ij . Adversely, a reverse diffusion from v j to v i proportional to W ji x j exists. Given undirected pathways, the diffusion process could be captured by the first-order differential equation in Eq. (1) of [10] \nwhere \u03b2 \u2265 0 is a constant controlling the speed of diffusion. In [14] , a refined version of Eq.

(3) has an explicit solution\nwhich defines the evolution of the initial configuration x(0) under subsequent graph diffusion process on G."}, {"section_title": "B. Graph Filtering Interpretation", "text": "As an efficient way of processing traditional signals, the classical Fourier transform expands a continuous function x of time in terms of the complex exponentials [26] , namely\nwhere \u00b7, \u00b7 denotes inner product. We adopt x to represent the Fourier transform of x. The Fourier basis functions are eigenfunctions of the one-dimensional Laplace operator \u0394:\nAnalogously, for a signal x on the vertices of G, we can define its graph Fourier transform (GFT) x as the expansion of x in terms of the eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian [27] , [28] :\nAccordingly, the inverse graph Fourier transform is given by\nMore concisely, the GFT of x could be written as the projection of x onto the eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian in a matrix form\nwhere elements of x and x are indexed by graph Laplacian eigenvalues and vertices, respectively. When the context is clear, we could also write x(\u03bb i ) and x(i) as x i and x i accordingly. Since F F T = I, the inverse GFT is x = F x. The effect of network diffusion can also be interpreted by a filtering process of the initial configuration. According to the eigendecomposition formula L = F \u039bF T where columns of F are eigenvectors and \u039b is a diagonal matrix containing eigenvalues \u03bb i s, we rewrite Eq. (4) into x(t) = e \u2212\u03b2 \u039bt x(0) with x(t) = F T x(t), x(0) = F T x(0). The orthogonal projections x(t), x(0) onto the eigenspace of L are the GFT of x(t) and x(0), accordingly. For a given graph G with the linear diffusion process defining on it, it will transform the original signal to a signal at time step t by multiplying each frequency component of the GFT of the orginal signal with a different weight e \u2212\u03b2 \u03bb i t . Since L is positive-semidefinite, every eigenvalue \u03bb i in the diagonal of \u039b is nonnegative. When the eigenvalues are increasingly sorted, we obtained the amplitude gain of x(t) relative to x(0) at each frequency (i.e., \u03bb i ), in Fig. 1 for the 100-node random geometric network we generated in Section IV (see Fig. 3 ). The plotted curves can be understood as frequency responses of the network diffusion process after different time length t, if we regard \u03bb i as frequency of the network. It can be seen that the diffusion process acts like a low-pass filter to the initial signal for \u03b2t > 0. For fixed \u03b2, as t gets larger, the distortion of x(0) due to the shrinkage of higher frequencies will increase. This means that the recovery of the source information will become harder accordingly."}, {"section_title": "C. Input Impulsive Stimulations", "text": "It is known that dementia is not purely an spontaneous process, implying that there are certain sources driving the disease. We therefore model these sources using a series of impulsive stimulations.

An example of impulsive stimulations is shown in Fig. 2 , where each row corresponds to the sequential impulses imported to a node of a certain network.

Solving the inverse problem in a principled way could help us find the causes of the disease and maybe targeted treatments too.\nAssuming that the brain network structure is known and we observe the distribution of the disease agent (brain atrophy in experiments) at time 0 and t, we are interested in estimating the set of parameters \u03b8 = {\u03b2, c ij , t ij }. This is an inverse problem of determining the diffusion pattern based on the source information. Of course, the problem is not well defined, if we do not bound the number of unknown parameters c ij and t ij . On the other hand, from previous research it is rational to assume that the number of input impulsive stimulations is small [16] , [17] . Therefore, we further presume that during time [0, t], there are no more than K impulsive inputs at every node, namely i = 1, . . . , N and j = 1, . . . , K for c ij and t ij with N = |V|. We will introduce how to carry out the inference in the next section."}, {"section_title": "III.

Sparse Source Localization", "text": "To solve the inverse problem more robustly, we simplified the model of the input disease factor as follows. Instead of assuming that the impulsive stimulations could arrive at any time between [0, t], we restricted the arrive time on integer time steps 1, 2, . . . , K = t , meaning that t ik = k for any node i and integer k \u2208 {1, . . . , K}. This simplification is reasonable, since in practice often we only want to determine the sources up to a certain time resolution, e.g., month, year, and so on. Let y \u03b2 (t) = y(t) \u2212 e \u2212\u03b2 Lt y(0) and h ij (\u03b2) = e \u2212\u03b2 L(t\u2212t ij ) e i , then the minimization in Eq. (13) could be replaced by\nThe above procedure can be treated as a linear regression parameterized by \u03b2. When K > 1, the number of dimensions of the dependent variable y \u03b2 (t) is smaller than the number of explanatory variables c ij , which leads to many solutions to the regression. To obtain a unique and more meaningful solution, a common way is to enforce the l 1 -sparsity constraint with a sparsity-control parameter \u03b1 [29] :\nwhere\nT is a column vector storing all the amplitudes of the impulses. If \u03b2 is known, then the optimization for the sparse linear regression (a.k.a., Lasso [23] ) can be effectively solved by a few well-known methods including the coordinate descent learning and the active-set algorithm [30] , [31] . However, when \u03b2 is unknown, the overall estimation task becomes hard. Therefore, we proposed a two-stage algorithm with an initial stage and a refined stage. For the inference problem in Eq. (15), we first adopted the following iterative algorithm: Algorithm 1: Solving the Parameterized Lasso Problem.\n1. Given 0 < \u03b5 1 , \u03b5 2 , < 1.

In the end, there will be several estimates of \u03b2, namely \u03b2 1 , . . . , \u03b2 K . Thus, we average them to get a refined version (15) and apply the build-in function LASSO() in MATLAB (R2012b) to solve the problem. 5-fold cross-validation is performed for tuning the regularization parameter \u03b1 at both the initial stage and refined stage. Alternatively, Bayesian information criterion (BIC) or Akaike information criterion (AIC) [32] can also be applied to determine \u03b1. These two criteria avoid overfitting by achieving a balance between the model fit and complexity. It is worth mentioning that AIC and leave-one-out cross-validation are asymptotically equivalent [33] ."}, {"section_title": "C. Atrophy Prediction Method", "text": "With the atrophy source inference algorithm, we can also predict the changes of brain atrophy patterns. Since the distributions of atrophy sources among subjects in a same group might have similarities, potential gain of the prediction power might be obtained by incorporating the information of atrophy sources. Thus, we present the following 10-fold crossvalidation approach. First, we randomly divide the subjects in either AD or MCI group into 10 folds as equally as possible. Then, we estimate the atrophy sources for each subject using Algorithm 1 with 9 folds of the data (the rest fold was used for evaluating the prediction) and the brain connectivity network of each group. Note that the source distribution of each subject can be represented by a vector c = (c 1,1 , c 1,2 , . . . , c N ,K ) T , with N = 116, K = 24 indicating the number of ROIs and the number of months between the baseline and the 24th month. The averaged distribution of the atrophy sources was computed by averaging the source distributions of all the training subjects and is denoted by c train = {c train i,j }. After that, we predict the atrophy of the subjects in the rest fold according to Eq. (12):\nwhere x(0) denotes the brain atrophy of the baseline and x est (t) is the prediction of the atrophy at time t. By choosing every possible fold as a testing set, we can obtain the prediction of the brain atrophy of each subject at t = 6, 12, 24 months.

NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS", "text": "We evaluated the diffusion source inference algorithm by simulations on a random geometric network. To generate the network, we arbitrarily spread 100 nodes in a unit square area and drew edges between node pairs when their Euclidean distances were less than 0.2 (see Fig. 3 ). Unit weight was assigned to each edge. Then, we imported 7 impulsive stimulations c 10,0 = 1, c 46,3 = 0.6, c 90,7 = 0.6, c 51,9 = 0.2, c 30,10 = 0.6, c 70,18 = 0.3, c 20,20 = 0.7 with c ij signifying the input at node i at the j-th time step. We mark out the locations of the input sources using blue boxes.

In Fig. 3 , we visualize the observations on the network with heat maps. Warmer colors of the nodes indicate greater measurements and sizes of the nodes are proportional to the absolute values of the measurements. There are several factors which influence the accuracy of sources estimation. Here we mainly discuss the standard deviation of the Gaussian noise \u03c3 and the sparsity level regularization parameter \u03b1.\nWe changed the noise level \u03c3 from 0.03 to 0.11 with a step size 0.02. The associated estimation performances captured by ROC curves are displayed in Fig. 4 . From these ROC curves, we observe that when \u03c3 is lower, higher detection rate can be achieved with a same false alarm rate. Thus, higher accuracy of estimation can also be obtained. Here the estimation is correct if the position of impulses are all correctly estimated. Parameter \u03b1 controls the sparsity of estimation results. When \u03b1 is bigger, the weight of |c| 1 in Eq. (15) is larger, which makes the estimated sources more sparse. On the contrary, there will be more inferred sources if \u03b1 is smaller. A reasonable value of \u03b1 could be obtained by cross-validation and grid search. Here we choose \u03b1 = 0.1 for a proper tradeoff between the model fitness and the sparsity of the sources.

Typically, larger impulsive amplitudes make the signal-to-noise ratio higher and thus produce a better inference result. Meanwhile, if the distances between the input sources are larger, it is more easier to localize the sources.\nThe simulated experiments demonstrate that our method is able to determine the locations of the diffusion sources under moderate assumption of the noise level and source distributions.

To adjust for linear shifts in head position and scale within the same subject, the follow-up scan was linearly registered to its matching screening scan via 9-parameter (9P) registration, using a mutual information (MI) cost function [37] . In addition, to deal with the global discrepancies in brain scale across subjects, the mutually aligned time-series of scans was then linearly registered to the International Consortium for Brain Mapping template (ICBM-53), applying the same 9P transformation to both mutually aligned scans [36] .\nAs an image analysis tool that measures brain structural differences from the gradients of deformation fields aligning one image to another, TBM was adopted to compute the cumulative brain change in the subjects with respect to the screening scan [38] . By warping the 9P-registered and 'skull-stripped' follow-up scans to match the corresponding screening scan, individual Jacobian maps were produced to estimate 3D patterns of structural brain change over time. Color-coded maps of the Jacobian determinants were created to illustrate regions of ventricular/CSF expansion (i.e., with det J(r) > 1), or brain tissue loss/atrophy (i.e., with det J(r) < 1) over time (see leftmost column of Fig. 5(a) ).

Meanwhile, we built the averaged brain connectivity network of each subject group by estimating the connectivity probability between two ROIs with the DTI data in ADNI.\nWe reconstructed the whole-brain white matter tracts of 10 AD and 10 MCI subjects using the FMRIB Diffusion Toolbox (FSL, version 5.0; http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl). Details of the DTI data processing are described in [40] . Each voxel was selected as a seed region, and its connectivity probability to each of the rest voxels was calculated. Since the probability from voxel i to voxel j and the probability from j to i were highly correlated across the voxels for all subjects, we defined the unidirectional connectivity probability between i and j by averaging these two probabilities. The number of streamlines between every two voxels were estimated by sampling the posterior connectivity probability with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Then, we constructed a brain network of the 116 ROIs by computing the number of streamlines between every two ROIs. We visualize the mean brain networks across the subjects of the AD and the MCI group in Fig. 5(b) . In addition, to remove suspicious connections, we kept edges with larger connection weights by applying a threshold to each network. We denote the ratio of the edges remained in the thresholded networks as \u03b3, whose effect will be discussed in Section VI-B.\nWe ran our diffusion source inference algorithm for the AD and MCI groups given the atrophy measurements at time steps t = 6, 12, 24 months. For comparison purpose, we set the sparsity regularization factor \u03b1 in Eq. (15) the same in both cases. From cross-validations, we found that \u03b1 \u2208 [10 \u22123 , 10\n\u22125 ] was favorable for the two groups. In this paper, we presented the results obtained by choosing \u03b1 = 10 \u22124 .

Arrival times and locations of the impulsive stimulations of dementia were estimated via solving this optimization for every individual (the same procedure for AD and MCI groups). The resulted amplitude sequences c ij for i = 1, . . . , N and j = 1, . . . , K, were folded up and summed over each ROI to give the cumulative atrophy input c i at i-th region:\nThus, c = ( c 1 , . . . , c N ) describes the dementia source distribution of the subject. In order to obtain a meaningful summary of the atrophy sources across the group, we normalized c such that the maximum absolute value of its elements was one. The normalized source distributions for the AD and MCI groups were displayed in the first row of Fig. 6 . We also inferred the driving sources during the time intervals t \u2208 [6, 12] and t \u2208 [12, 24] by treating y(6) and y(12) as initial conditions. These results were in the second and third rows of Fig. 6 . From the plots, we observed that the envelopes of the source distributions obtained at different time steps for a certain subject group were close to each other, which might signify that the dementia was due to stimulations at a constant set of regions over the 2 year visit period.\nTo obtain an atrophy source map for every subject group, we further added up the source distributions c estimated at the three time steps. These total dementia source distributions were presented on the left panels of Fig. 7 . Two major differences between summarized source distributions of the AD and MCI groups were the lower contrast of the distribution and the denser sources in the temporal lobe for MCI. To quantify the contrast of the source distributions, we calculated the ratio \u03c1 between the sum of top 60 leading source regions and that of the rest regions. It turned out that \u03c1 AD = 8.97 compared with \u03c1 MCI = 2.70, meaning that the dementia progression was more evidently driven by a set of leading brain regions in AD than by those MCI. We also examined the difference of the distributions over brain lobes from the two groups. Using the visualization tool BrainNet Viewer [41] (www.nitrc.org/projects/bnv/), we displayed the center locations of the 60 major dementia sources inside the 3D brain mesh in Fig. 7(b)-(c) and (e)-(f)."}, {"section_title": "E. Brain Atrophy Prediction Results", "text": "To demonstrate the advantage of the proposed network diffusion model, we applied it to predict patterns of brain atrophy and compared the performance with that of the diffusion model without sources in [10] . Other than our proposed method, we implemented the brain atrophy prediction algorithm in [10] , where the authors adopted a diffusion model without sources to predict brain atrophy rate and obtained the absolute atrophy by integration.\nIn Fig. 8 , the atrophy pattern of a representative AD subject at 24 months predicted by the proposed network diffusion model is compared with both the true atrophy and the prediction result of the diffusion model without sources. From the figure, we observe that the estimated distribution of the atrophy is close to the truth and better than the estimation by the diffusion model without sources. The prediction error is probably due to the nonlinear dynamics of the brain atrophy that may not be fully captured by the linear diffusion model. In addition, we plot the estimated mean atrophy of each subject against the truth of the mean atrophy in Fig. 9 . From both the results of both the AD and NC group, we find that our model achieves better prediction accuracy compared with the diffusion model without sources. Specifically, for the AD group, the mean square errors (MSEs) of the estimation by the diffusion model with and without sources are 0.9703 and 2.4636, respectively; for the MCI group, the MSEs of the estimation by these two methods are 1.2472 and 2.4330, respectively. This indicates that our method may provide a better support for detecting and monitoring AD in an early stage."}, {"section_title": "VI. DISCUSSION", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "A. Pathological Explanation", "text": "In this section, we discuss the dominant regions that drive AD, since they could be good starting points to understand the causes of the disease. In Table I , we summarize part of the significant atrophy sources of the two subject groups (top 11 regions of the AD group and top 12 regions of the MCI group). The above regions demonstrated overlaps with the hubs of the functional brain network revealed in [41] , namely the bilateral rolandic operculum, bilateral superior temporal gyrus, right supplementary motor area, right temporal pole, right supramarginal gyrus, left medial orbital superior frontal gyrus, bilateral insula and bilateral putamen, which are primarily located at the association and subcortical areas.\nIn addition, there is a shift of dominant dementia sources from the temporal lobe and cerebellum for MCI to the central brain regions, frontal lobe and the border between parietal lobe and occipital lobe for AD. This is in line with previous findings about the dynamics of the brain atrophy in [18] , [19] . There may be multiple reasons about the different sources in the corresponded to distinct foci in the brain by studying 2332 subjects from 1-to 100-year-old. Moreover, the diffusion process is spreading on the associated brain network of each subject group. In a long term, the difference between the MCI network and the AD network increases. This also makes the sources of the two groups more distinct. In contrast, the sources of each group over different time intervals are stable as shown in Fig. 6 , since we have evaluated the atrophy data in 24 months which is a short period compared to the whole course of AD progression. Notice that the disease stages found by Braak et al. in [42] specify the spread of the disease to new regions. The sources that arise between MCI and AD stages are probably contained in these new regions. Nevertheless, some of the new regions may not be the new sources. It is also possible that some of the new sources are due to the overfitting of the model. Although we have adopted cross-validation to determine the sparsity parameter, the new sources that we have discovered are still dependent on the sparsity parameter in the model. If we increase the sparsity parameter, a few weak sources might disappear. To overcome this issue, we have picked the top 60 atrophy sources by thresholding for each subject group. Another possibility could be that the AD atrophy sources are ubiquitous instead of sparse. In this case, we believe that our model might be helpful to determine the most significant sources of the disease progression. We also find several sources in the temporal lobe, which is one of the areas that have the most prominent damage. Both left/right rolandic operculum in the AD group and left/right inferior temporal gyrus in the MCI group are involved with the temporal lobe. Note that part of the rolandic operculum is in the temporal lobe (it lies in between the parietal, frontal, and temporal lobe). However, the hippocampal/entorhinal regions are not found as strong sources. One possible reason is that the subjects we evaluated have already been diagnosed as MCI and AD. During these two late stages, some other regions might play a more significant role in driving the disease. It is possible that we will find hippocampal/entorhinal regions as significant sources if we go far enough to the early stages of AD. Moreover, it has been shown that with the progression of AD the connectivity between these regions and the other brain regions decreases [7] , [43] . This makes the hippocampal/entorhinal regions isolated and reduces the impact of these regions on the rest of the brain. Thus, the importance of hippocampal/entorhinal regions in terms of affecting AD could become less.\nIn both subject groups, we observe atrophy sources at the cingulate and cingulate gyrus (No. 33-36 in AD group and No. 36 in MCI group). Cingulate areas are abnormal in very early stages of AD. According to Huang et al., those who developed to AD had a significantly decreased regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in the left posterior cingulate cortex [44] . Significantly reduced gray matter density is also discovered in posterior cingulate areas in mild AD patients. This indicates that cingulate disorder is prominent in the early stages of AD. Thus, it is possible that cingulate areas play a leading role in the AD progression process.\nMoreover, No. 72-75 in the striatum have been inferred as possible sources of dementia in MCI group. There are evidence showing that striatum suffers more injury during AD. Braak and Braak revealed that AD patients have distinguished amyloid and neurofibrillary changes in the striatum area by sensitive silver methods [45] . Meanwhile, Simic et al. pointed out that AD patients' behavioral and psychological symptoms indicate that brain stem especially locus coeruleus might be the origin of AD [46] . This is supported by some of our discovered regions in the MCI group, namely No. 103-105 and No. 109 in cerebellar hemispheres, which have a close connection with coeruleus."}, {"section_title": "B. Parameter Effect and Future Work", "text": "In Eq. (15), \u03b1 controls the weight of |c| 1 in the minimization. Larger \u03b1 brings more entries in c to zero, and the estimated sources are more sparse. To better estimate the dementia sources, we have tried different values of \u03b1 by carrying out grid search in logarithmic scale. We find that when \u03b1 is too small (less than 10 \u22125 ), the convergence speed of Algorithm 1 is too slow; while when \u03b1 is too large (greater than 10 \u22121 ), the number of the estimated sources reduces to zero. Our results are stable when the regularization parameter \u03b1 \u2208 [10 \u22125 , 10\n\u22121 ]. For \u03b1 in this range, although the sparsity and strength of the inferred sources may vary, the top dementia sources are stable for each subject group.\nThe parameter \u03b3 represents the ratio of the edges retained in the brain networks. We have tested the algorithm by changing it from 0.05 to 1, while other conditions are kept the same. We find that different \u03b3 in this range gives very similar source distribution for each subject group. This is probably because the brain networks are dominated by a few strong connections as we can see from Fig. 5(b) .\nIn the experiments, we have used the averaged DTI networks for each subject group. Using individual brain network for each subject may further improve the accuracy of the dementia source estimation and the prediction of the brain atrophy patterns. Nevertheless, we have already achieved satisfactory prediction results in Fig. 9 . Thus, the averaged networks serve as good surrogates for the individual networks. In the future, we will test our model based on both the averaged DTI networks obtained from more subjects and individual brain networks.\nOur work provides an effective way of estimating the dementia sources and predicting the longitudinal brain changes. The diffusive model and the data fitting framework that we proposed in Eqs. (11) and (13) are applicable to the inference problem of diffusion sources on other network structures as well, for instance, disease spreading networks [47] , social networks [48] , [49] , and sensor networks [9] ."}, {"section_title": "VII. CONCLUSION", "text": "We presented a network diffusion model with impulsive sources and an efficient algorithm to solve the inverse problem of tracing back the diffusion sources. Numerical simulations demonstrated that we could estimate the locations of the sources reliably. Possible origins of Alzheimer's disease were found by using this model and longitudinal MRI scans. The average distributions of the dementia sources have different concentrations in the brain lobes for the AD patients and MCI subjects, indicating the evolution of the dementia driving mechanism. We also showed that the proposed method could effectively predict the changes of the brain atrophy patterns. Our method enables the quantitative assessment of the dementia causes, which may help discover targeted treatments of the disease."}]
