[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Objectives: Semi-quantitative image analysis methods in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) require normalization of positron emission tomography (PET) images.

The objective of this study is to calculate several HFs in different diagnostic groups and determine the group differences. Methods: All image and metadata were acquired through the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. Subjects were grouped in three ways: by clinical diagnosis, by APOE e4 allele, and by Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog) score. Several GLCM matrices were calculated for different direction and distances (1-4 mm) from multiple regions on PET images. The HFs, contrast, correlation, dissimilarity, energy, entropy, and homogeneity, were calculated from these GLCMs. Wilcoxon tests and Student t-tests were performed on Haralick features and standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) values, respectively, to determine group differences. In addition to statistical testing, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to determine the discrimination performance of the selected regional HFs and the SUVR values. Results: Preliminary results from statistical testing indicate that HFs were capable of distinguishing groups at baseline and follow-up (false discovery rate corrected p,0.05) in particular regions at much higher occurrences than SUVR (81 of 252). Conversely, we observed nearly no significant differences between all groups within ROIs at baseline or follow-up utilizing SUVR. From the ROC analysis, we found that the Energy and Entropy offered the best performance to distinguish Normal versus mild cognitive impairment and ADAS-Cog negative versus ADAS-Cog positive groups. Conclusion: These results suggest that this technique could improve subject stratification in AD drug trials and help to evaluate the disease progression and treatment effects longitudinally without the disadvantages associated with intensity normalization."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Regional and voxel-based semi-quantitative image analysis methods in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) research require normalization of positron emission tomography (PET) images before data analysis. Most amyloid-PET (A\u03b2-PET) studies in AD use cerebellum as the reference region, [1] [2] [3] [4] however, recent research has found variabilities associated with the cerebellar normalization of amyloid PET images.\nHowever, other recent studies have found impaired amyloid PET radiotracer uptake in damaged areas of WM. 9 WM injury is common in aging and dementia. [10] [11] [12] [13] Therefore, the utility of WM as a reference region may depend on its structural and functional integrity, which can vary among individual subjects.\nBased on these findings, we have identified that the amyloid PET normalization process poses a critical challenge for semi-quantitative PET studies in AD. In this work, we evaluate a different semi-quantitative PET approach that does not require the intensity normalization of A\u03b2-PET activity to a reference region activity. This method is based on Haralick features (HFs) that can be calculated from the Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrices (GLCMs) of A\u03b2-PET images to provide a statistical description of the spatial characteristics of amyloid PET. 14 The objective of this study is to determine whether higher-order texture-based features derived from the GLCMs of [ 18 F]-Florbetapir-PET images can identify statistically and clinically significant differences between subject groups without using a reference region for PET intensity normalization."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative", "text": "The data presented in this study were acquired from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu).

First-order statistics metrics from histograms evaluate only pixel intensities, while GLCM assesses their spatial associations. To generate the GLCM, pixel intensities within 2D images were first discretized. The GLCM was then calculated by tabulating the occurrences of a combination of pixel values between a reference and neighboring pixels for a particular distance and direction. We used the graycomatrix() function in MATLAB (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, Massachusetts, USA) to generate all GLCMs. The GLCM was calculated by specifying an offset or displacement vector and counting all pairs of voxels separated by this offset having intensity levels i and j. By default, the graycomatrix function in MATLAB calculates the GLCM based on the horizontal proximity of the pixels: (0 1). That is the pixel next to the pixel of interest on the same row. However, other voxel spatial relationships can be specified by using the \"Offsets\" parameter as input. This approach allows for multiple GLCMs with different directions and distances to be generated from a single image. Figure 1 highlights this process for creating representative GLCMs from a sample image. For each axial slice, 34 GLCMs were calculated for different offsets ( Figure 1A ). Then, an average GLCM (GLCM_avg) was calculated from "}, {"section_title": "2080", "text": "Campbell et al these individual GLCMs. The HFs were calculated from each GLCM_avg, and then the features were averaged over multiple axial slices.

Briefly describing the HFs, Contrast measures the local variations in the GLCM. Correlation measures the linear dependence of the pixel intensity related to its position in the image. Dissimilarity is akin to Contrast with measuring local variations, however, it has a linear dependent off-diagonal of the GLCM. Energy is associated with local homogeneity in the image. Entropy, similar to how it is defined in physics, measures the spatial disorder in the GLCM. Finally, Homogeneity measures how similar the pixel intensities of the GLCM are, and thus, is akin to a measure of uniformity. It is our hypothesis that HFs may be sensitive to changes in spatial distribution and amyloid activity among different subject groups. For this study, GLCMs were generated from the largest five axial slices through the PCC, LFL, RFL, LPL, RPL, LTL, and RTL. Before generating the GLCM, each axial slice was discretized into 128 intensity bins. For each slice, GLCMs were generated for each distance between 1 and 4 pixels at angles between 0 and 165 degrees. The average of these GLCMs was used to calculate HFs.

In the representative case shown, we observe a greater degree of clustering in the normal GLCM versus the MCI GLCM, which exhibits a larger spread along its diagonal. Comparing the GLCM of normal and MCI subjects, we observed GLCMs with more occurrences at greater discretized intensities for MCI subjects.\nResults from the Student's t-and Wilcoxon tests are displayed in Tables 2-4 and SUVRs for the precuneus and PCC shown in Figure 3 .

There was statistically significant separation in Energy and Entropy between the normal and MCI subject populations in the majority of ROIs at baseline and 24-month follow-up. Energy and Entropy also offered the largest AUC values for accurately classifying subjects with respect to their clinical diagnosis (Normal versus MCI) or ADAS-Cog status (negative versus positive).\nAn interesting consequence observed from the results is the apparent disconnect between the statistical testing and ROC diagnostic performance. Results from the Student's t-tests determined that no significant differences were exhibited in SUVR for each stratified group in all ROIs. However, ROC curve analysis verified SUVR's capability to distinguish populations, specifically in the RTL. This diagnostic capability also extended to all brain regions for the APOE Table 3 FDr-adjusted p-values of HFs and SUVR group difference (APOE-negative, APOE-positive) at baseline and follow-up Figure 4B . Recall that AUC can be interpreted as diagnosis accuracy as a percentage, where 0.5 represents 50% accuracy. Even though SUVR appears to be a sensitive metric for differentiating APOE populations, other texture features perform better with respect to the two other classification schemes. HFs are abstract mathematical models that are used in many different applications. The innovative aspect of this study was to utilize these features for characterizing abnormal A\u03b2 pathology from non-normalized florbetapir-PET images. From early post-mortem studies, 22 we know that over time the progressive A\u03b2 accumulation encompasses a greater extent of cerebral cortical laminae. The same pattern of spatial spread is observed in A\u03b2-PET images. 23 These spatial changes can affect the local disorder, homogeneity, variation, and similarity of pixel intensities, which can be captured by HFs.\nOne of the limitations of this study is the small sample size, which limits the interpretation regarding diagnostic capabilities. However, the overall objective was to compare a new image analysis method with a standard technique.
