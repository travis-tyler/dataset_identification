[{"section_title": "", "text": "on three questions: First, does wait-time for permanent residency affect an immigrant's plans to stay within U.S immediately after graduating from a U.S university? Second, what is the impact of wait-time on actual retention of these foreign born doctoral recipients? Third, is any impact of wait-time on the retention of immigrant doctoral recipients in the U.S. persistent or temporary? The SED annually surveys individuals receiving research doctoral degrees from U.S institutions in a particular calendar year. These data are used to analyze immigrant doctoral recipients' plans to stay in the U.S. immediately after graduation. The SDR surveys are biennial longitudinal data, drawn from the SED sample, that provide a seven percent sample of persons obtaining their doctoral degree in the United States. While the SED only surveys newly graduated doctoral recipients, the SDR surveys follow cohorts of doctoral graduates over time. I use 2010 and 2013 SDR surveys to estimate the impact of GC wait-time on the location decisions of immigrants receiving their Ph.D. between 2001 and 2013. The information on Green Card (GC) wait-times is available on USCIS website, and matched to immigrants using country of birth and year of graduation recorded in the SED and SDR data. The results indicate that an additional year of wait-time decreases the probability of retention of fresh immigrant doctoral recipients (0-2 years since graduation) by 5.5 percentage points. The current (Jan 2016) predicted wait-times from India and China are ten and six years respectively. This can decrease probability of retention of fresh graduates (0-2 years since graduation) from these two countries by onehalf and one-third respectively. However, the results indicate that the impact of wait-time on the retention of immigrant Ph.D. recipients is temporary and not persistent. For immigrant doctoral recipients between 3 and 5 years since graduation the impact decreases to 1.2 percentage points, and, for the immigrants at least 6 years past graduation there is no effect of wait-time on immigrant's retention in the U.S. Previous studies have analyzed the impact of visa restrictions on source and receiving countries' knowledge economies. However, there is a dearth of research analyzing the impact of these visa Note: \"The use of NSF data does not imply NSF endorsement of the research, research methods, or conclusion contained in this report.\" restrictions on the retention of immigrant doctoral recipients graduating from U.S. universities. Finn M.G (2012, 2014) studied trends in the stay-rates of doctoral recipients from U.S universities and concluded that stay-rates vary substantially by country of citizenship. This is the first study to analyze the impact of wait-time for permanent residency on the immediate and long term retention of immigrant doctoral recipients graduating within U.S."}, {"section_title": "INSTITUTIONAL BACKGROUND ON VISAS AND PERMANENT RESIDENCY", "text": "The paper evaluates the retention of immigrants who graduated with Ph.D.s from universities in the United States. In 2009, 33 percent of the doctoral degrees within U.S. were earned by foreign students. In all, these international graduate students accounted for 50 percent of degrees in the physical sciences, 67 percent in engineering and 68 percent in economics (Bound, Turner and Walsh, 2009). More than 65 percent of these foreign graduates continue to stay and work in U.S. after graduation (Borjas, 2009). As students in the United States, these immigrants are mostly on F-1 visas 1 , which allow international students to pursue education in the United States. After graduation, F-1 students who become employed in the United States may switch to H1-B visas, if they are sponsored by their employers. The H1-B visa program is designed for temporary workers employed in \"specialty occupations\". The specialty occupations require specialty knowledge and at least a bachelor's degree or its equivalent. On this visa status immigrants can work in the U.S up to three years from the date of sponsorship, and then the visa requires renewal after every three years 2 . While immigrants are on H1-B visa, they are tied to the sponsoring firm, they cannot leave their employer within U.S., and if they get 1 Except immigrants from Canada and Mexico they get F-3 visas. These are for \"border commuters\" who reside in their country of origin while attending school in the United States. These are granted to nationals of Mexico or Canada only and these visa holders may study part time -or full time. laid-off they are required to leave the country, unless they succeed in finding a new sponsoring employer. While on H1-B visa status, immigrants are eligible to adjust their status to become legal permanent residents (LPR) or Green Card (GC) holders. Once an immigrant receives GC status they are free to look for other employment opportunities and can start their own businesses and consultancies 3 . Recently graduated doctoral recipients' who do not have H1-B sponsorship from the employer have an option to remain and work within United States for one to two years on the OPT (optional practical training) status. However, they cannot file for GC on this status 4 . When these immigrants apply to become legal permanent residents, the wait-time depends on their country of birth and date of acceptance of the GC petition. If an immigrant is from any country except China and India the change of status from H1-B to GC is immediate. However, for an immigrant from China and India, because of high volumes of GC petitions from these countries in the EB-2 (highskilled) category, and limited annual per country quotas, the status change from H1-B to GC takes years 5 . For example, take two immigrants on H1-B, one from the U.K. and other from India. Assume for both immigrants the GC applications are accepted in January, 2016. There is no wait-time for the immigrant from the U.K.. Because U.K. never exceeds the quota, there is no backlog, and his visa status is changed immediately to GC. In January, 2016 however, the USCIS was only granting GC status to immigrants from India whose application had been accepted in August 2008. Because of this backlog, the immigrant from India has an estimated wait-time of 7.52 years for permanent residency. The United States Department of State publishes a monthly Visa Bulletin 6 , which lists cut-off dates for different immigration categories and countries of birth. The Jan 2016 EB-2 cutoff date for China is March 2012, for India is August 2008, and for all other countries it is Jan 2016 (current). While waiting for GC, immigrants who remain in the U.S. must remain on the temporary work visa, and are subject to its restrictions on job mobility. If immigrants' GC applications are not approved before the expiration of their temporary visa and all its legal possible extensions, they may have to leave the country (Kirkegaard, 2007). The uncertainties attached to working on H1-B may make working in the U.S. after graduation less attractive for immigrants who face longer GC wait-times."}, {"section_title": "IMPACT OF GC WAIT-TIME ON MIGRATION CHOICES OF FOREIGN DOCTORAL RECIPIENTS", "text": "Let us assume for simplicity that after graduation new doctoral recipients have three options: One, leave to home country immediately after graduation; two, stay temporarily within the U.S. and then go back to the home country; three, stay permanently in the U.S. Case I: Let us assume that the work experience accumulated within U.S. does not have any additional value in the immigrant's home country, and that the cost of returning to home country increases over time. When the doctoral immigrants compare their expected life-time earnings in the U.S. and home country respectively, they will stay in the U.S if expected life-time earnings within U.S are higher; else they will leave immediately after graduation. Now, let us add delays in GC status for some immigrants to our assumption above. These delays will compel some immigrants to work on H1-B visas for longer durations; this will further restrict 6 Visa Bulletin is a publication regarding immigration to the United States published by the United States Department of the State. The primary purpose of this bulletin is to provide an update waiting list ( also known as Priority Date) for immigrants that are subject to the quota system. Note: \"The use of NSF data does not imply NSF endorsement of the research, research methods, or conclusion contained in this report.\" employment opportunities within U.S. for the immigrants working on H1-Bs compared to other immigrants, lowering the expected life-time earnings within U.S. compared to immigrants from countries with no GC waits. This could cause immigrant doctoral graduates from countries with long GC waits to exit the U.S. immediately after graduation at higher rates. Case II: Here we assume that immigrant doctoral recipients receive positive returns to the U.S. work experience when they return to work in their home country. In this case, in order to maximize their lifetime earnings, these immigrants may choose first to accumulate U.S work experience before returning to their home country. That is, there will be some temporary stayers. Further, assuming that there are diminishing returns to accumulative U.S. experience, and the cost of transition back increases with time spent in the U.S., these temporary stayers may prefer to exit U.S. at their early to mid-career points. With perfect information and no wait-time for GC status, immigrant doctoral recipients choose their optimal stay durations in the U.S to maximize their aggregate life time earnings. However, with the long GC waittime and the limitations on H1-B visas, the optimal-stay duration of these immigrants will likely be reduced. These immigrants on temporary work visas are likely to exit the country earlier, compared to the optimal exit duration they would have if they had their GC status."}, {"section_title": "DATA", "text": "The analysis uses data from Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED) and the Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR). These data files provide detailed information on educational attainment and career outcomes of doctoral recipients graduating from U.S universities 7 . 7 The data set for these high-skilled workers is maintained by the National Science Foundations. The National Science Foundation has two websites that provide detail descriptions of the SED and SDR data sets. The SED website is http://www.nsf.gov/sbe/srs/ssed/sedmeth.htm; and the SDR website is http://sestat.nsf.gov. The data used for analysis in the paper are available from the NSF under a licensing agreement designed to guard the confidentiality of the survey participants. The SED annually surveys individuals graduating with research doctoral degrees from U.S institutions. The SED response rate is around 92 percent. This data set is a rich source of information on new doctoral recipients. The SED asks the recent doctoral graduates if they intend \"to live, work, or study in the U.S after graduation\". I use this information to analyze whether the waiting period to procure a Green Card (GC) affects intentions to stay and work within the country after graduating from U.S universities. I restrict my analysis to immigrants who received their doctoral degree between 1990 and 2010. The data includes both immigrant doctoral graduates entering U.S. as graduate students and immigrants entering U.S. as under-graduate students and then entering graduate schools for doctoral degrees. I identify \"immigrants\" in the data set to be an individual who is either a naturalized citizen or a non-citizen. To identify native country, I use information on birth country, country of high school and country where Bachelor's degree was awarded. In order to reduce miss-measurement of home country, only individuals having high school country same as birth country or country where Bachelor's was awarded is same as birth country or all three are same were included in the sample. In most cases (95percent plus), birth country of individuals matched with either country of high school or country where Bachelors degree was awarded. The SED provides information on doctoral recipients' intentions to remain in the U.S. but does not follow recipients over time. The SDR is a biennial longitudinal data of doctoral recipients drawn from the universe of respondents in SED. A sample of newly minted doctorates is added to the sample every two years and a \"maintenance cut\" of older doctorates is conducted in order to keep the sample size relatively constant at around 30,000 per wave. I restrict my analysis to immigrant graduates only. Note: \"The use of NSF data does not imply NSF endorsement of the research, research methods, or conclusion contained in this report.\" The analysis uses the 2010 and 2013 SDR waves; these waves use integrated design ensuring proper representation of PhD. graduates from U.S. universities who live outside the U.S 8 . The analysis uses the SDR 2010 and 2013 sample weights 9 . GC wait-times are calculated using the U.S. government's visa bulletins, which are available on the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) website. The Visa Bulletins publish country-specific GC cut-off dates for each month in a year. Here I present a simple example to explain the wait-time calculation for GC status. Let us assume that a hypothetical individual graduates on April 1 st 2013. I assume that it takes about a year to submit and get the GC petition accepted by USCIS. Adding this year, I expect that the USCIS will accept the application of this immigrant by April 1 st , 2014. If on April 1 st , 2014 GC cut-off date for the immigrant's country is April 1 st , 2014, that is current or later, then the expected wait-time for this hypothetical immigrant is 0. Whereas, if on April 1 st 2014 the GC cut-off date for the immigrant's country is November 1 st 2008, then the expected wait-time for this hypothetical individual is estimated as follows : ( April 1 st 2014 -November 1 st 2008) calculated in years . That is 5.46 years. Table 1 shows number of Ph.D. graduates receiving doctoral degrees in the U.S. from selected countries. The three countries accounting for most doctoral degrees are China, India and Korea. Further, 8 Traditionally SDR collected information on residing individuals with doctoral degrees. Beginning 2003, cycle the International Survey of Doctorate Recipient (ISDR) to represent U.S. trained doctorate recipients living outside U.S. was added. However there were some weighting and representation issues. From 2010 onwards National Science Foundation (NSF) developed a methodology to integrate National SDR and International SDR to assure true representation of doctoral recipients from U.S. living within or outside the country. The integrated design used in these surveys ensure coverage for all domains, thus individual migration has no negative impact on the frame of coverage. For more details see www.amstat.org/sections/SRMS/proceedings/y2012/Files/305856_75526.pdf it is clear from Table 2 that most doctoral graduates from China, India and Iran intend to stay and work in the U.S. after graduation 10 . An important thing to notice here is that China and India not only account for leading number of doctoral graduates, but these two countries also account for major proportion of graduates intending to stay and work in the U.S.. Table 1 and Table 2 together indicate that there is a large pool of doctoral candidates from China and India in the work force. This excessive supply of Chinese and Indian doctorate recipients quickly fills up the country-specific GC quota in EB-2 category. As a result immigrants from these two countries often face extensive wait-times for GC status. respectively intending to stay in the U.S. immediately after graduation. For China we observe that average wait-time in months for GC is increasing over the years and, though most recent doctoral graduates (more than 80 percent) intend to stay, there is a noticeable drop in fraction of recent doctoral graduates intending to stay in the U.S. after graduation. However, for India we don't observe any such patterns. There is no visible relationship between GC wait-time and intentions to stay and work in the U.S for doctoral graduates from India, graduating from the U.S. universities."}, {"section_title": "REGRESSION ANALYSIS", "text": "I first analyze the effect of wait-times for Green Card (GC) on intentions to stay in the U.S. immediately after graduation, using SED-DRF Files 1985 onwards. The regression specification is:  In Equation 2 In this equation \u03b2 n ' s allow the effects of GC wait-time at time of graduation to change with time since graduation. Differences in \u03b2 n ' s across the four categories reflect both time and cohort effects. For instance, it is likely that for a particular cohort, the effect of wait-time in year of graduation is different three years after graduation compared to six years after graduation. At the same time it is also possible that the impact of wait-time three years after graduation is different for cohorts who graduated in year 2004, compared to those who graduated in year 2007. Note: \"The use of NSF data does not imply NSF endorsement of the research, research methods, or conclusion contained in this report.\" Since we have two waves of the Integrated SDR data, 2010 and 2013, and additionally we have repeated observations of the same cohorts, this allows us to interact the GR nt X EW cg terms with an indicator to survey year 2013.  Equation 3is similar to Equation (2) but includes interactions of wait-time with both graduation groups and survey year indicators ( ). Our estimates of the 's will allow us to investigate whether differences in the coefficients in equation 2are due to differences in the effect of wait-time across cohorts or across years since graduation. By adding these terms we can accomplish two goals: First, we can compare effects of wait-time on the same cohort over time. That is, respondents who were in the group interval 0-2 years in survey year 2010 will move up to group interval 3-5 years in survey year 2013, and so on. This, way we can observe how the effect of wait-time varies with time since graduation for the same cohort. Second, adding graduation group and survey interaction terms will help us to observe if the effect of wait-time for a particular graduation group varies across survey years. Table 3 reports demographic characteristics by survey wave for foreign born new doctoral recipients graduating from U.S. universities using the SED data. We see that the average age at the time of graduation is around 33 years. The percentage of males graduating with Ph.D. has declined to 64.6 percent in the year 2010 from 71.1 percent in the year 2000 and 81.9 in the year 1990. The table also indicates that more than half of these recent doctoral recipients are married at the time of receiving their doctoral degrees. The average age at the time of entering doctoral program is between 29 to 33 years for these foreign born doctoral recipients. Table 4 and Table 5 13 . The table also presents summary statistics representing quality of these foreign born doctoral recipients. More than 45 percent of these graduates were funded by teaching or research or other types of assistantships as graduate students. A very small fraction had funding from government, private sector or other sources. Table 6 provides the estimation results from regression equation (1) using SED data. In column"}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": "(1) we have survey fixed effects, country fixed effects and field of study fixed effects. In column (2) we add all individual and school quality controls, and in column (3) we add the interaction of field of study and survey year. Here we observe that the expected wait-time for acquiring GC status has slight negative impact on the intentions to stay of newly graduated foreign born doctoral graduates. The coefficient on the expected wait-time here is -.011 and is statistically significant at 1% levels. The coefficient indicates that each additional year of wait-time to acquire GC status will lead to decrease in the probability of intending to stay by 1.1 percentage points. The Jan 2016 predicted wait-times for the immigrants from India and China are 10 and 6 years respectively, which is predicted to decrease the intention to stay percentage of immigrant doctoral graduates from these two countries by 11 and 6 percentage points respectively. Table 7 is similar to Table 6 but here we restrict our data to immigrants graduating in year 2001 or after. This sample is the universal set of the Integrated SDR sample that will be used to estimate the effects of wait-time on actual retention of the immigrant doctoral recipients from Table 8 onwards. We observe that the coefficient on wait-time increases in magnitude to .015. However, the coefficient is not significantly different from the same coefficient in the Table (6) 14 . Table 6 and Table 7 show the impact of wait-time on intentions to stay of recent immigrant doctoral recipients. From Table 8 onwards the analysis is focused on impact of wait-time on actual retention (continual stay) of immigrant doctoral recipients. Table 8 examines whether the effect of GC wait-time on actual retention changes with time since Ph.D. attainment. Here, column (1) and column (2) show results of regression specifications (2) and (3) respectively. Column (1) indicates that the impact of GC wait-time is greatest on immigrant doctoral recipients in group 0-2 years since graduation. An additional year of GC wait-time reduces the probability an individual who has graduated in the past two years resides within U.S by 5.5 percentage points. 15 Comparing Table 8 and Table 7, it is clear that the negative impact of GC wait-time is stronger on actual retention (5.5 percentage points) than the stay intensions (1.5 percentage points) for recent immigrant doctoral graduates. For immigrants 3-5 years since graduation an additional year of GC wait-time reduces the probability of retention by 1.2 percentage points. We do not observe any significant impact of GC waittime more than five years after graduation. This suggests that the effect of GC wait-time is short term. Wait-time causes some high skilled immigrants to exit the U.S. sooner than they would have otherwise, but GC wait-time does not affect long term retention. On the other hand, the results in Column (1) may just be cohort-specific in effects. In other words, the coefficients in Column (1) may decrease with time since graduation because earlier cohorts were less responsive to GC wait-time than the most recent cohorts of graduates. In order to determine whether the wait-time effect is short-lived, we need to distinguish between these two interpretations. In Table 8 column (2) we take advantage of two waves of longitudinal SDR 2010 and 2013 by interacting the indicator for survey year 2013 with the graduation group and GC wait-time interaction term. This way, we can test whether impact of GC wait-time on the same graduation group varies across the survey years. We also observe how the impact of wait-time varies for the same cohort as years since graduation increases. For example, immigrants of group interval 0-2 in 2010 survey will be in the group interval 3-5 in 2013 survey. The results of equation 5 are reported in Column (2) of Table (8). For the group 0-2 years since graduation there is a small increase in the effect of GC wait-time from 5.1 percentage points to 5.7 16 percentage points between the 2010 and 2013 surveys. For immigrants three or more years postgraduation there is no change in the effect of GC wait-time across the two survey years. Further, in Table 8 Column (2) the coefficient on interaction term 3-5 X E (WT) X I 2013 is not significant. This indicates that the impact of GC wait-time for those 0-2 years since graduation in 2010 is not permanent. As this cohort moves to 3-5 years since graduation in survey year 2013, the impact of GC wait-time falls substantially. Similarly, for individuals in the group 3-5 years since graduation in survey year 2010, the slight negative impact of GC wait-time on individual retention (-.009) disappears when they move up to the group 6-8 years since graduation in the survey year 2013. This confirms that this negative impact of GC wait-time on the retention of immigrant doctoral recipients is in fact temporary and it decreases and disappears with time since graduation."}, {"section_title": "IMPACT OF MARRIAGE AND EMPLOYER'S UNWILLINGNESS TO SPONSOR GREEN CARD", "text": "There are two instances that may impact the estimation of GC wait-time computed in this paper first is marriage to a U.S. citizen or a Green Card holder the second is employers' unwillingness to sponsor Green Card. We cannot observe the exact route or exact GC wait-time for Green Card in the SDR data set. However, using our estimation technique we can compute the closest approximation of the GG wait for these immigrant Ph.D. recipients. There is less chance that this measurement error in computation of wait time strongly impacts the results of this paper. The immigrant doctoral recipients on spousal Green Card (via marriage) have zero GC wait. This will considerably reduce the GC wait-time for immigrants from China and India. Assuming immigrants on spousal Green Card are more likely to stay within United States because of family bounds. There is a strong chance that ignoring these adjustments for Green Card route might underestimate the impact of GC wait-time on continual stay of immigrants from these countries. With the help of our current analysis we are at least able to capture the lower bound of the impact of GC wait-time on the continual stay for these immigrants. Employers' unwillingness to sponsor Green Card may add to the GC wait-time for all immigrants irrespective of their country of origin. However, most employees hiring such high skilled employees Note: \"The use of NSF data does not imply NSF endorsement of the research, research methods, or conclusion contained in this report.\" desire to sponsor GC to add to permanency of the employment. Moreover, immigrants prefer to work with firms with immigrant friendly procedures. There is a less chance that the sample of high skill immigrants is affected by this issue."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "The results indicate that an additional year of GC wait-time decreases the probability of retention of fresh immigrant doctoral recipients (0-2 years since graduation) by 5.5 percentage points. The current (Jan 2016) predicted GC wait-times from India and China are ten and six years respectively. This can decrease probability of retention of fresh graduates (0-2 years since graduates) from these two countries by half and one third respectively. However, the results indicate that the impact of GC wait-time on the retention of immigrant Ph.D. recipients is temporary and not persistent. For immigrant doctoral recipients between 3 and 5 years since graduation the impact decreases to 1.2 percentage points, and, for the immigrants at least 6 years past graduation there is no effect of GC wait-time on immigrant's retention in the U.S. This is the first study evaluating the impact of long waits for Green Card that immigrants from some countries face due to excess demand of residency petitions in the U.S. from their birth country, on their intentions to stay and retention within the U.S. Results of the study can be used to evaluate a bigger policy question regarding the competence of high skilled immigrant policies to ensure retention of the foreign researchers and scientists graduating from U.S. universities.
