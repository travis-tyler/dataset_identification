We hypothesize that the cumulative genomic risk for major depressive disorder may be a candidate cause for the increased conversion risk. Here, we aimed to investigate the predictive effect of the polygenic risk scores of major depressive disorder-specific genetic variants (PRS sMDD ) on the conversion from non-depressed amnestic mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease, and its underlying neurobiological mechanisms. The PRS sMDD could predict the conversion from amnestic mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease, and amnestic mild cognitive impairment patients with high risk scores showed 16.25% higher conversion rate than those with low risk. The PRS sMDD was correlated with the left hippocampal volume, which was found to mediate the predictive effect of the PRS sMDD on the conversion of amnestic mild cognitive impairment. The major depressive disorder-specific genetic variants were mapped into genes using different strategies, and then enrichment analyses and protein-protein interaction network analysis revealed that these genes were involved in developmental process and amyloid-beta binding. They showed temporal-specific expression in the hippocampus in middle and late foetal developmental periods. Cell type-specific expression analysis of these genes demonstrated significant over-representation in the pyramidal neurons and interneurons in the hippocampus. These cross-scale neurobiological analyses and functional annotations indicate that major depressive disorder-specific genetic variants may increase the conversion from amnestic mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease by modulating the early hippocampal development and amyloid-beta binding. The PRS sMDD could be used as a complementary measure to select patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment with high conversion risk to Alzheimer's disease.

Identifying biological measures with the potential to predict the conversion from aMCI to Alzheimer's disease is clinically important for early interventions of Alzheimer's disease. In the past decades, a variety of demographic (Tokuchi et al., 2014) , clinical (Mazzeo et al., 2016) , cognitive (Julayanont et al., 2014) , neuroimaging (Yuan et al., 2009) , and genetic measures (Rodriguez-Rodriguez et al., 2013; Adams et al., 2015) have been proposed as candidate measures for the prediction. Among these measures, a lifetime history of major depressive disorder (MDD) (Jorm, 2001) , the presence of depressive symptom (Kida et al., 2016; Mourao et al., 2016; Sacuiu et al., 2016; Barca et al., 2017) , or the coexistence of a diagnosis of MDD (Modrego and Ferrandez, 2004) has been found to increase the conversion risk from aMCI to Alzheimer's disease, despite of non-significant findings (Palmer et al., 2010; De Roeck et al., 2016) . However, few studies have investigated why depression could increase the conversion risk from aMCI to Alzheimer's disease.\nBesides social-psychological factors, such as stressful life events (Park et al., 2015) and interpersonal dysfunction (Hames et al., 2013) , genome-wide association studies (GWAS) reveal a role of genetic factors in MDD (Ripke et al., 2013) . In terms of genetics, one possibility for the association between MDD and the conversion of aMCI is that MDD and Alzheimer's disease may share common genetic variants. This idea is supported by candidate gene studies (Skoog et al., 2015; Ye et al., 2016) , but is not supported by the polygenic score analyses (Bulik-Sullivan et al., 2015a; Power et al., 2017) . An alternative possibility is that the MDD-and Alzheimer's disease-specific genetic variants may affect the same biological pathways, processes, cells, or structures via different mechanisms at different developmental periods. Thus, this study aimed to investigate if the cumulative MDD-specific genetic risk could predict the conversion from aMCI to Alzheimer's disease. If so, we explored the possible neurobiological mechanisms underlying the predictive effect further.\nThe cumulative genetic risk for MDD could be assessed by the polygenic risk scores (PRS) for this disorder (PRS MDD ) (Milaneschi et al., 2016) and the cumulative genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease could be evaluated by the PRS AD (Sabuncu et al., 2012) . Although many studies have used the PRS MDD to predict MDD (Holmes et al., 2012; Milaneschi et al., 2016; Gibson et al., 2017; Qiu et al., 2017) and applied the PRS AD to predict Alzheimer's disease (Escott-Price et al., 2015; Mormino et al., 2016) and the conversion from aMCI to Alzheimer's disease (RodriguezRodriguez et al., 2013; Adams et al., 2015) , no studies have used the PRS MDD to predict the conversion from aMCI to Alzheimer's disease. To exclude the possibility that the predictive effect of the PRS MDD on the conversion is driven by genetic variants common to MDD and Alzheimer's disease, we only used genetic variants specific to MDD to calculate PRS sMDD by excluding common genetic variants of the two disorders. If a significant predictive effect existed, we investigated neuroanatomical substrates underlying such a prediction. The identified genetic variants were fine-mapped into genes using different strategies, and then enrichment and protein-protein interaction network analyses were performed to identify potential functions of these genes. Temporal-and cell type-specific expression analyses were finally used to explore in which developmental periods and cell types these genes are significantly expressed.

GWAS data of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) (Sullivan, 2010) and International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP) (Lambert et al., 2013) were used as the discovery samples to calculate PRS MDD and PRS AD , respectively.

Under a certain P T , we then removed the effects of SNPs in linkage disequilibrium (LD) in each clumped region (excluding SNPs with r 2 4 0.25 within a 250-kb window) and selected the index SNPs with the most significant P-value from each clumped association region based on the discovery sample. Thus, we obtained the information of the risk alleles and effect sizes of the index SNPs for each P T value. In the target sample, the PRS was calculated for each individual as the sum of the count of risk alleles multiplied by the corresponding effect sizes (natural log of the odds ratio) across these index SNPs.\nTo identify the P T value that could generate PRS with the best prediction for the conversion from aMCI to Alzheimer's disease, the PRSice software (http://prsice.info) (Euesden et al., 2015) was used to generate 1000 PRS values for P T ranging from 0.001 to 1 with an increment of 0.001, while controlling for sex, age and educational years at baseline, the number of APOE \"4, and the first four MDS components for population stratification. P T = 1 indicates that all SNPs of the discovery sample are included to calculate the PRS in the target sample. By evaluating the predictive abilities, we could obtain the best P T values for calculating PRS MDD and PRS AD in the target sample. Using the best P T values, we could obtain the risk alleles and effect sizes of the index SNPs for calculating the PRS MDD and PRS AD in the target sample. The PRS MDD and PRS AD were computed for each aMCI patient and then z-transformed for visualization.\nTo exclude the possibility that the predictive effect of PRS MDD on the aMCI conversion is driven by genetic variants common to MDD and Alzheimer's disease, we calculated PRS specific to MDD (PRS sMDD ) only using genetic variants specific to MDD by excluding common variants of the two disorders. In the same way, we also calculated PRS specific to Alzheimer's disease (PRS sAD ). LD score regression (Bulik-Sullivan et al., 2015b) and co-localization analyses (Giambartolomei et al., 2014; Pickrell et al., 2016) were additionally performed to validate the specificity of index SNPs to MDD rather than Alzheimer's disease (Supplementary material)."}, {"section_title": "Image acquisition", "text": "Subjects were scanned with a standardized MRI protocol developed for ADNI (Jack et al., 2008) .

Using a Bayesian posterior probability of 0.90 as a cut-off threshold, there are 1582/ 1806 (87.5%) index SNPs that are highly associated with MDD ( Supplementary Fig. 1A ), but none of them are associated with Alzheimer's disease ( Supplementary Fig. 1B) , and none of these SNPs show significant colocalization between MDD and Alzheimer's disease (Supplementary Fig. 1C ).\nTo balance the number of index SNPs used to construct the PRS, we created (i) PRS tsAD , PRS AD for the top 1806 Alzheimer's disease-specific index SNPs with the same numbers of index SNPs as the PRS sMDD ; and (ii) PRS sMDD and PRS sAD under the P T = 0.009 (the same P T as the PRS MDD ). We found that the predictive effect of PRS tsAD and PRS sMDD on conversion risk of aMCI were also significant (Supplementary material and Supplementary Table 5 ).

We also found significant causal effect of the left hippocampal volume on the aMCI conversion in the Mendelian randomization-Egger regression analysis ( Egger = \u00c02.12, OR = 0.12, SE = 0.77, P = 0.002). These results confirmed a causal chain from PRS sMDD to hippocampal volume to conversion risk of aMCI."}, {"section_title": "Enrichment analyses using genes prioritized with hippocampal biological information", "text": "The 8762 SNPs used for calculating the PRS sMDD were prioritized by integrating the hippocampus-specific eQTL and epigenomic features. The weight of the prioritization and the PGC-MDD GWAS P-value of each SNP were imported into the GATES software to fine-map these SNPs into 1860 significant genes (within a 5-kb window, 5705 SNPs located inside genes, P 5 0.001).\nTo functionally annotate the 1860 genes, WebGestalt and GOrilla were applied to identify significant enrichment in GO and pathways (Fig. 3A-C and Supplementary Tables 7-9). In the annotation of GO, 505/1860 genes were enriched in the development process, 855/1860 in the protein binding, and 738/1860 in membrane part (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Table 7) . Specifically, these genes mainly over-represented in biological processes of the anatomical structure morphogenesis (q c = 4.27 \u00c2 10 \u00c05 ), cellular developmental process (q c = 7.08 \u00c2 10"}, {"section_title": "\u00c04", "text": ") and development process (q c = 1.14 \u00c2 10 \u00c03 ) ( Fig. 3B and Supplementary Table  8) , in the molecular function of the amyloid-b binding (q c = 8.64 \u00c2 10 \u00c05 ), and in the cellular components of the neuron part (q c = 3.10 \u00c2 10 \u00c011 ) and neuron projection (q c = 1.69 \u00c2 10 \u00c05 ) ( Fig. 3C and Supplementary Table 8 ).\nIn the KEGG pathway analysis, these genes were enriched in neuronal development-related axon guidance (q c = 3.95 \u00c2 10 \u00c03 ) ( Fig. 3C and Supplementary Table 8 ). These functional annotations suggest that the PRS sMDD genes were mainly related to the developmental process, and involved in the molecular binding between amyloid-b protein and its precursor, which is a well-known neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease.\nTo combine protein-level information, we mapped 1860 genes to the PPI network (642 unmatched genes were excluded). To illustrate potential functional connectivity of the remaindering 1218 genes, we used a network-based approach to identify a tightly connected PPI network (only 846 genes were included in the network). Using the network topology-based analysis, the top 10 neighbouring genes with the most functional similarity with seed genes were also included in the construction of the final PPI network consisting of 856 genes. As the most functionally neighbouring genes (Fig. 3D) , the amyloid-b precursor protein (APP) formed the protein basis of the amyloid plaques in the brain of Alzheimer's disease patients. The 856 genes in the final PPI network were enriched mainly in development processes of the nervous system, such as nervous system development (q c = 2.83 \u00c2 10 Table 10 ).\nThe prior analyses indicate that PRS sMDD fine-mapping genes are involved in brain developmental processes. We further explored in which developmental periods these genes were over-represented in the hippocampus. The CSEA online tool was used to explore the temporal-specific expression of these genes in the hippocampus. Under a pSI threshold of 0.05, 60 genes showed temporal-specific expression in the hippocampus in the middle-late foetal developmental period (q c = 6.02 \u00c2 10 \u00c04 ) (Fig. 3E) . Under the most stringent threshold (pSI = 0.001), only cell division cycle 20B (CDC20B) exhibited a temporal-specific high expression in the hippocampus in the middle-late foetal stage. The Human Brain Transcriptome dataset showed that the CDC20B was highly expressed in the early and late midfoetal development period (Fig. 3E) .\nAmong the nine major cell types in the mouse cortex and hippocampus, eight cell types exist in the hippocampal CA1 (Fig. 4A) . The PRS sMDD genes showed substantial overrepresentation mainly in the hippocampal pyramidal neurons (q c = 1.60 \u00c2 10"}, {"section_title": "Enrichment analyses using genes finemapped based on physical position", "text": "We also re-mapped 8762 MDD-specific SNPs into 1608 genes only based on the physical position of each variant (within 5-kb window).

We performed enrichment analyses for the 1608 genes and found significant enrichment in developmental process and amyloid-b binding (Supplementary material, Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Tables 9 and 10)."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "To our knowledge, this is the first study that integrates cross-scale neurobiological analyses and functional PRS sMDD genes were highly expressed in the middle-late foetal developmental period in the hippocampus.

The PRS sMDD could predict the conversion by affecting the hippocampal volume. These genes were functionally related to the hippocampal development and amyloid-b binding. In addition, these genes showed temporal-specific expression in the hippocampus in the foetal developmental period and cell type-specific expression in the hippocampal pyramidal neurons and interneurons. These findings support a model of double attacks of hippocampus to explain for the neurobiological mechanisms of the independent contributions of MDD-and Alzheimer's diseasespecific genomic variants to the conversion from aMCI to and Alzheimer's disease.\nPRS sMDD could independently predict the conversion from aMCI to Alzheimer's disease That Alzheimer's disease is a progressive polygenic disorder (Dubois et al., 2007) and no effective therapies at the late stage makes early diagnosis and treatment to be the only way to improve prognosis (Chu, 2012) . As the putative premorbid state of Alzheimer's disease (Mariani et al., 2007) , patients with aMCI have a high risk of developing into Alzheimer's disease (Palmer et al., 2008) . Because not all aMCI patients would convert to Alzheimer's disease, it is clinically important to predict the conversion from aMCI to Alzheimer's disease for early intervention. Consistent with previous studies (Rodriguez-Rodriguez et al., 2013; Adams et al., 2015) , the PRS AD was found to predict conversion. More importantly, we found that the PRS MDD could also predict the conversion of non-depressed aMCI patients. Thus, the predictive ability of the PRS MDD cannot be explained by parallel depressive symptoms (Kida et al., 2016; Mourao et al., 2016; Sacuiu et al., 2016; Barca et al., 2017) and the coexistence of MDD (Modrego and Ferrandez, 2004) . To exclude the possibility that the predictive effect of the PRS MDD is driven by genetic variants common to MDD and Alzheimer's disease, we found that the PRS sMDD could also predict the status of aMCI-C. LD score regression and co-localization analysis were performed to validate that these SNPs calculated for PRS sMDD are specific to MDD rather than Alzheimer's disease. Moreover, aMCI patients with high PRS sMDD showed 14.97% and 17.05% higher conversion rates than those with low PRS sMDD in the low and high PRS sAD groups, respectively. These findings suggest that the PRS sMDD has an independent contribution to the conversion from aMCI to Alzheimer's disease.\nIn terms of the clinical prediction for the conversion from aMCI to Alzheimer's disease, aMCI patients with the double high risk (high PRS sMDD and high PRS sAD ) showed a much higher conversion rate than those with the double low risk (low PRS sMDD and low PRS sAD ) (89.65% versus 33.33%). With the increased availability and decreasing cost of the sequencing technique, the genomic data of aMCI patients could be easily obtained, which could be used to construct the PRS sMDD and PRS sAD using the method of this study. In clinical practice, one could jointly use the PRS sMDD and PRS sAD to select aMCI patients with a much greater risk for Alzheimer's disease. Appropriate intervention procedures for these aMCI patients may prevent or delay them from progressing into Alzheimer's disease.\nHippocampal volume mediates the prediction of PRS sMDD in aMCI-C Correlation, mediation and Mendelian randomization analyses revealed that hippocampal volume mediated the predictive effect of the PRS sMDD on the conversion from aMCI to Alzheimer's disease. It has been recognized that reduced hippocampal volume is the most consistent subcortical abnormality in MDD patients in a meta-analysis of 1728 patients and 7199 controls (Schmaal et al., 2016) . The genetic variants have been proposed as an important cause for the reduced hippocampal volume in MDD. For example, MDD patients with risk alleles show a smaller hippocampal volume than those without risk alleles (Egan et al., 2003; Frodl et al., 2004 Frodl et al., , 2007 Frodl et al., , 2012 Kohli et al., 2011) . The reduction in hippocampal volume has been attributed to reduced gene expression in the hippocampus (Egan et al., 2003; Kohli et al., 2011) . In children with few life stress events, the high PRS constructed by depression-related stress system genes could predict reduced hippocampal volume (Pagliaccio et al., 2014) . Moreover, in healthy individuals without depressive episodes, the depressionrelated risk-allele carriers also displayed a reduced hippocampal volume compared with non-carriers (Frodl et al., 2008) . These findings suggest that genetic variants for MDD could result in the reduction in the hippocampal volume in different populations.\nIt is well known that the volumetric reduction in the hippocampus is the most prominent early pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease (Yang et al., 2012) and one of the most reliable predictive measures for the conversion from aMCI to Alzheimer's disease (Brueggen et al., 2015) . The additional burden to the hippocampus by MDD-specific genetic variants may exacerbate hippocampal atrophy and facilitate the conversion from aMCI to Alzheimer's disease. Thus, the model of double attacks on the hippocampus may explain the increased predictive value of the PRS sMDD on the conversion from aMCI to Alzheimer's disease.\nNeurobiological mechanisms underlying the predictive effect of PRS sMDD on aMCI-C To understand why hippocampal volume could mediate the predictive effect of the PRS sMDD on conversion, the MDDspecific genetic variants were fine-mapped into the most common genes between the two different strategies (with and without hippocampal biological information), which suggested that most genes related to these MDD-specific SNPs are associated with hippocampal biological information.\nThe GO annotation revealed that MDD-related genes were related to amyloid-b binding, which is also supported by the PPI network analysis, showing that APP was the most important neighbouring gene in the network constructed by the MDD-related genes. The increased hippocampal amyloid-B, which is an important neuropathological change in Alzheimer's disease, is also related to depression (Rapp et al., 2006) or depressive symptoms (Donovan et al., 2018) . These findings suggest that MDD-related genes may be involved in amyloid-b binding, an important neuropathological process of Alzheimer's disease.\nThe enrichment analysis of the biological process revealed that MDD-related genes were mainly involved in the nervous developmental process. The temporal-specific expression analysis further indicated that these genes were mainly expressed in the middle to late foetal periods in the hippocampus, which is in line with the critical developmental period of hippocampal neurons (Tran and Kelly, 2003) . For example, CDC20B showed the highest expression in the hippocampus in the middle-late foetal periods (Fig.  3E ). This gene is a developmental regulator of hippocampal neurons Yang et al., 2010) and plays an essential role in dendritic morphogenesis , axon growth (Yamada et al., 2013) and presynaptic differentiation (Yang et al., 2009) , all of which are associated with hippocampal volume (Stockmeier et al., 2004; Duman et al., 2016) . In addition, cell type-specific expression confirmed that these genes were mainly expressed in the hippocampal pyramidal neurons and interneurons. These findings suggest that MDD-related genes affect the hippocampal volume via modulating the gene expression of hippocampal neurons, which are the main cell types with prominent pathological impairment in Alzheimer's disease (Blazquez-Llorca et al., 2011) ."}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "Two limitations should be mentioned regarding this study. First, only volumetric measure was used as the intermediate phenotype. Consequently, we cannot exclude the possibility that other intermediate phenotypes may also mediate the association between PRS sMDD and aMCI conversion.
