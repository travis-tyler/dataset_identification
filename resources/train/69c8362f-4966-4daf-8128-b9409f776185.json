[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Onslow Beach, NC is a 12 km long barrier island that covers an area of about 5 km 2 and sits halfway between Cape Lookout and Cape Fear on the coast of North Carolina (Fig. 1). It is bordered by the New River Inlet to the southwest and Brown's Inlet to the northeast. Prior to 1932, Onslow Beach was connected to the mainland by a marshy habitat containing narrow, sinuous channels. After 1932, its connection with the mainland was altered by the construction of the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway (Cleary and Riggs 1999), which separated the island from the mainland by a 60-m channel. Onslow Beach and the surrounding lands were purchased by the Department of the Navy in 1941 for use as an East Coast amphibious training facility and are now part of the Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune (MCBCL). Although the barrier island and its shorelines are impacted by military training activities, the island is largely undeveloped and the military activities that do occur are regulated and documented in comparison to other anthropogenic impacts, such as shoreline stabilization techniques and renourishment projects on more developed neighboring barrier islands that would alter the natural state of the barrier island. The northern segment of Onslow Beach is characterized by cuspate shoreline geometry with wide beaches, a recurved accretionary beach ridge, a nearly continuous high dune ridge, and shoreline accretion rates that average 2 myear \u22121 (Cleary and Hosier 1987). In contrast, the southern segment is characterized by a narrow shoreface with abundant rock gravel on the beach, a single discontinuous scarped foredune ridge, presence of major washover terraces, and current erosion rates up to 6 myear \u22121 (Environmental Coastal Geology: Cape Lookout to Cape Fear, NC: Editor: William Cleary 1996). Since 2007, Onslow Beach has been the site of a multidisciplinary project sponsored by the Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP) to research the sustainability of military training and testing in ecologically and economically important ecosystems. SERDP launched the Defense Coastal/Estuarine Research Program (DCERP) at MCBCL with the goal of monitoring the physical, sedimentological, and biological processes as they work together to determine the state and dynamics of the Onslow Beach barrier island ecosystem (DCERP Strategic Plan; https://dcerp.rti.org/ DCERPPublicSite/PublicDocuments/tabid/76/Default.aspx). As part of this effort, hydrodynamic and atmospheric data within Onslow Bay and close to Onslow Beach were collected to help understand the underlying physics controlling natural beach erosion and accretion. It has often been assumed that tropical and extratropical cyclones along coasts create the greatest amount of change and overwash on barrier islands, especially in the Gulf of Mexico (Stone et al. 2004;Morton et al. 1995). On pristine coasts, overwash and windblown sand are the mechanisms by which barrier islands migrate, and possibly how barrier islands respond to sea-level rise (e.g., Byrnes and Gingerich 1987;Dolan and Godfrey 1973;Schwartz 1975). We were fortunate enough to collect data during a one month time period in 2008 when a tropical storm, TS Hanna, swept through Eastern North Carolina, followed by a 2.5-week period of prevailing Northeast winds that culminated in a strong Nor'easter. Tropical Storm Hanna formed August 28, 2008 and made landfall along the North Carolina/South Carolina border on the morning of September 6, 2008. Ten days later, September 16, 2008 began the start of a persistent Nor'easter that lasted until September 26, 2008. We recorded overwash events at two sites along the beach during the Nor'easter and at only one site during Tropical Storm Hanna. Available data were used to understand the hydrodynamics during both events and to validate a coupled circulation and wave model that provided important spatial information along the length of Onslow Beach."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Monitoring Data", "text": "A 1-MHz Nortek Acoustic Wave and Current Profiler (AWAC) has been deployed at 34\u00b032\u203238.40\u2033 N, 77\u00b017\u2032 47.40\u2033 W ( Fig. 1) in approximately 8 m of water and 500 m offshore since March 18, 2008 and presents a nearly Close-up of the Onslow Beach study site and AWAC location is indicated continuous 3-year record at this location. The AWAC was programmed to collect water velocity in 0.5 m vertical bins throughout the water column every 6 min. The instrument was programmed in stand-alone mode with an external battery canister that supplies power with the raw data recorded internally. The AWAC measures wave height and period using the Nortek acoustic surface tracking (AST) feature, where a short acoustic pulse is transmitted vertically toward the water surface, and the time lag between the transmitted ping and its reflections is used to generate a time series of the surface elevation. Wave direction is calculated by combining AST with orbital velocity measurements in an array near the surface. Upon retrieval, the raw data was downloaded to a PC and then run through the Nortek QuickWave Software for data quality checking and to calculate wave spectra using the maximum likelihood method. Because of the AST method of measurement, significant wave height (Hs) and mean wave period are calculated directly from the time series data. Peak and mean wave direction and period are derived from spectral analysis computed with the QuickWave software. Wave estimates for significant wave height have an accuracy of <1 % of the measured value and a resolution of 1 cm. Wave estimates for direction have an accuracy of 2\u00b0with a resolution of 0.1\u00b0. Hourly wave records from within Onslow Bay are available from NOAA's National Data Buoy Center. In particular, we downloaded and analyzed data from buoys 41035 (34\u00b028\u2032 34\u2033N, 77\u00b016\u2032 47\u2033W; Fig. 1) and 41036 (34\u00b012\u2032 22\u2033N, 76\u00b057\u2032 6\u2033W; Fig. 1). NDBC buoy 41035 is a 3 m discus buoy that has recorded wave properties, sea temperature, and meteorological conditions in half hour increments since 2005. It is located in 9.7 m of water and is approximately 8 km offshore. The quality checked data can be downloaded in text form from http://www.ndbc.noaa.gov and used in analyzing software. NDBC buoy 41036 is also a 3 m discus buoy that has recorded hourly wave properties and meteorological conditions since 2006. It is located in 30 m of water approximately 25 km offshore. At both locations, we analyzed water level, significant wave height, mean and peak wave period and direction. Water level, barometric pressure, air and water temperature, and wind direction and speed were downloaded from the Wrightsville Beach, NC NOAA tide gauge (34\u00b012.8\u2032N, 77\u00b047.2 W, Station 8658163; Fig. 1) located on the offshore side of a pier and the Beaufort, NC NOAA tide gauge (34\u00b04 3.2\u2032 N, 76\u00b040.2\u2032W, Station 8656483; Fig. 1) located at the Duke Marine Lab Dock inside the inlet. The Wrightsville Beach station was established in April, 2004 and quality assured hourly data were downloaded directly from the NOAA website (http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov). The Beaufort tide gauge has been in its present installation since June, 1990. All water level measurements have an estimated accuracy of \u00b10.02 m and a resolution of 0.001 m."}, {"section_title": "Modeling Component", "text": "Sea surface elevation and depth-averaged coastal currents are modeled using the fully nonlinear, two-dimensional, barotropic hydrodynamic model ADCIRC-2DDI. ADCIRC, developed by Luettich et al. (1992) and Westerink et al. (1994a), has a successful history of tidal and storm surge prediction in coastal waters and marginal seas (Westerink et al. 2008;Bunya et al. 2010;Dietrich et al. 2010). Water levels are obtained through solution of the Generalized Wave Continuity Equation: where: And the currents are obtained from the vertically integrated momentum equations: where H0\u03b6+h is the total water depth; \u03b6 is the deviation of the water surface from the mean; h is the bathymetric depth; U and V are depth integrated currents in the x-and ydirections, respectively; Q x 0UH and Q y 0VH are fluxes per unit width; f is the Coriolis parameter; g is the gravitational acceleration; P s is the atmospheric pressure at the surface; \u03c1 0 is the reference density of water; \u03b7 is the Newtonian equilibrium tidal potential and \u03b1 is the effective earth elasticity factor; \u03c4 s,wind and \u03c4 s,waves are surface stresses due to winds and waves, respectively; \u03c4 bx is the bottom stress; M are lateral stress gradients; D are momentum dispersion terms; and \u03c4 0 is a numerical parameter that optimizes the phase propagation properties (Atkinson et al. 2004;Kolar et al. 1994;Kolar and Gray 1990;Westerink 1994b). ADCIRC computes water levels \u03b6 and currents U and V on an unstructured, triangular mesh by applying a linear Lagrange interpolation and solving for three degrees of freedom at every mesh vertex (Blain et al. 1994(Blain et al. , 1998. ADCIRC has recently been coupled to the unstructuredmesh version of the 2D multi-spectral Simulating Waves Nearshore (SWAN) wave model (Booij et al. 1999;Dietrich et al. 2012). The SWAN wave model is based on the wave action balance equation and can simulate wave refraction, shoaling, blocking, and reflection due to bathymetry, sea surface elevations, and currents. SWAN also has the capability of using sea surface elevations and currents as input for the calculation of the wave field. It should be noted that SWAN cannot simulate wave diffraction and therefore results in regions where diffraction is significant (e.g., an obstacle) will not be accurate. It has been widely used in the coastal engineering and science community (e.g., Chen et al. 2005;Gorman and Neilson 1999;Lin et al. 2002). SWAN predicts the evolution in geographical space x ! and time t of the wave action density spectrum N x ! ; t; \u03c3; \u03b8 \u00c0 \u00c1 , with \u03c3 the relative frequency and \u03b8, the relative direction, as governed by the action balance equation (Booij et al. 1999): The terms on the left-hand side represent, respectively, the change of wave action in time, the propagation of wave action in x ! space (with r x ! the gradient operator in geographic space, c ! g the wave group velocity and U ! the ambient current vector), depth-and current-induced refraction and approximate diffraction (with propagation velocity or turning rate C \u03b8 ), and the shifting of \u03c3 due to variations in mean current and depth (with propagation velocity or shifting rate C\u03c3). The source term, S tot , represents wave growth by wind; action lost due to whitecapping, surf breaking and bottom friction; and action exchanged between spectral components in deep and shallow water due to nonlinear effects. The associated SWAN parameterizations are given by Booij et al. (1999), with all subsequent modifications as present in version 40.72, including the phase-decoupled refraction-diffraction (Holthuijsen et al. 2003), although diffraction is not enabled in the present simulations. The unstructured-mesh version of SWAN implements an analog to the four-direction Gauss-Seidel iteration technique employed in the structured version, and it maintains SWAN's unconditional stability (Zijlema 2010). SWAN computes the wave action density spectrum N x ! ; t; \u03c3; \u03b8 \u00c0 \u00c1 at the vertices of an unstructured triangular mesh, and it orders the mesh vertices so it can sweep through them and update the action density using information from neighboring vertices. It then sweeps through the mesh in opposite directions until the wave energy has propagated sufficiently through geographical space in all directions. It should be noted that, as a spectral model, SWAN does not attempt to represent physical processes at scales less than a wave length even in regions with fine-scale mesh resolution. SWAN is driven by wind vectors, water levels and currents computed at the vertices by ADCIRC. Marine winds can be input to ADCIRC in a variety of formats, and these winds are adjusted directionally to account for surface roughness (Bunya et al. 2010). ADCIRC interpolates spatially and temporally to project these winds to the computational vertices, and then it passes them to SWAN. The water levels and ambient currents are computed in ADCIRC before being passed to SWAN where they are used to calculate all related wave processes (wave propagation, depthinduced breaking, etc., Dietrich et al. 2010). ADCIRC and SWAN run in series on the same local mesh. The two models \"leap frog\" through time, each being forced with information from the other model. At the beginning of a coupling interval, ADCIRC can access the radiation stress gradients computed by SWAN at times corresponding to the beginning and end of the previous interval. ADCIRC uses that information to extrapolate the gradients at all of its time steps in the current interval. These extrapolated gradients are used to force the ADCIRC solution. Once the ADCIRC stage is finished, SWAN is run for one time step, to bring it to the same moment in time as ADCIRC. SWAN can access the wind speeds, water levels and currents computed at the mesh vertices by ADCIRC, at times corresponding to the beginning and end of the current interval. SWAN applies the mean of those values to force its solution on its time step. At the end of each of its time steps, SWAN computes the wave radiation stresses and their gradients and then passes those gradients as a forcing function to ADCIRC (Dietrich et al. 2010(Dietrich et al. , 2011a(Dietrich et al. , 2011b. For this work, ADCIRC was run for 600 s with a \u0394t of 1 s and SWAN is run for 600 s with a \u0394t of 600 s. For our work, a tidal spin-up was completed from July 20 through August 20, 2008 in order to ramp to a dynamic equilibrium prior to the start of wind and wave forcing. Thereafter, marine winds from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction's North American Mesoscale Model (NAM) also called the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model (Skamarock et al. 2005) were incorporated into the model run. These model winds are a NOAA product that provides wind forecast fields up to 84 h in the future that are data assimilated with offshore buoy data such as the NOAA NDBC buoys and are spaced at 12 km geographically and 3 hrs temporally. The NAM winds are on a Lambert conformal projection and are transformed and interpolated onto a regular latitude/longitude grid with 1/8 degree resolution outside of ADCIRC and then read into ADCIRC and interpolated onto the irregular domain using standard techniques. A coupled ADCIRC and SWAN model run from August 28 through September 24, 2008 was completed. Model output was stored at half hours intervals for subsequent analyses."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Observational Data", "text": "Tropical Storm Hanna is clearly evident in the wind record that has been rotated into oceanographic convention (Fig. 2) as wind speeds increase to over 10 ms \u22121 on the 6th of September. Following Hanna were light southwesterly winds that lasted until September 16th when persistent northeasterly winds dominated the wind record until September 25, 2008. A quick switch from northeasterly to southeasterly wind occurred just after the predominate northeaster. Significant wave heights (Hs) reached a maximum of 6 m offshore, as recorded in the NDBC 41036 buoy data, and 3 m inshore, as recorded by the AWAC, during Tropical Storm Hanna (Fig. 3), whereas they reached a maximum of 5 m offshore and 2.5 m inshore during the peak of the Northeaster (Fig. 3). The nearshore mean wave periods during the Nor'easter, a time span that covers September 16th through September 26th, were slightly more narrow banded with a central tendency of approximately 4 s as opposed to the more even distribution evident during Hanna , a time span that covers September 5th through September 8th (Fig. 4a, b). Low frequency swell waves were noted in the peak period during TS Hanna, but not evident during the Nor'easter (Fig. 4b, c). Demeaned and detided water level records at Beaufort (NOAA Bft in Fig. 1; approximately 60 km NE of the AWAC location), the AWAC location, and Wrightsville Beach (NOAA Wrvl in Fig. 1; approximately 58 km SW of the AWAC location) each documented the effects of TS Hanna, however Wrightsville Beach appeared to be more affected than the other locations which may be due to its proximity to the center of the storm (Figs. 1 and 5). The storm made landfall during the early hours of September 6th near low tide and 2-3 days before the neap phase of the spring/neap tidal cycle. The Nor'easter's peak occurred on September 26th and spanned a whole tidal cycle, after the wind had switched from blowing from the northeast to from the southeast (Figs. 2 and 3). Storm surge from TS Hanna on the order of 40 cm was recorded at the AWAC location (Fig. 6). During the Nor'easter, base water levels are initially 20-30 cm higher presumably from the persistent wind driven Eckman transport associated with persistent northeast winds. Additionally, a surge of 20-30 cm in water level is evident on September 26th after the winds had shifted from blowing from the northeast to blowing from the southeast. Following TS Hanna, the beach was surveyed as part of the overall DCERP project and overwash was evident only at a focus site approximately 2 km northward of New River Inlet along Onslow Beach whose average dune height is 2.46 m. The beach was surveyed again after the Nor'easter and overwash was present at two focus sites: the same site 2 km north of New River Inlet and another site 4 km northward of New River Inlet along Onslow Beach whose average dune height is 3.96 m. The same researchers conducted the surveys using Real Time Kinetic-GPS profile survey methods which have a three-dimensional error rate of \u00b13.0 cm, which includes a \u00b11.5 cm factory-estimated maximum instrument error and an average of \u00b11.5 cm RTK-GPS error (see Theuerkauf and Rodriguez 2012). Surveys indicated beach accretion at the site during TS Hanna and erosion during the Nor'easter (RTI 2009)."}, {"section_title": "Modeling Data", "text": "The ADCIRC and SWAN model was configured to simulate water level (ADCIRC) and significant wave heights (SWAN) from August 20th to September 27th, 2008 over the entire domain and output at specific locations within the domain for direct comparison with the monitoring data. ADCIRC did a good job of capturing tidal variability in water level at the AWAC location (Fig. 7) and the detided and demeaned water level showed similar trends at the AWAC location as well (Fig. 8). Correlations between simulated water levels and observations at the AWAC location were high (0.9011; Table 1) as well as with the NOAA tide gauge data in Wrightsville Beach (0.8565; Table 1) and Beaufort (0.8771; Table). RMS values between the ADCIRC simulation and recorded water levels were approximately 20 cm and are comparable to results found in a different study along Onslow Beach (ranges from 15.8-18.9 cm; Allard et al. 2000). SWAN simulations of significant wave height were similarly skillful. The SWAN model simulation captured the rise in significant wave heights due to TS Hanna and the Nor'easter at the AWAC location (Fig. 9) although in both cases, the predicted significant wave heights were approximately 0.5 m below the observed. This was consistent at all sites and may be a reflection of the slight underprediction of wind speeds as compared to offshore buoys (data not shown). However, there was good correlation between the available monitoring data and the SWAN model output (AWAC00.8956; NDBC 4103500.8661; NDBC 410360 0.8985; Table 1). SWAN simulations appeared to do a better job than a previous study that implored STWAVE (Allard et al. 2000). The model captured essential peaks in significant wave heights and water level in the Onslow Beach Region, and therefore the alongshore distribution of modeled significant wave heights, water level, and wave period was used to calculate the mean run-up and the extreme run-up, defined by the 2 % exceedence value (Stockdon et al. 2006), during the TS Hanna and Nor'easter time frames. The mean run-up and extreme run-up (thick lines) for each period where water levels were highest during TS Hanna and the Nor'easter was visualized and compared. A comparison of the extreme runup and the average dune heights (Fig. 10) indicate that overwash was likely on the southern end of Onslow Beach where average dune crest heights are lower and not as likely on the northern end of Onslow Beach where average dune crest heights are higher. Extreme run-up was also higher during the Nor'easter than during TS Hanna, however mean Fig. 7 Water level recorded at the AWAC location (solid line) compared with ADCIRC simulated water level (dashed line) at the same location Fig. 8 Demeaned-detided water level recorded at the AWAC location (solid line) compared with ADCIRC simulated water level (dashed line) at the same location run-ups were comparable between time periods. Compared with the dune heights, it seems plausible that the extreme runup during the peak of the Nor'easter could have overwashed the beach approximately 4 km north of the New River Inlet."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "It has generally been accepted that tropical and extratropical storms can have a large impact on sediment transport and barrier island overwash (Sallenger 2000). As defined in Donnelly et al. (2006), overwash can be of two varieties: run-up overwash and inundation overwash with subclasses in each based on extent. Within a one month period during September, 2008, Onslow Beach experienced two meteorologically significant events, one a tropical storm and the other a Nor'easter with a quick wind shift at the very end, which produced shoreline overwash at different locations. While the tropical storm generated higher significant wave heights (maximum of 3.3 m inshore), overwash was only recorded at the low lying portions of the southwestern end of the island, approximately 2 km along Onslow Beach from New River Inlet where average dune crest heights are 2.46 m. However, during the Nor'easter, significant wave heights were lower (maximum of 2.4 m) and overwash was recorded at the low lying portion, approximately 2 km along Onslow Beach from New River Inlet, but also further down the barrier island, approximately 4 km along Onslow Beach where average dune heights are 3.94 m. Following the Donnelly, et al. (2006) definitions for overwash classifications, we believe that during TS Hanna, the island experienced crest accumulation run-up overwash where R+S\u2248d c , where R is the wave run-up height, S is the storm surge height, and d c is the dune crest height. In this case, substituting Hs values for R values, Hs values were significantly high to potentially cause overwash along the island, however S was lower due to the combination of storm surge timed with the falling tides. Therefore, overwash fans occurred in locations where the dune crest heights were generally the lowest. During the Nor'easter and subsequent wind shift, the crest accumulation run-up overwash was also documented at the same site previously as well as another 2 km further along the island. In this case however, while R was lower, S was higher than during TS Hanna and also coincided with the arrival of high tide. This difference led to the overwash fan further down the island.  A breakdown of the observational data at the AWAC location confirmed our initial musings. Although these data were recorded in approximately 8 m of water, they do give an indication of the physics impacting the shallower intertidal beach region. The peak of the TS Hanna Hs occurred at the same time as an ebbing tide and the fairly significant storm surge seem to cancel each other ( Fig. 11a and b; Table 2). During the Nor'easter and wind shift, while the Hs maximum was lower, the combined effects of the storm surge and flooding tide added to total water levels comparable with the TS Hanna levels ( Fig. 11a and c; Table 2). The real reason for the overwash recorded 4 km along Onslow Beach may be due to a combination of the effects of the storms. For example, TS Hanna, with its high significant wave heights may have refined the offshore slope leading up to the intertidal beach area as well as evened out the beach profile to allow for larger wave run-up during the Nor'easter. Unfortunately, we were unable to collect the required data to verify this scenario. The coupled ADCIRC + SWAN models did a good job of simulating water level and wave characteristics and compare well with similar studies of the same area (Allard et al. 2000). Modeled ADCIRC water levels were strongly correlated with observation data with small RMS values and captured tides and storm surge events well. Modeled SWAN significant wave heights appeared to be underpredicted, but captured the peak events. This may be due the wind input to the model. As stated in the \"Methods\" section, we used NAM model winds, which are generally refined with NDBC buoy data, to drive the meteorology of the coupled models. These winds do a fine job for general meteorology, but are known to underpredict winds during strong events such as hurricanes (Forbes et al. 2010). As of now, it is not well known how the NAM model winds compare with actual winds for a lesser storm like Tropical Storm Hanna. The winds, therefore, may not be strong enough to generate the right magnitude for significant wave heights. The model also showed interesting alongshore variability in combined water level along Onslow Beach. An average difference of 20 cm was modeled between the TS Hanna peaks and the Nor'easter peaks with a trend towards higher water levels on the southern portion of the island. Along the barrier island, there were peaks of 30 cm and minimums of 10 cm between the two time periods. Dune crest heights also increase dramatically from 2 m near New River Inlet to 8 m near Brown's Inlet. Obviously, locations with higher dune heights will be less susceptible to the type of excess wave run-up that we recorded here. Interestingly, when the combined water level is broken into its component parts, a nice picture develops of the controlling factors that differed between these two events (Fig. 12). For TS Hanna, wave heights are about twice as high as water levels, at least at the peak of the storm where as during the Nor'easter, wave heights were about one and a half times as high as water levels, but water levels were about 50 cm higher during the Nor'easter than during TS Hanna. Variability in the alongshore distribution of wave heights may be due to the fairly fixed offshore bathymetry (limestone ridges offshore, J. McNinch, personal communication) and the direction of the waves approaching the shore."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "While not on the order of the April 1962 Ash Wednesday storm that created large overwash sections on barrier islands along the east coast of the United States, our study is a good example of how lesser extratropical and tropical storms affect barrier islands. The analysis of the available data shows the importance of timing and the underlying low frequency variability in the system to affect barrier island morphodynamics. Specifically, (1) the timing of the arrival of high significant wave heights and surge, in comparison to the tide stage can dramatically influence the occurrence of overwash events; (2) low frequency variability in water level, due to meteorological drivers, also plays an important role in overwash occurrence; and (3) the underlying geology of the island creates a feed-back loop that influences the hydrodynamics of the area and therefore overwash possibilities."}]
