[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Seismic waves produced by the M w 7.9 Denali, Alaska, earthquake of 3 November 2002, initiated a series of water waves that damaged at least 20 houseboats along the shores of Lake Union and Portage Bay in Seattle, Washington, at an epicentral distance of 2400 km (Table 1; Barberopoulou et al., 2004). Observers reported a series of waves, or runup of water on the shore on a calm day, at the approximate arrival time of the surface waves from the Denali earthquake. The houseboats are routinely subjected to waves from large ships and windstorms, so the damage during the earthquake suggests water waves with unusual amplitudes or periods. In Table 2 we summarize water-wave observations in Washington state during several large distant and local earthquakes to show that seiching is a recurrent phenomenon in Washington. Seiche is a common term used to describe the standing oscillations setup in a lake or harbor due to a perturbation of the water level (Russell and Macmillan, 1952). Seismically induced seiches fall into two categories: (1) free seiches initiated by displacement of water due to fault motion or landslides (Russell and Macmillan, 1952;Ichinose et al., 2000); and (2) forced seiches caused by the passing of seismic waves. The latter category, which we focus on in this article, can initiate oscillations either through the tilting of the water body or from the horizontal motion of the sides (Kvale, 1953;Russell and Macmillan, 1952;Donn, 1964;McGarr, 1965;McGarr and Vorhis, 1968;Barberopoulou et al., 2004;Cassidy and Rogers, 2005). McGarr (1965) argues that for small bodies of water the angle of tilt is so slight that horizontal motions of the sides of the water body are a much more effective wave generator. The unusual water waves observed in the Puget Lowland of Washington state following the Denali earthquake were apparently initiated by large seismic surface waves directed preferentially along the west coast of North America by the earthquake source mechanism (Eberhart-Phillips et al., 2003;Barberopoulou et al., 2004;Cassidy and Rogers, 2005). The concentration of water wave reports above the Seattle sedimentary basin (Barberopoulou et al., 2004), suggests that local amplification of seismic waves by the basin may have played a role. Unusual water waves in Washington state have coincided temporally with seismic-wave arrivals from past regional and distant earthquakes. Unlike previous earthquakes known for generating seiches (e.g., the 1964 Alaska earthquake), the Denali earthquake was well recorded on a variety of seismometers worldwide and has provided an opportunity to examine ground motions that initiate seiches in water bodies at large distances. Although documented damage from seiches during past seismic events has been minor in Washington state the question remains whether amplified longperiod waves by sedimentary basins could cause highamplitude water waves during large earthquakes on local crustal faults or on the Cascadia subduction zone. Examples   A 6-10 foot upheaval was observed in the center of Lake Chelan. Waves rolled toward the shore but no wind was blowing at the time (Dow, 1964). 18 April 1906 (San Francisco, California, earthquake) \"Lake Washington Feels The Shock\" Surface of water on west side violently agitated. \u2022 Floats tossed about. \u2022 Three distinct tidal waves reported to have come from northeast. Seattle got a seismic disturbance, too, though it was quite short and luckily did hardly a dollar's worth of damage. About 6 o'clock yesterday morning Lake Washington on the west shore was agitated so violently that house boats, floats and bathhouses were jammed and tossed about like leaves on the water. Beyond breaking a few moorings and causing a small-sized fright, no damage (Seattle Post-Intelligencer, 19 April 1906). A man, who was on the bank of the Wishkah River early in the morning, said that waves five feet high rolled up the river from the sea, and that he was sure that there was some disturbance (Seattle Post-Intelligencer, 25 April 1906 of such damage to docks and ships, coastal inundation, erosion of coastal areas, damage to floating bridges, or triggering of landslides on eroding bluffs has occurred in past earthquakes in other areas (e.g., Korgen, 1995;Ruscher, 1999). The 1959 M 7.1 Hebgen Lake, Montana, earthquake was responsible for damage to the Hebgen dam when a seiche caused water to overtop the dam several times. The 2003, M 8.3 Tokachi-oki earthquake in Japan caused sloshing in oil and naphtha tanks, resulting in sparks that started a fire that burned for several days (Koketsu et al., 2005). Seismic waves from the Denali earthquake recorded on the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network (PNSN; Fig. 1) show substantially larger amplitudes and longer durations within the Seattle basin (Fig. 2) (Barberopoulou et al., 2004) than at surrounding sites. We use spectral ratios of these recordings ( Fig. 2) to examine the amplification of the shear and surface waves from the Denali earthquake caused by the Seattle basin and the shallow glacial deposits inside and outside the basin. To estimate the influence of these amplified seismic waves on the overlying water bodies we model the generation of water waves by the amplified ground motions from the Denali earthquake using a simple 1D model (Lamb, 1932;Russell and Macmillan, 1952;Proudman, 1953;McGarr, 1965;Wilson, 1972). Although simple, the model successfully reproduces the character of waves observed in swimming pools during the Denali event but probably underestimates the observed water motions in Seattle-area natural waterways. We also discuss the apparent absence of seiche reports during the Nisqually earthquake. We use the 2001 M W 6.8 Nisqually earthquake ground motions to drive the model because the Nisqually-type events are the region's most common type of damaging earthquakes."}, {"section_title": "Puget Lowland Geology", "text": "The Puget Lowland of Washington state is part of the Puget-Willamette forearc basin above the subducting Juan de Fuca oceanic plate (Crosson and Owens, 1987;Galster and Laprade;1991). The Seattle basin is one of three large sedimentary basins beneath the Puget Lowland, the others being the Everett and Tacoma basins ( Fig. 1) (Johnson et al., 1994(Johnson et al., , 1996Pratt et al., 1997;Brocher et al., 2001). The Seattle basin is a 30 km by 60 km depression in the Eocene volcanic basement rocks, filled with up to 9 km of lowdensity, low-velocity sedimentary rocks and unconsolidated sediments (Johnson et al., 1994;Pratt et al., 1997;ten Brink et al., 2000;Brocher et. al., 2001). The south end of the Seattle basin is formed by the Seattle Fault zone, an easttrending reverse or thrust fault separating thick sediments to the north from shallow bedrock and thin sediments to the south (Johnson et al., 1994;Pratt et al., 1997;ten Brink et al., 2000, Brocher et al., 2004. The Seattle Basin is bounded on the west by the Olympic Mountains, but its eastern boundary is not well constrained. To the north the basin sediments thin onto the antiformal Kingston Arch (Johnson et al., 1994;Pratt et al., 1997;ten Brink et al., 2000). The Figure 1. Map showing the strong-motion stations of the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network (PNSN) that were operating during the Denali earthquake. Stations GNW and ERW (top and left of figure) are the bedrock sites we used as reference stations for the spectral ratios. Contours show the outlines of the deep sedimentary basins and the dash-dotted contour the approximate edges of the Quaternary glacial deposits that underlie the Puget Lowland (Booth, 1994). Everett and Tacoma basins to the north and south are less well known but also appear to be fault-bounded basins of comparable size and age to the Seattle basin (Van Wagoner et al., 2002;Johnson et al., 1996Johnson et al., , 2004Snelson et al., 2000;C. M. Snelson et al., unpublished manuscript, 2006). The upper portions of the sedimentary basins are Quaternary glacial deposits that also extend across the Puget Lowland outside of the basins (Fig. 1) (Booth, 1994;Jones, 1996). These glacial deposits were laid down during a series of Quaternary ice-sheet advances and retreats, the most recent retreat being 14,000 to 12,000 years ago (Thorson, 1980). The glacial strata consist of advance deposits that were compacted when overridden by the ice and uncompacted recessional deposits that have never been covered by glaciers. The deep valleys (Puget Sound, Lake Washington) were carved by subglacial meltwater (Booth, 1994). Sedimentary basins in the Puget Lowland are docu-mented to amplify seismic waves at periods of 0.14 to 10 sec (Frankel and Stephenson, 2000;Frankel et al., 2002;Pratt et al., 2003;Pratt and Brocher, 2006). Impedance contrasts and resonance within the basin sediments explain, in part, the observed amplification, but locally generated basin surface waves likely play an important role in the long durations of ground motion. Pratt et al. (2003) measured the amplification across the Seattle basin relative to bedrock sites in the Olympic mountains, concluding that the maximum spectral amplification is about 16 at a frequency of about 0.33 Hz (3-sec period). They could not separate the effects of the deep basin from those of the shallow deposits because of their limited distribution of seismographs. It has been suggested that basin subsidence results in the concentration of water bodies over the sedimentary basins of the Puget Lowland ( Fig. 1) (Pratt et al., 1997). The Tacoma basin underlies the many broad arms of southern Puget Sound. The Seattle basin underlies sections of Hood Canal, Puget Sound, Lake Washington, and Lake Sammamish. The Everett basin underlies Puget Sound where it widens near the Strait of Juan de Fuca. This concentration of water bodies over basins that amplify long-period seismic waves could explain the many observations of water waves during large earthquakes as noted by McGarr and Vorhis (1968)."}, {"section_title": "Amplification of Seismic Waves from the Denali,", "text": "Alaska, Earthquake by the Deep Seattle Basin Strata and Shallow Glacial Deposits"}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "To measure the effects of local geology on the amplitudes of the seismic waves, we calculated spectral ratios (SR) of the Denali shear and surface waves recorded at nonbedrock sites, relative to shear and surface waves recorded at bedrock sites ERW and GNW. Data consisted of threecomponent recordings from 46 PNSN strong-motion stations distributed around the Puget Lowland, both inside and outside the Seattle sedimentary basin (Fig. 1). The data analyzed in this article were recorded by force-balance accelerometers with flat response to acceleration for the frequency range 0-50 Hz (K2 and Guralp instruments). PNSN broadband stations also recorded arrivals from the Denali earthquake, but nearly all these instruments (many colocated with a strong-motion instrument) clipped during the surface-wave arrivals and were therefore not useful. The strong-motion instrument recordings showed an emergent but clear S-wave arrival, but dispersed surface waves were by far the largest waves ( Fig. 2). Basin sites consistently had the greatest amplitudes and longest duration (300 sec; Fig. 2). Largeamplitude surface waves radiating to the southeast from the epicenter resulted in long-period effects across a wide region of Canada and the United States, similar to those from the 1964 Good Friday, Alaska, earthquake (Cassidy and Rogers, 2005;Eberhart-Phillips et al., 2003;Barberopoulou et al., Figure 2. Seismograms from bedrock and basin sites, with traces scaled to equalize their maximum values (acceleration units are m/sec 2 ). The traces show the east-west component of motion recorded at stations SEA (Seattle basin), SMNR (nonbasin) and SP2 (Seattle basin). Note the extremely large surface-wave amplitudes. The maximum acceleration was about 5 cm/sec 2 , and the maximum displacement was about 20 cm (40 cm peak-to-peak). On the right are acceleration spectra of these traces showing the dominant frequency in the signal to be at about 0.08 to 0.1 Hz (10-to 12.5-sec periods).  Figure 2 and reference sites ERW and GNW. The signal-to-noise ratio is above 2 for the frequency range of 0.01-0.8 Hz at most of the sites except at rock sites, where the signalto-noise ratio approaches 2 at about 0.3 Hz. Thus, spectral ratios taken with respect to the average of the two rock sites are reliable to frequencies up to 0.3 Hz. Between 0.3 and 0.8 Hz the spectral ratios are contaminated by noise in the rock signals, indicating that the computed amplifications will be underestimated because noise will make the rock reference signals artificially large. 2004). Maximum acceleration on strong-motion records was 5 cm/sec 2 (0.004g) at basin sites and 1.5 cm/sec 2 at bedrock sites. The recorded waves provide a frequency spectrum for analysis of 0.01-0.5 Hz (2-to 100-sec period), with the largest amplitudes being at frequencies of 0.08-0.1 Hz (10 to 12.5-sec periods; Fig. 2). To avoid results that are unduly influenced by a single reference station, our spectral ratios are computed relative to the average of the spectra from two bedrock sites. Reference site GNW is located on Green Mountain near Bremerton on intrusive bedrock (Eocene mafic igneous rock) and ERW is on Fidalgo Island near Anacortes on volcanic basement rock (Mesozoic intrusive rocks and associated metamorphosed strata). Relative to a time window before the P-wave arrivals, the signal-to-noise ratio for both shear and surface waves at the two bedrock reference sites (ERW and GNW), which show some of the lowest signal strengths, is greater than 2 at frequencies between 0.01 and 0.3 Hz (3.33-to 100-sec periods; Fig. 3). The signal-to-noise ratio at other sites, which generally have larger amplitudes than the reference sites, exceeds 2 up to frequencies of about 0.8 Hz (1.25 sec periods; Fig. 3). Thus, the spectral ratios we derive are reliable between 0.01 and 0.3 Hz (3.33-to 100-sec periods). Between 0.3 and 0.8 Hz, noise at the reference sites likely will cause the spectral ratios to underestimate the amplification factors."}, {"section_title": "Processing", "text": "The spectral ratios we computed include the effects of the source parameters, wave path, station location, and instrument response (e.g., Hartzell, 1992). For teleseisms, the source and path effects can be considered the same for nearby sites because the differences in radiation angle and path are minor (azimuthal angles for the Denali earthquake ranged between east-southeast (127\u040a) and east-southeast (130\u040a) degrees). The SR technique assumes that the hardrock site does not materially affect the amplitude spectrum of the waves, and the frequency spectra at the rock sites are therefore characteristic of the input source spectrum. Under these assumptions, the SR technique gives the amplification factor at the site of interest. We chose a 70-sec time window to compute the spectra of the shear-wave arrivals, with the window length being limited by the arrival of the surface waves. A 300-sec window starting at the Love wave arrivals was used for surfacewave analysis; this time window covered the largest-amplitude arrivals (Fig. 2). Data were tapered with a 5% Hanning taper before computing the spectra. Both horizontal components of the seismograms (vector sum of the spectra) were used in the calculation of the spectral ratios. The spectral ratios were smoothed with a three-point mean smoothing algorithm. Because we have recordings from stations on both deep-basin (20 sites) and shallow glacial deposits (15 sites), we have the opportunity, unlike previous studies, to characterize the seismic-wave amplification in these two settings. We divided the sites into three categories to differentiate the amplification effects caused by the shallow and deep sediments: (1) sites over the basins (more than 2 km of strata), (2) sites on glacial deposits and older sediments outside of the deep basin (less than 2 km of sedimentary strata), and (3) sites where bedrock is very near the surface (estimated to be \u03fd20 m based on proximity to bedrock outcrops). We classified our sites as \"deep-basin\" if they lie over the deep portions of the basins defined by the contours in Figure 1. All our deep-basin seismograph sites lie on the Seattle basin. Seismographs at non-basin sedimentary sites lie on glacial deposits and Tertiary sedimentary rocks outside of our deep-basin contours, meaning the total thickness of sediment with a P-wave velocity less than 3.5 km/sec is about 2 km or less based on tomography and gravity measurements (Van Wagoner et al. 2002). We used the 3.5 km/ sec contour as representing strong, consolidated sedimentary rocks lying near crystalline basement. Bedrock sites are known to lie on only a thin (\u03fd20 m) cover of till or sediment above metamorphic or volcanic rock."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "The most obvious result evident from our spectral ratios is the large amplification of seismic waves above about 0.04 Hz at all nonbedrock sites (Figs. 4a, b and 5). In contrast, sites on shallow bedrock other than bedrock reference sites ERW and GNW show little or no amplification except above 0.4-0.5 Hz, where noise levels are starting to be a factor (Fig. 4c). All sites on glacial deposits, both within and outside the deep basins, show strong amplification (5 or more) of both shear-and surface-wave arrivals above 0.1 Hz relative to our bedrock reference sites. The peak amplification occurs at 0.2-0.7 Hz, where amplification values often reach 10 or more. Lack of station coverage does not permit a thorough study of Everett or Tacoma basin effects, but surface-wave amplification reached 10 at the few sites near the Everett basin (Figs. 1 and 4a, b). Although rock site spectral ratios are clearly distinguished from those at sedimentary sites, the distinction between the deep-basin sites and the nonbasin sedimentary sites is more subtle. All the sites on glacial deposits show little amplification below 0.04 Hz (25-sec period and greater), but between 0.04 Hz and 1 Hz the sedimentary strata substantially amplify seismic waves compared with bedrock. The influence of the deep-basin sediments is seen on the basin spectral ratios (Fig. 4a) as a distinct amplification at and below 0.1 Hz that is missing from the nonbasin sedimentary sites (Fig. 4b). Graphs of the average amplifications for the three classes of sites (Fig. 6) show that between 0.04 and 0.2 Hz the deep-basin sites have about twice the amplification as the other sedimentary sites. These results indicate that the relatively shallow (\u03fd2 km) glacial deposits cause most of the observed amplification above 0.2 Hz, and the deep-basin strata increase the amplification in the 0.04to 0.2-Hz range. The amplifications we document are in agreement with previous studies of amplification by the Seattle basin (Pratt et al., 2003), which also show peak shear-wave amplifications in excess of 10 at frequencies of 0.3-0.5 Hz (2-to 3.33sec period). Pratt et al. (2003) noted that the largest amplifications were over the east side of the basin. Our results are consistent with this observation (Figs. 2, 5), but we have few permanent stations on the west side of the basin to rigorously test this hypothesis (Fig. 1). Potential explanations for the seismic-wave amplification can be found in Pratt et al. (2003) and include resonance, focusing, surface waves, and the low impedance of the basin sediments. The spectral ratios we present here also are consistent with inferences about basin amplification noted elsewhere (e.g., Joyner, 2000). For high frequencies (\u03fe1 Hz), in general, it is assumed that the effects of the shallow strata dominate the site response, thus causing sites on glacial deposits outside of the deep basins to show amplification. Both the shallow-and deep-basin strata influence the site response at low frequencies through long-period resonance, focusing, and surface waves (e.g., Joyner, 2000;Pratt et al., 2003). The large concentration of water-wave observations in the Puget Lowland on top of the basins suggests that the water bodies are especially susceptible to ground motions in the 0.04-to 0.2-Hz frequency range. The maximum ampli- tudes of the Denali arrivals occurred in this frequency range (Fig. 2b). The Puget Lowland may be especially susceptible to seiches during large earthquakes because of the lowfrequency seismic-wave amplification by sedimentary basins and other sedimentary structures, plus a concentration of water bodies above the basins."}, {"section_title": "Seismically Induced Water Waves", "text": "Observations from the Denali Earthquake Long-period seismic waves from the Denali earthquake initiated large waves in water bodies in western Canada (Cassidy and Rogers, 2005) and the United States (Table 1; reports to the PNSN and National Earthquake Information Center for the Pacific Northwest). Water was reported to have surged 1.5 m (5 feet) on the shoreline at Lake Wenatchee in the Cascade Mountains. Broken ice and logs were carried and washed over the shores of several lakes in Washington state. Standing oscillations (seiches) or a series of large waves were set up in other water bodies where floating walkways started moving and boats were slammed against docks. Some of the most prominent water waves triggered by the Denali earthquake were in Lake Union, in Seattle, Wash- ington, and in an arm of Lake Union named Portage Bay (Table 1) (Barberopoulou et al., 2004). Lake Union is a shallow, Y-shaped lake with the main body having dimensions of about 2 km by 1 km and maximum depths in the different arms varying between 6 and 14 m. More than 20 houseboats on these water bodies sustained minor damage consisting of buckled moorings and broken sewer and water lines. The damage reports were concentrated on the east and west shores of Lake Union and Portage Bay (Barberopoulou et al., 2004). Although this damage pattern might imply waterwave motion in a specific direction, the pattern may also reflect the greater concentration of houseboats along the east and west shores of the lake. Water waves were reported on Lake Washington, which also overlies the Seattle basin, but because of the lack of houseboats on the shores of Lake Washington there were fewer observations of damage there than around Lake Union. Sloshing action was also reported in swimming pools and ponds around Seattle (Table 1). Residential swimming pools overflowed or showed large water oscillations in the north-south direction, which is approximately the direction from which the seismic waves arrived and may indicate the effect of Rayleigh waves (Table 1). Many of the pools with reported oscillations in Seattle are public facilities or private clubs with pool lengths of 17-25 m. A typical residential swimming pool where sloshing was observed was 11 m (36 feet) long and 5.5 m (18 feet) wide with an average depth of 2 m. The distribution of these water-wave reports is obviously biased by population density and demographic factors, but the density of reports shows a close correspondence with the largest ground motions recorded on PNSN seismographs. In particular, from the 49 reports collected for Washington state 41 fall within the latitude and longitude limits of Figure  1. All the observations in the Seattle basin (thirty in total) were clustered over the deepest, central part of the basin despite large areas of dense population outside of the boundary of the Seattle basin near a variety of water bodies for which reports are lacking. Based on this correlation we believe that basin amplification was an important factor contributing to damaging water waves over the Seattle basin (Fig. 6). McGarr and Vorhis (1968) suggested that seiches from distant earthquakes most commonly occur in areas where the seismic waves with periods of 5-15 sec are amplified by local geologic structures such as sedimentary basins. As noted earlier, our comparison of spectral ratios in- Figure 4. (continued). (c) Rock and nearly rock sites. Plots of spectral ratios corresponding to stations situated at bedrock or nearly bedrock sites. Missing shear-wave spectral ratios correspond to stations with very high signal-to-noise ratio or malfunctioning instrument with no signal recorded. ERW and GNW are the reference sites used. side and outside the basins (Fig. 6) suggest that seismic waves in the frequency range of 0.04 to 0.2 Hz caused the most prominent water waves to be concentrated over the deep sedimantary basins. Large water waves from past regional or distant earthquakes have been reported in local newspapers in Seattle (Table 2), and Lake Union, in particular, has experienced many seismically induced water waves in the past. Newspaper accounts show that large-amplitude water waves occurred in various water bodies across Washington state during the 1891 Port Townsend earthquake (The Oregonian, 29 November 1891), the 1899 Yakutat Bay Alaska earthquake (Dow, 1964) With one exception, we have no water-level recordings of seismically induced water waves in Washington state from the Denali earthquake, or from any previous earthquakes, that are suitable to analyze wave motions in detail. Water levels are generally sampled only once every few minutes, or less frequently, to measure tide or reservoir levels. The gauges are often damped to filter out the short-period waves caused by wind and boats. Although longperiod seiches in bodies of water with fundamental periods of hours are adequately sampled, short-period seiches induced by seismic waves are not. Therefore, our analysis is almost entirely limited to testing whether modeling results match the approximate wave heights reported by eyewitness accounts. National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) tide gauge stations in Puget Sound provide some scant evidence of water waves caused by the Denali earthquake. The highest data rate recorded by these stations is 6-min sample intervals and each water-level datum is averaged over 3 min, centered on the reporting time. As expected, the averaged water-level data do not show a clear record of seismically induced seiches. However, NOAA also computes root-mean-square (rms) wave heights that are sampled every 1 sec but averaged in the same way as the water level. Several Alaska tide gauges show rms peaks resulting from seismic waves from the Denali earthquake, and in Washington, a tide gauge in Tacoma shows a particularly prominent rms peak at the expected time (Fig. 7a, c). A theoretical rms was computed to test whether the Tacoma rms wave-height recording was indeed a record of a seiche due to ground shaking from long-period seismic waves. We computed the rms we would expect at the Tacoma tide gauge from the Denali earthquake assuming that the seiche amplitude time-history is a scaled version of the accelerogram recorded at a station near Tacoma (seismic The computations are done for horizontal \"transverse\" motion (motion perpendicular to a line between the epicenter and the Puget lowland). Dot size is proportional to the spectral ratio (SiteSpectrum/RockSpectrum) at each period. The rock spectrum is the average of two rock sites (ERW, GNW). Stations enclosed by the heavy contours are defined as basin sites. Area is the same as Figure 1. trace at the top of Figure 7). We computed the resulting rms wave height versus time using the same algorithm as is used at the NOAA tide gauges. If we constrain the maximum values of the observed and computed rms amplitudes to be equal, we obtain an excellent match for the duration of the observed and computed rms time histories (Fig. 7a). From the computed rms amplitude, we conclude that the maximum amplitude of the waves at the Tacoma tide gauge was about 26 cm (0-peak) which is of the same order as amplitudes anecdotally reported from other bodies of water in the Puget Lowland (Table 1). The rms wave-height peaks at other tide gauges in the Puget Sound region were not nearly as prominent as at Tacoma. We believe this is because the Tacoma gauge is located in a ship channel about 140 m wide that is bounded by vertical walls. It is therefore likely that any seismically generated waves observed at the gauge would be locally gen-erated within the channel, rather than waves that had propagated across Tacoma port/Commencement Bay. The amplitudes of such waves within the channel must vary greatly with location, especially relative to distance from the sidewalls (e.g., cross-channel slosh modes). Hence it would be difficult to extrapolate the interpretation of seiche measurements at the gauge to other locations in the Port of Tacoma (Commencement Bay). The tide gauge station in Seattle would be the obvious choice to analyze in a similar fashion, but the instrument is located at the Ferry terminal on a busy waterfront and the data are therefore contaminated by highfrequency noise due to waves from ship traffic (Fig. 7c). With the exception of the Tacoma tide-gauge record, we can only compare our theoretical results with observers' reports. Most observers estimated that water-wave action in the Seattle area lasted 1 to 5 minutes, which corresponds well with the approximately 300-sec duration of the largest Figure 6. Average of spectral ratios (see Fig. 4) of basin, nonbasin, and rock sites with respect to two reference stations (GNW, ERW). (a) Surface waves. (b) Shear waves. Nonbasin sites show significant amplification because they also overlie sediments, although not as thick as the basin sediments. The thin black line represents the ratio of basin to nonbasin spectral ratios. The difference between the basin and nonbasin curves is most pronounced for surface waves at frequencies of 0.04-0.2 Hz. surface waves recorded by the PNSN seismographs (Table  1). Some observers reported wave periods of 5-20 sec (Table  1), in general agreement with the 10-12-sec period of the largest surface waves. A few reports contained a rough estimate of the number of cycles (8-10), but these estimates must reflect just the largest wave motions because the observed duration of motion was reported to be considerably longer than 80-100 sec. Many observers reported water moving back and forth horizontally with little vertical motion. Reported vertical amplitudes, observed primarily at swimming pools where the waves overtopped the sides of the pools, were typically 30 cm. On large bodies of water people reported horizontal runup of 0.6-3 m on the shore, with most observers reporting about 1 m. Water Wave Modeling Lamb (1932) developed the shallow-water approximation for standing water waves in basins of rectangular cross section (uniform depth) and variable depth. The earliest studies of earthquake-induced seiches may be attributed to Kvale (1953) and Proudman (1953). A basic mechanism for the generation of seismically induced water waves by the horizontal motion of the sides of the water body has been presented by McGarr (1965). McGarr and Vorhis (1968), and Ruscher (1999) have also studied seismically induced seiches. However, the fluid mechanics literature contains analyses of the sloshing of fluids in rectangular tanks, in particular, as applied to tanks in ships (e.g., Waterhouse, 1994;Faltinsen et al., 2000;Hill, 2003). The application of these latter methods to lakes of arbitrary shapes with variable sides has not been tested. Wind-and tsunami-induced seiches in lakes and open bodies of water have been better studied, with recent work carried out by Ichinose et al. (2000), Zacharias (2000), and Rueda and Schladow (2002). In the 36 years since the McGarr and Vorhis study, seiches induced by seismic events have received little examination. Unlike previous earthquakes known for generating seiches (e.g., the 1964 Alaska earthquake), ground motions during the Denali earthquake were well recorded on a variety of seismometers worldwide. The Denali earthquake therefore provides us with an opportunity to examine ground motions that initiate seiches in water bodies at large distances. Barberopoulou et al. (2004) did some analysis for the surface oscillations setup in water bodies during the Denali earthquake. It was found that a residential swimming pool of 10 m width and 2 m depth has a fundamental period of oscillation of 4.5 sec (0.2 Hz), a period that was strongly excited by seismic waves from the Denali earthquake (Fig. 2). This estimate is in agreement with the observations of sloshing in swimming pools during the earthquake (Table 1). Therefore resonance in the fundamental mode is a reasonable explanation for the surface oscillations induced in swimming pools during the Denali earthquake. Figure 8 shows that the Denali earthquake, with dominant wave periods of 10 to 30 sec, could set shallow water bodies with widths of 20 to 300 m into fundamental mode resonance. The 10-to 30-sec periods (0.1-0.033 Hz) are also the periods that the deep Seattle basin amplifies relative to the glacial deposits, making these periods the most likely to produce fundamental mode seiches. The predicted fundamental periods of sections of Lake Union (approximately 200 sec; Barberopoulou et al., 2004) are longer than the dominant periods of the seismic surface waves, and the water-wave periods described in the eyewitness reports. Seismic amplitudes from the Denali earthquake at 100 sec (0.01 Hz) are relatively low, far smaller than the amplitudes at 10-sec periods (0.1 Hz) that dominate the surface-wave signal (Fig. 2). Furthermore, long-period seismic Root mean square (rms) is sampled every 6 min, and each point is computed for a 3-min window centered at the sample time. The rms is computed from waveheight deviations that are sampled every second. The light line is the computed rms deviation assuming the water waves are a scaled version of an actual seismogram of the Denali earthquake recorded at a station near Tacoma (illustrated at the top of the figure using the same time scale). To scale the wave heights so that the peaks of both rms curves match at 6.6 cm requires that the maximum 0-to-peak water wave amplitude at the gauge was about 26 cm.

The graph shows the maximum vertical amplitude of wave motion as a function of channel width using a reflection coefficient of 0.9 at the walls of the channel.

The top four traces are from locations in Alaska whereas the bottom five correspond to locations in Washington state. The origin time of the earthquake in local time in Alaska is shown by the solid vertical line. Figure 8. Lines showing the change in fundamental period as a function of width for a swimming pool with the range of depths shown at the inset. Merian's formula has been used for the calculation of the period (Lamb, 1932;Proudman 1953). waves (\u03fe10 sec) undergo relatively modest amplification within the Seattle basin compared with waves of shorter period ( Figs. 4 and 6). Such long water-wave periods also conflict with observers' reports, which describe a series of waves 5-20 sec apart. The mismatch between the fundamental period of sections of Lake Union and the periods of observed water waves can be explained by higher-order modes of resonance excited by the seismic forcing. Surface waves from the Denali earthquake provided 10-30 cycles of motion over a 100-to 300-sec period (Fig. 2). This is a sufficiently long duration of forcing to excite higher modes of resonance. We model the response of swimming pools and portions of Lake Union using a simple model of a water body (\"canal\") of rectangular cross section and infinite length (Lamb, 1932;Russell and Macmillan, 1952;Proudman, 1953;McGarr, 1965;Wilson, 1972). Following Lamb (1932) and Proudman (1953) we assume a water body with vertical boundaries at distances x \u202b\u05e1\u202c 0 and L. We constrain the motion in the x-z plane (one-dimensional flow) and simplify the geometry by assuming a flat, horizontal bottom. In this model, horizontal motion of the sides of the water body generate water waves that constructively interfere with waves generated at the opposite wall. In the rectangular model we assume that energy is fed into the water body through the horizontal movement of its boundaries (McGarr, 1965). Because we consider longperiod motion (seismic surface waves have wavelength of several kilometers) we assume the forced walls of the water body to be moving in the same direction at the same time (i.e., the water body is much smaller than a half-wavelength). Then it can be shown that the water elevation g at any time t and point x is given by equation 1 (McGarr, 1965): where F is the forcing function (horizontal ground acceleration), k a damping constant, h the depth of the water body (constant in our case), the wave velocity, and L c \u202b\u05e1\u202c gh \u038a the distance between the boundaries of the water body.  . In all cases a reflection coefficient of 0.9 is assumed for waves that bounce back and forth between the walls of the basin. In this model the forcing is applied at the boundaries (x \u202b\u05e1\u202c 0, L) and the response of the water surface is \"measured\" at a selected position x between the walls. As a forcing function, we used a ground motion recording from station WISC near Lake Union (Fig. 9a). For computations we used a modified version of equation 1 (H. Mofjeld, personal comm., 2004) with the forcing input being ground velocity rather than acceleration. The elevation of the water at any point x and time t is given by the superposition of reflected and incident waves off the boundary walls. The rectangular model (Fig. 9) gives reasonable estimates for the large swimming pools, with computed wave heights in excess of 0.3 m being consistent with observations of water sloshing over the sides of the pools. We set the width of the large pool (22.1 m) to match the period of the pool's fundamental mode with the period of the largest seismic waves, in an attempt to find the maximum expected water-wave amplitudes. Such dimensions for a swimming pool are within the range of 17-25 m that are standard for pools in schools, country, and sport clubs where many of the observations of sloshing originated. For small pools the model predicts only 4-cm wave heights, which are large enough to be noticeable but too small to cause sloshing over the sides of the pools (Fig. 9). The simple model indicates that a cross section of Lake Union (width, 800 m) would produce water waves with amplitudes of up to 20 cm. We know that amplitudes were large enough to be noticeable, with the collection of reports suggesting water-wave heights of at least 30 cm along the shores of the lakes. Considering the uncertainty and incompleteness in the observations, the model agrees fairly well with the vertical motions of the water observed in the swimming pools but may slightly underestimate those in Lake Union. To demonstrate the effect the Seattle basin has on water bodies we have computed water levels using the accelerogram recorded by station WISC (Seattle basin) and station GNW (bedrock; Figs. 9 and 10). The seismic waves recorded at GNW would not produce large surface oscillations in any of the water bodies we considered. The predicted watersurface oscillations for location GNW do not exceed 2 cm. Water bodies located on the basins would produce water waves about 10 times as large (Figs. 9 and 10). Most estimates of the vertical amplitude of the water level during the Denali earthquake are derived from observations of swimming pools. We do not have many estimates around the lakes and only a few estimates refer to vertical motion at Lake Union. Most observations from lakes in the Puget Lowland refer to horizontal displacements or runup distance on the shore. These runup distances are often large (1-5 m) but depending on the sloping beach the vertical Figure 11. Expected wave heights for three rectangular water bodies under Nisqually earthquake forcing. (a) Velocity record section at WISC station is used as input to our model. (b) Computed wave height at the edge of a large pool whose dimensions (width, 22.1 m; depth, 2 m) are chosen to provide a fundamental period of 10 sec. (c) Computed wave height in a small pool with width, 10 m, depth, 2 m. (d) Computed wave height in Lake Union (width, 800 m; depth, 8 m). In all cases a reflection coefficient of 0.9 is assumed for waves that bounce back and forth between the walls of the basin. heights they correspond to can be much smaller (i.e., 20-30 cm). The lack of water-level measurements makes it difficult to conclude how well our simple model approximates the true wave motions. Despite these uncertainties we can still use the rectangular model to estimate wave heights in Lake Union during other types of earthquakes. Since the accelerometers of the PNSN were installed, the only major local earthquake recorded was the 2001 M L 6.8 Nisqually earthquake. We have used the recording of the Nisqually earthquake from seismic station WISC in the Seattle basin as input to the model (Fig. 11). Under Nisqually earthquake forcing we see waterwave amplitudes that are comparable to those calculated for the Denali event (Fig. 11) although their frequency is much higher than the water waves produced by the low-frequency Denali surface waves. We note that no unusual water waves were reported during the Nisqually earthquake. The absence of observed seiches and the results of the model appear to agree that water waves were not considered unusual during the Nisqually earthquake. The frequency content of the Nisqually earthquake signal was much higher than that of the Denali. This would not be surprising given that the Nisqually earthquake is a local deep (52 km) event generating relatively small surface waves compared with near-surface events. The signal from the distant Denali earthquake in Washington included long periods and duration and generated unusual water motion (easily noticeable) unlike that produced by ship traffic or winds. In contrast the higherfrequency wave motion during the Nisqually earthquake probably was either confused with other generating sources (i.e., ship traffic) by observers who were also distracted by the strong shaking and damage caused by the earthquake, or the water activity was not surprising enough for observers to report. A few observations of water waves were made during the 1949 and 1965 earthquakes (Table 2). These earthquakes were similar to the Nisqually earthquake in location, magnitude, and depth (54 and 63 km)."}, {"section_title": "Discussion and Conclusions", "text": "We used the spectral-ratio technique to document the amplification of long-period seismic waves by the Seattle basin, shallow glacial sediments, and bedrock sites. We find large amplification at frequencies of 0.2-1 Hz, which is in agreement with previous studies (Pratt et al., 2003), but we also see amplification at longer periods. Most of the amplification we observe is caused by shallow deposits, whereas the deep basin strata further amplify waves at frequencies of 0.04-0.2 Hz (5 to 25-sec period). Spectral ratios confirm that there is amplification at other locations outside of the Seattle basin where sedimentary deposits overlay the bedrock. In an effort to explain the generation of water waves in Lake Union, we have used a simple model of a rectangular basin to compute water-wave heights due to prolonged seismic forcing of water bodies. The forcing functions we used were seismic recordings of the distant, Denali earthquake and recordings made in Seattle during the deep Nisqually earthquake of 2001. This model predicts amplitudes in Lake Union of \u03f320 cm during the Denali earthquake and comparable water-wave amplitudes during the Nisqually earthquake. The absence of reported water activity during the Nisqually may be due to the higher frequency content and shorter duration of the Nisqually signal. Despite demographics, there is a remarkable correlation between the distribution of water-wave reports during the Denali earthquake and the largest seismic wave amplification in the Puget Lowland. The documented long-period amplification by the sedimentary basins underlying the Puget Lowland, and the results of our simple model suggest that the water waves observed in Lake Union were caused by prolonged seismic forcing caused by the amplified waves in the Seattle basin. Although the results do provide suggestions for what caused the unusual water motion they also highlight the need for further investigation using more realistic models and examination of other types of earthquakes. In particular, a complete investigation would have to include the full geometry of the lake. The latter is important since variable bathymetry and shoreline (among other things) may be responsible for enhanced wave heights in selected locations through focusing. Since the 1964 Alaska earthquake, a comprehensive water-level-recording network, including tide gauges operating at the time of that earthquake, has largely been re-moved, resulting in much less water-level data to work with. Estimates could be significantly improved using instrumentation to record water levels at high-frequency rates in key locations because this would provide data for model testing."}]
