The federal government has recognized the need for data that track environmental and land use changes, and an increasing number of large-scale databases are being produced. Data on temporal changes of wildlife populations at the large scale are less widely available, although states have developed rich datasets that provide wildlife managers with such trend information. Combining wildlife and environmental data is potentially of great interest to landscape ecologists, resource managers, and agricultural policy makers for assessing the influence of land-cover changes on wildlife abundance at regional scales.\nA primary challenge in using these data comes from reconciling the methodological, spatial, temporal, and scientific components of the data sources (Wang, Nusser, and Clark 1997) . It is difficult to combine data from separate studies because of disparate subject matter objectives and target populations, differences in definitions of variables, and varying sampling and measurement procedures in space and time. When combining records or data summaries from these studies, it is important to ensure that studies are sufficiently well matched with respect to the analysis objective, particularly when interpreting the estimated relationships between variables derived from the data. In addition, methods that are appropriate for the data structures and sample designs for the original surveys should be considered. Problems may arise when the two sources are combined, such as multi-collinearity in modeling relationships among correlated variables from the combined database.\nTo explore these issues, we consider a case study to evaluate the environmental impact of the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), one of the largest agricultural initiatives to set aside land and promote habitat benefits for wildlife populations. We focus specifically on the effects of CRP on ring-necked pheasants (Phasianus colchicus). In 1985, the Federal Food Security Act authorized the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP),which established perennial cover on highly erodible land previously used for row crops, and resulted in rapid, large-scale change in land use. In Iowa, almost 1 million hectares (ha) of land were converted from corn and soybean cropland to perennial grassland in two to three years, starting in earnest in late 1986. Since CRP implementation, local conditions for population growth and increased diversity have been improved for many avian species (Warner 1994; Kimmel et al. 1992; King and Savidge 1995; Best et al. 1997; Clark, Schmitz, and Bogenschutz 1999) . Although conservationists have used such information about the potential value of changes in amount and diversity of habitat for wildlife since the outset of the program (Berner 1988; Brady and Hamilton 1988) to justify CRP policy alternatives, few studies have addressed the large-scale effects.\nTracking such rapid and large-scale changes in land use and wildlife population responses is difficult because there are many smaller-scale complexities that comprise the ecological mechanism by which CRP affects conditions for avian populations. Intensive study is costly and necessarily restricted in geographic extent, factors that are limitations when evaluating large scale policy decisions. However, it is possible to link wildlife population changes with land use changes on relatively large scales using data routinely collected by state and federal agencies. Most state wildlife resource agencies, including the Iowa Department of Natural Resources (IDNR), collect data on population levels for game species such as ring-necked pheasant (Suchy, Munkel, and Kienzler 1991; Iowa Department of Natural Resources 1997) . Federally sponsored surveys that monitor the status and trends of land use, natural resources, and agricultural practices offer environmental data relevant to wildlife populations, including the U.S. Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis program (Scott 1998) , the Census of Agriculture (USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service 1999), and the U.S. Department of Agriculture National Resources Inventory (NRI) (Nusser and Goebel 1997) . We were particularly interested in the National Resources Inventory (NRI), which is a sample survey designed to provide information on status and trends for land use and natural resource conditions on nonfederal land in the U.S. The NRI has become useful to landscape ecologists because it tracks temporal trends on individual sample points throughout the U.S. and thus is well suited for studying large-scale changes in land use and natural resources (Nusser, Breidt, and Fuller 1998) .\nDatabases like the NRI have been used before in various ways to investigate relationships between wildlife populations and land use patterns. In most cases, counts of wildlife populations are related to presence of landscape features such as CRP, without explicitly treating temporal trends in either wildlife or land use data. For example, Brady, Flather, Church, and Schenck (1993) examined northern bobwhite Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) counts from Kansas and related them to county-level agricultural statistics from the NRI and Agricultural Census. Riley (1995) took a similar approach to associating the IDNR pheasant survey data with prevalence of CRP at the county level in Iowa, and several studies have related the agricultural landscape to neotropical migrant bird populations at the county level by using BBS and USDA agricultural statistics (Reynolds, Shaffer, Sauer, and Peterjohn 1994; Rodenhouse, Best, O'Connor, and Bollinger 1993) . Flather, Brady, and Inkley (1992) linked BBS counts to landscape data from the NRI along with land cover data from the U. S. Geological Survey to study the effectiveness of a planning model for wildlife resources.\nOur goal was to extend these approaches to consider relationships in temporal trends for land cover/use and pheasant populations. The scientific objective of the study was to investigate whether large-scale landscape changes induced by the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) were associated with temporal trends of pheasant populations in Iowa. The statistical approach involved (1) identifying a common spatial unit to link the IDNR annual pheasant count data and NRI data on land use and agro-environmental variables; (2) modeling temporal changes within each spatial unit for each database separately to generate summary parameters for land use and pheasant population trends; and (3) modeling the association among pheasant population trends and land cover/use changes to obtain estimates of parameters that provide meaningful descriptors of relationships between pheasant population and landscape trends. In the remainder of the article, we describe the data sources used in this study and provide details on the statistical methods used to select a common link polygon, to generate estimates of pheasant population and land cover/use trends, and to assess correlations among changes in pheasant population and land cover/use parameters. We summarize these methods by outlining a general framework for performing analyses of wildlife populations using state and national data sources."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "IOWA NRI DATA", "text": "The NRI survey is based on a stratified two-stage area sample (Nusser and Goebel 1997) . In Iowa, NRI strata are typically 3.22 by 9.66 km in size. The primary sampling unit (PSU) is a \u223c64 ha area, 0.80 km on each side. In the second stage of sampling, three points have been selected within each PSU according to a restricted randomization procedure that insures geographic spread (Goebel and Baker 1987) . The 1992 sample for Iowa contains 7,061 PSUs and 21,143 points. Natural resource data that reflect growing season conditions for each PSU and point are gathered primarily by interpreting low-altitude photography and ancillary materials such as soil maps and county agricultural records. A point-level database was created for the 1992 NRI, containing land use data for 1982, 1987, and 1992 . This database includes imputed points that incorporate temporal changes observed for PSUs and larger resource areas within counties, resulting in improved precision for estimates of change relative to a two-phase estimation approach (Breidt, McVey, and Fuller 1997) . There are 27,949 points in the final public database for Iowa, of which 6,826 are imputed. Imputed points represent conditions for 683,367 ha or 4.7% of Iowa's 14,540,250 ha.\nTo create a database commensurate with the rural scope of the pheasant database, we included only those points that were not designated as built-up or urban in 1982, 1987, or 1992 (95% of Iowa's land area). We used exploratory analyses to identify four land cover/use categories for the analysis: (1) corn and/or soybean row cropland; (2) hayland, grass hayland, and grass/legume hayland); (3) pastureland, grass pastureland, and grass/legume pastureland; and (4) CRP. We considered land cover/use indicator variables for wheat, oats, and farmsteads, but these variables were omitted because their prevalence was so infrequent that model parameters were unaffected by their inclusion.\nTo explore appropriate spatial links for the two datasets, we also included variables identifying the Major Land Resource Area (MLRA), eight-digit Hydrological Unit Code (HUC), and the county in which the point is located. MLRAs are multicounty areas distinguished by regions of relatively homogenous climate, physiography, soils, and land use (USDA Soil Conservation Service 1981). HUCs designate geographic areas for a surface drainage basin or a combination of drainage basins (Seaber, Kapinos, and Knapp 1987) . Finally, a point weight was retained for each point in the database (Nusser et al. 1998 ). The weight (in 100s of acres) is a measure of the land area represented by the point and its data."}, {"section_title": "IOWA ANNUAL PHEASANT ROADSIDE SURVEY", "text": "The pheasant roadside survey conducted by IDNR uses methods typical of state-level wildlife surveys in the Midwest designed to obtain information on population trends (Iowa Department of Natural Resources 1997). The sampling units are 233 current and historical routes, each approximately 48 km (30 miles) long. Routes occur along rural gravel roads in all of Iowa's 99 counties, and were selected purposively by IDNR staff in representative areas of the landscape where pheasants might be observed. Routes were digitized using an ARC/INFO geographic information system (GIS). Counts for these routes are viewed as an indicator of population trends rather than an estimate of pheasant populations.\nNearly all of the routes originally established have been surveyed using standardized protocols (Suchy et al. 1991 ) each year since 1962. IDNR technicians drive the routes in early August and record the number of hens, chicks, broods, and cocks observed in each segment. Our emphasis was on long-term changes, so we omitted the few routes for which there were less than 10 observation years between 1982 and 1995. Although observation conditions are standardized, the extremely cool and wet weather in Iowa during the summer of 1993 delayed nesting , which reduced counts significantly. We accounted for the abnormally low counts in 1993 in our pheasant trend model."}, {"section_title": "A COMMON SPATIAL POLYGON FOR ESTIMATING NRI AND PHEASANT TRENDS", "text": "A key step in combining data is identifying a method of linking the information contained in the databases. We used a spatial polygon that could be identified by variables in both databases as the basis for this link. Exploratory analyses indicated that polygons defined by the intersection of MLRA and HUC (hereafter referred to as watershed polygons, see Figure 1 ) were suitable for developing polygon-level land cover/use and pheasant trend models. We investigated smaller polygons defined by MLRA \u00d7 HUC \u00d7 county boundaries, but many of the MLRA \u00d7 HUC \u00d7 county polygons were so small geographically that they contained either no NRI points or no pheasant routes. The MLRA \u00d7 HUC watershed polygons were more consistent with regard to the ecological conditions such as land use and physiography, and model diagnostics indicated that data available from NRI sample points and pheasant survey routes within watershed polygons explained a higher proportion of variation for pheasant population growth models than other spatial aggregations. Each of the resulting 81 watershed polygons was considered an observational unit for summaries of pheasant and land cover/use trends.\nTo investigate regional differences, the 81 watershed polygons were grouped into six regions corresponding to MLRAs within Iowa (Figure 1 ). We labeled each MLRA region with descriptive names corresponding to regions recognized by the IDNR (Suchy et al. 1991) : northern row crop, northeastern grain, Mississippi River, western livestock, eastern livestock, and southern pasture."}, {"section_title": "NRI MODEL FOR LAND USE CHANGES", "text": "Our goal was to develop simple summaries of land cover/use changes using NRI data. We started by creating indicator variables for the presence (1) or absence (0) of land cover/use category j (corn/soybean, hayland, pastureland, CRP) for point p in polygon i over NRI survey years (1982, 1987, and 1992 ). For CRP, the possible values for the data triplet representing presence or absence of CRP over the three NRI years are 000 (never enrolled in CRP), 001 (enrolled in CRP after 1987), and 011 (enrolled in CRP by 1987). For the three other land cover/uses, any pattern for the triplet is possible.\nTo characterize trends at a point for a particular NRI land cover/use, we created two summary measures from these data. The first summary measure (referred to as the sample mean) is the average of the values in the data triplet for land cover/use j at point p in polygon i, or X jip = k/3, where k is the number of years out of the three possible study years that land cover/use j was present at point p in watershed polygon i. This measure is interpreted as the relative frequency of land cover/use j at point p over the three study years.\nA second summary measure focused on temporal trends in land/cover use at a point and is defined to be the slope obtained by regressing the presence/absence indicator variable for land cover/use j for point p in watershed polygon i on time t, where t = 0 for 1982, t = 5 for 1987, and t = 10 for 1992. The possible values of the summary measure for point p in watershed polygon i and land cover/use j are: We calculated the weighted average of the sample means for land cover/use j in watershed polygon i\nwhere w ip is the NRI point weight in units of 100s of acres for point p in polygon i. The weighted average of the slopes for land cover/use j over points in polygon i, \u03b4 ji , was calculated in a similar manner. For CRP, only X ji was calculated because the restricted set of temporal patterns yields equivalent values for the sample mean and slope. Thus, seven summary statistics were available for analysis. The summary statistic X ji is interpreted as the mean fraction of area in watershed polygon i over the three survey years that was occupied by land cover/use j, and is an indicator of the relative magnitude of a particular land cover type within a watershed polygon over the 10-year period. The summary statistic \u03b4 ji can be interpreted as the average rate of change in the presence of land cover/use j within polygon i over the three NRI survey years."}, {"section_title": "MODEL FOR PHEASANT TRENDS", "text": "The first step in summarizing pheasant trends in watershed polygons was to create watershed assignments for routes by overlaying the pheasant route coverage with MLRA and HUC coverages in a GIS (Figure 1 ). When a route crossed two or more watershed polygons, we assigned the segment to the watershed polygon that contained the longest portion of the 48 km route segment.\nTo estimate changes in pheasant population counts, we used a piecewise linear regression model (Fuller 1969 ) that permits different growth rates in log counts prior to and after 1987, when the bulk of land was converted under CRP. Let Y it be the total pheasant count in watershed polygon i in year t divided by the total route length (km) in watershed polygon i, where i = 1, . . . , 81 watershed polygons, and t = 0, 1, . . . , 13 years (0 corresponds to calendar year 1982). Our model for the log pheasant count was\n\u03b3 i + \u03b5 i11 for t = 11 \u03b2 0i + \u03b2 1i t + \u03b5 it for t = 6, . . . , 10, 12, 13 (2.1) with the restriction \u03b1 0i + 5\u03b1 1i = \u03b2 0i + 5\u03b2 1i to guarantee that the two line segments meet at t = 5 (1987). The parameter \u03b3 i was included as a discrete and short-term dip in the 1993 (t = 11) pheasant population level discussed earlier. For watershed polygon i, the parameter \u03b1 0i represents the log pheasant count at the beginning of the study period (1982) , \u03b1 1i represents the slope of the log pheasant count before full CRP implementation in 1987, and \u03b2 1i represents the slope of the log pheasant count after full CRP implementation in 1987. The parameters \u03b1 0i , \u03b1 1i , and \u03b2 1i and are of ecological interest because they summarize hypothesized responses to changes in land use. For example, we expected that large-scale implementation of CRP might stimulate the rate of increase of pheasant populations in a region of the state (Figure 2) .\nWe explored the use of a first-order autoregressive error model to account for the serial correlation in counts for each specific route in a polygon. However, the magnitude of the autocorrelation parameter was typically near zero (average estimate = 0.069, se = 0.033, n = 81), indicating little autocorrelation in the residuals after trend was accounted for in the model. Only three of the 81 autocorrelation parameters were statistically different from zero at p = 0.10 using a Durbin-Watson test. Because of these results, we assumed that for polygon i, the e it were uncorrelated, and used ordinary least squares to estimate the parameters in the pheasant trend model for each polygon."}, {"section_title": "MODEL LINKING PHEASANT TRENDS WITH NRI ESTIMATES OF LAND USE CHANGES", "text": "A model linking estimated pheasant trends with NRI estimates of land use changes was developed for dependent variables corresponding to the estimated pre-and post-CRP growth rate variables,\u03b1 1i and\u03b2 1i , and the difference in growth rates,\u03b2 1i \u2212\u03b1 1i . Because there was a strong relationship between estimated initial log population levels,\u03b1 0i , and each of the three growth rate variables, we included\u03b1 0i as a covariate along with the seven summaries of NRI trends, X ji and \u03b4 ji corn/soybeans, hayland, pastureland, and CRP land (mean only). Correlations among\u03b1 0i and the seven NRI land cover/use variables were also strong. For example, the correlation between the mean of hayland area and the mean of corn and soybean cropland area was \u22120.85 and the correlation between the mean of hayland area and the mean of pastureland area was 0.66. Therefore, we used principal component analysis to create new regression variables that were linear combinations of the seven NRI covariates and\u03b1 0i (Rawlings 1988) . Our objectives were to avoid problems associated with collinearity among these covariates and to reduce the number of explanatory variables. Principal components analysis was applied to the full dataset using a correlation matrix. Because we wanted to account for differences in regional responses to the CRP program, we included intercepts for each of the six regions.\nThe model for each of the rates of change,\u03b1 1i and\u03b2 1i , and the difference,\u03b2 1i \u2212\u03b1 1i , was a linear function of principal component variables with separate intercepts for each region. For example, the model for\u03b1 1ri , the estimated rate of change of log pheasant counts before CRP implementation in polygon i within region r, was defined a\u015d\nwhere \u00b5 r is the unknown mean rate of change in region r = 1, 2, . . . , 6; Z 1i , Z 2i , and Z 3i are the scores for the first three principal components for watershed polygon i; \u03b8 1 , \u03b8 2 , and \u03b8 3 are unknown regression parameters; and \u03b5 ri \u223c N (0, \u03c3 2 i ) are assumed to be uncorrelated. A weighted least squares approach was used to estimate the model parameters for all three response variables (\u03b1 1i ,\u03b2 1i ,\u03b2 1i \u2212\u03b1 1i ), where weights were defined to be the inverse of s 2 i , the mean square error from the regression for polygon i under model (2.1). Weighted least squares estimation was implemented by dividing the response variables and explanatory variables by s i (e.g.,\u03b1 1ri /s i , Z 1i /s i ) and using SAS PROC REG (SAS Institute Inc. 2000) to obtain ordinary least squares estimates of the parameters using the transformed variables. We applied this approach so that weighted estimates of the parameters could be obtained and outputted residuals were corrected for the heterogeneity (assumed by the model) prior to producing residual plots and influence diagnostics in PROC REG. Regression diagnostics calculated by SAS include studentized residuals and measures of influence for observations that may affect parameter estimates, variances of parameters, and predicted values. Plots of residuals against predicted values and explanatory variables, as well as normality tests and plots for the residuals were also examined. Guidelines suggested by Rawlings (1988) were used to interpret diagnostics."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "LAND USE CHANGES BASED ON NRI SUMMARY VARIABLES", "text": "CRP did not exist in 1982, but by 1987, an estimated 3.4% (489,712 ha) of nonfederal rural land in Iowa had been enrolled in CRP, and by 1992, this value had increased to 5.7% (825,359 ha) (Figure 3) . Statewide, corn and soybean cropland decreased between 1982 and 1987, but increased in 1992 to near the original level in 1982, in contrast to CRP objectives to set aside land for conservation. Further, the total area of hayland and Iowa, 1982 Iowa, , 1987 Iowa, , and 1992 pastureland decreased as CRP was established, indicating a net swapping of hayland and pastureland for CRP. When considering regions, CRP was most prevalent where initially cropland was less prevalent and hayland and pasture land were more common (Southern Pastureland region). In regions of the state where mean CRP was relatively low (Northern Row Crop region), there was a decrease followed by a rebound in corn and soybean cropland (relatively large changes in surface areas between NRI surveys), and a negative correlation between mean CRP and the slope for corn/soybean cropland was observed."}, {"section_title": "PHEASANT TRENDS", "text": "In 1982, pheasant population levels were substantially different among the regions (Table 1 ). The mean of the estimated log initial count (\u03b1 0i ) was greatest in the Southern Figure 2 ).

During the years following CRP implementation, our estimate of the statewide trend (< 1% per year) was not different from zero. Using BBS data for the same years, Sauer et al. (1997) also estimated a rate of change of pheasants that was not different from zero."}, {"section_title": "PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS ANALYSIS FOR NRI AND INITIAL POPULATION VARIABLES", "text": "The coefficients for the first three principal components (PCs) are shown in Table 2 .

We interpreted the first PC as representing the availability of perennial grassland habitat suitable for pheasants, due to the positive coefficients for mean CRP area, mean hayland area, and mean pastureland area, and the negative coefficient on corn/soybean row cropland area. The second PC appeared to be related to the change in land use during the period of CRP, especially transition rates in corn/soybean cropland and hayland. Larger positive values of the second PC are associated with higher rates of change in the fraction of corn/soybean area over survey years and lower rates of change for hayland. The third PC was positively associated with higher initial pheasant populations, larger areas of CRP, higher rates of change in pastureland, and lower rates of change in row crop and hayland, indicating subtle shifts in the relative difference between pastureland and hayland changes."}, {"section_title": "PHEASANT TRENDS IN RELATION TO LAND USE CHANGES", "text": "Regression diagnostics for all three regressions indicated that the residual distributions were consistent with a normal distribution. Residual plots and values for studentized residuals did not reveal outliers for any of the response variables. A small number of influence diagnostics for estimated parameters fell outside the range indicated by Rawlings (1988) , but results were unchanged by deleting these observations and thus they were retained in the estimation dataset. Regression results indicated that the first and third principal component, overall perennial habitat and relative difference in pastureland and hayland change, had little influence on the growth rate of pheasant populations before and after CRP or on the difference between the two growth rates. As a result, we present results for a reduced model that included the six regional intercepts and the second principal component.\nR-square values and parameter estimates from the reduced model are noted in Table 3 for each of the three pheasant growth rate variables. The percent of variation explained by the hypothesized models ranged from 38-60% for the three response variables. The rate of change in log pheasant counts prior to CRP,\u03b1 1i , was not associated with Z 2ri , the second principal component with larger rates of change for row crops and lower rates for hayland areas (Table 3 ). The estimated regional intercepts (\u03bc r ), indicating the mean rates of change in log pheasant population before 1987, were all positive except in the Mississippi River region, where the rate was not different from zero. Estimated post-CRP rates of change from 1987 through 1995,\u03b2 1i , were negatively associated with Z 2ri . That is, larger values of\u03b2 1i were associated with larger rates of change in hayland area and lower net rates of change in cropland (Table 3 ). The post-CRP rate of change in pheasant populations was not different from zero in the majority of regions. However, in areas with a higher prevalence of cropland (Northern Row Cropland), the growth rates were positive. In the Southern Pastureland region, where cropland is a relatively smaller component of the landscape, the mean rate of change of pheasant populations after CRP implementation was less than zero, indicating that in this area, CRP was not associated with significant improvements in pheasant habitat conditions.\nThe difference in the estimated mean slope of pheasant trends before and after 1987 was\u03b2 1 \u2212\u03b1 1 = 0.005 \u2212 0.042 = \u22120.037(SE = 0.063). On a statewide average basis, implementation of CRP did not increase the rate of change in log pheasant counts compared to the rate in the years before CRP. However, differences in the pre-and post-CRP slopes of the pheasant trends were negative in the Northeastern Grain, Western Livestock, and Southern Pastureland regions (Table 3) , where populations ended the study period with average growth rates that were negative or near zero after starting with positive average growth rates prior to large-scale CRP implementation (Table 1) . The difference in slopes before and after CRP implementation tended to increase where rates of change in hayland were larger and where rates of change in row cropland were smaller (Table 3 ). In the Northern row crop region the area of hayland was relatively stable, the rate of change of cropland increased, and\u03b2 1 \u2212\u03b1 1 was not different from zero.\nIn summary, implementation of CRP did not result in more rapidly growing pheasant populations in Iowa. However, in regions like Northern Row Cropland and Eastern Livestock, where NRI data indicated that the initial perennial habitat base was lower and where CRP replaced cropland, the effect on pheasant population growth rates was positive. Nearly the opposite trend occurred in the Southern Pastureland region, where addition of CRP land to substantial hayland and pastureland likely exceeded the optimum mixture in the landscape."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "Our goal was to develop an analysis approach that uses data from a federal sample survey that tracks land cover and use over time and a typical state-level wildlife survey to evaluate the impact of a large-scale environmental initiative on wildlife populations. This is a common need for state and regional biologists who are charged with monitoring and maintaining wildlife resources.\nOur approach was based on a structured framework for combining disparate data sources. The steps of our approach could be broadly described as: (a) identify environmental variables of interest in each dataset; (b) establish a common geographic link (e.g., watershed polygons) that serves as the common unit of observation for both datasets; (c) develop data summaries describing time trends and other patterns within observation units for each dataset; and (d) estimate parameters that describe relationships among the summary statistics from the two datasets using statistical models. This paradigm is sufficiently flexible to be applied to a broad range of settings.\nIn using this approach, several decisions need to be carefully considered. For example, final selection of the geographic polygon analysis unit should be reached after examining the ecological question of interest, the original survey designs and variables for the two data sources, and the data density within and among units. A sensitivity analysis comparing alternative definitions for the observation unit used to summarize information in each dataset is useful to discern the effect of the observation unit on the ability to detect relationships among environmental variables. Our preliminary analyses of alternative units led to a natural polygon that supported biologically meaningful interpretations.\nIn developing summary models, biological mechanisms must be considered as well as statistical aspects. We were able to develop a relatively simple model describing pheasant trends that incorporated a long-term shift due to CRP and a temporary shock from the 1993 floods. The high degree of correlation among covariates was resolved using principal components analysis, but other approaches, including returning to the original land use variables, would have been possible. Weights accounted for unequal variances among polygons for estimated pheasant growth rate parameters in the regressions relating pheasant summaries to land cover and regional variables.\nExploratory analyses were used to examine the assumptions underlying the pheasant models and the model relating pheasant parameters and land cover/use patterns. For example, an autoregressive error structure was considered for the pheasant trend model and found unnecessary. Regression diagnostics were used to assess the model describing the effect of regions and land use principal components on pheasant growth rates. Land cover/use summaries were sufficiently simple that tables could be used to examine underlying patterns. The estimated parameters from the initial land cover/use and pheasant models are associated with error, raising the question of whether a measurement error framework should be considered for the regression of pheasant parameters on land cover/use summaries. Measurement error models were explored for this application (Wang, Nusser, and Clark 1997) , but the measurement error variance was found to be small relative to other sources of variation.\nIn our application, combining NRI data with data from the Department of Natural Resources annual pheasant survey yielded valuable insights about wildlife population responses to the implementation of the Conservation Reserve Program. In particular, since time series data were summarized for each observation unit, we were able to identify land cover/use changes important to pheasant population trends and to explore sub-state differences. The approach cannot capture the local, short-term variation in counts that is characteristic of individual survey routes (Suchy et al. 1991) , or important ecological conditions such as the spatial arrangement of perennial grasslands ) and variation in cover quality within CRP (Kimmel et al. 1992; Best et al. 1997; Delisle and Savidge 1997) .\nThe combination of data types revealed some ecological and management implications that were not obvious before our study. Although CRP was intended to retire highly marginal cropland from production and at the same time provide wildlife habitat benefits, our analyses indicated that the interchange of land use types was not that simplistic. The NRI data indicated that corn and soybean cropland area was as large in some regions in 1992 as it was in 1982 before CRP was implemented. Proportionately more CRP land was established in regions of Iowa where cropland was initially less prevalent. But in regions where CRP replaced cropland, wildlife benefits were greatest, even though the absolute amount of habitat created was relatively small.\nAs efforts are made to revise CRP policies to provide multiple environmental benefits, it becomes important to be able to distinguish regional variation in those benefits. Using our framework and the NRI, surveys of wildlife like the pheasant counts could be combined with erosion data, wetlands data, and other environmental data to develop targeting indices that identify regions where CRP would be of greatest environmental benefit. Trade-offs will exist between alternative objectives, but the approach we have demonstrated could be a valuable tool in regionally targeting conservation programs as a part of land management policy."}]
