The development of disease-modifying treatment strategies requires objective characterization techniques and quantitative biomarkers able to identify AD with higher accuracy and at a much earlier stage than clinically based assessment [1] . Given that structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (e.g., T1 weighted) on 1 to 3 Tesla clinical scanners allows the in vivo assessment of changes such as medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA) due to AD, it has been proposed to fulfill the role of quantitative biomarkers in recent reports [2, 3] .\nWe have developed a sophisticated automated image processing method for the purpose of evaluating MTA in the context of AD. We recently proposed a single, highdimensional morphological metric called the disease evaluation factor (DEF) extracted from T1-weighted MRI and able to track and estimate disease state [4] . In our previous report we provided estimates of this metric's efficiency at the discrimination of cognitively normal, control subjects (CTRL) from probable AD patients, as well as the prediction of conversion in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects to probable AD.\nThorough technique verification, validation, and evaluation are necessary, however, in order for imaging biomarkers such as the DEF to be used in clinical trials enrichment, and more importantly, as a diagnostic aid to community physicians. As an essential component of the verification process, comprehensive metrological investigation of MRIbased metrics must include reliability testing.\nReliability is an important component of the precision of a measurement and relates to the consistency of measurements taken by a single person or instrument on the same item and under the same conditions. A less-than-perfect test-retest reliability causes test-retest variability, reducing confidence in the result and decreasing the test's statistical power. Reliability testing is particularly important for MRIbased metrics, which, while acquired with similar protocols, will show dissimilar intensity contrasts for the same tissue types [5] . These systematic and random variations are machine dependent and can be corrected for the most part via image denoising [6] , bias field inhomogeneity estimation [7] , and intensity standardization [8] .\nIn this paper we investigated the reliability of our DEF metric through analysis of cross-sectional (i.e., one timepoint) scan/repeat scan and scan/rescan images from two multicentric studies. First, we took advantage of the fact that subjects in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study received two within-session T1-weighted scans at their baseline visit to test for scan/repeat scan analysis. Further, we employed data on three participants in the Pilot European ADNI that had been scanned at seven different sites in a short timeframe to test for Scan/Rescan reliability. We report minimum clinical trial sample size increases at various different levels based on the calculated detection threshold.\nReliability analysis is an important, necessary, and often overlooked step between bench and bedside in the research and clinical contexts."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Ethics.", "text": "Institutional review boards of all participating institutions approved the procedures for this study.

We ensured there were no statistical differences in reliability between scan/repeat scans in either CTRL or probable AD groups using the diagnostic provided by ADNI (cf. Figure 2) . probable AD subjects (right). While the between-group difference was significant, there were no statistical differences in reliability within each diagnostic group.\nAs reported previously [4] , the difference in DEF averages between probable AD and CTRL was 55%. At this level, the minimum trial size required to detect this difference is 62 individuals for both samples (\u03b1 = 0.05; \u03b2 = 0.50) (cf. Figure 3 ). Due to the 1.97% minimum precision threshold of the technique, to reach identical power the trial size must increase to 68 individuals.\nTo evaluate whether the scan/repeat scan distance was smaller than the distance to any one image's nearest neighbor (scan or repeat), we proceeded by calculating all pairwise distances between subjects in the scan/repeat dataset. The comparison shows that the nearest neighbor in nearly all cases was the scan/repeat pair, as opposed to one of the possible neighbor (cf.

Verification consists in assessing that the system is built according to its specifications (i.e., assessing that the system is built correctly) and that test data is accurate. Validation consists in assessing that the system actually fulfills the purpose for which it was intended (i.e., assessing that the correct system was built). Evaluation consists in assessing that the system is accepted by the end-users and performs well for a specific purpose (i.e., assessing that the system is valuable). These are important, necessary, and often overlooked steps between bench and bedside in the research and clinical contexts.\nIn this study, we proposed a reliability analysis of our high-dimensional morphological metric in a large-scale multicenter setting. Reliability is a necessary, but not sufficient, component of validity. Our scan/repeat and scan/rescan results demonstrate that DEF is a reliable metric for medial temporal lobe atrophy estimations.\nWe further estimated minimum precision threshold that must be added to the effect size to obtain true cohort sizes in the case of clinical trials. While this resulted in increased number of subjects, this increase is somewhat negligible, especially when comparing trial sizes using DEF to those obtained with other metrics, for example, ADAS-Cog [22] or MMSE [12] , as mentioned in Schuff et al. [23] .\nWhile large datasets represent one of the strengths of the current study, it is not without its limitations. First is the lack of systematic pathological evaluation in both the Classification group and the ADNI data. The former implies that the classification function is not optimal for the task of discriminating CTRL from AD; the latter relates to the stability of the DEF. Further, while the mean and confidence intervals are relatively tight, standard deviations tend to be elevated. While it makes the DEF metric suitable for group studies, more work would be required for individual predictions. However, by design, we refrained from using techniques (e.g., within-subject registration, within-subject intensity normalization) that are specifically aimed at removing random and/or systematic errors in individual subject scanning that are not relevant to the pathology. For example, it is expected that within-subject registration would increase spatial concordance, and hence positional variability in the projected intensity and deformation spaces. Such techniques should be considered when continuing our investigations regarding the longitudinal reliability and overall validity of the DEF.\nInternational Journal of Alzheimer's Disease Mahalanobis distance relative difference (%) Figure 5 : Relative difference in % for the DEF factor between different scan/rescan image pairs for Pilot European ADNI subjects (3 subjects at 6 sites; 18 scan/rescan pairs).
