[{"section_title": "", "text": "\u2022 Much more glyphosate (pounds of active ingredient) was applied to soybean than to corn fields; \u2022 Glyphosate was used on more soybean than corn acres; \u2022 Herbicide use practices were consistent with glyphosate-resistance management on fewer soybean acres (60 percent) than on corn acres (82 percent); and \u2022 Glyphosate-resistance management was more likely to be done proactively on corn acres and more likely to be done reactively, in response to GR weeds, on soybean acres. Managing glyphosate resistance is more cost effective than ignoring resistance . Simulation results over a 20-year period show that herbicide choices that help manage glyphosate resistance differ from short-term herbicide choices that ignore glyphosate resistance in three important ways. Choices that manage resistance (1) use glyphosate during fewer years; (2) often combine glyphosate with one or more alternative herbicides; and (3) most importantly, avoid applying glyphosate in consecutive growing seasons. As a result, glyphosate resistance is managed more cost effectively, and after about 2 consecutive years of managing resistance, the cumulative impact of the returns received exceeds that received when ignoring resistance. Corn and soybean growers responded similarly to the reported presence of GR weeds or declines in glyphosate effectiveness. The most common survey response-consistent with glyphosate-resistance management-was to use other herbicides in addition to glyphosate. Growers used this practice on over 84 percent of corn acres with GR weeds and on 71 percent of soybean acres with reduced glyphosate effectiveness. The next most common response was to increase the amount of glyphosate used. Growers used this practice on 25 percent of corn acres with GR weeds and 39 percent of soybean acres with reduced glyphosate effectiveness. Corn growers who reported GR weeds and soybean growers who reported reduced glyphosate effectiveness realized lower returns than similar corn and soybean growers who did not report them. In addition, corn and soybean growers who used glyphosate alone received lower yields and returns than similar corn and soybean growers who used at least one other herbicide in combination with glyphosate. Although the crop growers using more than one herbicide had higher production costs, the additional costs were more than offset by higher yields. Economic incentives encourage cooperative use of resistance management practices (RMPs) . Simulations show that weed-seed dispersal from a field where crop growers ignore resistance when managing weeds could reduce the returns on nearby fields, and that the reduction could be larger for a nearby field where growers manage resistance than where they ignore it. This result suggests that corn and soybean growers have an economic incentive to encourage neighbors to use RMPs and may also be aware of the incentive. Some soybean growers in Arkansas and North Carolina are responding to such incentives and collaborating in the management of herbicide-resistant weeds."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Glyphosate-known by many trade names, including Roundup-is an herbicide effective for controlling many weed species. Because alfalfa, canola, corn, cotton, soybean, and sugar beet varieties have been genetically engineered to tolerate glyphosate, crop growers can spray entire fields planted to glyphosate-tolerant (GT) varieties, killing weeds but not the crops. This practice makes it easier to manage weeds using less tillage (Fawcett, 2002;NRC, 2010), which can help reduce soil erosion and improve soil quality and water conservation (Reeves, 1994(Reeves, , 1997Kaspar et al., 2001;NRC, 2010;Price et al., 2011;Fernandez-Cornejo et al., 2014a). Glyphosate was first marketed in 1974 under the name Roundup. Its use increased rapidly with the commercial introduction of GT corn, soybeans, and cotton in 1996 and patent expiration in 2000, which led to the availability of relatively inexpensive generic equivalents. Glyphosate is reported to be less toxic and less persistent in the environment relative to the herbicides that it replaced (Malik et al., 1989, Duke andPowles, 2008;NRC, 2010). The National Research Council (2010) reported that glyphosate is biodegraded by soil bacteria and it has a very low toxicity to mammals, birds, and fish. 1 As a result, glyphosate has been the most widely used pesticide in the United States since 2001 (Fernandez-Cornejo et al., 2014;Grube et al., 2011;Osteen and Fernandez-Cornejo, 2013). U.S. crop growers now plant 93 percent of their soybean acres and 85 percent of their corn acres to genetically engineered (GE) herbicide-tolerant (HT) varieties ( fig. 1). 2 The emergence of the HT varieties led corn and soybean growers to increase their use of glyphosate over time and reduce their use of all other herbicides. During 1996During -2003, herbicide use in corn and soybean production declined from about 293 million pounds of active ingredient to around 247 million pounds. Since 2003, herbicide use on acreage planted with these two crops has increased to almost 353 million pounds of active ingredient in 2013, with glyphosate accounting for over 57 percent of the total. 3"}, {"section_title": "2", "text": "The Economics of Glyphosate Resistance Management in Corn and Soybean Production,  Economic Research Service/USDA However, glyphosate is becoming less effective at controlling some weeds. The International Survey of Herbicide Resistant Weeds identified 14 glyphosate-resistant (GR) weed species currently affecting U.S. crop-production areas (Heap, 2014). 4 GR weeds can increase weed control costs and decrease crop yields (Shaw et al., 2011;Mueller et al., 2005;Scott and VanGessel, 2006;Culpepper et al., 2008;Culpepper and Kichler, 2009;Webster and Sosnoskie, 2010). Recent surveys of crop growers in 31 States suggest that acreage with GR weeds is increasing (Fraser, 2013). Because no new major herbicide active ingredients have become commercially available in the last 20 years, and because few new herbicides are expected to be available anytime soon (Harker et al., 2012), plant scientists have suggested that slowing the spread of GR weeds is a serious challenge facing U.S. crop growers (NRC, 2010). Exclusive reliance on one herbicide as the sole control tactic over the majority of the corn, cotton, and soybean acres in the Midwest and South is believed to be the main factor underlying the growing resistance of weeds to glyphosate. The Weed Science Society of America (WSSA) recently described an herbicide resistance management strategy that can reduce the spread of weeds resistant to a single herbicide (Norsworthy et al., 2012). The strategy involves understanding the biology of the weeds that are present and using diverse chemical, cultural, and mechanical methods to control weeds and reduce the production and dissemination of weed seeds. Using multiple herbicides with different modes of action (MOA), rotating use of different herbicide MOAs over time, and adopting several other resistance management practices (RMPs) can reduce the spread of weeds resistant to a single herbicide. 5 Source: USDA, Economic Research Service estimates. Data for GE adoption from Fernandez-Cornejo, J. Adoption of Genetically Engineered Crops in the U.S., Data Product, http://www.ers.usda.gov/Data/BiotechCrops/ July 2014. Data for herbicide use estimates come from the Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) Phase II and from USDA (2014). Regressions were used to interpolate herbicide missing data. Perhaps, because of a lack of information and economic incentives, many crop growers only use some RMPs, and they use them after resistance develops, in response to resistance, instead of using them to delay the onset and spread of herbicide resistance. Many crop growers reportedly believe that there is no need to use some RMPs, holding to a view that new herbicides will be available in time to control weeds resistant to currently available herbicides (Norsworthy et al., 2012). Some RMPs also increase current production costs, whereas the future benefits of delaying the spread of weed resistance by using RMPs are uncertain (Frisvold et al., 2009). Moreover, because weed seeds can disperse between fields by wind (Dauer et al., 2009), water, animals, and humans, including movement on farm equipment (Ross and Lembi, 2009), the effectiveness of RMPs in delaying resistance on one farm can depend on their use on neighboring farms. As a result, the susceptibility of weeds to glyphosate is an example of what economists refer to as a \"common pool resource\" (see Glossary), which is especially prone to overuse (Ostrom et al., 1999). 6 For mobile pests like insects and weeds, market-based economic incentives might be insufficient to ensure that resistance is managed in an economically optimal manner (Miranowski and Carlson, 1986;Livingston, 2013)."}, {"section_title": "Glyphosate-Resistance Management Strategies", "text": "Stakeholders are responding to the spread of GR weeds in a number of ways. Plant scientists focus on information campaigns that raise awareness of resistance and communicate the benefits of using RMPs (Duke and Powles, 2009;Norsworthy et al., 2012;Price et al., 2011;Vencill et al., 2012). The seed industry, government agencies, and other organizations are helping to finance these efforts (Farm Industry News, 2014; Boerboom and Owen, 2006). The seed industry is in the process of registering new GE crop varieties that can tolerate herbicides with a range of MOAs. GE corn varieties that tolerate glyphosate and glufosinate are currently available, and USDA has been reviewing industry proposals to deregulate new GE corn and soybean varieties that tolerate glyphosate and 2,4-D (now deregulated) or glyphosate and dicamba (Johnson et al., 2012;APHIS, 2014). 7 Some herbicide registrants have been offering incentives (such as per-acre payments) to purchase specific herbicide products with different MOAs than glyphosate's, such as acetochlor, atrazine, or other chemicals, to use with glyphosate on corn, cotton, or soybeans, depending on the type and brand of seed used. USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is promoting the use of RMPs under its Integrated Pest Management Herbicide Resistance Weed Conservation Plan. The agency provides financial assistance for developing conservation activity plans under the Environmental Quality Incentives Program. The plans provide guidelines to delay herbicide resistance and meet soil, water, and air quality objectives. 6 Some economists consider pest susceptibility to pesticides a common pool resource. When a pest moves from farm to farm, the pest control decisions made by any given farmer will affect the pest susceptibility (and returns) accruing to that farmer as well as those accruing to nearby farmers, but to a lesser extent. However, the effects of any one farmer's control decisions on the (susceptibility of) regional pest populations are practically negligible and the benefits and costs associated with those effects are not borne by any given farmer. Thus, those effects might not be accounted for in the farmer's control decision (Feder and Regev, 1975;Fernandez-Cornejo et al., 2014a). Pollen and seeds of many different weed species can disperse between farms in the air and in conjunction with the movement of animals and farm machinery (Fernandez-Cornejo et al., 2014a)."}, {"section_title": "The Economics of Glyphosate Resistance Management in Corn and Soybean Production, ERR-184", "text": "Economic Research Service/USDA In this report, we use new data from (1) the Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) and (2) the Benchmark Study (Shaw et al., 2011) to address several questions raised by the spread of GR weeds (see box, \"Data Sources\"): 1. How have corn and soybean growers managed weeds since GT crops became commercially available? Have weeds been managed differently for these two crops? What are the implications for managing glyphosate resistance? 2. How do herbicide choices that help manage glyphosate resistance and maximize longrun returns differ from herbicide choices that ignore resistance and instead maximize shortrun returns? Will an understanding of the differences in these choices help identify potential barriers to using RMPs and promoting their use? 3. How do the weed-management practices currently used in corn and soybean production compare to weed-management choices that maximize longrun returns? 4. What are the current effects of glyphosate resistance on production costs, crop yields, and returns? What are the current effects of using glyphosate by itself, which can exacerbate glyphosate resistance, relative to using glyphosate with at least one different herbicide MOA? Do the shortrun economic benefits of using glyphosate by itself outweigh the longrun costs associated with the spread of GR weeds? 5. How does the common-pool nature of weed susceptibility to glyphosate affect RMP use and production costs, yields, and returns? What are the implications for the use of RMPs in corn and soybeans? Phase III, conducted in the winter following the reference year, requests information on whole-farm revenues and expenses and characteristics of the farm operators and their households and businesses. Commodity versions of Phase III surveys request information on prices received and total expenditures for the crops surveyed in Phase II, which is used to estimate production costs and returns. Many, but not all, of the crop growers who respond to the Phase II survey also respond to the commodity version of the Phase III survey. We focused on corn and soybean production in the United States in this report because they are the leading U.S. crops in terms of planted acres. Furthermore, the growers of these two crops are currently managing glyphosate-resistant (GR) weeds, and we had new data for these two crops. We used Phase II data collected from corn (1996-2001, 2005, and 2010) and soybean (1996-2000, 2002, 2006, and 2012) growers to examine trends in the use of genetically engineered (GE) herbicide-tolerant (HT) varieties, herbicide use, and other weed-management practices. The Phase II corn (2010) and soybean (2012) questionnaires also collected information about the prevalence of and responses to GR weeds. We merged these data with data from the Phase III corn and soybean commodity versions of ARMS to estimate the impacts of GR weeds on corn and soybean production costs, yields, and returns. NASS uses a stratified sampling strategy to improve the reliability of estimates based on ARMS. Sampleselection probabilities vary by farm size, geographic area, and commodities produced. For example, larger operations are more likely to be sampled than smaller operations. Population estimates are produced by weighting sample observations to account for their probability of selection in the sample, unless incomplete subsets of the data are examined, as is the case when we compare specific groups of surveyed crop growers. Benchmark Study data . Plant scientists recently examined the effects of resistance management practices (RMPs) on crop yield, weed density, and returns to weed management (Shaw et al., 2011). Corn, cotton, and soybean growers in six States (IL, IN, IA, MS, NC, and NE) took part in the study, and each grower was asked to pick a field on his or her farm and split the field into two halves. On the first half, each grower was asked to manage weeds as usual and, on the second half, to use an RMP. On both field halves, data were collected on yield, weed density, herbicide use, tillage practices, irrigation use or nonuse, the field's latitude, and the type of seed that was planted during 2006-2010. We used the data collected from study participants who rotated GT corn and GT soybean and planted continuous GT corn and planted continuous GT soybeans during 2006-2009-excluding 2010 because of data quality issues and participant attrition. We used the data to estimate and then specify empirical relationships between crop yield and annual weed density in simulation models to examine the characteristics of different herbicide-use strategies. To identify ways to promote the use of RMPs in corn and soybean production, it is important to understand how growers have managed weeds in those crops since the commercial introduction of GT varieties in 1996. We examined ARMS data collected from corn and soybean growers during 1996-2012 to identify relevant trends and differences in corn and soybean management practices and explanations for the trends and differences. Since using glyphosate by itself repeatedly over time is the most important factor underlying the evolution of glyphosate resistance (Norsworthy et al., 2012), ARMS data suggest that herbicide-use practices in soybean production promoted the spread of GR weeds to a greater extent than herbicideuse practices in corn production. HT varieties (mostly GT varieties) were planted on more soybean than corn acres (see fig. 1); much more glyphosate (expressed in pounds of active ingredient) was applied to soybean than to corn fields (fig. 2); and glyphosate was used by itself on far more soybean than corn acres ( fig. 3). At the same time, the total quantity of herbicide active ingredient applied was much greater on corn than soybean acreage, and herbicides other than glyphosate accounted for the majority of the herbicides applied to corn. In addition, tillage, which controls weeds without encouraging herbicide resistance, was used more in corn than in soybean production, whereas no-till production systems were used more for soybeans than for corn (Horowitz et al., 2010). Weed management in corn fields involves not only glyphosate, but also other inexpensive herbicides, such as atrazine. In contrast, weed management in soybean fields is largely managed with glyphosate alone, because the next best alternative herbicides to control soybean weeds, especially broadleaf weeds, are more expensive, less effective, and can injure soybean plants (NRC, 2010). These facts help explain why GT soybean adoption was more rapid than GT corn adoption, why much more glyphosate was used in soybean than in corn production, and why far more soybean than corn acres received glyphosate by itself during 1996-2012.    fig. 3). 9 So, the majority of glyphosate-treated corn acres received at least one additional herbicide MOA throughout this period, with the lowest percentage occurring in 2005."}, {"section_title": "Herbicide Use", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Resistance Management Practices", "text": "Corn and soybean growers used a variety of RMPs during 1996-2012. ( Table 1 shows the use of a selection of those practices on corn and soybean acres based on ARMS data.) The majority of corn and soybean acres were scouted for weeds, exceeding 80 percent in most survey years, and this practice was used on an increasing percentage of soybean and corn acres, although corn acres scouted did not increase as much at the end of the period. Crops were rotated on over 75 percent of soybean acres and a smaller percentage of corn acres, with little change in either crop during this period. Tillage was used on over half of corn and soybean acres, with a greater percentage of corn than soybean acres being tilled. 10 Except for soybeans in 2012, there was a slight downward trend in tilled acres for both crops, perhaps in response to GR weed infestations. As Price et al. 2011observe, many acres under conservation tillage \"are at risk of being converted to higher-intensity tillage systems due to the inability to control\" glyphosate-resistant weeds. They add that \"the decline of conservation tillage is inevitable without the development and rapid adoption of integrated, effective weed control strategies.\" Moreover, if conservation tillage declines, its benefits (in reducing soil erosion and improving soil quality and water conservation) will also be at risk. The percentage of planted acres that received herbicides with MOAs other than glyphosate's declined at least initially, for both crops; however, the decline was much more dramatic for soybeans than for corn. The share of soybean acres receiving herbicides with MOAs other than glyphosate's declined steadily from 93 percent in 1996 to 29 percent in 2006, before increasing to 56 percent in 2012, perhaps due to the rising presence of GR weeds. The share of corn acres that received at least one herbicide MOA other than glyphosate's declined from 98 percent in 1996 to 80 percent in 2010. Other RMPs were used on less than 50 percent of corn and soybean acres during this period. A greater percentage of corn than soybean acres was cultivated for weed control, but acres receiving that practice declined steadily for both crops. For both crops, the practice of rotating or alternating pesticides to delay pesticide resistance increased during the first half of the period, then declined during the latter half, with the exception of the last years, perhaps in response to the presence of more GR weeds. Mowing field edges and roadways to prevent pest introductions increased after 2000, as did two other RMPs, previously used sparingly: adjustments to planting dates (to avoid weeds) and plant density or row spacing (to crowd out weeds). Finally, some practices (not included in table 1) showing very small differences in their use across time and between corn and soybean acres were \"planting a cover crop in the fall,\" on 0.9 percent of corn and 0.5 percent of soybean acres; \"keeping written records of weeds observed,\" on 21 percent of corn and 21 percent of soybean acres; and \"cleaning equipment between fields,\" on 29 percent of corn and 31 percent of soybean acres. Note: In the ARMS Phase II questionnaire, growers were asked to indicate if they used each resistance management practice \"with the purpose of reducing the spread of pests in the field.\" Source: USDA, Economic Research Service using data from the Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) Phase II."}, {"section_title": "11", "text": "The Soybean and corn acres that received glyphosate as the only herbicide treatment increased as more acres were planted to GT varieties, although this trend was much more pronounced in soybean than in corn production. Because corn production, unlike soybean production, benefited from inexpensive and effective alternative herbicides, the fact that the trend existed at all in corn production suggests that a lack of alternative herbicides was not the only underlying factor. A potentially important factor encouraging use of glyphosate by itself is that adding other herbicides with different MOAs can increase weed management costs, while the benefits in terms of resistance management are uncertain (not precisely known by the grower). Using multiple herbicides with different MOAs and, more importantly, rotating them over time can be very effective to delay the spread of weed resistance. However, because weed seeds can disperse between fields by wind, water, animals, and human activity, including the movement of farm equipment, the effectiveness of these practices on one farm can depend on their use on nearby farms. As a result, weed susceptibility to glyphosate may decline in the absence of coordinated action by all neighboring farms (Ostrom et al., 1999). Before exploring the potential effectiveness of policies promoting herbicide-use practices that delay glyphosate resistance, it is necessary to understand how those practices affect production costs, crop yields, and returns, and how those quantities might be affected by the potential for weedseed dispersal between farms. To accomplish these objectives, we combined a biological model of weed growth and glyphosate resistance with an economic model of weed management. 11 In this bio-economic model, a representative crop grower is assumed to observe the weed-seed density and glyphosate-resistance level in a crop field at the beginning of each year. 12 The crop grower then selects one of the following herbicide choices: (1) a pre-emergence (residual) herbicide, plus post-emergence glyphosate; (2) residual herbicide and glyphosate, plus an alternative (also postemergence) herbicide; (3) residual herbicide, plus an alternative herbicide; (4) just glyphosate; (5) glyphosate plus the alternative herbicide; or (6) just the alternative herbicide. 13 The model simulates the effects of the herbicide choice on weed growth, which determine crop yield and returns received each year, and the following year's initial weed-seed density and resistance level. 14 We used the model to examine two choices: managing resistance and ignoring resistance. Managing resistance involves a long-term view accounting for the cost and yield effects of glyphosate resistance over time and maximizing the present value of annual returns received. Ignoring resistance is a short-term perspective that ignores glyphosate resistance and instead maximizes the current-year annual returns received. Because using glyphosate promotes the survival and reproductive success of GR weeds relative to non-GR weeds, using glyphosate has shortrun and longrun costs. The shortrun costs include material and application costs. The longrun costs include the eventual reduction of glyphosate effectiveness due to resistance, which leads to larger yield losses and higher costs of controlling GR weeds. Choices that manage resistance account for the relationship between glyphosate use and resistance over time, while choices that ignore resistance consider only the current growing season and not the temporal relationship between glyphosate use and resistance. As a result, choices to manage or ignore resistance lead to different results over time, including disparities in glyphosate resistance and weed densities, which in turn lead to differences in management costs, crop yields, and returns. For illustrative purposes, we modeled one weed species-horseweed, one of the more widespread GR weed species affecting U.S. crop acreage-and three cropping scenarios: corn-soybean rotation, continuous corn, and continuous soybean. 15 We summarized returns, crop yields, herbicide costs, and weed densities for managing and ignoring resistance for a 20-year simulation period. The simulation results show that managing resistance differs from ignoring resistance in three important ways. First, managing resistance entails using glyphosate during fewer years than ignoring resistance. Managing resistance would require use of glyphosate in 9, 6, and 9 of the 20 simulated years for the corn-soybean, continuous-corn, and continuous-soybean scenarios, respectively. Ignoring resistance requires use of glyphosate in 12, 7, and all 20 of the simulated years for those same scenarios. Second, managing resistance would combine glyphosate with more herbicides than ignoring resistance. Managing resistance would combine glyphosate with both of the other herbicides included in this study in 7 of the 9 years glyphosate is used for the corn-soybean scenario, 6 of 6 years for continuous corn, and 7 out of 9 years for continuous soybean. Ignoring resistance would combine glyphosate with only the residual herbicide in 33 percent of the years glyphosate is used in soybean production for the corn-soybean scenario (2 of the 6 years) and 22 percent of the years glyphosate is used for the continuous-soybean scenario. Managing resistance always combines glyphosate with the other two herbicides whenever glyphosate is used in corn. Ignoring resistance generally combines glyphosate with the residual herbicide, but never adds an application of the alternative, post-emergence herbicide. Third, and most importantly, managing resistance generally entails not applying glyphosate during consecutive growing seasons. When managing resistance, there is a larger interval between years glyphosate is used than when ignoring resistance. 16 Except for the continuous-soybean scenario, managing resistance alternates years when glyphosate is used with at least 1 year when glyphosate is not used during the initial, simulated growing seasons. Choices that ignore resistance involve using glyphosate during the first 5 consecutive years for each scenario, and each year for the continuoussoybean scenario. As a result, glyphosate resistance develops much more quickly when resistance is ignored than when it is managed. Results from the bio-economic model show that managing resistance reduces returns in the first year of implementation but increases returns in the second and all subsequent years ( fig. 4). The cumulative impact of the returns received, reported as the annualized present value (APV) of returns, when managing resistance exceeds that received when ignoring resistance after 2 consecutive years ( fig.  4). 17 That is, managing glyphosate resistance will recover its initial lower APV of returns relative to ignoring resistance in about 2 years. 18 In addition, the difference in returns between managing resistance and ignoring resistance increases with the number of years of consecutive use. The gap widens because horseweeds are controlled much more effectively, and crop yields are higher, when managing resistance. Herbicide costs are also generally slightly higher, but the value of yield gains always exceeds the herbicide cost after less than 2 years. These findings suggest that the longrun benefits of managing resistance far exceed the additional shortrun costs. Note: APV = annualized present value. Source: USDA, Economic Research Service simulation results based on bio-economic optimization model; see also Appendix 1."}, {"section_title": "Figure 4", "text": "Differences between APV of returns received when managing resistance and when ignoring resistance, by cropping scenario "}, {"section_title": "Impacts of Weed-Seed Dispersal", "text": "The simulation results suggest that much more weed seed is produced in fields where resistance is ignored (using a short-term perspective) than in fields where resistance is managed (using a longer term perspective) (table 2). This finding suggests that the longrun benefits of managing resistance might be lower in fields located near fields where resistance is ignored. To explore this hypothesis, we modified the base model to simulate herbicide choices and returns to a \"grower\" for managing or ignoring resistance, for 3 crop rotations, when the \"neighbor\" either manages or ignores resistance (table 3). 19 The results show that for each crop rotation, the grower receives higher returns when: (1) the grower manages resistance, regardless of the neighbor's practice, and (2) the neighbor manages resistance, regardless of the grower's practice. One implication is that the grower receives a gain from managing resistance relative to ignoring it, and that the gain is greater when the neighbor also manages resistance (thereby producing and dispersing fewer weed seeds). For the example of corn-soybean rotation, the grower's gain from managing resistance in his/her own field is $58.92 per acre when the neighbor manages resistance and $24.42 when the neighbor ignores resistance. However, for continuous soybeans, the gain from managing resistance is less than for the other rotations and is negligible when the neighbor ignores resistance, only $0.04 per acre. 20 The grower has a larger gain when the neighbor manages resistance because the simulated weed-seed dispersal has less impact on the grower's returns than when the neighbor ignores resistance. Therefore, one effect of the neighbor's ignoring resistance is to reduce the grower's financial incentive to manage resistance. The difficulty in determining how operators of nearby farms manage weeds may likewise reduce incentive and, in turn, explain why some crop growers do not manage resistance, especially in soybean production. 20 Also for continuous soybeans only, the grower's ignoring resistance, when the neighbor manages resistance, would have slightly greater returns ($158.79 per acre), than the grower's managing resistance when the neighbor ignores it ($154.85). But when the neighbor manages resistance, the grower achieves even greater returns by managing resistance ($182.70). Simulated returns (APV) for a corn/soybean grower given the grower's management decisions and those of the grower's neighbor, three cropping scenarios Results from the bio-economic optimization model described in appendix 1. These results (APV) are for a 20-year planning horizon with a discount factor per year equal to 0.95 (Lence, 2000). APV = annualized present value. NA = Not applicable. Source: USDA, Economic Research Service using data from the Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) Phase II. Other implications of grower-neighbor interdependence are (1) that the grower has a financial incentive to encourage the neighbor to manage resistance because grower returns are greater when the neighbor manages rather than ignores resistance and (2) that the incentive is greater when the grower also manages resistance. For example, for the corn-soybean rotation, the grower managing resistance in his/her own field gains $42.16 per acre from the neighbor managing resistance, but the grower ignoring resistance gains only $7.67 from the neighbor's managing resistance. These results also suggest that the benefit of free-riding on the resistance management efforts of neighboring growers is relatively small. The returns received when the grower ignores resistance can remain low even if a neighbor manages resistance, and the grower's gain from the neighbor's managing resistance is also relatively small (for example, $3.97 per acre for continuous soybeans). The benefit that a grower's managing resistance transfers to neighbors is fewer and less frequent immigrant, GR weed seeds. Because this benefit is difficult to observe, it is easy to ignore, which suggests that improving communications and teamwork between neighboring growers could help promote resistance management. The simulation results show that the grower's gain from managing resistance is lower when the neighbor ignores resistance (table 3), which suggests that the common-pool-resource nature of weed susceptibility to glyphosate can reduce the returns possible from the grower's managing resistance (long-term perspective) relative to the grower's ignoring resistance (short-term view). For two reasons, common pool resources create a potential social dilemma, in which users seeking short-run, personal objectives lead to outcomes that are not desirable from anyone's longrun perspective: (1) it is particularly costly to exclude those growers who have a shortrun view from using the resource (non-excludability), and (2) their use by each grower reduces its availability to others (subtractability) (Ostrom et al., 1999). Without effective rules limiting access and providing incentives for users to invest in rather than exploit the resource, common pool resources are vulnerable to overuse. In our case, the common-pool-resource nature of weed susceptibility to glyphosate can reduce economic incentives to manage resistance. As a result, some crop growers might opt instead for short-term herbicide choices, hastening glyphosate resistance. Ostrom et al. (1999) document a wide range of common pool resources that have been effectively managed by resource users without government intervention, especially when people are able to communicate, sanction each other, or make new rules. As long as the proportion of free riders is not too high initially, cooperative agreements can be established, sustained, and expanded by resource users. Thus, the simulation results suggest that returns to glyphosate-resistance management can be increased by cooperation between crop growers. In addition, as we describe below, recent survey data suggest that the proportion of free-riders is not too high to preclude cooperation, which has already occurred in Arkansas (Smith, 2012) and more recently in North Carolina (Everman, 2014). To recap, the simulations suggest that herbicide choices that manage resistance pursuing a longrun economic goal result in higher returns over time than do herbicide choices that ignore resistance and pursue a shortrun economic goal. Managing resistance uses less glyphosate, combines it with alternative herbicides, and generally does not use it during consecutive growing seasons, so that resistance develops less quickly and returns are higher. However, the simulations also show that the common-pool-resource nature of weed susceptibility to glyphosate can reduce economic incentives for crop growers to use resistance-managing herbicide choices."}, {"section_title": "Glyphosate-Resistant Weeds and Corn and Soybean Grower Responses", "text": "To better understand the trends in weed-management practices used in corn and soybean production since the commercial availability of GT varieties, it is necessary to determine how many corn and soybean acres are currently affected by GR weeds and how corn and soybean growers are responding. As already shown, glyphosate use increased steadily on corn and soybean planted acres, as did the number of acres that received glyphosate by itself. However, sometime between 2006 and 2012 in soybean production, and 2005 and 2010 in corn production, the number of acres receiving glyphosate by itself declined as the number receiving glyphosate plus at least one additional herbicide MOA increased. As we will show, this reversal was associated with management responses to GR weeds in both crops. 21 The 2010 Phase ARMS survey asked corn growers, \"Has [the surveyed] field ever been infested with weeds resistant to glyphosate?\" According to the growers' responses, GR-weed infestations had been reported in only 5.6 percent of planted corn acres (4.5 million acres) at that time. The majority of those acres were in the Corn Belt (34 percent) and Northern Plains (46 percent), which account for the majority of U.S. corn acres. GR-weed infestations were reported in less than 4 percent and 10 percent of corn acres in those regions, respectively. GR-weed infestations were reported in higher percentages of corn acres in southern regions; over a quarter of corn acres planted in Georgia in 2010 had been infested with GR weeds as of 2010. The 2012 Phase-II ARMS survey asked soybean growers, \"Have you noticed a decline in the effectiveness of glyphosate in controlling weeds in [the surveyed] field?\" The growers reported a decline in glyphosate's effectiveness in 43.7 percent of planted soybean acres (32.5 million acres). Again, the majority of those acres were in the Corn Belt (47 percent) and Northern Plains (23 percent), which also typically account for the majority of U.S. soybean acres. A decline in the efficacy of glyphosate was reported in higher percentages of soybean acres in southern regions, including Appalachia (58 percent) and the Delta (55 percent), but the Corn Belt (46 percent), Northern Plains (40 percent), and Lake States (31 percent) were not far behind. Responses to these questions suggest that both corn and soybean growers believed they had experienced problems with GR weeds by 2010 and 2012, respectively, and that more soybean acres in 2012 than corn acres in 2010 were affected. However, because somewhat different questions were asked in 2010 and 2012, we cannot definitively conclude that the prevalence of GR weeds differs in corn and soybean fields. Corn and soybean growers responded similarly to their respective issues of the presence of GR weeds and decline in glyphosate effectiveness. Herbicide-use practices on 60 percent of soybean acres in 2012 were a substantial component of glyphosate resistance management. However, there are statistically significant differences in the prevalence of resistance management practices between soybean acres with and without reported declines in glyphosate effectiveness. Herbicide-use practices were consistent with resistance management on more soybean acres with reported declines in glyphosate effectiveness (66 percent) than without such reported declines (50 percent). For example, more soybean acres where growers reported such declines received glyphosate and at least one herbicide with a different MOA (62 percent) than did acres where growers did not report declines (45 percent). In addition, fewer soybean acres with reported declines in glyphosate effectiveness (31 percent) than without such declines (46 percent) received glyphosate alone. These findings suggest that glyphosate-resistance management could have been improved on more soybean acres in 2012 (up to 40 percent) than on corn acres in 2010 (up to 18 percent), by applying glyphosate with at least one other herbicide with a different MOA, or by applying an alternative herbicide instead of glyphosate. Moreover, these findings suggest that herbicide choices that delay resistance were more likely to be used proactively in corn than soybean production and that such herbicide choices in soybean production were more likely to be reactive-that is, in response to glyphosate resistance. The simulation results suggest that glyphosate resistance can be costly and that it can be economically beneficial to manage instead of ignore resistance (see table 3). Because the simulation results are based on a simplified model of reality, we complement the simulation results with more direct estimates of the costs of resistance. ARMS data provide detailed information on production costs, yields, and returns that can be used in conjunction with responses to the glyphosate resistance/effectiveness questions to estimate the economic impacts of GR weeds on both corn and soybean production. Estimating the impact of being in one group (for example, corn growers who reported a GR-weed infestation-the treatment group) instead of another group (corn growers who did not report a GR-weed infestation-the control group) by comparing the group means for an outcome variable of interest (e.g., returns per acre) can be misleading because of sample-selection bias (Heckman, 1979). The characteristics of growers and their farms can influence both the group they are in and their economic performance. For example, growers who operated smaller corn enterprises in 2010 were more likely to report GR-weed infestations than did growers who operated larger corn enterprises, which are often more profitable than smaller ones. Without accounting for the influence of enterprise size, comparing average returns per acre for growers who reported a GR-weed infestation to returns for those who did not, would likely provide a biased estimate of the economic impact of glyphosate resistance. Statisticians (Rosenbaum and Rubin, 1983), economists (Abadie and Imbens, 2006), and political scientists (Diamond and Sekhon, 2013) have shown that grouping very similar farms together before comparing mean outcomes can reduce sample-selection bias. The procedure, known as propensityscore matching, first chooses treatment and control groups (e.g., growers with and without reported GR weeds, respectively) that are statistically similar, based on a wide variety of characteristics other than the presence of GR weeds (e.g., enterprise size), before comparing group means (e.g., of peracre returns). (See appendix 2 for more details.) We used a propensity-score matching procedure to estimate the impacts of glyphosate-resistance on corn and soybean production in 2010 and 2012. The results suggest that corn growers who had reported a GR-weed infestation in 2010 realized significantly lower operating (-$60.19/acre) and total (-$67.29/acre) returns than similar corn growers who had not reported such an infestation (table 4). The results suggest that lower yields and higher chemical and fuel costs might have contributed to the shortfall in returns, although the differences in yields and chemical and fuel costs themselves were not statistically significant at the 10-percent level. These findings suggest glyphosate resistance contributed to a substantial reduction in returns to affected corn growers. Similarly, a propensity-score matching procedure suggests that soybean growers who had reported a decline in the effectiveness of glyphosate as of 2012 received lower total ($22.53/acre) returns than soybean growers with similar characteristics who had not reported such a decline (table 5). The estimates suggest that lower yields and higher chemical costs might have contributed to the lower returns, although the difference in yields is not statistically significant at the 10-percent level. These findings suggest that glyphosate resistance contributed to a 14-percent reduction in returns to affected soybean growers.  Impacts on returns, yield, and production costs of reporting a glyphosate-resistant weed infestation in corn, 2010  Impacts on returns, yield, and production costs of having reported a decline in glyphosate effectiveness in controlling weeds in soybean, 2012 Because both the literature and our simulation results suggest that using glyphosate by itself is the main factor underlying the evolution of glyphosate resistance, estimating the impacts on production costs, yields, and returns of using this practice is critical. If the returns when using glyphosate by itself exceeded, in the shortrun, returns when using herbicides that delay resistance, there would be an important barrier to resistance management. We used propensity-score matching to estimate the economic impacts of using glyphosate by itself, compared to using glyphosate and at least one different herbicide MOA, in corn and soybean production. The estimates suggest that corn growers who used glyphosate and at least one different herbicide MOA had higher operating costs ($15.36/acre due in part to higher chemical costs), yields, returns, and operating returns than did corn growers who were very similar, but used glyphosate by itself. However, differences in yields and returns were not statistically significant at the 10-percent level (table 6). The estimates suggest that soybean growers using glyphosate and at least one different herbicide MOA received statistically higher yields (4.31 bushels/acre), returns ($48.57/acre), and operating returns ($49.23/acre)-despite having higher operating costs ($11.41/acre)-than similar soybean growers using glyphosate by itself (table 7). Our findings for corn, but not for soybeans, are broadly consistent with results from Weirich et al. (2011), who used Benchmark Study data for the period 2006-2008 to study corn and soybean growers from Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Mississippi, Nebraska, and North Carolina. Weirich et al. (2011) compared the costs, yields, and returns from using the growers' usual weed control methods Table 6 Impacts on returns, yield, and production costs of using glyphosate by itself rather than using glyphosate and at least one different herbicide in corn, 2010 (e.g., using glyphosate) with the same measures resulting from following the academics' recommendations (e.g., use other herbicides in combination with glyphosate). They conclude that weed management costs were higher with more intensive management with herbicides. However, reduced weed pressure resulted in a trend toward higher crop yields, which offset the higher weed management costs. They also observe that the grower's returns \"will be equivalent in the short term, and, over time, long-term resistance management will delay the evolution of GR weeds in their fields, creating substantial additional saving.\" Similarly, our shortrun results for corn in 2010 indicate that the differences in mean yields and returns were not statistically significant between fields where glyphosate was applied with at least one different herbicide MOA and fields where glyphosate was used by itself (see table 6). However, our results for soybeans in 2012 show that the mean yields and returns were higher in fields where glyphosate was applied with at least one different herbicide MOA than in fields where glyphosate was used by itself (see table 7). The findings for soybeans suggest that using glyphosate by itself may not only exacerbate glyphosate resistance, but could also be a costly short-term management decision. Currently, shortrun economic disincentives do not appear to impede the use of glyphosate with at least one different herbicide MOA (at least for soybeans). The simulation results from the bio-economic model show that the returns when managing resistance are higher in the long term but lower in the first 1-2 years ( fig. 4) than when ignoring resistance. Thus, taking all the results together, we conclude that managing glyphosate resistance produces higher returns than does ignoring resistance, except possibly the first 2 years.

Because weed susceptibility to glyphosate is an example of a common pool resource, it can encourage glyphosate overuse, which can hasten glyphosate resistance. However, a wide range of common pool resources have been effectively managed by resource users who were able to communicate, sanction each other, or make new rules in situations where the proportion of free-riders was not too high (Ostrom et al., 1999). Under these circumstances, cooperative agreements have been established, sustained, and expanded by resource users. We used ARMS (phase 2) data collected from soybean growers in 2012 to identify the use of any of seven commonly recommended RMPs ever used to delay glyphosate resistance, to indicate whether weed-management costs increased as a result of using these practices, and to summarize perceptions on whether or not the RMPs would be more effective in delaying herbicide resistance if nearby growers also used them. 24 Crop rotation to delay glyphosate resistance was used on the largest percentage of GT soybean acreage (79 percent), followed by using the herbicide-label application rate (70 percent), controlling weeds at the appropriate time in their growth stage (70 percent), using herbicides other than glyphosate (59 percent), using tillage (42 percent), ensuring all weeds are killed after herbicide use (41 percent), and cleaning equipment between fields (24 percent). Weed-management costs increased on 20 percent of RMP acres using crop rotation, 32 percent using the herbicide-label-recommended application rate, 35 percent controlling weeds at the appropriate time, 62 percent using herbicides other than glyphosate, 41 percent using tillage, 53 percent ensuring all weeds are killed after herbicide use, and 21 percent cleaning equipment between fields. These responses suggest that cost influenced the extent of RMP use. To investigate whether the common-pool-resource nature of weed susceptibility to glyphosate influenced the use of RMPs, in the 2012 soybean ARMS survey we also asked growers if they believed the RMPs they used would be more effective in delaying herbicide resistance if operators of nearby farms also used them (the common-pool-resource beliefs question). Almost 53 percent of the soybean acres that used at least one RMP were farmed by soybean growers who answered \"yes\"; another 20 percent answered \"no\" (fig. 5). 25 Smaller shares of acres \"with GR weeds\" (reporting a decline in the effectiveness of glyphosate in controlling weeds) (20 percent) than without (28 percent) were managed by soybean growers who answered \"don't know,\" and these estimates are statistically different. 26 Sample averages indicate that soybean growers who answered \"yes\" to the common-pool-resource beliefs question used more RMPs than did other soybean growers; soybean growers who answered \"don't know\" used fewer RMPs (tables 8 and 9 and Appendix 2). The number of RMPs used by soybean growers who answered \"no\" or \"the nearest farm is too far away\u2026\" are not statistically significantly different from the number of RMPs used by other growers. We used propensity-score matching to estimate differences in the numbers of RMPs used, as well as differences in yields, production costs, and returns among growers holding different beliefs about the common-pool-resource nature of weed susceptibility to glyphosate. Soybean growers who answered \"yes\" to the common-pool-resource beliefs question used 17 percent more RMPs (p<0.01) than did similar soybean growers who chose another answer (table 8). The \"yes\" respondents also received higher yields (2.18 bushels/acre), higher returns ($35.62/acre), and higher operating returns ($28.98/acre). Soybean growers who answered \"yes\" were more likely to use herbicides other than glyphosate, use the herbicide-label-recommended application rate, control weeds at the appropriate time in their life stage, and ensure that all weeds were killed after herbicide use than soybean growers who answered the common-pool-resource beliefs question differently.

Soybean growers who answered \"don't know\" used 7 percent fewer RMPs than other, very similar soybean growers who chose one of the other answers (table 9). Soybean growers who were uncertain about the common-pool-resource nature of weed susceptibility to glyphosate received lower yields (-2.20 bushels per acre) and lower total (-$46.01/acre) and operating (-$39.00/acre) returns. Because it was difficult to determine whether or not nearby growers used RMPs, and which ones they used, it was not clear whether growers who answered \"yes\" to the common-pool-resource beliefs question would use fewer or more RMPs. Conceivably, growers who answered \"yes\" might use fewer RMPs if they expected to receive GR weeds from their neighbors, which would undermine efforts to delay glyphosate resistance. However, instead, growers who answered \"yes\" routinely reported to have used more RMPs and performed better financially than soybean growers who either did not believe in, or were uncertain about, the common-pool-resource nature of weed susceptibility to glyphosate.

Examples of cooperation among growers suggest that some crop growers recognize cooperation's benefits for managing glyphosate resistance. Glyphosate resistance has evolved in pigweed (Palmer amaranth) populations in the southern United States, where it infests cotton and soybean fields, reduces crop yields, and increases weed-management costs. Arkansas extension agents encouraged growers to use a zero-tolerance approach developed by University of Arkansas scientists to eliminate production of pigweed seeds in their crop fields by creating zero-tolerance zones and managing weed seed beds in crop fields, ditches, and turn rows with pre-plant and pre-emergence herbicides and tillage, when necessary (Smith, 2012;Yancy, 2012). In 2011, growers in Clay County, Arkansas, adopted this approach, followed by growers in Desha County in 2012. Also, soybean growers in North Carolina recently started a similar program that has been promoted aggressively (Everman, 2014). Finally, recall that resistance-management practices, at least those used in 2012 soybean production, were used on higher percentages of acres with reported declines in glyphosate effectiveness than acres without such declines, and the differences are statistically significant in most cases. This result suggests that resistance-management choices in soybeans in 2012 were more likely to be used to react to glyphosate resistance, rather than to proactively delay resistance, because growers were more likely to use RMPs after, rather than before, they noticed declines in glyphosate effectiveness. 2012 outcomes for soybean growers who answered \"don't know\" to the common-poolresource belief question in ARMS Notes: Propensity-score-matching estimates based on 2012 Phase II and Phase III ARMS data. 1,555 observations are in the initial dataset; 399 observations are in both matched samples.

While there are examples of neighboring growers in Arkansas and North Carolina cooperating to manage glyphosate-resistant weeds, further research is needed to determine the extent of such arrangements. Likewise, deserving further study is the role of outside stakeholder groups, such as agricultural extension specialists, crop consultants and university, industry, and government representatives, in the process of initiating, sustaining, and expanding these types of agreements. For example, simply knowing about the common-pool-resource nature of weed susceptibility to glyphosate does not appear to be enough to ensure that resistance-managing herbicide choices are used proactively to delay resistance, rather than reactively to stem declines in glyphosate effectiveness. Our results suggest that further cooperation among growers, particularly soybean growers, may significantly reduce the rate of glyphosate resistance and increase grower returns. Finally, economic research using future ARMS surveys and other data sources could continue to examine growers' use of weed-management practices, including strategies to manage weeds resistant to glyphosate or other herbicides and their effectiveness, and their effect on grower returns for corn, soybeans, and other crops such as cotton and wheat. Further studies may focus on (1) the rate and impacts of adoption of various HT seed varieties, including new ones tolerant to herbicides other than glyphosate, such as glufosinate with 2,4-D or dicamba; (2) changes in the use of herbicides, including glyphosate and other materials with various modes of action; (3) changes in the use of non-pesticide RMPs, such as increased tillage; and (4) the types and extent of cooperative arrangements among growers to manage resistance. In some cases, these studies may incorporate the potential economic and environmental tradeoffs between weed management and soil health due to the effects of tillage practices on both. where fg=[0.35, 1.00, 1.00]/ are the fractions of horseweeds that survive a glyphosate application, and fa=0.35(1.01) is the fraction of all horseweed genotypes that survive the alternative, post-emergence herbicide. 31 R C C C C C = + + + denotes the glyphosate-resistance level for the surviving weeds. C t (1), C t (2) and C t (3) are the susceptible homozygotes, heterozygotes, and resistant homozygotes, respectively. The resistance level for the seeds produced by these plants is based on the fraction of the population that self-fertilize, s f , and the fraction that mate randomly, (1-s f ). The resistance level also depends on the herbicide choice, which not only kills weeds but also reduces the ability of surviving weeds to produce seeds.  The fraction of seeds that survive herbicide choice h t is given by: where f rs =0.5 is the fraction that survive the residual herbicide, f gs =[0.12, 0.87, 0.87]/ are the fractions of each genotype that survive glyphosate and f as =0.12(1.01) is the fraction that survive the alternative herbicide.

Indeed, Heckman's (1979) test rejects the hypothesis that weed density, herbicide use, and tillage intensity are exogenous for each cropping scenario (Appendix tables 1-1, 1-2). To account for endogeneity and the separate effects of herbicide use and tillage on weed density, and then the effects of weed density on crop yield, two-equation systems are estimated for each cropping scenario using the generalized method of moments (GMM). 34 The GMM estimates indicate that corn and soybean yields declined with cumulative weed densities for each cropping scenario. Because the marginal impacts of weed density on corn and soybean yield are not statistically different across cropping scenarios, and because the overidentifying restrictions test rejects the exogeneity of the instruments in the continuous-soybean model at the 1-percent significance level, we base the marginal impacts of weed density for each model using the results for the crop-rotation scenario (Appendix tables 1-1, 1-2, 1-3 "}, {"section_title": "Finding Solutions", "text": "We solve for the managing resistance choices using dynamic programming, because it is the preferred method for solving dynamic optimization problems when information about the underlying state variables can be updated regularly.
