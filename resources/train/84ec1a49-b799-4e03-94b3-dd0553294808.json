Brain amyloidosis can be detected by molecular imaging techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET) using an amyloid-specific radioligand (e.g., 11 Clabelled Pittsburgh compound-B ( 11 C-PiB)) or through measurement of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A\u03b2 1-42 concentration [2] [3] [4] , both showing high correlations with postmortem measures of fibrillar A\u03b2 [5] [6] [7] . As amyloid PET and CSF biomarker collection rapidly become an integral part of research studies on normal aging and AD 8, 9 , the research findings have raised the possibility that biomarkers of brain amyloidosis may detect and quantify disease associated changes in the latent (i.e., normal cognitive function with evidence of AD pathology) and prodromal (i.e., mild cognitive impairment with stronger evidence of AD pathology) AD stages when disease-modifying therapeutic intervention may be most effective. However, many subjects are resistant to lumbar puncture required for CSF sample collection, especially if they are asymptomatic. Furthermore, limited availability, exposure to radiation, and financial burden of amyloid PET techniques hinder their widespread acceptance in clinical practice. Recently, three independent studies have shown that a combination of ADbiomarkers, cognitive measures, ApoE genotype, and plasma protein measures, could be a predictor of amyloid-positivity (A\u03b2+) with accuracy high as 85% [10] [11] [12] . Different yet complementary to these approaches, our goal is to identify a low-cost and non-invasive neuroimaging signature predictive of brain amyloidosis as a screening tool to identify subjects that are most likely to have high levels of brain amyloid or to be amyloid-free.\nStructural neuroimaging using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), has been shown to be useful in AD 13 diagnosis and is often used for assessment of subjects with memory problems, yet there is no protocol for identifying brain amyloidosis via MRI since no MRbased molecular imaging with a contrast specific to amyloid plaques has been demonstrated. Widespread availability, no radioligand requirement, no exposure to radiation, and lower cost are potential advantages of structural neuroimaging as a screening tool to identify brain amyloidosis. Various imaging studies related the brain amyloidosis to the downstream structural brain alterations across a wide range of cognitive impairments to better understand the sequences of AD-related pathophysiological events, to identify biomarkers of early ADrelated brain changes, and to assess the effectiveness of these biomarkers on predicting individuals' progression in the AD continuum [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . Though neuroimaging research came a long way in its ability to link brain amyloidosis and AD-related neurodegeneration, to what extend structural imaging predicts brain amyloidosis has not been explored thoroughly yet. In this study, we aimed (1) to identify an anatomical shape variation based neuroimaging predictor of brain amyloidosis in mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a transitional stage between normal aging and dementia with an increased risk of developing AD, and (2) to define a structural MRI-based brain amyloidosis score (sMRI-BAS), whose A\u03b2+ predictive power was validated on an independent MCI cohort. Furthermore, we compared the A\u03b2+ predictive power of the sMRI-BAS to those of Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype and hippocampal volume, two most relevant candidate biomarkers for the prediction of brain amyloidosis. Specifically, hippocampal atrophy, one of the most established and reliable AD imaging biomarker, progresses through the disease course, and is present even in healthy elders and MCIs who are most like to develop AD 21 . The relevance of ApoE-\u03b54 genotype for AD and its associations with AD-related biomarkers such as amyloid PET binding, CSF biomarker concentrations, structural, especially hippocampal atrophy, are well documented [22] [23] [24] ."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "Participants were recruited through the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) from 56 centers in the U.S. and Canada 25 .

ULD-template generation incorporated an unbiased approach where all brain images were first simultaneously affine transformed to adjust for global variations in brain positioning and scale, and then simultaneously deformed. MCI brain images were first affine aligned and then nonlinearly warped to this ULD-template using the LDDMM framework. The LDDMM was modeled as an evolution in time, with an associated smooth velocity vector field controlling this evolution. A scalar initial momentum map, \u03b1 0 parameterized the entire geodesic with which the optimal trajectory emanated from the ULD-template to reach a subject brain image on a Riemannian manifold of diffeomorphism 29 .

Once the mode, also known as latent variable (LV), have been determined, a set of weights can be calculated to predict an instance of the response variable from an explanatory variable (e.g., imaging data from a new subject). Specifically, by projecting \u03b1 dt onto the LV, an sMRI-BAS was estimated for each MCI. We used non-parametric permutation tests (n=1000) to assess the significance of the regression of projected composite PiB-SUVR on projected \u03b1 dt map and used the R 2 as the test statistics.

Specifically, dichotomous categorization (i.e., A\u03b2+ versus A\u03b2\u2212) showed 91% agreement (\u03ba=0.74) between PiB-PET and CSF A\u03b2 .

Anatomical shape variations predictive of brain amyloidosis (detected by 11 C-PiB PET) in MCI embraced a characteristic pattern of brain structures known for high vulnerability to AD pathology. The sMRI-BAS when combined with ApoE genotype, the most relevant genotype for AD, yielded a brain amyloidosis prediction with AUC=0.88 and greater than 90% sensitivity and specificity at 20% FPR and FNR thresholds in identifying A\u03b2+ and A\u03b2\u2212 MCIs in an independent validation cohort. Although as an independent predictor of brain amyloidosis ApoE genotype outperformed neuroimaging measures, we observed a significant 9% improvement in A\u03b2+ versus A\u03b2\u2212 classification accuracy and a drastic increase in sensitivity and specificity of the prediction model when sMRI-BAS and ApoE genotype jointly act as the predictors of brain amyloidosis. These results implicate independent contribution of each predictor in identifying MCIs with brain amyloidosis and the added value of the MRI measures beyond the effects of ApoE genotype. This study represents one of the first attempts to use an imaging technique that do not require amyloidspecific radioligands for identification of individuals with brain amyloidosis. Although, the dosimetry of amyloid PET is suitable for clinical and research applications, the effective doses range from 1.6 to 3.7 mSv 32, 33 , on the average greater than the natural radiation exposure of 2.0 mSv per year. Thus, amyloid PET contributes to a patient's overall longterm cumulative radiation exposure, which is associated with an increased risk of cancer 34 .\nThe spatial extent of neuroimaging predictors of brain amyloidosis observed in the prediction model MCI cohort is consistent with previous studies on biomarkers for early diagnosis of AD 25 . Multiple groups have now reported associations between A\u03b2 levels and brain tissue atrophy rates, especially the hippocampal and medial temporal cortical atrophy rates and ventricular expansion, even at mild stages of cognitive deficits 15, 35, 36 . Furthermore, brain atrophy in a characteristic pattern involving the medial temporal lobes (i.e., hippocampus and entorhinal cortex), paralimbic and temporoparietal cortices is a biomarker of AD-related neurodegeneration 25 . A surprising finding in this study is though the poor performance of hippocampal volume in classification of A\u03b2+ and A\u03b2\u2212 MCIs. One explanation could be the fact that both prediction model and validation cohorts included primarily amnestic MCIs to whom atrophy within the hippocampal complex 25 is common but might not be differentiating. Several research groups have independently investigated the relationship between brain amyloidosis and hippocampal volume in MCIs. It has been consistently reported that the global, regional, and also voxel-based correlations between 11 C-PiB PET brain amyloidosis measures and hippocampal volume are not significant 15, 16, 37 . Similarly, correlation between CSF A\u03b2 1-42 and hippocampal volume failed to reach statistical significance in various MCI studies [38] [39] [40] .\nOur finding of a distributed spatial pattern of anatomical shape variations as the neuroimaging predictor of brain amyloidosis suggests a greater involvement of a memory network including hippocampal complex in amyloidosis-related pathology in MCI. The transneuronal-spread hypothesis 41 proposes that an injury in a vulnerable site triggers a process, which then spreads across interconnected components. In a similar manner, the anatomical shape variations at the primary AD-pathology brain sites (e.g., middle temporal regions) may have driven the contribution from the brain regions traditionally not considered as AD-pathology-specific via the brain's intrinsic connectivity.\nStrengths of this study include the use of an advanced anatomical shape variation measure, unique detrending of cofounding effects, and use of a modern statistical analysis method. Most of the earlier studies on characterization of neuroanatomical changes have focused on the study of deformation maps, either using the associated Jacobian determinate of the transformations, as in the now ubiquitous deformation-based morphometry 42 , or have done the analysis directly on the displacement maps. Rather than using the associated Jacobian determinate of transformations or the vector-valued velocity or deformation fields, we formulated the prediction problem in terms of scalar initial momenta maps that completely encoded the geodesics on the manifold of diffeomorphisms. Use of a modern statistical method, PLS, allowed us to identify co-varying brain networks, providing maximum predictive value for brain amyloidosis in MCI. Conventional voxel-based methods, such as statistical parametric mapping, are not suitable for prediction models where the data from all imaging voxels are the high-dimensional and partly collinear predictors. When the space of the explanatory variables is of full rank, ordinary multilinear regression can be used but in practice the explanatory variable space is likely to be singular due to collinearity in the predictors. PLS is designed to deal with small sample size and multicollinearity issues in high-dimensional prediction modeling and searching for modes that explain maximal covariance between the explanatory and response spaces 30 .\nA relative weakness of this study is related to the etiologic and pathologic uncertainty in the MCI diagnosis as at least 30% of the MCI subjects have been found to harbor a non-AD pathology 43, 44 . Specific to our prediction model cohort, 8% of the MCI subjects were diagnosed with additional non-memory features, 6% were identified as due to etiology other than AD, and about 4% presented with depressive symptoms. These heterogeneities in the prediction model MCI cohort may have contributed to the brain amyloidosis and atrophy covariations in unexpected brain regions including the mid-brain and basal ganglia regions 45, 46 . Validation cohort MCI subjects that are identified as due to etiology other than AD and/or with non-memory features presented with relatively lower MRI-BAS (i.e., mean MRI-BAS of \u22121.73 compared to mean MRI-BAS of \u22121.35 estimated for amnestic MCI due to AD), resulting in greater false positive rates in predicting brain amyloidosis in this subgroup. A proper study with a larger sample size is warranted to better model the etiological and pathological heterogeneities in prediction of brain amyloidosis in MCI. Another limitation of our study is that both CSF and amyloid-PET biomarkers are proxy measures for the retention of fibrillar form of A\u03b2 and not necessarily provide a measure of oligomeric form of A\u03b2 accumulation, which might be the most relevant to synaptic toxicity.\nThe pathophysiological process of AD is thought to begin many years before the diagnosis of AD dementia. An understanding of the neuroanatomy associated with brain amyloidosis is significant because it may aid to identify individuals in prodromal phase of AD providing a critical opportunity for therapeutic intervention. The extend to which biomarkers of AD pathology ---e.g., A\u03b2 accumulation and structural alterations ---predict an MCI subject's subsequent clinical course remains to be determined since some of these individuals with AD pathology will never manifest AD related dementia in their lifetime. Multi-center studies enriched with neuroimaging and biomarker data will ensure future studies focused on the prediction of brain amyloidosis in a wider AD cognitive continuum including the latent AD stage. Together with the work of others 10, 11 , our findings could result in development of multidisciplinary and multimodality biomarkers of brain amyloidosis that are reliable, minimally invasive, simple to perform, and widely available. These may include detailed demographic characteristics such as family history, cognitive performance, and high-throughput biomarker technologies such as genomics and proteomics."}, {"section_title": "Supplementary Material", "text": "Refer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.
