[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. Each year, there are approximately 221,200 new cases of lung cancer, and lung cancer accounts for 27% of cancer-related deaths. 1 Most lung cancers are caused by cigarette smoking and secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure. Smoking causes 82% of lung cancer deaths, and SHS is the cause of an additional 5% of these deaths. 2 Furthermore, there are approximately 20,000 radon-induced lung cancer deaths annually; most of these occur in those who are also exposed to tobacco smoke. 3 Thousands of lung cancer deaths could be prevented each year if smoking and exposure to SHS and radon were reduced. [4] [5] [6] Comprehensive smoke-free laws that restrict smoking in all workplaces and public places are high-impact public health strategies for decreasing SHS exposure [7] [8] [9] and smoking prevalence. 10, 11 Comprehensive smoke-free laws are known to reduce the prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 12 myocardial infarction, [13] [14] [15] [16] coronary heart disease, 16, 17 stroke, 16 asthma, 16, 18 and ambulance calls. 19 The scientific evidence is clear that smoke-free laws improve public health by reducing disease prevalence. To date, most studies on smoke-free laws have examined changes in disease prevalence over relatively short periods, generally limiting their scope to a few years. 12 Diseases like lung cancer take longer to develop, and longitudinal data are required to accurately assess how smoke-free laws impact lung cancer incidence. Few studies have examined the association between tobacco-control efforts and lung cancer. A study by Pierce and colleagues 5 indicated that declines in lung cancer mortality in California between 1960 and 2002 followed declines in smoking, with a lag of 16 years. Other studies have examined the relation between lung cancer incidence/mortality and tobacco-control efforts; however, to date, those studies have not specifically studied the impact of smoke-free laws on lung cancer incidence. Polednak 20 compared states' lung cancer rates and mortality by using a tobaccocontrol index (TCI). States' TCI scores were calculated based on the average price per pack of cigarettes and smoking restrictions in workplaces and homes between 1992 and 1993. The TCI scores were negatively correlated with lung cancer incidence and mortality. Barnoya and Glantz 21 examined the impact of California's tobacco-control program on the incidence of lung and bladder cancers, both of which are caused by smoking, 2 compared with prostate and brain cancers, which are not related to smoking. The incidence of lung cancer fell after the implementation of California's tobacco-control program with a 1-year lag, the incidence of bladder cancer fell with a 3-year lag, and the incidence of prostate and brain cancer did not decline. California's comprehensive tobacco-control program included smokefree laws, media campaigns, school programs, and tobacco cessation. The California study was unable to disentangle the impact of specific strategies like smoke-free laws on lung cancer incidence. Although existing research provides strong evidence for the effectiveness of comprehensive tobacco-control programs in reducing lung cancer incidence, further research is needed to determine the specific impact of smoke-free laws on lung cancer rates.\nKentucky is an ideal location in which to study the impact of smoke-free laws on lung cancer incidence, because there are no statewide smoke-free protections; instead, smoke-free ordinances are enacted at the municipal level. Furthermore, there is variation in the strength of municipal smoke-free laws; nearly one-third of Kentuckians are currently protected by comprehensive, or 100%, smoke-free workplace and enclosed public places ordinances enacted in 26 communities. 22 Currently, 19 of the 45 smoke-free ordinances in Kentucky are moderate (100% smoke-free enclosed public place laws, including restaurants and bars, but not all workplaces) or weak (protecting workers and patrons in some public and workplace venues with significant exemptions [eg, age restrictions, enclosed smoking rooms, restaurants only]). In 2009, Kentucky raised the state cigarette tax from 30 to 60 cents per pack, 23 which was 1 of the lowest cigarette excise taxes in the nation as of January 3, 2017. 24 Since 2000, as a result of the Master Settlement Agreement, 25 Kentucky has spent, on average, $3 million per year on tobacco control, representing only 5.6% of what the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend for state tobacco-control programs. 26 Furthermore, Kentucky has 1 of the highest adult cigarette smoking rates (26.2%) 27 and the highest lung cancer incidence and death rates in the United States. 28 According to the Tobacco Use Survey-Current Population Survey, adult smoking rates in Kentucky ranged from 29.7% during 1995 through 1996 to 21.1% during 2014 to 2015. 29 The purpose of the current study was to examine the impact of municipal smoke-free laws on lung cancer incidence in Kentucky. We compared lung cancer incidence between counties without laws versus those with comprehensive smoke-free policies and moderate or weak laws. We hypothesized that lung cancer incidence rates would be associated with the strength of municipal smoke-free ordinances. We selected lung cancer as the outcome for this study, because most lung cancers are caused by firsthand smoking or SHS."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": "We examined lung cancer incidence in all 120 Kentucky counties from 1995 through 2014. We compiled information about each law or Board of Health regulation implemented over time, including the date and strength of the policy (ie, comprehensive [or 100%] 30 vs moderate/ weak 12, 31 ) from the Smoke-free Ordinance database at the Kentucky Center for Smoke-free Policy. According to that information, as of December 31, 2014, 33 municipalities had 1 or more smoke-free policies; the remaining Kentucky counties in the analysis did not have municipal smoke-free ordinances during the 20-year period. A summary of the annual incident lung cancer rates, implementation dates, and strength of the laws for each county that had at least 1 municipal smoke-free ordinance is provided in Table 1 . The first municipal smoke-free ordinance in the state was implemented in 2004, and the most recent was implemented in 2014. Ordinances or regulations in 12 of the 33 municipalities cover the entire county; the others were enacted by city governments. The remaining 21 municipalities are typically the largest city in the county. In this case, we classified the county as having this type of policy given that the major city was covered, consistent with prior studies. 32, 33 Although some additional counties had very limited smoking restrictions that applied only to government buildings (not 100% public policies), we did not include those laws in the study."}, {"section_title": "Selection of Lung Cancer Cases", "text": "We obtained data from the Kentucky Cancer Registry (KCR) from 1995 to 2014 (the latest data available) and identified 81,145 incident, or newly diagnosed, cases of lung cancer in Kentucky residents who were aged 50 years at the time of diagnosis. The KCR, which is part of the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Program of Cancer Registries, is the official population-based cancer-reporting system and includes all reported cases of primary malignant diseases diagnosed or treated at a Kentucky hospital. Since 1995, the KCR has collected uniform and complete data from all health care facilities in Kentucky, including freestanding treatment centers, nonhospital pathology laboratories, and physician offices. We received a total of 88,778 cases from the KCR/Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registry, including patient demographic data (eg, sex, age) and case-specific information (eg, site code, date of diagnosis, tumor stage). For these analyses, the number of cases was aggregated by county (120 counties), study quarter (range, 1-80), sex, and age group (ages 50-59, 60-69, and 70 years). We selected the cutoff age of 50 years a priori based on the typical age of diagnosis in Kentucky. Lung cancer is relatively rare among individuals aged <50 years in the state."}, {"section_title": "Population Demographics and Other Covariates", "text": "County-level demographic characteristics included the adult smoking rate, percentage women, percentage blacks, median household income, physician supply, observed radon values at the 75th percentile, and location type (urban/rural). The adult smoking rate, calculated as the weighted 3-year average from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System was included as a time-dependent covariate (recorded yearly). Weighted, 3-year, averaged rates were used, because the annual number of Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System participants in smaller counties often does not meet the threshold for smoking rate estimation. County estimates of the percentages of women and blacks and of the median household income were obtained from the 2004 US Census. Physician supply was measured using the number of primary care physicians per 100,000 population. 34 The 75th percentile, or upper quartile, of the distribution of county-level observed ; the upper quartile was chosen rather than an average because of the skewed distribution of radon values. Observed radon values were obtained from a state database that collected more than 60,000 radon values between 1990 and 2015. The 2003 Rural Urban Continuum codes were used to assign location type (urban or rural); codes from 1 to 3 denoted urban locations, and codes from 4 to 9 indicated rural locations. 36 "}, {"section_title": "Statistical Methods", "text": "Descriptive analyses, including means, standard deviations, and ranges or frequency distributions, were used to summarize patient-level demographic and clinical characteristics and county-level demographics. We used a generalized estimating equation to model quarterly incidence rates of lung cancer in each county over the study period with the GENMOD procedure in the SAS software package (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC). Given the rarity of a lung cancer diagnoses relative to population size, the negative binomial distribution was specified to allow for overdispersion or under-dispersion; the log of the size of the at-risk population for each combination of age category and sex was used as an offset variable. The model allowed flexibility in modifying the indicator for the strength of a municipal law to reflect policy changes that occurred over time. These changes included strengthening laws after initial implementation as well as changing from no law, to a municipal ordinance, or no change in law status. The generalized estimating equation model included the effect of law status (comprehensive vs none and moderate/weak vs none). Time (namely, the quarter of the study, ranging from 1-80) was included to control for secular trends. The observations were nested within county to link rates from the same location over time and adjust for population differences among counties that may be related to lung cancer incidence. Patient-level covariates included age category and sex. County-level covariates included the 3-year, weighted, aggregate adult smoking rate; percentage women; percentage blacks; median household income; primary care provider rate (as a measure of physician supply); 75th percentile observed radon values; and urban/ rural status. Relative risks and corresponding 95% confidence intervals were estimated for each model effect, and significance levels for the estimates were determined using Wald tests. All data analysis was conducted using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc), with an a level of .05 throughout. Table 2 indicates that the majority of patients with lung cancer were men (57.7%), and the largest percentage of those diagnosed with lung cancer were aged 70 years (48.2%), followed by ages 60 to 69 years (33.8%) and 50 to 59 years (18.1%). The largest percentage of incident lung cancer cases were staged as distant (47.1%), followed by regional (24.5%), localized (18.8%), and in situ (0.1%). Less than 10% of cancer cases were not staged (9.5%)."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": "The average county-level aggregate adult smoking rate was 28.7% (range, 18.9%-42.6%) ( Table 3 ). The average proportion of female residents was 50.2%; and, on average, 3.9% of county residents were black. The median household income was $33,400 (range, $18,400-$68,100). On average, there were 51.6 primary care providers per 100,000 population in each county (range, 0-171.0 providers per 100,000). The mean 75th percentile for county-level residential radon values was 5.1 pCi/L (range, 1.5-21.7 pCi/L). Most of the counties in the state are rural (70.8%). Table 4 indicates that counties that had comprehensive smoke-free policies had significantly lower relative risk of lung cancer compared with counties that had no smoke-free laws (P 5 .002). Individuals living in counties that had a comprehensive smoke-free policy were 7.9% less likely to be diagnosed with lung cancer compared with those living in counties that had no public policy protections. The difference between counties with moderate/weak laws and those without laws was not significant (P 5 .4). Other variables in the model associated with lung cancer risk included sex, age, adult smoking rate, and median household income. The protective factors for decreased risk of lung cancer diagnosis were female sex, younger age, lower county-level adult smoking rate, and higher county-level median household income."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "This study is the first to investigate the association between municipal smoke-free laws and lung cancer incidence. Individuals living in communities with comprehensive smoke-free laws were 7.9% less likely than those living in communities without smoke-free protections to be diagnosed with lung cancer. However, individuals living in communities with moderate or weak smoke-free laws were as likely as those in communities without such laws to be diagnosed with lung cancer. These findings suggest that comprehensive smoke-free laws are associated with fewer new cases of lung cancer, whereas weak or moderate smoke-free laws do not confer the same benefit. This disparity in health outcomes between communities with comprehensive smoke-free laws and those with weak or moderate laws has important implications for public health and for smoke-free policy development. Ensuring that smoke-free laws cover all workers without compromise (eg, exemptions for bars, gaming facilities) promotes health equity and improves population health outcomes. Findings from this study add to the growing evidence that comprehensive smoke-free laws promote population health 12, 37 and also reduce new cases of lung cancer. In addition to the presence of a comprehensive smoke-free law, other factors that protected a community from lung cancer diagnoses were lower county-level adult smoking rate and higher county-level median household income. Individual protective factors included female sex and younger age, consistent with lung cancer data in national samples. 1 "}, {"section_title": "Strengths and Limitations", "text": "The 20-year evaluation period provided adjusted rate estimates before and after law enactment (for all counties that passed laws), and the data analysis method temporally linked the county-level law status for each quarter to the corresponding lung cancer rate for the county. The 1995 starting point reflects the earliest date these data were collected by the KCR; this precedes the earliest smoke-free law in the state by 9 years. The primary study limitation is the potential for underestimating the full effect of a comprehensive smoke-free policy on lung cancer incidence. The latency period for lung cancer can be quite extended, and several of the comprehensive smoke-free policies included in this study had only been in effect for a limited time. Although counties with more recent laws were correctly coded as no law for the quarters before enactment, latency is a limitation, because it will likely be some time in the future before the full impact of those laws on lung cancer rates will be measurable in these communities. These results are considered preliminary; additional longitudinal studies are needed to assess the impact of smokefree laws on lung cancer incidence. In addition, we coded a county as having a smoke-free ordinance if the policy covered a city within the county; although a city is typically the population center in a county, this may have overestimated or underestimated the effect of a given ordinance. Another limitation is the retrospective nature of the current analysis, which restricted the study to the variables available in existing data sets."}, {"section_title": "Implications for Cancer Prevention and Control", "text": "The finding that comprehensive smoke-free laws are associated with fewer new cases of lung cancer, whereas weak and moderate laws are not, has significant implications for cancer prevention and control. Because the goal of a smoke-free policy is to protect workers and the public from the dangers of SHS and to reduce smokingattributable diseases like lung cancer, there is no room for compromise. Comprehensive smoke-free laws covering all workers and the public with few or no exceptions may be key in reducing new cases of lung cancer.\nTo date, 42% of the municipal governments with smoke-free ordinances in Kentucky have enacted weak or moderate laws. Although some believe that protecting certain groups is better than no smoke-free protections, our findings build on the growing evidence that this may not be the case, 12, 16 especially with regard to lung cancer incidence. Moreover, weak and moderate smoke-free laws are difficult to strengthen once they are enacted. 38 Therefore, weak and moderate smoke-free laws may actually deter efforts to reduce lung cancer. These findings have major implications for public health policy, suggesting that policymakers may not be able to compromise on smoke-free legislation without sacrificing the efficacy of these policies.\nFurther research is needed to better understand the relation between smoke-free laws and lung cancer incidence. Lung cancer takes significantly longer to develop than other smoking-related diseases, and smoke-free laws are relatively novel in Kentucky. Thus, as these laws become more established and have more time to impact adult smoking rates, 10 additional longitudinal studies will be vital to understand the impact of smoke-free public policies on lung cancer incidence."}, {"section_title": "FUNDING SUPPORT", "text": "No specific funding was disclosed."}]
