A large set of core data items is conveyed from year to year to enable trend comparisons. Each survey year, a different set of module questions on special topics of interest are included. For example, the 1995 SDR questionnaire had a postdoc module and the 1997 had special modules on alternative work arrangements, job security concerns, and recent doctorates' initial career experiences. No special module was introduced in the 1999 questionnaire except for the retention of a few recent doctorate module questions from 1997, such as first career path job and doctoral training experiences."}, {"section_title": "DATA COLLECTION", "text": "The 1999 SDR data collection consisted of two phases: a self-administered mail survey, followed by computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) of a sample of the nonrespondents to the mail survey. The mail survey consisted of an advance letter and the several waves of a personalized mailing package, with a reminder postcard between the first and second questionnaire mailing. The advance letter was sent in May 1999, followed by the first mailing a week later. The second mailing via USPS priority mail was sent in July 1999. The CATI follow-up of mail nonrespondents ended in February 2000."}, {"section_title": "RESPONSE RATES", "text": "The overall unweighted response rate for the 1999 SDR was 81.5 percent. The response to the mail phase of the survey was about 70 percent. The response rate to the CATI phase was about 43 percent. The overall 4 weighted response rate was about 82 percent (weighted response divided by the weighted sample cases)."}, {"section_title": "DATA PREPARATION", "text": "Data preparation for the 1999 SDR consisted of clerical, keying, and coding operations performed manually by the Census National Processing Center (NPC) and the computer operations performed by the Census Demographic Surveys Division (DSD). Data preparation began in May 1999 when the first mail questionnaires were returned to the NPC and continued through October 2000 when the DSD delivered the SESTAT formatted, edited, imputed data file to the NSF. As the mail questionnaires were received, they were checked into the tracking system. The mail-returned questionnaires that had one or more entries were clerically edited for data entry preparation. The clerical edit was limited to simple edits such as correcting illegible entries; rounding fractions to the closest whole number; verifying that city, state, and country entries were in the correct location. Clerically edited questionnaires were grouped into batches, keyed, and verified using the Key Entry III (KE III) system. The KE III system generated a keying report to track the status of cases through the keying operation. As part of quality control procedures, 5 percent verification was performed of all keyed questionnaires. For some questionnaire items (F9 Birthdate, F13/F14/ F16 Contact information), a 100 percent verification of questionnaire items was performed. NPC transmitted the keyed questionnaire data on a regular basis during the data collection phase to the DSD. DSD performed computer editing to identify cases with missing critical items (Al/A2 labor force status, A6/A21 job codes, F6 resident status in U.S., F9 birthdate) and generated Telephone Follow-up sheets. Telephone callbacks were made to obtain a response to these critical items; otherwise they were considered as incomplete responses. Whenever these callbacks were made, every attempt was made to obtain responses to other missing important data items (A7 FT/PT status, A15/A17 employment sector, A18/A19 type of educational institution, A26 job start date, A30/A31 work activities, and F14 future contact information). Since the DSD collected data in mail and CATI, the data sets were merged into one data set. The coding operation involved special coding of occupation and education codes, other specify coding, state and country coding and IPEDS coding. For special coding of occupation, the respondent's occupational data were reviewed along with other work-related data from the questionnaire by specially trained coders to \"correct\" known respondent self-reporting problems to obtain the \"best\" occupation codes. The education code for a newly earned degree was assigned strictly based on the degree field verbatim. The \"other specify\" responses were backcoded to existing response categories using the SESTAT other specify coding guidelines. Employer location (Al 1), Degreed school location (D6) and Country of citizenship (F8) were assigned the appropriate three-digit FIPS state/ country code. The Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System ( IPEDS) was used to assign codes for the employers (All) that are postsecondary institutions and for the newly earned degree school (D6). A detailed edit specification was developed from the SESTAT edit guidelines to perform further computer editing of multiple values to \"Mark One\" questions, skip errors, range errors, internal inconsistencies, cross-year inconsistencies. Basic frequency distributions of all survey items showed item nonresponse rates to be generally less than 3 percent. Nonresponse to a few questions deemed somewhat sensitive, such as household income, was around 6.2 percent. To compensate for item nonresponse, data not reported by the respondents as well as responses of \"refused\" or \"don't know\" were imputed. Imputation is a process for treating missing data. Imputation methods are used when answers to questions are blank or not usable. Two imputation methods were used: (1) logical imputation, and (2) hot deck imputation. For logical imputation, either the respondent's answers to related questions determined what the missing value had to be, or the respondent's answer to the same question in the prior survey round was substituted for the missing value. The latter approach of using the historical data is often called \"cold deck\" imputation. Cold deck imputation is useful for variables that are static, such as place of birth or gender. When logical imputation was used, it was employed before hot deck imputation. In hot deck imputation, a donor case is selected from the current round of respondents by matching related variables. The donor case's response is used as a proxy 5 for the recipient's missing variable. Hot deck imputation is the method of choice for variables that may change over time, such as employment characteristics. Hot deck is preferable to model-based imputation in this application because it easily preserves correlation among variables and maintains the valid response ranges for categorical variables."}, {"section_title": "WEIGHTING AND ESTIMATION", "text": "To enable weighted analyses of the 1999 SDR data, a sample weight was calculated for every person in the sample. The primary purpose of the weights is to create representative estimates by adjusting for unequal probabilities of selection. The second purpose is to adjust for the effects of nonresponse without increasing the variance. Informally, a sampling weight approximates the number of persons in the Ph.D. population that a sampled person represents. A main goal of this weighting plan is to produce final weights that reduce the nonresponse bias in our survey estimates, without increasing the variance. The weights were calculated in several stages. The first stage was the calculation ofbase weights that account for the sample design. A base weight is the inverse of the probability of selection in the SDR sample. For cases selected with certainty, the 1999 SDR base weight is equal to the 1999 SDR initial weight. For all other cases, the 1999 SDR base weight is greater than the initial weight. This increase reflects an adjustment for cases not selected for the sample. From the 1999 SDR base weights, the production of the 1999 SDR final weights involved four main steps: Adjustment for duplicate, frame ineligible, and never earned doctorate cases Calculation of the 1999 SDR control totals Calculation of the 1999 SDR noninterview weights Calculation of the 1999 SDR final weights Raking ratio adjustment was used to control the 1999 SDR sample back to the 1999 SDR population totals. The purpose of this adjustment is twofold: To decrease the sampling variability To account for changes in the final weights due to changes in the eligible sampling frame RELIABILITY Because the estimates produced from this survey are based on a sample, they may vary from those that would have been obtained if all members of the target population had been surveyed (using the same questionnaire and data collection methods). Two types of error are possible when population estimates are derived from any sample survey: sampling error and nonsampling error. By looking at these errors, it is possible to estimate the accuracy and precision of the survey results. Sampling error is the variation that occurs by chance because a sample, rather than the entire population, is surveyed. The particular sample that was used to estimate the 1999 population of science and engineering doctorates in the United States was one of a large number of samples that could have been selected using the same sample design and size. Estimates based on each of these samples would have differed. Thus, one should be particularly careful when interpreting results based on a relatively small number of cases or on small differences between the estimates. Due to the large amount of data collected in the SDR, it is not practical to directly calculate variance estimates for every survey estimate. Instead, generalized variance functions were developed to model the variance estimates for certain characteristics. Parameters derived from these generalized variance functions approximate variance estimates for all survey items. As a result, these sampling errors provide an indication of the order of magnitude of a sampling error rather than a precise sampling error for -any specific item. The variances on the survey estimates were calculated by the successive difference replication method. This replication method was used to first calculate a small number of variance estimates, which were then used to estimate the parameters of the generalized variance function. An one-parameter model was used to calculate the generalized variance parameters which were estimated using an iterative weighted least square procedure. Since many of the SDR estimates of interest consist of small populations such as estimates of Hispanic sciences or black engineers, the finite population correction factor was consistently applied to all the variance estimates. Different generalized variance functions were used to estimate standard errors associated with a broader 6 range of totals and percentages. The a and b parameters were calculated for each of the demographic groups and fields of study shown in Appendix C. The a and b parameters can be used to approximate standard errors for the S&E doctoral population overall, for broad field groupings used by NSF, and for selected subgroups of analytic interest."}, {"section_title": "STANDARD ERROR OF ESTIMATED NUMBERS", "text": "To calculate the desired standard errors on numbers, let X denote the estimated number. The standard error can be approximated using the appropriate values of a and b along with the following formula for standard errors of totals: SE(X) = [0112 + bX] (1) When calculating standard errors for numbers from tabulations involving different characteristics, use the set of parameters for the characteristic which will give the largest standard error."}, {"section_title": "Illustration", "text": "Suppose an estimated 2,770 females with a doctorate in the biological sciences were reported as working in the Federal Government in 1999.

Since this interval does not include zero, we can conclude with 95% confidence that the estimated number of male life sciences doctoral recipients is significantly higher than the number of female life sciences doctoral recipients. However, if there is a high positive (negative) correlation between the two characteristics, the formula will overestimate (underestimate) the true standard error. In addition to sampling error, data are subject to nonsampling error, which can arise at many points in the survey process. Sources of nonsampling error take many different forms: (1) nonresponse bias, which arises when the characteristics of individuals who do not respond to a survey differ significantly from those who do; (2) measurement error, which arises when we are not able to precisely measure the variables of interest; (3) coverage error, which arises when some members of the target population are not identified and thus do not have a chance to be selected for the sample; and (4) processing error, which can arise at the point of data editing, coding or key entry. These sources of error are much harder to estimate than sampling errors."}, {"section_title": "IMPORTANT NOTES ON THE TABLES", "text": "The following definitions are provided to help facilitate the use of data in the detailed tables.

Occupation data were derived from responses to several questions on the type of work primarily performed by the respondent. The occupational classification of the respondent was based on his/her principal job held during the reference weekor last job held, if not employed in the reference week (questions A20 or A5). Also used in the occupational classification was a respondent-selected job code (questions A21 or A6).

Employer location was based primarily on responses to question All on the location of the principal employer. Individuals not reporting place of employment were classified by their last mailing address. Primary work activity was determined from responses to question A30. \"Development\" includes the development of equipment, products, and systems. \"Design\" includes the design of equipment, processes, and models.

Citizenship status category of non-U.S., temporary resident does not include individuals who, at the time they received their doctorate, expressed plans to leave the United States. These individuals were excluded from the sampling frame. Salary data were derived from responses to question A34, in which information was requested regarding annual salary before deductions for the principal job held during April 1999, excluding income from bonuses, overtime, and summer teaching/research. Salaries reported are median annual salaries, rounded to the nearest $100 and computed for full-time employed sciences and engineers.

Involuntary-out-of field rate is the percent of employed individuals who reported they were working part-time exclusively because suitable full-time work was not available and/or working in an area not related to the first doctoral degree (in their principal job) at least partially because suitable work in the field was not available.\nNational Science Foundation/Division of Science Resources Statistics, 1999 Survey of Doctorate Recipients       \nNational Science Foundation/Division of Science Resources Statistics, 1999 Survey of Doctorate Recipients 23 2: 7  Social sciences  74,300  52,030  22,270  62,590  44,050  18,530  3,080  1,990  1,100  Economics  21,190  17,690  3,500  17,270  14,560  2,710  600  510  90  Political and related sciences  16,090  12,500  3,590  13,940  10,970  2,970  860  580  270  Sociology  13,420  8,010  5,410  11,570  6,930  4,640  660  410  250  Other social sciences  23,590  13,830  9,760  19,810  11,600  8,210  970  480  490   Psychology  84,300  45,770  38,530  76,550  42,600  33,950  2,770   1,060  1,710   Engineering  95,890  89,510  6,380  62,650  58,570  4,070  1,520  1,380  140  Aerospace /aeronautical engineering  4,360  4,210  150  3,340  3,250  90  70  70   S   Chemical engineering  12,520  11,570  950  8, \nNational Science Foundation/Division of Science Resources Statistics, 1999 Survey of Doctorate Recipients  Social sciences  74,300  67,600  61,290  6,320  6,700  5,480  1,220   Economics  21,190  18,140  15,970  2,170  3,050  2,320  730   Political and related sciences  16,090  15,170  13,590  1,580  920  790   130   Sociology  13,420  12,780  11,950  830  640  590  50  Other social sciences  23,590  21,510  19,770  1,730  2,090  1,780  310   Psychology  84,300  82,450  78,850  3,600  1,850  1,490  360   Engineering  95,890  76,430  54,370  22,060  19,460  14,510  4,950  Aerospace/aeronautical engineering  4,360  3,720  2,910  810  640  410  230   Chemical engineering  12,520  10,420  7,610  2,810  2,110  1,430  670  Civil engineering  8,700  7,130  4,490  2,640  1,570  1,130  440  ElectricaVcomputer engineering  25,980  20,100  13,820  6,280  5,880  4,370   1,510   Materials/metallurgical engineering  9,970  7,850  5,960  1,890  2,120   1,520  590   Mechanical engineering  12,780  9,480  6,430  3,050  3,300  2,580   720   Other engineering  21,580  17,740  13,160  4,580  3,840  3,050  790 See explanatory information and SOURCE at end of table.\nNational Science Foundation/Division of Science Resources Statistics, 1999 Survey of Doctorate Recipients  3,090  3,110  2,380  2,180  2,240  2,950  Physics and astronomy  38,560  6,910  5,580  4,900  4,160  5,110  11,900   Social sciences  74,300  14,230  10,460  10,850  11,600  12,210  14,950   Economics  21,190  3,570  2,840  3,320  3,020  3,510  4,950  Political and related sciences   16,090  3,500  2,290  1,980  1,920  2,740  3,670  Sociology   13,420  2,300  1,640  1,970  2,520  2,480  2,510   Other social sciences  23,590  4,870  3,690  3,580  4,150  3,480  3,830   Psychology  84,300  15,120  15,050  14,060  14,020  11,780  14,250   Engineering  95,890  24,820  18,450  12,530  9,420  10,300  20,370  Aerospace/aeronautical engineering  4,360  1,180  570  490  240  440  1,450   Chemical engineering   12,520  2,610  2,340  2,120  1,040  1,470  2,950   Civil engineering   8,700  1,890  1,720  1,240  660  980  2,210  ElectricaVcomputer engineering  25,980  7,500  5,030  3,020  2,240  2,530  5,660   Materials/metallurgical engineering  9,970  3,060  2,180  1,120  1,230  930  1,450   Mechanical engineering   12,780  3,750  2,600  1,910  1,090  1,300  2,140   Other engineering  21,580  4,840  4,010  2,630  2,910  2,680  4,510  See explanatory information and SOURCE at end of table. 32 3 6 KEY: S=Suppressed due to too few cases (fewer than 50 weighted cases).\nNational Science Foundation/Division of Science Resources Statistics, 1999 Survey of Doctorate Recipients S=Suppressed due to too few cases (fewer than 50 weighted cases).\nNational Science Foundation/Division of Science Resources Statistics, 1999 Survey of Doctorate Recipients   ''All other faculty includes adjunct or other faculty.
