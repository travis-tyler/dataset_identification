[{"section_title": "", "text": "data are \"at risk\", with no long-term viable economic model in place to ensure continuing access and preservation for the community. An in-depth study of the economics of digital preservation ( [5] , [6] ) explored the complex issues of supporting valued data for the public good, but ultimately there is no economic \"magic bullet\" that doesn't require someone, somewhere to pay.\nWhat happens to valuable data when project funding ends? Consider for example, a 3 year research project in which valuable sensor data are collected from an environmentally sensitive area. Those data may be useful not just for the duration of the project, but for the next decade or more to collaborators and a broader community of researchers. For the first 3 years, the costs of stewardship (including development of a database that supports analysis, access to the data for the community through a portal, adequate storage and management of the data collection, and so on) may be paid for by the grant. But who pays for subsequent support? In such cases, research data may become more valuable just as the economics of stewardship become less viable.\nUp to this point, no one sector has stepped up to take on the problem alone and it is unrealistic to expect as much:\n\u2022 In the public sector, federal R&D agencies are unlikely to allocate enough resources to support all federally funded research data. The costs of infrastructure would absorb too great a portion of a budget that must support both innovation as well as the infrastructure needed to drive innovation.\n\u2022 The private sector, especially in information technology, has tremendous capacity and expertise to support the stewardship of public access research data; however, there are few explicit incentives to take this on. In early 2008, Google announced that it would begin to support open source scientific data sets. By the end of the year, the project was shut down for business reasons [7] . Without explicit incentives and credits, it is challenging for companies to step forward and partner productively to support the common good.\n\u2022 In the academic sector, university libraries are natural foci for the stewardship of digital research data. But they need financial support to evolve in this direction at a time when many budgets are being cut.\nThe key is not to look to a particular sector alone, but to develop much stronger partnerships among sectors. Such a division of labor can provide a framework of options that distribute the burdens and benefits of stewardship and economic support. This is a growing trend internationally where initiatives such as the Vector Ecology and Control Network [8] (VECNet) are combining private funding (The Gates Foundation and others), public funding (the Australian National Data Service and others), and academic sponsorship (Oxford, the University of Pittsburgh, James Cook University and others) with the goal of building tools to analyze malaria transmission and reduce its spread by vector control interventions. The recent emergence of the community-driven Research Data Alliance [9] is also capitalizing on cross-sector and trans-national solutions to build the social, organizational and technical infrastructure needed to accelerate open access research data sharing and exchange.\nWithin the U.S., the public access for research data stewardship problem could begin to be addressed through 4 coordinated approaches:"}, {"section_title": "Facilitate private sector stewardship of public access research data", "text": "With sufficient public incentives including tax credits and other means, federal and state governments could make it attractive for the private sector to host, preserve, and serve up public access research data. Support for the public good is not new to the private sector. Private companies frequently sponsor the arts and social causes, often leveraging advantageous economic models that promote support for the public good. Why not utilize the same approaches to provide stewardship for public access research data, itself a quasi-public good? Note that it will be important for federal and state incentives to incorporate a commitment to smooth transition for research data collections when companies choose to move their investments elsewhere. Moreover, adequate safeguards need to be in place to avoid private sector control of access and use [10] , [11] ."}, {"section_title": "Use public sector investment to jumpstart sustainable stewardship solutions in other sectors", "text": "The success of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) [12] demonstrates that public-private partnerships can accelerate research discovery through data sharing and collaboration. Public partnership with the academic sector can help provide access and stewardship options as well. At present, many progressive university libraries such as the Johns Hopkins' Sheridan Libraries [13] are proactively seeking to address community needs for digital research data stewardship. With an initial public or private \"ramp-up\" investment in library capacity and workforce (perhaps through something analogous to the federal government's SBIR/STTR program), and the expectation that universities will work with their libraries to create sustainable economic models when ramp-up funding is over, libraries can begin to curate and provide access to some of the data that researchers are generating."}, {"section_title": "Create and clarify public sector stewardship commitments for public access research data.", "text": "There is ample precedent for the government to support certain data collections of great community value, such as the Protein Data Bank. However, with thousands of grants per year and data sets ranging from megabytes or less to terabytes or more, not all federally funded data can be realistically hosted within a public repository. In light of this, clarification about which collections would be supported by the public sector, for how long, and under what circumstances would be tremendously helpful to the research community. Knowing what won't be hosted within public repositories could help drive new stewardship efforts in other sectors as well."}, {"section_title": "Encourage research culture change to take advantage of what works in the private sector.", "text": "Finally, researchers, like the general public, subscribe to digital versions of newspapers, donate to Wikipedia, pay for and download iTunes, buy data services on-line, etc. In other words, researchers pay for many kinds of digital data. Yet there is widespread expectation that access to research data should be supported by the Government or academic institutions and be free to the research community. As community infrastructure becomes increasingly fundamental for data-driven research, the research community could begin to use economic models that are effective elsewhere. Imagine supporting the National Virtual Observatory (astronomy data) from telescope advertisements, or paying a small download fee for data from digital marine collections in the same way we download music from the internet. Such economic models will not solve the whole problem, but could help provide some infrastructure support necessary for access and preservation of research data. (The possibility of charging for the commercial use of databases as data tools under the take-and-pay rule was suggested in [10] ).\nPublic access presupposes that the research data supported by public funding will be available when it is sought. Such availability is dependent on the existence of effective data infrastructure, i.e. to access data, it must be hosted somewhere, and someone must fund the human and technological infrastructure that hosts the data. Without viable economic models for this infrastructure, valuable research data may disappear, making it accessible to no-one and deterring us from making the most of our research investments.
