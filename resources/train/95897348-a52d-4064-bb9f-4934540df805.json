[{"section_title": "", "text": "surveyed in the spring term of their sophomore year and then again 2 years later in the spring, when most of them were seniors. For analysis of dropouts from the most recent period, ELS:2002 serves as the data source. ELS:2002 is a survey of high school students and their parents, teachers, and school administrators that began with a nationally representative group of 10 th -graders in 2002 and included follow-ups in later years. Sophomores from 2002 and their status in 2004 are studied in this report. For cross-cohort analysis, HS&B and NELS:88 are used along with ELS:2002. HS&B began in 1980 with a survey of both sophomores and seniors and followed them up in later years. Information from the HS&B base-year sophomore cohort (1980) and first follow-up (1982) is used for the current report. NELS:88 began with 8 th -graders in 1988 and included follow-ups in later years as well. The original sample of 8 th -graders was augmented with additional sample members in 1990 to obtain a fully representative sample of 10 th -graders for that year, as some 10 th -graders may not have been in 8 th grade or otherwise available to sample 2 years previously (e.g., 9 th -graders in 1988 who were subsequently retained in the 9 th or 10 th grades and thus were 10 th -graders 2 years later when the NELS 8 th -grade cohort reached the 10 th grade, or 8 th -graders who were out of the country but returned and were 10 th -graders in 1990). The 10 th -grade cohort and the 1992 follow-up of NELS:88 were used for this analysis. Dropouts in this report are defined as sophomores who left school (and remained out of school) without receiving a regular diploma or earning a GED or equivalency credential by the spring 2 years later. Students who graduated from high school with regular or honors diplomas are called graduates, while graduates and those leaving high school with a GED or equivalency credential (including a certificate of attendance) are collectively called completers. All estimates have been weighted to represent the population of high school sophomores in each cohort, and the estimated standard errors account for the complex survey designs of these studies. All comparisons reported in the text, unless explicitly noted, have met the criterion of statistical significance using a two-tailed Student's t test with an alpha level of 0.05.

This analysis is based on a time frame of up to 2 years after typical high school completion. High school completion for the ELS:2002 sophomore cohort was measured based on high school transcripts, which provide information about high school coursetaking and completion through summer 2004, and on the 2006 second follow-up, which provides information about high school enrollment and completion status as of 2006. This analysis found the following: \u2022 Of those sophomores from 2002 who had been classified as dropouts in the spring term of 2004, twenty-seven percent were dropouts in 2006. Seventy-three percent would not be considered dropouts in 2006, a percentage that includes 38 percent who had earned a diploma or equivalency credential and an additional 35 percent who reported that they were working towards a diploma or equivalency credential. to drop out did so, compared to 2 percent of those whose math teachers thought they would get a bachelor's degree. \u2022 Math and English teachers were more accurate in predicting who would drop out than students themselves were. For expectations of completing high school or some college, smaller percentages of students were dropouts whose math and English teachers expected them to complete these levels than of students who themselves expected to attain those levels. For example, among students whose math teachers expected them to attain some college education (short of a bachelor's degree), 6 percent were dropouts. Among students who themselves expected to attain only some college education, 12 percent were dropouts 2 years later. \u2022 Four percent of sophomores whose math and English teachers agreed that the sophomore related well with others in class dropped out, compared to 18 percent of students where both the math and English teacher thought the student did not relate well to others. \u2022 Sophomores whom both teachers identified as attentive in class \"most of the time\" or \"all of the time\" had lower dropout rates than sophomores whom one or neither teacher identified as attentive (2 percent compared to 9 and 17 percent, respectively)."}, {"section_title": "Achievement", "text": "\u2022 Sophomores were given an exam (created specifically for ELS:2002) that assessed their reading and mathematics abilities.

The decline in dropout rates among males and females did not differ significantly from overall declines. Males had a higher dropout rate in both 1982 and 2004 than females did. \u2022 In 1982, Black sophomores had a higher dropout rate (14 percent) than Asian/Pacific Islander (2 percent) and White (10 percent) sophomores. The pattern was the same in 2004: Black sophomores had a higher dropout rate (10 percent) than Asian/Pacific Islander (3 percent) and White (5 percent) sophomores. \u2022 In 2004, Whites remained the largest proportion of dropouts at 44 percent, though they were no longer the majority as they were in 1992 (57 percent) and 1982 (67 percent). \u2022 For those sophomores coming to class prepared (based on saying they \"never\" or \"rarely\" attended class without paper/pencil or books), dropout rates were lower in 1992 and 2004 (6 percent each) than in 1982 (8 percent). Dropout rates also declined for sophomores coming to class unprepared: for example, the rate was 9 percent in 2004 and 19 percent in 1982 for those saying they \"often\" or \"sometimes\" came to class without books. \u2022 Dropout rates for students with less than 10 credits by the end of 10 th grade were higher than for those with 10 or more credits earned by the end of 10 th grade, in all cohorts. For example, in 2004, fifty-five percent of students who had earned 5-10 credits dropped out, compared to 4 percent of those who had earned at least 10 credits. The dropout rate for students with 5-10 credits increased from 21 percent in 1992 to 55 percent in 2004. \u2022 Dropouts scored lower than non-dropouts on the mathematics assessment in all three cohorts, but the sophomore math test scores of dropouts were higher in 2004 than in 1982 (29 versus 24, respectively, with the range of possible scores 0 to 58). Nondropout sophomore math test scores were higher in 2004 (38) than in 1982 (34).

Introduction", "text": "This report presents detailed information about selected characteristics and experiences of late high school dropouts in 2004 and comparative data about late dropouts in 1982, 1992, and 2004. It is important to emphasize that the current findings address only dropping out in late high school and do not cover students who dropped out before the spring of 10 th grade. For this reason, rates reported here will be lower than those based on the students' entire high school or earlier school career. In addition, because the dropout rate used in this report does not count alternative completers (e.g., recipients of the General Educational Development [GED] credential) as dropouts, this rate should not necessarily be interpreted as the inverse of an overall graduation rate. Dropping out of high school is a major life event that severely impacts students' chances for subsequent educational and occupational opportunities (Catterall 1985;Natriello 1986;Rumberger 1987;Weis, Farrar, and Petrie 1989). Even if dropouts obtain an equivalency credential, their ability to benefit from additional postsecondary options may be limited (Cameron and Heckman 1993;Heckman and Rubinstein 2001;Boesel, Alsalam, and Smith 1998), though this may be true for some students more than others (Murnane, Willett, and Boudett 1997;Tyler, Murnane, and Willett 2000). If dropouts come back to high school to finish their diploma, the interruption of their education and career advancement may still affect their adult lives for some time (e.g., Grossman and Kaestner 1997). This report provides information on selected characteristics of dropouts and differences in the dropout population over time that may be useful for addressing high dropout rates and the negative consequences of dropping out. The report is provided with the caution that the relationships between student characteristics and dropping out are purely correlational and do not indicate causality. This report is descriptive in nature, and the results are from bivariate comparisons that test for differences between groups defined by student characteristics and dropout status. Complex interactions and relationships have not been explored, and relationships among the student variables may exist that have implications for understanding dropping out. Release of this descriptive report is intended to encourage more in-depth analyses of the relationship between these variables using more sophisticated statistical methods."}, {"section_title": "Defining Dropouts and the Dropout Rate", "text": "A number of concerns have been raised in recent years about the definition and enumeration of dropouts and graduates nationwide (Greene, Winters, and Swanson 2006; National Institute of Statistical Sciences (NISS)/Education Statistics Services Institute (ESSI) 2004; Seastrom et al. 2006aSeastrom et al. , 2006bSwanson and Chaplin 2003;Warren and Halpern-Manners 2007). States and localities have varying ways of monitoring the educational progress of their students, including different ways of counting who is a dropout. (For example, GED recipients or other alternative completers such as certificate of attendance holders are sometimes considered dropouts, completers, or graduates.) National sources of information also have different definitions and source data for detailing dropout patterns. These differences in populations and definitions can lead to differences in reported rates and thus to different conclusions about dropout patterns. For example, the U.S. Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) uses data from the U.S. Census Bureau's Current Population Survey (CPS, October supplement) to produce a \"status\" dropout measure for young adults. This dropout measure indicates the percentage of 16-to 24-year-olds in October of the survey year who have not completed high school and are not currently enrolled, regardless of when or even where (e.g., overseas) their education occurred. In contrast, NCES also publishes an \"event dropout rate\" using the CPS that measures the percentage of youth ages 15 through 24 in the United States who dropped out of grades 10-12 from either public or private schools in the 12 months between October of one year and the next (e.g., October 2004 to October 2005) (see Laird et al. 2007, appendix A-Technical Notes). A similar event dropout rate comes from NCES's Common Core of Data (CCD), a collection of data that comes from states and local school districts. These data measure the percentage of public high school students who were enrolled in the 9 th through 12 th grade at some time during the previous school year but were not enrolled at the beginning of the current school year and have not graduated from high school or completed a state or district approved program (Young 2003). These and other published dropout rates from NCES, the U.S. Census, or other sources do not match the current report's dropout rates in population base; definition of dropouts, including the grade levels from which the dropouts occurred; or relationship to graduation or completion rates. In addition, because dropouts are only measured over a 2-year period, and since some students remain in school or are working toward an equivalency credential and are therefore not dropouts, the dropout rates reported here should not be interpreted as the inverse of 4-year, on-time graduation rates. In the current report, late dropouts are defined as spring-term high school sophomores who have not earned a diploma or equivalency credential and are not enrolled in school during the spring term 2 years later, a time point when most sophomores would have been high school seniors. This longitudinal cohort rate is different from the dropout status measure and event dropout rates. The cohort definition is used because the longitudinal studies used in this report (see section 1.2, Sources of Data) are designed around spring-term data collections and share a 10 th -grade survey as a common component, enabling each of the groups of students to be followed over time to determine which students complete a diploma or equivalency credential within 2 years, which drop out, and which remain in school or are working on completion of an equivalency credential. This report is restricted to examining late high school dropping out and does not cover dropping out prior to the spring of 10 th grade. The potential effects of examining only late high school dropouts, and of using different data sources, can be observed by comparing the dropout rates reported in the current report with those published elsewhere. Figure 1 shows the late high school cohort dropout rate, as reported later in this text, as well as the CPS-based status dropout rate and the CPS-based event dropout rate, for the years 1982, 1992, and 2004. The status and event dropout rates (among other rates) are reported and explained by Laird et al. (2007).  -up, 1980-1982National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88), \"First and Second Follow-up, 1990Follow-up, -1992andEducation Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS:2002), \"Base Year and First Follow-up, 2002Follow-up, -2004.\" For status and event dropout rates: U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, Current Population Survey (CPS), October 1982October , 1992October , and 2004. Figure 1 shows two important facts. First, though the late high school cohort rates are lower than the status dropout rates, the cohort rates are higher than the event dropout rates, in all 3 years. Again, this reflects different features of the data and calculations used to create each rate. For example, the status dropout rate is based on a broad age range of youth (16-to 24-yearolds) who do not hold a high school diploma or equivalency credential in any given year; this rate includes youth who were educated outside of the United States, in contrast to the late high school cohort rate, which includes only U.S. high schoolers. Similarly, the event dropout rate considers only dropouts from one year to the next, in contrast to the 2-year time span involved in the late high school cohort rate. Second, the three rates show a similar set of intercohort differences. In each case, dropout rates declined between 1982 and 1992 but did not show any statistically significant difference between 1992 and 2004. The cohort and status rates show a decrease in the dropout rate when 1982 is compared to 2004, though the same comparison for the event dropout rate is not statistically significant. Both the similar cross-time results and the cross-rate comparisons support the conclusion that the late high school cohort rates used in this report are within the mainstream of current and historical dropout rates. (More information about the data and methods behind the late high school cohort rate are provided below and in appendix A.) The late high school cohort rate can also be placed in the context of other cohort studies that include earlier-grade dropouts. The National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88) began in the spring term of the 8 th grade-two grades earlier than its successor study, the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002(ELS:2002. While earlier-grade dropout rates may conceivably have changed in the intervening years, NELS:88 findings suggest possible limitations of an approach that only shows factors related to the likelihood of dropping out in the last 2 years of high school. In NELS:88, the spring cohort dropout rate in the 2 years following 8 th grade was 6.8 percent (McMillen and Kaufman 1996); as reported in figure 1, in the 2 years following 10 th grade, it was 6.2 percent. There are, then, substantial numbers of both early (grades 8-10) and late (grades 10-12) dropouts (the cumulative spring cohort dropout rate was 11.6 percent between grades 8 and 12 and 11.0 percent between spring of grade 8 and the end of summer after grade 12) (McMillen and . Analysis of NELS:88 data suggests that, while there are strong commonalities between the two groups (Stearns et al. 2007), there are also differences, such that conclusions reached about late dropouts may not fully apply to early dropouts and would qualify the portrait of the dropout population as a whole (Stearns and Glennie 2006). Goldschmidt and Wang (1999) found that the mix of student risk factors changes between early and late dropouts (in particular, family characteristics are more important for late dropouts). Still, echoing Rumberger (1995) and Jimerson, Anderson, and Whipple (2002), Goldschmidt and Wang found that being held back is the single strongest predictor of dropping out among their analysis sample and that its effect is consistent for both early and late dropouts. While the effect of excluding pre-sophomore dropouts from the analysis cannot be studied with the most recent data, some of the implications of using the spring term instead of the fall after typical graduation as the enrollment status time point can be analyzed using high school transcript and second follow-up information from the study. These issues are thus discussed using ELS:2002 after a brief overview of all three data sources used in the report."}, {"section_title": "Sources of Data", "text": "Three NCES studies serve as the foundation for the estimates presented in this report. Here, we describe basic information about the study and about the analysis samples used for this report; more information on each study and the variables used from each can be found in appendix A-Technical Notes and Glossary. For the most recent period of collected data, ELS:2002 provides information about sophomores in the spring of 2002 and dropout status 2 years later in the spring of 2004. ELS:2002 is a survey of high school students and their parents, teachers, and school administrators begun with a nationally representative group of 10 th -graders in the spring of 2002. It was repeated with a first follow-up in the spring of 2004 (including additional sample members to make a representative sample of 12 th -graders), transcript data collection soon thereafter, and a second follow-up in 2006, 2 years after most of the original sample members had graduated high school. The cross-cohort analysis presented in chapter 4 employs two other survey sources. The first is the High School and Beyond Longitudinal Study of 1980 Sophomores (HS&B-So:80/92). This cohort of HS&B began in 1980 with a survey of both 1980 sophomores and seniors, and followed up with them in 1982, 1984, and 1986, as well as 1992 for sophomores. The second is NELS:88, which began with 8 th -graders in 1988 and included follow-ups in 1990, 1992 (including a high school transcript collection), 1994, and 2000 (including a postsecondary transcript collection). The original sample of 8 th -graders was augmented (\"freshened\") with additional sample members in 1990 to obtain a fully representative sample of 10 th -graders for that year, as some 8 th -graders would have moved, fallen behind grades, or advanced extra grades. The 10 th -grade cohort was used as the baseline here as well. 1 The actual estimates for HS&B and NELS:88 are taken from an earlier NCES analysis, A Comparison of High School Dropout Rates in 1982 and1992  , for which this report serves as an update. Because of additional differences in the design and content of ELS:2002 as compared to HS&B and NELS:88, not all of the items from the previous report were deemed sufficiently consistent across years to include in the current report. Further discussion of this issue can be found in appendix A. All comparisons in this report are statistically significant; tests for statistical significance used Student's t statistic with a significance level of 0.05. Adjustments for multiple comparisons were not employed. See appendix A for more information."}, {"section_title": "Dropouts in 2004 and 2006", "text": "As noted, this report uses a definition of dropouts based on the student's status in the spring term of the typical student's senior year. This definition differs from a summer-inclusive definition of dropouts, in which students who earn a diploma or equivalency credential by August 30 are not counted as dropouts. When data are collected in the spring 2 years after the sophomore year, information about summer activities is not available. However, this section, using data from the ELS:2002 high school transcript data collection and the second follow-up with respondents conducted in 2006, explores differences in the two definitions and describes how spring-term dropouts fare within the next 2 years. Only this section of the report uses information about high school completion status up to 2 years after typical graduation (i.e., 4 years after sophomore year). In the rest of the report, dropouts are defined relative to the spring term 2 years after sophomore year. Table 1 presents separate breakdowns of enrollment or completion status for spring-term 2004 and for 2 years later in 2006. For the spring-term definition of dropping out (\"Spring 2004\" columns of table 1), survey respondents are classified as other than dropouts if they were in school (including those who were home schooled or alternative program participants) or completed school early (including those who were GED recipients). This category comprises a large majority of respondents: 93 percent (table 1). Respondents were classified as dropouts if they had not been in school for 4 consecutive weeks or more and were not absent due to accident or illness, or if they had been in school less than 2 weeks after a period in which they had missed school for 4 or more consecutive weeks not due to accident or illness. This group included the remainder of respondents: 7 percent (table 1). Two years later, transcript information and second follow-up responses were used in conjunction with earlier-round information 2 to place respondents into more refined categories (\"2006\" columns of table 1). Those who attained a diploma or equivalency credential are grouped into one of three categories: (1) a summer (i.e., August or earlier) 2004 or earlier graduate; (2) fall 2004 or later graduate (including graduates with unknown graduation dates, less than 1 percent of the sample); and (3) a GED or certificate of attendance recipient. Those who had not yet attained a diploma or equivalency are grouped into one of two categories: (1) a student still in school and/or claiming to be working towards a diploma or equivalency credential; and (2) a dropout. By 2006, approximately 5 percent of respondents were dropouts, a lower percentage than were identified as dropouts in the spring term of 2004. Table 1 shows enrollment and completion status by student subgroups. Both in the spring term of 2004 and in 2006, males had a higher dropout rate than females (7 versus 6 percent in 2004, and 5 versus 4 percent in 2006). Students classified as Black, Hispanic, or more than one race had higher dropout rates than their Asian/Pacific Islander or White peers in 2004 and in 2006. For example, the Hispanic dropout rate in the spring term of 2004 was 11 percent and in 2006 was 10 percent, compared to 5 percent (2004) and 3 percent (2006) for Whites. (American Indian rates are presented but not discussed due to unstable estimates; see appendix A.) Respondents who were in lower quarters of both the socioeconomic status distribution (SES, a composite of parental occupational status, parental education, and family income-see appendix A for more information) and 10 th -grade composite test score distribution had higher dropout rates both in the spring term of 2004 and in 2006 than those in higher quarters. 3 Figure 2 shows the cross-classification between these two status points (2004 and 2006). While most of those who were in school in 2004 received a diploma or equivalency by 2006, not all did, and some of those who were considered dropouts in 2004 did achieve this credential by 2006. Among those who had been defined as in-school or early completers during the spring term of 2004, ninety-three percent were later identified as graduates during or before the summer of 2004, with another 2 percent graduating in the fall of 2004 or later and 3 percent having earned a GED or certificate of attendance. One percent of the spring 2004 in-school students were working towards high school completion in 2006, while another 1.5 percent of spring 2004 students were dropouts in 2006. For those who had been classified as dropouts in the spring term of 2004, some 6 percent became graduates by the end of the summer of 2004, while another 4 percent were fall 2004 or later graduates (figure 2). Twenty-eight percent of the spring-term 2004 dropouts earned a certificate of attendance or GED by 2006, while 22 percent were still working towards their high school diploma in 2006. Still, 40 percent of the spring-term 2004 dropouts were dropouts 2 years later.

Chapter 3 examines items from a dropoutspecific questionnaire administered in 2004; these items provide additional information about what kinds of reasons students had for dropping out and what kinds of interventions they received from parents and school officials before dropping out. Finally, chapter 4 focuses on changes in dropout rates and overall student and dropout population distributions in 1980-82, 1990-92, and 2002-04.

Sophomore Characteristics and Experiences and High School Dropout Rates: 2004", "text": "This chapter uses data from the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002(ELS:2002 to examine dropout rates and the distribution of dropouts across specific characteristics 2 years after sophomore year. For comparison purposes, percentage distributions of the full sophomore cohort are also provided in the tables. Information about the student and the school come from the base-year wave of ELS:2002, collected when students were sophomores in the spring of 2002. Dropout status comes from the first follow-up of data collected in the spring of 2004. Early graduates or alternative completers (i.e., recipients of the General Educational Development [GED] credential) and those still attending school in the spring of 2004 are combined into one category, referred to here as \"students\" for ease of expression. Most 2002 sophomores (93 percent) were students or early completers in spring 2004 (table 1). Seven percent of the sophomores were dropouts at that time. The following discussion compares dropouts in terms of demographic and family background characteristics, characteristics of the schools they attended, educational expectations they have of themselves and expectations significant others have of them, classroom behavior, and academic achievement. The primary focus of this discussion is on dropout rates, with distributions of dropouts providing information about what characteristics are most common among dropouts. Further information about these distributions can be found in chapter 4, which presents changes over time and the overall sophomore class distributions for 2002. Table 2 reports individual characteristics of students and dropouts in 2004 by sex, race/ethnicity, age, and native language. Students reported this information about themselves in the base-year survey in 2002."}, {"section_title": "Demographic Characteristics", "text": "Males left school at a higher rate than females; 7 percent of males left school, compared to 6 percent of females. That translates into 56 percent of dropouts being male. Among racial/ethnic groups, Asian/Pacific Islander students had lower dropout rates (3 percent) than every other group. 4 Both Hispanic students and Black students left school at higher rates (11 percent and 10 percent, respectively) than did Asian/Pacific Islander and White students. Five percent of White spring 2002 sophomores were dropouts in the spring of 2004. Whites had lower dropout rates than Blacks, Hispanics, and students of more than one race, and higher dropout rates than Asian/Pacific Islander students. Whites still accounted for the plurality of all dropouts (44 percent), followed by Black and Hispanic sophomores at 21 and 27 percent, respectively. Dropout rates differed by the age of the respondent as well. Ages were calculated as of March 1, 2002, when the students were sophomores. Younger sophomores may have skipped a grade or started school as a child earlier than others, and older sophomores may have been held back or started school later. A plurality of sophomores (49 percent) were age 16, with 44 percent being 15 years old or younger and 7 percent being 17 years or older. Older students dropped out at higher rates than younger students: of those who were 15 years old or younger as sophomores, 3 percent were dropouts 2 years later, compared to a 7 percent dropout rate for 16-year-old sophomores (table 2). Of the students ages 17 or older as sophomores, 28 percent left school early. Among dropouts, 30 percent were ages 17 or older. Finally, those whose native language was English stayed in school at higher rates than those for whom English was a second language. Six percent of those whose native language was English were dropouts in spring 2004, compared to 10 percent of those for whom English was a second language. This dropout rate for nonnative English speakers is higher than the overall rate of 7 percent. Most dropouts (79 percent) were native English speakers. Table 3 shows dropout rates by various family characteristics: family composition, socioeconomic status (SES) quarter, parental education, and frequency of changing schools. Measures come from the parents' survey in 2002. Tenth-grade students who lived with both their mother and father were less likely to be school leavers 2 years later than those in every other family composition group. The dropout rate of students living with both their mother and father was 4 percent, compared to 9 percent for those with single parents, 10 percent for those living with their mother or father and a guardian, and 7 percent for those in other families. SES quarter is based on an index score of combined family income, parental education, and parental occupation measures; quarter refers to the location of the student on the weighted index score distribution (i.e., bottom 25 percent, middle 25-50 percent, middle 50-75 percent, or top 75 percent-see appendix A for more information). Sophomores in lower SES quarters had higher dropout rates: 12 percent of lowest SES quarter sophomores dropped out, compared to 6 and 2 percent of successively higher SES quarter groups. Fully 48 percent of all dropouts came from families in the lowest SES quarter, and 93 percent came from the bottom three-quarters of the SES distribution."}, {"section_title": "Family Characteristics", "text": "Parents' highest education level is the highest level reached by either parent (guardians not included). Sophomores whose parents had higher educational attainment stayed in school at higher rates than those whose parents had lower educational attainment (except for bachelor's versus advanced degree recipient categories). The dropout rates for those whose parents had a bachelor's degree (4 percent) or a graduate/professional degree (3 percent) were lower than the rates of those whose parents had some college education (6 percent) or a high school diploma or less (11 percent). Those whose parents had some college had lower dropout rates than those with a high school diploma or less. In addition, among dropouts, 47 percent had parents with only a high school degree or less, and 21 percent had parents with at least a bachelor's degree. Finally, we examine the relationship between changing schools and dropping out. Parents were asked (while their children were sophomores) the number of times the student had changed schools since first grade, excluding promotions from elementary school to middle school or from middle school to high school. Students may have changed schools for a variety of reasons: because of their parents' job, moving to live with a different parent or guardian, switching schools to find a more suitable academic or social environment, or external changes in school attendance boundaries. Table 3 shows that sophomores who changed schools more often dropped out at higher rates. For example, the dropout rate for those who never changed schools is 4 percent, compared to between 6 and 9 percent for those changing schools 2 to 5 or more times. Table 4 reports dropout rates for students by characteristics of the schools they attended in 10 th grade. The table shows the dropout rates and distribution of dropouts by school sector, the percentage of the student body that was minority, and the percentage of the student body that was eligible for free or reduced-price lunch. With respect to school sector, sophomores attending public schools dropped out in greater proportions than sophomores attending Catholic or other private schools: 7 percent of public school students were dropouts 2 years after their sophomore year, versus less than 1 percent of Catholic and 2 percent of other private school students. Though 92 percent of sophomores attended public schools, 98 percent of all dropouts attended public schools."}, {"section_title": "School Characteristics", "text": "Schools with a higher percentage of minority students had a higher dropout rate. The distribution of percent minority was divided into four equal-sized groups or quarters. From low to high, the quarters correspond to percent minority of 0-9 percent minority, 10-25 percent minority, 26-57 percent minority, and 58 percent or more minority. Those students attending schools in the top quarter of the distribution of percent minority had higher dropout rates than every other group (11 percent, compared to 7 percent of those in the second quarter, 5 percent in the third quarter, and 4 percent in the fourth quarter of percent minority schools). Students who subsequently dropped out attended the highest quarter of percent minority schools at a greater rate (40 percent) than they attended schools in other quarter groups. This is a higher rate than among all sophomores (25 percent). Next, dropout rates are reported by the percentage of students who were eligible for free or reduced-price lunch (FRPL). This measure serves as a proxy for the overall poverty level of the student body; schools are grouped into four equal-size categories based on the weighted distribution of the percentage of FRPL-eligible students: from low to high, the quarters generally correspond to 0-9 percent FRPL, 10-18 percent FRPL, 19-34 percent FRPL, and 34 percent or more FRPL. The dropout rate increased as the school poverty level increased. Sophomores attending the lowest quarter of percent FRPL schools had a lower dropout rate over the next 2 years than those in each of the less affluent schools. The dropout rate for those in the lowest quarter of percent FRPL schools was 4 percent, compared to 6 percent, 8 percent, and 11 percent for students attending schools with successively higher poverty levels. A greater percentage of dropouts (37 percent) attended the highest quarter of percent FRPL schools than any other single quarter."}, {"section_title": "Educational Expectations", "text": "The next section of this report examines the relationship between educational expectations and dropping out 2 years later. When students were in 10 th grade, they answered questions about how far they expected to go in school. In separate surveys, their parents and their 10 th -grade English and math teachers stated how far they expected the student would go in school. In each case, possible answers were coded into five categories: less than high school, high school, some college, bachelor's degree, and graduate or professional degree. At every level (except less than high school compared to high school diploma expectations), higher student educational expectation categories had lower dropout rates (table 5). Of sophomores who thought they would complete high school but not have postsecondary education, 21 percent dropped out, compared to 12 percent of those who planned to get some college, 4 percent of those who planned to get a bachelor's degree, and 2 percent of those who planned to attain a graduate or professional degree. Ninety-five percent of dropouts had expected as sophomores that they would get at least a high school diploma. This comparison is repeated for parental expectations. Almost all parents (99 percent) thought that their children would finish high school or higher. Of those whose parents thought their student would have no school beyond high school, 17 percent dropped out, compared to 13 percent of those whose parents thought they would have some college, 6 percent of those whose parents thought they would get a bachelor's degree, and 5 percent of those whose parents thought they would get a graduate or professional degree. As with student expectations, parental expectations for their sophomores were uniformly high even for sophomores who were dropouts 2 years later: 100 percent of dropouts' parents expected their sophomore to at least finish high school. Finally, the last two distributions of table 5 report dropout rates based on the expectations of student's 10 th -grade English and math teachers. One 10 th -grade English and one 10 th -grade math teacher of each student responded to a questionnaire. Thirty-four percent of those whose 10 th -grade English teacher expected them to drop out did leave school, while 2 percent of those whose English teacher thought they would get a bachelor's degree left school. Similarly, 32 percent of those whose 10 th -grade math teacher expected them to drop out were dropouts 2 years later, compared to 2 percent of those whose math teacher thought they would get a bachelor's degree. Thus, teachers were somewhat more accurate in predicting high school dropout than were students themselves. Among sophomores whose math teachers expected the student to not complete high school, 32 percent actually dropped out. Among English sophomores whose English teachers expected the student to not complete high school, 34 percent actually dropped out. Among students who themselves expected to not finish high school, 30 percent dropped out.  Table 6 examines teacher ratings of students' behavior. One 10 th -grade English and one 10 th -grade math teacher of each student answered questions about whether the student relates well with others, is excessively passive or withdrawn, or talks with the teacher outside of class. Results show dropout status based on whether both teachers agreed with each statement, only one teacher agreed, or both disagreed. In addition, teachers were asked how often the student was attentive or disruptive in class; these responses were coded in terms of one or both teachers saying the student was attentive most or all of the time or was never/rarely disruptive (to keep the variables in a uniform direction for comparisons). Where both teachers agreed that the sophomore related well with others in class, the dropout rate was 4 percent, compared to 18 percent of students where both teachers thought the student did not relate well to others and 11 percent where only one teacher thought so. Likewise, a higher percentage of sophomores (13 percent) whom both teachers identified as passive or withdrawn in class were spring 2004 dropouts than sophomores whom one or neither teacher identified as such (9 and 5 percent dropping out, respectively). In terms of talking to the math or English teacher outside of class (these conversations could pertain to school work, the student's aspirations, or other personal matters), the finding is similar: sophomores who talked to at least one of the two teachers outside of class dropped out at a lower rate (5 percent) than those who did not talk with either of these teachers outside of class (7 percent dropping out). Further, both teachers reported that students did not talk to them outside of class for 43 percent of all sophomores and for 54 percent of dropouts (table 6)."}, {"section_title": "Teacher Perceptions of Student Behavior", "text": "Regarding the frequency of attentiveness and disruptiveness, sophomores whom both teachers identified as attentive in class \"most of the time\" or \"all of the time\" had a lower dropout rate than those whom one or neither teacher identified as such (2 percent compared to 9 and 17 percent, respectively). In addition, while 13 percent of sophomores had both teachers reporting that they were never or rarely attentive in class, 37 percent of eventual dropouts had such a report from both teachers surveyed (table 6). Finally, when both teachers thought the student was disruptive, 14 percent were dropouts 2 years later, compared to 9 percent when only one teacher thought the student was disruptive and 5 percent when neither teacher said the student was disruptive most or all of the time. Sixteen percent of dropouts had both teachers reporting problems with disruptiveness, compared to 7 percent among all sophomores."}, {"section_title": "Academic Preparedness", "text": "This section focuses on indicators of the students' academic preparedness. All measures come from the 2002 data collection, when the students were in 10 th grade. Measures include academic preparation and academic engagement, each based on multiple variables as reported by the student; weekly hours of homework the student reported; and parental reports of the number of grades the student had repeated, whether the student had a disability, and whether the student had behavior problems at school. Table 7 first shows categories of academic preparation and academic engagement, ordered from low to high. The academic preparation measure is a summary of student responses to questions about their preparation for class, specifically how often he or she went to class without pencil or paper, without books, or without completed homework. The academic engagement measure summed student responses to questions about behavior and attitudes in school. Specifically, the student stated how often he or she was tardy, cut class, or was absent in the first semester of that school year, and answered a question about whether or not classes are interesting and challenging. For both measures, sums at or below the 25 th percentile distribution point were categorized as low, 25 th to the 74 th percentile scores were categorized as middle, and scores at or above the 75 th percentile were categorized as high. See appendix A for more information. Sophomores in the lower categories of academic preparation and engagement were spring 2004 dropouts at higher rates than sophomores in higher categories. Nine percent of sophomores in the low preparation category were dropouts in the spring of 2004, compared to 6 and 4 percent in the middle and high preparation category, respectively. Similarly, 12 percent of sophomores in the low engagement category were spring 2004 dropouts, versus 4 and 3 percent in the middle and high preparation category, respectively. In both the case of preparation and engagement, a majority of dropouts (58 and 62 percent, respectively) had low scores on the indices for preparation or engagement while sophomores. In terms of time spent on homework, those who reported doing no homework or 1-2 hours of homework each week were dropouts 2 years later in greater proportions than those who reported doing more homework. The dropout rate was 12 percent for those reporting 0 hours of homework and 8 percent for those reporting 1-2 hours per week, compared to 6 percent for those doing 3-5 hours each week and 3 percent each for 6-10 or 11 or more hours per week. 1 Academic preparation categorization is based on the 25th and 75th percentiles of an index measure. The index was based on the summed responses to three variables: How often student goes to class without pencil or paper, without books, and without homework done. Each measure had four response options of never, seldom, often, and usually, and numerical values going from 4 to 1, respectively (reverse coded). Range of this summed variable is 3-12, with low category being values of 3-9, middle being 10, and high being 11-12. See appendix A, section A.5.3, for more information. 2 Academic engagement categorization is based on the 25th and 75th percentiles of an index measure. The index was based on the summed responses to four variables: During the first semester or term of 10th grade, how often student was tardy, cuts class, is absent; and agreement or disagreement with statement that classes are interesting and challenging. For \"how often\" variables, response options were \"never,\" 1-2 times, 3-6 times, 7-9 times, and 10 or more times; for statement of agreement variable, responses were \"strongly disagree,\" \"disagree,\" \"agree,\" and \"strongly disagree.\" Numerical values were assigned from 4 to 1 (reverse coded) for \"how often\" variables and 1 to 5 for statement of agreement variable. Range of this summed variable is 4-19, with low category being values of 4-13, middle being 14-15, and high being 16-19. See appendix A, section A.5.3, for more information. 3 Reflects hours of homework done out of school. Dropout rates also differed by the number of grades repeated. The dropout rate for sophomore cohort members was 4 percent for those who had not repeated a grade, compared to 17 percent for those who repeated one grade and 29 percent for those who had repeated two or more grades. Nevertheless, 60 percent of dropouts had not repeated a grade, and 5 percent of dropouts had repeated two or more grades (compared to less than 1 percent of all sophomores who repeated two or more grades). Prior studies have reported on the high school completion rates of students with disabilities (U.S. Department of Education 2005). In ELS:2002, parents reported whether the sophomore had a \"physical, emotional, or learning disability.\" Among sophomores reported by their parents as having a disability, 10 percent left school, compared to 5 percent of those reported as having no disability. Twenty-three percent of dropouts had a parent-reported disability. A higher dropout rate was observed for sophomores whose parents reported the student as having a behavior problem at school. Seventeen percent of those whose parents thought they had a behavior problem in 2002 were dropouts in spring 2004, compared to 4 percent of those whose parents did not perceive a behavior problem. Twenty-five percent of dropouts had a parent-perceived behavior problem at school."}, {"section_title": "Academic Achievement", "text": "Overall, sophomores entered 10 th grade with a 9 th -grade grade point average (GPA, based on transcripts) of 2.6. Among dropouts, however, the average 9 th -grade GPA was 1.6, or below a C. Table 8 reports additional factors related to the academic achievement of high school dropouts in 2002. In this table, academic achievement is indicated by the following measures: 10 th -grade scores on the composite, math, and reading tests, and the number of credits earned by the end of 10 th grade (categorized). 5 The first three variables show dropout rates by quarters of the composite achievement (reading plus math) test, the math test, and the reading test. For each test, those in higher test score quarters stayed in school at higher rates than those in lower test score quarters. For example, 13 percent of sophomores in the lowest composite test quarter were dropouts in spring 2004, compared to 6 percent of those in the middle two quarters and 1 percent of those in the top test quarter. Five percent of 2004 dropouts had scored in the highest quarter of the composite or math tests in 2002, and 7 percent scored in the highest quarter of the reading test.  ,\" \"First Follow-up, 2004,\" and \"High School Transcript Study, 2004.\" The number of credits earned is shown last (table 8). Those with 10 or more credits stayed in school at higher rates than those with less than 10 credits: the dropout rate for those with 10 or more credits was 4 percent, compared to 55 percent of those with 5-10 credits and 53 percent of those with fewer than 5 credits. While 96.5 percent of all sophomores obtained 10 or more credits by the end of their sophomore year, 69 percent of dropouts had done so, indicating that 31 percent of eventual dropouts had been behind in their credit accrual before the last 2 years of high school. See chapter 4 and the cross-cohort analysis for information on how these credit counts have changed over time.\nTables 21 through 23 present categorical academic achievement information for all sophomores, associated dropout rates by level of achievement, and the percentage distribution of dropouts across achievement categories. Table 24 presents additional achievement information for dropouts and non-dropouts using continuous factors such as an equated mathematics test score, credits earned in the 2 years prior to the end of 10 th grade, and grade point average in courses in the 2 years prior to the end of 10 th grade. 9 Tables 21 through 23 focus on the quarter of the sophomore math test distribution in which the student scored and a categorization of the number of credits earned by the end of 10 th grade. These achievement factors are shown for all sophomores (regardless of whether or not they dropped out later) in table 21. By definition (and as a baseline for comparison to table 23), 25 percent of the sophomore sample scored in the lowest quarter of the mathematics test, 50 percent scored in the middle two quarters, and 25 percent scored in the highest quarter. In terms of total credits earned in 9 th and 10 th grade (in all subjects, including courses such as physical education and art), student transcripts showed that a majority of students had earned at least 10 credits (Carnegie units, or a standardized measure of course taking) in all years. In 1980, seventy-one percent of sophomores had earned 10 or more credits, and this grew to 87 percent in 1990 and 97 percent in 2002. By 2002, fewer than 4 percent of sophomores were earning less than 10 credits by the end of 10 th grade. Dropout rates for students falling in these academic achievement categories are shown in table 22. In all years, dropout rates were higher for students in lower math test quarter groups than for those in higher math test quarter groups. In 2004, fourteen percent of those in the lowest quarter of their cohort dropped out, compared to 6 percent of those in the middle two math test quarters and 1 percent of those in the highest math test quarter. Dropout rates for students in the lowest quarter of their cohort on the math test increased from 17 percent in 1982 to 22 percent in 1992, then declined to 14 percent in 2004. Dropout rates also declined between 1992 and 2004 for sophomores in the middle two math test quarters, from 8 to 6 percent.  First Follow-up, Second Follow-up and High School Transcript Study, 1990-92\";andEducation Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS:2002), \"Base Year, First Follow-up and High School Transcript Study, 2002-04.\" Dropout rates for those with less than 10 credits from all courses were also higher than for those students with 10 or more credits earned by the end of 10 th grade. For example, in 2004, fifty-five percent of students who had earned 5-10 total credits dropped out, compared to 4 percent of those who had earned at least 10 credits. The dropout rates for students with 5-10 credits also increased from 1992 (21 percent) to 2004 (55 percent). Table 23 shows the distribution of dropouts themselves, providing information about which sophomore achievement subgroups were most represented among dropouts. There were no statistically significant differences across cohorts in the proportion of dropouts from each math test quarter group. However, in 1982 and 1992, sophomores who had scored in the lowest quarter of the math test distribution were the largest group of dropouts; in 2004, there was no difference in the percentage of dropouts from the lowest math test quarter and the middle two math test quarters. In all years, the percentage of dropouts from the highest math test quarter was lower than the percentage from other quarter groups. In 2004, some 48 percent of dropouts had scored in the lowest math test quarter as sophomores, 47 percent in the middle two quarters, and 5 percent in the highest quarter. Compared to about 4 percent of all sophomores (table 21), 31 percent of the 2004 dropouts earned fewer than 10 total credits by the end of their sophomore year (table 23),. Thus, for both math test score and credits earned, dropouts have poorer academic achievement than all sophomores.  1980-82\";National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88), \"First Follow-up, Second Follow-up andHigh School Transcript Study, 1990-92\";andEducation Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS:2002), \"Base Year, First Follow-up and High School Transcript Study, 2002-04.\" Table 24 presents a complementary view of academic achievement among sophomores who subsequently dropped out and sophomores who did not drop out using three variables. First, the average mathematics assessment score earned as a sophomore is an item-response theory (IRT) estimated score of the number of questions a student would have answered correctly if each assessment had used the same pool of items (see appendix A for more detail). The range of possible scores is 0 to 58 and is comparable across cohorts. For sophomores who did not drop out, the math test score in 1982 was 34, and in 2004, it was 38. By comparison, sophomores who subsequently dropped out had an average score of 24 items estimated correct on their sophomore math assessment in 1982; this rate was higher in 1992 and 2004, at 25 to 29 items estimated correct, respectively. Within cohorts, dropouts had lower math test scores than non-dropouts in all cohorts.  First Follow-up and High School Transcript Study 1980-82\";National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88), \"First Follow-up, Second Follow-up andHigh School Transcript Study, 1990-92\";andEducation Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS:2002), \"Base Year, First Follow-up and High School Transcript Study, 2002-04.\" Second, the average number of credits earned in academic courses (in the 2 years up to the end of 10 th grade) is presented (note that this number is different from tables 21 through 23, where all course credits were included; academic credits here refer to credits earned in major subjects of English, mathematics, science, social studies, and foreign language). Sophomores who subsequently dropped out earned fewer academic credits across all cohorts than those who did not drop out; non-dropouts earned about 10 academic credits through their sophomore year, compared to 6 academic credits for those who subsequently dropped out. Non-dropouts' academic credits earned was higher in 2002 than in 1980-10 versus 8-while dropouts' academic credits were also higher between these time points, at 6 versus 5 academic credits earned in 9 th and 10 th grade. Finally, table 24 reveals that the average academic GPA earned by the end of 10 th grade (for the two previous years) showed a change from 1990 to 2002 for non-dropouts of 0.2, from 2.4 to 2.6. However, dropouts' average academic GPA did not show any detectable difference across cohorts. Within cohorts, sophomores who subsequently dropped out had a lower academic GPA than non-dropouts in all years (1.4 versus 2.6, respectively, in 2002).\nCredits earned. In all years, estimates of credits earned were based on high school transcript data classified by the Secondary School Taxonomy of courses (SST). These high school credits were standardized as Carnegie units from the original school transcripts. Categories were less than 5 credits earned, 5 to less than 10 credits earned, and 10 or more credits earned. In tables 21 through 23, credits earned refers to all courses (in all subjects, including subjects such as physical education and art) taken in high school through 10 th grade; in table 24, credits earned refers to credits in academic courses taken in the 2 calendar years leading through 10 th grade. A filter was used to identify those respondents with complete transcripts. Since most HS&B transcript-identified courses are defined as full-year, and since a cross-cohort comparable measure was desired over 2 years (sophomore year to 2 years later), a filter of four courses listed in each of the 2 academic years was used. In table 24, credits earned refers to academic courses (i.e., only courses in English, mathematics, science, social studies, and foreign language)."}, {"section_title": "Chapter 3.

These results are listed in table 9 in order of their overall popularity and by sex. Most dropouts listed school-related reasons for leaving: 83 percent of dropouts left for one or more of these reasons, which included missing too many school days, thinking it would be easier to get a General Educational Development (GED) credential, getting poor grades, and not liking school. Eighty-nine percent of males cited school-related reasons for leaving, compared to 75 percent of females. Boys and girls differed in leaving for disciplinary problems. Twenty-three percent of males said they were suspended from school, and 15 percent of them said they were expelled. Nine percent of females said they were suspended, and 3 percent said they were expelled. The impact of changing schools differed by gender. Fifteen percent of males said they left school because they had changed schools and did not like the new one, while 7 percent of females said so. Dropouts also listed reasons for leaving that were external to the school setting: familyrelated reasons and employment-related reasons. Thirty-four percent of dropouts listed familyrelated reasons, including pregnancy, supporting family members, caring for a family member, becoming a parent, and getting married. Forty-five percent of female dropouts left school for family-related reasons, compared to 25 percent of males. Twenty-eight percent of females left school due to pregnancy. Twenty-five percent of females cited becoming a parent as a reason for dropping out, while 12 percent cited marriage. The comparable percentages for males were 6 percent and 3 percent. Thirty-five percent of dropouts cited employment-related reasons for leaving school, including getting a job and being unable to work and attend school at the same time. Forty-one percent of males stated employment reasons for leaving school, compared to 28 percent of females.  Figure 3 depicts the percentages of those stating any school-, family-, or employmentrelated reason for leaving school, by race/ethnicity. This figure addresses two related questions: first, within each racial group, what reasons for leaving school predominate? Second, did members of any group cite any category of reasons for leaving school more often than other groups? For the first question about the prevalence of stated reasons within groups, overall, each racial/ethnic subset of dropouts stated school-related reasons for leaving more frequently than employment-related or family-related reasons. In each group, at least 80 percent of dropouts listed school-related reasons. The 80 percent of dropouts listing school-related reasons for leaving may in part result from the greater number of response options offered under this category (questions were not organized in these categories). The second question (whether members of any ethnic/racial group were more likely than other groups to cite items within a list of reasons) yields few statistically significant patterns. The only statistically significant group difference observed in reasons given is between Hispanic and White dropouts; 44 percent of Hispanic dropouts left school for family-related reasons, compared to 27 percent of Whites."}, {"section_title": "Responses of Parents and Schools", "text": "Dropouts replied to a series of questions about the ways in which their parents and school personnel responded when they left school. The survey listed 13 possible parental responses and 12 possible school responses. Almost all dropouts (95 percent) reported a parental response, and 80 percent of them reported some kind of school response. Table 10 shows these responses by parents and schools, some of which apply to both parents and schools, while others are specific to either parents or schools.  The common parental and school responses are listed first, in order of parental popularity. Seventy-three percent of parents and 37 percent of school officials tried to talk the student into staying in school. Some parents and schools offered to help the student with school work. Thirty-three percent of dropouts said their parents offered to help make up missed work, and 22 percent said their parents offered to get special tutoring. The corresponding figures for schools are 32 percent and 17 percent. In terms of personal problems, 53 percent of the dropouts reported that their parents offered to help them with personal problems, and 24 percent said that their school personnel made that offer. Only parents could have responded in ways listed in the second set of responses. These parental responses are listed in order of popularity. Parents reacted in a variety of ways including not getting involved, contacting the school, or being upset. Seventy-four percent of dropouts reported that their parents told them that leaving school was the student's decision to make, and 18 percent said their parents told them it was okay to leave. At the same time, however, 65 percent of dropouts reported that their parents told them they were upset by the student's decision to leave school. Some dropouts reported that their parents contacted the school (32 percent called a school counselor and 31 percent called a principal or teacher). Some dropouts reported that their parents punished them for leaving (14 percent). Only schools could have responded in ways listed in the third set of responses, listed in order of popularity. Some of these responses involved telling the dropout what to do to return, such as maintain a certain grade point average (15 percent) or follow school discipline rules (14 percent). Some dropouts reported that the schools prevented them from returning by telling them they could not return (17 percent) or suspending or expelling them (14 percent). In 2004 dropouts were also asked whether they had ever participated in an alternative program. Alternative programs provide different courses and services than most students receive. These programs may take place within a traditional high school, or they may be separate schools. Alternative programs could include dropout prevention programs or programs for teenage parents, but not standard GED programs (i.e., those offering services or courses available to most students). However, most of the dropouts (75 percent) had never participated in any type of alternative program (results not shown in table)."}, {"section_title": "Status of High School Dropouts in 2004", "text": "In the 2004 survey, dropouts responded to questions about their current educational expectations and employment status. Table 11 shows their responses to these questions. Almost all of the dropouts expected to continue with their education. Two percent of them thought they would have less than high school graduation, while 15 percent planned on obtaining a GED, and 4 percent thought they would graduate from high school. However, 30 percent of dropouts did not know how far in school they expected to go; dropouts chose this response more than any other option, except for having \"some college.\" (No statistically significant difference was found between \"some college\" and \"don't know.\") Twenty-five percent of them thought that they would attend some college (a 1-to 2-year program or a 4-year program, but not completing a bachelor's degree), and 17 percent said that they expected to get a bachelor's degree. Dropouts also indicated whether they were employed as of the 2004 survey; 50 percent of them indicated they were. This result masks a difference between males and females, however (not shown): 57 percent of male dropouts were employed, compared to 42 percent of female dropouts. Of those (male or female) who were currently working, 31 percent worked 25-39 hours per week, and 31 percent worked 40 hours per week. Twenty-two percent said that they worked more than 40 hours per week.  , 1982-2004 This chapter traces changes in the characteristics of high school sophomores, in dropout rates, and in the characteristics of dropouts between 1982, 1992, and 2004. Four sets of student factors are examined in turn: background characteristics, educational supports, educational engagement, and academic achievement. These student factors were collected when the dropouts were in school in the 10 th grade in the spring of 1980, 1990, and 2002. For each of these sets of student characteristics, experiences, and outcomes, changes in overall sophomore cohort characteristics are examined first, establishing the context in which dropout rates and characteristics of dropouts change. Second, dropout rates are examined overall and by each set of factors, allowing a close documentation of changes in dropout behavior among certain student subgroups and students with selected experiences. Third, the distribution of dropouts across student subgroups is presented, documenting the extent to which specific characteristics or experiences apply to students who have dropped out. These dropout distributions may be considered as resulting both from changes in overall sophomore class characteristics and from changes in group-specific dropout rates. For example, if the proportion of the sophomore population that is White is lower in 2002 than in 1980, and their dropout rates do not increase substantially between these time points, then their presence as a proportion of all dropouts will also be lower (see tables 12-14 for this example). As with the rest of this report, the analysis focuses on high school sophomores who were also survey participants 2 years later. Sophomores from the classes of 1980, 1990, and 2002 were identified either as dropouts or as in-school or early completers in 1982, 1992, and 2004, respectively. Information on the high school sophomore class of 1980 comes from the High School and Beyond Longitudinal Study of 1980 Sophomores (HS&B-So:80/92), which included a base-year survey of sophomores in 1980 and a follow-up with these students in 1982. The 1990 sophomore class is examined through analysis of data from the 1990 \"freshened\" or augmented nationally representative sample of the sophomore cohort from the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88). This sophomore sample and their outcomes in 1992 are used here (see appendix A for more information). The specific estimates used in this chapter for the 1980 and 1990 cohorts of sophomores were obtained from the prior report by . The same analysis sample used in prior chapters is used for the analysis of 2002 sophomores and their 2004 dropout status (Education Longitudinal Study of 2002[ELS:2002). Since cohorts differ in many ways (only some of which are covered in this chapter), great care should be exercised in interpreting cross-cohort differences. Changes in the overall size, composition, and school and individual experiences of cohort members may be relevant for understanding the processes and implications of dropping out. For example, the size of the sophomore cohort population was 3.8 million in 1980, was 2.8 million in 1990, and 3.4 milllion in 2002 (Cahalan et al. 2006, p. iii). In addition, the experiences of students across cohorts may differ in ways not discussed here: for example, 36 percent of sophomores in 1980 reported being employed, while in 1990 and 2002, some 27 and 26 percent, respectively, of sophomores Late High School Dropouts: Characteristics, Experiences, and Changes Across Cohorts reported working at the time of the survey (Cahalan et al. 2006, p. viii). More extensive descriptions of some cross-cohort differences are provided in , which uses the same longitudinal cohort data as the current report. Note again that the dropout rates and distribution of dropouts are defined on the basis of students who dropped out between the spring of their sophomore year and 2 years later. Students who dropped out prior to the spring semester of their sophomore year (when each study surveyed its participants) are not included, and therefore their characteristics and experiences are not examined. In addition, dropout status is measured during the spring term of the typical senior year, which may underestimate dropout rates, because some students may have dropped out but subsequently returned to school. See chapter 1 for extended discussion of these issues. In reporting statistically significant differences among cohorts, the discussion focuses on 1982 to 2004 comparisons, adding information on 1992 versus 1982 or versus 2004 comparisons when the 1992 result is not in line with the overall  result. For each table, variables are discussed row by row. Within each variable, cross-cohort (within-subgroup) differences are reported first, such as the differences among the 1982, 1992, and 2004 dropout rates. This is followed by discussion of cross-subgroup (within-cohort) differences, such as differences among racial/ethnic groups in a specific year such as 2004."}, {"section_title": "Background Characteristics", "text": "Tables 12 through 14 report sophomore cohort characteristics, dropout rates, and dropout distributions by student background and family characteristics. The sophomore class characteristics table (table 12) describes all sophomores in 1980, 1990, and 2002, whether or not they later dropped out; this table provides the context for understanding the proportions of students affected by dropping out. The dropout rate table (table 13) specifically indicates the rates of dropping out for each student subgroup. Finally, the dropout distribution table (table 14) shows the percentage of dropouts in different student subgroup categories (e.g., the percentage of dropouts who were male versus female); this table provides information about which student subgroups are most represented among dropouts themselves. Comparing this table with table 12 shows which sophomore-to-dropout subgroups are over-or under-represented compared to all sophomores. Turning first to sophomore cohort characteristics, table 12 shows that the sex distribution of sophomores changed. In 1980, forty-eight percent of the sophomores were male, compared to 50.5 percent in 2002. The 2002 survey included a new \"more than one race\" category, which had not been an option in the 1980 and 1990 cohorts. Thus, a racial group's apparent change over time may reflect students' identifying themselves as of \"more than one race\" (4.3 percent in 2002) rather than one of the other categories. Yet comparisons of the 1980 and 2002 cohorts show that the percentage of sophomores who were Asian/Pacific Islander was higher (4 versus 1 percent), and the percent Hispanic (of any race) was higher (16 versus 8 percent), in 2002 than in 1980. Simultaneously, the percentage of sophomores who were White was lower in 2002 (60 percent) than in 1980 (76 percent).  1980, 1990, or 2002. 3 Includes two guardians, single guardian, and respondent to parent survey who lives with student less than half the time. Sophomore cohorts may differ with respect to grade repetition and age. If grade promotion policies have become more strict over time-especially if students are less likely to be promoted from the critical first year of high school (9 th grade)-then more sophomores could have experienced being held back, and the average age of sophomores would be higher. Although HS&B does not provide information on grade retention, data are available in NELS:88 and ELS:2002. The percentage of students held back in 9 th grade was not statistically different in Late High School Dropouts: Characteristics, Experiences, and Changes Across Cohorts 1990 versus 2002, with about 1 percent of students from both cohorts reporting repeating 9 th grade (not shown in table). 6 Changes in grade retention policies across multiple grades and changes in the age of entry to compulsory education may have resulted in differences in the age distributions of cohorts. Table 12 shows that the proportion of sophomores who were 15 years old and younger was higher in 1980 (60 percent) than in 1990 (45 percent). No statistically significant difference was observed between 1990 and 2002. The proportion of 16-year-olds rose from 38 percent in 1980 to 47 percent in 1990, and rose again to 49 percent in 2002. The proportion of sophomores ages 17 years or older was 5 percent in 1980; this rose to 9 percent in 1990 before falling back to 7 percent in 2002. In terms of family characteristics, there was a shift away from families with two parents and toward parent-plus-guardian and single-parent families. Students from families with two parents made up 70 percent of the sophomore class in 1980; in 2002, they made up 58 percent of the sophomore class. This change corresponded with a lower percentage of sophomores in parent-plus-guardian and single-parent families in 1980 compared to 2002 (9 and 17 percent, respectively, in 1980; and 16 and 21 percent in 2002). Changes in parental education represent an increase in family educational resources. (Parents' highest education level refers to highest level attained by either parent, guardians not included.) When 1980 is compared to 2002, the percentage of sophomores with at least one parent who had attended at least some college or more rose from 58 percent to 73 percent. In terms of dropout rates, declines were evident among all sophomores as well as among sophomores in most subgroups (table 13). The overall dropout rate in 1992 was lower compared to the 1982 rate (6 percent versus 11 percent), while showing no statistically significant change in the 1992 rate compared to 2004.  1980, 1990, or 2002. 3 Includes two guardians, single guardian, and respondent to parent survey who lives with student less than half the time. Both males and females had lower rates in 1992 than in 1982. In 1982, some 12 percent of males had dropped out, compared to 6 percent in 1992; in 2004, this rate had risen to 7 percent. The corresponding rates for females were 10 percent in 1982, which dropped to 7 percent in 1992 and remained lower in 2004 (though not statistically different from 1992) at 6 percent. Within cohorts, males had a higher dropout rate than females in 1982 and 2002-in 2002, seven percent of males dropped out, while 6 percent of females dropped out."}, {"section_title": "Late High School Dropouts: Characteristics, Experiences, and Changes Across Cohorts", "text": "For all racial/ethnic groups except Asians/Pacific Islanders, for whom no measurable difference was observed, dropout rates were lower in 2004 than in 1982. For example, the dropout rates for Hispanics was 19 percent in 1982 compared to 11 percent in 2004 (a higher rate than Asians/Pacific Islanders and Whites). Across racial/ethnic subgroups within each cohort, Black sophomores, at 14 percent, had higher dropout rates in 1982 than peers in other racial/ethnic groups (except Hispanic sophomores), and in 2004 continued to have higher dropout rates (10 percent) than all other racial/ethnic groups except Hispanics. (Note again the presence of the \"more than one race\" category in 2004, which may affect results.) Sophomores ages 17 or older dropped out at higher rates than their younger peers. For example, in 2004, some 28 percent of sophomores 17 years or older dropped out, compared to 7 percent of 16-year-old sophomores and 3 percent of 15-year-old or younger sophomores. The dropout rates for 16-year-old and 15-year-old or younger sophomores were lower in 2004 than in 1992 (no other statistically significant differences were observed). Students from families with two parents dropped out in lower proportions than students from different family types in all three cohorts. In 2004, four percent of students from families with two parents dropped out, compared to 9 percent of single-parent-family students, 10 percent of parent-plus-guardian-family students, and 7 percent of other family students. In 1982, dropout rates were highest among students from other family forms (e.g., two guardians or a single guardian), with 22 percent of sophomores dropping out by spring term 2 years later versus 15 percent for students from parent-plus-guardian families, 13 percent from single-parent families, and 6 percent from intact two-parent families. In 1992, other family students had dropout rates that were not measurably different than students from single-or parent-plus-guardian families, a finding that persisted in 2004. In all three cohorts, sophomores whose parents had attended some college (short of a bachelor's degree) or had attained more education dropped out 2 years later at lower rates than sophomores whose parents had only completed high school or less. (Parents' highest education level refers to highest level attained by either parent.) In 2004, five percent of students whose parents attended some college or attained more education dropped out, compared to 11 percent of students whose parents had only a high school diploma or less. In terms of changes over time, the dropout rate was lower in 2004 than in 1982 for students whose parents had at least some college (5 percent versus 7 percent); however, there was no measurable difference between the three cohorts for students whose parents had a high school education or less. Table 14 presents the distribution of spring-term dropouts within student background and family characteristics categories. The percentage of dropouts who were male was 45 percent in 1992, compared to 56 percent in 2004 (the 1982 to 1992 comparison was not statistically significant). Within racial/ethnic groups, because of a drop in the overall population (table 12) and a drop in the group-specific dropout rate (table 13), the proportion of dropouts who were White was lower in 2004 than in 1982 (44 versus 67 percent, respectively) (table 14). The representation of Blacks, Hispanics, and Asians/Pacific Islanders was higher in 2004 than in 1982 (21 versus 16 percent, 27 versus 13 percent, and 2 versus less than 1 percent, respectively). Whites remained the largest proportion of dropouts at 44 percent, though they were no longer the majority in 2004 as they were in 1992 (57 percent) and 1982 (67 percent). (Some portion of these changes may result from the introduction of a multiracial category in ELS:2002; however, as that only affects 5 percent of the 2004 population, significant differences that exceed 5 percentage points are likely to reflect real change.) The percentage of dropouts who were older (ages 17 or above as sophomores) increased from 17 percent in 1982 to 31 percent in 1992, while the percentage that was younger (15 years old or less) as sophomores declined from 37 percent of all dropouts in 1982 to 23 percent in 1992 (the 1992 versus 2004 comparisons of these percentages were not statistically significant).  1980, 1990, or 2002. 3 Includes two guardians, single guardian, and respondent to parent survey who lives with student less than half the time. The changes in the family characteristics of dropouts reflected the changes to all sophomores during this period. As with all sophomores, the proportion of dropouts who were from intact two-parent families fell from 51 percent in 1982 to 39 percent in 2004. The opposite change was observed for parent-plus-guardian and single-parent family students, whose proportion of all dropouts was higher in 2004 (25 and 31 percent, respectively) than in 1982 (15 and 24 percent, respectively). Finally, the proportion of dropouts whose parents completed some college or more was higher in 2004 (53 percent) than in 1982 (43 percent)."}, {"section_title": "Educational Supports", "text": "Tables 15 through 17 report sophomore cohort characteristics, dropout rates, and dropout distributions by mothers' educational expectations for their sophomore (as reported by the student). In comparison to educational expectations reported by the parent (chapter 2), maternal expectations as reported by the student are available for all three sophomore cohorts. Significant others' expectations have been linked to positive educational outcomes (e.g., Cohen 1983;Carbonaro 1998).  1980, 1990, and 2002, whether they dropped out later or not. Mothers' expectations for their sophomores' educational attainment (reported by the student) increased in two higher education categories. When 1980 is compared to 1990, the percentage of sophomores who said that their mother expected them to earn a bachelor's degree increased from 26 percent to 46 percent. This percentage was lower in 2002 (at 42 percent) than in 1990 but remained higher than the 1980 figure (26 percent). Mothers' reported expectations that their sophomores would earn a graduate or professional degree increased from 20 percent to 36 percent across the two later time points.

Finally, table 17 shows the percentage distribution of spring-term dropouts for reported maternal educational expectations; this table shows which student subgroups are most represented among dropouts. As with all sophomores, mothers of dropouts had higher reported expectations in 2002 than they did in 1980. Of those who dropped out in 1982, thirteen percent said their mothers expected them to attain a bachelor's degree and 12 percent said their mothers expected them to attain a graduate or professional degree. Of those who dropped out in 2004, these percentages were higher at 32 percent (bachelor's degree) and 23 percent (graduate/professional degree). The percentage of sophomores who reported that they did not know their mothers' expectations for them was lower in 1992 than in 1982 and showed no detectable difference in 2004 compared to 1992.  -up, 1980-82\";National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88), \"First and Second Follow-up, 1990-92\";andEducation Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS:2002), \"Base Year and First Follow-up, 2002-04.\""}, {"section_title": "Time Use and Coming to Class Prepared", "text": "Tables 18 through 20 present the overall sophomore cohort distribution, dropout rates, and the distribution of dropouts by measures of time use and coming to class prepared. These factors include time spent watching television or video on weekdays, 7 working outside the home, and doing homework, as well as how often the student attended class without books or without pencil or paper. Table 18 shows these measures for all sophomores in the three cohorts, whether or not they dropped out later. A large majority of sophomores spent less than 5 hours per weekday watching television or video in all years (in 2002, eighty-one percent of sophomores spent less than 5 hours, smaller than the 91 percent in 1990 but larger than the 72 percent in 1980). (Please note caveats in appendix A, section A.5.2.) Similarly large majorities worked 20 hours or less per week (in 2002, eighty-eight percent of sophomores worked 20 hours or less per week, an increase from 1980 as well as the 1990 low of 78 percent) and spent 1-10 hours a week on homework (in 2002, sixty-nine percent spent 1-10 hours per week on homework, a decline from 79 percent in 1990 and 87 percent in 1980). For homework, the percentage of sophomores spending 11 or more hours per week on homework was higher in 2002 than in 1990 and 1980 (23 percent versus 14 and 7 percent, respectively). The percentages of students reporting that they sometimes or often attended class without books or without pencil or paper were higher in 2002 than in 1990. In 2002, sixteen percent of students reported that they often or sometimes attended class without books (an increase from 1980 as well as from the 1990 low of 6 percent), and 17 percent of students reported that they often or sometimes attended class without paper or a pencil (an increase from 1980 as well as from the 1990 low of 10 percent). Table 19 shows spring-term dropout rates for sophomores 2 years later by time use and class preparation., No statistically significant difference in dropout rates was observed across cohorts for students who reported watching 5 or more hours of television or video per week. For students who reported watching fewer than 5 hours of television or video per week, the dropout rate was statistically significantly lower in 1992 and 2004 (5 and 6 percent, respectively) than in 1982 (8 percent). Within cohorts, dropout rates were lower for students who reported watching less than 5 hours of television or video per week than for students who reported watching 5 or more hours of television or video per week in 1992 (5 percent versus 10 percent) and in 2004 (6 percent versus 9 percent). 8 Dropout rates were lower in 2004 than in 1982 for students working over 20 hours per week (10 percent in 2004 and 14 percent in 1982; no significant difference was observed when 2004 was compared to 1992). For students working 20 hours or less per week, dropout rates in 2004 were higher than in 1992 (6 percent versus 5 percent) but lower than in 1982 (8 percent). Within each cohort, students reporting working over 20 hours per week dropped out at higher rates than students reporting working 20 hours or less per week. Dropout rates were lower in 1992 than in 1982 by 11 percentage points for students who did no homework during the week (26 versus 15 percent), while no difference was observed in the later period between 1992 and 2004. Among those who reported doing 11 or more hours of homework per week, there was no measurable difference in dropout rates when 1982 (5 percent) is compared to 2004 (4 percent); however, the dropout rate for this group was lower in 1992 (2 percent) than in either other year. Dropout rates declined for students coming to class prepared, as measured by the frequency of seldom or never coming to class without books and the frequency of seldom or never coming to class without pencil/paper. Between 1982 and 1992, dropout rates declined from 8 to 6 percent for both groups of students (no statistical difference was observed between 1992 and 2004). Also between 1982 and 1992, dropout rates declined for students coming to class unprepared. Dropout rates for students coming to class often or sometimes without books was 19 percent in 1982 and 11 percent in 1992. Dropout rates for students coming to class often or sometimes without pencil or paper was 15 percent in 1982 and 8 percent in 1992. In both cases, no statistical difference was observed between 1992 and 2004. Finally, table 20 shows which time use and class preparation subgroups are most represented among dropouts. As with all sophomores, the percentage of dropouts in 2004 who reported working more than 20 hours per week as sophomores was lower than in 1992 and 1982 (17 percent versus 34 and 32 percent, respectively). The percentage of dropouts reporting that they did not do any homework declined from 21 percent in 1982 to 15 percent in 2004. Unlike for all sophomores, there was no statistically significant change between 1982 and 2004 in television watching for dropouts. As with all sophomores, a greater percentage of dropouts reported attending class without books in 2004 than in 1982, though the percentage of dropouts reporting so was less in 1992 than in either 1982 or 2004. Of 1982 dropouts, 18 percent said they often or sometimes attended class without books, compared to 12 percent of 1992 dropouts and 24 percent of the 2004 dropouts. However, there was no change in the percentage of dropouts who reported that they had attended class without pencil or paper when 2004 was compared to 1982 (again, though, the 1992 percentage of 14 percent of dropouts represented a low across cohorts). Like all sophomores, majorities of dropouts in all cohorts watched less than 5 hours of television or video on weekdays, worked 20 hours or less per week, did 1-10 hours of homework per week, and seldom or never attended class without books or paper or pencil. Except for the middle homework category (1-10 hours per week), dropouts experienced each of these distractions and came to class unprepared at higher percentages than sophomores overall. For example, while 19 percent of all sophomores in 2004 watched 5 or more hours of television or video per weekday (table 18), 27 percent of dropouts did so (table 20). Nevertheless, as with all sophomores, the majority of dropouts in each cohort attended class prepared and were in the lowest categories of hours per week working or watching television or video."}, {"section_title": "Chapter 5. Conclusion", "text": "This report examined late high school dropout rates and experiences of the spring 2002 sophomore cohort and comparisons of late high school dropout rates and the distribution of dropouts in 1982, 1992, and 2004. The report is provided with the caution that the relationships between characteristics and dropping out are purely correlational and do not indicate causality; a different type of analysis is required to determine causality. Examinations of changes over time indicated a relatively stable dropout rate between 1992 and 2004. A number of subgroup differences in dropout rates and dropout experiences was observed throughout the analysis and these subgroup differences were relatively consistent when 2004 was compared to 1982. It is important to emphasize that the current findings address only dropping out in late high school and do not cover those students who dropped out before the spring of 10 th grade. For this reason, rates reported here will be lower than those based on the students' entire high school or earlier school career, and comparisons across time involving cumulative dropout rates may produce different results. In addition, because the dropout rate used in this report does not count alternative completers (e.g., recipients of the General Educational Development [GED] credential) as dropouts, this rate should not necessarily be interpreted as the inverse of an overall graduation rate. Of high school sophomores in 2002, about 7 percent were out of school in the spring of 2004; this rate was not statistically different from 1992 (tables 2 and 13). Males had higher dropout rates than females. Asians/Pacific Islanders had lower dropout rates than Whites, who left school in smaller proportions than Black or Hispanic students (table 2). Relatively disadvantaged students, in terms of family socioeconomic status and parental education, had higher dropout rates than their more affluent peers (table 3). Those attending public high schools had higher rates of dropping out than those in Catholic or other private high schools, and students in high poverty schools and schools where minorities predominate dropped out at higher rates (table 4). In addition, sophomores whose parents and teachers did not expect them to go far in school had higher dropout rates (table 5). Those whose teachers believed they were engaged in the classroom had higher rates of staying in school than those whose teachers did not think so (table 6). Sophomores who reported that they were prepared for class and engaged with school had lower rates of dropping out than students who did not have these habits and attitudes (table 7). Dropout rates varied by levels of academic performance. Students who had been held back a grade, those who had lower 9 th -grade GPAs, and those who had lower 10 th -grade scores on reading and math tests had higher dropout rates than those who had performed better academically (table 8). Students had many different experiences as they left school. Respondents could choose from a number of reasons for leaving school, most of which pertained to the school environment, and could choose multiple reasons simultaneously. While most listed reasons for leaving that are associated with the school, such as getting poor grades and not liking school, some left for family-related reasons or for employment-related reasons. Both males and females and members of every racial/ethnic group identified school reasons for leaving at higher rates than other Late High School Dropouts: Characteristics, Experiences, and Changes Across Cohorts reasons (table 9 and figure 2). Females said they left for family-related reasons at higher rates than males and said they left for employment-related reasons at lower rates than males. Dropouts reported experiencing a range of responses from schools and parents to their decision to leave (table 10). Seventy-three percent of dropouts said that their parents tried to talk the student into staying in school, and 53 percent said their parents offered to help with personal problems. Parents also responded by telling the dropout that leaving school was his or her decision to make (74 percent of dropouts indicating this) or telling the student that they were upset (64 percent). Dropouts most often reported that their schools tried to talk them into staying in school (37 percent of dropouts reporting this) and offered to help them make up missed work (32 percent). In considering their current status and future plans, 50 percent of dropouts had jobs at the time of the survey, and most expected to go further in school than they had as of spring 2004 (table 11). The demography of the sophomore population shifted between 1980 and 2002. For example, a greater percentage of sophomores were Hispanic in 2002 than in 1980, and a smaller percentage of sophomores came from two-parent households in 2002 than in 1980 (table 12). A comparison of dropout rates between 1982 and 1992 showed a decline from 11 to 6 percent; this decline was evident among both males and females and all racial/ethnic groups except Asians/Pacific Islanders (table 13). Homework hours were higher in 2004 than in 1982 for all sophomores, and distractions of television and outside work were lower between these two time points (table 18); dropout rates for less-prepared and more-distracted students markedly declined when 2004 was compared to 1982, as well (table 19). The percentage of sophomores overall who earned very few credits was lower in 2002 than in 1980 (table 21), but dropout rates remained high or were higher for sophomores in certain few-credits-earned categories (table 22). Those who dropped out had lower academic achievement when they were sophomores.

This report uses questionnaire data collected in the HS&B base year (1980) from the senior cohort and transcript data collected for the 1980 sophomore cohort in the first follow-up (1982). Base-year data collection took place in the spring term of the 1979-80 academic year with a two-stage probability sample. Some 1,015 schools served as the first-stage units, and 35,723 sophomores and 34,981 seniors within these schools were the second-stage units and eligible to participate (of whom about 58,000 participated in the base year).

In addition, to better understand the school and home contexts for the sample members, data were collected from teachers (a teacher comment form in the base year asked for teacher perceptions of HS&B sample members), principals, and a subsample of parents. With the study design expanded to include a sophomore cohort, HS&B provided critical data on the relationships between early high school experiences and students' subsequent educational experiences in high school. For the first time, national data were available that showed students' academic growth and how family, community, school, and classroom factors were associated with student learning. Researchers were able to use data from the extensive battery of achievement tests within the longitudinal study to assess growth in knowledge and cognitive skills over time.

Many of the innovations and design features of NELS:88 were carried over into ELS:2002. Data collection for NELS:88 was initiated with the 8 th -grade class of 1988 in the spring term of the 1987-88 school year. Along with a student survey, NELS:88 included surveys of parents (base-year and second follow-up), teachers (base-year, first follow-up, and second A-5 follow-ups), and school administrators (base-year, first follow-up, and second follow-ups). The sample was also surveyed after scheduled high school graduation, in 1994 and 2000. 2 NELS:88 base year. The NELS:88 base year (1988) successfully surveyed 24,599 students, out of some 26,432 selected 8 th -graders, across 1,052 public, Catholic, and other private schools. In addition to filling out a questionnaire, students also completed assessments in four subjects (the NELS:88 achievement battery included tests in reading, mathematics, science, and social studies). The base year also surveyed one parent, two teachers, and the principal of each selected student. NELS:88 first follow-up. A first follow-up took place in 1990. At that time, student cohort members, their teachers, and their principals were resurveyed. In addition, the sample was freshened by adding new members to obtain a nationally representative sample of the high school sophomore class of 1990 and to allow cohort comparisons between the NELS:88 sophomores and the HS&B sophomores. The first follow-up gathered data from 18,221 participating students (not including dropouts, who were followed with certainty), including 797 new sample members from grade 10. Of this total sample, 18,176 are sophomores, and this sophomore cohort forms the basis of the current analysis. Eighth-graders from the base-year sample who dropped out or were not 10 th -graders in 1990 are not included in the current study. NELS:88 second follow-up. The second follow-up took place in the spring term of the 1991-92 school year, when most sample members were in their final semester of high school. As with the first follow-up, the second follow-up was freshened with additional members to produce a nationally representative sample of the senior class of 1992. This follow-up provided a culminating measurement of learning in the course of secondary school and also collected information to facilitate investigation of the transition into the labor force and postsecondary education after high school. NELS:88 third and fourth follow-ups. The third follow-up took place in 1994 when most sample members had completed high school.

ELS:2002 also obtained information from students about their attitudes and experiences. These same students (including those who dropped out of school) were tested and surveyed again in 2004 (and the sample freshened to provide a nationally representative sample of high school seniors), and reinterviewed in 2006. 2 The entire arc of NELS:88, from its baseline through its final follow-up in 2000, is described in Curtin et al.

Several procedures are available for calculating the exact standard errors of estimates in surveys with a complex sample design, such as ELS:2002, where the sample is stratified, clustered, and statistically adjusted to compensate for nonresponse. Weights are provided so that procedures such as Taylor Series approximations, Balanced Repeated Replication (BRR), and Jackknife Repeated Replication (JRR) can be used to estimate correct, design-adjusted standard errors. Advanced statistical programs such as SUDAAN, AM, or Stata produce similar results.

This report uses data collected in the HS&B base year (1980) and the first follow-up (1982). Independent variables come from the sophomore data, which were collected in the spring of 1980, and the key outcome is enrollment status in the spring of 1982. The study provided for a national probability sample of 1,015 secondary schools as the first units of selection. In the second stage, 36 seniors and 36 sophomores were selected in each school. Schools with high percentages of Hispanic students, Catholic schools with a high percentage of minority students, alternative public schools, and private schools with high achieving students were oversampled. The sophomore cohort, which is the target population in this report, was followed up in 1982, 1984, 1986, and 1992. In the base year, the unweighted response rate from schools was 70 percent and from students was 84 percent. 4 Case weights were adjusted for nonresponse for both schools and students. High school transcripts were collected from a subsample of the sophomore cohort in 1982 when most of them were seniors. For the transcript subsample of about 18,500 sophomores, transcripts were received for approximately 16,200 students, yielding an unweighted unit response rate of 88 percent. The HS&B sample used in this report was the 1980 sophomore cohort who were also members of the first follow-up (FU1PART = 1). Including sample members in both the base year and first follow-up resulted in an overall sample size of about 14,100 5 students. Most analyses were weighted by the first follow-up weight (FU1WT). Analyses that use the transcript data include about 13,000 sophomores for whom transcript data were obtained and employ the high school transcript study weight (TRWT). In addition, in the process of equating the HS&B mathematics test data with the NELS:88 test data, a special weight was created by the Educational Testing Service. This weight was used for analyses of the HS&B mathematics test data (TESTWT). NELS:88. NELS:88 differs from HS&B and ELS:2002 in that the first data collection phase began in the 8 th grade rather than the sophomore or senior year; nonetheless, through a freshening procedure, NELS:88 generated nationally representative sophomore and senior cohorts as well. The data used in this report are from sophomores surveyed in the first follow-up conducted in 1990 and who were also participants in the second follow-up conducted in 1992. In the first follow-up, known dropouts were followed with certainty, and a 50 percent subsample was drawn of \"potential dropouts\"-students who had been absent on both survey and make-up days (though identified as students by their school) or who had not been located subsequentlyso that, with intensive additional follow-up, any remaining \"hidden dropouts\" could be uncovered. In the second follow-up, all dropouts were followed with certainty. The base-year (8 th -grade) cohort was drawn from a stratified national probability sample of 1,052 public and private 8 th -grade schools from which about 25,000 students participated in the base-year study. Additional follow-ups were implemented in 1994 and 2000, and postsecondary transcripts collected in 2000-2001. The unweighted response rate at the baseline 8 th -grade school level was 70 percent for the initial school selections. Replacement schools were used to achieve a realized sample of 815 public and 237 private schools. The 8 th -grade student questionnaire completion rate was 93 percent. Two years later, most students had dispersed to new schools; 99 percent (unweighted) of these schools cooperated. The first follow-up (1990) student questionnaire completion rate was 94 percent unweighted and 91 percent weighted. The unweighted second follow-up (1992) student questionnaire completion rate was 93 percent and 91 percent weighted. Case weights were adjusted for nonresponse. The NELS:88 sample used was the 1990 sophomore spring cohort (G10COHRT = 1) who were also members of the first follow-up/second follow-up panel (F2F1PNFL = 1). (That is, they were participants in both the 1990 First Follow-up Survey and the 1992 Second Follow-up Survey.) This resulted in an overall sample size of 16,749 students. This sample of students included freshened 1990 sophomores-those students added to the original sample to create a valid probability sample of students enrolled in the 10 th grade in the 1989-90 school year. The first follow-up/second follow-up panel weight was used for most of the analyses (F2F1PNWT). NELS:88 also included a transcript study, which was designed to be comparable to the HS&B:80 transcript study. Transcripts were received for approximately 17,300 of the NELS:88 transcript sample of about 19,300 students, yielding an unweighted unit response rate of 88 percent. Analyses of the transcript data used the high school transcript weight (F2TRSCWT) as well as the sophomore cohort sample flag (G10COHRT = 1)."}, {"section_title": "ELS:2002.", "text": "The ELS:2002 base-year study was carried out in a national probability sample of 752 public, Catholic, and other private schools in the spring term of the 2001-02 school year. Of 17,591 eligible selected sophomores, 15,362 completed a base-year questionnaire. The unweighted response rate at the school level was 62 percent and at the sophomore baseline level student questionnaire completion was 87 percent (both weighted and A-9 unweighted). In the first follow-up (2004), the student questionnaire completion rate was 95 percent unweighted and 93 percent weighted. Case weights were adjusted for nonresponse. In addition to the first follow-up and transcript surveys described above, the second follow-up sample included 14,200 respondents out of an eligible 15,900, yielding an overall weighted unit response rate of 88 percent. Unless otherwise specified, the weight used in all analyses for ELS:2002 estimates was F1PNLWT, a base-year/first follow-up panel weight in which freshened sample members in 2004 have a weight of zero and do not contribute to estimates. Similarly, some base-year nonrespondents for whom some base-year measures were imputed would be included in this measure, but on other items this small subset of the cases will have missing data, and they do not contribute to the analysis. The analysis sample based on F1PNLWT includes only those sample members who were members of the 10 th -grade class of 2002. This analysis sample consisted of 14,713 sample members. All estimates project to the national population of high school sophomores in 2002 and their experiences 2 years later. Analyses based on high school transcript data use the high school transcript weight (F1TRSCWT) and grade 10 cohort flag (G10COHRT = 1); these analyses are based on a sample of about 14,300 transcripts received from the approximately 16,200 members of the 10 th -grade cohort, yielding a 90.6 weighted unit response rate. Analyses of the sophomore cohort of 2002 in chapter 4 used a base-year questionnaire weight (BYSTUWT) that results in a sample of 15,360. Dropout analyses in chapter 3 were conducted with a sample of 677 respondents who answered the first follow-up Not Currently in School questionnaire. This population represents dropouts who were members of the 10 th -grade class of 2002. The base-year measures, including their academic achievement, came from their 10 th -grade data. Chapter 3 focuses on their decision to leave school and their experiences after they left. Analyses in chapter 1 incorporate information on high school enrollment or General Educational Development (GED) status in 2006, two years after their expected high school graduation. Enrollment and completion status in 2006 was based on first and second follow-up surveys, as well as information from high school transcripts. Analyses involving 2006 enrollment status were based on grade 10 cohort membership (G10COHRT = 1) and a base-year to second follow-up panel weight (F2BYWT). Nonresponse adjustment and exclusion rates across HS&B, NELS:88, and ELS:2002. In NELS:88 and ELS:2002, spring dropout status was imputed if not known. Also, in HS&B, NELS:88, and ELS:2002, adjustments were made to the weights to account for nonresponse, both at the school level and the individual level. A classification scheme was used that defined dropouts as one of the basic sample groups, with weighting adjustments effected either through a weighting cell (HS&B, NELS:88) or model-based (ELS:2002) approach. In the weighting cell approach (HS&B, NELS:88), classes were defined in such a way that nonrespondents in the group tended to resemble the group's respondents. The classification scheme included dropouts as a nonresponse adjustment cell-the cells were based on roster sex and roster race and enrollment status groups. In the modeling approach (ELS:2002 in 2004), weights adjusted for nonresponse included a number of predictor variables, one of which was enrollment status. Enrollment status was expressed in three terms: in school, in grade; in school, out of grade; and out of school (dropout). 6 While such approaches can work to minimize bias of estimates, they assume-as the target population to be projected to-the universe of cohort members who are eligible to participate. If not all members of a grade cohort are eligible, then estimates of, for example, dropout rates may differ from estimates for the full (eligible plus ineligible) population, and to this extent may be misleading. The analyses in this report do not use the NELS:88 expanded sample and expanded sample weights (expanded samples include sample members who were questionnaire-ineligible for reasons of language fluency or disability). It is likely that both HS&B and NELS:88 therefore slightly underestimate the proportion of the full cohort with a spring-term dropout status, although the exclusion rate in NELS:88, for example, was less than 2 percent. The expanded sample in ELS:2002 was not used because student questionnaire data are missing and follow-up enrollment status was not collected. The exclusion levels were so low (0.6 percent) that while the direction of their effect should be a negative bias that underestimates the cohort dropout rate, the effect will be miniscule. The HS&B and NELS:88 weighting cell approach that keeps dropouts as a separate classification category is fully documented in Tourangeau et al. (1983) and Ingels et al. (1994a). Analyses of ELS:2002 show that propensity models and weighting cell approaches to nonresponse adjustment give essentially similar results (Siegel, Copello, and Chromy 2007), thus confirming with data from the high school longitudinal studies series conclusions reached by earlier investigators using other data sets (Folsom and Witt 1994;Rizzo et al. 1994;and Kalton and Flores-Cervantes 2003). Schools run by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) are excluded from the sample in each of these studies, so American Indian students attending such schools are omitted from these analyses (about 10 percent of all American Indian students attended BIA schools during the time frame that ELS:2002 covers). In ELS:2002, American Indian students comprised 1 percent of the sample, and standard errors for the estimates for this group are large. The dropout rate for this sample of American Indian students cannot be accurately determined.

Stand-alone statements reporting individual estimates (i.e., percentages or means) without implicit or explicit comparisons to other estimates do not involve questions of statistical significance. The statistical comparisons in this report were based on the t statistic. Whether the difference between two groups is considered statistically significant or not is determined by calculating a t value for the difference between a pair of means or proportions and comparing this value to published tables of values, called critical values (cv). The alpha level is an a priori statement of the probability that a difference exists in fact rather than by chance. Analyses in this report use an alpha level of 0.05. No adjustments for multiple comparisons were used. The t statistic between estimates from various subgroups presented in the tables can be computed by using the following formula: where x 1 and x 2 are the estimates to be compared (e.g., the weighted means of observed sample members' values in two groups), and SE 1 and SE 2 are their corresponding standard errors. This formula is valid only for independent estimates. When the estimates are not independent (a handful of comparisons in this report are based on dependent estimates), a covariance term was added to the denominator of the formula.

(2005b). Comment on cross-cohort variables. Some of the analyses in the prior cross-cohort dropout report, on which chapter 4 is based , could not be extended to the ELS:2002 sample because of differences between HS&B or NELS:88 variables and ELS:2002 versions. For example, the question about repeating grades could not be estimated in a similar manner as in the prior report because those measures are collected from 8 th -grade students in NELS:88 and 10 th -grade students in ELS:2002. The ELS students had two more grades in which they could have been held back. These and other examples introduced more variability into the across-cohort measure than the authors felt could be justified for establishing accurate cross-cohort readings."}, {"section_title": "A.5.1 Dropout Status", "text": "To provide a more detailed picture of dropouts in the United States, NCES defines and calculates different types of dropout rates. There are three basic types of rates calculated-event, status, and cohort-each of which provides unique information about the student dropout population. As a complement to these statistics, NCES also computes high school graduation and completion rates. Definitions of each of the types of dropout rates are as follows: \u2022 Event rates describe the proportion of students who leave high school each year without completing a high school program. Offering an annual measure of recent dropout occurrences, event rates can provide important information about educators' effectiveness in keeping students enrolled in school. \u2022 Status rates provide cumulative data on dropouts among all young adults within a specified age range. Status rates are generally much higher than event rates because they include all dropouts regardless of when they last attended school. Because status rates reveal the extent of the dropout problem in the population, this rate also can be used to estimate the need for further education and training that will help dropouts participate fully in the economy and life of the nation. \u2022 Cohort rates measure what happens to a cohort of students over a period of time. This rate is based on repeated measures (typically grounded in spring term) of a group of students with a shared characteristic (typically, grade) and reveals how many students starting in a specific grade drop out over time. Cohort rates from longitudinal studies often provide more background and contextual data on the students who drop out than are available through the U.S. Census Bureau's Current Population Survey (CPS) or NCES's Common Core of Data (CCD) data collections. In the current report, cohort rates are used. Besides dropout rates, NCES reports high school graduation and completion rates. It is important to note that no definition of dropout rates is necessarily the inverse of these or other graduation or completion rates. For example, those who graduate from high school late and alternative completers (such as GED recipients) may not be counted as either dropouts or regular graduates (i.e., regular diploma recipients). Thus, a dropout rate of 10 percent does not imply a graduation rate of 90 percent. In the current report, cohort rates are used based on the three longitudinal high school studies described earlier. None of the three high school cohort studies comprehensively catalogues all dropout events, even though dropout events, when known from school enrollment status updates, are included in specially constructed \"ever drop out\" variables. This report uses a time-specific status definition of a dropout, specifically focusing on dropouts in the spring 2 years after their sophomore year, when they should have been seniors. Some individuals who are classified as students in the spring of their senior year may have had past dropout events but reentered school in time to be counted as a spring-term student. Dropout status, spring 1982. The original dropout status variable in HS&B was defined somewhat differently than in the status variable in NELS:88, particularly in their handling of A-13 those in GED program. Specifically, HS&B originally considered those who were in \"alternative\" programs-such as those leading to a GED, or those who had received a GED-as dropouts, not students or completers respectively. But as can be seen in , those enrolled in an alternative program leading to an equivalency credential or who received an equivalent certificate, such as a GED, are not counted as dropouts. Several modifications were made to the original HS&B definition. In this report, if FUSTTYPE (HS&B:80 first follow-up student type) was equal to 2 (dropout) and the respondent did not have a GED (FD16 was not equal to 4) and was not currently enrolled in a GED program (FD36AA equal to 1 and FD36F equal to 3), then the sample member was considered a dropout. Otherwise the sample member was considered a student or early completer. Dropout status, spring 1992. If F2DOSTAT (NELS:88 second follow-up dropout status) was equal to 5 (dropout, no return) a sample member was considered a dropout. Otherwise the sample member was considered a student or early completer. Dropout status, spring 2004. If F1DOSTAT (ELS:2002 first follow-up dropout status) was equal to 1 (dropout), then the sample member was considered a dropout. Respondents with prior dropout episode but who were in school as of their final enrollment status update at the school's survey day were coded as in-school students. Those still in school, early graduates, and alternative completers (e.g., had received a GED) are implicitly identified as part of the in-school or early completer category. Dropout status, 2006. While most of this report focuses on the students' dropout status 2 years after the sophomore year, chapter 1 describes more detailed status categories 4 years after the sophomore year when respondents would have had more time to get a diploma or equivalent. Dropout status in 2006 comes from transcript, first follow-up, and second follow-up data (each used to construct F2HSSTAT). Those whose graduation dates were unknown (less than 1 percent of the sample) were counted as summer 2004 or earlier graduates. In this report, those with GEDs or certificates of attendance (no completion dates from F2HSSTAT) were placed into a \"GED/certificate of attendance\" category, while those still in high school or working toward a GED were combined into a \"working toward diploma or equivalency\" category, with all others considered to be dropouts. Assignment of the Not Currently in School questionnaire. ELS:2002 analyses in chapter 3 of this report are based on completion of the Not Currently in School (dropout) questionnaire. For purposes of questionnaire assignment, a dropout was defined as an individual who, during the spring term of 2004, according to the school or home, had not been in school for 4 consecutive weeks or more and was not absent due to accident or illness; or a student who, during the spring term of 2004, had been in school less than 2 weeks after a period in which he or she had missed school for 4 or more consecutive weeks not due to accident or illness. If, however, a student had been classified as a dropout (according to the above definition) in an earlier enrollment status update with the school, but at the time of the base-year school's first follow-up survey day had been back in school 2 weeks or more, that individual was administered the student questionnaire."}, {"section_title": "A-14", "text": "Late High School Dropouts: Characteristics, Experiences, and Changes Across Cohorts"}, {"section_title": "A.5.2 Key Cross-Cohort Variables", "text": "This section describes the variables used in the chapter 4 cross-cohort analysis and includes information about each cohort's data and any modifications of variables for this analysis.

If this assumption was not valid, then the differences in the amount of homework done between HS&B and NELS:88 should be even greater than shown here. Additionally, the cut points for this variable changed in the classification for doing 10 hours of homework a week.

These differences should have a minimal impact on the estimates presented here.

Although the three studies have been designed to produce comparable results, differences between them may affect the comparability and precision of estimates."}, {"section_title": "A.6.1 Eligibility", "text": "Similar definitions were used to determine school eligibility across the studies. Vocational schools, Bureau of Indian Affairs schools, special education schools, and ungraded schools were excluded from the sample. To be in the studies, schools had to be operational with membership in the appropriate grades (10 th grade for HB&B and ELS, 8 th grade for NELS). Schools were contacted based on a national probability sample, and private schools were oversampled. There were greater differences in student eligibility. In HS&B and NELS:88, students who were unable to complete the survey instruments (the assessment battery and questionnaire) owing to severe mental or physical disability, or a language barrier, were declared ineligible and A-25 excluded from the sample. While the proportion excluded in HS&B is unknown, 8 ineligibility and exclusion in NELS:88 was carefully monitored. In the base year, just over 5 percent of 8 thgraders were excluded from the study. A special substudy was conducted to examine two issues: whether eligibility status would change over time for these students, and how many dropped out. In the NELS:88 first follow-up, it was determined that these exclusions did indeed affect the dropout rate. Specifically, 6 percent of cohort members in the eligible sample were dropouts in the spring term 2 years after 8 th grade compared to 6.8 percent based on the expanded (i.e., full) sample (Ingels 1996). This means that if the full cohort is taken as the target population, the eligible-only dropout rate shows a bias of -0.8. Bias can be seen in subgroup estimates as well. Bias for Asians/Pacific Islanders is -0.9; for Hispanics, -0.4; for Blacks, -0.2; and for Whites, -0.3 (Ingels 1996, table A). 9 In addition to having a dropout rate almost triple that of their peers, only 58 percent of the excluded base-year students who were in school 4 years later (1992) were seniors; 42 percent were behind the modal grade progression for the cohort (Ingels 1996, table 3). Clearly ineligible students in NELS:88 (and, presumably, HS&B) have very different high school completion trajectories than the cohort as a whole. However, in ELS:2002, just over one half of 1 percent of the sample were ineligible, and their status will not affect the overall rates, though specific subgroup comparisons may be affected."}, {"section_title": "A.6.2 Sample Design Differences", "text": "Differences in sampling rates, sample sizes, and design effects across the studies also affect precision of estimation and comparability. Asian/Pacific Islander students, for example, were oversampled in NELS:88 and ELS:2002 but not in HS&B, where their numbers were quite small. Also, although Catholic schools were oversampled in two of the three studies, HS&B had few (only 38) private non-Catholic schools. The base-year (1980) participating sample in HS&B numbered 30,030 sophomores. In contrast, 15,362 sophomores participated in the base year of ELS:2002. Cluster sizes within schools were larger for HS&B (on average, 30 sophomores per school) than for ELS:2002 (just over 20 sophomores per school; larger cluster sizes are better for school effects research but carry a penalty in greater sample inefficiency). Mean design effect (a measure of sample efficiency) 10 also is quite variable across the studies: for example, for the modal 12 th -grade year, 3.6 for HS&B and 3.7 for NELS:88, with the most favorable design effect, 2.3, for the ELS:2002 first follow-up. Other possible sources of difference between the cohorts that may impair change measurement are different levels of sample attrition over time and changes in the population of nonrespondents. To adjust for nonresponse, a weighting cell approach was used in HS&B and NELS:88, and a modeling approach in ELS:2002. ELS:2002 data were used to conduct a methodological comparison of the propensity modeling and weighting cell approaches to 8 Though the proportion of excluded students in HS&B is unknown, attempts to match the HS&B sample to national disability estimates suggest substantial exclusion of this group (see Hoachlander 1991). 9 For excluded students, race/ethnicity and sex were available from the school rosters, and enrollment status was determined via the enrollment status screener (see Ingels 1996, appendix B). Students whose eligibility status changed were brought back into the sample, surveyed, and tested. They responded to the New Student Supplement, which had more complete student information. 10 Effective sample size can be quite different from the nominal sample size; effective sample size is more meaningful than raw sample size in terms of statistical analysis-for example, the sampling variance of a mean standard score is equal to the reciprocal of the effective sample size, not the reciprocal of the raw sample size. Effective sample size may be defined as the raw sample size divided by the design effect."}, {"section_title": "A-26", "text": "Late High School Dropouts: Characteristics, Experiences, and Changes Across Cohorts nonresponse adjustment (see appendix H of Ingels et al. 2007). However, and in conformity to the literature, the approaches yield highly similar weights. Across the three studies, similar but only sometimes identical adjustment variables were used."}, {"section_title": "A.6.3 Participation Rates", "text": "Response rates also differ somewhat across the studies, although nonresponse-adjusted weights were generated for each of the cohorts. At the school level, response rates were somewhat higher in HS&B and NELS:88 (unweighted, around 70 percent) than in ELS:2002 (unweighted, 62 percent). School nonresponse bias analyses were performed for each study and may be found in the study documentation. At the student level, there is even more variation in response rates. In HS&B, 84.6 percent of 1980 sophomore cohort members completed a questionnaire (Zahs et al. 1995, p. 66). In the NELS:88 second follow-up, 92.5 percent of students participated (Ingels et al. 1994a), and in ELS:2002, 93.6 percent of the in-school sample was surveyed in the first follow-up (all response rates are unweighted)."}, {"section_title": "A.6.4 Changing Race Definitions", "text": "In some cases, federal race definitions or preferences for the means of collecting ethnicity and race data have changed. In HS&B and NELS:88, students were asked to mark one race only. Based on revised race-reporting guidelines issued by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), ELS:2002 added a new race category, and, more important, students are now allowed to mark all that apply, thus generating a further category, More than one race. The new race category is Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander. For purposes of cross-cohort comparisons, cases identified in ELS:2002 as Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander were combined with the Asian category to achieve comparability with earlier studies. However, for students who considered themselves to be more than one race, there is no ready means to map them back into a one-race scheme. With five race categories and with values based on a single race reported, none reported, the 10 possible combinations of 2 races, the 10 possible combinations of 3 races, the 5 possible combinations of 4 races, and the possibility of a combination of all 5 races, there are 32 separate race categories. It is impossible to know, for example, whether a student who marked White and Black in ELS:2002 would have marked White or Black in NELS:88, in which only one race was allowed. There are over 700 non-Hispanic more-than-one-race sophomores recorded in the ELS:2002 base-year data set, but the distorting effect on cross-cohort estimation is likely to be greatest for small population subgroups with many claimants to multiple race, such as the American Indian category. Analysts should be cautious, then, about conclusions concerning racial subgroup differences between 1980 and 2004. However one can reasonably compare the dropout rates of more-than-one-race students to other groups in 2004. Note that Hispanic ethnicity, in all studies, took precedence over a racial categorization."}, {"section_title": "A.6.5 Differences of Questionnaire Content", "text": "Despite the intention to preserve a core of comparable items, for many reasons, some questions have changed, while others have been added or dropped. For example, in a section on home resources in the student questionnaire, the question about having a specific place to study was not included in ELS:2002, but ELS:2002 added a question about having access to the Internet. Across the cohorts, questions may be identical in content and format or may differ in A-27 one or more ways: the question, item, or response wording; the order in which response options were presented; the manner in which the data were collected (e.g., categorical response option versus open-ended response fields, instructions to mark one versus mark all that apply); and the population to which the question applies. For this report, items thought to be comparable have been selected, though sometimes with caveats and qualifications.
