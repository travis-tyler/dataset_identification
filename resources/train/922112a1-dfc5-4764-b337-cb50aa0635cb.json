[5] [6] [7] Besides, susceptibility to WMH has a large genetic component, with heritability estimates ranging from 55% to 80%. [8] [9] [10] Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified common genetic variants on chromosome 17q25 associated with WMH. 11, 12 These findings were consistently confirmed in independent studies.

Descriptive statistics of the participants from each discovery cohort are summarized in Table I in the online-only Data Supplement. A summary of variants included in the meta-analysis by chromosome is shown in Table II in the online-only Data Supplement.\nOur primary analysis identified several common and lowfrequency/rare variants associated with WMH (P<6\u00d710 \u22127 ) in the EA and combined samples but not in the AA sample. They include 6 variants at 17q25 (4 common variants are known, and 2 low-frequency variants in MRPL38 at 17q25 are novel) and 3 common variants at 2q33 (Table; Figure 2 ; Figure I in the online-only Data Supplement). No other GWAS loci were significant in our analysis (Results in the online-only Data Supplement). Gene-based analysis showed that MRPL38 was associated with WMH (P<3.6\u00d710 \u22126 ) in the EA and combined samples but not in the AA sample (Table III and Figure II in the online-only Data Supplement). The association was consistent across studies (Table IV in the online-only Data Supplement). However, among all variants aggregated in this gene, the 2 significant variants in the single variant analysis contributed most (Table V in the online-only Data Supplement).\nAdjustment for hypertension status did not meaningfully affect the signals in both single variant and gene-based analysis (Table; Table III in the online-only Data Supplement). When adjusting for rs7214628, the lead known GWAS SNP, 17q25 associations were no longer significant (P>0.05), except those in MRPL38. The 2 low-frequency variants in MRPL38 remained nominally significant, with P value \u22480.001 in the EA sample and 0.006 in the combined sample (Table VI in the online-only Data Supplement). The same trend was Figure 1 .

We tested 9 exome-wide significant variants identified in the discovery sample for replication, which represented 3 independent signals. Thus the significance threshold was set to P<0.017. The results are shown in Table VIII in the online-only Data Supplement. Four known variants in TRIM65, FBF1, and ACOX1 at 17q25 were significant in the 3C-Dijon sample. Two low-frequency variants in MRPL38 at 17q25 and 3 common variants at 2q33 were not significant. However, the direction of the association for these variants was the same between the discovery and replication samples, and meta-analysis of the P values for the discovery and replication samples yielded more significant results for the 2 variants in MRPL38. Test of heterogeneity between discovery and replication samples yielded negative results.\nFunctional predictions for the 9 exome-wide significant variants by SIFT, PolyPhen, and CADD are summarized in Table IX in the online-only Data Supplement. Of note, most 17q25 variants have a scaled CADD score >10, indicating they are predicted to be among the 10% most deleterious variants in the genome. Interestingly, the 2 low-frequency MRPL38 variants have the highest scaled CADD score among our top variants (23.9 and 32 for rs34136221 and rs9191, respectively), meaning that they are among the 1% and 0.1% most deleterious variants, respectively. Moreover, both variants are predicted deleterious by SIFT, and rs9191 is predicted probably damaging by PolyPhen.\nThe expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) results for these top variants from Genotype-Tissue Expression database are summarized in Table X in the online-only Data Supplement. In brief, common variants at 17q25 are significant eQTLs for their nearby genes (FBF1, MRPL38, TRIM47, and TRIM65) in multiple brain tissues. One of the 2 low-frequency variants in MRPL38, rs34136221, acts as a cis-eQTL for TRIM47 in cerebellum (P=1.8\u00d710 "}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In this meta-analysis of association studies between WMH burden and exome chip genotypes in 13 community-based cohorts of stroke/dementia-free adults of EA and AA, we identified both common and low-frequency/rare variants significantly associated with WMH. At the known 17q25 locus, 4 exome-wide significant common variants were identified in our previous GWAS because they were true signals, and the majority of the participants in our exome chip analysis were also included in the previous GWAS. Meanwhile, we showed that the association between the low-frequency nonsynonymous variants in MRPL38 and WMH was partially independent of the known GWAS signal. Although this gene was reported previously for WMH, 12 ,16 the variants identified were mostly common and within the linkage disequilibrium block of the lead GWAS SNP at 17q25. According to the design of exome chip, which focuses on different genomic regions and allele frequency spectrum from those for GWAS, it is unlikely that the overlapping sample used in the current study and previous GWAS contributed to the novel low-frequency variants identified here. We also identified significant association at 2q33. In our previous GWAS, this locus (rs72934505; r 2 >0.96) was only suggestively associated with WMH, 12 though it reached genome-wide significance when combining evidence from an additional GWAS of WMH in stroke patients. 31 We failed to replicate the novel low-frequency variants in MRPL38 at 17q25 or in those genes at 2q33, possibly because of the low-frequency of the variants (MRPL38), the small effect size (2q33), the limited sample size, and the difference in sample selection strategy, phenotypic transformation, or regression model used in the replication samples. Using the 3C-Dijon data, we calculated that we had <15% power to detect association for the 2 low-frequency variants in MRPL38, <7% for the 3 variants at 2q33, comparing to >70% power to detect association for those known variants at 17q25 (TRIM65, FBF1, and ACOX1). However, we confirmed the direction of their effect, and indeed, the improved P values by meta-analyzing the discovery and replication samples, as (gray horizontal line). Two significant loci (17q25 and 2q33) in the EA and combined sample were highlighted in green.\nwell as no evidence of heterogeneity provided additional support for the novel association of MRPL38 variants with WMH (Table VIII in the online-only Data Supplement).\nThe 2 low-frequency variants in MRPL38, rs34136221 and rs9191, are in complete linkage disequilibrium with each other. Both have minor allele frequency of \u22481.6% in our sample, which are consistent with allele frequencies observed in the 1000 Genomes Project. In this study, these low-frequency variants contributed primarily to the significance of the gene-based association of MRPL38, which encodes the mitochondrial 39S ribosomal protein L38 containing 380 amino acids. Both variants are nonsynonymous. The A allele of rs34136221 leads to a change from arginine to tryptophan at position 99 (R99W), and the G allele of rs9191 changes aspartic acid at position 371 to histidine (D371H). These changes are predicted to be deleterious to the protein function by SIFT and CADD (Table IX in the online-only Data Supplement). This protein is an important constituent of the large subunit of mitochondrial ribosomes responsible for assembling mitochondrial DNA-coded proteins essential for oxidative phosphorylation. 32 The L38 protein maintains the core architecture of the large subunit's central protuberance, which interacts with the small subunit and with mitochondrial transfer RNAs bound to the ribosome, and is hence critical for mitochondrial translation. 32 The exact function of MRPL38 is still not clear but, interestingly, the structure of the L38 protein is similar to the PEBPs (phosphatidylethanolamine-binding proteins). PEBPs are identified in numerous tissues and have various functions, including a role in neural development and differentiation, which have been implicated in Alzheimer's disease and gliomas. 33 Evidence is also accumulating that mutated mitochondrial ribosomal protein genes are involved in impaired mitochondrial translation leading to several neurological diseases. 34 For instance, MRPL18, another mitochondrial ribosomal protein gene that was found to be upregulated in active multiple sclerosis lesions, 35 was also differentially expressed in brains of young spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rats and associated with WMH. 16 In addition to the deleterious effect on its encoding protein, rs34136221 also acted as a cis-eQTL for TRIM47 in cerebellum ( Figure  IIIA in the online-only Data Supplement), a gene in which common variants have been associated with WMH in previous GWASs, 11, 12 indicating that this variant may mediate the common effect of TRIM47 on WMH. Taken together, these data provide biological plausibility supporting the role of deleterious nonsynonymous variants in MRPL38 in the pathophysiologic changes in the white matter.\nThree significant common variants at 2q33 are in high linkage disequilibrium with each other (r 2 >0.98) with a minor allele frequency of \u224812% in our sample. rs2351524 is located at the 5\u2032 untranslated region of NBEAL1. This variant was associated with coronary artery disease 36 and is likely to affect transcription factor binding.\n37 NBEAL1 encodes the neurobeachin-like 1 protein, one of 9 BDCPs (Beige and Ch\u00e9diak-Higashi domain-containing proteins). 38 The functions of BDCPs remain largely unknown, but BDCP gene mutations may affect lysosome size, apoptosis, autophagy, granule size, or synapse formation. 39 Though NBEAL1 is the least studied and understood BDCP, its coding gene is highly expressed in brain and upregulated in glioma. 38 The association of an NBEAL1 variant reported here is in line with our previous observation that many loci significantly associated with WMH contain variants in genes implicated in malignant brain tumors of the white matter that involve glial cells and further suggests that the genetic pathway may be shared between WMH in aging and glioma, perhaps, through glial cell activation or oxidative DNA damage. 40 rs72932557 is a nonsynonymous SNP in CARF. This gene encodes a calcium-responsive transcription factor, a DNA-binding protein that modulates the transcription of BDNF (brainderived neurotrophic factor). 41 BDNF is a nerve growth factor that promotes neuronal survival in the adult brain, and a BDNF polymorphism has been associated with WMH in healthy elderly population. 42 Animal studies have shown that knockdown of Carf reduced cortical BDNF expression and impaired memory. 43 Whether the observed association of the CARF variant with WMH is direct or through its effect on BDNF remains to be tested. The recent finding that astrocyte-derived BDNF may promote oligodendrogenesis and recovery from white matter damage is consistent with such a hypothesis. 44 rs35212307 is a nonsynonymous SNP in WDR12 (ribosome biogenesis protein WDR12). This gene encodes the WD repeat domain 12, a component of the PeBoW complex required for ribosome biogenesis. 45 Variants in WDR12 have been identified in GWAS of early myocardial infarction 46 and coronary artery disease 47 and have been associated with carotid intima-media thickness. 48 The relationship between carotid atherosclerosis and WMH has long been reported. 49 In a recent meta-analysis of 10 population-based studies, carotid atherosclerosis was strongly associated with the presence of WMH (odds ratio, 1.42; P<0.0001), 50 suggesting a possible role of WDR12 on WMH through atherosclerosis. However, this hypothesis was not supported by a recent large meta-analysis of >50 000 participants with carotid intima-media thickness, in which exome chip variants in WDR12 were not significant. 51 In the eQTL analysis by Genotype-Tissue Expression, both rs72932557 and rs35212307 were associated with the expression level of ICA1L in frontal cortex ( Figure IIIB in the online-only Data Supplement), a gene suggestively associated with neuroticism. 52 Strengths of our study include the large community-based sample of middle-aged to older adults free from stroke/dementia and the first investigation of low-frequency/rare putatively functional variants in the coding regions of the genome in relation to WMH. Several limitations should be noted. In particular, the use of a rank-based inverse normal transformation of WMH did not allow for meaningful estimates of effect size, although having the advantages of harmonizing measures of WMH taken on different scale among individual studies, as well as maintaining desirable statistical properties of the analytic models for low-frequency/rare variant analysis. It should also be noted that, despite close agreement between visual rating and volumetric measurement of WMH, there are still known discrepancies in certain circumstances. 53 Possible inconsistent definitions of dementia used to filter out participants across studies, as well as presence of correlated small vessel disease traits, such as lacunes and microbleeds may represent sources of heterogeneity in our sample, which may have diminished our power to detect genetic effects. In addition, variants captured by exome chip represent only a fraction of the genetic diversity of the genome; we were unable to examine even rarer variants or those that lie outside the coding regions. Whole genome sequencing can provide a more comprehensive view of the genome. Recently, an initial WGS effort for brain imaging traits was made in the Framingham Heart Study, in which the investigators identified an independent common signal at 17q25 (rs9889965) associated with WMH volume. 54 Intriguingly, consistent with our novel finding of low-frequency MRPL38 variant (rs34136221), this variant is also an eQTL for TRIM47 in brain tissues, which provides additional evidence for the role of eQTLs in the development of WMH through the expression of TRIM47 involved in glial cell activation. The WGS study also identified 2 novel loci. Although confirmation of these loci in additional samples is needed, they were not observed in our data (not shown).\nIn conclusion, in this exome chip analysis of >20 000 stroke/dementia-free individuals of EA or AA, we identified low-frequency nonsynonymous variants in MRPL38 at 17q25 associated with WMH partially independently of known common signals. In addition, we showed that common variants at 2q33, a previous suggestive locus in stroke-free populations, reached exome-wide significance in our analysis. Functional annotation provides further support for a role of pathways involved in glial cell activation and oxidative damage, possibly common to WMH and glioma. Larger replication and experimental follow-up are essential to confirm our findings and uncover the biological causal mechanisms of age-related WMH and, thus, to provide a foundation for identifying targets for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention."}, {"section_title": "Sources of Funding", "text": "This study was supported in part through the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke grant R01NS087541 and the National Institute on Aging (NIA) grant U01AG049506.
