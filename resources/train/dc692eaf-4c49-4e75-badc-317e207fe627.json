In AD, increased WMH volume contributes to cognitive decline independently from abnormally high levels of Ab in the brain [2] . These studies suggest that WMHs are an important factor that exacerbates the cognitive deficits in AD.\nThe contribution of WMH to the impairment of functional networks underlying cognitive changes, however, is not well understood. Most studies assessing the effects of WMH on functional brain changes in AD have focused on fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) [3] [4] [5] [6] . Results from these studies showed that higher global WMH volume, measured within the whole white matter, is associated primarily with prefrontal FDG-PET hypometabolism [6] [7] [8] [9] . Higher WMH volume has further been shown to be associated with lower FDG-PET in temporoparietal brain areas in subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD dementia [4] . Such effects of WMH remained when controlling for biomarker levels of Ab [4, 8] . A recent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) study showed that higher WMH burden is associated with impaired brain function [10] . However, these studies used global measures of WMH volume averaged across the entire white matter [4, [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] or large brain regions regardless of anatomical boundaries of fiber tracts [11] .\nRecent studies on ischemic WMH have highlighted the relevance of lesion location and of anatomical connections between WMH and cortical gray matter [12] [13] [14] . By studying patients with genetically defined small vessel disease, we recently demonstrated that white matter lesions are associated with local gray matter atrophy specifically in projection areas of the connecting fiber tracts [15] . Applied to AD, we hypothesized that higher WMH volume in anatomically defined white matter tracts is associated with functional brain changes specifically in connected cortical regions.\nTo test this hypothesis, we measured the effect of WMH and levels of AV-45 positron emission tomography (PET) binding of Ab on functional connectivity (FC) within the default mode network (DMN), which can be readily identified during rsfMRI in older subjects [16] . We focused on FC changes within the DMN because this is the major functional neural network that shows reduced FC in AD and for which the fiber tract connections between different DMN regions have been demonstrated [17, 18] . Specifically, we tested whether WMH in major fiber tract atlas ROIs of the DMN are associated with reduced FC in cortical regions connected by these fiber tracts."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects", "text": "All subjects were recruited within the multicenter network Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI, recruitment phases GO and II) [19] . ADNI is a longitudinal study started in 2003 as a public-private partnership to investigate neuroimaging features, neuropsychological parameters, and other biomarker for tracking and predicting AD-related cerebral and cognitive changes [19] (Supplementary Methods 1). Ethical approval was obtained by the ADNI investigators (http://www.adni-info.org/pdfs/ adni_protocol_9_19_08.pdf). This study was approved by the institutional review boards of all the participating institutions within ADNI.\nAD dementia was diagnosed according to the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) criteria [20] , and amnestic MCI (aMCI) was diagnosed according to the Mayo Clinic criteria [21, 22] (for details, see Supplementary Methods 2). Subjects were selected by the following criteria: availability of an AV-45 PET scan (to assess levels of Ab), three-dimensional (3D) T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan (for spatial normalization), fluidattenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) scan (to assess WMH), and rsfMRI (to assess FC). In addition, MCI and AD dementia patients had to show abnormally high global AV-45 PET binding (Ab1) as defined by a previously established criterion of gAV-45 PET . 1.11 [23] . The different imaging modalities were acquired no longer than 13 months apart from each other (average delay between AV-45 PET and MRI scans was 20 days, range 5 2357 to 378 days).\nOf the initial sample of N 5 138 subjects meeting our criteria, 36 subjects were excluded due to poor signal in rsfMRI as a consequence of atrophy in parietal and frontal regions (N 5 18), FLAIR segmentation failures (N 5 2), excessive movement artifacts visible in rsfMRI (translations . 3 mm or rotations . 2 ) or FLAIR scans (N 5 8), or failed spatial normalization (N 5 8). Failed spatial normalization resulted from large ventricles that caused an erroneous high-dimensional spatial transformation (for details of spatial normalization, see Section 2.4).

Next, the motion parameters and the BOLD signal time courses within the white matter and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were regressed out. The BOLD signal was low-pass filtered (,0.1 Hz) and detrended. These preprocessing steps were conducted with the software program Resting-State fMRI Data Analysis Toolkit (REST) [25] . Based on these preprocessed scans in Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space (1.5 mm), a groupwise independent component analysis (ICA) was conducted, using the GIFT fMRI Toolbox (version 2.0.b) [26] to extract the DMN component. The global brain signal was removed, and a total of 20 independent components were estimated across subjects, using the Infomax algorithm.

WMH was segmented from the whole brain FLAIR images, using a semiautomatic classification procedure. In the first step, FLAIR images were bias-corrected and segmented into three-tissue probability maps using the FAST toolbox [28] from the FMRIB software library [29] (FSL, version v5.0). As a result, for all subjects, WMH and CSF were mixed in the same tissue probability map that was thresholded at a probability .0.3. Given that these two tissue types have nonoverlapping FLAIR intensities distributions (WMH being very bright and CSF very dark), WMH could be unambiguously segregated. This was done using a histogram segmentation based on the Otsu method [30] . Two independent raters manually edited the resulting WMH segmentations to remove clusters that were misclassified as WMH ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ). Manual editing was done using a custom written software tool, developed in MATLAB (R2013b; MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA). The inter-rater reliability of the WMH assessment yielded a Dice coefficient of 0.98.\nThe resulting WMH maps in native space were then normalized to MNI space (2 mm) by a two-step procedure. First, the FLAIR images were registered (affine) to the MPRAGE T1-weighted images using FSL FLIRT [31] . Second, normalization to MNI space (2 mm) was estimated based on the T1-weighted MRI sequence using linear (FSL FLIRT) and nonlinear (FSL FNIRT) registration with standard parameters. The WMH maps were spatially normalized, by applying the transformation parameters estimated in this two-step procedure. Tract-specific WMH volumes were then calculated by superimposing the spatially normalized WMH maps onto the Johns Hopkins University International Consortium for Brain Mapping probabilistic fiber tract atlas (JHU-ICBM-tracts) [32] in the MNI152 standard space. The atlas was comprised of probability maps for 20 main fiber tracts. In order to calculate the WMH volume for a particular fiber tract, the WMH map was overlaid on the corresponding probability map and used as a mask. The voxel-wise probabilities were then summed up across all voxels within this mask. Finally, the tract-specific WMH volumes were normalized to the tracts' total volumes, calculated as the sum of voxel-wise fiber tract probabilities (from the JHU-ICBM-tracts) throughout the whole brain. This procedure has been described previously [33] ."}, {"section_title": "Mapping DMN regions connected by the atlas-based fiber tract ROIs", "text": "The initial set of fiber tracts was based on previous reports of fiber tract connections between DMN brain regions [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] and included the cingulum (CING), cingulumhippocampus tract (CING-Hippo), superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) and its temporal cortex branch (SLFTemp), inferior longitudinal fasciculus, and the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF). For the present study, we did not include forceps minor and forceps major [37, 41] because these interhemispheric fibers connect midline structures that are not clearly separable between hemispheres within resting-state ICA component images (left and right posterior cingulate cortices connected by the forceps major and left and right medial frontal cortices connected by the forceps minor). Next, we determined those tracts that could be confirmed to connect DMN brain regions based on an atlas-based ROI approach. The selected fiber tracts were identified within the probabilistic JHU fiber tract ROI atlas, and the connected brain areas in the DMN were determined as illustrated in Fig. 1 . In the first step, a previously published DMN map [27] was binarized at a threshold of z . 3, except for the hippocampus region that was thresholded at z . 2 to account for typically lower reliability of FC between the hippocampus and other DMN brain regions [42] . The DMN mask was subsequently multiplied by a binary gray matter mask. The gray matter mask was produced by averaging the gray matter probability maps from the SPM-based segmentation (in MNI space) across subjects and thresholding at a gray matter probability score .0.3. The thus produced DMN mask was superimposed onto the JHU fiber tract atlas in MNI space (Fig. 1B) . In the second step, the selected tracts in the probabilistic JHU fiber tract atlas [38] were binarized at 10% probability and dilated by 6 mm. The intersection between the dilated fiber tracts and the DMN mask defined then the tract's cortical projection area (Fig. 1C) . To provide larger coverage of the projection area within the DMN, the intersecting region was dilated by another 6 mm within the boundaries of the DMN mask, thus yielding the final DMN ROI for a particular tract (Fig. 1D) . The ROI was used to extract the mean ROI value from a subject's DMN map for each tract, which was then analyzed in relation to the WMH volume within the same tract (Fig. 1E) , calculated as described previously. The maps of all finally selected fiber tract ROIs and associated gray matter ROI are presented in Fig. 2 (see also Supplementary Table 1) .\nFor an additional analysis, the definition of ROIs was repeated using the same procedure, but a DMN template generated from the group ICA within the present study sample was used this time. The maps of all fiber tracts and associated gray matter ROIs resulting from that modified procedure can be found in Supplementary Fig. 3 ."}, {"section_title": "Signal-to-noise ratio of rsfMRI", "text": "To control for the variability in fMRI BOLD signal due to field inhomogeneities in T2*-weighted scans [43] , we calculated the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) within each ROI.

Normal distribution of gAV-45 PET, WMHr, and FC values was tested in Ab1 subjects, using In the first step, the DMN mask (blue) obtained from a previously published DMN template [27] and the fiber tract mask (red) obtained from the probabilistic JHU fiber tract atlas [32] are fused in MNI space (B). Next, the fiber tract was dilated by 6 mm (meshed red) to determine the area of spatial overlap between the tract and the DMN mask (green, [C]). The green area was dilated in another iteration by 6 mm within the boundaries of the DMN, thus yielding a larger projection area of the fiber tract within the DMN (white arrows pointing to extended green area outside the red meshed sphere, D). This was done to ensure sufficient coverage of the DMN for a representative sampling of DMN FC values within the projection area of the tract. Finally, the spatially normalized WMH map (yellow) was superimposed onto the fiber tract, and the WMH volume within the fiber tract was calculated (E). the Shapiro-Wilk test. The WMHr values were not normally distributed (P , .05) and were therefore log transformed.\nTo control for the influence of potentially confounding variables, we tested for each fiber tract if the independent variables WMHr and gAV-45 PET were associated with any of the demographic variables including age, education, or gender. Only the variable \"age\" showed an association with WMHr (P , .05). Therefore, each subject's WMHr score was subsequently adjusted for the influence of age, based on the regression coefficient of age estimated in the HC Ab2 group.\nFor each fiber tract, nonparametric robust regression analyses (Huber-M) were computed, with FC within the tract's gray matter ROI as the dependent variable. The independent variables included WMHr, gAV-45 PET, diagnosis (HC Ab1, MCI Ab1, and AD dementia), and SNR (within the connected ROI). We controlled for SNR because rsfMRI scans showed in most cases pencil-shaped patterns of SNR. Gender was included as an additional variable due to numerical (although not significant) difference between diagnostic groups. Improvements in model fit by adding two-way interaction terms of diagnosis ! WMHr or WMHr ! AV-45 PET were tested. The normal distribution of the residuals was examined for each significant regression model, using the Shapiro-Wilk test. The significance threshold was a , 0.05 (one-tailed) for testing our directional hypotheses of the effect of WMHr and gAV-45 PET on FC. To test the robustness of findings, we bootstrapped the regression analysis, with the coefficient of WMHr and AV-45 PET being estimated in N 5 999 bootstrap iterations. We report the mean bootstrapped beta coefficient and the 95% confidence interval (95% CI).\nVoxel-based lesion probability mapping of WMH was done based on the binarized WMH maps within the entire sample (AD dementia, MCI Ab1, and HC Ab1) [44] . All statistical analyses were done with the software library R. Table 3 ). In addition, we tested whether GM volume within each fiber tracts' connected brain area is a confounding factor. However, no associations between GM volume and WMHr for any of the fiber Supplementary Fig. 4 ), when spatially defining the DMN regions by the group-specific DMN map rather than the a priori selected DMN mask [27] . None of the two-way interactions (WMHr ! diagnosis or WMHr ! gAV-45 PET) were significant. To test whether global WMHr (excluding WMHr of the IFOF) added to the prediction of FC changes, we added both IFOF-WMHr and global WMHr (excluding WMHr of the IFOF) in a stepwise forward regression model, controlled for age, gender, education, and diagnosis. Results showed that only WMHr of the IFOF was predictive of FC (b 5 26.26, t 5 22.312, P 5 .012)."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Distribution of WMH within the DMN tracts", "text": "Next, we investigated whether WMHr differed between fiber tracts of the DMN or whether WMHs were rather homogenously distributed within the DMN.

WMH probability mapping showed that WMHs were predominantly distributed around posterior and anterior periventricular regions (Fig. 5) , which include pathways of the IFOF and SLF tracts within the DMN.

Because none of the atlas-based fiber tract ROIs of the DMN-connected regions of those two restingstate networks, we did not expect any correlation between WMHr and FC for those networks. Applying the same spatial ROIs and using the same regression models, we did not find any association between WMHr and FC for any of the fiber tract ROIs."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The major findings of the present study are that: (1) the IFOF showed the highest WMHr among all atlas-based fiber tract ROIs of the DMN, (2) WMHr in the fiber tract ROI of the IFOF was associated with reduced FC in the connected brain regions, (3) the association between higher WMHr and lower FC was independent of gAV45 PET, and (4) higher gAV45 PET was independently associated with reduced FC within DMN areas. These results suggest that WMHr disrupt FC in a fiber tract-specific way and contribute independently from A\u00df pathology to reduced FC within the DMN. The IFOF showed a particularly high WMHr when compared with other fiber tracts of the DMN. The IFOF is a long association tract that passes through the periventricular white matter [45] , that is, the sparsely perfused vascular end zone of perforating arteries [46] . Sparse perfusion of the IFOF may thus explain the high WMH volume of that tract. The current results of selective effects for the IFOF suggest that only at a sufficiently high severity level, WMH volume disrupts FC. Although the interpretation in favor of a threshold effect is tempting, we caution that any smaller effects of WMH in tracts other than the IFOF may have not been detected due to lower statistical power. Thus, the threshold hypothesis of the effect of WMH on FC awaits further confirmation.\nWe found effects of WMH onto FC to be additive to those observed for gAV-45 PET, and no interaction with gAV-45 PET was observed. These results are in keeping with previous studies reporting additive rather than synergistic effects of WMH and global Ab levels on FDG-PET and cognitive function in AD [47] . Moreover, the levels of gAV45 PET were not associated with WMHr in any of the fiber tracts of the DMN, consistent with previous studies that found no association between global levels of WMH and global levels of Ab [2, 48] . Together, these results suggest that WMH and Ab pathology contribute independently to functional changes within the DMN. Still, the absence of an interaction effect reported in many neuroimaging studies should be cautiously interpreted with regard to conclusions about the association between vascular pathology and Ab deposition. WMHs are a radiological surrogate measure of white matter changes of presumed vascular origin, where the sensitivity to detect underlying vascular pathology is unclear [49] . Given that many risk factors of AD such as high blood pressure, hyperlipidemia, or diabetes are associated with vascular pathology [50] [51] [52] , it remains to be clarified whether vascular pathology and primary AD pathology such as Ab are truly independent disease processes.\nThere are several caveats that need to be taken into account when interpreting our results.\nFirst, we did not assess fiber tract connections via diffusion tensor imaging directly but applied an atlas-based fiber tract ROI approach. Although this approach has the advantage of avoiding problems of fiber tracking such as failure due to white matter lesions, the current approach cannot assure that fiber tracts always connected the DMN brain regions. Based on the group ICA map of the DMN, we observed for the SLF fiber tract ROIs a connection to the angular gyrus but not the middle temporal gyrus ( Supplementary Fig. 3 ), which may explain why we did not find an association between WMHr in the SLF and DMN brain regions.\nSecond, we included only subjects with abnormally increased levels of A\u00df. Hence, the observed association between WMH and reduced FC may not necessarily be generalizable to subjects with low levels of Ab. However, because Ab levels are associated with abnormal FC in the DMN particularly at pathologically increased but not low levels of Ab [53] , we specifically chose the present study design for a rigorous test of our hypothesis that WMHs, in addition to Ab pathology, contribute to changes in the DMN. Third, we used only global levels of AV-45 PET binding rather than levels of Ab in the DMN as a predictor of FC changes. We chose the global measure of Ab level because in subjects with abnormally increased levels of Ab, the PET levels of Ab binding are highly correlated between different cortical brain areas. Thus, the average cortical AV-45 PET binding can be considered a valid estimate of the level of Ab deposition within the DMN.\nFourth, the AV-45 PET scans were acquired sometimes months apart from the rsfMRI scan. Previous longitudinal studies have shown a 1% to 2% annual change in global AV-45 PET binding [54] with rather subtle spatial expansion [55] . This variability may have limited the power to detect an association between AV-45 PET and FC changes in the present study.\nLastly, we focused on the DMN rather than other restingstate networks. We specifically chose the DMN because this resting-state network is predominantly affected in AD. Our results provide evidence that even in a resting-state network where Ab accumulation is high and Ab is associated with reduced FC, increased WMHs still add to reduced FC in that network in AD. However, other resting-state networks such as the fronto-parietal attention network [56] may be affected by WMH in AD as well [57] .\nIn conclusion, the current results support the notion of localized effects of WMH on the functional integrity of the DMN. These effects of WMH were independent from the effects of global levels of Ab, suggesting a linear additive contribution of both cerebrovascular-related fiber tract impairment and Ab pathology to functional network alterations. For vascular brain changes, treatment options and preventative interventions are already available. The current approach offers a promising way to pinpoint the effects of cerebrovascular pathology-related impairment of functional networks and thus to potentially serve as an outcome parameter for clinical trials."}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "text": "Data used in preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.ucla.edu).
