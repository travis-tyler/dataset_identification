[{"section_title": "", "text": "International large-scale assessments (ILSAs) are an influential instrument for assessing and evaluating quality and equity across education systems and informing educational policies. The data collected in studies such as the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS) and the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) provide ample opportunity to investigate a broad range of research questions that are most often related to student attainment in specific subjects. In addition, the data enable researchers to examine topics related for instance to the impact of teacher and instructional characteristics on learning and attitudes towards learning, educational inequalities and the effectiveness of school and systemic characteristics (Hopfenbeck et al., 2017) . The internationally comparative context in which these questions can be raised and addressed allows us to advance our understanding of the differences and similarities in the learning and teaching environments across national, cultural and regional settings around the world. But also within national borders ILSAs can contribute to a better understanding of the structures and mechanisms of the education system (Schwippert & Lenkeit, 2012) . This is particularly true in countries where no or only few experience with national assessments exist.\nThe assessment of reading has been at the forefront in ILSAs (e.g. Reading Literacy Study 1990 -1991 PIRLS 2001 -ongoing, PISA 2000 not least because it is seen as one of the most important cultural techniques in our modern world. Reading skills are not only used to acquire knowledge in schools but more importantly are a necessary ability which guides individuals through their whole life (Motiejunaite, Noorani, & Monseur, 2014) . But linguistic patterns, structures and the processes of their acquisition are very different across languages and the assessment of reading in an international context has also triggered critical examinations of the underlying cognitive-psychological concepts associated with the learning processes (Asil & Brown, 2016; Evans & Levinson, 2009; Grisay, Gonzalez, & Monseur, 2009) . Language influences on item difficulties and test results have been documented for subjects such as science as well (e.g. El Masri, Baird, & Graesser, 2016) , but the assessment of abstract mathematical and scientific concepts may overall be less affected by their translation into different languages as their acquisition follows similar cognitive processes. Recent studies have also shown that ILSA data are used more frequently in mathematics and science education research fields than in research for teaching reading and language (Hopfenbeck et al., 2017; Lenkeit, Chan, Hopfenbeck, & Baird, 2015) . With few exceptions, reading research does not seem to utilise ILSA data or publish respective research in subject-specific scientific journals. This seems despite the fact that studies such as PIRLS for example offer a vast amount of information about students' performance in different reading purposes and processes, all of which can be clearly assigned to individual items. As such, research aiming to enhance our understanding of the effects of the teaching environment and instructional approaches on learning and skill development has so far been more influential for the science and mathematics domains than for reading in ILSAs (Caro, Lenkeit, & Kyriakides, 2016) . In this context, reading performance merely seems to provide an international comparative attainment indicator, which is taken relatively independent of its subject focus. This is also reflected in the way the five contributions in this special issue relate to the aspect of reading in their research.\nArticles by Caro, Kyriakides, and Televantou (2018) , Walzebug and Kasper (2018) and Lenkeit, Schwippert, and Knigge (2018) seem to utilise reading performance as a representation of educational attainment that could have been exchanged with performance in another subject. Caro and colleagues (2018) set out to tackle one of the biggest methodological challenges of ILSAs and describe how the studies' design prevents research from drawing causal inferences due to bias that originates in a missing measure of prior attainment. In a creative approach that matches data from PIRLS 2011 in England and prior attainment from a further national assessment (National Pupil Database), they are able to calculate the size and source of bias in the relationships between teachers' instructional approaches and student attainment. Their investigation finds that the effects of teaching strategies are indeed biased when prior attainment is omitted. Having captured the size and source of the bias with England-specific data, they go further to postulate different scenarios for the bias across other education systems. With further research in this methodological area, the approach would make ILSAs more attractive to research fields interested in the structures and mechanisms of teaching and learning but whose research questions often depend on a longitudinal design (e.g. educational effectiveness research).\nWalzebug and Kasper (2018) also address the topic of bias in their examination of the home resources for learning (HRL) scale used in PIRLS 2011. They are challenging the assumptions with which the existing scale was produced by postulating three other theoretically and statistically viable scenarios of its distributional properties. They show that the estimation of educational inequalities differs by the postulated scenarios and plead for more technical transparency when releasing scales with the data and interpreting results. Lenkeit and colleagues (2018) explore how the effects of students' gender, their socio-economic and sociocultural characteristics change in magnitude and composition over time in four European countries (France, Germany, Sweden and the United Kingdom). They use data from five PISA cycles and find that some relationships with educational attainment increase across all countries (e.g. number of books at home), whereas others occur or change within specific national contexts only (e.g. parental education, language use at home). The authors therewith argue for the importance of disaggregating commonly used composite measures of student SES (socio-economic status) in order to assess trends in mediating and moderating effects of multiple disadvantaging characteristics in different national contexts.\nArticles by Shepherd (2018) and Solheim and Lundetrae (2018) focus indeed on language and reading, although not necessarily underlying cognitive processes. Shepherd (2018) examines the effect of exposure to mother-tongue and English instruction on student reading performances in Botswana and South Africa. The author uses the 2011 prePIRLS data and applies propensity score matching techniques to compare two student samples. The paper therewith addresses the challenges of maintaining bilingualism and multilingualism through mother-tongue instruction in schools while encouraging the use of English at the same time -an issue faced by many post-colonial countries. She finds that the earlier and longer students are instructed in their mother tongue, the better their reading performance in the English language prePIRLS assessment. The article represents an insightful evaluation of language policy effects on two linguistically and culturally similar groups of students on each side of the border between South Africa and Botswana. Solheim and Lundetrae (2018) raise the question whether test construction in different international studies can account for varying gender differences in reading attainment for children, adolescents and young adults in the Nordic countries. They show that reading differences seem to be largest for adolescents taking the PISA test but are smallest for young adults in PIAAC.\nThey ask if this means that gender differences decrease with advancing age or if surveys measure different skills. Solheim and Lundetrae (2018) find that while PIRLS, PISA and PIAAC conceptualise reading literacy in similar ways, their operationalisation of the construct and test design is very different indeed. Gender differences across the different age groups and surveys appear -at least to some extent -to be associated with features of the assessment that include text-types (fiction and non-fiction), item format (multiple-choice or constructed item) and aspects of the implementation (classrooms or home administration).\nHowever, ILSAs have limitations by design and they accompany the scholarly work in each article of this special issue. While some authors explicitly address these limitations as their research questions and rationale of their investigation (Caro et al., 2018; Walzebug & Kasper, 2018) , others deal with them in adequate ways and/or as 'quasi natural' caveats of their conceptual and empirical approaches (Lenkeit et al., 2018; Shepherd, 2018; Solheim & Lundetrae, 2018) . In the discussion of this special issue, David Rutkowski (2018) picks up on the broad spectrum of the articles' limitations and champions what he sees as the 'emerging issue for international large scale assessments (ILSAs) more broadly: the need for a focused discussion of the merit and worth of ILSAs in the twenty-first century' . In a convincing argumentation, the discussant argues for a meta-evaluation of ILSAs in order to improve their design and usefulness for a diverse set of participating countries -with the potential prospect that future research with ILSA data may encounter less design-inherent limitations.\nAs such this special issue brings together contributions from different scholarly contexts that address a diverse range of focused topics as well as empirical and conceptual perspectives on research with ILSAs. The discussion takes a much needed meta-perspective on the usefulness of ILSAs for educational research and lets us reflect upon possibilities and opportunities for their improvement."}]
