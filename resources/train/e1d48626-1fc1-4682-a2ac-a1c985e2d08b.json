A1 primarily functions to increase diversity in host-expressed 90", "text": "RNAs in a tissue-specific manner (Smith, 2017) . The RNA binding and catalytic activity of A1 is dependent on the binding of one of two cofactors -A1 complementation factor (ACF) or RBM47 (Fossat et al., 2014; Mehta et al., 2000) -and, in addition to ApoB, edits NF1, eIF4G, and the 3'UTRs of other host mRNAs (Rosenberg et al., 2011; Skuse et al., 1996; Yamanaka et al., 1997) .\nACF binds an 11-nt 'mooring sequence' 3' of the target cytidine residue that partially, but not 95 completely, determines the specificity of the nucleotide target (Backus and Smith, 1991; Blanc et al., 2014; Rosenberg et al., 2011) . A1 deaminates cytidines in the context of 5'-AC-3' with the mooring sequence 4-6 nt downstream of the target and is primarily found in the cytoplasm but can traffic to the nucleus. However, A1 is the exception and not the rule to this family, as most APOBEC proteins are regarded for their ability to deaminate C to dU in ssDNA rather than RNA. 100 AID and AID-like enzymes are an essential component of the adaptative immune system in all jawed vertebrate species (Flajnik and Kasahara, 2010; Rogozin et al., 2007) . In humans, AID drives somatic hypermutation and class-switch recombination in B cells through recruitment of DNA repair enzymes following introduction of dU into immunoglobulin V and C genes (Chaudhuri et al., 2003; Dickerson et al., 2003; Muramatsu et al., 2000; Muramatsu et al., 1999; Pham et al., 2003) . The introduced dU can lead to transitions upon DNA replication or stochastic introduction of insertions or deletions during mismatch repair, leading to the diversity that is needed to expand the antibody repertoire of the host. AID preferentially deaminates in the 5'-WRC-3' context (W = A or T, R = A or G) and is basally present in the 110 cytoplasm but traffics to the nucleus to perform immunoglobulin gene editing.\nA2 has roles in skeletal and cardiac muscle differentiation (Etard et al., 2010; Liao et al., 1999; Sato et al., 2010; Vonica et al., 2011) . Transcripts of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4 gamma 2 (Eif4g2) and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) have been suggested as mRNA 115 targets in A2-overexpressing hepatocytes (Okuyama et al., 2012) . However, transgene expression of A1 in hepatocytes also leads to Eif4g2 editing (Yamanaka et al., 1995; Yamanaka et al., 1997) , so it is unclear if this represents the in vivo function or is an artifact of the overexpression model. A4 was discovered in humans through bioinformatic identification and contains orthologs in other mammals, chickens, and frogs (Rogozin et al., 2005) . The function of 120 the protein is as of yet unknown but expression is upregulated in the testes of mice, leading the authors to suggest a potential role in spermatogenesis. An A4 homolog was recently cloned from chicken cells and showed in vitro antiviral activity against Newcastle disease virus, even though editing of the viral genome was not described . Neither A2 nor A4 have described target sequences. A2 shows a distributed intracellular distribution while the cellular 125 localization of A4 remains poorly characterised."}, {"section_title": "J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f", "text": "The principal activity of the A3 subfamily of proteins is the restriction of viruses and mobile genomic elements, which is covered extensively below. A3A, A3B, A3C, A3D, A3F, and A3H target sequences with a 5'-TC-3' motif, while A3G targets 5'-CC-3'. Recently, McDaniel et al. 130 investigated the relevance of sequence context adjacent to a TC motif and secondary structure elements to A3 activity on DNA oligonucleotides (McDaniel et al., 2020) . Flanking sequence preference varied between subfamily members and within difference structural contexts. In general, A3A, A3F, and A3H preferred A or T flanking the target motif and all members of the subfamily preferred the edited site to be presented outside of defined secondary structure 135 elements. A3A, A3C, and A3H show a broadly distributed intracellular distribution, while A3B is predominantly nuclear, and A3D, A3F, and A3G are primarily localized in the cytoplasm.\nIntriguingly, both A3A and A3G have recently been experimentally shown to edit host mRNAs, with A3A-driven editing in activated innate immune cells and A3G-driven editing in hypoxic 140 natural killer and CD8+ T cells and overexpressing HEK293T cells (Sharma et al., 2016; Sharma et al., 2015; Sharma et al., 2019) . As all A3s have demonstrated RNA binding activity (Salter et al., 2016) , it does open up the intriguing possibility of deamination of RNA in specific cellular contexts by members of the A3 subfamily. Perhaps reflecting the structure dependence of A3meditated editing of DNA oligonucleotides (McDaniel et al., 2020) , it had been shown that 145 editing of host mRNA in activated macrophages and monocytes by A3A occurred preferentially at sites flanked by short palindromic sequences (Sharma et al., 2015) . Using bioinformatic approaches, the authors further demonstrated that 72% of edited sites in monocytes and 67% of edited sites in macrophages were present in the loop of a predicted stem-loop structure. In J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f both cell lines, the most common flanking sequence was an upstream A and a downstream A/G, 150 consistent with context preferences for ssDNA targets (McDaniel et al., 2020) . C was also commonly seen in the -3 position.\nFor the purpose of this article, particular attention will be played to species known to be hosts for coronaviruses -bats and humans -but we draw attention to an extensive review of the 305 activity and characteristics of feline A3s (Zhang et al., 2018) .\nThe complexity of APOBEC expression in bats has recently been revealed (Hayward et al., 2018) .\nWithin the pteropid family, eighteen A3 proteins were identified, of which twelve are single deaminase A3Z1, one is a single deaminase A3Z2, four are composed of a single deaminase of a 310 novel paralog termed 'A3Z2B', and one is a double deaminase of A3Z2B-Z3. Active expression of 13 of these proteins was identified in spleen tissue extracted from a black flying fox. The large expansion of Z1 is particularly unusual as this paralog has been independently lost in the mammalian clades Rodentia, Felidae, and Suidae (domestic and wild pigs) (LaRue et al., 2008)\nThe A3 locus and its evolution in humans compared to other mammals is thoroughly described in M\u00fcnk et al (Munk et al., 2012) (Figure 2c ). A3A-G form the seven A3 proteins in the human A3 locus, and the dual-deaminase proteins form a complicated interrelationship of the A3Z1, A3Z2, and A3Z3 paralogs. The current organization likely arose through as many as 6 gene 320 duplication events. In all known species, there is no evidence for duplication of the A3Z3 gene.\nAPOBEC protein evolution. The long-term evolution of the APOBEC proteins is of particular interest as it may indicate which of the proteins perform essential activities for host survival (and thus show low rates of evolution, referred to as purifying or negative selection) and which 325 may be involved in host-pathogen interactions (and thus show rapid fixation of nonsynonymous mutations, referred to as positive or directional selection). Current evidence for the overall evolutionary trajectory is summarized in Table 1 . When evaluating the evolution of AID using representatives from seven mammalian clades, the protein was shown to be under strict purifying evolution (Munk et al., 2012) . Repeating the analysis for A3Z1, A3Z2, and A3Z2 330 demonstrated multimodal evolution and sliding-window analysis indicated that certain regions of the gene are under purifying selection and others are under positive selection. This multimodal relationship for A1 was also present but to a lesser degree than the A3 paralogs. It is likely that the regions under purifying selection are necessary for the direct function of the protein but the regions under positive selection allow for diversity in targets or are the targets 335 of antagonizing viral proteins. Similar analysis with a more limited subset of clades indicated that A3Z1, A3Z2, and A3Z3 all showed dN/dS ratios greater than 1, consistent with overall positive selection (LaRue et al., 2008) . When comparing whole genes between humans and chimpanzees, AID and A3A were under purifying selection, A3B, A3D, and A3G were under positive selection, and A3F was under positive selection in a sliding window analysis only 340 (Sawyer et al., 2004) . Comparing humans to a broader range of primates, A2 was under purifying selection and A3C was under positive selection in a sliding window analysis. A1 was under purifying selection in whole gene comparisons and positive selection under sliding window, consistent with the multimodal results seen above. Curiously, the sites under positive selection for A3G were not isolated to the regions targeted by the HIV-1 Vif protein as one may 345 expect if the core function of positive selection was to limit retroviral antagonism escape.\nAltogether, the evidence implicates the A3 proteins and potentially some functionality of A1 as being involved in the pathogens arms race and being suitable targets for further investigation in an RNA virus context. al., 2007; Smith et al., 2013) . Consequently, coronaviruses demonstrate a low rate substitution rate and minor differences in sequence diversity despite a genome size of nearly 30,000 bases.\nPotential editing effects of APOBECs on RNA virus genomes is facilitated by the availability of an 365 unprecedentedly large, expertly assembled and curated dataset of SARS-CoV-2 complete genome sequences that has accumulated since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The accuracy of the sequences obtained by a range of NGS technologies, combined with minimal evolutionary diversification in the few months since the start of its global spread provides a J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f unique opportunity to investigate mutational events at very high resolution. All analyses of 370 SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence data report a preponderance of C U transitions in the viral genome. Our early analysis (Simmonds, 2020b) of 1,001 SARS-CoV-2 sequences indicated that 38 -42% of all mutations in the queried datasets were due to C U changes and that the ratio of C U to U C transitions was nearly six times higher than expected. Demonstrating that this was not an artefact of the sequencing or bioinformatics methods used, a parallel analysis of genome. Once duplicate mutations were removed and 12,156 mutational event identified, C U and A G mutations were shown to be the most prevalent single base substitutions.\nHowever, the removal of duplicate mutations may have biased the analysis against detection of 385 independently occurring (homoplastic) C U transitions at context-favored sites, as documented extensively in SARS-CoV-2 mutational analyses (Simmonds, 2020b) . Additionally, a 3.5-fold asymmetry in C U/U C mutations was noted in samples from infected minks that had arisen during its transmission within mink farms in the Netherlands (Oude Munnink et al., 2020) . mutations occurring before fitness selection can be observed and potentially provide a better snapshot of the mutational spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences; for example, mutations that were likely to be lethal were readily identified. The authors state that the most common mutations in their datasets, namely A G and T C, were likely due to the action of 400 adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADARs) while the proportion of C U and G A mutations was greater than that typically seen in the human transcriptome, suggesting an additional mechanism leading to the diversity.\nThe locations of C U transition were loosely associated with the base and structure context of Intriguingly, this extended context compared to the standard preference of several APOBECs for 410 uC was similar to the A3A-driven editing of cellular mRNA sequences (Sharma et al., 2015) and in A3A-mediated mutations in ssDNA templates (Chan et al., 2015) .\nThe other factor appearing to influence site preference in RNA sequences is the context of the target C in surrounding RNA secondary structure elements. Over half of the sites in human 415 mRNA that were edited by A3A were flanked by short palindromic sequences and typically located in the unpaired termini of stem-loops (Sharma et al., 2016) . Supporting this, an analysis of RNA structural contexts of edited sites in SARS-CoV-2 and rubella identified preferential C U mutations in terminal loop compared to stem sequences (Klimczak et al., 2020) , or in predicted paired compared to unpaired regions (Simmonds, 2020a) . 420\nThe occurrence of C U hypermutation in SARS-CoV-2 also has a substantial skewing effect on 480 relative frequencies of non-synonymous (dN -amino acid changing) to synonymous substitutions (dS) occurring during virus evolution. Most viral sequence diversity is generated through fixation of neutral substitution that do not influence the fitness of the virus. These typically are synonymous, and comparative analyses of virus sequence datasets typically reveals low dN/dS ratios indicative of purifying selection, such as the 0.1 ratio found in a dataset of 485\nEbolavirus genome sequences during its recent epidemic spread in Central and West Africa (Simmonds, 2020b) . Contrastingly, the high dN/dS ratio between strains (Simmonds, 2020b; van Dorp et al., 2020) or between SARS-CoV-2 and the most closely related bat sarbecovirus, RaTG13 indicates that much of the sequence diversity in SARS-CoV-2 is driven by mutational mechanisms distinct from a process of random mutation and fixation 490 assumed in models of neutral evolution.

The inhibition of HIV-1 replication through the function of A3D, A3F, A3G, and A3H is the most extensively studied of the viral restriction phenotype of the APOBEC family and has been well reviewed elsewhere (Aydin et al., 2014; Delviks-Frankenberry et al., 2020; Desimmie et al., 2014; Hach\u00e9 et al., 2006; Harris and Dudley, 2015; Xu et al., 2020) . During production of new virions in a productively infected host cell, A3 160 proteins form ribonucleoprotein complexes with HIV-1 RNA and the nucleocapsid domain of the Gag protein. The A3 proteins are subsequently packaged and encapsidated in the mature HIV-1 virions. The major hypermutation events take place during subsequent cellular infection.\nAfter viral entry and uncoating, A3 proteins co-localize with HIV-1 RNA during reverse transcription of nascent negative-strand viral cDNA. This single-stranded cDNA acts as the 165 template for plus-strand genomic DNA synthesis and is highly susceptible to the cytidine deamination activities of the packaged A3 proteins. The C U transitions in the template strand (negative-sense strand) result in G A transitions in the genomic strand (positive-sense strand) (Mangeat et al., 2003) . Many hypermutated proviruses are degraded during or after generation of the cDNA template strand, potentially through a pathway mediated by uracil DNA 170 glycosylase-2, and do not integrate in the host cell genome (Kaiser and Emerman, 2006;  J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Langlois and Neuberger, 2008; Weil et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2007) . A large portion of those proviruses that do successfully integrate are rendered defective due to an abundance of mutated start codons and nonsense mutations in several open reading frames (Bruner et al., 2016; Janini et al., 2001; Kieffer et al., 2005) . 175\nHIV-1 and other retroviruses contain a potent counteractor of APOBEC restriction -the accessory protein viral infectivity factor (Vif). The early 2000s contained a cascade of information regarding the interaction between Vif and A3G (Conticello et al., 2003; Kao et al., 2003; Marin et al., 2003; Mehle et al., 2004a; Mehle et al., 2004b; Sheehy et al., 2002; Sheehy 180 et al., 2003; Stopak et al., 2003; Yu et al., 2003) . Per the current model, Vif recruits an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex composed of Elongin B/C, cullin 5, RING-box subunit 2 (Rbx2), and core-binding factor (CBF\u03b2) to polyubiquitinate A3G, leading to degradation via the host proteasome (Fribourgh et al., 2014; Guo et al., 2014; J\u00e4ger et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2011) . Viflike proteins have been described for other lentiviruses including simian immunodeficiency 185 virus, feline immunodeficiency virus, bovine immunodeficiency virus, jembrana disease virus, visna/maedi virus, and caprine arthritis encephalitis virus (Kristbj\u00f6rnsd\u00f3ttir et al., 2004; Nakano et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2014; Zhao et al., 2019; Zielonka et al., 2010) .\nSpecies-specific spumaretrovirinae, another subfamily of retroviruses, infect a diverse number of mammals and encode the accessory protein Bet, which impairs the activity of A3G through 190 direct binding and sequestration rather than targeted degradation (Jaguva Vasudevan et al., 2013; L\u00f6chelt et al., 2005; Russell et al., 2005) . The presence of APOBEC-antagonism by proteinprotein interactions in lentiviruses that infect diverse placental mammals strongly suggests J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f active antiviral APOBEC activity in these representative species. As an alternative mechanism, human T-Cell leukemia virus (HTLV-1) avoids APOBEC activity simply through exclusion of A3G 195 from the packaged virus (Derse et al., 2007) . The diverse approaches of retroviruses to avoid A3 activity highlight the importance of this subfamily for restricting this class of viruses."}, {"section_title": "Retrotransposons and Mobile Genetic Elements.", "text": "Transposable elements (TEs) are selfish genetic elements that are able to move within the genome via one of two methods (Boeke et 200 al., 1985; Bourque et al., 2018; Rubin et al., 1982) . Class I TEs (retrotransposons) replicate through a \"copy and paste\" mechanism wherein reverse transcription of an RNA intermediate produces a cDNA copy of the genetic element that integrates elsewhere in the genome. Class II TEs (DNA transposons) utilize a \"cut and paste\" mechanism via the activity of an encoded transposase enzyme and do not require RNA intermediaries. The evolution of the human 205 genome has been shaped by mobile genetic elements, and estimates suggest that 46% of it may be comprised of inactivated TEs (Bi\u00e9mont and Vieira, 2006; Lander et al., 2001) . In humans, only a subset of long-interspersed element-1 (LINE-1) retrotransposons and short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs) remain retrotransposition-competent (Brouha et al., 2003; Richardson et al., 2015; Schumann, 2007) . The majority of APOBEC family activity on retroelements has 210 been demonstrated on LINE-1 elements in vitro. A3A inhibits LINE-1 retrotransposition through a deaminase-dependent mechanism (Richardson et al., 2014) while AID, A1, A3B, A3C, and A3F act through a deaminase-independent pathway (Ikeda et al., 2011; MacDuff et al., 2009; Pizarro and Cristofari, 2016) . It has been hypothesized that the massive reduction in active LINE-1 elements in the primate taxon compared to rodentia could be the result of extensive 215 duplication and expansion of the A3 gene (Ostertag and Kazazian, 2001; Schumann, 2007) .\nHowever, analysis of the depletion of A3 targeted sequence motifs in human retroelements only demonstrated the footprint of A3 activity on a subset of endogenous retroviruses and not in LINE-1 or SINE elements (Anwar et al., 2013) . proportion of G A hypermutated genomes (Susp\u00e8ne et al., 2005) . In vitro work has also 225 demonstrated that AID and A1 can edit HBV DNA and HBV DNA and RNA, respectively (Gonzalez et al., 2009; Liang et al., 2013) . Murine A1 (mA1) is canonically expressed in hepatic cells and, in a mouse model of HBV infection, mA1 was shown to edit transgenic HBV genomes (Renard et al., 2010) . The low endogenous expression of AID and A1 in human cells canonically infected with HBV limits the interpretability of their contribution to hypermutation, although 230 AID been shown to be upregulated in human hepatocytes upon infection with hepatitis C virus in vitro (Endo et al., 2007; Seeger and Mason, 2000; Uhl\u00e9n et al., 2015) . Human papillomaviruses (HPV), a family of dsDNA viruses, have also been shown to be edited by A3A, A3C, and A3H in A3-transfected 293T cells (Vartanian et al., 2008) , while overexpressed A3A, but not A3B or A3C, was able to restrict HPV replication in immortalized keratinocytes (Warren 235 et al., 2015b) . Bioinformatic analysis of the HPV genome suggests that the preferred target of A3 enzymes (5'-TC-3') is significantly depleted, consistent with long-term adaptation to J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f infection of A3 expressing tissues (Warren et al., 2015a) . Other DNA viruses shown to be hypermutated by A3 proteins included transfusion-transmitted virus, herpes simplex virus 1, and Epstein-Barr virus (Susp\u00e8ne et al., 2011; Tsuge et al., 2010) . 240 RNA Viruses. Although the first description of APOBEC editing activity was on the cellular ApoB mRNA template, direct evidence of APOBEC-driven deamination in RNA viruses has been problematic to demonstrate. The earliest evidence came in 2005 when the rat A1 homolog was shown to edit HIV-1 RNA in vitro (Bishop et al., 2004) . Recently, it was shown that the 245 restriction of HCoV-NL63, a human-infective alphacoronavirus, by A3C, A3F, and A3H was deaminase-dependent, but, in this case, the authors were unable to demonstrate that this resulted from virus genome editing even after serial passaging of HCoV-NL63 in A3 overexpressing cells (Milewska et al., 2018) . Furthermore, while bioinformatic analysis of a large dataset of human-infective viruses demonstrated significant depletion of A3 target motifs 250 been demonstrated primarily using overexpression models of catalytically inactive A3 mutants. This phenomenon has been reported for many viruses, including HIV-1, measles, mumps, respiratory syncytial virus, HCoV-NL63, adeno-associated virus, enterovirus A71, and minute virus of mice (Chen et al., 2006; Fehrholz et al., 2012; Li et al., 2018; Narvaiza et al., 2009 ). Longinterspersed element 1 is also inhibited by A3B and A3F in a deaminase-independent manner 265 (Stenglein and Harris, 2006) . In HIV-1, the prevailing model for this restriction is binding of genomic RNA inhibiting the initiation of reverse transcription, which may also explain the phenotype in LINE-1. The mechanism in other RNA and DNA viruses is not well described.\nInfluenza virus and vaccinia virus are not restricted by A3 overexpression and appear to avoid targeting through unknown mechanisms (Kremer et al., 2006; Pauli et al., 2009) . 270"}, {"section_title": "APOBEC Origins, Diversification, and Evolution", "text": "Origin. The APOBEC family is related to bacterial, yeast, and plant deaminases all possessing highly conserved amino acid motifs responsible for coordination of zinc in the active site 275 Another recent study identified, cloned, and demonstrated deaminase activity in AID homologs from sea urchins and branchiopods (Liu et al., 2018) . The AID homologs showed increased 280 expression in barrier tissues and were upregulated in response to bacterial challenge, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f suggesting a potential role in antimicrobial defense. Ancestral members of the family at the point of vertebrate speciation include both AID and A2, and homologs of the two proteins have been identified bioinformatically in birds, amphibians, and ray-finned fish (zebrafish and pufferfish), with an AID homolog responsible for diversity in variable lymphocyte receptors of 285 jawless vertebrates (Conticello et al., 2005; Hsu, 2016) . A1 and A3 both arose from independent duplication events of AID (Conticello et al., 2005) . A1 has been identified in birds, reptiles, amphibians, and lungfish, suggesting it arose prior to the tetrapod-lungfish divergence (Krishnan et al., 2018) . A3 emerged from AID duplication in placental mammals and has undergone frequent duplication, fusion, and loss in different branches of the clade (Krishnan et 290 al., 2018; Munk et al., 2012) .\nA3 paralog expansion. A3 homologs are not present in marsupials or monotreme genomes and appear to be exclusive to placental mammals (Ito et al., 2020; Mikkelsen et al., 2007; Warren et al., 2008) . The A3 proteins contains three paralogs (A3Z1, A3Z2, A3Z3) that are designated 295 according to conservation of amino acid residues within the zinc-coordinating domain (LaRue et al., 2009) (Figure 2a ). From the most recent common ancestor of the three A3 paralogs, A3Z3 may be the most ancient having diverged approximately 250 million years ago with A3Z1 and A3Z2 diverging from each other 50 million years later (Munk et al., 2012) . It is hypothesized that the most recent common ancestor of placental mammals contained a gene set of A3Z1-300 A3Z2-A3Z3 that, through multiple processes of differential evolution, have led to the diversity seen in extant species (Figure 2b ).

Apart from the restriction of mutations to C U changes (or G A if the negative-sense strand is edited), sequence changes are also primarily distributed in mutational 470 hotspots that may lead to the appearance of convergent changes between otherwise genetically unlinked strains. For example, several C U mutations occurred independently among variants of SARS-CoV-2 that were distributed into different parts of the tree (Simmonds, 2020b) , and therefore conflicted with relationships reconstructed from phylogenetically informative sites.

For example, the enrichment of U (40%), depletion of C (13%) and intermediate 510 frequencies of A and G bases (28% and 19%) in HCoV-HKU1 has been proposed to have been driven by APOBEC associated mutations (Woo et al., 2007) .

Branch length is not drawn to timescale. Question marks for A4 protein represent a lack of concrete evidence at the divergence of amphibians (Rogozin et al., 2005) and putative evidence in algae species (Krishnan et al., 2018) . Block for A2\nrepresents uncertainty on emergence prior to protostome -deuterostome split. A1 and A3 both arose from duplication of AID. 1105 o The role of base context and secondary structure motifs on APOBEC deamination 1135"}]
