[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "USDA, through its Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) collects detailed information from farm operators on specific loan characteristics such as interest rate, loan term, origination date, type of loan, loan purpose, and type of financing. This information is used to construct portions of the farm sector balance sheet in addition to supporting research on credit use, farm solvency, and debt repayment capacity (Kuethe andMorehart 2012 andHarris et. al, 2009). Information collection for sensitive items, such as debt, is subject to item non-response. Item non-response occurs when not all questions are answered. It represents a special challenge to economic surveys (see for example Barcelo, 2008;Drechsler, 2011;Heeringa, et.al, 200;Kennickell, 1998;and Schenker, et.al, 2006). The reason for a \"do not know\" response is not necessarily the unwillingness to answer. In many cases, it will be lack of knowledge or apprehension. Ignoring item non-response completely, by setting all missing values to zero, or by taking into account only the existing answers; will result in a bias. Under certain conditions, a bias due to item nonresponse can be mitigated or even avoided by imputation, depending on how well item non-response can be explained by observed variables (Rubin, 1996 andSchafer, 2010). Imputation is the practice of filling in missing data with plausible values. Historically, the ARMS has used a generalized cell mean imputation approach for general categories of debt and made no systematic effort to impute the detailed components asked in the debt reporting table. The shortcomings of the current procedures are twofold. First it does not provide for full imputation of all potential debt responses when detailed questions are asked. Secondly, it suffers from the reported drawbacks of univariate imputation approaches as discussed by Rubin and others (Rubin 2009 andReiter andRaghunathan, 2007). Moreover, recent external review of the ARMS program has highlighted the need to explore alternative imputation methods and has identified unexplained differences between ARMS estimates of debt by lender and administrative data (Briggeman, et.al, 2012 andNational Research Council, 2007). Research on ARMS survey methods has also highlighted the need to consider alternative imputation methods (Robbins et.al, 2013 andAhearn et. al, 2011)."}, {"section_title": "Imputation Process", "text": "There were a number of variables that were significantly associated with the incidence of debt and whether or not this information was missing. These associations formed the basis of multiple imputation models, which include covariates of interest to this analysis, as well as other variables previously identified in the literature as being related to use of credit (see for example : Briggeman, 2009;Harris et.al, 2009;and Katchova, 2005). Imputation for the ARMS debt table represents a unique challenge since the data contains a mixture of categorical variables and continuous variables with skewed distributions and a variety of often hierarchical skip patterns and logical constraints. As a result, we apply the fully conditional specification approach, iteratively imputing one variable at a time, conditioning on the other variables available in the dataset as a multi-stage process (Templ, et.al, 2011). Imputation and statistical analysis were performed with SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary NC) and the SAScallable implementation of IVEware (Raghunathan, 2002). For multivariate imputation we rely on four different model specifications. Linear models are used for continuous variables, the logit model is used for binary variables and the multinomial logit for variables with more than two categories, and a two stage (logistic then linear) model is used for mixed variables that are both categorical and continuous. "}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "Imputations can be validated using a reasonability standard by examining the differences between observed and missing values, and the distribution of the completed data as a whole (Abayomi 2008). The outcomes for categorical variables indicate relatively small changes in the distribution across response codes. For example, for loan types (1-3), the share of farms with production loans of one year or less declined by 1.6 percent and the share with non-real estate loans of more than one year went up by 1.8 percent. The share with real estate loans was virtually the same. For continuous variables, such as debt, the consistency after imputation is illustrated by the similarity in the overall distribution and the scatter plot versus total production expenses."}, {"section_title": "Implications", "text": "When summarized across all ARMS versions, multiple imputation can be compared with the mean imputation approach used in the past. The results suggest a $27 billion (17 percent) increase in total debt. Imputation differences were more pronounced for current liabilities (23 percent increase) and non-real estate, non-current liabilities (25 percent increase). Real estate liabilities increased when using multiple imputation by 12 percent. As a result of the increase in debt, estimated equity (the difference between total assets and total debt) declined by less than 2 percent. In addition, debt-to-asset ratio estimates increased across a broad range of producers with the potential of more debt repayment challenges emerging. For farm businesses, the largest increase in debt-to-asset ratios occurred for poultry, hog, and dairy farms where debt was highly concentrated prior to imputation. For the previously un-imputed ARMS version 1 debt table, results show that applying multivariate imputation procedures would increase the estimate of total farm debt by $55 billion; an increase of approximately 40 percent. Increases for major lenders ranged from 24 percent for life insurance companies to almost 70 percent for individuals and others. Coverage relative to lender administrative data improved across all major lenders with the largest gains for Commercial Bank debt, with more than 75 percent of reported loans outstanding captured by ARMS after imputation. 0 20,000,000,000 40,000,000,000 60,000,000,000 80,000,000,000 100,000,000,000 120,000,000,000 140,000,000,000 160,000,000,000 180,000,000,000 200,000,000,000 "}]
