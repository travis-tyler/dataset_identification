Classical genome-wide association (GWA) studies are usually performed by investigating the relationship between multiple genetic variants and candidate phenotypical traits (such as brain regional volumes) by means of independent univariate analysis [2] . These studies typically require very large samples in order to detect meaningful associations, since genetic traits usually account for a small fraction of the phenotype variance. Moreover, since mass univariate testing does not account for potential genegene interactions, it is highly prone to multiple comparison problems, and might lead to underpowered discoveries of significant associations.\nRecent methodological advances in imaging genetics introduce multivariate approaches to capture meaningful This study was funded in part by NIH ENIGMA Center grant U54 EB020403, supported by the Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) Centers of Excellence program, by the NIHR BRC UCLH/UCL High Impact Initiative-BW.mn.BRC10269, by the EU-FP7 project VPH-DARE@IT (FP7-ICT-2011-9-601055), and by the EPSRC grants EP/H046410/1, EP/J020990/1, and EP/K005278.

Although based on different statistical assumptions, most of these approaches rely on simultaneous regression and dimensionality reduction strategies, such as partial least squares (PLS) [4] , or independent component analysis (ICA) [5] . In particular, PLS is an appealing approach due to the parsimonious description of the multivariate correlation patterns, and for the relative simplicity of the implementation [6] . Multivariate models applied to the large dimensional genotype data easily run into overfitting problems, and the generalization of the related findings to unseen data is usually problematic. Even though different cross-validation and regularization strategies have been introduced in order to mitigate this crucial issue, it still remains to be verified whether the findings obtained with high-dimensional multivariate models do generalize to unseen and heterogeneous clinical cohorts.\nIn this work we evaluate the ability of PLS in generalizing to unseen clinical cohorts when applied to the analysis of the joint variation between genotype and phenotype in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The analysis proposed in this work is based on the identification of the meaningful features associated to the largest PLS weights estimated in a cohort of AD and healhty individuals (Section 2), and subsequently validated i) on an ADNI group of subjects affected by mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (Section 5.2.1), and ii) on the ENIGMA cohort [7] composed by very heterogeneous clinical populations (Section 5.2.2).

The phenotype features consist in the individual's regional volumes reported in ADNI1/2 for whole brain, ventricles, and average bilateral hippocampi, enthorinal cortex and mid-temporal lobes. The volumes were normalized by covarying for age, total intracranial volume, and sex, and subsequently standardized by group-wise mean and standard deviation of the healthy and AD individuals.\nThe genotype features consist in the individual's minor allele counts for each of the 1,167,126 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in chromosomes 1 to 22 available in the study. SNP data was downloaded from the ADNI website and preprocessed with plink [9] by filtering SNPs which did not meet the quality control criteria (Minor Allele Frequency (MAF) < 0.01, Genotype Call Rate < 95%, Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium < 1x10 \u2212 6). Finally, the genotyped SNPs passing QC were imputed to the HapMap III reference panel and further QCed to keep only high quality imputed SNPs (i.e. MAF > 0.01 and RSQR > 0.3), and the missing individual SNPs were replaced by the group-wise median.

The analysis of the respective eigen-values showed that these components alone accounted for 60% of the total variation in the data (40% for component 1, and 20% for component 2).\nThe first component of phenotype variation is identified by the anti-correlation between ventricles volume and the volume of the other brain areas (Figure 1) . Figure 2 shows the SNPs with largest absolute weights in the genotype eigen-components, grouped by chromosome location (for each eigen-component we identified 584 SNPs above the 99.95th percentile of the distribution of the absolute weights). The figure reports the percentage of informative SNPs per chromosome identified by the PLS model with respect to the number of SNPs available for each chromosome. We note that chromosome 19 is the most represented among the SNPs identified by eigen-component 1. The second component is characterized by anticorrelation between hippocampal volume and the other brain structures (principally ventricles and entorhinal cortex), while the largest represented chromosomes are the number 7, 15, and 14. The subsequent linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis identified 210 and 232 independent SNPs for respectively component 1 and 2, uniformly distributed across the 22 chromosomes.

In this work the PLS model was trained on 657 ADNI subjects, which represent a tiny fraction (\u223c 5%) of the whole ENIGMA discovery cohort of 13,000 individuals. Although we don't expect a meaningful impact of the ADNI subset on the reported generalization of the PLS model in the ENIGMA cohort (last column of Table 2 ), we cannot exclude that this issue might be a potential source of bias of the resulting statistical result. Importantly, PLS overcomes the classical multiple comparison problem of GWA studies by modeling the joint correlation of SNPs and brain features through the eigencomponents. We note that this work is based on a standard implementation of PLS, as opposed to previously proposed sparse implementations based on the L 1 regularization of the feature weights [4] . However, the posterior analysis proposed in this work focuses on the investigation of the features associated to the top 0.05% PLS weights with respect to the L 1 norm. The proposed approach is thus based on a heuristic penalization of the PLS components, aimed to promote stability and sensitivity of the associated findings."}]
