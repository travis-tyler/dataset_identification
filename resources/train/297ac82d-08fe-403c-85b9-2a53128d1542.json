[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "COVID-19 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 1 . Methods to detect virus, as well as to quantify viral load, are needed for diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines to combat the worldwide spread of this infectious disease. The reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is considered a gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis. However, quantification via RT-qPCR relies on the use of external standards or references, and the results can be variable, with a 20-30% variability reported even within trained laboratories [2] [3] [4] . Thus, an absolute quantification method with improved precision and accuracy is vital for virus research [5] [6] [7] .\nDigital PCR is increasingly being used as a highly accurate and sensitive method for the absolute quantification of nucleic acids 2, [8] [9] [10] . In a digital PCR reaction, the PCR mixture is separated into thousands of individual reactions, resulting in the amplification of either zero or one of the nucleic acid target molecules present in each partition. After independent PCR amplification and endpoint fluorescence detection of each partition, the copy number of the sample is determined based on the proportion of positive partitions. Since the PCR reaction in each partition proceeds independently, absolute quantification by digital PCR is more precise than RT-qPCR and more tolerant of inhibitors; furthermore, digital PCR overcomes poor amplification efficiency 2 .\nThe sensitivity and precision of digital PCR-based viral detection have been demonstrated in quantitative detection and viral load analysis of SARS-CoV-2infected patient samples with a limit of detection (LOD) at ~2 copies/reaction with reduced inter-lab variability and fewer false negatives and fewer false positives compared with RT-PCR 7, [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . Absolute quantification of the virus will lead to less variability between different labs. In addition to its application in viral diagnostics, digital PCR has also been applied to other areas of virus research, including the study of the aerodynamic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 6 and in quantifying residual SARS-CoV-2 load in pulmonary tissues of a patient who tested virus-negative by the nasopharyngeal swab-qPCR test 5 . The main drawback of digital PCR, however, is the relatively long reaction time (~4 hours) needed as a result of the 1-2\u00b0C/s ramp up/down rate for efficient inter-partition heat transfer during thermal cycling, compared to that of qPCR, which requires 1 hour. Reducing the reaction time of digital PCR is therefore crucial in enabling the adoption of the technology for rapid virus detection in hospitals and clinics 17 .\nIsothermal amplification methods, which amplify the nucleic acid target molecule at a constant temperature and thereby reduce the reaction time, have also been used for viral detection. These include methods that employ recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) or loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . More recently, innovative diagnostic methods using RNA-guided CRISPR/Cas system have been developed to detect nucleic acids. In the RNA-guided CRISPR/Cas system, Cas effectors such as Cas12a, Cas12b and Cas13a are exploited for their collateral cleavage activity, which refers to the degradation of other nonspecific DNA/RNA oligos such as fluorescently-tagged reporter oligos, once the Cas protein finds and cleaves a specific DNA/RNA target 24, 25 . By combining RPA-or LAMP-mediated isothermal amplification of the target molecule with the CRISPR/Cas biosensing system, methods such as SHERLOCK and DETECTR have detected dengue virus and human papillomavirus, as well as SARS-CoV-2, in clinical samples [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] . However, as CRISPR-based methods are not quantitative and require multiple manipulations between the amplification and detection steps, there remains a need for a quantitative, rapid, and robust viral detection method.\nHere, we report the development of a digital CRISPR method for the rapid, sensitive, and specific detection of viral nucleic acids at a constant temperature. This method combines the advantages of quantitative digital PCR, rapid isothermal amplification, and specific CRISPR detection into a one-pot reaction system that partitions the individual reactions into 10,000 compartments on a commercial high-density chip. In this study, we demonstrate an optimized digital CRISPR method that allows for absolute quantification of viral nucleic acids at a constant temperature in one hour. We validated this method using DNA containing the N (nucleoprotein) gene of SARS-CoV-2 and showed a linear signal-to-input response of R 2 value > 0.99. We compared our digital CRISPR detection system against the traditional digital PCR method and show that the digital CRISPR system (1h vs 4h) was faster and had sensitivity and accuracy comparable to that of traditional digital PCR. Also, this method is highly specific and do not have cross activity on other similar coronavirus. Furthermore, the absolute quantification results of this method are not influenced by 4000 copies of human background DNA. We also used digital CRISPR in the absolute quantification of Epstein-Barr virus from human B cells (R 2 value > 0.98). Our rapid and sensitive digital CRISPR method allows for the accurate detection and absolute quantification of viral nucleic acids."}, {"section_title": "Design of digital CRISPR method", "text": "Commercial chips for sample partitioning and matched fluorescence reader for endpoint detection were used in digital CRISPR 33 . In this system, each CRISPR-based reaction mix is sub-divided into 10,000 partitions on the chip, resulting in an average partition volume of 1.336 nL. We first optimized the bulk CRISPR reaction to achieve a one-copy-per-1.336 nL partition detection sensitivity on the chip. This is equivalent to femtomolar detection sensitivity in a bulk reaction. We selected the Cas12a homolog from Lachnospiraceae bacterium ND2006 (LbCas12a) as it showed the highest signal-to-noise ratio relative to other Cas12a homologs from a previous study 27 . To test if the digital CRISPR method could detect viral DNA with femtomolar sensitivity without preamplification, serially-diluted dsDNA (double stranded DNA) was incubated with LbCas12a together with its CRISPR RNA (crRNA) and a reporter (quenched fluorescent DNA). The sensitivity of detection using the CRISPRbased method without pre-amplification in a bulk reaction was found to be 10 pM (Figure. S1), which did not meet the femtomolar sensitivity requirement of digital CRISPR.\nTo increase the sensitivity of detection of the CRISPR-based method, an isothermal amplification step was used. RPA was chosen for the isothermal amplification step because its reaction temperature (25\u00b0C to 42\u00b0C) is compatible with that of Cas12a (25\u00b0C to 48\u00b0C). This allowed for a one-step RPA-digital CRISPR absolute quantification method that eliminates multiple manipulations inherent in two-step CRISPR-based detection methods such as SHERLOCK and DETECTR 24, 25 . To avoid Cas12a-mediated cleavage of the target molecule before amplification, we designed the crRNA to target singlestranded DNA (ssDNA) that is generated only after amplification of the target molecule ( Figure 1B) 32 . Another advantage of this method is the ease of designing ssDNA-targeting crRNA over traditional dsDNA-targeting crRNA, because the nuclease activity of Cas12a on ssDNA has been reported to be independent of the presence of protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) 34 .\nThe digital CRISPR method developed in this study is illustrated in Figure 1A . Extracted DNA samples are loaded onto on the chip by capillary action, and the reaction is partitioned into 10,000 compartments, resulting in zero or one target molecule in each compartment. To prevent spontaneous target amplification by RPA at room temperature 35 , the RPA-CRISPR reaction was prepared without the addition of Mg 2+ , which is required for the polymerase activity. All reactions were prepared on ice and samples were loaded within one minute to prevent premature target amplification. The partitioned reactions were incubated in isothermal water baths, heat blocks, or warm rooms. In each compartment containing the target molecule ( Figure 1B) , RPA initiates from one DNA strand and subsequently exposes the crRNA-targeted ssDNA region on the other strand. As the amplification proceeds, Cas12a cleaves the positive ssDNA strand, triggering its collateral cleavage activity, which in turn cleaves the proximal quenched fluorescent probe (ssDNA-FQ reporter) to generate a fluorescence signal. At the same time, ongoing amplification of the other DNA strand exponentially amplifies the target DNA, triggering more Cas12a activation and increasing the fluorescence readout. The proportion of positiveto-negative compartments is analyzed based on the endpoint fluorescence measurement, and the copy number of the target nucleic acid is calculated based on the Poisson distribution, allowing for absolute quantification of the sample ( Figure 1A ). Concurrent detection of compartments in each tube by the Clarity\u2122 Reader shortens detection time to within minutes. In each partition, the DNA is amplified by RPA and detected by Cas12a-crRNA, resulting in a fluorescent signal in the partition. Based on the proportion of positive partitions and on Poisson distribution, the absolute copy number of the nucleic acid target is quantified. B. Illustration of RPA-Cas12a reaction in each positive partition. In each partition containing the target nucleic acid, the primers bind to the target nucleic acid and initiate amplification with the aid of recombinase and DNA polymerase. Because of the strand displacement of DNA polymerase, the exposed crRNA-targeted ssDNA sites are bound by Cas12a-crRNA complexes. Cas12a is then activated and cleaves the nearby FQ reporters to produce a fluorescence readout."}, {"section_title": "Digital CRISPR method optimization", "text": "To validate and optimize the digital CRISPR method, G-block DNA or plasmids containing the SARS-CoV-2 N (nucleoprotein) gene region were used and primers and crRNAs specific for the SARS-CoV-2 N gene were designed accordingly based on previous studies 32 . The target regions overlap with those of the China CDC assay (N gene region) with some modification to meet the primer and crRNA design (Table S1 ). To optimize the Cas12a-mediated reaction, a bulk reaction using 0.1 nM and 1 nM dsDNA as a target was performed with a range of Cas12a/crRNA concentrations. We found that in the presence of a constant amount of target DNA and probe, comparable fluorescence signal intensities were detected between 50 nM to 250 nM Cas12a-crRNA concentrations, suggesting that changing the Cas12a/crRNA concentration did not influence the reaction ( Figure S2 ).\nSince the quenched fluorescent probe is another key component that influences the reaction, we optimized the FQ assay by incubating increasing amounts of FQ probes with constant concentrations of Cas12a-crRNA and target DNA. As expected, CRISPR-mediated fluorescence signal intensities increased with increasing amounts of FQ probes (from 250 nM to 5 \u00b5M), although higher probe concentrations also resulted in higher background noise (Figure 2A , 2B). At FQ probe concentrations above 5 \u00b5M, the signal-to-noise ratio could not be further enhanced ( Figure 2B ). To ensure that the fluorescence signal generated on the partitioned chip was within the reader's detection range, different FQ probe concentrations were tested in independent digital CRISPR reactions in the presence of the target DNA and the fluorescence measured on the digital PCR fluorescence reader. We found that in the presence of the same target DNA, the proportions of positive partitions were comparable regardless of the FQ probe concentration used ( Figure 2D ). However, only the background noise and positive signals generated in the reaction with 500 nM FQ probe concentration were within the reader's detection range, while the reactions containing 1000 nM FQ probe concentration yielded higher background noises, which are difficult to separate from positive signals ( Figure 2C ). We therefore used 500 nM FQ probe concentrations to achieve high signal-to-noise ratios for subsequent experiments.\nAll rights reserved.

We performed the bulk reaction at 25\u00b0C, 37\u00b0C and 42\u00b0C, which are temperatures within the reaction temperature ranges of RPA (25\u00b0C to 42\u00b0C) and Cas12a (25\u00b0C to 48\u00b0C). First, we tested the reaction using serial dilutions of plasmid DNA at 25\u00b0C and 42\u00b0C. The reaction proceeded at both of these reaction temperatures, with a limit of detection of about 9.4 copies/\u00b5L. However, at 25\u00b0C, the reaction proceeded significantly All rights reserved.

S3 ). Next, we assessed the effect of different temperatures (25\u00b0C, 37\u00b0C and 42\u00b0C) on reactions containing a constant amount of plasmid DNA (37.5 copies/\u00b5L). We found that higher temperatures accelerated the reaction ( Figure S3C ). Taken together, our results suggest that 42\u00b0C is the optimal temperature for the RPA-Cas12a reaction.\nWe next investigated whether the reaction time affected the precision of digital CRISPR on plasmid DNA detection at 42\u00b0C. As shown in Figure 3A , the reaction proceeded quickly with some fluorescence signal detected in several compartments at 20 min, but with a low signal-to-noise ratio at this time point. As the reaction proceeded, two distinct peaks indicating the negative (left) and positive (right) partitions were detected at 40 min ( Figure 3A) . Analysis of the ratio of positive partitions on the chip at the different time points revealed that the number of positive partitions reached a plateau after 60 min in all four replicates, suggesting that 60 min was the earliest end-point measurement ( Figure 3B ). All subsequent experiments were therefore performed for 60 minutes. perpetuity. preprint (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in The copyright holder for this this version posted November 4, 2020. ; and the right peak shifts further to the right.

In this assay, linearized plasmid containing the SARS-CoV-2 N gene was serially diluted and used as the target DNA in the aforementioned optimized digital CRISPR or digital PCR reactions. Using digital CRISPR-based detection, a proportional increase in the number of positive partitions was observed with increasing concentrations of the target DNA ( Figure. 4A), indicating the good quantitative performance of digital CRISPR. Although few partitions in the negative control were classified as having a positive signal due to non-specific amplification, the average of 10 negative control replicates give us an average of 0.165 copies/\u00b5L readout and the limit of blank (LoB) is 0.413 copies/\u00b5L, which is about half of our limit of detection (LoD), 0.897 copies/\u00b5L ( Figure 4A , Table  S2 ).\nTo test the robustness and reproducibility of the digital CRISPR assay, at least ten independent digital CRISPR reactions using the SARS-CoV-2 N gene as the target DNA were performed on different days. The coefficient of variation (CV) observed for most samples was \u226415% except for the lowest dilution (0.6 copies/\u00b5L), indicating the limit of quantification (LoQ) of this method is around 2.2 copies/\u00b5L of the viral genome (Table S2) . To assess the accuracy of digital CRISPR-based nucleic acid detection against that of digital PCR, DNA concentrations measured by digital CRISPR were plotted against the corresponding DNA concentrations obtained by digital PCR. Linear regression analysis revealed an R 2 value of above 0.99 across a dynamic range from 0.6 to 2027 copies/\u00b5L, suggesting that our digital CRISPR method was reliable for the absolute quantification of nucleic acids (Figure. 4B) . These data highlight the sensitivity, accuracy, and speed of the digital CRISPR-based detection method developed in this study for the absolute quantification of nucleic acids in samples with LoD at 0.897 copies/\u00b5L and LoQ at 2.2 copies/\u00b5L.

However, conformational changes in supercoiled DNA have been reported to have a profound effect on PCR-based quantification [36] [37] [38] . Unsuccessful single-molecule amplification of non-linearized plasmids was reported in a PCR-based study, which resulted in an underestimation for circular plasmid quantification on some dPCR machines 39, 40 . To test whether plasmid conformation also affects the accuracy of digital CRISPR, undigested plasmid containing the SARS-CoV-2 N gene was serially diluted and used for digital PCR or digital CRISPR reactions. Concentrations of non-linearized plasmids measured by digital PCR were about half of those detected for linearized plasmids (regression coefficients at 0.5261) ( Figure 5D ), which is in accordance with previous studies and indicates that the accuracy of digital PCR is influenced by plasmid conformation. Compared to digital PCR, digital CRISPR-based detection showed higher amplification efficiency of the supercoiled plasmid DNA, as evidenced by the higher positive compartments ratio detected ( Figure 5A, B) . Digital CRISPR-based concentrations of nonlinearized plasmids were highly concordant with those of linearized plasmids (regression coefficients at 1.0673) ( Figure 5C ), suggesting that the accuracy of digital CRISPR is not affected by plasmid conformation.\nAll rights reserved.

The performance characteristics of this method were validated using SARS-CoV-2 synthetic DNA and EBV DNA, and compared to those of absolute quantification digital PCR method, the current gold standard. Our digital CRISPR-based method achieved sensitivity and detection limits (LoD 0.897 copy/\u00b5L) comparable with those of qPCR and other isothermal methods, such as SHERLOCK and DETECTR (Table S3 ). The significant advantage of our digital CRISPR method over the other detection methods is its speed: our digital CRISPR method can perform absolute quantification rapidly within an hour, which is four times faster than current digital PCR-based detection.\nAbsolute quantification for viral detection could not only facilitate clinical processing but also benefit research. Viral loads closely parallel transmission risk and disease severity. High SARS-CoV-2 viral loads have been reported to correlate with the course of infection and mortality 7, [45] [46] [47] [48] . These reports underscore the urgent need for rapid and sensitive virus detection and quantification methods to monitor viral load as the basis for clinical decision making. Such methods are also needed for mechanistic studies, transmission studies, vaccine development, and therapeutics for COVID-19. Although there currently exist many diagnostic methods available for virus detection, these methods usually do not allow for a rapid and precise quantification of the viral load (Table S3 ).\nOur digital CRISPR-based method reported in the study is four times faster than the traditional digital PCR-based methods used for the absolute quantification of nucleic acids. Additionally, the isothermal feature of our digital CRISPRbased detection assay confers faster amplification of the viral target using a simple constant-temperature heat bath, enabling rapid viral detection that can be deployed even in low-resource areas. In recent years, other digital isothermal methods, such as RPA-or LAMP-based digital PCR methods, have been developed for detecting a variety of DNA targets [49] [50] [51] [52] . However, these methods are limited by their low specificity, due to the inherent tolerance of RPA/LAMP-based methods for base-pair mismatches as compared to traditional PCR methods [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] . Our digital CRISPR method overcomes this by exploiting the specificity conferred by the Cas12a-crRNA-based targeting system. The collateral cleavage activity of Cas12a amplifies the signal and thus increases the sensitivity. Our digital CRISPR-based method combines the speed and sensitivity of isothermal amplification with the specificity of the CRISPR system.\nAnother advantage of our digital CRISPR method over other CRISPR-based methods [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] is its one-pot reaction design, which reduces manual manipulation All rights reserved.

In this streamlined one-pot reaction, both nucleic acid amplification and CRISPR-based detection are combined into a single step in a closed tube, significantly reducing the risk of cross-contamination between samples during batch processing. A major drawback of current CRISPR-based methods is the complexity of designing appropriate crRNAs that are limited to target regions in proximity to a PAM. This limitation may potentially complicate CRISPR-based virus detection since mutations in the viral PAM sequence may disable recognition by the Cas protein as the virus evolves. In contrast, our simpler digital CRISPR crRNA design is independent of the PAM sequence because it targets single-stranded DNA generated after amplification 34 .\nOur digital CRISPR method reported here uses commercially available chips and devices that can potentially be adapted to other devices already in use at some hospitals and service laboratories. These are QuantStudio 3D Digital PCR System (Thermo Fisher), QIAcuity Digital PCR System (QIAGEN), and Droplet Digital PCR System (Bio-Rad). We therefore envisage greater ease of adoption of our technology at these facilities. Furthermore, our digital CRISPR method offers a potentially customizable solution that is amenable to other DNA isothermal amplification platforms such as loop-mediated isothermal amplification, rolling circle amplification, and strand displacement amplification technologies, as well as the use of other Cas proteins, such as Cas13a, Cas12b, Cas14 for multiplex detection.\nWe have established and characterized a digital CRISPR method, which combines the speed and sensitivity of isothermal amplification, the specificity of CRISPR-based detection, and the ability to obtain absolute quantification by sample partitioning. Our digital CRISPR method detects a concentration of viral DNA as low as 0.897 copy/\u00b5L and enables rapid, absolute quantification with a dynamic range of 0.6 to 2027 copies/\u00b5L within one hour at a constant temperature, with no cross-reactivity to other similar viruses. Future work will focus on expanding the applications of our digital CRISPR method to areas such as gene expression analysis, rare mutant detection, copy number variation, and sequencing library quantification. Applications of such rapid analytics will also benefit cell therapy, pharmaceutical, environmental, public health, security and food industry to potentially determine the replication competency of adventitious agents."}, {"section_title": "Materials", "text": "Preparation of primers and DNA targets: Oligonucleotides (primers), ssDNA-FQ reporters, SARS-CoV-2 N gene-containing G-Block, SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS N gene-containing plasmids were synthesized by or purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies.
