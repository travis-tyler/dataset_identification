[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is strongly determined by genetic factors and recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several genes for the disease risk. In addition to the disease risk, age-at-onset (AAO) of AD has also strong genetic component with an estimated heritability of 42%. Identification of AAO genes may help to understand the biological mechanisms that regulate the onset of the disease. Here we report the first GWAS focused on identifying genes for the AAO of AD. We performed a genome-wide meta-analysis on three samples comprising a total of 2222 AD cases. A total of B2.5 million directly genotyped or imputed single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were analyzed in relation to AAO of AD. As expected, the most significant associations were observed in the apolipoprotein E (APOE) region on chromosome 19 where several SNPs surpassed the conservative genome-wide significant threshold (P < 5E-08). The most significant SNP outside the APOE region was located in the DCHS2 gene on chromosome 4q31.3 (rs1466662; P = 4.95E-07). There were 19 additional significant SNPs in this region at P < 1E-04 and the DCHS2 gene is expressed in the cerebral cortex and thus is a potential candidate for affecting AAO in AD. These findings need to be confirmed in additional well-powered samples."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), a devastating neurodegenerative disease, is the most common form of dementia among the elderly. Genetically, AD is a complex and multifactorial disease with the possible involvement of multiple genes. The rare early-onset form of the disease usually follows an autosomal-dominant inheritance pattern and to date three genes have been identified: amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin 1 and 2 (PSEN1 and PSEN2). The common late-onset form of the disease is much more complex than the early-onset form and until recently the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene was the only major genetic factor accounting for 20-29% of the risk for late-onset AD.\n1,2 Recent large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified nine additional genes for late-onset AD, including CR1, BIN1, CLU (a.k.a. APOJ), PICALM, MS4A4/ MS4A6E, CD2AP, CD33, EPHA1 and ABCA7. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] There is high heritability for AD risk (up to 80%), 8 but the total risk attributable to all confirmed loci is about 50%, indicating the presence of additional risk genes for late-onset AD.\nIn addition to the disease risk, age-at-onset (AAO) of AD is also genetically influenced 9, 10 with an estimated heritability of about 42%. 10 The APOE gene, in addition to affecting the risk of AD, also has a significant impact on AAO of AD and explains about 10% of its variation. 1 Several additional loci with effect sizes similar to or even greater than that of APOE have been suggested. 9 However, some additional genes implicated in AAO of AD have effect sizes far less than the effect of APOE. 11, 12 Recently a GWAS implicated a locus on chromosome 14 with AAO of AD, 13 but it was not confirmed in a replication study. 14 In this study we have used GWAS data from three independent samples in an effort to identify additional AAO loci in AD. The initial association analysis was performed in a new GWAS data derived from the University of Pittsburgh Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC), which was subsequently combined with two existing GWAS data from Mayo 15 and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 16 for meta-analysis."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": "University of Pittsburgh ADRC sample Genomic DNA from 1440 AD cases was genotyped using the Illumina HumanOmni1-Quad (San Diego, CA, USA) as part of the stage 1 discovery sample.

Genotypes for two APOE SNPs, rs429358 (E*4) and rs7412 (E*2) were determined either as previously described 19 or using TaqMan SNP genotyping assays. Exclusion criteria for individual samples included high genotype failure rate (106 individuals were removed because of a genotype failure rate > 2%), and cryptic relatedness (43 individuals were removed because they displayed an average degree of sharing (identity by state, or IBS) > 0.4 with other members of the data set). An additional 101 cases that passed the stringent quality control criteria were excluded because of the uncertainty in AAO. Exclusion criteria for markers included minor allele frequency (189 727 SNPs were removed because of MAF < 1%), deviation from Hardy-Weinberg expectations (2239 SNPs gave a HWE test P-value p1E-06), and high genotype failure rates (22 385 SNPs were removed because of genotype failure rates > 2%).

A Bonferroni-adjusted significance level of P < 5E-08 was employed to determine genome-wide significance following meta-analysis. Significance values from linear regression analyses were used for ranking purposes only, and so were not adjusted for multiple testing. After performing analyses for each SNP in each study sample individually, a meta-analysis was performed to obtain pooled estimates of the effect of these SNPs on AAO of AD across all study groups. Meta-analysis was done using a fixed-effects methodology, as implemented in PLINK. Heterogeneity testing was accomplished using Cochran's Q statistic, summarized as the I 2 statistic (the percentage of total variation across studies that is due to heterogeneity rather than chance). 21, 22 All analyses were done in R and/or PLINK using methods that correctly employ the imputed posterior probabilities for all genotypes at each SNP."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "Initially we performed association analysis of AAO in our new GWAS data on the University of Pittsburgh ADRC sample, where a total of 1440 AD cases were genotyped using the Illumina Human Omni-Quad1. After standard quality control filters for both genotypes and samples and imputing for unobserved genotypes, a total of B2.5 million SNPs were examined in 1190 AD cases for association analysis. Association of SNPs with AAO was tested using linear regression of the quantitative phenotype that included sex and the first four principal components as covariates. Figure 1a shows the quantile-quantile plot for comparison of observed and expected P-values distribution in the ADRC sample that demonstrates no evidence of significant population stratification but strong evidence of genetic associations. Figure 2 shows the genome-wide P-values in the ADRC sample in a Manhattan plot. As expected, the most significant associations were observed in the APOE region on chromosome 19 where five SNPs surpassed the genome-wide significant threshold of P < 5E-08 in the ADRC sample. The most significant SNP was rs429358 (E*4) in the APOE gene (P = 3.37E-18) followed by rs6857 in TOMM40 (P = 4.85E-15) rs4420638 in APOC1 (P = 4.14E-14), rs157582 in TOMM40 (P = 1.91E-13) and rs2075650 in TOMM40 (P = 2.17E-10). The regional association plot including all SNPs in the APOE region is given in Supplementary Figure 1 . After removing SNPs in the APOE region, a deviation of P-values from the null distribution remained in the quantile-quantile plot, although within the 95% confidence interval of the expectation ( Figure 1b) . As no other SNPs outside the APOE region were genome-wide significant, we performed a meta-analysis by combining the University of Pittsburgh ADRC GWAS data with the Mayo (n = 844) and ADNI (n = 188) GWAS data. Figure 3 shows the distribution of AAO in the three samples. Although the AAO distribution is almost normal in the ADRC and ADNI samples, it is skewed towards older AAO. The quantile-quantile plot with the meta-analysis results is shown in Supplementary Figure 2 . The meta-analysis of three samples yielded 11 non-APOE loci with P < 1E-05 (Table 1 ). All SNPs with P < 1E-04 in the meta-analysis are presented in the Supplementary Table. The association of all top 11 non-APOE significant SNPs was consistent in direction in the three samples as reflected in b-values. Furthermore, 10 of the top 11 non-APOE SNPs were directly genotyped or had proxy genotyped SNPs with P < 1E-04 on Illumina arrays (see Table 1 and Supplementary Table) , thus eliminating potential spurious associations due to imputation artifact. The most significant SNP outside the APOE region, rs1466662, was located in the DCHS2 gene on chromosome 4q31.3 at position 155.57 Mb (P = 4.95E-07). There were 19 additional significant SNPs in this region at P < 1E-04 a. Figure 4 shows the regional plot for SNPs within 500 kb on either side of the DCHS2 index SNP and the meta P-values for markers, which had P < IE-04 in the metaanalysis. Chromosome 4 harbors another potential region for AAO at position 32.88 Mb (P = 4.13E-06 for top SNP rs10517270) and this region had the most number of significant SNPs (n = 25) at P < 1E-04 (Supplementary Figure 3) . There is no known gene in this region. The regional plots for the remaining nine top loci associated with AAO are shown in Supplementary Figures 4-12 . In order to remove any variation in AAO owing to the established effect of APOE, we also analyzed the data after adjusting for the effect of APOE*4, but found no appreciable difference in P-values for the non-APOE loci ( Table 1 ), indicating that their effects are independent of APOE."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The focus of almost all reported GWAS related to AD has been on identifying genes for the disease risk. However, in addition to the disease risk, AAO of AD has also strong genetic component with an estimated heritability of 42%. 9, 10 Here we report the first GWAS focused on identifying genes for the AAO of AD. We performed a genome-wide meta-analysis on three GWAS data sets comprising a total of 2222 cases. Only the APOE/TOMM40/APOC1 region demonstrated genome-wide significant association with AAO, which is due to the previously well-established association of the APOE *4 SNP, as this demonstrated the most significant association in the discovery sample.\nThe present GWAS for AAO has identified 11 suggestive loci that although do not meet the strict criteria for genome-wide significant, their consistent and directional associations in three independent samples suggest that they are worthy of follow-up in additional studies. This is supported further by the fact that many of these suggestive loci contain genes that are expressed in the brain, and thus they may be relevant to AAO of AD. Our top SNP (rs1466662) is located in the DCHS2 gene on 4q13 that is expressed in cerebral cortex. 23 Interestingly, another potential region on chromosome 4 (the fifth top SNP on 4p15), although gene poor, is located in the same broad region recently implicated in differential response to antipsychotic drugs in schizophrenia patients. 24 The second top SNP (rs17429217) is located in the HRK (also known as DP5) gene on 12q24, which is a member of the pro-apoptotic-only Bcl2 family and is abundantly expressed in the brain, especially in hippocampus. 25 The third top SNP on 3p14 (rs704454) is near the ADAMTS9 gene, which is expressed in the spinal cord and brain along with other tissues, 26 and the later is a susceptibility gene for type 2 diabetes. 27 The fourth top SNP on 9p24 (rs2034764) is in the KCNV2 gene that is adjacent to the VLDL-receptor (VLDLR) gene, which is expressed in the brain and binds to APOE, 28 and genetic variation in VLDLR has previously been linked to dementia. 29 The fifth top SNP (rs2104362) resides in an intergenic region on 6p21 that contains a nearby micro RNA gene MIR1275 of unknown function. The last top SNP (rs17764668) is located in the NRXN3 (neurexin 3) gene on 14q13 at B80 Mb. NRXN3 is expressed in the brain and previous studies have identified this gene to be associated with addiction and obesity. 30, 31 Previously Bertram et al. 13 reported that a SNP (rs11159647) located at B84 Mb in this region of 14q13 was associated with AAO of AD. However, this SNP did not show significant association in any of our three samples (P = 0.335, 0.075 and 0.301 in the ADRC, Mayo and ADNI samples, respectively; P = 0.446 in stage 3 meta-analysis). Other members of the neurexin gene family have been associated with AD, including structural neuroimaging phenotypes in ADNI, 32 where NXPH1 (rs6463843) was related to decreased gray matter density on magnetic resonance imaging in individuals with the T/T relative to the G/G genotype. In particular, AD patients homozygous for the T allele showed differential vulnerability to right hippocampal atrophy as indicated by a SNP \u00c2 diagnosis interaction.\nThe potential significance of the other four regions in the present study, not discussed above, is not clear as the 16q24 SNP is not located in a known gene and the known neighboring genes on both sides of this SNP are B400 kb away. Although the other three regions on 18q21, 15q25 and 2q37 have known genes, their role in AD is not clear.\nIn conclusion, this study has confirmed the established association of the APOE locus with AAO of AD by revealing several genome-wide significant SNPs in this region. Although we did not identify any non-APOE SNPs meeting a conservative threshold of genome-wide significance, we have identified 11 suggestive loci, many of them harboring potential biological candidate genes that warrant follow-up in additional samples.
