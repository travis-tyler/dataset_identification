[{"section_title": "", "text": "What percentage of teachers spent their own money on classroom supplies during the 2014-15 school year? Public school teachers were asked how much of their own money, if any, they spent on classroom supplies without reimbursement during the 2014-15 school year. Overall, 94 percent of teachers spent any money on classroom supplies (figure 1). A higher percentage of teachers in traditional public schools (94 percent) spent their own money on classroom supplies than teachers in public charter schools (88 percent). A higher percentage of teachers of elementary grade levels (95 percent) spent their own money on classroom supplies than teachers of secondary grades (93 percent). A lower percentage of teachers at schools that did not participate in the free or reduced-price school lunch program (86 percent) spent their own money on classroom supplies than teachers at schools in which 0-34 percent, 35-49 percent, 50-74 percent, or 75 percent or more of students were eligible for free or reduced-price lunch (94, 94, 94, and 95 percent, respectively).

Among teachers who spent any of their own money on classroom supplies without reimbursement, the average (mean) amount spent was $479, and the median amount spent was $297. About 44 percent spent $250 or less, while 36 percent spent from $251 to $500 (figure 2). A higher percentage of charter school teachers spent $250 or less (48 percent) than teachers at traditional public schools (44 percent), and a lower percentage spent from $251 to $500 (32 percent at charter schools, compared to 36 percent at traditional public schools). There were no significant differences between the percentage of traditional public school and charter school teachers who spent $501 to $750, $751 to $1,000, or more than $1,000. The average amount spent was higher for teachers at city schools ($526) than teachers at suburban, town, or rural schools ($468, $445, and $442, respectively). The average amount spent by suburban teachers was higher than spending by town or rural teachers. A higher percentage of city teachers than suburban, town, or rural teachers spent more than $1,000 (9 percent, compared to 7, 6, and 6 percent, respectively), and a lower percentage spent $250 or less (41 percent, compared to 45, 45, and 46 percent, respectively). The average amount spent by teachers of elementary grades ($526) was higher than the amount spent by teachers of secondary grades ($430). A higher percentage of teachers of elementary grades spent more than $1,000 (9 percent compared to 6 percent), and a lower percentage spent $250 or less (38 percent compared to 50 percent). The average amount of $554 spent by teachers at schools with 75 percent or more eligibility for free and reducedprice lunch was higher than the average amount of $434 spent by teachers at schools with 0-34 percent eligibility. At schools at which 75 percent or more of students were eligible for free or reduced-price school lunch, a higher percentage of teachers spent more than $1,000 (9 percent) than teachers at schools with 0-34, 35-49, or 50-74 percent eligibility. At schools that did not participate in the free or reduced-price lunch program, a lower percentage of teachers spent more than $1,000 (4 percent) than teachers at schools with any eligibility rate.  This NCES Data Point presents information of education topics of current interest. It was authored by Maura Spiegelman of NCES. Estimates based on samples are subject to sampling variability, and apparent differences may not be statistically significant. All stated differences are statistically significant at the .05 level. In the design, conduct, and data processing of National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) surveys, efforts are made to minimize effects of non-sampling errors, such as item nonresponse, measurement error, data processing error, or other systematic error."}]
