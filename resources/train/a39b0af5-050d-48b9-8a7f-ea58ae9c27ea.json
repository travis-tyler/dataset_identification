[{"section_title": "", "text": "issues and considerations in addressing multimorbidity research from a longitudinal perspective and present findings from longitudinal models that examine differences in the rate of chronic disease accumulation and multimorbidity onset between non-Hispanic white (white), non-Hispanic black (black), and Hispanic study participants in the Health and Retirement Study starting in middle-age and followed for up to 16 years. Although some countries have well-established birth cohorts for research on aging, few US projects have followed the evolution of women's health from midlife through older age, leaving gaps in understanding their health and ignoring a window of time spanning age groups during which women may benefit from health promotion and prevention efforts. Cohort studies of midlife and older women's health have begun to address this gap, providing opportunities to advance our understanding of both reproductive and healthy aging, including multiple racial/ethnic groups and US regions. Studying existing cohorts of aging women provides investigators with opportunities to: track changes over time, identifying trajectories of health along with aging; clarify antecedent-consequent relationships; identify how historical events may be related to emergent patterns of health; incorporate common data elements that allow comparisons within and across cohorts over time; and introduce new measures/ indicators, such as genomic markers. This symposium will provide a foundation for future research using existing databases from studies providing longitudinal health-related measures of women as they age. Opportunities for conducting new analyses on midlife and older women's health will be described for four large cohort studies: two studies of women exclusively --the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation and the Women's Health Initiative -and two studies with large numbers of women participants -the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging and the Rancho Bernardo Study of Healthy Aging. Unique and common considerations for answering future questions about women's health from menopause to Medicare in these studies will be discussed. The Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN) is a multisite, multiracial/ethnic longitudinal study of women initially aged 42-52 (N=3302) designed to characterize the physiological and psychosocial changes that occur during the menopause transition and to assess their relations to subsequent health and age-related diseases. Each of seven clinical sites recruited non-Hispanic white women and women belonging to a predetermined racial/ethnic minority (African American, Hispanic, Chinese, or Japanese). Cohort eligibility was determined from a cross-sectional survey of 16,065 women in 1996-97 aged 40-55 who were aged 42-52, had an intact uterus and at least one ovary, and not using hormone therapy. Cohort participants have been assessed in-person approximately annually through follow-up visit 15 in 2017 using a standardized protocol of detailed questions about medical, reproductive and menstrual history; lifestyle and psychosocial factors; physical and psychological symptoms; and anthropometric measurements, reproductive hormones, bone and body composition, and cardiovascular health. Medicine and Public Health, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California, United States, 3. Department of Family Medicine and Public Health, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California, United States RBS is an ideal cohort to study healthy aging in women and to examine sex differences in aging. Initiated in 1972, RBS enrolled 82% of adult residents of Rancho Bernardo, a suburb of San Diego. Residents were white, and middle to upper-middle class. Participants have been followed via 12 research clinic visits at ~4 year intervals and 32 mailed surveys. RBS contains detailed assessment of cardiometabolic disease risk factors, bone health, biomarkers, physical ability, cognitive function, health and reproductive history, medications, behaviors (smoking, drinking, diet, exercise) and psychosocial measures. Of the 6726 participants, 54% are women and 65% were aged \u226550 at enrollment. Vital status is known for 91% of the cohort; overall mortality is 71%. Death certificates have been coded for cause of death for 91% of decedents. We will discuss contributors to healthy longevity in RBS women (average age of death 86.4 yrs; 29% lived to age \u226590). The Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA), an ongoing continuous enrollment cohort study of normative aging established in 1958 currently conducted by the NIA Intramural Research Program, began including women in 1978. To date, nearly 1200 women aged 17-94 at enrollment (median=53 Q1-Q3=40-70) have been followed for up to 21 visits spanning 40 years (median visits=6; Q1-Q3=3-9). Over 3 days, participants receive comprehensive examinations, interviews, imaging and functional and cognitive evaluations; repeat visits occur every 1-4 years depending on age. The BLSA offers opportunities to examine distributions of, change in and interrelationships among several rarely concurrently ascertained parameters (e.g., cardiovascular fitness, resting metabolic rate, glucose challenge response, five-factor personality, brain volumes, and diet) over the life course and across birth cohorts. The BLSA also maintains an extensive biorepository. This talk will summarize the extensive measurement catalogue and timeline and provide illustrative examples from ongoing research on women's aging and health.
