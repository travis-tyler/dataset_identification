[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The collection on women in agriculture includes profiles on farm women, anthropological studies and case studies, particularly from the Third World. Most of this literature is written by women. When Ester Boserup, an economist, published her book, Women in Economic Development m 1970, she was one of the first to focus on the relationship between women's role and economic development. Boserup documented the connections between certain land use patterns and agricultural techniques and its relationship to division of labor based upon gender. Experts on both colonial and contemporary agriculture have viewed crop production as being a male oriented task because that reflected the traditional European concepts. Consequently, women in underdeveloped countries were rarely involved in the development process. They were not permitted to participate in training programs for agricultural modernization and development and their contributions to agriculture have been ignored. Rural women were deprived of their right to land ownership as a result of land reforms instituted by male oriented European administrators. Boserup's study initiated a considerable amount of debate and research on the participation of women in world agriculture. The books cited in the bibliography reflect women's roles and contributions to agriculture in the industrialized countries and the developing countries. These books have been acquired for the Douglass collection to serve the disciplines of agriculture, rural sociology and women's studies. A growing role for women in agriculture is anticipated in the future as the struggle for women's rights grows and receives more serious consideration in the world arena."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "Books on women in agriculture in the Rutgers University Libraries are representative of the existing works on this topic.

The Labor of Women in the Production of Cotton. New York: Arno Press, 1975. This monograph deals with the life and work of women who lived on the cotton farms of Texas and who formed a considerable part of the group classified in the census of 1920 as \"farm population\". The female portion of this farm population consisted of 1,092,000 individuals, but this study considers only the females 14 years or older. Many statistical tables are provided on such topics as amount of field work done by Negro women, household work, periodical literature, books borrowed from libraries, average number of children under 15, marital status, etc. The questionnaires used in making this study are also reproduced, and we find some references for further reading and a detailed index in the back of the book. Douglass, Alexander HD6073.C662U52 1975 Atkeson, Mary Meek. The Woman on The Farm. New York: Century, 1924. In preparing for writing this book the author met and interviewed many hundreds of farm women at field days and organization meetings in many parts of the country. Nearly a thousand pieces of correspondence were received from every state of the Union, and the author had access to thousands letters from farm women, received in 1920 by Farm and Home and in 1922 This autobiography was first published in 1914 and tells the story of an English woman writer settling as a wheat farmer on the Canadian prairie in Saskatchewan. She came from England to visit her brother who had started farming, but did not succeed. She decided to remain on the prairie in spite of the poverty and diversity and became a prosperous farmer. The life of a woman farmer is quite different from the life of a farmer's wife on the prairie. She describes her experiences during the first three years and offers advice to other women who would like to make their living in agriculture. This book is about women in the agricultural community of Mayobamba, a settlement of 450 people, and Chiuchin, a trade center with 250 residents on the mountainside north of Lima, Peru. The first part of the book examines women's position in the communities and particularly women's subordination, marriage and family politics. The second part of the book discusses the sexual division of labor and how women participate in a broad range of agricultural activities, and the rigidly enforced cultural patterns governing access and sex role stereotypes. The book also describes women's position in the agrarian class system, women's consciousness and participation in the patriarchal power structure and the effect of social change and national development on the women in the two communities. There is a bibliography and an index in the back. The Sandinista revolution in Nicaragua initiated an agrarian reform law in 1981; this was the first time in Latin America that women were explicitly included as beneficiaries of reforms in the agricultural sector. The objective of this study is to analyze the process through which women became members of the cooperatives, to determine the extent which women's participation is a result of the agrarian reform law, what factors encouraged women to participate in the cooperatives, and what were the barriers they encountered.\nOne of the more important findings of this short study revealed that as long as women carry the full burden of child care and housekeeping, they cannot participate in agriculture on an equal basis with men. The study illustrates the difficulties of integrating women into the cooperatives. One year after the agrarian reform, only 6% of the cooperative members were women. However, the female members were able to enhance their technical, organizational and political development. Douglass HD6073. A292N5613 1985 Deere, Carmen Diana and Magdalena Leon de Leal. Women in Andean Agriculture: Peasant Production and Rural Wage Employment in Columbia and Peru. Geneva: International Labour Office, 1982. The census data of the Andean region suggest that the participation of rural women in agriculture has decreased in recent decades, but the authors of this monograph imply that it may in fact have increased.\nThe study draws on peasant household sample surveys for three areas of Columbia and Peru. The census data indicated that in peasant smallholder agriculture, women participate in both field work and decision-making. The book contains over 30 statistical tables. Alexander HD6073. A292N5613 1985 Fairbanks, Carol. Prairie Women: Images in American and Canadian Fiction. Yale University Press, 1986. This is a study which looks to the past at the lives of prairie women in the United States and Canada, \"seeing with new eyes, and entering old texts from a feminist critical perspective\". The author analyzes the way women writers have described the experiences of pioneer prairie women and how they described the \"new\" land-the land that was new to the pioneers but old and familiar to the native people. A collection of stories by farm women relating their experiences with various farming techniques, flower gardens, animals, religious life, politics, and destruction of crops by grasshoppers and drought.\nThe women do not boast about their ability to endure, they describe the experiences as they occurred. The more painful situations are often passed over quickly and \"dignity is the dominant tone struck by women who worked hard and developed self-confidence\", say the editors in the preface. The book has a short index. Douglass HQ1410. Fink is an anthropologist who returns to Boone County in her home state of Nebraska to gather data on what it was like to be a woman in rural Nebraska in the late 19th and early 20th century. She discovered that it was not easy to get the women to talk about the past, because it contained experiences that were heartbreaking and humiliating. The topics covered are land ethics, women's work, fertility, rural violence, agrarianism and current farm politics. In the final chapter the author offers a history of agrarianism and rural development in Boone County. This is an anthropological study of a rural community in Iowa in the years following World War II. The data was derived from in-depth interviews with 43 women and 5 men, and census statistics and historical records from churches and the county extension office.\nIn the chapter \"Eggs: A Case in Point\" the author discusses the changes that took place in women's control of the egg production. This had been women's work and it provided supplementary income to the farm families during the years 1925 to about 1974. However, technological changes in poultry and egg production forced the small-scale women producers out of business. The loss of income forced women to take low paying jobs in the nearby towns, thus changing the nature of farming in rural Iowa. The book includes a bibliography and index. This well documented account of farm women's work and lives is set in the Philadelphia area during the years 1750 to 1850. It tells of women who remained on the farms at a time of increasing industrialization. Using wills, inventories, poorhouse and church records, Jensen explains women's efforts to contribute to farming, to household work and to the community. The book focuses on the commercial sphere where women directly shared in economic development. In the chapter on \"Butter Trade\" the author portrays the women as shapers of the emerging commercialization of the farms. The butter making became a cottage industry that provided an important source of income to farm families during a period of economic transition.\nThe last part of the book includes studies of women's activities in religion, education and reform. In the Appendix are tables on household inventories from Chester and Castle Counties in Pennsylvania, and statistics on butter prices in Philadelphia from the years 1784 to 1849. There are also notes on the sources used and an index. The editor of this anthology explains in the introduction how difficult it was to find documents on women working on the land. Most rural women left no records of their lives because they were not literate. Native American women had no written language of their own, and African-Americans in the south were seldom permitted to learn to read and write. The Grange is a secret fraternal organization that first appeared in 1866, flourished during the 1873 depression, declined abruptly after 1875, and slowly revived in the 1880s. Most of the earlier members were mid-western, but the second Granger movement that began in the 1880s was predominantly eastern. The organization fostered cooperative enterprises, called for economic reforms, and tried to improve farmers' social and intellectual lives by bringing neighbors together for what were intended to be enjoyable and stimulating meetings. The Grange was always meant to serve farmers in particular, but it has never been an organization of farmers exclusively. The author observes women's participation in Grange activities, the role they played on the committees and the extent in which men and women could participate together in certain ceremonies. Each chapter has a long list of references. The focus of this book is on women who operate their own farms or are wives of farm operators. It also looks at how the nature of their farm and their families shape their work on and off the farm, with and without pay. The book is based on data from the federal Census of Agriculture. The author also participated as a researcher in the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Farm Women's Survey in 1980. In this survey, telephone interviews were conducted with 2,509 female farm operators and 569 male farm operators to determine the extent of the farm women's work, decision making, and off farm employment.\nThe data show that farm women's work changed according to the characteristics of the farm, the women's age and education, and the number of children in the family. In the Appendix are the questionnaires used for the survey, and an extended list of references. This book focuses on the work farm women are doing today, why they are doing it, and the obstacles they face while discovering and asserting their identities. The book includes information on common concerns such as rural day care, financial independence for farm women, business know-how, or the isolation of farm life. In all of these endeavors, the rural women have found a sense of self-worth and increasing self-confidence. Douglass HD6073. This is a collection of papers from a symposium held in 1979 at the University of Illinois, at Urbana-Champaign. The purpose of the symposium was to promote the field of economic studies on women in Africa, and to provide a forum for exchange of ideas among scholars and professionals concerned about women.\nThe book is divided into four sections and covers topics on women's production outside the development process; economic change and ideological conflicts; differential effects of development policies, and women and work in Africa. This is one of the most cited studies of works on women in agricultural development. Ester Boserup, an economist, was the first to note the prevalence in Africa of female farming systems where all the tasks connected to food production are done by women. Boserup documented the ties between certain land use patterns and agricultural techniques, and the division of labor based upon gender. She regarded the African agricultural system as the prototype female farming system. Boserup analyzed the modernization of agriculture and the migration to the cities, and its effect in changing the sexual patterns of productive work. She also linked these patterns to population density, landholding systems and technology. She expressed concern that this transition would deprive women of their productive roles in the developing African societies and urged further study of these trends. There are over 60 statistical tables,references, and an author index. Douglass, Alexander, Camden, Dana, Kilmer HD6223.B68 Bukh, Jette. The Village Woman in Ghana. Uppsala: Scandinavian Institute of African Studies, 1979.\nThe author presents an analysis of data collected in a village, Tsito, in South East Ghana in 1973 and in 1976-77. She analyzes the changes in the roles of both men and women in the public and domestic sphere of agricultural production. Bukh asserts that the development of the market economy and the introduction of cocoa cultivation brought a new social division of labor that allocated to women a major role within subsistence activities.\nThe men were drawn into the cash economy, first as cocoa producers and later on, when the condition for cocoa production changed, as migrant workers. The structural transformation of the society created more freedom for women, but the women are caught between their traditional responsibility for their children and lack of control over necessary economic resources, like land, labor and money. The number of divorces are increasing in the village, most often on the initiative of the women. This textbook is divided in three parts covering African women in the economy, in the society and culture, and in politics and policy. The book is clearly intended as a textbook and our copy has been heavily used by the students (underlined and marked in the margin). The Appendix contains selected statistics on African women, a bibliography, backgrounds of contributors, and an index. A series of studies on the tropical regions of Africa covering a range of ecological conditions, different approaches to agricultural development, and cultural patterns. Volume 1 is a synthesis of the project and volume 2 presents case studies. The purpose of the project was to evaluate the programs and identify factors which accounted for success or failure. The factors examined included receptivity and incentives to change, labor, land intensification and farm economics, use of machinery, land tenure and land use priorities, agricultural extension, training and education, and credit, marketing and cooperatives. Kilmer HD2117. This issue of Canadian Journal of African Studies brings together articles about women in east, central and west African countries, which examine political roles and tactics, marital and family patterns, economic activities, education and the difficulties in changing of women's roles.\nAfrican women have had very little participation in the development plans in their respective countries. Policy-making has generally consisted of coalitions of males from Western and African countries who made decisions regarding the roles of women. Three of the articles are in French.

They specifically make clear how women's roles and gender differences are ignored when development projects are implemented. Douglass HQ1726. W67 1984 Croll, Elizabeth. Women and Rural Development in China: Production and Reproduction. Geneva: International Labour Office, 1985 This study is part of the World Employment Programme, which comprises research, workshops and seminars, advisory services and field projects. The objective of the program is to find ways to improve the incomes and employment of working women in rural areas of China.\nThe study is presented into two parts. The first part outlines the main characteristics of the development policies and the reorganization of rural sectors in China from 1949 to 1978. It analyzes the effects these policies had on women's productive and reproductive activities and assesses the extent to which both traditional and new ideological economic and organizational constraints continued to inhibit the position of women working in the rural sectors.\nThe second part of the study looks at the more recent political and socioeconomic rural policies and programs implemented in rural areas of This is a comparative study of part-time family farming in the United States and Japan. The author conducted interviews with farm families in both countries to identify meaningful similarities and differences. The study also looks at part-time farming, which is becoming of greater importance as national economic development progresses. Kada examines the lives of farm families and the influences of farm operation, farm labor, life cycle of the families, aspirations and goals and off farm employment opportunities.\nEach chapter presents relevant statistics and the book includes questionnaires used in the interviews, a short bibliography and an index. This study examines the nature and evolution of the plantation system in Sri Lanka. The author analyzes the various activities undertaken by the female workers and the economic implications for the plantation sector and the country. The study includes a historical background of the Sri Lankan plantations; and a discussion of the sociological structure of plantation labor and its implications for women. This interesting book gives a history of rural women in the development of the Soviet Union. The old peasant family vanished, and in the rural family of 1987, women tended to be better educated than their husbands, and often took the lead in decision making. The process of modernization through which these changes have been brought about is one over which rural women themselves had little control. Development planning remained in the hands of the Communist Party, in which rural women were always poorly represented.\nThe book is divided in three parts with the first part discussing women in the rural work force, the effect of the rural population's migration to the cities, women as machine operators and dairy farmers, and women in management. The second part looks at women in the rural family, emergence of smaller families, division of labor, parental influence in marriage and inequality within the marriage. In the final part of the book, the author includes information on women's roles in rural culture, education of rural women, women's religious beliefs and female participation in political activities. Each chapter has appropriate statistical tables and there is a bibliography and an index. Douglass HQ1240.5.S65B75 1987 Farnsworth, Beatrice and Lynne Viola, Editors. Russian Peasant Women. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1992.\nThe essays in this volume encourage readers to look at Russian history in new and different ways, and to question the assumptions that the Revolution was a unique milestone in women's history. The first essays treat peasant women before the Revolution describing their lives and family roles. Later chapters cover events after the Revolution and their place in Soviet agriculture. The paper on women in Soviet agriculture shows the extent to which agriculture became dependent on female labor following migration of the young and the men from the rural to the urban sectors throughout the Soviet Union. Women remained in the countryside and took over the hard labor in agriculture; very few held managerial positions or were employed in skilled and mechanized work in the collective-farm system. The essay demonstrates that stateinitiated modernization did not alter the position of women in agriculture. This book is the first to present an accurate picture of the thousands of women who weeded the rice fields in Northern Italy during the early part of the 19th century. It includes a wide range of issues such as the history of the female labor force, their daily lives, and the efforts of the Socialist Party to lure women laborers away from the Catholic Church. The last chapter in the book covers the history of Italian feminism and the campaign for women suffrage. Labor actions of the women rice weeders were among the most radical of all workers in Italy prior to World War I. We find a lengthy bibliography and an index in the back.
