[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The ongoing coronavirus pandemic known as coronavirus disease 2019 , is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (1). The outbreak was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019, and was recognized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11 2020 (2) . According to Johns Hopkins dashboard, as of May 18, 2020, there are over 4.8 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 that have been reported in 188 countries and territories and claimed more than 318,000 lives. More than 1.5 million cases were confirmed in the U.S.\nCoronaviruses are a group of viruses that cause a significant percentage of all common colds in human adults and children. Four human coronavirus including 229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1 are prevalent and typically cause common cold symptoms in immunocompetent individuals (3) .\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the third coronavirus to cross species to infect human populations (probably transmitted from bats or another host), causing pandemics over the past two decades (4, 5, 6) . The previous two were the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) outbreak in 2002 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreak in 2012 (7, 8) . SARS-Cov-2 has a unique pathogenesis because it causes both upper and lower respiratory tract infections (9) . SARS-CoV-2 is classified as a novel betacoronavirus belonging to the sarbecovirus subgenus of Coronaviridae family. The genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is about 89% identical to bat SARS-like-CoVZXC21 and 82% identical to human SARS-CoV. It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 uses the same cell entry receptor, ACE2, to infect humans as SARS-CoV, so clinical similarity between the two viruses is expected, particularly in severe cases (10) .\nThe virus is typically spread by close physical contact and via respiratory droplets when people cough or sneeze (11, 12, 13) . People may also catch COVID-19 by touching their eyes, nose, or mouth immediately after touching a contaminated surface (12, 13) . It is most contagious when people are symptomatic, however, it may also spread when a person is asymptomatic (13). Nasal cells are identified as the key entry point for SARS-CoV-2 (14) . Goblet and ciliated cells in the nose have high levels of the entry proteins ACE-2 and TMPRSS2 that SARS-CoV-2 uses to get into human cells. The virus exploits existing secretory pathways in nasal goblet cells sustained at a pre-symptomatic stage. Nasal carriage is likely to be a key feature of transmission, therefore drugs administered intranasally could be highly effective in limiting spread. The two key entry proteins ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were also found in cells in the cornea of the eye, ocular as another route of infection (14, 15) . With SARS-CoV-2 detected in human tears, ocular secretions might be a potential for human to human spread (16) . There is controversy on whether the eye could be a transmission route for COVID-19, however, even if COVID 19 positive patients have no virus shedding through tears, the eye remains a potential portal of entry for ocular and systemic disease from the virus (16) . Therefore, developing nasal and ocular treatment to reduce and prevent transmission of the debilitating virus is a viable while potentially highly effective strategy.\nThere is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19, but development efforts are underway, including testing of existing medications (12) . Current primary treatment is limited to supportive treatment of symptoms. Recommended preventive measures include hand washing, covering the mouth when coughing, maintaining distance from other people, and monitoring and self-isolation for people suspected for being infected (12) . The COVID-19 case fatality rate has not yet peaked and it is anticipated that many more deaths will occur despite the efforts from many countries. There is, therefore, an urgent need to find effective ways to prevent and treat this virus.\nPovidone-iodine (PVP-I) is a complex of polyvinylpyrrolidone and iodine. It is also called iodophor and contains 9-12% iodine. It is a powerful disinfectant with broad-spectrum application and is effective against viruses, bacteria, fungi, and mold spores. PVP-I products have been used as disinfectant for the inactivation of various bacteria and viruses for years because of their strong bactericidal and antiviral activities. Povidone-iodine (PVP-I) is routinely used in ophthalmology and general surgery. PVP-I has been used in acute and chronic treatment of a variety of human indications. There have been numerous clinical studies demonstrating the safety of PVP-I in a variety of topical applications in ophthalmology, otology, rhinology and dermatology (18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24) . PVP-I in nasal usage was also well documented, including both single use (24, 25) and multiple applications. 3M Company introduced PVP-I based skin and nasal antiseptic (Povidone Iodine Solution 5% w/w [0.5% available iodine] USP). It has rapid, broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, which reduces nasal bacteria, including S. aureus, by 99.5% in just one hour and maintains this reduction for at least 12 hours (26, 27) . In the clinical setting, rhinologists and oral surgeons commonly use higher concentrations of PVP-I for various antimicrobial therapies as it offers an affordable, potent, well-tolerated and widely available antiseptic option with little to no cross-resistance. Gluck and colleagues reported a phase I study (n=35) assessing tolerability and local effect of a PVP-I spray (PVP-I 2.2 or 4.4%) in single and repeated (3 times a day for 3 days). No safety-relevant finding or serious adverse events were reported, no evidence for cyto-nor genotoxicity obtained (28) .\nIt was reported that PVP-I formulations are effective against both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses (29, 30, 31) . The virucidal activity is mainly due to the free iodine released from PVP-I (32) . In one study, PVP-I was effective in inhibiting SARS-CoV infectivity (33) (34, 36, 37) . PVP-I has also shown efficacy in preventing the infection and limiting the spread of Ebola virus disease (EBV) (38) . Additionally, it is reported that PVP-I is virucidal against non-enveloped viruses e.g. polyomavirus, adenovirus, and poliovirus type 1 (31) . Due to the similarities among enveloped viruses, PVP-I is expected to show virucidal efficacy against SARS-CoV-2. However, there is no published data on the use of iodine for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19. Currently no PVP-I product has been approved as a potential protection and prevention for the spread of this new debilitating virus. as an adjunct to currently recommended PPE (39).\nIt's well known that nasal solutions are cleared off rapidly from the nasal cavity, while the conventional liquid ocular formulation is eliminated from the precorneal area immediately upon instillation because of lacrimation and effective nasolacrimal drainage (40) . The short contact time of water-soluble povidone-iodine on nasal mucosa or in the eye is undesirable and would necessitate frequent and multiple administration to maintain the virucidal efficacy, thereby limiting practicality and increasing medical burden for the patient. In addition, frequent dosing can lead to irritation and potential toxicity. Therefore, developing a safe, non-toxic and longacting PVP-I nasal spray or ophthalmic eye drop is an urgent medical need to protect people from SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as to block the transmission through the nasal cavity or through the eye.\nIn the current study, we investigated the in-vitro virucidal efficacy of PVP-I in-situ gel forming formulations against SARS-CoV-2 virus along with their safety assessment in animal toxicology studies. The results suggest that both IVIEW-1201 and IVIEW-1503, reduced SARS-CoV-2 viral titers to near or below the level of detection after 2 minutes of exposure. Therefore, these preparations could potentially be used as a disinfectant for the virus in the nasal cavity or in the eye, respectively. By employing either the sustained release nasal spray or ophthalmic eye drop delivery technologies, we expect to reduce, treat, and eliminate SARS-CoV-2 in the nasal, sinus cavity, and in the eye. Additionally, the long-acting nasal spray can potentially be utilized as a prophylaxis for protecting against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Only rabbits with clinical normal eyes were used in this study. 12 female rabbits were equally divided into four groups with three (3) rabbits per group.\nGroup one is vehicle, Group 2 is test group using 0.6% (6 mg/mL) PVP-I gel forming solution.\nGroup 3 is a test group using 1.0% (10 mg/mL) PVP-I gel forming solution, and Group 4 is a test group using PVP-I 0.6% (6 mg/mL)/ dex 0.1% (1 mg/mL) suspension. Each eye was dosed 35 \u00b5L/eye/dose for twice a day. The fluorescein and rose Bengal scores were assessed by calculating a global score for each eye at each time point as well as score incidence."}, {"section_title": "Intranasal Administration Toxicity Study", "text": "We have conducted a 28-day toxicity study using Sprague Dawley CD\u00ae IGS rats to determine the potential subchronic toxicity of a PVP-I formulation (0.8% PVP-I/0.064% Budesonide gel forming nasal spray formulation).

Intranasal administration of the formulation at dose levels of 25, 50 and 75 \u00b5l and saline control at dose levels of 75 \u00b5l were evaluated. The saline control or the test substance was administered into the right nostril via a 200 \u00b5l pipette twice daily (approximately 12 hours apart). The animals were observed at least once daily for viability, signs of gross toxicity, and behavioral changes, and weekly for a battery of detailed observations. All main study animals were subjected to a necropsy of the upper respiratory tract and related sinuses at study termination (Day 29).\nThyroids and lungs were collected and weighed. This formulation has higher PVP-I concentration compared to IVIEW-1503 formulation (0.6%).\nSince the intranasal usage of high concentration of PVP-I had no safety issues in the subchronic toxicity study, IVIEW-1503 as a nasal spray formulation should also have minimal to no safety concern."}, {"section_title": "Virucidal Assay", "text": "The IVIEW-1201 (1.0% PVP-I) and IVIEW-1503 (0.6% PVP-I) formulations were tested for virucidal activity at the following concentrations: full strength (90% sample and 10% virus solution), 1/1.8, 1/3.2, and 1/10 diluted in simulated tears or simulated nasal fluid, respectively. Solution and virus were incubated at 37\u02daC for three contact times of 30 seconds, 2 minutes, and 10 minutes. Following the contact period, the solutions were neutralized by a 1/10 dilution in test media containing 10% FBS and 0.5% sodium thiosulfate."}, {"section_title": "Virus Quantification", "text": "Neutralized samples were serially diluted using eight half-log dilutions in the test medium. Each dilution was added to 4 wells of a 96-well plate with 80-100% confluent VERO 76 cells. The toxicity controls were added to an additional 4 wells and 2 of these wells were infected with virus to serve as neutralization controls, ensuring that the neutralized samples did not continue to inhibit growth and detection of surviving virus. All plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO 2 .\nOn day 6, the post-infection plates were scored for presence or absence of viral cytopathic effect (CPE). The Reed-Muench method was used to determine end-point titers (50% cell culture infectious dose, CCID50) of the samples, and the log reduction value (LRV) of the compound compared to the negative (water) control was calculated."}, {"section_title": "Controls", "text": "The reduction of virus in formulation-treated test wells compared to virus controls was calculated as the log reduction value (LRV).

This was done by adding toxicity samples to titer test plates then spiking each well with a low amount of virus (~60 CCID50) that would produce an observable amount of CPE during the incubation period."}, {"section_title": "Ocular Toxicity Study Results", "text": "No meaningful signs of ocular irritation or corneal staining were observed in the vehicle group "}, {"section_title": "Intranasal Administration Toxicity Study Results", "text": "There were no mortalities during the course of the study and no test substance-related changes in body weight, body weight gain, food consumption, thyroid weights and lung weights for the duration of the study. There were no macroscopic observations at terminal sacrifice considered attributable to the administration of the formulation intranasally. Following a gross necropsy of the upper respiratory tract and related sinuses, there were no signs of irritation and no abnormalities were detected. Therefore, it has demonstrated the subchronic intranasal use of PVP-I is expected to have no toxicity concerns."}, {"section_title": "Virucidal Assay Results", "text": "Virus LRV (log reduction value) for IVIEW-1201 and IVIEW-1503 against SARS-CoV-2 virus are shown in Table 1 . PVP-I formulation toxicity was not observed at any concentration. Ethanol (45%) had some observable toxicity at the 30-second and 2-minute time points. As a result of this toxicity, the presence of virus could not be ruled out in those wells therefore the limit of detection was 1.7 log 10 CCID 50 of virus per 0.1 mL. patients (44, 45, 46, 47, 48) . One of the major limitations of the drugs mentioned above is that there is no data available on the adverse reactions of the high dosages of the antiviral drugs when\ngiven for long durations. The duration of medication needed is also currently unknown (48) .\nStudies have shown that the SARS-CoV-2 virus uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)\nin the lungs as a receptor and relies on an enzyme known as transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) to enter and fuse with host cells in order to replicate (49) . This has led medical professionals to test existing antivirals that are known to interfere with viral membrane fusion and disrupt RNA polymerase in order to prevent further viral production in hosts.\nHydroxychloroquine, an antimalarial and derivative of chloroquine, is one such therapy that is believed to be one of the potential therapies in treating COVID-19. Its mechanism has been used to prevent the transport of virions to the replication site by altering pH and block viral endocytosis to hosts (49) . However, in a recent COVID-19 trial consisting of 36 patients, 14 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine have continued to show symptoms of upper or lower respiratory tract infections (50) . Although hydroxychloroquine has increased potency and tolerable safety profile compared to chloroquine, potential adverse effects such as electrolyte imbalance and fatal dysrhythmias could take place (50) . Another possible therapy, Remdesivir \u00ae , a nucleotide analogue, inhibits viral RNA polymerase and was developed as a substance to combat ebolaviruses, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV (49, 52, 53) . With significant results in in vitro testing against SARS-CoV-2, the therapy appears to be another potential prophylaxis. PVP-I is a low-cost topical medication which could significantly reduce the burden on the existing health care system if it is proven to be effective in reducing viral load. Presently, the estimated cost of managing a patient with proven positivity for COVID 19 but without any complications is $9,673. For a patient with complications or co-morbidity it is $13,767 and for a patient with major complications or co-morbidity it increases to $20,292 (54) . If we only assess the deceased patients (281,399 by May 10, 2020) and presume that they were hospitalized without complications prior to their death, the amount globally spent to treat this condition would be over 2.72 billion USD. This still does not include testing costs or healthcare costs for those patients with mild to moderate complications.\nThe next phase is to determine if topical PVP-I nasal sprays and irrigations will result in a reduction in the SARS-CoV-2 viral load, and to show whether there is a significant reduction in hospitalization or need for advanced life support in these patients.
