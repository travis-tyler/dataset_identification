[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Background: The strong observational association between total homocysteine (tHcy) concentrations and risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) and the null associations in the homocysteinelowering trials have prompted the need to identify genetic variants associated with homocysteine concentrations and risk of CAD. Objective: We tested whether common genetic polymorphisms associated with variation in tHcy are also associated with CAD. Design: We conducted a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on tHcy concentrations in 44,147 individuals of European descent. Polymorphisms associated with tHcy (P , 10 28 ) were tested for association with CAD in 31,400 cases and 92,927 controls. Results: Common variants at 13 loci, explaining 5.9% of the variation in tHcy, were associated with tHcy concentrations, including 6 novel loci in or near MMACHC (2.1 3 10 29 ), SLC17A3 (1.0 3 10 28 ), GTPB10 (1.7 3 10 28 ), CUBN (7.5 3 10 210 ), HNF1A (1.2 3 10 212 ), and FUT2 (6.6 3 10 29 ), and variants previously reported at or near the MTHFR, MTR, CPS1, MUT, NOX4, DPEP1, and CBS genes. Individuals within the highest 10% of the genotype risk score (GRS) had 3-mmol/L higher mean tHcy concentrations than did those within the lowest 10% of the GRS (P = 1 3 10 236 ). The GRS was not associated with risk of CAD (OR: 1.01; 95% CI: 0.98, 1.04; P = 0.49).\nWe identified several novel loci that influence plasma tHcy concentrations. Overall, common genetic variants that influence plasma tHcy concentrations are not associated with risk of CAD in white populations, which further refutes the causal relevance of moderately elevated tHcy concentrations and tHcy-related pathways for CAD.\nAm J Clin Nutr 2013;98:668-76.\nSupplemental Material can be found at: Sciences, University of Leicester, Leicester (CPN and NJS) and NIHR"}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Observational studies have consistently shown that elevated concentrations of total homocysteine (tHcy) 6 are associated with an increased risk of coronary artery disease (CAD), stroke, and venous thrombosis in addition to other clinical conditions (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) . However, it is uncertain whether these associations are causal, given the absence of protection against cardiovascular events in homocysteine-lowering trials (7) . We therefore used a Mendelian randomization strategy to test whether long-term elevated concentrations of homocysteine are associated with an increased risk of CAD. Mendelian randomization is a method of using measured variation in genes of known function to examine the causal effect of a modifiable exposure on disease in nonexperimental studies. By examining whether common polymorphisms associated with variations in tHcy are also associated with CAD, we could explore the association between tHcy and CAD.\nTo date, 5 separate genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of blood tHcy concentrations have been published, including 4 in whites and 1 in Filipinos, which have collectively identified 7 independent loci definitively associated with tHcy concentrations (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) . These include the MTHFR C667T variant (rs1801133), the most widely studied consistently associated polymorphism with tHcy, and variants at or near the CBS, MTR, DPEP1, NOX4, CPS1, and MUT genes. Of these genes, the effect of the MTHFR functional variant on CAD was studied previously. In a meta-analysis of published results based on 26,000 CAD cases and .31,000 controls, Lewis et al (13) reported a significant association between the C667T variant with CAD in Asian populations only; the association between this variant and CAD in whites was close to null and not statistically significant. In contrast, the MTHFR Studies Collaboration showed no association of MTHFR C677T with risk of CAD in unpublished studies, irrespective of folate status or ethnic group. The latter metaanalysis compared the associations of MTHFR C677T with CAD in a meta-analysis of 19 unpublished data sets involving 48,175 CAD cases with a meta-analysis of 86 published studies involving 28,617 CAD cases and showed that the discrepant results of the unpublished and published studies were explained by publication bias and other methodologic problems in the published studies of Asian populations (14) .\nTo identify other common variants associated with risk of CAD through effects on tHcy concentrations, we extended previous efforts by performing a meta-analysis of 2.7 million genotyped and imputed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 10 GWAS, with data on a total of 44,147 individuals of European ancestry (including new data on 26,669 individuals) with measured blood tHcy concentrations, and tested whether common polymorphisms associated with variations in tHcy were also associated with CAD. We tested each individual tHcy-associated polymorphism and a weighted genotype risk score (GRS), composed of the top (highest P value) independent SNPs (as assessed by r 2 , 0.2 between associated SNPs) consistently associated with tHcy concentrations, for their association with CAD in 31,400 cases of CAD and 92,927 controls."}, {"section_title": "SUBJECTS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Homocysteine meta-analysis study populations", "text": "The current meta-analysis included data from a total of 44,147 white individuals of European ancestry derived from 10 GWAS on tHcy concentrations (see supplementary materials under \"Supplemental data\" in the online issue for details of each cohort).

To this end, we carried out a meta-analysis of 10 independent genome-wide association studies comprising a total of 44,147 individuals and identified 6 novel loci in or near genes MMACHC, SLC17A3, GTPB10, CUBN, HNF1A, and FUT2 and replicating variants previously reported at or near the MTHFR, MTR, CPS1, MUT, NOX4, DPEP1, and CBS loci. Furthermore, we provide statistical evidence pointing to the fact that there are $2 significant, independent loci in MTHFR, CUBN, NOX4, DPEP1, CBS, and SLC17A3. We then tested for an association between each lead SNP at these loci and a GRS combining these variants with an increased risk of hyperhomocysteinemia and CAD. Our results showed that genetic variants at the HNF1A locus-which are associated with reduced concentrations of tHcy-and previously associated with Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young increased the risk of type 2 diabetes, and plasma concentrations of C-reactive protein, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein are also significantly associated with a reduced risk of CAD. It is therefore plausible that this association is not caused by Hcy concentrations but rather to the pleiotropic role of this DNA variant, possibly through lipid metabolism. Although the aggregate GRS was significantly associated with hyperhomocysteinemia (OR: 1.40), we failed to detect an association between the GRS and CAD.\nWe used tHcy genetic variants to examine whether Hcy concentrations are causally related to CAD. Previous meta-analyses of published studies of MTHFR C667T and CAD had reported associations between the MTHFR variant and CAD (13, 43, 44) . However, the MTHFR Studies Collaboration reported no association of MTHFR C677T with CAD in unpublished studies and showed that the discrepant results of unpublished and published studies were a result of publication bias or other methodologic problems in the Asian studies. The current meta-analysis extends the findings for MTHFR C677T and CAD in European populations by studying the association of CAD with all available genetic variants that influence Hcy concentrations. With the possible exception of the HNF1A locus, our results did not provide any support for an association of the tHcy-associated variants with CAD, including the most widely studied MTHFR C677T variant. A formal assessment of the expected causal association under the assumptions of Mendelian randomization, with the GRS used as the instrumental variable, is consistent with the conclusion that tHcy does not cause CAD. Notably, our study 1) did not have the potential publication bias that a meta-analysis on published studies might have had, and 2) had sufficient power to pick up the previously reported effect size for MTHFR (30% increased risk) and the other SNPs. Power calculations showed that, for CAD, we had w90% power to detect an OR as low as 1.07 for SNPs with an allele frequency of $20%r (with an a = 0.004). Because the GRS was associated with a 3-mmol/L average elevation of tHcy, an 11% increased risk might plausibly have been anticipated from the observational studies if the association of Hcy with coronary artery disease seen in those studies was causal. With 12,138 such events among 45,705 individuals, this collaboration had .85% power to detect that difference. Therefore, these data indicate that a genetically raised concentration of Hcy itself is unlikely to be even a modest causal factor in CAD. Because the association of the MTHFR variant with tHcy concentrations varies by folate status, the effect of other variants for tHcy-related pathways on tHcy concentrations may also vary by folate status because of differences in national policies on folate fortification (14, 44, 46) . Despite differences in the effect of MTHFR C677T on tHcy concentrations by folate status, a previous meta-analysis has shown that such differences do not explain the null associations of MTHFRC677T with risk of CAD (14) , and there is no evidence that differences in folate status would influence the effects of other tHcy-related variants on risk of CAD.\nIt is important to highlight that our study had little power to detect associations with common variants of smaller effects or to rarer (2-5%) and/or rare (#1%) variants. Collectively, the identified polymorphisms explained only a small proportion of the total variance in tHcy concentrations, and the effect sizes attributable to the associated variants were modest, ranging from SD differences of 0.09 to 0.19 in tHcy per allele. This suggests that either a significant proportion of the genetic variants are yet to be discovered or that the true heritability of tHcy is substantially lower than the often quoted 63%.\nA second potential limitation pertained to the study design. We included data from 10 different GWAS studies on tHcy concentrations in our meta-analysis. Five of the 10 cohorts included participants from the United States, and 1 of these-BLSArecruited subjects after mandatory food fortification. For the other 5 cohorts, participants were predominantly from northwestern European ancestry. Note that tHcy concentrations were qualitatively very similar across the US cohorts, although folate concentrations were notably different, ranging from 7.9 to 23.6 pg/mL across the 4 cohorts (FHS, CHS, BLSA, and NHS), which had folate concentrations available (see Supplementary Table 2 under \"Supplemental data\" in the online issue). Total Hcy concentrations seem to vary significantly across the European cohorts. These differences might be explained in part by differences in age, sex distribution, medical and lifestyle factors, and technical differences in the measurement techniques. However, because we used normalized tHcy values for each population separately, and did not compare crude mean concentrations, these differences should not have affected the overall outcome of the meta-analysis.\nThe other important limitations pertain to the sex and ethnic distribution of the cohorts studied. More than 82% of the individuals from the 10 cohorts were female, and participants from 9 of the cohorts had a predominantly white ancestry, which meant that we had insufficient power to assess differences in gene associations by sex and our conclusions are restricted to populations of northwestern European ancestry.\nFinally, results from the conditional analyses based on different assumptions about the penetrance model of the lead (eg, MTHFR) loci may be warranted in future studies. Similarly, a thorough evaluation of the potential effect of other confounding factors (eg, lack of adjustment for B vitamin status), which can only be speculated about currently, needs to be tested in future studies.\nInterestingly, 3 of our novel associations in genes MMACHC, CUBN, FUT2, and in the confirmed association with MUT, have either been previously associated with variation in constitutive vitamin B-12 concentrations-MUT, FUT2, and CUBN-or in the case of MMACHC, are excellent candidates through association with Mendelian inborn errors of vitamin B-12 transport. Data from TwinsUK show that tHcy and vitamin B-12 concentrations are correlated (r = 20.09, P , 10 28 ). Thus, the simplest explanations for this could be that, because vitamin B-12 is an important cofactor in Hcy metabolism, any genetic perturbation of vitamin B-12 concentrations could have a pleiotropic effect downstream on circulatory concentrations of Hcy.\nFinally, previous studies have shown that tHcy concentrations increase with decreasing glomerular filtration rate, although the precise mechanism by which tHcy concentrations is related to glomerular filtration rate and consequently to CAD has not been established (46, 47) . Our results support the idea that it is not tHcy itself, but something that tHcy is a marker for, that is a causal risk factor for CAD. One possible candidate is renal impairment or perhaps more likely, a particular molecule that, such as tHcy, is increased in the setting of renal impairment. Two of our associations with tHcy, namely with variants in or in the vicinity of DPEP1 and SLC17A3, were previously shown to be associated with renal function. The gene DPEP1, which encodes for an enzyme that is highly expressed and active in the proximal convoluted tubules, is implicated in the renal metabolism of glutathione and its conjugates. Because DPEP1 deficiency leads to increased urinary excretion of cysteine-a precursor of tHcy-it has been hypothesized that genetic variation at DPEP1 affects renal activity by altering the renal handling of amino acids. We used data from the Rotterdam Study cohorts and adjusted our analyses for creatinine concentrations to test whether our association was driven by individuals with altered renal function, but this did not affect the results of the GWAS (data not shown). However, because creatinine concentrations serve as only a rough proxy for kidney function, we cannot completely rule out that this association is driven by kidney function.\nThe results of the current study extend the findings of previous studies of MTHFR C677T and CAD (14) by assessing the relevance for CAD of all available genetic determinants of tHcy concentrations, alone and in combination, and provide further refutation of the causal relevance of moderately elevated tHcy concentrations to CAD in white populations.\nStudy-specific acknowledgments are provided as part of the Supplementary Material.\nThe authors' responsibilities were as follows-JBJvM and KRA: conceived and designed the study; JBJvM, GP, SMS, AH, KRA: researched the data, contributed to the discussion, wrote the manuscript, and reviewed and edited the manuscript; JBJvM, TT, SHV, IC, XY, AM, CN, LMR, KRA: contributed to the analysis; SB, JCB, HB, MJB, CC, LF, A Hamsten, A Hofman, DJH, AG, ADJ, SK, EK, DPK, AALMK, JCC, PK, JL, BM, CN,"}]
