In AD, the onset of cognitive impairment is preceded by a long preclinical phase, lasting approximately 15 to 20 years [1] .\nThere is a large variability in the age at onset of AD, and only a small fraction of cases (1%) present clinical symptoms at an early age at onset (EO: before age 65). AD has a substantial but heterogeneous genetic component. Mutations in the Amyloid--beta Precursor Protein (APP) and\nPresenilin genes [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] cause the Mendelian forms of AD. Although autosomal dominant AD typically is associated with early symptoms onset (eADAD), some families that carry known pathogenic mutations present a late onset (onset>65--70) [7] , suggesting a continuum between late and early onset. Additionally, a large proportion of AD cases with strong familial history of dementia also present a late--onset, and a complex genetic architecture (familial LOAD; fLOAD).\nMost of the sporadic AD cases present a late onset (sLOAD), but occasionally can present an early onset (sEOAD). The APOE \u03b54 allele increases risk for sporadic early-- and late-onset AD [6] and also for familial late onset AD [7, 8] (3 fold effect size for heterozygous carriers and 12 fold for homozygous carriers [9] ). More recent genome--wide association studies of sporadic late onset AD have identified additional loci with moderate protective and risk effects [10--15] . Further studies suggest that Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS) created based on the 21 genome--wide loci capture the overall genetic architecture of late--onset AD and may help to predict AD risk [8, 16, 17] .\nPRS aggregates the effects that multiple genetic markers (both protective and risk variants) confer to individuals for a specific complex trait [18] . When employed as biomarkers, PRS can provide important insights about the prognosis of the disease, and can highlight early intervention strategies as well as inclusion criteria for targeted enrollment in clinical trials.\nFurthermore, PRS can be employed as a measure to identify the extent of overlap between the genetic architecture of co--morbid complex traits [19] . This is done, by evaluating the pleiotropic effects that the markers identified in one trait have in another trait, usually evaluated in an independent cohort. For example, this approach has been employed to study the shared genetic architecture between schizophrenia and cognitive function, as well as between depressive disorder and body mass index [19] .\nIt is unknown whether the GWAS loci identified for sporadic LOAD have any effect on additional cases (sEOAD, fLOAD or eADAD), or the relative genetic burden of those variants in the other classifications of the disease. Therefore, a thorough evaluation of these variants will help us understand the extent of the genetic architecture shared among the different classifications of AD. This will also be informative for current preventative drug trials, some of which are focused on Mendelian forms or individuals with high genetic risk under the assumption that there are global pathways which are similar in early and late onset AD.\nWe tested the hypothesis that features of the genetic architecture identified for sLOAD are shared by participants with other clinical manifestations of AD. To do so, we derived the PRS from common variants identified in GWAS of sLOAD [15] in additional cohorts of affected participants with European ancestry with early onset AD (both sEOAD and eADAD) as well as fLOAD. Then we tested the association of the PRS with the clinical status in each of these cohorts. Finally, we explored whether the PRS is modulating additional aspects of AD, and evaluated its association with the age at onset."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Samples", "text": "We included participants with European ancestry from the Knight--Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (Knight--ADRC) and the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN) study at Washington University [20] , the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) [21] , and the National Institute on Aging Genetics Initiative for Late--Onset Alzheimer's Disease (NIA--LOAD) [22] .\nCohorts: eADAD are defined as affected participants that carry known highly penetrant mutations in the Presenilin or APP genes. All the samples were selected from the DIAN study. fLOAD: Includes affected subjects from families with recorded familial history. Only one proband per family were included in the study. Probands were required to have a diagnosis of definite or probable late--onset AD (onset >65 years) and a sibling with definite, probable or possible late--onset AD with a similar age at onset. A third biologically--related family member (first, second or third degree) was also required, regardless of cognitive status. All the samples were selected from the NIA--LOAD study. sEOAD were defined as participants with diagnosis of AD, with an age at onset <65 without documented familial--history of AD. Samples were selected from the Knight--ADRC and ADNI. sLOAD: were defined as participants with clinical diagnosis of AD, age at onset >65, that do not specify documented family history of AD.\nSamples were selected from the Knight--ADRC and ADNI. Controls were defined as individuals older than 65 that after neurological assessment were determined to be non--affected.\nUnrelated samples were selected from the Knight--ADRC and ADNI. We included 236 sEOAD, 1021 sLOAD and 687 controls from the Knight--ADRC; 122 sEOAD, 226 sLOAD and 324 cognitively normal controls from ADNI; 1220 unrelated fLOAD from the NIA--LOAD and 249 eADAD (mutation carriers from the DIAN study).\nDescription of the AD datasets: Knight--ADRC research participants were evaluated by Clinical Core personnel at Washington University. Cases received a clinical diagnosis of AD in accordance with standard criteria and the presence or absence AD symptoms, and when present, their severity, was determined using the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) [23] .\nNeuropsychological and clinical assessments and biological samples were collected for all participants as described previously [24--29] . ADNI individuals were evaluated as described in Disorders Association (NINCDS--ADRDA) for probable AD [30] . All individuals had a family history of Alzheimer's disease. Probands were required to have a diagnosis of definite or probable late-onset AD (onset >60 years) and a sibling with definite, probable or possible late--onset AD with a similar age at onset. A third biologically--related family member (first, second or third degree) was also required, regardless of cognitive status. If unaffected, this individual had to be \u226560 years of age, but \u226550 years of age if diagnosed with LOAD or mild cognitive impairment. Within each pedigree, we selected a single individual to screen by identifying the youngest affected family member with the most definitive diagnosis (i.e. individuals with autopsy confirmation were chosen over those with clinical diagnosis only). Finally, eADAD participants (n=249) were drawn from the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN) [1, 31] . Individuals at risk for carrying a mutation for autosomal dominant AD (i.e. PSEN1, PSEN2 or APP) mutations] were enrolled in DIAN study. Participants from families with known pathogenic eADAD mutations were recruited from 197 families at six sites in the USA, one in the UK and three in Australia [1, 31] . The process of recruitment and enrolment has been described in detail previously [1, 31] . Table 1 summarizes the demographic and clinical characteristics of each clinical group.

All samples were imputed using SHAPEIT/IMPUTE2 [33, 34] with the 1000 Genomes Project as reference panel [35] . We discarded genotypes that did not pass quality criteria, and retained those with dosage levels >0.9 across all three genotype possibilities, and an information score filter >0.3.\nIn addition, we performed gender verification, tested for duplicates and unexpected familial relatedness, which were removed from our analysis, by estimating the pairwise genome--wide estimates of the proportion identity--by--descent. We performed standard quality control procedures on each genotyping array separately before combining data. A call rate \u2265 98% was applied for SNPs and individuals. SNPs not in Hardy--Weinberg equilibrium (p<1\u00d710 --6 ) or with MAF < 0.02 were excluded. We inferred the population structure and confirmed the ethnicity of participants by calculating the principal components using PLINK v1.9\n(http://www.cog--genomics.org/plink2). Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype was determined for all individuals [28] . Briefly, APOE \u03b52, \u03b53, and \u03b54 isoforms were determined by genotyping rs7412 and rs429358 using Taqman genotyping technology as previously described [28, 36] .\nWe employed proxy SNPs to tag the genome--wide significant loci reported for sLOAD [15] that did not pass our quality control process.

We observed that the PRS is significantly associated with clinical status for the sLOAD cases (model 1: OR=1.40; p=1.21\u00d710 --3 ; Table 2 ). As APOE alleles have a strong effect on the sLOAD, we extended the PRS to reflect the risk and protection effects of the \u03b54 and \u03b52 genotypes. The addition of the APOE genotype increased the effect of the PRS (model 2: OR=4.01; p=5.29\u00d710 --34 ). The ROC analysis revealed an Area Under the Curve (AUC= 0.67; 95% CI= 0.65--0.69) (Figure 1) , which resembles the results of other studies [8, 17] .\nThe PRS that summarizes the genetic effect of loci identified for sLOAD, is also significantly associated with risk in the familial late--onset AD (fLOAD) cohort (model 1: OR=1.75;\np=1.12\u00d710 --7 ; Table  2 ). Indeed, the effect that it has on risk for fLOAD is similar to that seen for sLOAD and is not statistically different (p=0.13).

None of these participants carry a pathogenic mutation in the known AD or FTD genes [7, 41] . We derived the PRS and included elderly non--demented participants as controls. Thus the statistical model corrects for sex, but not age. We observed an increased odds ratio associated with the PRS (model 1: OR=2.27; p=1.29\u00d710 --7 ; Table 2 ) which was significantly higher than the odds ratio estimated for the sLOAD cohort (p=9.78\u00d710 --3 ).

In particular, we hypothesized that the additive effects of the genome--wide significant loci identified for sLOAD would affect the AAO of AD for the entire spectrum of sporadic participants, regardless of the classification of the onset of symptoms (i.e. early vs late).\nWe initially verified that in our cohort of sLOAD, the PRS is associated with AAO, and as expected a lower AAO is associated with higher PRS for the sLOAD (\u03b2=--1.20; p=7.61\u00d710 --3; correcting for cohort and sex and \u03b2=--1.66 p=7.30\u00d710 --3 when we included APOE effect into the model). In contrast, the analysis within the sEOAD cohort did not show a significant association (p=0.37; and p=0.33 with and without APOE effects in the model, respectively).\nWe also investigated the effect of PRS on AAO in all sporadic AD cases (including all early--and late--onset cases) in specific quantiles of the AAO. We employed quantile regression analysis to model the association of the PRS to 5--quantiles (quintiles) of AAO [42] . This analysis showed that for all of the quintiles the PRS is significantly associated with AAO (p--values are < 0.05; Supplementary Table 1 panel A) . Our analyses revealed that all of the coefficient estimates fall within the confidence intervals of the ordinary least squares (OLS) method employed to solve linear regressions ( Supplementary Figure 1) ; indicating: 1) that a linear regression analysis should be sufficient to analyze the association between the PRS and the entire range of AAO (\u03b2=--2.10; p=1.06\u00d710 --4 ); and 2) that this association is not driven exclusively by the cases with older AAO, but all the cases (both early--and late--onset).

We calculated the PRS for these subjects along with elderly non--demented participants, which we employed as controls. In a similar approach to the one we employed for the sEOAD, age was not included in the model, as by design of the test, it predicts perfectly the case--control status. Our analysis did not show any significant association of the PRS with the clinical status for this cohort (model 1: Table  2 ). Neither did we observe a significant association of the PRS when we incorporated the risk conferred by the APOE \u03b54 and \u03b52 alleles into the PRS (model 2: Table  2 ). Nevertheless, we observed that the PRS is associated with the CSF phosphorylated Tau 181 --A\u03b2 42 ratio (\u03b2=0.18; p=4.36\u00d710 --2 ). The CSF ptau 181 --A\u03b2 42 ratio was previously shown to be a strong predictor of both the progression of cognitively normal subjects to very mild or mild dementia [43] and the rate of decline across time in individuals with very mild dementia [38] . These results suggest that if any, the effect size of the genetic architecture of sLOAD is too small to be significantly identified with statistical power conferred by the cohort of eADAD; but still it also indicates that these genetic risk factors are modulating biological aspects of AD, as it is shown by the association of the PRS and the ptau 181 --A\u03b2 42 ratio."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "To test for common genetic architecture among autosomal dominant and sporadic forms of early--and late--onset AD, we analyzed four cohorts of well characterized participants; and a common set of elderly non--demented participants. We derived PRS for the participants, assuming an additive non--interaction effect of the common (minor allele frequency (MAF) > 5%) genome--wide significant variants identified for sporadic late onset AD in the IGAP meta-analysis. This approach allowed us to demonstrate a significant association of the additive effect of these genetic factors with the sporadic early--onset and familial late--onset AD. In contrast, we would have required larger samples sizes to perform single SNP association tests and reach levels of significance after correcting for multiple tests. This is because the relatively small effect size of the genetic variants identified to sLOAD. The additive effect that additional variants with lower frequency (MAF <5%) associated with AD (i.e. TREM2 [44, 45] , PLD3 [46] , SORL1 [47, 48] or ABCA7 [29, 49] ) still remains to be analyzed in these cohorts.\nOur analysis confirms the hypothesis that the genome--wide significant genetic variants identified for sporadic late onset AD also modulate risk in late--onset familial AD. Furthermore, our analysis showed that the sporadic and familial LOAD participants have similar burden of generic risk factors. However, the samples with a strong family history (fLOAD), independently of the pattern of heritance show the highest percentage of APOE \u03b54 carriers, which is reflected in a higher odd ratio once the effect of this allele is incorporated in the PRS.\nInterestingly, the analysis of the sporadic early onset subjects revealed that the PRS, loaded with genetic factors identified from late onset studies, has a more pronounced effect on individuals with younger age at onset. Indeed, this finding not only indicates that the genetic architecture is shared among sporadic cases but also suggests that age at onset of AD is modulated by the additive effect of these loci. We subsequently confirmed this hypothesis identifying a similar effect for different quintiles of the age at onset ( Supplementary Table 1 ;\nand Supplementary Figure 1 ).\nWe could not identify a significant association of the PRS with the early--onset autosomal dominant AD (eADAD) cohort (DIAN). However this cohort has the smallest number of participants. Our empirical power estimates showed that the sample size of this cohort provides a 98% chances to detect an association with odd ratios comparable to that observed for sEOAD. It is more likely that the lack of association of the PRS with eADAD is not because of statistical power, but because the GWAS loci do not confer risk for this population, characterized by the presence of mutations in APP, PSEN1 and PSEN2 genes. Nonetheless, we identified an association of the PRS with the CSF ptau 181 --A\u03b2 42 ratio; showing that these loci have additional effects on AD pathophysiology most likely in age at onset, but it could also affect disease duration or rate of progression.\nThe genetic profile summarized in the polygenic risk score should help identify individuals with the highest odds for developing AD dementia, which could benefit the selection of candidates to be present in clinical trials; and also to identify novel therapeutic targets that could modulate the age of symptom onset. Our results indicate that individuals with familial history or earlier--onset are enriched for genetic factors which confer higher odd ratios compared to late--onset cases. These findings can have important repercussion in the design of future genetic studies. Selecting AD cases with earlier onset (but not Mendelian Mutations) or strong family history should provide more statistical power than a similar number of sporadic late--onset cases\nOne limitation of this study is that to evaluate the extent of overlap of the genetic architectures among the distinct classification of AD we employed common genome--wide significant and replicated variants. A recent study indicates that the SNPs that are significant for AD risk but do not pass the stringent multiple test correction thresholds of GWA studies, can still be informative for the PRS [17] . Additional studies show that low frequency variants, not analyzed in GWA studies are also associated with sLOAD risk [44, 46] . Therefore, further studies including common and rare variants may provide more accurate estimation of the genetic burden of the sEOAD and familial samples in comparison with the sLOAD.\nIn conclusion, our analysis revealed an overlap among the genetic architecture of the different classifications of AD. The genetic factors identified for sLOAD also affect fLOAD, and sEOAD; with a higher effect size than that observed in the sporadic late--onset form of the disease, and these genetic factors also modulate the age at symptom onset of AD. and through generous contributions from the following: AbbVie, Alzheimer's Association; * The models correct for the sex and contributing study for the Early Onset cohorts and also age at onset or age of last assessment for the Late Onset cohorts. The PRS was analyzed by itself, as well as the effects of APOE genotypes in the cohorts. An extended version of the PRS adds the risk conferred by APOE into the effects. These results are a product of analyzing the tertiles with lowest and highest PRS values and a logistic regression for the entire set of samples in the case of models for APOE and no PRS. "}]
