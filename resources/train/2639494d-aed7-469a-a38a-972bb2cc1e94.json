In this paper, we test the hypothesis that free-water in the hippocampus will be more sensitive to early stages of cognitive decline than hippocampal volume, and that free-water in hippocampus will increase across distinct clinical stages of Alzheimer's disease. We examined two separate cohorts (N=126; N=112) of cognitively normal controls, early and late mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's disease. Demographic, clinical, diffusion-weighted and T1-weighted imaging, and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging were assessed. Results indicated elevated hippocampal free-water in early MCI individuals compared to controls across both cohorts. In contrast, there was no difference in volume of these regions between controls and early MCI. ADNI free-water values in the hippocampus was associated with low CSF AB 1-42 levels and high global amyloid PET values. Free-water imaging of the hippocampus can serve as an early stage marker for AD and provides a complementary measure of AD neurodegeneration using non-invasive imaging."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in older adults, with increasing prevalence in individuals over 70 years of age. AD is characterized typically by memory impairment and neuropathological findings of beta amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (Braak and Braak, 1998) . Although a definitive diagnosis currently cannot be made until autopsy, in-vivo biomarker development has emerged as a powerful tool to monitor disease progression and management (Jack et al., 2010; Jack et al., 1992) including structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques as a clinical tool to identify stages of early cognitive decline and AD (Doherty et al., 2015; Okonkwo et al., 2014) .\nThe hippocampus undergoes atrophic and pathological changes prior to symptomatic onset (Janocko et al., 2012; Mueller and Weiner, 2009 ). The changes that occur in the hippocampus has even been document to impact hippocampal sub-regions differentially (Frisoni et al., 2006) (Padurariu et al., 2012) . Although these differences may be due to the methods of analysis, inclusion criteria, or type of MCI, these studies indicate that characterization of hippocampal degeneration is important in stages of cognitive impairment and AD. Further, the pathological changes due to intraneuronal tau or extracellular accumulation of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) in the hippocampus lead to neuronal shrinkage (Lee et al., 2001) , providing greater increase of the extracellular space.\nDiffusion MRI studies have shown that individuals with MCI or AD have increased hippocampal mean diffusivity (Ashford et al., 2011; Clerx et al., 2012) . Examining microstructural changes may be a more sensitive predictor of clinical decline than macrostructural volume measurements of the hippocampus.

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that free-water within the hippocampus would detect differences among various stages along the AD clinical continuum and correlate with clinical severity. We also examined the extent to which free-water measures of hippocampus correlated with other measures of AD pathophysiological processes. These analyses were carried out sequentially, in two large cohorts for rigorous validation of the findings.\nA C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T 67 ms, flip angle of 90\u00b0, in-plane resolution = 2.7 x 2.7 mm, slice number = 59, and slice thickness = 2.7 mm with no gap and 35 cm field of view. 1Florida ADRC diffusion imaging scans were acquired with a 64 direction echo planar sequence b-value 1000 with 1 b0 image with TR of 9000 ms, TE of 90 ms, flip angle of 90\u00b0, in-plane resolution = 2 x 2 mm, slice number =64, and a slice thickness of 2 mm with no gap (See Table 1 ). ADNI data were acquired from 12 different scanners and 1Florida ADRC data were acquired from 1 scanner.\nThe PET scanner currently used for the 1Florida ADRC has been certified for use in ADNI. A 3D Hoffmann brain phantom was acquired prior to participant enrollment in order to establish a standardized acquisition and reconstruction method. Participants were infused with [18-F] florbetaben 300 MBQ over a 3 min period. Scanning commenced after a period of 60 minutes for a duration of 20 minutes on a Siemens Biograph 16 PET/CT scanner, operating in 3D mode (55 slices/frame, 3mm slice thickness 128 X128 matrix). Acquired PET data were reconstructed into a 128 \u00d7 128 \u00d7 63 (axial) matrix with voxel dimensions of 0.21 \u00d7 0.21 \u00d7 0.24 cm. Reconstruction was performed using manufacturer-supplied software and included corrections for attenuation, scatter, random coincidences and dead time. Images for regional analyses were processed using Fourier analysis followed by direct Fourier reconstruction. Images were smoothed with a 3 mm Hann filter. Following reconstruction, image sets were inspected and, if necessary, corrected for inter-frame motion.\n\n\nA C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T "}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects", "text": "Imaging data for the current study were obtained from 2 databases: 1) the Alzheimer's Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database and 2) the 1Florida Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (1Florida ADRC).

Gradient directions were rotated based on motion corrections. All voxels outside of the brain and eye-\ntissue were subsequently removed from diffusion-weighted images using the Brain Extraction Tool from FSL. Free-water maps were calculated for all subjects; computational routines for free-water have been published elsewhere (Ofori et al., 2015; Pasternak et al., 2009 ). All maps were warped into standardized space using ANTs R routines (Avants et al., 2008; Avants et al., 2014) . First, a linear rigid transformation was performed. Then a diffeomorphic transformation using the Symmetric Normalization (SyN) transformation model was performed. SyN uses a gradient-based iterative convergence using diffeomorphisms to converge on an optimal solution based on a similarity metric (e.g., cross-correlation) (Klein et al., 2009 ). The diffeomorphic transform matrices were then applied to all the free-water maps, for subsequent analyses of hippocampal regions 2.3.1. Volumetric MRI Analysis: Regional analysis was done on the 3D T1 MPRAGE imager with FreeSurfer (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/) (Dale et al., 1999) . This MRI software package is comprised of a suite of automated tools for segmentation, reconstruction, and derivation of regional volumes and surface-based rendering. FreeSurfer 6.0 was used to derive hippocampal volumes. We employed the same software version, workstation, and operating system throughout the study given known variability introduced by these factors.\n2.3.2. PET Imaging Analysis. PET imaging data were downloaded from the ADNI website (https://adni.loni.usc.edu). Signal uptake value ratios (SUVRs) for amyloid-PET were calculated based on previously reported methods . The PET tracer 18 F-florbetapir was used to quantify global amyloid status, calculated by ratios of regions of interest (ROIs) tracer retention to cerebellar and total white matter uptake. The cutoff SUVR value to determine subject status as \"amyloid positive\" was 1.1 using frontal lobe, anterior cingulate, precuneus, and\nparietal cortex relative to cerebellum. More details of the methods for the PET analyses can be found at http://adni.loni.usc.edu/methods/pet-analysis/.\nImages were obtained from the top of the head to the top of the neck and CT data were employed for initial attenuation correction and image reconstruction in the sagittal, axial and coronal planes. The florbetaben PET/CT scans, including the outline of the skull, were coregistered linearly (i.e., trilinear interpolation) with 12 degrees of freedom, onto the volumetric MRI scan using a T1-weighted, (magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo (MP-RAGE)\nsequence. Region-of-interest (ROI) boundaries were manually defined using the structural MRI for anatomical reference and criteria that have been proven to provide highly reproducible outcomes (Desikan et al., 2006) . This registration process ensured that the florbetaben PET/CT image had the same accurate segmentation and parcellation as in the MRI.

For ADNI, there were more amyloid positive and ApoE \u03b54 carriers in the LMCI and AD groups than there were in EMCI and CN (p-values<0.01). For 1Florida ADRC there were more amyloid positive carriers in the AD than EMCI and LMCI groups, and more positive carriers in the EMCI and LMCI than CN.\nIn the ADNI cohort, post-hoc tests revealed lower CDR-SB scores for controls compared to EMCI and LMCI; the AD group had the highest CDR-SB scores (see Table 2 ). Post hoc testing revealed the following pattern of results for MoCA: CN > EMCI > LMCI > AD. MMSE scores were lower for the AD group than the CN, EMCI, and LMCI groups, and higher (better)\nin the CN and EMCI groups than in the LMCI and AD groups (p-values<0.01; see Table 2 ).\nFor the 1Florida ADRC cohort, post-hoc tests revealed lower CDR-SB scores for controls and EMCI when compared with LMCI and AD (see Table 2 ). Post hoc testing revealed that AD MoCA scores were significantly lower than CN, EMCI and LMCI groups. MMSE scores decreased with increases in disease severity with CN having the highest scores and AD having the lowest scores (p-values<0.01; see Table 2 ).\nStatistical analyses also revealed the influence of the site covariate on the continuous demographic variables.

Although longitudinal confirmation would be required, if these findings are confirmed, they may provide a sensitive marker of the effects of therapeutic intervention, similar to the proposed use of free-water in Parkinson's disease (Burciu et al. 2017 ). Postmortem studies demonstrate accumulation of intraneuronal tau in the hippocampus from midlife onward (Braak and Braak, 1998) . This is associated with inflammatory reactions and neuronal atrophy, and potentially larger amounts of extracellular fluid--which in turn may relate to higher free-water content.\nWe note three limitations that could influence the reported results. One, site differences between the cohorts could confound some of the reported results. We did covary for site to minimize this influence however as noted above the influence of site on some demographic and imaging variables requires further study. Further, more comprehensive neuropsychological test data would aid in characterization of the patient status. Finally, baseline data were only included and longitudinal data would help confirm the extent diagnoses, hippocampal imaging findings and potential changes in diagnoses are influenced by cross-sectional differences in the hippocampal free-water.\nThe current study found free-water levels were positively associated with global levels of AV45 and negatively associated with CSF A\u00df42, which correlates negatively with amyloid deposition in the brain (Kang et al., 2013; Verbeek et al., 2009 ). However, free-water levels did not correlate with CSF p-tau or CSF t-tau in our study, suggesting the possibility that the increase in free water levels may reflect amyloid-induced prodromal neurodegenerative changes in the hippocampus occurring prior to the increase in CSF tau. This hypothesis is supported by the known time course of events, which have been validated in longitudinal studies, showing that\nincreases in brain amyloid levels precede increases in CSF tau by a decade or more (Jack et al., 2010) . In summary, our study suggests that free-water values from the hippocampus may reflect a pathophysiological process along the entire AD continuum, in the presence of increased global amyloid deposition, but prior to overt evidence of neurodegeneration in the form of hippocampal atrophy or increased CSF tau increases. We found evidence that hippocampal free-water values served as a very early marker of cognitive impairment with changes detected in EMCI, in two separate large cohorts. We suggest that hippocampal free-water levels provide distinct and sensitive in-vivo information about AD neurodegeneration.

Further, higher levels of free-water were associated with lower scores on the MMSE and the MoCA. These findings support the hypothesis that increased levels of free water in these hippocampal ROIs have functional and clinical relevance in the AD process, and may be among the earliest detectable structural changes. Pyramidal neuron loss within the hippocampus results in the connections to disconnect from their projection areas in the cortex (Davies et al., 1992; Padurariu et al., 2012) . In a previous MRI study, it was reported that the greatest atrophy in the hippocampus occurred shows a systematic decline within the regiony (Frisoni et al., 2006) .\nNonetheless, the current study using diffusion imaging showed the hippocampal free-water values were elevated in EMCI patients. Free-water is suggested to estimate the size of the extracellular space and reflect the degenerative processes that occur in this area. There is some support for the hypothesis that the changes seen within these particular hippocampal regions are due to cholinergic and glutamatergic terminal loss from the nucleus basalis and lamina II of the entorhinal cortex (ERC) respectively (Kordower et al., 2001) . In a previous study demonstrated densities of choline acetyltransferase-positive punctate immunoprecipitates were found to be significantly higher in hippocampal areas for AD (Ransmayr et al., 1992) and that the neurofibrillary pathology first affects lamina II ERC neurons (Braak and Braak, 1991) . The loss of cholinergic modulation in AD may contribute to a decline in memory.\n"}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The current investigation examined the integrity of hippocampal regions by assessing free-water imaging in different stages of AD across ADNI and the 1Florida ADRC. The results indicate that left hippocampal free-water values were elevated in EMCI when compared to CN, across both the ADNI and 1Florida ADRC cohorts. ADNI free-water measures from both hemispheres correlated with clinical cognition scores. In addition, free-water values were associated with global AV45 and CSF AB 1-42 levels and not CSF p-tau and CSF t-tau, suggesting free-water may provide specific information about the pathological process in AD. Thus, the current study suggests that free-water mapping of bilateral hippocampus provides important information of neurodegenerative changes in AD.\nPrevious studies have shown that elevated mean diffusivity (MD) in the hippocampus is a precursor to symptomatic AD and can detect early stage changes of AD . It has been suggested that this elevation in MD is due to increased extracellular water content or decreased gray matter density .\nOur findings extend previous work suggesting diffusion metrics are elevated in the hippocampus, and that they are more sensitive to hippocampal change than volumetric imaging.
