Since 18 F has a half-life of 110 minutes, 18 F-labeled tracers are better suited for general clinical use. 17 Florbetapir F 18 ( 18 F-AV-45) is a PET ligand with high affinity and specificity to A\u2424. 18 A multicenter clinical-histopathologic validation study found a significant correlation between majority visual ratings of florbetapir PET in living subjects and autopsy-measured A\u2424 pathology. 19 Other F 18 amyloid PET tracers are also being developed. 20, 21 One limitation of current F 18 amyloid PET tracers has been the lack of longitudinal data. The present study was designed to examine whether florbetapir PET can predict subsequent cognitive decline in older at-risk subjects.\nMETHODS AV45-A11 (NCT00857506) is a prospective, multicenter, observational study, sponsored by Avid Radiopharmaceuticals (a subsidiary of Eli Lilly), that is being conducted at 21 US clinical sites. It is a longitudinal extension of a cross-sectional phase 2 florbetapir PET study (AV45-A05; NCT00702143), whose results are being reported separately.\nSubjects. Fifty-one subjects with MCI, 69 clinically normal cognitively healthy controls (CN), and 31 subjects clinically diagnosed with AD dementia who had previously received a florbetapir PET scan in the cross-sectional study agreed to participate in this longitudinal observational study. Patients with AD dementia met National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association 22 criteria for probable AD and had Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores \u054524. MCI subjects were presenting for an initial evaluation, or had received a diagnosis of MCI within the past year. They were \u054650 years of age, had a complaint of memory or cognitive impairment corroborated by an informant, had a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale global rating of 0.5, and MMSE \u03fe24; no episodic memory cutoff was required. The CN subjects were \u054650 years of age, assessed clinically as cognitively normal, and had a CDR global of 0 and an MMSE of 29 or 30. CN subjects were recruited approximately equally across age deciles (50 -59, 60 -69, 70 -79, and \u054680 years of age). At screening, all subjects underwent a detailed medical history, physical and neurologic examinations, clinical interview, and laboratory evaluations. An MRI performed at screening or within 6 months prior to enrollment ruled out significant CNS lesions. Subjects were excluded if they had other relevant neuropsychiatric diseases, received antiamyloid investigational drugs, were unable to complete psychometric testing, or had contraindications to PET.\nBaseline assessments. All subjects underwent a clinical diagnostic interview and cognitive/functional battery including the CDR, MMSE, Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog; 11-item version), Wechsler Logical Memory (immediate and delayed recall), Digit-Symbol Substitution, Category Verbal Fluency (animals and vegetables), Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living Scale (ADCS-ADL), and Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). APOE genotyping was performed as an optional procedure, in a doubleblind fashion.\nFlorbetapir PET scan. PET scanners at all sites were qualified using a Hoffman brain phantom. Subjects underwent PET amyloid imaging, as part of AV45-A05, during a 10-minute acquisition (acquired in 2 \u03eb 5 minutes frames), 50 minutes after IV injection of 10 mCi (370 MBq) of florbetapir F 18. Study site PET scanners included ECAT HR\u03e9 (Siemens), Discovery LS PET/CT (General Electric), Biograph PET/CT (Siemens), and Advance PET (GE) models. Images were reconstructed using an iterative reconstruction algorithm (4 iterations, 16 subsets), with a post reconstruction Gaussian filter of 5 mm.\nThree nuclear medicine physicians, blinded to clinical data, independently reviewed all PET images at an imaging core lab (ICON Medical Imaging, Warrington, PA) and rated each on both a semiquantitative (0 -4) and a binary qualitative scale (amyloid positive: A\u2424\u03e9 or amyloid negative: A\u2424\u03ea) based on the pattern of tracer uptake in gray matter cortical areas, as previously described. 19 The majority of the 3 binary ratings was used for analyses in this report. Details of PET methods, visual rater training, and reliability are being reported separately (appendix e-1 on the Neurology \u00ae Web site at www.neurology.org). Two of 3 readers agreed with the majority in more than 96% of cases and the third reader agreed in 74%. The statistic for all 3 raters was 0.58 (binary scale). Cerebral-to-whole-cerebellar florbetapir standard uptake value ratios (SUVr) were also calculated, as previously described. 19, 23 The 2 frames of each image were averaged and normalized to a florbetapir template in Talairach space using SPM-2. No partial volume correction was performed. Previously defined volumes of interest (VOI) representing gray matter regions known to be vulnerable to amyloid deposition in frontal, temporal, and parietal cortices, anterior cingulate, posterior cingulate, and precuneus were used to extract counts for each region. SUVr were calculated using whole cerebellum as the reference region. The average of the SUVr across the 6 cortical target regions was used for analysis.\nFollow-up assessments. Subjects completing the initial PET scan were eligible to participate in the follow-up protocol. The primary objective of the protocol is to determine whether florbetapir F 18 PET predicts progressive cognitive impairment. The current report describes changes in cognitive performance that were found at the 18-month interim timepoint; a final assessment will be obtained at 36 months. Each subject/informant was contacted at 6-month intervals for a brief phone screen and status update. Subjects returned to the clinic 18 months after the original PET scan to undergo a diagnostic interview and cognitive test battery. Upon completion of the diagnostic evaluation, subjects were classified as CN, MCI, AD, or non-AD dementia.\nClinical diagnoses were determined blind to the florbetapir F 18 scan results.\nStandard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient consents. This study (NCT00857506) was approved by the institutional review boards at all participating sites and all subjects or their appropriate representatives provided informed consent.\nStatistical analysis. All statistical tests were 2-sided unless otherwise noted and performed at the 0.05 significance level. Differences between diagnostic groups and A\u2424 status (by binary ratings) on baseline continuous characteristics were assessed with 2-sample t tests; categorical variables were assessed with 2 tests.\nAnalysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models, adjusting for baseline age and cognitive test score, evaluated differences between A\u2424\u03e9 and A\u2424\u03ea subjects with respect to change on cognitive measures between baseline and month 18. To further evaluate the robustness of these findings, correlational analyses were conducted between the baseline SUVr and subsequent change on the cognitive and functional measures adjusting for baseline test performance and age. To evaluate factors other than amyloid classification, additional stepwise regression models were performed in which amyloid classification, baseline score, age, education, and APOE \u24404 carrier status were considered. Variables were entered in a forward fashion and retained in the model if p \u03fd 0.15. For all analyses, last observation carried forward (LOCF) imputation was used if subjects had a postbaseline cognitive assessment; if a subject discontinued the study prior to the scheduled 18-month cognitive follow-up testing and had cognitive testing at the time of discontinuation, these test scores were carried forward to the 18-month timepoint. Analyses used SAS Windows (version 9 or later). The analyses in this report are considered exploratory and the reported p values are unadjusted for multiple comparisons. p Values \u03fd0.05 are considered significant. Since in clinical practice, florbetapir scans will likely be assessed for the presence or absence of amyloid, we considered the ANCOVA model that compares the differences between A\u2424\u03e9 and A\u2424\u03ea of primary importance, and utilized the Benjamani-Hochberg procedure 24 post hoc to control the false discovery rate for this set of comparisons."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS Subject disposition.", "text": "Of the 151 subjects (69 CN, 51 MCI, 31 AD) who entered this longitudinal observational study (figure e-1), 97% of CN, 90% of MCI, and 87% of AD completed 18 months of follow up. The most common reasons for termination were withdrawal of consent (n \u03ed 7) and loss to follow-up (n \u03ed 3). The proportion of study completers did not differ by visual ratings of amyloid status in the AD, MCI, or CN groups ( p \u03ed 0.74, p \u03ed 0.89, p \u03ed 0.55, respectively).\nBaseline florbetapir PET amyloid positivity by diagnosis. Figure 1 depicts illustrative amyloid-positive (A\u2424\u03e9) and -negative (A\u2424\u03ea) PET scans. At entry, 37% (19/51) of subjects with MCI, 14% (10/69) of subjects with CN, and 68% (21/31) of subjects with AD dementia were rated as PET A\u2424\u03e9 ( p \u03fd 0.0001) by the majority read.\nBaseline demographic characteristics and cognitive performance. As expected, there were differences among diagnostic groups in cognitive and functional variables, and subjects with AD dementia were also slightly older (table e-1). Educational level, height, weight, gender, and race distribution did not differ significantly among groups. A\u2424\u03e9 subjects classified by visual ratings tended to be older and have worse cognitive performance at baseline than A\u2424\u03ea subjects (table 1) . Because of these potential differences, we adjusted for baseline score and age in longitudinal statistical models evaluating change by amyloid status.\nFlorbetapir PET and change from baseline to 18 months on cognitive assessments. MCI subjects rated A\u2424\u03e9 showed a significantly greater mean worsening than A\u2424\u03ea rated subjects on almost all cognitive assessments (table 2 and figure 2 ). Among CN subjects, A\u2424\u03e9 classification predicted greater worsening on the ADAS-Cog and CDR-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) ( p \u03fd 0.01). Among subjects with clinically diagnosed AD dementia, A\u2424\u03e9 classification predicted greater decline on the verbal fluency test for animals ( p \u03fd 0.01) and a trend toward greater decline on the MMSE and DSS ( p \u03fd 0.10). In stepwise regression analyses among subjects with MCI, APOE \u24404 carrier status and florbetapir PET amyloid classification were never retained together in the same model (table e-2). The association between amyloid positivity and greater decline was retained in the model for the ADAS ( p \u03ed 0. showing that both cognitively normal subjects and subjects with MCI with higher levels of cortical A\u2424 on PET are at higher risk for future cognitive progression than individuals with lower levels of amyloid after controlling for age and baseline cognitive performance. These findings support the potential utility of florbetapir PET as a predictive biomarker of cognitive decline in at-risk subjects. While additional longer-term confirmatory studies are necessary, this study also provides preliminary support to the proposed research concepts of preclinical AD (in cognitively healthy subjects) 27 and MCI of the Alzheimer type. The present findings also suggest that amyloid PET may have predictive value in MCI for developing AD dementia. Over the course of the 18-month follow-up period, 29% of A\u2424\u03e9 vs 10% of A\u2424\u03ea subjects with MCI converted to AD dementia (20%/ year vs 7%/year, respectively). Rates of conversion from PiB A\u2424\u03e9 MCI to AD dementia have varied in prior studies depending on MCI sampling criteria, duration of follow-up, and PET measurement used. Reported conversion rates include 82% over 3 years, 9 50% over 2 years, 10 67% over 20 months, 12 and 38% over 21 months. 14 The somewhat lower conversion rates in this study among A\u2424\u03e9 individuals need to be interpreted in the context of the sample size and follow-up duration as well as the fact that subjects with MCI in this study were less impaired at baseline compared to subjects with MCI in ADNI. For example, the mean 11-item ADAS-Cog baseline total for 397 subjects with MCI in ADNI-1was 11.5 (www.adni-info.org) compared to 9.4 in our MCI sample. This is likely due to use in this study of different entry criteria and use of more private practice sites that recruit from the community via advertisement (the latter may also account for the lower prevalence of amyloid-positive scans in patients with clinically diagnosed AD dementia, despite the demonstrated sensitivity and specificity of florbetapir for detecting A\u2424 pathology at autopsy). 19 Thus, the subjects with MCI in this study may be at an earlier stage of disease, analogous to those presenting with mild symptoms in a community setting, and for this reason, may require more than 18 months of follow-up to demonstrate a higher conversion rate to AD dementia. The present study has been amended to extend follow-up to 36 months to further test the effect of baseline amyloid status on rates of conversion from MCI to AD dementia at 36 months."}, {"section_title": "2,28", "text": "In contrast to conversion rates, performance on psychometric tests provides an objective measure of cognitive performance, with increased power due to the continuous nature of the data. Subjects with MCI who had a greater amyloid burden showed a statistically significant greater mean worsening of scores over time on psychometric assessments. In very mildly impaired patients with MCI, where conversion to dementia is a relatively distant outcome, the ability to assess risk of cognitive decline (e.g., from mild to more severe MCI) could be clinically useful for making ongoing care recommendations. Such data could also be useful to power secondary prevention clinical trials since the mean decline in MCI A\u2424\u03e9 group on the ADAS-Cog over 18 months was 4.45 points greater than that in A\u2424\u03ea subjects (\u03e93.84 decline vs \u03ea0.61 improvement).\nCN subjects classified as A\u2424\u03e9 worsened significantly more than A\u2424\u03ea CN subjects on the ADASCog and the CDR-SB but not on other assessments. The lack of significant differences seen on the other cognitive instruments and the relatively slower rate of deterioration in the A\u2424\u03e9 CN subjects compared to A\u2424\u03e9 MCI subjects (table 2) are not unexpected. It has been hypothesized that the gap between the first appearance of amyloid plaques of sufficient density to be detected on a PET scan and onset of dementia may be as long as 10 years. 1, 27, 28 Studies of normal subjects that have shown an association between A\u2424 levels as assessed by 11 C-PIB and decline on specific cognitive measures have been longer-term, largely retrospective, observations (e.g., 4 -10 years). 13, 15, 16 It is likely that a much larger sample and follow-up period longer than the 18 months will be required to test for greater declines in the A\u2424\u03e9 CN subjects. Thus, the present data are insufficient to predict whether, or when, cognitive deterioration will occur in individual A\u2424\u03e9 CN subjects.\nSeveral other caveats should be considered when evaluating the present results. First, a positive scan was defined by the majority read of 3 nuclear medi- cine physicians. Although agreement with the majority read was \u03fe95% for 2 of 3 readers, it was only moderate (74%) for the third. Thus, the prognostic value of the majority read may be greater than that obtained by some individual readers in a clinical setting. Conversely, the imaging component of this study was conducted as part of a Phase II trial, prior to the evaluation of florbetapir imaging in patients followed to autopsy. 19 The availability of these autopsy-verified cases for use in development and testing of read criteria and training methods has led to improved inter-rater reliability. Importantly, the majority read classifications with this improved training produced high agreement with the current study majority read classifications, indicating that the current majority reads are reliable (appendix e-1). While majority reads serve a specific purpose in a research setting, in routine clinical practice florbetapir scans are intended to be read by individual nuclear medicine physicians after they undergo online or in-person case-based training. Such training has already begun and available data (appendix e-1; reference 29) indicate that trained individual physician raters can read florbetapir PET scans with acceptable accuracy; however, further experience in practice settings is needed to confirm these initial findings.\nSecond, corrections were not planned for multiple comparisons across the cognitive assessments. Nevertheless, all the ANCOVA findings reported as significant ( p \u03fd 0.05) in the MCI and CN groups survive correction for multiple comparisons by the Benjamini-Hochberg 24 procedure. Our study did not collect other biomarker data and cannot assess the relative utility of PET vs other biomarkers. PET data from ongoing studies, such as ADNI 3 and anti-amyloid drug trials, 30 may help clarify some of these issues. Too few subjects with MCI were taking AD medications to assess the potential effect of these medications on cognitive decline.\nOur findings and other reports suggest that amyloid PET tracers may have promise for indicating risk of subsequent cognitive decline in patients with MCI and CN older adults. Longitudinal PET and cognitive data may help clarify its prognostic role in the clinical setting, its ability to improve confidence in the recently proposed diagnoses of dementia and MCI due to AD, and for subject enrichment of therapeutic trials in the early clinical and preclinical stages of AD."}, {"section_title": "AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS", "text": "P.M.D. served as the primary author of the manuscript, advised on study design, assisted with data collection, drafted the initial version of the man- Figure 3 Correlation between baseline florbetapir standardized uptake value ratio (SUVr) (averaged across 6 brain regions) and change from baseline to 18 months on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale (ADAS) and Digit Symbol Substitution (DSS) in subjects with mild cognitive impairment\nThe correlations are not adjusted for other variables.
