It begins with a description of the enrollment patterns of these students. It then examines the reasons students reported for choosing the institution they attended and how the reasons varied according to student characteristics. Students at 4-year institutions are considered first, then students at public 2-year institutions. The report also describes student satisfaction with various aspects of their educational experiences such as their intellectual growth, the price of attending, and the prestige of the school. The report uses data from the 1995-96 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:96), a nationally representative study of students enrolled in all types of postsecondary institutions, from 4-year colleges and universities to less-than-2-year vocational institutions. NPSAS provides detailed information on students' backgrounds, their education expenses, and the sources and types of financial aid they receive. The study has been conducted four times-1986-87,1989-90,1992-93, and 1995-96and will be conducted again in 1999-2000. The analysis conducted for this report was limited to students who enrolled in postsecondary education for the first time during the 1995-96 academic year. These students, who constitute the basis for the Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS:96/98), were the only ones asked about reasons for selecting their institutions. The estimates presented in the report were produced using the NPSAS:96 Undergraduate Data Analysis System (DAS). The DAS is a microcomputer application that allows users to specify and generate their own tables. This software system produces the design-adjusted standard errors necessary for testing the statistical significance of differences among estimates. Additional details are included in appendix B of this report, including how readers can obtain access to the DAS through the Internet.

of options. They can choose a baccalaureate program at a 4-year college or university, a certificate or an associate's degree program at a 2-year college, or a vocational program at a 2-year or less-than-2-year institution. They can attend a local institution, living at home or on their own; choose an in-state institution away from home; or move to a completely different part of the country. Depending on where students choose to enroll and live, the amount they pay for their education can vary widely. They may spend as little as a few hundred dollars for tuition, fees, and books if they attend a public 2-year institution and live at home, or more than $25,000 for tuition, room, and board if they attend certain private, not-for-profit institutions and live on campus. As a practical matter, students' choices are constrained in a number of ways. In making their choices, students must take into account what they want to study relative to what different institutions offer, the admissions practices of the institutions they would like to attend, their financial resources, the availability of financial aid, and any family or work responsibilities that require them to live in a particular location or take classes on certain days or at certain times. Their choices may also be affected by family, school, and societal expectations about appropriate alternatives.' Even within these bounds, however, students typically still have options, although a single student from a wealthy family usually has a wider range of alternatives than a student with a family, a job, and limited financial resources. What factors do prospective students take into consideration when deciding where to enroll? How do these factors vary with demographic, socioeconomic, and other student characteristics? Are students satisfied with their choices? These are the questions addressed in this report for students who enrolled in postsecondary education for the first time in 1995-96. Because the analysis includes only individuals who actually enrolled in postsecondary education, it can address the reasons students chose specific institutions, but not the reasons individuals chose to enroll or not enroll in postsecondary education.\n\nStudents' satisfaction with their choices can have implications for their persistence and attainment. Research suggests that whether or not a student stays enrolled in an institution is related to the degree to which the student fits in with the environmentthat is, how the student engages with the academic and social systems of the institution and the extent to which the student is satisfied with institutional resources.7 Thus, measures of students' satisfaction with various aspects of their institution can be useful to those concerned about increasing persistence and attainment in general or of specific subgroups (nontraditional students, for example, who tend have lower attainment rates than traditional students who enter college immediately after high school).8\nIn this analysis, linear regression models were used to describe how a number of student characteristics were related to the reasons students mentioned as being most important in selecting the institution they were attending."}, {"section_title": "The Choice Process", "text": "The approach students use to choose an institution has been described by many researchers as a three-stage process: it begins with a broad overview of postsecondary education opportunities available, followed by a search for information about possible institutions to form a choice set, and then a final choice phase when the student narrows the choice set down to a single institution.2 Various institutional characteristics consistently have been found to be influential during this process, such as cost, distance from home, availability of financial aid (especially grants), and selectivity, as have student characteristics such as gender, raceethnicity, parents ' education, income, parental preferences, religion, and academic ability.3 Several NCES reports have examined the importance of various factors affecting student choice and how these factors vary with age and income. A study using the 1989-90 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:90) data found that the following were very important considerations for students in selecting an institution: the institution offered the course of study they wanted (cited by 73 percent); they could live at home (51 percent); they were able to go to school while working (51 percent); the institution had a good reputation (50 percent); and the institution was located close to home (43 percent).4 Except for the institution's reputation, older students (24 years or older) were more likely than younger students to consider each of these factors important. For low-income students, obtaining the financial aid they needed was especially likely to be a very important consideration (45 percent reported that it was very important, versus 20 percent of other students).5 Although about 65 percent of all high school graduates now enroll in college immediately after graduating from high schoo1,6 and more enroll later on, not all students have equal access to the range of educational opportunities available, and not all postsecondary institutions provide the same programs. Thus, both where students enroll and why have important implications for understanding who receives what types of benefits of postsecondary education."}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "This study uses data on 1995-96 beginning postsecondary students (those who enrolled in postsecondary education for the first time in 1995-96), a subset of the 1995-96 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:96). NPSAS:96 is based on a nationally representative sample of all students enrolled in postsecondary education in 1995-96. Students were asked in a telephone interview why they decided to attend the institution in which they enrolled, and they could provide as many reasons as they wanted. The interviewers coded their verbatim responses into 20 predetermined categories developed using information gathered from field tests. These 20 categories were then aggregated into four general categories as follows: After they gave all their reasons for selecting their institution, students were asked which of the reasons they mentioned was the most important in selecting the institution they were attending. From this information, a variable was created with 20 categories corresponding to the reasons listed above. For this analysis, these 20 values were grouped into the four aggregated categories indicated above. Beginning postsecondary students were also asked to indicate if they were satisfied (yes or no) with various aspects of their first-year experiences in postsecondary education. These aspects fell into three general categories: 1) institutional characteristics, including the prestige of the institution, the overall campus climate regarding students of different racial or ethnic backgrounds, and the price of attending; 2) classroom instruction, including the availability of courses, class sizes, and the teaching ability of most of the instructors; and 3) students' personal experiences, including their intellectual growth and social life. In addition, students were asked if they had participated in certain school-sponsored activities or used certain services including job placement services; sports and recreational facilities; counseling services for academic, financial aid, or personal issues; and music, art, and drama activities. If so, they were asked if they had been satisfied with them. This study relies primarily on tabular analysis, disaggregating student college choice behavior and student satisfaction with postsecondary experiences by their demographic and enrollment characteristics. It examines separately students who enrolled in public 4-year institutions; private, not-for-profit 4-year institutions; and public 2-year institutions. This type of analysis provides useful information in determining overall patterns among different groups of students who enrolled in postsecondary education for the first time in 1995-96. However, it does not take into account the covariation of the independent variables. Several statistical methods are available to examine the relationships between two variables while holding other variables constant."}, {"section_title": "Organization of the Report", "text": "The next section of this report describes the enrollment patterns of the 1995-96 beginning postsecondary students and profiles the students who selected public and private, not-for-profit 4year institutions and public 2-year institutions.

A conclusion summarizes the major findings."}, {"section_title": "Enrollment Patterns", "text": "As background to the discussion of the reasons students gave for choosing their institutions, this section describes where 1995-96 beginning postsecondary students enrolled, first considering all students and then traditional and nontraditional students separately. It then profiles the beginning student population at each of the three major types of institutions: public 4-year; private, not-for-profit 4-year; and public 2-year.\n\n\nEighty-eight percent enrolled full time (table 3). Women outnumbered men (54 percent were female), and 72 percent of all beginning postsecondary students at public 4-year institutions were white, non-Hispanic. Black, non-Hispanics made up 11 percent of the beginning postsecondary student population at public 4-year institutions; Hispanics, 10 percent; and Asian/Pacific Islanders, 7 percent. About two-thirds of the students had parents with at least some postsecondary education, and 21 percent of them had parents with an advanced degree (figure 3). Dependent beginning postsecondary students at public 4-year institutions came from families in all income ranges: 29 percent were from families with incomes less than $30,000; 44 percent were from families with incomes between $30,000 and $69,999; and 27 percent were from families with incomes of $70,000 or more. About one-third (32 percent) of all beginning postsecondary students at public 4-year institutions (dependent and independent) attended with no financial aid (table 3). Another 28 percent received an aid package without loans (that is, they received grants and/or work study only), and the remaining 41 percent had an aid package with loans (table 3). The majority of students (61 percent) worked while enrolled. Of these students, 87 percent considered themselves primarily students working to meet their expenses rather than employees who enrolled to take classes.\n(about 91 percent). Beginning students at both types of institutions were about equally likely to work while enrolled (about 6 out of 10), and, if they worked, to consider themselves primarily students working to meet expenses (about 9 out of 10). Their family backgrounds differed slightly, however. Beginning postsecondary students at private, not-for-profit 4-year institutions were more likely than those at public 4-year institutions to come from families with incomes of $70,000 or more (if they were dependent) and more likely to have parents with an advanced degree. In 1995-96, the average tuition was higher at private, not-for-profit than at public 4-year institutions.12 Dependent students at private, not-for-profit 4-year institutions were more likely than their counterparts at public 4-year institutions to come from high-income families, but students at private, not-for-profit 4-year institutions (dependent and independent together) were less likely than those at public 4-year institutions to attend without aid (19 percent versus 32 percent) (table 3). Beginning students at the two types of 4-year institutions were about equally likely to receive an aid package without loans (about one-quarter), but students at private, not-for-profit institutions were more likely than those at public institutions to take out loans (55 percent versus 41 percent)."}, {"section_title": "All Students", "text": "The type of institution a prospective student chooses depends to a large extent on his or her educational goals. These goals might include earning a formal award such as a bachelor's degree, an associate's degree, or a certificate; obtaining job skills through course enrollment; or pursuing personal interests. Individuals who want to earn a bachelor's degree typically enroll in a 4-year college or university if they have taken the required steps toward admission and have the necessary financial resources. These steps include successfully completing college preparatory courses in high school, taking college entrance examinations (the SAT or ACT) when required, completing the application process, and being accepted for admission.9 About 40 percent of undergraduates of all ages who enrolled in postsecondary education for the first time in 1995-96 decided on a public or private, not-for-profit 4-year institution (table 1). A greater proportion enrolled in public rather than private, not-for-profit institutions (25 percent versus 15 percent) (figure 1). Prospective students who aspire to a bachelor's degree but have missed one of the required steps for admission or cannot afford to attend a 4-year institution can still reach their goal. They can make up their academic deficiencies, complete the required steps, and assemble the financial resources later, or they can enroll first at a 2-year institution and then transfer to a 9For a discussion of access based on taking these steps, see L.

For this analysis, nontraditional characteristics included delaying enrollment into postsecondary education after high school for a year or more; having no high school diploma or having a GED; enrolling part time; being financially independent; having dependents other than a spouse; being a single parent; and working full time while enrolled.11 Students were characterized as traditional if they had none of these characteristics, minimally nontraditional if they had one, moderately nontraditional if they had two or three, and highly nontraditional if they had four or more. In the aggregate, 43 percent of beginning postsecondary students were traditional; 19 percent were minimally nontraditional; 21 percent were moderately nontraditional; and 17 percent were highly nontraditional (table 3). Among traditional beginning postsecondary students, 67 percent enrolled in a 4-year institution (figure 2). Another 16 percent enrolled in a less-than-4-year institution but planned to transfer later to a 4-year institution. Thus, in total, at least three-quarters either attended or expected eventually to attend a 4-year institution. Beginning postsecondary students who were minimally nontraditional were about half as likely as traditional students to attend a 4-year institution (35 percent), and moderately and highly nontraditional students were even less likely to do so (15 percent and 11 percent, respectively). Some minimally and moderately nontraditional beginning postsecondary students enrolled first in less-than-4-year institutions intending to transfer to 4-year institutions later (25 and 20 percent, respectively), but relatively few highly nontraditional students had such aspirations (9 percent). Among the highly nontraditional beginning postsecondary students, 45 percent enrolled in a lessthan-4-year institution with the objective of obtaining job skills.   Public 4-year institutions serve a primarily traditional student population: 70 percent of the 1995-96 beginning postsecondary students who enrolled in a public 4-year institution were traditional, and another 18 percent were minimally nontraditional (that is, had just one characteristic associated with nontraditional status) (table 3). About 95 percent were under 24 years of age, and 91 percent were financially dependent on their parents for financial aid purposes (figure 3)."}, {"section_title": "Private, Not-for-Profit 4-Year Institutions", "text": "Beginning postsecondary students at private, not-for-profit 4-year institutions were similar in many ways to their public sector counterparts (table 3 and figure 3).

For these reasons, they often serve individuals who have family or work responsibilities that limit the amount of time they have to attend classes and the financial resources they have to support their attendance. Beginning postsecondary students at public 2-year institutions were much more likely than students at either public or private, not-for-profit 4-year institutions to have characteristics associated with \"nontraditional\" college students. Specifically, students at public 2-year institutions were more likely to be 24 years or older, single parents, financially independent of their parents for financial aid purposes, and enrolled part time (table 3 and figure 3). They were also more likely to have parents with no more than a high school education. If they worked, they were more likely than students at 4-year institutions to consider themselves primarily employees taking classes than students working to meet expenses. If they were dependent, students at public 2-year 12In 1995-96, the average tuition for students who attended full time, full year was $12,600 at private, not-for-profit 4-year institutions, and $3,800 at public 4-year institutions.

Enrollment Patterns institutions were more likely than those at private, not-for-profit 4-year institutions to be from families with lower incomes (less than $30,000). Beginning postsecondary students enrolled in public 2-year institutions for a variety of reasons. Thirty-seven percent planned to transfer to a 4-year institution, the most frequent reason for enrolling (table 3). Another 23 percent enrolled to obtain job skills, and 21 percent planned to earn a degree or certificate at the 2-year institution. The remaining 19 percent enrolled for other reasons such as personal enrichment or to transfer to an institution other than a 4-year one. Once students decide on the type of postsecondary education they are going to pursue, they must next identify a set of institutions that might meet their needs and then finally narrow this set down to a single institution. They make this choice based on their individual preferences and financial circumstances, constrained of course by the admissions decisions of the institutions to which they apply.13 The rest of this report focuses on the reasons why beginning postsecondary students at public 4-year, private, not-for-profit 4-year, and public 2-year institutions chose the institutions they attended."}, {"section_title": "Choosing a 4-Year Institution", "text": "In NPSAS:96, beginning postsecondary students were asked why they decided to attend their institution. As described in the Introduction, their verbatim responses were coded into 20 categories. These 20 categories were then aggregated into four: reputation/school-related, location-related, price-related, and influence-related. Students could give more than one reason for their choice of institution. The specific reasons students at 4-year institutions gave and how the reasons varied by type of institution and student characteristics are described in this section. Also discussed is the extent to which students were satisfied with various aspects of the institutions they attended.\n\n\nAt private, not-for-profit 4-year institutions, dependent students from families with incomes of at least $70,000 were more likely than those with incomes from $30,000 to 69,999 to cite liking the campus as a reason for choosing their institution (24 percent versus 17 percent). At this upper income level ($70,000 or more), students from public and private, not-for-profit 4-year institutions were about equally likely to cite liking the campus as a reason for choosing their institution (21 and 24 percent, respectively). At private, not-for-profit 4-year institutions, students with SAT scores of 1200 or more were more likely than those with scores of less than 900 to cite liking the campus as a reason for their choice of institution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, beginning postsecondary students at public 4-year institutions were more likely than their counterparts at private, not-for-profit 4-year institutions to be satisfied with the campus climate regarding students of different racial or ethnic backgrounds (90 percent versus 83 percent). The most notable difference was in students' satisfaction with the price of attending. While 78 percent of students at public 4-year institutions were satisfied, 51 percent were satisfied at private, not-for-profit 4-year institutions."}, {"section_title": "Factors Affecting Choice", "text": "The majority (63 percent) of beginning postsecondary students at 4-year institutions gave at least one reputation/school-related reason for choosing their institution (figure 4). A majority also cited at least one location-related reason (58 percent). A considerably smaller percentage (26 percent) gave reasons related to price, and even fewer (21 percent) mentioned the influence of friends, teachers, counselors, or others. The relatively low mention given to the price of attending does not support the findings of other researchers that the price of going to college affects not only whether students enroll but also where they go.\" In addition, the rising public concern over college tuition15 makes it difficult to conclude that the price of attending is not a factor in students' college decisions. One possible explanation for the relatively low percentage of students mentioning price is that in developing their \"choice set,\" students include only those institutions they think they can afford or that their parents had identified as affordable. They may have answered the question about reasons for choosing their institution in the context of making a final choice from the set of institutions that had already been narrowed down to those they considered as financially feasible to attend. It is also possible that, at least for some students, financial aid provided sufficient assistance that they were indifferent to price differences among the institutions they were considering.  \nLocation was especially important to beginning postsecondary students at public 2-year institutions, with 61 percent mentioning at least one location-related reason for choosing their institution ( figure 6 and table 15). Students mentioned location-related reasons more often than any other type of reason, followed by reputation/school-related reasons (43 percent) (table 16) and price-related reasons (33 percent) (table 17). Influence-related reasons were mentioned least often (17 percent) (table 18). Much of the variation in students' reasons for choosing their particular public 2-year institution was related to their reasons for enrolling (job skills, degree or certificate, transfer, or other reason) or whether the students considered themselves primarily students working to pay their educational expenses or employees taking classes. These patterns are described in this section. "}, {"section_title": "100", "text": "Finally, the percentage of students citing price reasons may understate the percentage considering the price of attending because of the way in which students articulated the reasons for their choices. For example, some location-related reasons (living at home, for example) may actually indicate price concerns, because living at home while enrolled is a way of reducing the price of attending. The fact that relatively few students reported the influence of others as being a factor in their decision is somewhat inconsistent with the observed importance of parents, high school personnel, and community values in determining where students go to college.16 As with pricerelated reasons, however, influence factors may play a prominent role in determining whether an individual goes to college and the set of alternatives a student considers, but may be less important in his or her final choice. Students who have defined their options as a set of state universities, for example, or a set of private colleges where they are likely to be admitted, might have had parents, teachers, and guidance counselors help them in identifying this group of institutions. However, they may view their final choice of a specific institution as their own, determined by other considerations. Also, influence factors, like price factors, might be partially reflected in other responses (like being close to home). Students who enrolled at public and private, not-for-profit 4-year institutions tended to use different criteria to pick the institution they attended. The frequency with which students mentioned various reasons for selecting their institution and the most important reasons they reported also differed according to their family background, enrollment characteristics, financial aid status, and work status. These patterns are discussed next."}, {"section_title": "Reputation/School-Related Reasons", "text": "Some students using reputation as a criterion for deciding to attend a particular institution have in mind its general reputation as a high-quality institution. Other students have more specific reputation/school-related reasons for their choices. For example, they might focus on the reputation of the faculty, campus facilities, or the availability of particular programs or majors. Similarly, students with well-defined academic interests might focus on an institution's offerings and reputation in their anticipated major field of study. Students might also choose an institution partly because of the way instruction is organizedclass sizes or the types of course-taking requirements, for example. As already indicated, 63 percent of all beginning postsecondary students at 4-year institu-tiOns cited at least one reputation/school-related reason for their choice of institution (table 4). Thirty-five percent reported that the institution's good reputation was a factor in their decision, and 28 percent reported \"other\" reputation/school-related reasons. As just described, these other reasons might include the institution's program offerings in a specific area or its teaching methods, for example. Relatively small percentages mentioned other reputation/school-related characteristics such as faculty, facilities, or job placement (no more than 6 percent). Beginning postsecondary students attending private, not-for-profit 4-year institutions were especially likely to give a reputation-related reason for choosing their institution compared with those attending public 4-year institutions (74 percent versus 57 percent). They were also more likely than their counterparts at public 4-year institutions to mention each of the specific reputation-related reasonsthe school's good reputation, facilities, faculty reputation, and job placementand also \"other\" reputation/school-related reasons.  Considering an institution's reputation as a good school was associated with having welleducated parents and high admission test scores. At both types of 4-year institutions, students whose parents had an advanced degree were more likely than those whose parents had no more than a high school diploma to cite this reason. Also, at both types of institutions, students with high SAT and ACT scores (1200 or more and 25 or more, respectively) were more likely than those with low scores (less than 900 or less than 19, respectively) to mention the school's good reputation as a reason for choosing it.\nOverall, 43 percent of the beginning postsecondary students attending public 2-year institutions mentioned a reputation/school-related reason for choosing their institution (table 16). Their specific considerations are difficult to know, because an \"other\" reputation/school-related reason was cited more often (by 25 percent) than any of the other types of reputation reasons. As indicated earlier, this \"other\" category might include reasons such as the institution's program offerings in a particular area or its instructional methods. Beginning students at public 2-year institutions were much less likely than their counterparts at 4-year institutions to choose their institution on the basis of its reputation as a good school (14 percent versus 35 percent of students at 4-year institutions) (tables 16 and 4). Although the percentage of beginning postsecondary students at public 2-year institutions mentioning the institution's reputation for job placement as a reason for choosing their institution was relatively small overall (4 percent), it was notably more important to some kinds of students than others (table 16). Concern with the institution's reputation for job placement was greatest among students whose reason for enrolling was to obtain job skills. Twelve percent of such students mentioned the institution's reputation for job placement as a reason for choosing their institution, compared with no more than 3 percent of those enrolling for any other reason. Students enrolled at public 2-year institutions who had certain characteristics (often associated with enrolling for job skills, table 2) were also particularly likely to mention the institution's reputation for job placement: being more than 24 years old, independent, a single parent, enrolled part time, and primarily an employee (table 16)."}, {"section_title": "Location-Related Reasons", "text": "Location-related reasons can include proximity or distance. Some students who cite location as a factor in their choice of institution may be looking for an institution close to their home or job because family or work responsibilities make convenient access to a campus crucial. Others may want to remain close to home to maintain close ties with their family and friends or to be assured that they could get home quickly and inexpensively for vacations or in case of emergency. Other students focusing on location might be looking for an institution far away from home for the experience of living on campus or on their own. Some students may have very specific location criteria and want to be in a particular part of the country or in a location that affords them ready access to desired amenities such as recreational opportunities or cultural activities. A majority (58 percent) of beginning postsecondary students at 4-year institutions gave at least one location-related reason for choosing their institution (table 5). The most frequently cited reason was being close to home (given by 32 percent). Similar reasonsbeing able to live at home or being close to their jobwere given by 5 percent and 1 percent of the students, respectively.17 Sixteen percent cited liking the campus as a reason for choosing their institution, and 12 percent reported an \"other\" location-related reason. Location was more likely to be a factor in choosing an institution for students attending public 4-year institutions (63 percent) than for those attending private, not-for-profit 4-year institutions (50 percent). Compared with students at private, not-for-profit 4-year institutions, students at public 4-year institutions were more likely to mention being close to home (38 percent versus 21 percent) and being able to live at home (7 percent versus 3 percent) as factors in their choice of institution. However, students at private, not-for-profit 4-year institutions gave one particular location-related reasonliking the campusslightly more often than their public 4year counterparts (18 percent versus 14 percent). 171t is important to keep in mind that students could have given more than one of these reasons. Thus, these percentages cannot be added together to indicate the percentage who gave proximity as a reason. 3. Choosing a 4-Year Institution Specific location-related reasons varied with income among dependent students at both public and private, not-for-profit 4-year institutions. At public 4-year institutions, dependent students were about equally likely to have a location-related reason for choosing their institution regardless of income, but their reasons differed. Compared with those in other income categories, dependent students from families with incomes of at least $70,000 were more likely to choose their institutions because they liked the campus, and less likely to want to be close to home.\nIn contrast to 4-year institutions, which often attract students from a wide geographic area and sometimes compete for students in a national or even international market, public 2-year institutions tend to serve a local constituency. As already indicated, a majority (61 percent) of the 1995-96 beginning postsecondary students at public 2-year institutions mentioned at least one location-related reason for choosing their institution. Forty-six percent gave being close to home as a reason, and 10 percent mentioned being able to live at home (students could have given both reasons) (table 15).   While students at public 2-year and 4-year institutions were about equally likely to have location-related reasons for choosing their institution, their particular location concerns were different (tables 15 and 5). For example, students at public 2-year institutions were much more likely to mention being close to home as a reason for choosing their institution (46 percent versus 32 percent) or living at home (10 percent versus 5 percent), while students at 4-year institutions were much more likely to report that they liked the campus (16 percent versus 4 percent) or had \"other\" location-related reasons (12 percent versus 3 percent). Within the beginning postsecondary student population at public 2-year institutions, the specific location reasons students cited varied according to whether they considered themselves primarily students or employees. Comparing the two groups, those who considered themselves primarily students were more likely to mention being close to home (52 percent versus 41 4. Choosing a Public 2-Year Institution percent), and those who considered themselves primarily employees were more likely to mention being close to their job (7 percent versus 2 percent) (table 15)."}, {"section_title": "Price-Related Reasons", "text": "As discussed earlier, the price of attending may help define the set of institutions students consider to be open to them, with students seriously considering only those institutions they think they can afford. Only students from wealthy families or who have other sources of funds or are awarded substantial amounts of financial aid can afford to ignore price completely in making their decisions. In fact, research on price and choice has shown that as net prices rise, the enrollment of lower income students tends to shift to less expensive colleges.18 About one-quarter (26 percent) of all beginning postsecondary students at 4-year institutions gave at least one price-related reason for choosing their institution (table 6). This reason was expressed in general termssome version of \"the price of attending was less\"by 11 percent of students. Seven percent of students specifically mentioned that they got more financial aid, and 5 percent mentioned lower tuition. Price-related reasons were mentioned much more often by students attending public as opposed to private, not-for-profit 4-year institutions (31 percent versus 18 percent). Furthermore, students at the two types of institutions had different price considerations. Of the various types of price-related reasons, students at public 4-year institutions were most likely to give a general 3. Choosing a 4-Year Institution  3. Choosing a 4-Year Institution reasonsome version of \"the price of attending was less\" (15 percent). In contrast, students at private, not-for-profit 4-year institutions mentioned getting financial aid more often than any other price-related reason (11 percent). Among dependent beginning postsecondary students at public 4-year institutions, similar percentages in each income group gave a price-related reason for attending their institution (29 to 34 percent). Previous research cited aboveo might suggest that price would be considered more often by lower income families. However, as already suggested, students may have reported their reasons for choosing from a narrow range of options. Price may have been an important consideration at the point in the decision process when realistic options were being identified, but less important at the final decision stage. In addition, financial aid serves to equalize financial resources for college across income levels.20 Furthermore, perceptions of affordability are subjective. For example, a lower income family might be willing to make enormous sacrifices to cover the price of their child's attending a specific college and therefore consider it affordable, while another family, wealthier but with different spending priorities, considers it unaffordable.21 Also, the extent to which specific prices are a concern for families at particular income levels will depend on whether they saved for college as well as on their income. A family with a modest income that began saving early might not have to be as concerned about price as a family with a higher income but no savings. At private, not-for-profit 4-year institutions, dependent students from families with incomes less than $70,000 were more likely than those from higher income families to cite a price-related reason (21 percent versus 14 percent). The major difference was in the percentage who cited getting more financial aid as a reason for their choice of institution. However, since students from families with incomes of $70,000 or more are not eligible for as much financial aid as those with lower incomes, it is logical that financial aid receipt would be less of a consideration in their choice.\nOne-third of the beginning postsecondary students at public 2-year institutions mentioned a price-related reason for choosing their institution (table 17). Nineteen percent expressed their reason in general terms (some form of \"the price of attending was less\"), and 8 percent specifically mentioned tuition. Students planning to transfer (37 percent of beginning postsecondary students at public 2-year institutions, table 2) were particularly likely to mention a price-related reason (39 percent). They were more likely to do so than students who enrolled to obtain job skills (25 percent) or for \"other\" reasons (27 percent). Included in this group would be any 4. Choosing a Public 2-Year Institution  beginning students with bachelor's degree aspirations who were starting at a public 2-year institution to reduce the total price of attaining that degree. Also particularly likely to cite a price-related reason for choosing their institution were students with characteristics associated with traditional student status: being less than 24 years of age, being financially dependent, enrolling full time, and working but considering themselves primarily students as opposed to employees. Traditional status was also associated with a transfer goal: almost half (48 percent) of traditional students and 38 percent of minimally nontraditional students at less-than-4-year institutions were intending to transfer to a 4-year institution (table 2).  "}, {"section_title": "Influence-Related Reasons", "text": "The percentages of beginning postsecondary students at public and private, not-for-profit 4year institutions who mentioned an influence-related reason for choosing their institution were similar (20 and 22 percent, respectively) (table 7).

Choosing a 4-Year Institution institutions and 5 percent of students at private, not-for-piofit 4-year institutions mentioned specifically that the fact that friends or spouses attended the institution was a factor, but for the most part, students in both types of institutions gave reasons in the \"other\" influence-related category. That is, they were influenced by individuals or things other than parents, friends, teachers, or counselors. Other individuals with influence might include, for example, siblings; coaches; employers; or alumni, faculty, or admissions staff connected with institutions. Other things students might have been influenced by include informational materials or recruiting activities sponsored by institutions. Students who attended private, not-for-profit 4-year institutions were slightly more likely than those in public 4-year institutions to report this \"other\" influence reason (14 percent versus 10 percent).\nOverall, 17 percent of beginning postsecondary students enrolling in a public 2-year institution chose that institution at least partly because someone influenced them or they were responding to some other type of influence (such as advertising or informational materials) (table  18). Most commonly mentioned was an \"other\" influence (10 percent), followed by friends attending the school (5 percent). Students attending for personal or \"other\" reasons were more likely to give an \"other\" influence reason than were students enrolling for a degree or to transfer (17 percent versus 7 percent). 7 0 4. Choosing a Public 2-Year Institution  "}, {"section_title": "Most Important Reason", "text": "In addition to being asked to enumerate the reasons they chose the institution they attended, 1995-96 beginning postsecondary students were also asked to identify the most important reason for their choice. Students at both public and private, not-for-profit 4-year institutions were more likely to cite reputation/school-related reasons for choosing their institution than they were to cite location, price, or influence ( figure 5 and table 8). However, students at public 4-year institutions were more likely than those at private, not-for-profit 4-year institutions to identify location or price as most important. The most important reason for selecting an institution varied by student characteristics (such as family income and parents' education) as well as by sector (public or private, not-forprofit), and many of these characteristics are interrelated. Therefore, multivariate analyses were conducted to take into account this covariation. Tables 9-11 show the percentages of students at 4-year institutions who cited reputation/school-, location-, or price-related reasons as the most important considerations in choosing their institutions and the adjusted percentages after taking into account the covariation of the variables listed in the table. The results are summarized in table 12. Multivariate analysis confirmed that, after controlling for student characteristics, beginning postsecondary students at private, not-for-profit 4-year institutions were more likely than those at public 4-year institutions to give a reputation/school-related reason as the most important consideration in choosing where to enroll (table 9). Certain student background characteristics were associated with considering reputation to be most important as well. These included having a family income of $70,000 or more (if dependent) compared to an income of less than $30,000, and having parents with some postsecondary education (although not a degree) compared to a 3.

Finally, students who enrolled full time were more likely than those who enrolled part time to identify a reputation/school-related reason as the most important. Again controlling for student characteristics, beginning postsecondary students at public 4year institutions were still more likely than those at private, not-for-profit 4-year institutions to give a location reason as most important in choosing their institution (table 10). Students whose parents had a high school education or less were more likely than those whose parents had more education to consider location most important. So were students from families with incomes less than $30,000 compared with those from families with incomes of $30,000-69,999. Students with a combined score of less than 900 on their SAT tests were more likely than those with a score of 1200 or higher to consider location most important, as were part-time students compared to fulltime students, and unaided students compared to students with loans.

The multivariate analysis also confirmed that after controlling for student characteristics, beginning postsecondary students at public 4-year institutions were still more likely than those at private, not-for-profit 4-year institutions to consider price the most important reason for choosing their institutions (table 11). Price as the most important reason was also associated with a combined SAT score of 900 or more compared with a lower score. Compared with students with loan aid, aided students without loans were more likely to consider price as the most important reason for choosing their institutions, while unaided students were less likely to do so.\nIn contrast to beginning postsecondary students at 4-year institutions, who considered the institution's reputation the most important reason for choosing their institution (figure 5), students at public 2-year institutions were about as likely to cite location as reputation (35 percent and 33 percent, respectively) (figure 7). Price was cited as most important somewhat less often (24 percent). However, beginning students at public 2-year institutions were more likely than those at 4-year institutions to consider price the most important reason (24 percent versus 16 percent) (tables 19 and 8). As was done for students beginning at 4-year institutions, multivariate analyses were conducted to determine which student characteristics were associated with identifying specific reasons as most important for choosing an institution. Tables 20-22 show the percentages of students at public 2-year institutions who cited reputation/school-, location-, or price-related reasons as the most important reasons for choosing their institutions and the adjusted percentages after taking into account the covariation of the variables in the table. Students who considered themselves to be primarily employees were more likely than those who considered themselves to be primarily students to cite reputation as the most important reason for choosing their institution, as were older students (24 years or older) compared to younger students (18 years or younger) (table 20).
