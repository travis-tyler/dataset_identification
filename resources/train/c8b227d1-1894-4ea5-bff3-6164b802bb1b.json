[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Different neurodegenerative diseases can cause memory disorders and other cognitive impairments. The early detection and the stratification of patients according to the underlying disease are essential for an efficient approach to this healthcare challenge. This emphasizes the importance of differential diagnostics. Most studies compare patients and controls, or Alzheimer's disease with one other type of dementia. Such a bilateral comparison does not resemble clinical practice, where a clinician is faced with a number of different possible types of dementia. Here we studied which features in structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans could best distinguish four types of dementia, Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, vascular dementia, and dementia with Lewy bodies, and control subjects. We extracted an extensive set of features quantifying volumetric and morphometric characteristics from T1 images, and vascular characteristics from FLAIR images. Classification was performed using a multi-class classifier based on Disease State Index methodology. The classifier provided continuous probability indices for each disease to support clinical decision making. A dataset of 504 individuals was used for evaluation. The cross-validated classification accuracy was 70.6% and balanced accuracy was 69.1% for the five disease groups using only automatically determined MRI features. Vascular dementia patients could be detected with high sensitivity (96%) using features from FLAIR images. Controls (sensitivity 82%) and Alzheimer's disease patients (sensitivity 74%) could be accurately classified using T1-based features, whereas the most difficult group was the dementia with Lewy bodies (sensitivity 32%). These results were notable better than the classification accuracies obtained with visual MRI ratings (accuracy 44.6%, balanced accuracy 51.6%). Different quantification methods provided complementary information, and consequently, the best results were obtained by utilizing several quantification methods. The results prove that automatic quantification methods and computerized decision support methods are feasible for clinical practice and provide comprehensive information that may help clinicians in the diagnosis making."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Dementia is a general term to describe a syndrome involving loss of cognitive abilities. Most often dementia is caused by a progressive neurodegenerative disease. Dementia is a major health issue in our society both from the economic and human point of view.\nAlzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia that may account for 60-75% of dementia cases. Vascular dementia (VaD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) also occur frequently in elderly patients, while frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is relatively more common in dementia patients with early onset. Characteristic structural pathologies in these diseases include atrophy of the medial temporal lobe NeuroImage: Clinical 11 (2016) [435] [436] [437] [438] [439] [440] [441] [442] [443] [444] [445] [446] [447] [448] [449] in AD and atrophy of the frontal and temporal lobes in FTD. In DLB the brain structure is typically less affected. Absence of medial temporal lobe atrophy and findings of infarcts or white matter changes are typical to VaD. The atrophy patterns can be detected with T1-weighted images. Cortical and lacunar infarcts and white matter changes that are typical to VaD are identified on T1-weighted images and T2-weighted, dualecho Turbo Spin Echo (TSE) or Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) images.\nEarly and accurate differential diagnostics of neurodegenerative diseases is essential for two reasons. First, it has been shown that early diagnosis combined with current treatments can delay hospitalization (Feldman et al., 2009) , and the importance of the early diagnosis will dramatically increase as soon as disease-modifying drugs become available (Siemers et al., 2015) . Second, developing new treatments requires early and accurate identification of correct target populations. It has been hypothesized that too heterogeneous study populations may explain the failure of some previous pharmaceutical trials (Falahati et al., 2014) .\nThe studies on structural MRI that have characterized distinct neurodegenerative diseases are mostly based on visual ratings (Barber et al., 1999; Burton et al., 2009; Meyer et al., 2007; Varma et al., 2002) , volumetry (Meyer et al., 2007; Frisoni et al., 1999; Barber et al., 2000; Munoz-Ruiz et al., 2012; Ishii et al., 2007) , and local morphometry analyses (Munoz-Ruiz et al., 2012; Laakso et al., 2000; Burton et al., 2002; Barber et al., 2002; Ballmaier et al., 2004; Whitwell et al., 2007; Rabinovici et al., 2008; Kl\u00f6ppel et al., 2008) . Typical findings on the differences between different dementia types include: 1) the hippocampal volume and medial temporal lobe are relatively preserved in FTD as compared to AD (Duara et al., 1999; Frisoni et al., 1999) , 2) FTD-specific atrophy of the frontal and temporal lobes (Duara et al., 1999; Varma et al., 2002; Kl\u00f6ppel et al., 2008) , 3) relatively preserved brain anatomy in DLB as compared to AD and FTD (Meyer et al., 2007; Barber et al., 1999 Barber et al., , 2000 Burton et al., 2002 Burton et al., , 2009 Kantarci et al., 2012; Ishii et al., 2007; Whitwell et al., 2007) , and 4) extensive white matter changes with lacunar and cortical infarcts in VaD (Meyer et al., 2007) .\nThere are extensive literature comparing the dementia types with controls, but far less studies have been done on comparing the different dementia types with each other. In clinical practice, the actual question is to determine to which type of dementia a patient with cognitive complaints should be diagnosed. The guidelines for the early detection of neurodegenerative diseases (Rom\u00e1n et al., 1993; Neary et al., 1998; McKeith et al., 2005; Dubois et al., 2007; Waldemar et al., 2007; McKhann et al., 2011) are relatively general and do not provide specific and uniform information for accurate differential diagnostics of neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, the current diagnostic processes involve a certain degree of subjective assessment and require significant expertise from clinicians. Automatic image quantification methods and computerized decision support methods are able to objectively extract lots of information, more than the human eye can see, and evaluate how the patient data relates to typical data from different dementias. Such data are likely to be useful in clinical diagnosis making, especially supporting the decisions of unexperienced clinicians.\nThe objective of this paper is to perform an extensive study on differential diagnostics of dementias utilizing only structural MRI data. We evaluate several state of the art automatic quantification methods in order to find out which of the methods or what combination gives optimal classification accuracy. We utilize a dataset of 504 patients divided into five different groups: controls (CN), AD, FTD, DLB, and VaD. Both T1 and FLAIR data are used in the analysis."}, {"section_title": "Material and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Patient groups", "text": "We study a total of 504 patients from the Amsterdam Dementia Cohort who had visited the Alzheimer center of the VU University Medical Center between 2004 (van der Flier et al., 2014 .

Patients were diagnosed as having SCD when cognitive complaints could not be confirmed by cognitive testing and criteria for MCI, dementia or other neurological or psychiatric disorder known to cause cognitive complaints were not met. Patients were diagnosed with probable AD using the criteria of the National Institute for Neurological and Communicative Diseases Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association; all patients also met the core clinical criteria of the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association guidelines for AD (McKhann et al., 1984; McKhann et al., 2011) . FTD was diagnosed using the Neary criteria; patients also met the core criteria from Rasckovsky (Neary et al., 1998; Rascovsky et al., 2011) .

The study was approved by the local Medical Ethical Committee. All patients have signed written informed consent for their clinical data to be used for research purposes.\nThe normal cognition of all the SCD patients was confirmed at 9 months follow-up.

Detailed information on the imaging parameters for each disease group is available in Appendix A.\nImaging data were assessed visually for atrophy and vascular changes. Visual rating of medial temporal lobe atrophy was performed on coronal T1-weighted images according to the 5-point (0-4) rating scale for medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA) from the average score of the left and right sides (Scheltens et al., 1995) . Global cortical atrophy (GCA) was assessed visually on axial FLAIR images (possible range of scores 0-3) (Pasquier et al., 1996) .

In this method, the T1 image of a patient and the atlases are first registered using coarse non-rigid deformation. Then, an atlas selection is used to select 12 atlases out of the 60 atlases for more detailed non-rigid registration. A probabilistic atlas, generated from these atlas segmentations, is used as a prior in the intensity-based classification using the EM algorithm (L\u00f6tj\u00f6nen et al., 2010 ).

Here, registration parameters that result in a coarse match of the reference and patient images are used. Further details regarding the registration method used can be found in (L\u00f6tj\u00f6nen et al., 2010) . The GM segmentation of the patient is propagated to the reference space according to the calculated transformation. The GM segmentation is then smoothed using a Gaussian filter (\u03c3 = 4 mm) to produce a measure of GM concentration for each voxel. In order to generate a relatively small set of easily interpretable features for classification, the features are computed by combining the data within each of 139 regions of interest (ROIs). In addition, a global feature for the whole brain is computed by using the whole brain as a ROI. If the GM concentration is simply averaged ROI-wise, there can be inside a ROI both voxels where the GM concentration is higher in one disease group as compared to the other, and voxels where the GM concentration is lower. Consequently, the averaging would cancel these two opposite effects. Because of this, the GM concentration is computed separately for the voxels with typically higher or lower GM concentration, and then these values are summed up with different signs:\nwhere R defines the ROI, i and j define the two diseases studied, \nwhere P i; j \u00f0 p ! \u00de is the p-value of the t-test.

The p-and t-values are computed by applying the t-test on GM concentration data of a separate training set consisting of patients from the two disease groups i and j.\nConsequently, 139 ROI-wise and one global VBM features are obtained for each pair-wise comparison of diseases, i.e., in total 20 sets of VBM features for five groups. Note that F i , j VBM (R) = -F j , i VBM (R), so in practice only 10 sets of features need to be computed."}, {"section_title": "Tensor-based morphometry", "text": "An alternative approach to VBM is to characterize differences in brain morphometry using TBM. In TBM, the reference image is registered to the patient image using high-dimensional registration, and the analysis is done by comparing measures derived from the deformation fields (Ashburner et al., 1998) . In this study, the same registration method that is used in VBM is used in the TBM analysis, but the parameters are chosen to perform the registration at a finer level of detail. The local volume difference as compared to the reference is used to quantify the non-rigid deformation by computing the determinant of the Jacobian matrix:\nwhere\ngive the deformation from the reference to the patient image in x-, y-, and z-directions for voxel p ! .\nThe features are computed as in the VBM analysis. The only difference is that the GM concentration in Eq. (1) is replaced by the logarithm of the Jacobian log\u00f0J\u00f0 p ! \u00de\u00de. The logarithm is used to make the Jacobians more normally distributed and treat contraction and expansion in a similar fashion.

Manifold learning aims at finding a low-dimensional representation of high-dimensional data while trying to faithfully represent the intrinsic local geometry of the data. In (Guerrero et al., 2014; Wolz et al., 2011) manifold learning was used in the context of neurodegenerative disease population modeling to extract a meaningful low-dimensional representation better suited for classification.\nLaplacian eigenmaps (Belkin and Niyogi, 2002) can be used to derive a mapping from a high-dimensional space R D to a low-dimensional\nHere local geometry is determined by converting pairwise sum of squared differences (SSD) to a similarity matrix G using a Gaussian heat kernel. From G, the k-neighborhoods of data points are used to construct a sparse neighborhood matrix W. Laplacian eigenmaps seeks to place points x s and x r close together in R d if they are close in the original R D space (large similarity w s , r ). This is achieved by means of minimizing\nwhere y are the calculated manifold coordinates.

In this study two ROIs are utilized in manifold learning: one for hippocampus region and one for frontotemporal lobe region (Fig. 2) .

For example, the training data of this study contains more AD patients than FTD, DLB and VaD patients altogether leading to the situation that classifying all patients as AD produces already relatively good classification accuracy. The balanced accuracy is an estimate of the accuracy the classifier would achieve on a data set consisting of an equal amount of patients in each class.\nBecause the vascular changes are characteristics to VaD, and there are no VaD specific structural changes, only the vascular burden measure is included in the training set for the VaD patients.

The best individual quantification method is VBM.\nDetailed results for each combination of quantification methods and for each pair of diseases are presented in Appendix C. It is evident that a combination of more than one quantification method is needed to obtain good balanced accuracy. This is affected by the fact that no structural features are used for the VaD patients in the training set. Consequently, vascular burden measure is needed to produce high balanced accuracy values. The best balanced accuracy is obtained by combining five quantification methods. However, already the combination of ROI-based grading or VBM and vascular burden measure gives a balanced accuracy over 67% that is relatively close to the best result (69.2%).\nThe best individual features for each pair of diseases are given in Appendix D. The ROI-based grading features and the global VBM and TBM features were often among the best features. Individual ROIs from medial temporal lobe, frontal lobe, ventricles and cerebral white matter performed well in specific comparisons.\nAppendix A summarizes the classification results for different subgroups of imaging data. These results do not reveal major dependencies between classification results and imaging parameters when also the miss-balance of the disease groups is considered. Furthermore, these results indicate that our method is quite robust for heterogeneity in scanner type, resolution, and parameters used. We also tested the combination of visual MRI ratings and automatically determined features, but this did not improve the classification results obtained using only automatic image quantification methods. The accuracy was the same, but the balanced accuracy was slightly worse when visual ratings were included in the classification.\nThe confusion matrix of the classifications using all features is presented in Table 5 . The best sensitivity is obtained for VaD for which only one patient is classified as DLB. Also controls are classified accurately. Seventy four percent of the AD patients are correctly classified, and the misclassified patients are equally distributed among the other disease classes. The FTD patients are mostly misclassified as AD patients. The most difficult dementia to classify correctly is DLB, which is a predictable result as there are no clear DLB-specific structural changes. The miss-classified DLB patients are most often classified as AD patients.\nIn TBM and VBM, the features are computed utilizing the information on the locations where there are structural differences between the two disease groups studied. Figs. 4 and 5 show the maps of t-values for three disease-pair comparisons. Both TBM and VBM show large regions with structural differences between AD/FTD and controls. In TBM, the comparison of AD and FTD patients clearly shows increased atrophy in frontal and temporal lobes in FTD that can be used to differentiate these two diseases. Similarly, VBM shows decreased GM concentration in the frontal and temporal lobes for FTD. Fig. 6 shows examples of correctly classified patients. The control subject shows well-preserved brain anatomy, whereas the AD patient has enlarged ventricles and medial temporal lobe atrophy. The FTD patient has large atrophy in the frontal and temporal lobes and enlarged ventricles. The VaD patient has vast regions of WMH that can be seen as bright regions in FLAIR image but also as hypointense regions in T1 image. The VaD patient has also notable brain atrophy, but the vascular findings dominate the DSI computation, and therefore the patient is classified as VaD. Fig. 7 shows examples of the misclassified patients. The first case shows an AD patient that is classified as VaD because of the large WMH regions clearly visible in FLAIR image. The patients missclassified as AD have typical brain atrophy patterns to AD, and the AD patient classified as FTD patient has atrophy also in frontal lobe.\nThe DSI values for each class are also presented in Figs. 6 and 7. For the correctly classified patients in Fig. 6 , the difference between the DSI of the correct class and the second highest DSI is large, indicating that the patient can be diagnosed with high likelihood to the first class. It can be seen that even for the most obvious DLB patients the difference to the other classes is quite small, indicating that the diagnosis to DLB cannot be done with high confidence using only imaging data. These results demonstrate the usability of the continuous indices that describe the likelihood of each type of dementia and, therefore, provide information to support clinical decision making. For example, for 50.4% of the patients the difference of the two largest DSI values is more than 0.06. For this subset of patients the classification accuracy is 80.7%, i.e., much higher than for the whole dataset (70.6%)."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In this paper, we performed an extensive study on differential diagnostics of dementias using only structural MRI data. A five-class classification (CN, AD, FTD, VaD, and DLB groups) was done using 10-fold cross-validation with a dataset of 504 patients. Several image quantification methods (volumetry, VBM, TBM, manifold learning, ROI-based grading, and vascular burden) were used to produce features for classification. The features were normalized to take into account age-and gender-related variation, and also the effect of MRI field strength was normalized. In addition, there was notable imbalance in the size of the study groups, which means that relatively high accuracy could have been obtained just by assigning all patients to the group with most patients. Therefore, in addition to the classification accuracy, the balanced accuracy was computed to adjust the results for the imbalance in the size of the study groups in the dataset.\nA balanced classification accuracy of 69.1% was obtained when all the quantification methods were combined. In practice, it may not make sense to apply all quantification methods. The best combination of two quantification methods (ROI-based grading and vascular burden measure) gave already high balanced classification accuracy (67.7%) demonstrating that a well-chosen subset of quantification methods has the potential to differentiate accurately dementias. It is essential to include the vascular burden measure in the analysis, as it is needed to detect VaD patients. Otherwise, VBM, TBM, and/or ROI-based grading are reasonable choices to include in the analysis.\nVaD patients could be detected with high sensitivity of 96%. Also controls (sensitivity 82%) and AD patients (sensitivity 74%) could be accurately classified. FTD patients were most often misclassified as AD patients (21% of FTD patients) because of the similar pattern of medial temporal lobe atrophy. The most difficult type of dementia to differentiate was DLB with sensitivity of 32% as there are no DLB specific structural or vascular changes.\nThe five-class classification was performed also using visual MRI ratings as classification features. The results were considerably worse (acc = 44.6%, Bacc = 51.6%) than the results for automatically determined features (acc = 70.6%, Bacc = 69.1%), which proves that the automatic methods are able to quantify more detailed information that is essential for the differentiation of the dementias. Few studies have reported classification results for the differentiation of dementias (Barber et al., 1999; Varma et al., 2002; Kl\u00f6ppel et al., 2008; Ishii et al., 2007; Burton et al., 2009; Munoz-Ruiz et al., 2012) . However, the comparison of different studies is very difficult, as the studied groups and the number of patients vary. Also, most of the studies have utilized only two-class classifications, whereas in this study we performed differential diagnosis with five classes.\nThe strength of this study was that the classification method utilized here provides a continuous index for each disease describing the likelihood that the patient has the particular disease. If the highest index value is much larger than the second largest index value, it is probable that the class given by the classifier is correct. If two or more diseases have indices close to each other, the clinician cannot rely much on the results. On the other hand, as mixed pathologies are very common (33.8% of all dementia patients (Holmes et al., 1999) ), the indices might provide useful information for mixed diagnoses.\nNumerous state of the art classification methods are able to perform multi-class classification. However, most of them, such as support vector machines, work as a black box approach, where, for example, the significance of individual features cannot be easily inferred. The key driver of the DSI concept has been the simplicity, i.e., to keep the mathematics behind classification simple and easy to understand but still provide high classification accuracy. This objective was kept in mind also when transforming the technology from two-class classification problems to multi-class classification.\nAutomated quantification methods and computerized decision support methods provide additional objective information for clinicians to support their diagnosis. This extra information might be especially useful for unexperienced clinicians that do not constantly meet patients with different dementias in daily practice. This will equalize the treatment of patients regardless of in which hospital they are diagnosed.\nIn this study, the clinical assessment based on MRI data, neuropsychological test results, clinical information, and occasionally cerebrospinal fluid data was regarded as the gold standard, which was used in the evaluation of automated MRI methods. The gold standard diagnoses were made in a standardized way and according to clinical criteria in a multidisciplinary consensus meetings. In order to perform the classification study, we only considered the core diagnosis and ignored all remarks about mixed pathologies. However, the situation is not as straightforward in clinical practice but mixed diagnoses are common, and the diagnosis of the dementia can be surely confirmed only in autopsy (Lopez et al., 2002; Rabinovici et al., 2008) .\nThe imaging data used in this study was from a memory clinical cohort acquired during a period of about ten years. Consequently, image quality significantly varied. For example, data were acquired on 1.0 T, 1.5 T, and 3.0 T systems, while slice thickness of the FLAIR images varied between 1.0-6.5 mm. Using a more homogenous dataset could potentially improve results. However, the use of normal clinical imaging data shows that the proposed methods could be used in clinical practice where the data are often suboptimal.\nThe quantification methods could be further developed. Asymmetry features might provide information for the discrimination of FTD from other groups. Also, a more comprehensive set of ROIs in manifold learning and ROI-based grading could improve the classification accuracy. The quantification of vascular characteristics could be further improved by including T2-weighted MR images in the analysis (Wang et al., 2012) . In addition, functional imaging modalities, such as PET, SPECT, and fMRI, have proven to produce complementary information for the differential diagnostics of dementias (Jagust, 2006; Kantarci et al., 2012; Roman and Pascual, 2012; Varma et al., 2002; Duara et al., 1999) , and diffusion weighted MRI can be used to quantify white matter damage (Zhang et al., 2009 ). These imaging methods could provide valuable additional data to the methodology presented in this paper.\nAlthough in this paper we focused solely on imaging data, nonimaging data, such as the results of neuropsychological tests, CSF biomarkers and genetic data, are essential for the diagnostics of dementias, and no diagnosis should be done based on only imaging data. The objective of our further studies is to combine the methods studied in this paper with all the available non-imaging data in order to generate even more accurate classifier for the differential diagnostics of dementias.\nThis study was performed using imaging data from a single clinical center. In the future, our objective is to study how the methods presented can generalize for classifying patients from other clinical centers, and study if the data acquired from one center could be used to classify patients from another center."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "In this paper, the differential diagnostics of the four most common neurodegenerative diseases causing dementia, AD, FTD, VaD, and DLB, and patients with SCD, which were regarded as the control subjects, was studied with a large dataset and multiple quantification methods using T1-weighted and FLAIR MR images. The results show that these diseases can be differentiated with a high accuracy of 70.6% using only imaging data. Different quantification methods provide complementary information, and consequently, the best results are obtained by utilizing several quantification methods. The results show that automatic quantification methods and computerized decision support methods are feasible for clinical practice and provide comprehensive information that may help clinicians in the near future."}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgements", "text": "This work has received funding from the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration under grant agreements no. 611005 (PredictND) and no. 601055 (VPH-DARE@IT).

Imaging parameters in each disease group Tables A.6-A.9 show the distributions of the disease groups, and the classification and balance accuracies for different sub-sets of imaging data.\nIn total six MRI devices were used in this dataset (Table A. 6), and most of the patients were analyzed with a 3.0 T device (Table A.7). None of the AD patients was scanned with the 1.0 T MRI device, and almost half of the patients with 1.0 T MRIs were CNs. This explains the high classification accuracy for the 1.0 T device. On the other hand, GE Signa 1.5 T was used mostly for the dementia patients. Consequently, the accuracy for this device is lower than for other devices. In general, 3.0 T devices seem to produce slightly better results than 1.5 T devices.\nBecause of the miss-balance in the distribution of the disease groups between the MRI devices, especially the lack of AD patients scanned with the 1.0 T device, there is a possibility that the results are biased. However, the normalization of the features as described in Section 2.5 should reduce the risk for the bias. Also, the classification accuracies for the patients with 3.0 T images (Table A.7) are very similar to the results for the whole dataset, which proves that such bias has not affected the studies significantly.\nThe images were also divided into two groups based on image resolution. The images that have the largest voxel dimension smaller that 1.5 mm establish the high resolution group, whereas rest of the images are defined as low resolution images. Table A .8 presents the distributions of disease groups and classification accuracies for the T1 resolution groups. Similarly, Table A.9 shows the results for the FLAIR resolution groups. Most of the T1 images have high resolution. For the small group of low resolution images, the classification accuracies are notably lower than for the high resolution images. However, this may also be explained by the miss-balance of the disease groups. There is much more low resolution FLAIR images. However, the difference in classification results between the high and low resolution groups is not that large, which can be explained by the fact that the classifications are mostly done based on the features derived from T1 images."}, {"section_title": "Appendix B. Multi-class DSI classifier", "text": "The DSI classifier is based on the comparison of patient's feature values to the feature values of database patients with known diagnosis (Fig. B.8 ). Let us assume that the diagnosis needs to be done between two diseases, or disease states, called 'state 0' and 'state 1'. Now, the patient data are compared to the database patients belonging to either 'state 0' or 'state 1'. The comparison is done using the distributions of the feature values in both states, and it is evaluated to which distribution the patient feature better fits. If the feature value is on average smaller in the 'state 1', a fitness value is computed for each feature as\n1\u00de where x f is the value of the fth feature for the patient, R state1 (x f ) is the right integral of probability density function for 'state 1' and L state0 (x f ) is the left integral of probability density function for 'state 0'. If the patient feature value fits perfectly to the distribution of 'state 1' and does not fit at all to the distribution of 'state 0', the fitness value is one. On the other hand, a value of zero indicates a perfect fit with the 'state 0'. In addition, the importance of the features in differentiating the two disease states is computed using the database data. In practice, this is computed from the sensitivity and specificity of using the feature to classify the database patients:\nThis value, ranging from zero to one, is called the relevance.\nThe fitness values of all the features are combined using weighted averaging with the relevance values as the weights:\nThis combination gives a disease state index, a value between zero and one, that describes the likelihood of the patient belonging to the 'state 1' when the alternative diagnosis would be 'state 0'.\nIn multi-class classification, normal two-class classifications are performed between all the disease pairs. This gives a set of DSI values (in this study 20) that describe the likelihood of a patient having the disease i when the alternative diagnosis would be the disease j: DSI(i,j). From these pair-wise DSI values, the total DSI values for each disease is computed by averaging the DSI's of the disease pair analyses:\nwhere N c is the number of diseases groups. This value gives a likelihood index of patient having the disease i. When performing multi-class classification, the patient is assigned to the class with the highest DSI(i) value. "}]
