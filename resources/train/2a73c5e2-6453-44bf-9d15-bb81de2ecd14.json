The Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, which performed serial measurements of height over 9 years in a cohort of men and women, documented that height loss begins at approximately age 30 and increases with age. 1 On average, in women, height decreased 5 cm between ages 30 and 70 years, and by age 80, women had lost 8 cm of height. 1 Age-related height loss is believed to be a result of decreasing height of intervertebral discs and joint cartilage, scoliosis, less pronounced foot arches, and postural changes 2 as well as osteoporotic vertebral fractures and weakness of the back muscles. [3] [4] [5] [6] Clinical trials have not examined longitudinal associations between calcium and vitamin D (CaD) supplementation plus change in height among US postmenopausal women. It is possible that CaD supplementation reduces height loss, particularly if it decreases vertebral fracture risk. Whether CaD supplementation reduces vertebral fracture risk is, however, controversial, with heterogeneity among clinical trial results. 7, 8 It is also possible that CaD supplementation may decrease height loss by decreasing morphometric vertebral fractures, slowing bone mineral density loss, and/or by decreasing the frequency of falls. 9 The goal of the current study was to determine the associations between CaD (vs placebo) and height loss in participants enrolled in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) Calcium and Vitamin D trial. We prospectively measured participant height using a standard protocol and collected detailed data regarding osteoporosis risk factors in more than 36,000 postmenopausal women."}, {"section_title": "METHODS Participants", "text": "The WHI CaD trial enrolled 36,282 postmenopausal women 50 to 79 years of age who were already participating in a WHI clinical trial (the WHI Dietary Modification trial and/or the WHI Hormone Therapy trial) at 40 US clinical centers ( Fig. 1 ). Participants were randomly assigned in a double-blind fashion to receive 1,000 mg of elemental calcium as calcium carbonate with 400 IU of vitamin D 3 daily or placebo. Women were permitted to take their own calcium supplements up to 1,000 mg per day and their own vitamin D 3 supplements up to 1,000 IU per day. Eligibility criteria and recruitment methods were described in detail previously. 10, 11 Participants were followed until death, loss to follow-up, or study closeout (March 31, 2005) ( Fig. 1 ).\nBetween calendar years 1995 and 2000, 36,282 participants were enrolled in the WHI CaD trial. For the current study, we analyzed baseline (at the time of randomization into the CaD trial) and follow-up data from all participants of the CaD trial who underwent height measurement at one or more time points. We excluded data from eight participants (five in the active therapy group, three in the placebo group) for whom information on measured height was not available at any time point (baseline or subsequent follow-up).\nThe institutional review boards of each participating institution approved the trial protocol and each participant provided written informed consent at the CaD trial randomization visit.

Mean heights were assumed to be equal between treatment groups at randomization, so the model included a common intercept, along with variables for time (years since randomization; linear), time \u00c2 randomization group interaction, age at randomization as a covariate, along with a random intercept and random slope for time. To confirm that the LME model was reasonable, estimates for mean height (95% CI) were also computed from a classical repeated measures model with an unstructured variance-covariance matrix that did not assume a linear relationship with time; annual visits were coded categorically. In the aforementioned analyses, follow-up was restricted to 8 years after CaD trial randomization. (Only 3% of participants underwent a ninth visit).\nThe incidence of clinical height loss, defined as at least 1.5 inches changes from time of randomization, was investigated with a Cox proportional hazards model that was stratified on age group and randomization into the dietary trial and hormone therapy trials. (Clinical guidelines state that historical height loss of 1.5 inches [3.8 cm] among postmenopausal women age 50 and older constitutes the need for further evaluation for vertebral fractures. 15 ) The Grambsch and Therneau test did not suggest any evidence against the proportionality assumption (P \u00bc 0.65).\nSubgroup analyses, designated a priori, were performed to investigate whether the effect of CaD on height loss was modified by age (5-y age groups), race/ethnicity (white, black, Hispanic, other), total calcium intake (<1,200, !1,200 mg/d), total vitamin D intake (<600, !600 IU/d for women 70 y; <800, !800 IU/d for women >70 y), use of calcium supplements at baseline, use of vitamin D supplements at baseline, use of menopausal hormone therapy (randomization into the active arm of the WHI Hormone Therapy trials or self-initiation of menopausal hormone therapy), and physical activity level (MET-h/wk above vs below median). The cutpoints for total calcium and total vitamin D were based on Institute of Medicine recommendations. 16 Statistical significance was based on a test of interaction, and no adjustment for multiple testing was made; at most one interaction was expected to be significant by chance alone.\nWe also examined a range of height loss thresholds (0.5-3.0 inches) as individual outcomes of Cox regression models. 6 Secondary analyses were conducted to test whether results differed in analyses limited to data from women who were adherent to study pills. Follow-up was censored when participants took less than 80% of study pills according to weight of returned pill bottles during clinic visits. 11, 17 To maintain balance of participant characteristics and produce a fair comparison between randomization groups, regression models included the inverse of a participant's estimated adherence probability as a weighting factor. Weights were time-dependent and estimated from a Cox model that allowed the baseline hazard to vary by randomization group and age group, and included race/ethnicity, marital status, smoking status, calcium supplement use at year 1, vitamin D supplement use at year 1, WHI Dietary Modification trial randomization group and WHI Hormone Therapy trial randomization group as predictor variables, which have previous been found to be significantly associated with CaD adherence. 18 Interactions between CaD randomization group and predictor variables were initially included in our Cox model, but later dropped, and not used to estimate weights, because they were not significant predictors of adherence.

For example, at randomization the observed skewness and kurtosis of height were near zero: \u00c00.002 and 0.4, respectively. Mean height loss was similar between randomization groups during the trial. Participants assigned to the CaD group lost an average height of 1.28 mm per year versus 1.26 mm per year in the placebo group (P \u00bc 0.35; Figs. 2 and 3 ).

When we varied the definition of substantial height loss over the range of thresholds (0.5-3.0 inches [1.25-7.5 cm]), associations between CaD trial randomization group and substantial height loss were not statistically significant (Table 4 ).

Similarly, accounting for adherence changed the hazard ratio (95% CI) for clinical height loss from 1.00 (0.81, 1.23) to 1.05 (0.75, 1.48), and the P value changed from 0.99 to 0.72."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "In this cohort of generally healthy postmenopausal women, CaD supplementation versus placebo did not decrease height loss over an average follow-up of 5.9 years. There was no evidence that the associations between treatment group and height loss varied by age, race/ethnicity, total calcium intake, or total vitamin D intake. In the sensitivity analysis accounting for adherence to study pills, the results were similar to those of the main analysis, with no evidence of an effect of randomization to CaD in decreasing height loss.\nTo our knowledge, previously published results of clinical trials have not specifically focused on longitudinal associations between CaD supplementation and change in height among US postmenopausal women.\nWe believe that our findings reflect the multifactorial nature of age-related height loss. In addition to osteoporotic vertebral fractures, 19 weakness of the back muscles, [3] [4] [5] [6] decreasing height of intervertebral discs and joint cartilage, CRANDALL ET AL less pronounced foot arches, and postural changes 2 are believed to contribute to height loss. All types of vertebral deformity may be associated with height loss. 20 The multiple causative factors, not all of which would be amenable to an influence of CaD supplementation, may have obscured our ability to detect protective effects of calcium with vitamin D on height loss, if such effect exists. We also note that although height loss has been associated with adverse health consequences in longitudinal studies, including increased risk of falls, decreased grip strength, decreased walking speed, increased fracture incidence, and increased risk of death, 19, [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] it is not clear that interventions to prevent height loss can prevent those adverse health outcomes.\nThe use of CaD supplements is widespread. In the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005-2006 of the US population, among women aged between 51 and 70 years, 40% reported using vitamin D supplements and 67% reported using calcium supplements. 33 A protective effect of CaD supplementation against height loss would potentially impact large numbers of postmenopausal women. Our results, however, do not support this strategy. Previous studies from the WHI CaD trial data did not find evidence of protective effects of CaD supplementation against decline in physical functioning, 34 hip fracture risk, 11 vertebral fracture risk, 11 or risk of death, 35, 36 although there was a lower hip fracture risk among women aged 60 years and older who were assigned to CaD versus placebo. 11 CaD, calcium and vitamin D; HT, hormone therapy; MET, metabolic equivalent of task. a From a linear mixed effects model that included a common intercept, along with variables for time (years since randomization; linear), time \u00c2 randomization group interaction, age at randomization as a covariate, along with a random intercept and random slope for time.

Height measurements that occurred after the Women's Health Initiative Hormone Therapy trials were stopped have been censored and follow-up is through year 6 after CaD trial randomization. In both treatment groups, we observed strong associations between age and height loss, with older women experiencing the largest magnitudes of annual decrease in height. Compared with the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, height loss by age group was less rapid in the current study. 1 For example, among the 71 women aged 60 to 69 years, and the 78 women aged 70-79 years in the BLAS study, mean height loss was 0.223 and 0.290 cm/y, respectively. In contrast, height loss was 0.223 cm/y among more than 2,600 WHI participants age 75 years or older. One reason may be that the data collection in the previous study occurred from 1978 to 1993 with an average of five height measurements over 9 years of follow-up, whereas our data collection occurred from 1995 to 2005, and may reflect changes in lifestyle and nutrition.\nOur study has potential limitations. First, it is possible that results would have shown CaD supplementation to be protective against height loss if the trial participants had been selected on the basis of having low calcium or vitamin D intake. Participants were allowed to take multivitamins as well as calcium and vitamin D up to 1,000 mg/d of Refers to use of calcium supplements at baseline. f Baseline intake from dietary and supplement sources.

In the current study, average total baseline intake from dietary sources and supplements was 1,150 mg/d for calcium and 365 IU/d for vitamin D. Although participants were permitted to use bisphosphonates selective estrogen-receptor modulators, the prevalence of use of these medications was low at baseline (<2%). Participants of the WHI Dietary Modification trial were permitted to take selective estrogen-receptor modulators and menopausal hormone therapy. Second, participants were healthy postmenopausal women living in the community and predominantly free of disability. Results cannot be generalized to elderly women who are institutionalized. Third, WHI did not assess morphometric vertebral fractures (which would have required serial vertebral x-rays in all participants). It remains possible that CaD supplementation may decrease morphometric vertebral fractures, although we found no association between CaD and clinical vertebral fractures. Despite the large sample size of this study, overall mean height loss was low and few women experienced clinical height loss. Finally, although we used a wall-mounted stadiometer with a standardized protocol for height measurements, height was measured only once for each participant, so there may have been some measurement error. This type of error would, however, bias the findings toward the null, and the large sample size suggests that the overall effect of such an error would be small. Our findings should not be interpreted as discouraging adherence to guideline recommendations regarding CaD supplementation. The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends vitamin D supplementation to prevent falls among community-dwelling adults aged 65 years or older who are at increased risk for falls. 37 Strengths of this study include the placebo comparison group, the availability of detailed information regarding important covariates, a large number of participants, and longitudinal standardized objective height measurements. The latter have advantages over self-reported height loss, which can be over-reported. 38 "}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "In conclusion, the use of CaD supplements is widespread, but the CaD preparation and doses that were tested in this large clinical trial did not prevent height loss."}]
