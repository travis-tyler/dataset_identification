The leading 100 academic S&E recipients in FY 1993 (out of 1,091 institutions, excluding 35 system offices) accounted for 81 percent of the total. The Johns Hopkins University (including its Applied Physics Laboratory, which received over three-fifths of the Johns Hopkins University's total) was the top recipient of Federal academic S&E support, nearly all of it from DOD and HHS. Eighteen of the top twenty academic S&E recipients in FY 1993 were also among the leading 20 in FY 1992. The new entrants were Duke University (now 19th) and the University of Texas at Austin (20th). general. Five Federal agencies accounted for almost 90 percent of the R&D obligated to HBCUs, with no agency accounting for more than percent of the R&D total.

Over three-fifths of all nonprofit support was to research institutes, even though they accounted for less than one-fourth of all recipient nonprofit institutions (which also include voluntary hospitals and other independent organizations such as private foundations and trade associations).

DOD was the source of all support for Sematech, Inc., and nearly all of the Mitre Corp.'s funding. Of the Federal total, DOD provided about one-fourth of all obligations to nonprofit institutions, with nearly $7 of each $8 from DOD going to research institutes.

Demonstration projects conducted to discover whether a technology or method is workable are considered to be within the scope of R&D if their objective is to produce new information within a specific time period. \"Research\" is defined as systematic study directed toward fuller scientific knowledge or understanding of the subject studied. Research can be classified as basic or applied, although data reported here are not separated into these categories. In basic research the investigation is oriented toward gaining a better knowledge or understanding of the fundamental aspects of phenomena and of observable facts without specific applications toward processes or products in mind. In applied research the investigation is aimed at gaining the knowledge or understanding necessary for determining the means by which a recognized and specific need may be met. \"Development\" is the systematic use of knowledge and understanding gained from research directed toward the production of useful materials, devices, systems, or methods, including design and development of prototypes and processes. Research and development excludes topographic mapping and surveys, collection of general-purpose statistics, and activities concerned primarily with the dissemination of scientific information. Also excluded are routine product testing, quality control, and R&D facilities and fixed equipment. \"Research equipment\" is included as part of R&D. It includes any item (or interrelated collection of items constituting a system) of nonexpendable tangible property or software having a useful life of more than 2 years and an acquisition cost of $500 or more that is used wholly or in part for research. R&D plant includes all costsdirect. indirect, and relatedof all projects whose main objective is to provide support for the construction, acquisition, renovation, modification, repair, or rental of facilities, land, works, or equipment for use in scientific or engineering R&D. A facility is interpreted broadly to be any physical resource important to the conduct of R&D. Excluded are expendable research equipment and office furniture and equipment. Facilities and equipment for S&E instruction include all programs in which the main purpose is to provide support for the construction, acquisition, renovation, modification, repair, or rental of facilities, land, works, or equipment for use in instruction in science and engineering. Fellowships, traineeships, and training grants include graduate programs in support of the development and maintenance of S&E personnel resources. The total amounts pertaining to such awards (stipends and cost-of-education allowances) are reported on the basis of the institution chosen by the recipient. Excluded are programs that support research and education institutes, seminars, and conferences such as teacher-training activities provided through teacher institutes, short courses, research participation, and in-service seminars; activities aimed at the development of education techniques and materials for use in S&E training; and programs that provide special opportunities for increasing the scientific knowledge and experience of precollege and undergraduate students.

Such projects are generally oriented toward academic departments, institutes, or institutions as a whole and embody varying types of supportranging from that provided without any specification of purpose other than that the funds be used for scientific projects to that provided for activities within a specified field of science and engineering without a specific purpose. NIH's Biomedical Research Support Grants and Minority Biomedical Support Grants are examples of these typcs of programs.

The treatment of interagency transfers explains much of the difference in the totals. Interagency transfers of funds obligated to an academic or nonprofit institution are reported in the Federal Support Survey by the agency that actually obligates the funds to the receiving institution. In the Federal Funds Survey, however, obligations are reported by the initiating agency. Each of several agencies utilizes personnel from separate internal offices to respond to the two individual surveys, and each frequently.collects data from different sources. Data for the Federal Support Survey, for example, are generally processed from award files, whereas Federal Funds Survey data are usually derived from agency budget documents. Respondents from the separate internal offices that participate in the two surveys also frequently differ in their interpretation of the survey questions. The National Institutes of Health, for example, reports its Biomedical Research Support Grants under \"General support for science & engineering\" in the Federal Support Survey but under \"Research and development\" in the Federal Funds Survey. Regarding the structure of the surveys themselves, the data presented in this report differ in sevei al ways from those presented in the report on the Federal Funds Survey: The two surveys differ in number of agencies involved. In the Federal Support Survey, the I 5 Federal agenries that obligate virtually all of Federal support to academic R&D collect data on all Federal S&E obligations to institutions of higher education. For the Federal Funds Survey, data are gathered on budgets for R&D and R&D plant from all 32 Federal agencies that conduct such programs. 2. The scope of information gathered differs between the two surveys: Data collected in the Federal Support Survey pertain to individual academic institutions, whereas 15 those collected ir. the Federal Funds Survey relate to all types of performers and to character of work (basic research, applied research, and development).
