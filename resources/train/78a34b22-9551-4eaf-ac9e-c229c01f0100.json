Hippocampal volumes are generally smaller in AD patients carrying the e4 allele compared to e4 noncarriers. Here we examined the effect of APOE e4 on hippocampal morphometry in a large imaging database-the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We automatically segmented and constructed hippocampal surfaces from the baseline MR images of 725 subjects with known APOE genotype information including 167 with AD, 354 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 204 normal controls. High-order correspondences between hippocampal surfaces were enforced across subjects with a novel inverse consistent surface fluid registration method. Multivariate statistics consisting of multivariate tensor-based morphometry (mTBM) and radial distance were computed for surface deformation analysis. Using Hotelling's T 2 test, we found significant morphological deformation in APOE e4 carriers relative to noncarriers in the entire cohort as well as in the nondemented (pooled MCI and control) subjects, affecting the left hippocampus more than the right, and this effect was more pronounced in e4 homozygotes than heterozygotes. Our findings are consistent with previous studies that showed e4 carriers exhibit accelerated hippocampal atrophy; we extend these findings to a novel measure of hippocampal morphometry. Hippocampal morphometry has significant potential as an imaging biomarker of early stage AD.

Current therapeutic failures in patients with symptomatic memory loss may reflect intervention that is too late, or else targets that represent secondary effects less relevant to disease initiation and early progression (Hyman, 2011) . For therapy to be successful, timing may be critical.\nIn presymptomatic subjects, determining whether AD is present is challenging. The apolipoprotein E (APOE) e4 allele is the most prevalent risk factor for AD (Corder et al., 1993; Saunders et al., 1993) , and is present in roughly 20-25% of North Americans and Europeans (Gerdes et al., 1992) . This discovery has made it possible to study large numbers of genetically at-risk individuals before the onset of symptomatic memory impairment and has led to the concept of preclinical stage AD (Sperling et al., 2011) , a concept validated in autopsy studies of nondemented elderly subjects with neuropathological evidence of AD at autopsy (Bennett et al., 2009; Caselli et al., 2010; Dickson et al., 1992; Gouras et al., 1997; Kok et al., 2009) , magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of infants at differential genetic risk (Dean et al., 2013; Knickmeyer et al., 2013) , fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) studies of APOE e4 carriers that have revealed AD-like patterns of reduced CMRglucose (Reiman et al., 1996 (Reiman et al., , 2005 , amyloid ligand binding studies using Pittsburgh Imaging Compound B that show evidence of cerebral amyloidosis in APOE e4 carriers , cerebrospinal fluid levels of beta amyloid that begin to fall, suggesting the onset of AD, in the early 50s in e4 carriers (Morris et al., 2010) , and neuropsychological studies showing the accelerated decline of memory scores in a gene-dose pattern in APOE e4 carriers beginning between age 55 and 60 ) that is further accelerated in APOE e4 homozygotes by cerebrovascular risk factors (Caselli et al., 2011) .\nSo far we lack a widely available, highly objective brain imaging biomarker that can identify abnormal degrees of r Shi et al. r r 3904 r cerebral atrophy and accelerated rate of atrophy in preclinical individuals at high risk of AD for whom early intervention is needed. A biologically grounded approach is vital to identify reliable biomarkers, consolidate all information, reduce the sheer number of statistical tests, and improve statistical power. In AD research, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based measures include whole-brain (Chen et al., 2007; Fox et al., 1999; Stonnington et al., 2010) , entorhinal cortex (Cardenas et al., 2011) , hippocampus (den Heijer et al., 2010; Jack et al., 2003; Reiman et al., 1998; Thompson et al., ; Wolz et al., 2010) , and temporal lobe volumes , as well as ventricular enlargement (Jack et al., 2003; Thompson et al., ; Wang et al., 2011) . These correlate closely with differences and changes in cognitive performance, supporting their validity as markers of disease progression. Although many current studies examine cortical and substructural volumes (den Heijer et al., 2010; Dewey et al., 2010; Holland et al., 2009; Jack et al., 2003 Jack et al., , 2004 Ridha et al., 2008; Vemuri et al., 2008a Vemuri et al., , 2008b Wolz et al., 2010) , recent research (Apostolova et al., 2010b (Apostolova et al., , 2010c Chou et al., 2009; Costafreda et al., 2011; Ferrarini et al., 2008; Madsen et al., 2010; Morra et al., 2009b; Qiu et al., 2010; Styner et al., 2005; Thompson et al., ) has demonstrated that surface-based subregional structure analysis offers advantages over volume measures, in some respects. For precise analysis of MRI patterns of hippocampal deformation for preclinical AD research, a subregional analysis would be beneficial.\nRecently, we introduced surface multivariate tensorbased morphometry (mTBM) system (Shi et al., 2013a (Shi et al., , 2013b Wang et al., 2010 Wang et al., , 2011 Wang et al., , 2012 and applied it to study AD effects on hippocampal morphometry (Shi et al., 2013a; Wang et al., 2011) . Based on our experience assessing APOE e4 effects in preclinical populations (Caselli et al., , 2010 (Caselli et al., , 2011 Reiman et al., 1996 Reiman et al., , 2001 Reiman et al., , 2009 Stein et al., 2012) and the relatively large sample size in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI; Jack et al., 2008; Miller, 2009; Mueller et al., 2005a Mueller et al., , 2005b dataset, we applied a novel hippocampal morphometry method to a large cohort of MR images of individuals with known genotype. Subregional variations in hippocampal surfaces in 725 subjects (167 AD, 354 MCI, and 204 controls) were examined for relationships with APOE e4 dose information, from APOE e4 noncarriers, people heterozygous and homozygous for APOE e4 allele. We hypothesized that the degree of hippocampal deformation would relate to genetic risk groups for AD, including adults who carry one or two copies of the APOE e4 allele, a major AD susceptibility gene."}, {"section_title": "SUBJECTS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu). The ADNI was launched in 2003 by the National Institute on Aging (NIA), the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), private pharmaceutical companies and non-profit organizations, as a $60 million, 5-year publicprivate partnership. The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial magneticresonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early Alzheimer's disease (AD). Determination of sensitive and specific markers of very early AD progression is intended to aid researchers and clinicians to develop new treatments and monitor their effectiveness, as well as lessen the time and cost of clinical trials.\nThe Principal Investigator of this initiative is Michael W. Weiner, MD, VA Medical Center and University of California -San Francisco. ADNI is the result of efforts of many coinvestigators from a broad range of academic institutions and private corporations, and subjects have been recruited from over 50 sites across the U.S. and Canada. The initial goal of ADNI was to recruit 800 subjects but ADNI has been followed by ADNI-GO and ADNI-2. To date these three protocols have recruited over 1500 adults, ages 55 to 90, to participate in the research, consisting of cognitively normal older individuals, people with early or late MCI, and people with early AD. The follow up duration of each group is specified in the protocols for ADNI-1, ADNI-2 and ADNI-GO. Subjects originally recruited for ADNI-1 and ADNI-GO had the option to be followed in ADNI-2. For up-to-date information, see www.adni-info.org.\nAt the time of downloading (September 2010), among the 843 subjects in the baseline dataset, 738 subjects were genotyped and classified as APOE e4 carriers or noncarriers. All subjects underwent thorough clinical and cognitive assessment at the time of acquisition, including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score (Folstein et al., 1975) , Clinical Dementia Rating (Berg, 1988) , and Delayed Logical Memory Test (Wechsler, 1987) .\nIn this study, all T1-weighted images from ADNI baseline dataset were automatically segmented using FIRST software 1 to segment the hippocampus substructure. We reconstructed hippocampal surfaces based on binary segmentations (Shi et al., 2013a) . As a quality control, we manually checked all the constructed meshes and excluded five AD, five MCI, and three healthy control subjects with wrong surface topologies (Shi et al., 2013a) . As a result, a total of 725 ADNI baseline subjects with APOE information, including 167 AD (age: 75.5 6 7.6 years), 354 MCI (age: 75.1 6 7.2 years), and 204 controls (age: 76.2 6 4.9 years) were studied using the new system for this article. Table I gives detailed demographic data information on the subjects.\nIn our study, following prior work (Morra et al., 2009a (Morra et al., , 2009b Shi et al., 2013a) , we pooled both the subjects who are heterozygous APOE e4 carriers (e3/e4) and homozygous APOE e4 carriers (e4/e4) together to form the APOE e4 carriers group and correlated presence of the APOE e4 allele with hippocampal morphometry, both (1) in the entire sample and (2) in nondemented (pooled MCI and controls) subjects. Throughout the article, we call these two populations as the full ADNI cohort and nondemented cohort, respectively. Figure 1 shows our overall sequence of processing. First, given the three-dimensional (3D) MRI scans from the ADNI baseline dataset, hippocampal substructures were segmented with FIRST (Patenaude et al., 2011) and hippocampal surfaces were automatically reconstructed based on the segmentations (Han et al., 2003) . Second, a conformal grid was generated for each surface with the holomorphic 1-form based surface conformal parameterization (Wang et al., 2011) . With this conformal grid, we computed the conformal representation of the surface (Gu and Vemuri, 2004) , i.e., the conformal factor and mean curvature, which represent the intrinsic and extrinsic features of the surface, respectively. The \"feature image\" of a surface was computed by combining the conformal factor and mean curvature and linearly scaling the dynamic range into [0, 255] . Third, we registered the feature image of each surface in the dataset to a common template with an inverse consistent fluid registration algorithm (Shi et al., 2013a) . With conformal parameterization, we essentially converted a 3D surface registration problem into a 2D image registration problem. The flow induced in the parameter domain establishes highorder correspondences between 3D surfaces. Finally, we studied the differences between different diagnostic groups with the mTBM statistics (Lepor e et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2010) , which retain the full tensor information of the deformation Jacobian matrix, together with the radial distance, which retains information on the deformation along the surface normal direction."}, {"section_title": "Processing Pipeline", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Hippocampus Segmentation and Surface Reconstruction", "text": "All T1-weighted MR images were automatically segmented using FIRST (Patenaude et al., 2011) . FIRST is a model-based subcortical structure segmentation and registration tool developed as part of the FSL library, which is written mainly by members of the Analysis Group, FMRIB, Oxford, UK. We ran the run_first_all routine with default parameters tuned by FIRST as optimal for hippocampal segmentation. Among the results of the routine, we took the three-phase image which contains the labels of the left and right hippocampi as shown in Figure 1a . Then the binary image for each side was obtained by a simple thresholding process. Hippocampal surfaces were constructed with a topology-preserving level set method based on the binary segmentations (Han et al., 2003) and triangular surface meshes were obtained based on the marching cubes algorithm (Lorensen and Cline, 1987) . After mesh refinement (Shi et al., 2013a) , we obtained smooth surfaces that are suitable for generating conformal grids as shown in Figure 1b . Finally each of the smoothed meshes was aligned into the MNI standard space using a global affine transformation with a nine-parameter (three parameters for translation, three parameters for rotation, and three parameters for scaling) matrix that was computed by FIRST (Patenaude et al., 2011) .

To generate a planar surface conformal parameterization for a closed hippocampal surface, we applied an automatic algorithm, topological A chart showing the key steps in our system. MR images were automatically segmented by FIRST to extract the hippocampal substructure (a). After the hippocampal surfaces were constructed from FIRST segmentations (b), we computed their conformal parameterizations with holomorphic 1-forms (c and d). Then feature images were generated by combining the local conformal factor and mean curvature that were computed from the conformal parameterizations. After the inverse consistent fluid registration was done in the feature image domain, we deformed the surfaces using the obtained displacements (e). The new statistics consisting of radial distance and multivariate TBM were computed at each point on the resultant matching surface (f). Then the Hotelling T 2 test was applied to study genetic influence of APOE e4 allele (g).

The locations of the two cuts are at the front and back of the hippocampal surface, representing its anterior junction with the amygdala, and its posterior limit as it turns into the white matter of the fornix. They are biologically valid and consistent landmarks across subjects. Given the hippocampal tube-like shape, these landmark curves are automatically determined by checking the extreme points when searching along the first principle direction of geometric moments of surface (Elad et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2011; Zhang and Lu, 2004 ). For quality control purposes, we have manually checked the consistency of all landmark curves. Then the exact 1-form basis was computed with the open boundary surface . Later we computed the basis for all closed but nonexact 1-forms. The harmonic 1-form basis is the union of the exact 1-form basis and the closed but nonexact 1-form basis. By solving a linear system with the harmonic 1-form basis, we obtained the conjugate of the exact 1-form basis. The exact 1-form basis and its conjugate 1-form form the holomorphic 1-form basis, which induces a conformal grid on the hippocampal surface. Figure 1c,d shows two example hippocampal surfaces with their conformal grids. In both pictures, the overlaid checkerboard texture is used to demonstrate the angle preserving property, i.e., the right angles on the planar checkerboard texture are well preserved after they are overlaid on hippocampal surfaces.\nThe conformal parameterization of a surface contains a number of geometric features about the surface. In our system, we computed the local conformal factor and mean curvature, which uniquely determine a closed surface in 3D, up to a rigid motion . Conformal factor is the area ratio of an infinitesimal region around a point on the surface and an infinitesimal region around the same point on the planar parameter domain. It represents the intrinsic features of a surface. By contrast, the mean curvature represents the extrinsic features of a surface. Both measurements, the conformal factor and mean curvature, are local features which are defined on each surface vertex. Since the conformal factor and mean curvature encode both intrinsic structure and 3D embedding information, we call them the surface conformal representation. In our framework, conformal representation is adopted as surface features for automated surface registration. As shown in Figure 1e , we summed up the conformal factor and mean curvature and linearly scaled the dynamic range of the summation into [0, 255] to form the feature image of the surface."}, {"section_title": "Hippocampal Surface Registrations", "text": "Similar to other tensor-based morphometry (TBM) work (e.g., Chung, 2012; Davatzikos et al., 1996; Hua et al., 2011) , we need to register each individual hippocampal surface to a common template surface for morphometric analysis. With the conformal parameterization and conformal representation, we convert the 3D surface registration problem into a 2D image registration problem. The wellstudied image fluid registration algorithm (Bro-Nielsen and Gramkow, 1996; D'Agostino et al., 2003) can be easily applied to induce a deformation flow in the parameter domain, which in turn enforces a high-order correspondence in 3D. We introduced a correction term in the traditional Navier-Stokes equation to compensate for the parameterization area distortion. With conformal parameterization, the correction term was simply the conformal factor and the surface fluid registration can be easily developed by extending the Navier-Stokes equation to drive flows on general surfaces, regardless of the underlying parameterizations. We call this method surface fluid registration (Shi et al., 2013a) .\nFurthermore, most image registration algorithms in the literature are not symmetric, i.e., the correspondences established between the two images depend on which image is assigned as the deforming image and which is the nondeforming target image. An asymmetric algorithm can be problematic as they tend to penalize the expansion of image regions more than shrinkage (Rey et al., 2002) . Thus, in our system, we further extended the surface fluid registration method into an inverse consistent framework (Leow et al., 2005) . The obtained surface registration is diffeomorphic. An example is as shown in Figure 1e . For details of our inverse consistent surface fluid registration method, we refer to (Shi et al., 2013a) ."}, {"section_title": "Surface Multivariate Morphometry Statistics", "text": "Our multivariate morphometry statistical analysis consists of mTBM (Lepor e et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2009 ) and radial distance analysis (Pizer et al., 1999; Thompson et al.,) . This combines complementary information from mTBM, which measures deformation within surfaces, and radial distance, which measures hippocampal size in terms of the surface normal direction.\nThe mTBM statistics have been carefully studied in brain structure morphology analyses and they can demonstrate improved signal detection power relative to more standard Jacobian matrix statistics (Shi et al., 2013a (Shi et al., , 2013b Wang et al., 2011 Wang et al., , 2012 Wang et al., , 2013 . As mTBM retains the full information in the deformation tensor fields, it is very sensitive to deformations such as rotation, dilation, and shear along the surface tangent direction, which is perpendicular to the surface normal. Given the hippocampal tube-like shape, its atrophy and enlargement directly affect the distance from each surface point to its medial core (analogous to the center line in a tube). We call this distance the radial distance of a hippocampal surface. Radial distance mainly describes morphometric changes along the surface normal direction and has been applied in many subcortical studies (Bansal et al., 2000; Gerig et al., 2001; Morra et al., 2009b; Pizer et al., 1999; Thompson et al., ) . Thus, these two statistics are complementary to each other. In this article, we adopted the multivariate statistics proposed in (Wang et al., 2011) \nshape differences between groups with different diagnosis, APOE e4 dose, and healthy controls.\nAs in our prior work (Wang et al., 2011) , the mTBM was computed as a 3 3 1 vector consisting of the \"LogEuclidean metric\" (Arsigny et al., 2006) , computed as the matrix logarithm of the deformation tensor. Given a hippocampal surface with the conformal parameterization as described in Conformal Grid Generation section, the radial distance was computed as the distance from each parametric surface point to the center of 3D positions of the iso-u curves in the parameter domain (Wang et al., 2011) , as shown by the red curves in Figure 1f . We formed the new multivariate surface morphometry statistic as a 4 3 1 vector consisting of the mTBM and radial distance."}, {"section_title": "Statistical Group Difference", "text": "To assess group differences with multivariate statistics, we applied Hotelling's T 2 test (Cao and Worsley, 1999; Hotelling, 1931; Kim et al., 2012; Thirion et al., 2000) on sets of values in the log-Euclidean space of the deformation tensors.

We also used a predefined statistical threshold of P 5 0.05 at each surface point to estimate the overall significance of the group difference maps by nonparametric permutation testing Nichols and Holmes, 2002) . In each case, the covariate (group membership) was permuted 10,000 times and a null distribution was developed for the area of the average surface with group difference statistics above the predefined threshold in the significance map. The overall significance of the map is defined as the probability of finding, by chance alone, a statistical map with at least as large a surface area beating the predefined statistical threshold of P 5 0.05. This omnibus P value is commonly referred to as the overall significance of the map (or the features in the map), corrected for multiple comparisons. It basically quantifies the level of surprise in seeing a map with this amount of the surface exceeding a predefined threshold, under the null hypothesis of no systematic group differences. The permutation test on the overall rejection areas is used to evaluate the significance of overall experimental results and correct the overall significant P values for multiple comparisons.

Subjects with one e2 allele, i.e., e2/e3 and e2/e4 were excluded due to the possible protective effect of e2 allele for AD (Morra et al., 2009b) .

This protocol was adopted in several of our prior articles (Shi et al., 2013a (Shi et al., , 2013b Wang et al., 2010 Wang et al., , 2011 Wang et al., , 2013 as an empirical standard to compare effects in group difference analysis. We note that the deviation of the statistics from the null distribution generally increases from heterozygotes vs. noncarriers to homozygotes vs. noncarriers in both the full ADNI cohort and nondemented cohort studies.\nAs such, although more rigorous statistical tests are certainly necessary, from the p-maps and CDF plots, we can observe the trend that in all groups, APOE e4 homozygotes appear to differ more from noncarriers than do e4 heterozygotes, suggesting a clear APOE e4 dose effect."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "Prior studies of APOE e4 carriers (Caselli et al., , 2010 (Caselli et al., , 2011 Reiman, 2007) have helped to define and characterize preclinical AD with possible implications for primary AD prevention research. Essential to this effort are sensitive biomarkers that can track disease progression in the absence of symptoms. Imaging endophenotypes are promising, but further refinement of their relevance in early stage disease is needed (Frisoni et al., 2010) . MRI hippocampal morphometry may help move disease detection earlier and evaluate the effectiveness of promising disease-slowing and prevention therapies in a shorter time and a more cost-effective way. Much recent research has used brain imaging to study how APOE e4 allele affects hippocampal morphometry in patients and cognitively normal people (Farrer et al., 1997; Lehtovirta et al., 1995; Lemaitre et al., 2005; Morra et al., 2009a Morra et al., , 2009b Mueller and Weiner, 2009; Pievani et al., 2011; Qiu et al., 2009; Reiman et al., 1996; Shi et al., 2013a) .\nOur study has two main findings. First, as one of the largest hippocampal morphometry studies to date, involving 725 baseline ADNI subjects, we found that, for the nondemented subjects, the APOE e4 genotype is associated with greater hippocampal deformation. Second, our novel hippocampal surface morphometry method (Shi et al., 2013a (Shi et al., , 2013b , which involves conformal mapping, inverse consistent surface fluid registration and multivariate statistical analysis, automatically processed all ADNI baseline imaging data and was as or more sensitive to APOE e4 effects than some previously reported methods (e.g., Morra et al., 2009a Morra et al., , 2009b , that have used the ADNI dataset.\nOur work is related to the shape modeling of hippocampal surfaces. The Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM; Joshi and Miller, 2000) has been used to deform labeled anatomical templates of the hippocampus onto new images, using a combination of manual landmarking of points on the hippocampus and 3D fluid image registration (Csernansky et al., 2000; Haller et al., 1996; Wang et al., 2007) . In the LDDMM method, the surface of the hippocampus is parcellated a priori using a neuroanatomical template into three zones to approximate the locations of underlying subfields, and LDDMM is used to generate the hippocampal surfaces of all subjects and to register the surface zones across subjects. Another important shape modeling approach models the hippocampal surface using spherical harmonic functions (Gutman et al., 2009; Shen et al., 2009; Styner et al., 2004) , and uses the coefficients of the harmonic expansion to infer shape differences between patient groups and controls. Other methods (Van Leemput et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2003 Wang et al., , 2006 Yassa et al., 2010; Yushkevich et al., 2010 ) segment hippocampus into different regions and analyze the volume and shape changes in these subfields. These methods compute volumetric image registration between template and individual subject and translate and visualize the deformation on surfaces. In hippocampal subfield shape analysis work (Apostolova et al., 2010a; Cho et al., 2011; Morra et al., 2009a; Qiu et al., 2009; Shi et al., 2013a; Thompson et al., ) , the morphometry comparison was performed by registering hippocampal surfaces with geometric feature analysis. This type of methods affords the benefits of high resolution information from the hippocampal surface representation and efficient numerical solutions to register and analyze surface deformation across subjects."}, {"section_title": "Figure 8.", "text": "Illustration of cumulative distribution functions of the P values observed for the contrast of APOE e4 carriers versus noncarriers, plotted against the corresponding P value that would be expected under null hypothesis of no group difference, for the four experiments shown in Figures 6 and 7. We note that the deviation of the statistics from the null distribution generally increases from heterozygotes vs. noncarriers to homozygotes vs. noncarriers in both the full ADNI cohort and nondemented cohort studies, suggesting that the APOE e4 allele dose may be associated with more accelerated atrophy of hippocampus.\n[Color figure can be viewed in the online issue, which is available at wileyonlinelibrary.com.] In our APOE e4 carrier vs. noncarriers experiments, comparisons with both the nondemented and the full ADNI cohorts yielded significant differences that were apparently more pronounced on the left hippocampal surface. A prior study (Morra et al., 2009b) , which conducted similar experiments with a smaller number of images in ADNI baseline dataset (N 5 490) was only able to achieve significance for the left hippocampal surfaces on the full ADNI cohort but did not detect significant differences in the nondemented cohort. That aside, our finding of more significant areas on the left than on the right side, agree with (Morra et al., 2009b) , despite differences in our image segmentation methods, surface parameterization and registration algorithms, and statistics. Our results also agree with another APOE e4 study with manually segmented hippocampal surfaces (Pievani et al., 2011) .\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study to use a surfacebased approach to study APOE e4 gene dose effects on the hippocampal morphometry differences among subjects with two copies, one copy and no copies of the APOE e4 allele. Although most current approaches use cortical and substructural volume measures (den Heijer et al., 2010; Dewey et al., 2010; Holland et al., 2009; Jack et al., 2003 Jack et al., , 2004 Ridha et al., 2008; Vemuri et al., 2008a Vemuri et al., , 2008b Wolz et al., 2010) , recent research (Apostolova et al., 2010b (Apostolova et al., , 2010c Chou et al., 2009; Costafreda et al., 2011; Ferrarini et al., 2008; Luders et al., 2012; Madsen et al., 2010; Morra et al., 2009b; Qiu et al., 2010; Styner et al., 2005; Thompson et al., ; Yang et al., 2012) has demonstrated that surface-based subregional structure analysis can offer some advantages over volume measures. Our work identified significant differences in hippocampal shape between subjects heterozygous and homozygous for APOE e4 allele in the full ADNI study but did not detect such a difference on the nondemented cohort. When comparing these two groups with homozygous noncarriers (e3/e3), we detected significant differences in all four experiments. Furthermore, our empirical examination of the effect size clearly suggested that the homozygous APOE e4 carriers showed greater atrophy than heterozygous APOE e4 carriers in both full ADNI and nondemented cohorts.\nConsistent with prior studies of APOE e4 effects on hippocampal surfaces (e.g., Morra et al., 2009b; Pievani et al., 2011) , both heterozygous and homozygous APOE e4 patients show greater deformities for the left than the right hippocampus. By contrast with comparisons of APOE e4 carriers vs. noncarriers, differences between the heterozygous and homozygous APOE e4 groups were greater on the right side than on the left. Some prior research on hippocampal volume (Farrer et al., 1997; Lemaitre et al., 2005) also found that when comparing the heterozygous and homozygous APOE e4 groups, the right hippocampus may have more pronounced atrophy than the left side. However, contradictorily, when comparing these two groups with noncarriers, some other works (Farrer et al., 1997; Lemaitre et al., 2005) found greater atrophy on the right side. The inconsistency may be due to the algorithms used, as with surface-based method and the new statistics we introduced, more local subtle changes may be captured, which may be missed by the global volume-based method. More systematic validation and comparison studies are warranted.\nAnother important goal is to study differences between APOE e4 noncarriers and carriers within the cognitively normal group, i.e., healthy control subjects. As there were only two control subjects homozygous for the APOE e4 allele, tests of dose effects were underpowered in healthy control group. Thus we only compared APOE e4 carriers vs. noncarriers within the control group. Our experiments [N 5 177, 125 noncarriers (e3/e3) vs. 52 APOE e4 carriers (e3/e4 or e4/e4)] identified greater deformities on the left hippocampus than the right side but no statistically significant differences were detected after multiple comparisons correction (P 5 0.34). This is perhaps due to the low number of healthy control individuals with the APOE e4 genotype (Table I ). The association between APOE e4 and hippocampal atrophy may be detectable in a much larger sample.\nIn our work, we applied a nonparametric, multivariate permutation testing on Hotelling's T 2 statistics. Due to the Hotelling's T 2 test, comparisons of different genotype groups were only conducted pairwisely. However, the multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA; Smith et al., 1962) may be also applicable to analyze our multivariate statistics. MANOVA is a generalized form of univariate analysis of variance. It is used when there are two or more dependent variables. MANOVA has been successfully applied to human brain mapping research (e.g., Bartley et al., 1997; Poline et al., 1996) . It may be particularly useful for us to check the hippocampal morphometry differences among subjects with two copies, one copy and no copies of the APOE e4 allele. We plan to study MANOVA in our ongoing AD prevention research.\nThe current work focuses on describing structural differences at the group level and establishing the correlation between morphometry changes and genetic variance. The current work mainly explores the difference among multivariate statistics without considering the trends of the metric changes. Investigating the trend for multi-variables as a whole (in the context of multivariate type analysis) might be difficult, but it would be useful for us to explore this \"trend analysis\" on individual statistics. For example, a medically interesting question could be that, among these three groups (noncarriers, heterozygotes and homozygotes of e4), which individual statistics is more monotonic. In our prior work (Shi et al., 2013b) , we used TBM to visualize the metric trend for prematurity study but it may not be able to directly explain the outcome achieved with mTBM features. We plan to explore more along this direction in our future work. The answers to these questions will make our results more intuitive to be understood and eventually help our methods to be adopted quickly by the medical community.\nThis study has two limitations. First, as the participants are elderly, the ADNI subjects may not be the best r Genetic Influence of APOE e4 on Hippocampi r r 3913 r representative of patient populations in clinical trials. Our ongoing work that studies the Arizona APOE cohort ) which consists of cognitively normal subjects with a wider age span may validate or extend our current ADNI findings. We have obtained another cohort dataset from Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle Study of ageing (AIBL, 2013; Ellis et al., 2009 ). In addition, our ongoing research on Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis (Thompson et al., in press) may potentially provide new and rich datasets for crossvalidation. Replication attempts will be made to corroborate our current biomedical discoveries. Second, because of the extremely low number of APOE e2 carriers in ADNI dataset (Table I) , we excluded them from our APOE e4 studies but did not perform any additional studies to show that APOE e2 might be protective."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "We recently developed our MRI-based computerassisted hippocampal surface morphometry system that uses conformal maps to induce well-organized grids on surfaces. This simplifies a number of downstream computations of derivatives and metrics. In addition, the surface metric tensor, computable from the conformal grid, has a multivariate structure that contains a great deal of information on local surface geometry. Its components follow a log-Euclidean law that affects their possible range of values and their statistical distributions. The resulting set of surface tensor methods encodes a great deal of information that would otherwise be inaccessible, or overlooked.\nWe applied our system to study hippocampal shape differences between subjects in the ADNI dataset with two copies, one copy, and no copies of the APOE e4 allele, a common susceptibility gene for late-onset AD. We found significant differences between APOE e4 carriers and noncarriers in both full ADNI and nondemented cohorts, with more deformation of the left hippocampus than the right. Within the full ADNI cohort, the e4 homozygotes demonstrated more deformities than the e4 heterozygotes. Our work supports prior reports that the APOE e4 genotype is associated with accelerated brain atrophy along with disease progression, and that these differences can be mapped to morphological changes in subsections of the hippocampal surface. Future studies will test this framework in cognitively normal subjects for the detection of preclinical AD."}]
