A number of research criteria have been proposed to identify nondemented subjects with AD based on the presence of AD biomarkers [1] [2] [3] . They can be applied in subjects without cognitive impairment (asymptomatic at risk for AD or preclinical AD) and subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (MCI due to AD or prodromal AD). However, these criteria allow for different combinations of AD pathology biomarkers, and it is unknown whether this impacts on observed changes in outcome measures. For trial design, it is critical to understand how selection criteria for subjects at such early stages of the disease influence change in outcome measures. Previous studies on outcome measures typically had a short follow-up, did not compare the effect of different inclusion criteria, or restricted their analyses to a limited set of outcome measures [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] .\nThe aim of our study was to investigate whether changes in outcome measures are dependent on the inclusion criteria for preclinical and prodromal AD used. We studied three definitions for preclinical and prodromal AD: (1) having abnormal amyloid markers; (2) having abnormal amyloid markers and normal neuronal injury markers; and (3) having both abnormal amyloid and neuronal injury markers. As outcome measures, we used biomarkers for amyloid b (Ab) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or on positron emission tomography (PET), CSF tau, fludeoxyglucose PET (FDG-PET), brain atrophy measured with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and measures of cognitive functioning. To study the potential effects of different combinations of inclusion criteria and outcome measures on trial design, we calculated sample sizes for a hypothetical 3-year placebo-controlled trial in subjects at predementia AD stages. To study the additive value of biomarkers to define predementia AD, we also calculated slopes and sample sizes for subjects with normal cognition and MCI, regardless of their biomarker status."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative study", "text": "We studied data from subjects that participated in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study (adni. loni.usc.edu).

For slope analyses, we used an unstructured covariance matrix, assuming a random intercept and fixed slope, and used follow-up time as repeated measure. We assumed a linear change in time (time coded with a quadratic term was not statistically significant). Separate analyses were performed for each criterion used to classify predementia AD. Difference with a P-value ,.05 were considered to be statistically significant. Sample size was estimated for a hypothetical 3-year randomized-controlled trial with two arms, showing an expected treatment effect of 25% reduction of decline in outcome measures with a power of 80%, a two-sided alpha of 5%, and a 10% annual dropout rate using the following formula [25] :\nwith D as the difference in mean rate of decline in treatment versus control, s 2 e as the residual error variance of the mixed effects model, a as the type I error rate of a two-sided test and 12b as the power, t i as the times i at which measures were made, and t mean as the average follow-up time. The total sample size n required for a trial was then obtained by multiplying this estimation by 2 and adjusted for an annual dropout rate of 10% over the course of 3 years (n/arm* 2 * 1.11 3 ). Finally, we calculated the numbers needed to be screened, which is the sample size needed in a specific subgroup divided by the prevalence of this group in subjects with the same cognitive status. All analyses were stratified for baseline diagnosis. Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of the subjects with normal cognition according to different classification criteria. Subjects classified as preclinical AD stage-2 were older (P 5 .036), had smaller hippocampal volumes (P 5 .014), and, by definition, higher CSF tau and lower FDG-PET binding (P , .001) in comparison to preclinical stage-1 subjects. Table 2 shows the change in biomarkers and cognitive markers over time. In subjects with normal cognition, regardless of biomarkers status, all markers showed worsening over time, except for the ADAS-Cog, and both ADCS-PACC composite scores. Subjects with preclinical AD and preclinical AD stage-1 showed increases over time in amyloid PET, CSF tau levels, CDR-sob and ventricular volumes, and decreases in FDG-PET, whole-brain volume, and hippocampal volume. Subjects with preclinical AD stage-2 showed increases over time in ventricular volume and the CDR-sob, and decreases in CSF Ab 1-42 levels, whole-brain volume, and hippocampal volume. In subjects with preclinical AD, the rate of hippocampal volume loss and increase in CDR-sob were faster for those classified as belonging to stage-2 than those to stage-1 ( Table 2) .

Sample size estimates for a hypothetical 3-year clinical trial varied widely according to the combination of inclusion criteria and outcome markers applied. The smallest sample size needed to show a treatment effect was estimated for subjects with normal cognition or MCI who had both abnormal amyloid and injury markers at baseline using brain volumetric markers as outcome measure.\nSubjects with normal cognition showed a worsening over time in all markers, except the ADAS-Cog, ADCS-PACC like composite score, and ADCS-PACC without digit NOTE.

Data are mean (standard error). **P , .01, *P , .05 indicates a slope different from 0. symbol test. When taking into account biomarkers, worsening was typically greater in subjects with preclinical stage-2 than in subjects with preclinical stage-1. In subjects with MCI, all markers became more abnormal over time.\nWorsening of outcome markers was greater for subjects with prodromal stage-2 than for subjects with prodromal stage-1. Our observation of larger effects in outcome measures for subjects at more advanced disease stages is in line with reports of previous studies [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . Because subjects in stage-2 showed the most worsening over time in all outcome markers, the absolute difference between treated and nontreated groups in our hypothetical trial was the largest as well, and so subsequent sample size estimates were smaller for this group of subjects.\nFor all definitions of preclinical AD, brain atrophy outcome measures showed the most worsening over time and subsequently resulted in the smallest sample size estimates. This estimate was the smallest for preclinical AD stage-2. Amyloid markers showed some worsening over time, but acceptable sample size estimates based on amyloid were only obtained in preclinical AD stage-2 when CSF Ab 1-42 was used as an outcome measure and in preclinical AD stage-1 when 18 F-AV-45-PET was used. In preclinical AD stage-2, when neuronal injury was defined based on CSF tau, no changes in FDG-PET were observed, which might reflect floor effects in this group of subject and this is in line with previous studies [31, 32] . None of the cognitive measures showed decline over time. NOTE. N after outcome variable indicates the number of subject from the total sample with at least 1 follow-up measure available.

Data are mean (95% confidence interval).\nAlso, for all definitions of prodromal AD in MCI patients, brain atrophy outcome measures showed the most worsening over time and yielded the smallest sample size estimate. The smallest sample size estimate was observed for prodromal AD stage-2. In these subjects, amyloid measures and CSF tau levels showed limited change over time, which resulted in very large sample size estimates. FDG-PET showed some decline and this resulted in reasonable sample size estimates. Of the cognitive measures, the smallest sample size estimate was obtained with the CDR-sob and ADCS-PACC without digit symbol test, which became the most abnormal over a time.\nAcross all predementia subjects, the inclusion criteria incorporating AD biomarkers considerably reduced sample size estimates. However, this was at the expense of an increase in the number of subjects needed to be screened, since only a subset of subjects with normal cognition or MCI have abnormal AD biomarkers. Still, despite the large numbersneeded-to-be-screened, a previous cost-benefit analysis showed that enriching trials by refining inclusion criteria with the use of a CSF Ab 1-42 /tau in MCI can reduce trial costs with 60%, because fewer subjects are needed to show an effect, and this outweighs the increased costs for screening [33] .\nThe observation that both in subjects with preclinical AD and in subjects with prodromal AD CSF Ab 1-42 decreased in stage-2 but not in stage-1, whereas 18 F-AV-45-PET changed in stage-1 but not in stage-2 suggests that these markers (in part) reflect different disease processes, although it should be noted that the slopes of change did not differ between stage-1 and stage-2 [34] .\nIn our fictive trial, we found reduced sample size estimates when enriching for AD biomarkers, and this is in line with sample size estimates from previous studies that used a similar fictive trial design approach. In preclinical AD, one study found that with CDR-sob and the MMSE score as outcome measure, the use of an abnormal amyloid marker for inclusion reduced sample size relative to cognitively subjects unselected for biomarkers although sample size estimates in that study were twice as high as in our study [5, 11] . Our observed lack of change on the PACC may limit its use as endpoint in preclinical AD trials with a 3-year duration. Longer trial durations are necessary to detect potential treatment effects on cognitive outcomes in preclinical AD (Supplementary Table 20) . A recent study using a subset of ADNI subjects with normal cognition showed that when constructing a cognitive composite measure using information from cognitive tests scores of those subjects who show clinical decline, the power to detect changes might be improved [35] . However, in subjects with preclinical AD this optimized composite measure showed only minimal change over time. Two other studies reported similar to our results a reduction of sample size estimates for hippocampal, ventricular and whole-brain volumes, and/or MMSE in prodromal AD compared with unspecified MCI [12, 36] . While another study found that sample sizes were smaller for prodromal AD stage-2 than prodromal AD [9] . In addition, APOE \u03b54 allele carriership as an additional risk marker might lead to even smaller size estimates [24, 36, 37] . Although these previous studies show that AD biomarkers can decrease sample size estimates, none of these studies have compared the impact on these estimates of amyloid, injury, and clinical outcome markers over different preclinical and prodromal AD stages. Our study further extents these findings, as we covered all predementia stages of AD and demonstrated that also the stages influence sample size estimates. "}, {"section_title": "Methodological issues", "text": "For our power calculation, we made several assumptions that might have influenced our findings. We used linear mixed models with random intercepts and a fixed slope to assess changes over time in outcome measures. The use of a fixed slope might have underestimated sample sizes because it does not take into account variability in slopes between subjects [7, 10] . In a post hoc analysis, we found that the use of random slope models indeed resulted in larger sample size estimates, although the model did not converge for several outcome variables ( Supplementary  Tables 3 and 4) . Also, for the present analyses we used effect sizes of 25%, which can be considered to be an upper bound for a relatively small, but clinically relevant effect size. Larger effect sizes provide smaller sample size estimations, and lower numbers needed to screen. For example, with a hypothetical reduction of 35% sample sizes would be 45% smaller (Supplementary Tables 14-17 ). In addition, we did not correct for age effects in our slopes' analyses, although these are likely to be present in cognitively normal subjects with normal AD markers [7, 10] . It can be argued that one should not correct age effects because it cannot be excluded that even in cognitively normal subjects, with normal AD markers at baseline, the change in outcome effects is still reflecting (in part) AD and which might lead to an underestimation of treatment effects. Still, we performed additional post hoc analyses correcting for age, and this resulted in increased sample sizes or, in the case of preclinical AD stage-1, were often not estimable (Supplementary Tables 5 and 6 ). Of note is that sample size estimates for MCI subjects in stage-1 and stage-2 increased for neuronal injury outcome measures and remained comparable for cognitive outcome measures. A similar effect has been reported by a recent study in another study sample [36] . Possibly this difference reflects that brain structural changes are more intertwined with aging, making it difficult to detangle age from disease processes. Cognitive outcome measures seemed to be less affected by aging, but this might also reflect the much slower pace of decline in preclinical AD for these measures. In our design, we chose to model a hypothetical trial in which a treatment effect would result in a reduced change, to illustrate the effect of different inclusion criteria and outcome measure on sample size estimates. Other sample size estimates would be obtained in designs that assume that treatment might result in biomarker or cognitive improvements. In our analysis, we combined amyloid and injury markers either based on CSF or PET markers, which might have influenced our results because these modalities might reflect different processes. Post hoc analysis in subjects with markers for both modalities showed that the concordance for amyloid status was 85% for subjects with normal cognition and 92% for subjects with MCI (Supplementary Table 7) , similar to previous studies [34, [38] [39] [40] . Concordance for preclinical stage-1 and stage-2 classification in subjects who were amyloid positive on both CSF and PET was 85% for preclinical AD and 50% for prodromal AD (Supplementary Table 8 ). Additional exploratory analyses for the subgroup of prodromal AD with classification using only CSF measures provided slope and sample size estimates largely comparable to the total group of stage-1 and stage-2 subjects (Supplementary  Table 19 ). We used FDG-PET as a neuronal injury marker, if amyloid was measured with a PET tracer. However, using two PET, markers may be impractical. We therefore repeated these analyses with hippocampal volume as a neuronal injury marker. We found a concordance of FDG-PET hypometabolism and hippocampal atrophy of 74% for subjects with normal cognition and of 64% for MCI patients (Supplementary Table 9 ). Slope and sample size estimates were largely similar (Supplementary Tables 10-13 ), suggesting that MRI-based hippocampal volume can be used as a more practical alternative to FDG-PET for neuronal injury definition.\nOur findings show that the definition of predementia AD influences the effects that can be found for outcome measures. This has important implications for trial design. For our hypothetical trial in subjects with preclinical AD, the estimated sample sizes were smallest in subjects at stage-2, using volumetric markers as outcome measurement. In subjects with prodromal AD, the smallest sample size estimates were obtained when including subjects at stage-2, using brain volume and cognitive measures as outcome measurements. Although a change in cognition would be the most clinically relevant outcome, the estimated sample sizes required to demonstrate effects on such markers were about three to four times larger than estimates based on MRI markers. This highlights the need for novel cognitive tests that are more sensitive for cognitive decline in subjects with preclinical and prodromal AD [11, 41] "}]
