[{"section_title": "2", "text": "American Sociological Review XX (X) These trends reflect a gradual shift in the responsibility for U.S. higher education funding-from state and federal subsidies to individual families (Lucas 1996; Price 2004) . As public schools begin to operate more like private schools and rely heavily on tuition dollars, and federal funds for higher education fail to absorb the cost to students, the role of parents becomes even more central. Parents often become the primary financiers of higher education.\nTo send their children to college, parents often make difficult financial decisions. Financing children's education comes at a considerable cost for many, as they dip into family savings or pull from retirement accounts. Yet, little work examines whether parental dollars translate into quantifiable benefits for students. Simply put, can parents purchase a better college outcome for their children? Do parental dollars boost student performance? Or is there a point of diminishing returns, even a negative influence? These questions are important not only for individual parents as they make decisions about how much to fund their children, but also for policymakers in understanding implications of a funding structure that rests squarely on parents' shoulders.\nThe central goal of this article is to determine what effect financial parental investments have on two key postsecondary education outcomes: grade point average (GPA) and degree completion. I rely on data from three nationally representative datasets of postsecondary students collected by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) to address the following empirical questions: 1) What is the direction and magnitude of parental aid's influence on student GPA and bachelor's degree completion, net of student sociodemographics, parental socioeconomic status (SES), family structure, academic ability, student characteristics, and institution characteristics? 2) What are the effects of parental aid when accounting for other sources of financial aid, in both relative and absolute terms?"}, {"section_title": "Provision of Parental Aid", "text": "Deil-Amen and Turley (2007) note that relatively little research within the sociology of higher education focuses on college financing. One exception is examination of factors shaping how much parental aid parents provide. Higher socioeconomic status parents are more likely to assume their children will attend college, have the resources to pay for it, and make the necessary financial plans (Flint 1992; Olson and Rosenfeld 1984) . Family structure also plays a role. Married parents contribute larger amounts of money to their children's college education (Turley and Desmond 2011) . When there are greater numbers of siblings, especially if they are closely spaced, each child may receive less (Downey 1995; Steelman and Powell 1989) . Parents may invest more in children with higher academic aspirations and in children who demonstrate higher levels of achievement, although evidence for the latter is mixed (Flint 1997; Powell and Steelman 1995) . The cost of education also matters. Pricier schools often require greater parental contributions, and students self-select based on ability to pay (Paulsen and St. John 2002) . Institutions typically provide scholarships based on prior achievement, and students can also receive funds from programs such as National Merit Scholarships. This type of aid tends to disproportionately benefit students from affluent families who arrive with stronger records (Carnevale and Strohl 2010) . Need-based aid is usually calculated using the expected family contribution (EFC) and does not take into account the actual amount of parental assistance students will receive. 2 The net cost to families includes the EFC plus any additional costs not met by merit, need, or other forms of aid (e.g., military or employer benefits). Students and their parents must decide how to cover these costs-using different types of loans, savings, or earnings.\nEven if we match students on all the above characteristics, we might expect considerable heterogeneity in how much aid parents offer their children. Indeed, attendance at a four-year college epitomizes a relatively new life stage, young adulthood-a period of the life course devoted to academic, career, and selfdevelopment (Rosenfeld 2007; Settersten and Ray 2010) . In many ways, young adulthood mirrors the development of adolescence around the turn of the twentieth century, in that it is not yet fully institutionalized or universal (Furstenberg, Rumbaut, and Settersten 2005; Osgood et al. 2005; Zelizer 1985) . Compared to parenting younger children, there is currently less consensus about what amount of financial support constitutes good parenting for college students-even within social class categories.\nPast research on intergenerational effects of parental funding for college underscores this point. Accounting for income and education, parents who received financial support for college from their own parents are significantly more likely to provide higher levels of aid for their offspring (Flint 1997 ). Here we see evidence that a cultural understanding about young adulthood-transmitted across generations-shapes parental investment in college. College funding thus cannot be understood as entirely a matter of financial calculus. Not all parents who can afford to do so will cover the costs of college, and some with limited resources will find ways to provide more than expected."}, {"section_title": "Effects of Parental Aid", "text": "Sociological knowledge of the effects of parental support for older youth is limited, although recent work notes links to college attendance. For example, Charles, Roscigno, and Torres (2007) demonstrate that parental investments-including financial support for college-can explain the Black-White gap in college attendance. Kim and Schneider (2005) show that parental social capital helps parents channel outside information and financial resources to increase the likelihood that students successfully transition into higher education. These findings are consistent with a growing awareness that extending parental investment later into the life course provides youth with distinct advantages (Osgood et al. 2005; Settersten and Ray 2010) . However, the extent to which parental investments, specifically parental aid, shape specific academic outcomes for college students remains largely unexplored.\nAs Bowen and Shapiro (1998) note, this issue plagues work on college funding more generally. Most scholarship has focused on the link between aid and access and has not adequately addressed the effects of aid on college achievement and completion. Some recent research has begun to move beyond access. For example, scholars have shown that in some cases merit-based aid can boost achievement (Henry and Rubenstein 2002; Stater 2009) , and other researchers have begun to trace the receipt of grants and scholarships to degree completion (DesJardins, Ahlburg, and McCall 2002; Dynarski 2003) . Similarly, Paulsen and St. John (2002) indicate that unmet need is a barrier to persistence. Parental aid, however, has been largely excluded from these efforts (but see Steelman and Powell 1989) .\nInattention to effects of parental aid during college is surprising given the importance of postsecondary achievement for students' life chances. For example, GPA can fundamentally shape students' movement into advanced degree programs and boost earning power (Jones and Jackson 1990; Loury and Garman 1995; Mullen, Goyette, and Soares 2003) . Degree completion is associated with greater access to higher paying and more privileged occupations, a higher probability of marriage, better health, greater civic participation, and intellectual development (for a review, see Stevens, Armstrong, and Arum 2008) . Understanding what role parental investments play in influencing these key educational outcomes is thus central to the goals of stratification research.\nTwo frameworks offer divergent views on how parental investments shape student GPA and degree completion. Studies from status attainment, human capital, and cultural capital traditions operate from a more-is-more perspective. This lens suggests that children use parents' calculated allocations in service of 4 American Sociological Review XX (X) higher education. According to this approach, increasing parental investments improve, or at the very least do not harm, student performance. In contrast, I examine a more-is-less perspective that is rooted in a different rational choice model of human behavior and is often implied in recent concerns over young adults' financial dependence on their parents. The theory of moral hazard suggests that parental investments may create a disincentive for student achievement."}, {"section_title": "Traditional Approaches to Parental Investment: More Is More", "text": "The first framework, more-is-more, draws from sociological traditions that identify parental investment in education as a key mechanism driving the reproduction of advantage. For example, status attainment modelswhich dominate stratification research in sociology-postulate that an individual's socioeconomic destination is a function of ability, background, aspirations, and parental investments in education. Research has examined many forms of parental investments, including social psychological aspects (e.g., educational aspirations), financial capital, cultural capital, and social capital (Blau and Duncan 1967; Coleman 1988; Downey 1995; Sewell and Hauser 1976) . Central to this particular investigation, Steelman and Powell (1989) identify financial investments in postsecondary education as a previously little recognized factor in status attainment processes.\nThese models often imply that parental investments link class origins and destinations via a series of calculated exchanges, characteristic of a rational choice perspective. For example, in the human capital model (Becker 1964 ) parents intentionally direct financial resources to their children's education, expecting children to optimize these funds by accruing skills and credentials necessary for future socioeconomic success. Scholarship from a cultural perspective-perhaps best illustrated by Bourdieu (1984;  see also Lareau 2011)-suggests that parents cultivate valuable social tastes, interests, skills, and dispositions through exposure to certain educational and extracurricular contexts. This process can occur through calculated intent or a less direct absorption of one's social and cultural environs.\nThis research shares a basic tenet: parental investments in education have a positive effect on children's academic, occupational, and economic fates. There is little room in status attainment, human capital, or cultural approaches for ineffective or even problematic parental educational investments. These core sociological traditions implicitly (and sometimes explicitly) suggest that more is better than less, and that parents cannot invest too much in their children."}, {"section_title": "Young Adulthood and Moral Hazard: More Is Less", "text": "A more-is-more perspective is deeply ingrained in the sociology of education. In recent years, however, concern about parental investment has grown as the responsibilities ascribed to parents continue to expand and extend further into the life course (Acocella 2008) . Intentionally crafting opportunities for children's intellectual, social, and emotional growth has become an accepted norm of middle-class parenting-and one that may generate its own set of problems (Hays 1996; Lareau 2011; Warner 2006) . For youth reaching the end of adolescence, this parenting may be primarily financial in nature.\nScholars have begun to note the possible high cost of creating a young-adult life stage where parents free youth from the realities of financial responsibility (Danziger and Rouse 2007) . Some evidence indicates that allowing youth to postpone adult statuses, like fulltime employment, may have unintended effects on their independence. For example, Newman and Aptekar (2007) document an increasing delay in leaving the natal home in Western Europe-a pattern also seen in the United States. Similarly, Lareau (2011) describes early educational benefits of an intensive logic of childrearing, but her work also hints at issues of entitlement among young adults who are used to having their needs met by parents. These emerging observations raise questions about how far into the life course parental investments continue to be beneficial.\nSuch concerns tap into an alternative theoretical framework for understanding parental financial aid in college, where more may actually be less. Moral hazard theory, like prior sociological research on parental investment, is derived from a rational choice perspective on human interactions (Heimer 1988) . The assumptions, however, are much different. Moral hazard arises in situations of information asymmetry: individuals insulated from risk behave in ways not compatible with their investors' goals. This may occur because they are not fully accountable for potential consequences and may pursue different interests.\n3 When applied to this case, moral hazard theory suggests that parental aid can provide an educational disincentive for children. Children may direct more effort to school when they personally feel the economic costs of poor performance.\nIn earlier stages of education, children spend the majority of time under the watchful gaze of teachers or parents. During college, particularly when students live on-campus and away from home, parents are less able to monitor their children's academic behaviors to ensure sanctioned use of educational resources. Parental aid may also have unique characteristics distinguishing it from most other forms of aid. For example, grants and scholarships are often merit-based and come with strict performance standards that may keep students focused. Similarly, work-study and veteran benefits require students to have personal responsibility in obtaining funds, which may translate into greater investment in academic performance. Loans are the only other source of aid that is generally not tied to performance and may divert financial responsibility from students during college-especially if students are not responsible for payments.\nSome studies suggest this more-is-less framework may be promising. For example, Davila and Mora (2004) invoke moral hazard to explain why children of self-employed entrepreneurial parents underperform in relation to their peers. They posit that these students are less motivated because of anticipated economic security through the family business. Economists Bodvarsson and Walker (2004) found that among a small sample of students at two Midwestern schools, parental aid for tuition and books significantly weakened self-reported academic achievement. This study suggests the need for more rigorous testing. Finally, a large (although conflicted) literature on effects of student employment on performance indicates the importance of personal financial responsibility. Several studies have found no effects (Curtis and Nummer 1991) or positive effects of low to moderate levels of student employment on GPA (Kalenkoski and Pabilonia 2008; Pike, Kuh, and Massa-McKinley 2008) .\nThis scholarship suggests that young adulthood, sponsored by parental funds, may provide a context in which more is less. Here, parental funds set the stage for moral hazard by offsetting costs associated with low academic performance. From this perspective, parental aid will not boost GPA or the likelihood of graduating and may even prove detrimental."}, {"section_title": "Reverse Causality and Selectivity Processes", "text": "These two perspectives point to parental aid as a causal mechanism in college students' performance. However, the casual arrow may be reversed. For example, more may look like more if, as noted earlier, parents invest more in better performing students (Powell and Steelman 1995) . In contrast, research from earlier levels of schooling suggests parents may invest more in students who are disadvantaged in some way, as a compensatory mechanism (Hamilton, Cheng, and Powell 2007; Teachman, Paasch, and Carver 1997) .\nSelectivity processes may also create a situation where less motivated or less talented students are more likely to receive parental investments. Because parental aid increases access to college, students with parental assistance will likely display a wider range of ability 6 American Sociological Review XX (X) and motivation. In contrast, students who make it to college with little to no parental help may not only be exceptionally talented but also uniquely motivated-for which there is no good empirical proxy (Gambetta 1987; Torche 2011) . Unobserved heterogeneity among the college student population may thus drive a similar empirical finding as processes of moral hazard, but for different reasons. More may look like less if students receiving greater amounts of support are qualitatively different from those who do not receive similar help. When relevant, I address these possibilities with selectivity analyses using fixed-effects models."}, {"section_title": "DATA, MEASURES, AND METHODS", "text": "Primary analyses rely on two nationally representative postsecondary datasets collected by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES): the Baccalaureate and Beyond Study 1993 (B&B93) and the Beginning Postsecondary Students Study 1990 to 1994 (BPS90/94). These datasets are linked to the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS), which includes unparalleled data on elements of college students' funding situations, institution and student characteristics, and academic records. Unlike more recent NPSAS-linked data, these datasets offer continuous, rather than dichotomous or categorical, measures of parental aid.\nWhere GPA is the outcome of interest, I focus on the B&B93. This dataset includes a nationally representative sample of around 12,000 undergraduate students in their final year at their U.S. bachelor's granting institution during 1992 to 1993. The B&B93 is preferred for its large and representative sample of students in four-year schools, but a sample of students in their final year is not appropriate for analyses in which bachelor's degree completion is the key outcome. For these analyses, I turn to the BPS90/94, which follows a nationally representative sample of first-year students attending postsecondary institutions of any type in the United States during 1989 to 1990. This dataset includes around 4,000 students who started at fouryear schools and were not lost before the final follow-up.\nFor both datasets, I used multiple imputation techniques appropriate for data missing completely at random (MCAR) or missing at random (MAR). I generated m = 10 complete datasets with multiple imputation by chained equations, which uses the observed data to simulate plausible missing values (Royston 2005) . I analyzed each of the m datasets individually and combined results to produce estimates that account for missing data uncertainty (Little and Rubin 2002) . As indicated by von Hippel (2007) , I used the dependent variable in imputation but excluded cases missing on the dependent variable from analysis (although including them does not alter the findings presented here).\n4 As a result, the sample size for the B&B93 analyses is 10,870 students; for the BPS90/94 it is 3,810 students.\n5 Table 1 reports the percent of imputed values in the analytic sample. The BPS90/94 shows fewer imputed values overall, given that cases not present in the final wave were excluded prior to imputation."}, {"section_title": "6", "text": "For the GPA analyses-which produce a surprising finding-I also included analyses from the Beginning Postsecondary Students Study 1996 to 2001 (BPS96/01) to confirm the B&B93 findings and address selectivity processes. As with the BPS90/94, I restricted the sample to students who started their first year in four-year schools. For this dataset, I only included students who were age 30 years or younger because older respondents were not asked about parental assistance.\nThe BPS96/01 provides limited information on parental aid and student GPA at three points throughout college : 1996, 1998, and 2001 (2001 data include final GPAs for respondents who graduated). This allows me to estimate fixed-effects models, which make comparisons within students rather than between them. These models estimate parameters for variables that experience any amount of temporal variance, even if only within a subset of cases, and control for effects of American Sociological Review XX (X) variables that are time invariant. Fixed-effects models are thus appropriate for addressing issues of unobserved heterogeneity, because effects of relatively stable factors that typically vary only between individuals (e.g., gender, parental background, and prior performance), as well as intelligence, academic preparation, and motivation, are canceled out. The fixedeffects models presented here rely on an unbalanced panel of 7,210 students, observed one to three times throughout college (for a total of 18,050 student-year observations). Only 130 students are lost to missing data."}, {"section_title": "Key Dependent and Independent Measures", "text": "Variables are coded in the same way across the B&B93 and BPS90/94 datasets, except where noted. See Table 1 for descriptive statistics from imputation dataset m = 1. 7 I discuss the variables included in the supplemental BPS96/01 analyses later.\nStudent GPA. The first dependent variable is student GPA (multiplied by 100).\n8 Studies often use student-reported GPA, but the tendency to overreport is higher among some sets of students than others, potentially leading to spurious or inaccurate findings (Kuncel, Crede, and Thomas 2005) . Thus I use institution-reported data."}, {"section_title": "9", "text": "Degree completion. The second dependent variable is a dichotomous measure of whether students received a bachelor's degree five years after they started college.\nParental financial aid. The key independent variable is parental financial aid for college. The continuous measure reports a dollar amount for all direct financial transfers that both parents made on behalf of their children during the academic year in question-covering tuition and fees as well as money for books, rent, living expenses, food, clothing, and transportation.\n10 Table 1 shows the mean amount of parental aid received by students in both datasets; as we might expect, it is higher for the sample of first-year students. This number obscures class differences in the provision of parental aid. Indeed, we see a correlation between income and parental aid (r = .396, p < .001 for B&B93; r = .461, p < .001 for BPS90/94). As noted earlier, however, there are theoretical reasons to expect heterogeneity in the provision of student aid for students who look quite similar on objective indicators, like parental income. Comparison of students on the basis of their propensity for receiving any parental aid (calculated using the explanatory variables below) suggests overlap among the type of students who receive no parental aid, some aid, and very high levels of aid. For instance, in the B&B93 imputed data, students who received no aid have an average propensity score of .40-this indicates a fair number of students did not receive aid despite profiles that would suggest otherwise. Similarly, respondents who received more than $30,000 have an average propensity score of .88-this suggests that some students who accepted high levels of aid were not expected to receive any at all. Values for parental aid-like all monetary variables in the analyses-are positively skewed. For example, in m = 1 of the B&B93, 42.72 percent of students received no parental aid, 31.98 percent received less than $5,000, 12.17 percent received between $5,000 and $10,000, 9.38 percent received between $10,000 and $20,000, and 3.75 percent received $20,000 or more (with a maximum of $40,000). I thus take the log of all monetary variables.\n11 Analyses restricted to students receiving far smaller amounts (e.g., less than $5,000) produce consistent results and suggest that outliers are not driving the findings presented below."}, {"section_title": "Explanatory Variables", "text": "The analyses also include a number of additional explanatory variables shown to shape student GPA and BA completion, as well as the provision of parental aid."}, {"section_title": "12", "text": "Basic sociodemographics. Research shows that women receive more parental aid for higher education (Powell and Steelman 1995) .\nWomen have higher college GPAs than men, on average, and enjoy an advantage in college completion (Buchmann and DiPrete 2006; Sax and Harper 2007) . Older students, who generally do not attend college right after high school, also have higher GPAs (Burton et al. 2009 ). At the same time, nontraditional students may find it more difficult to persist, because they are more likely to have heavy work and family demands (Brown 2002) . I therefore include controls for gender and age.\nI include racial categories (with White as the reference) and Hispanic as a separate dichotomous variable. At the multivariate level, Asian students receive the highest levels of parental aid, and Blacks receive the lowest (Powell and Steelman 1995) . Whites and Asians have the highest GPAs; Hispanic and Black students tend to have lower GPAs (Fischer 2007) . Black students are at the highest risk for educational stopout, although this is primarily due to other factors such as lower family income (DesJardins, Ahlburg, and McCall 2006).\n"}, {"section_title": "Parental SES.", "text": "A vast body of literature links parental income and education to positive educational outcomes (Blau and Duncan 1967; Jencks et al. 1972; Sewell and Hauser 1976) . This relationship is thought to exist in large part due to parental investments. Higher levels of parental income and education boost parental investments that are assumed to have a positive effect on student outcomes. Wealthier and better educated parents, however, may provide other advantages-such as high educational aspirations for their children-that lead to these benefits. This set of controls is thus essential for determining if financial investments themselves boost student performance or run counter to effects of parental background. I treat education as a series of dummies, with high school degree or less as the reference category.\nThe NPSAS collects parental income only for legally dependent college studentsregardless of how much parental aid children receive. The majority of students in both datasets are legal dependants of their parents. For legally independent students, I use the student's own income and include a variable indicating independent status in the analyses. Because there is a correlation between independent status and the log of parental aid (r = -.470, p < .001 for B&B93; r = -.260, p < .001 for BPS90/94), including it provides a conservative estimate of effects of parental aid.\nFamily structure. Turley and Desmond (2011) demonstrate that parents who are married to each other provide the greatest financial contributions. Research also indicates that students from divorced families do not perform as well in school as do those from nondivorced families (Amato 2001) . I include a dummy variable indicating married-as opposed to single, remarried, or divorced-parents.\nStrain placed on family resources by other family members also shapes provision of parental aid (Downey 1995; Powell and Steelman 1995) . Therefore, I account for the number of family members in college. This measure, like income, is reported on the basis of dependency.\nAcademic ability. Although imperfect, SAT scores are perhaps the most commonly used predictor of academic ability and I thus include them here (Camara and Echternacht 2000) . In cases where SAT scores were not available, I used the SAT-converted ACT score. Because research has identified college GPA as a factor shaping persistence, degree completion analyses also include first-year GPA as an independent variable (Cabrera, Nora, and Castaneda 1993) . The B&B93 and BPS90/94 do not include high school GPA, but the supplemental fixed-effects analyses using the BPS96/01 account for this timeinvariant factor.\nStudent characteristics. I include a series of dummies for major, with engineering (which has the lowest average GPA) as the reference.\n13 I also account for enrollment status (full-year or part-year), intensity (fulltime or part-time), and residency (in-state or out-of-state). Institution characteristics. Because student GPAs are higher on average at private institutions, I include a measure of institution control (public versus private) (Rojstaczer 2002) . When accounting for student quality, increasing selectivity depresses GPA but increases the likelihood of graduation (Alexander and Eckland 1977; Alon and Tienda 2005) . I therefore include institutions' scores on the 1992 Barron's Admissions Competitiveness Index. Barron's Index ranges from noncompetitive (1) to most competitive (6) and is based on four criteria: SAT/ACT scores of students accepted in the previous year, GPA required for admission, class rank required for admission, and percentage of applicants accepted the previous year. I also include a measure of tuition cost, because it directly shapes how much money parents provide.\n14 Alternative funding. In the final set of analyses for each dependent variable, I include measures of aid from alternative sources-grants and scholarships, loans, work-study, and other aid (e.g., veteran benefits).\n15 I pulled information on alternative aid sources from federal and institutional files, as part of the NPSAS. Because educational funds are often derived from student employment, I also include a measure of money earned starting June 30 of the year in question and ending July 1 of the following year."}, {"section_title": "Analytic Approach", "text": "The article is organized in two main sections. First, I examine the influence of parental financial aid on student GPA. Then, I move to its effects on degree completion. For each outcome variable I proceed as follows. I estimate a bivariate model, in which parental aid is used to predict the outcome of interest. I then include student sociodemographics and parental SES-because these variables are central to most education and stratification research-and move to a full model adding family structure, academic ability, student characteristics, and institution characteristics. Next, I account for alternative funding, including grants and scholarships, loans, work-study, other aid (e.g., veteran benefits), and funds earned through student employment. I treat parental aid both as a relative measure-in which it is divided by the total aid package-and as an absolute measure (alongside the absolute amounts derived from alternative sources). Finally, for the GPA analyses, I present supplemental, fixed-effects estimates as a way of cross-checking patterns and addressing the possibility that unique characteristics of college students without support are driving the findings. Table 2 presents coefficients for the regression of GPA on parental aid (logged) and other explanatory variables. Model 1 indicates that at the bivariate level, an increase in parental aid is associated with a decrease in student GPA (b = \u22122.182, p < .001)."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Student GPA", "text": "16 This effect is apparent even though parental aid operates as a proxy for a host of different social processes linked to parental background.\nModel 2 helps to disentangle effects of social class from parental aid with the addition of controls for sociodemographics and parental SES. The model again indicates that as parental aid increases, student GPA decreases (b = \u22122.233, p < .001). At the same time, parental income and education work at cross-purposes with parental investments. As income increases, so does student GPA, and having a parent with an advanced degree (as opposed to a high school degree or less) is associated with a significant increase in GPA. Model 2 also shows that women and older students have significantly higher GPAs. White students (the reference category) have the highest GPAs, followed by Asians, students of other races, and Blacks. Students who identify as Hispanic have significantly lower GPAs than other respondents.\nModel 3 adds variables capturing family structure, academic ability, student characteristics, and institution characteristics. Notably, the significant negative effect of parental aid on student GPA persists and, if anything, is magnified (b = \u22124.570, p < .001). 17 Here, the positive effect of parental education is no longer apparent. In fact, having a parent with some college or a college degree significantly decreases student GPA. As a long tradition of educational research suggests, the positive effect of parental education on student performance operates primarily indirectly through a number of mechanisms such as advantages on standardized tests like the SAT and greater likelihood of admission to more selective institutions. Net of these benefits, greater selectivity in who attends college among first-generation students, as opposed to those with college-educated parents, becomes visible (see Torche 2011) .\nStudents with married parents have, on average, higher GPAs. As SAT score increases, so does student GPA. All majors have significantly higher GPAs than the reference category of engineering.\n18 Students enrolled full-year and full-time have higher GPAs. Out-of-state students, who are typically from wealthier families or recruited for merit, also achieve greater GPAs. Although working part-time during the academic year has no adverse effects on GPA, full-time employment does. Students at private institutions have significantly higher GPAs; however, as selectivity increases, student GPA decreases. 19 These findings indicate that parental aid's negative effect is not due to family, student, or institution characteristics. It is possible, however, that parental aid's effects may not be the same for students from different social class backgrounds. I thus estimate a model with an interaction term that allows the effect of parental aid to vary by income. The interactive variable is significant, indicating some heterogeneity. Figure 1 illustrates this finding, depicting the relationship between parental aid and GPA at selected values of parental income, holding all other explanatory variables at the mean. Income values correspond to 10, 25, 50, 75, and 90 percent of the parental income distribution. As the graph demonstrates, the most notable differences are in GPAs of students with no aid, with the advantage going to students in the top half of the income distribution. For example, students whose parents make $90,000 annually and receive no aid have an average GPA of around 3.15, whereas students whose parents make $5,000 start below 3.05. However, as aid increases, the curves begin to converge. By $16,000 in aid, all students are pulled below the 3.00 marka critical threshold for many graduate programs and employers. Across values of parental income, the highest level of parental aid is associated with an average GPA of around 2.95."}, {"section_title": "American Sociological Review XX(X)", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "21", "text": "Patterns across the selected incomes, while slightly different, are highly consistent. The curve for the most privileged students is the steepest, but everyone experiences a significant reduction in GPA-particularly in the first $8,000 of aid. Regardless of class background, the toll parental aid takes on GPA is modest. Yet, any reduction in student GPA due to parental aid-which is typically offered with the best of intentions-is both surprising and important. Even small disparities in GPA are magnified in an increasingly competitive labor market and disadvantage graduates when their records are considered next to those without such deductions.\nAlternative funding. Next, I look at how alternative aid shapes the relationship between parental aid and GPA, net of explanatory variables. Table 3 presents regression coefficients for GPA on a relative measure of parental aid (Model 1). Here parental aid is divided by the total amount of funding, including grants and scholarships, loans, work-study, other forms of aid (e.g., veteran benefits), and funds earned through student employment.\nBecause parental aid largely determines how much alternative aid-particularly nonmerit-based aid-students receive, the absolute and relative measures are highly correlated (r = .828, p < .001) and have a similar effect. Model 1 indicates that as the Note: Model includes controls for student sociodemographics, parental SES, family structure, academic ability, student characteristics, and institution characteristics.\n14 American Sociological Review XX(X) proportion of funding derived from parents increases, student GPA decreases (b = \u221210.943, p < .001). Effects of other independent variables also remain much the same. In this model, institutional cost reaches significance. As with selectivity, it has a negative impact on GPA. Model 2 presents absolute measures of all funding forms in thousands of dollars (logged). The negative effect of parental aid persists (b = \u22123.637, p < .001). Here independent status positively affects GPA and reflects the fact that independent students receive less parental aid overall. Loans are the only other aid source to have a similar effect on student GPA (b = \u22123.949, p < .001), and the coefficients are not significantly different. On the other hand, as money for grants and scholarships increases, so does student GPA (b = 7.421, p < .001). Funds from work-study, other sources of aid, and student employment do not significantly affect student GPA.\nThese findings indicate that the negative effects of parental aid and loans do not extend to all forms of aid. In fact, funds from most aid sources are not associated with losses to GPA-and they may even benefit students. There is thus variation in the effect of a dollar depending on funding source. I return to this issue in the conclusion."}, {"section_title": "Supplemental analyses.", "text": "Cross-sectional data are limited in the extent to which they can distinguish effects of family funding processes from spurious effects of student characteristics. For example, it may be that the association between parental aid and student performance is due to greater academic talent and motivation among less privileged students who make it to college, in comparison to the less select pool of more privileged students who often receive more parental aid. It is also possible that by the final year of college, many students with little parental funding and low GPAs have simply dropped out, creating the appearance that lower levels of parental aid lead to higher student GPAs.\nTo address these possibilities and confirm patterns established in the B&B93 analyses, 22 I turn to the BPS96/01 panel data, which follow a group of students who started college in 1996, and estimate fixed-effects models in which GPA is regressed on parental aid. Here, I examine the effect of parental aid within the educational careers of individual students, effectively controlling for the potential impact of differences between students. I include all students, even those who do not persist in college to senior year, so as to avoid potentially excluding low achieving students who receive little parental aid.\nI use a dichotomous indicator of aidwhether parents paid any tuition and feesand student-reported GPA, because these measures are available across all three waves. 23, 24 The full model includes year and college major-a potentially time-varying factor that influences student GPA. I also incorporate a variable that marks respondents as transfer students if they left their original institution. This is a rough indicator of changing institutional context, because the panel data do not offer detailed measures of institution characteristics for all three time points.\nAs Table 4 indicates, when accounting for time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity there is still a significant, negative effect of parental aid-in this case, providing any help with tuition-on GPA. The effect is apparent at the bivariate level (b = \u221221.603, p < .001) and when controlling for time-varying factors (b = \u22124.990, p < .001). As expected, student GPA improves with time. Transferring is also associated with a higher GPA and may be due to moving to a less selective school or entering an institution that provides a better fit, motivating academic focus. In addition, most majors have a positive effect on GPA, as compared to engineering. These results provide strong evidence that selectivity processes are not driving the negative relationship between parental aid and GPA, and that this relationship is not an artifact of using the B&B93 dataset."}, {"section_title": "25", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Degree Completion", "text": "It is possible that parental aid works in the opposite direction or simply has no effect with regard to degree completion. As my focus is now on persistence, I turn to BPS90/94, the only large-scale, nationally representative dataset that follows a sample of first-year students and includes a continuous measure of parental aid. Table 5 provides coefficients from a logistic regression model of BA completion. I start with a bivariate model (Model 1) that indicates a significant, positive relationship between parental aid and BA completion within five years (b = .615, p < .001). In this case, class advantages likely magnify the benefits of parental aid. The challenge is to see if parental aid's positive effects remain when accounting for parental class background.\nAs Model 2 indicates, even net of sociodemographics and parental SES, parental aid significantly increases the likelihood of obtaining a bachelor's degree (b = .432, p < .001). Being female also raises one's chance of graduating, but being older reduces the odds. Blacks are less likely to graduate than Whites, and Asians are more likely. Here the effects of parental income are captured primarily by a significant negative coefficient for independent status, which is linked to both lower parental SES and lower levels of parental aid. Students whose parents have a college or advanced degree are significantly more likely to graduate than students whose parents have a high school degree or less.\nModel 3 adds controls for family structure, academic ability, student characteristics, and institution characteristics. Parental aid still significantly boosts the odds of graduating (b = .144, p < .01). Consistent with prior work, racial effects are not apparent when controlling for a full array of direct and indirect effects of parental SES (e.g., attending a more selective and higher cost institutionboth of which are associated with greater odds of obtaining a degree).\nIncreases in first-year GPA also raise the likelihood of persisting to graduation.\n26 Students with parents married to each other are significantly more likely to graduate. Most majors are at least as likely, or more likely, to obtain a BA than engineering majors. The only exception is students who are undecided as of year one. Students enrolled full-year and full-time are also more likely to graduate. Notably, student employment, at any level, does not influence the odds of graduating.\nFinally, being at a private institution-only when selectivity and institution cost are accounted for-is associated with a decrease in the likelihood of graduating. Unlike for GPA, effects of parental aid on degree completion do not vary by parental income or education. Figure 2 presents this relationship graphically, holding all explanatory variables at the mean. It is clear this is a case of diminishing returns: the greatest effects of parental aid come with the first several thousand dollars. In fact, students with no parental aid have a 56.4 percent predicted probability of graduating and students who receive $4,000 in aid have a 62 percent predicted probability-nearly a 6 percent increase. At this point, the benefits associated with additional aid increase only incrementally and begin to plateau around $12,000, where students have a 65.2 percent predicted probability of graduating. At $40,000, the predicted probability is 68.8 percent-a gain of around 3 percent for over three times the money.\nAlternative funding. Finally, I look at how alternative aid influences the relationship between parental aid and BA completion. Table  6 displays regression coefficients for a relative model of parental aid (Model 1) and an absolute model (Model 2) including all forms of funding separately in thousands of dollars logged. As in the GPA analyses, relative and absolute measures of parental aid are highly correlated (r = .887, p < .001). Both models include the explanatory variables discussed earlier.\nModel 1 demonstrates that when considering parental aid as a percentage of the total funding package, it has a significant and positive effect on graduating (b = .444, p < .01). In Model 2, using an absolute measure of parental aid, the positive effect is again visible (b = .164, p < .01). Work-study funds also have a significant and positive effect on BA completion that is not significantly different from that of parental aid (b = .487, p < .05). In contrast, student employment negatively affects graduation within five years (b = -.225, p < .01). All other aid forms show no effects on graduating.

"}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "Parents often assume that one of the best ways they can direct their money is toward their children's college education. However, we have little empirical knowledge of how parental funds shape student performance during college. Within sociology, this intellectual gap can be attributed to a legacy of research from status attainment, human capital, and cultural perspectives detailing the positive impact of parental investments on children's academic, occupational, and economic outcomes. An alternative framework derived from moral hazard theory suggests that parental investments may actually provide an educational disincentive for children by offloading costs of poor performance on to parents. In this article, I assessed effects of parental financial investments on two key student outcomes: GPA and bachelor's degree completion. The findings provide mixed support for the above perspectives. On the one hand, results from BA completion analyses are most compatible with a more-is-more approach, as expected within sociology of education. Although the pattern is one of diminishing returns, parental investments significantly increase students' likelihood of obtaining a BA, net of explanatory variables including first-year GPA and accounting for money provided by alternative funding sources-grants and scholarships, loans, work-study, other aid (e.g., veteran benefits), and student employment.\nResults from GPA analyses are surprising and run counter to general expectations of how parental investments should operate; they are, however, consistent with a more-is-less approach. As parental aid increases, student GPA decreases, even net of sociodemographics, parental SES, family structure, academic ability, student characteristics, and institution characteristics. Although the effect is not linear, and, ironically, the most harm comes from initial aid, increasing investments provide a gradual drag on student GPA. This pattern remains when accounting for alternative sources of funding. Supplemental analyses using fixedeffects models confirm that more is not more when it comes to college GPA; these analyses suggest that results are not driven by unique characteristics of students who reach college without any parental assistance.\nThe patterns presented here highlight the importance of separating parental social class from the provision of parental funds. Class advantages can obscure parental aid's negative effects on GPA while magnifying parental funds' positive influence on degree completion. This is a problem in much research on college financial aid, which uses indicators of parental SES but fails to include parental aid. In addition, the level of available resources is not always the same as the amount deployed. Some parents provide more than they can reasonably afford, while others intentionally hold back. Previous work thus misses one mechanism that may help to explain variation in educational outcomes within social class groups.\nSuch seemingly contradictory findings highlight the importance of examining multiple educational outcomes at once. Without looking at BA completion, the story is one in which parental investments are detrimental to student performance. Without looking at student GPA, parental investments appear entirely unproblematic. Instead, the situation is more complex. Reconciling this set of findings requires moving beyond either a more-ismore or a more-is-less framework.\nAlthough they come to diametric conclusions, sociological research on parental investments-particularly within status attainment and human capital traditions-shares basic assumptions with moral hazard theory. Both approaches suggest that students are able and willing to maximize the resources that parents provide. As utilitarian actors, students either use parental investments to increase their human capital and optimize their future socioeconomic status, or they strategically limit academic efforts to the extent that they can avoid personal responsibility for the economic costs of their behavior.\nNeither of these situations fit this study's findings. Students with parental funding are not performing at higher levels, which would suggest optimization of funds. Nor are they performing at such low levels that they risk academic probation or dropping outexpected results if students were to fully capitalize on a lack of financial responsibility. Instead, students with parental support are best described as staying out of serious academic trouble but dialing down their academic efforts."}, {"section_title": "Satisficing in Higher Education", "text": "Parental funding may be best understood as enabling satisficing behaviors among students. The concept of satisficing was first elaborated by Simon (1955 Simon ( , 1957 but has since expanded to the fields of social psychology, political sociology, social cognition, and organizational behavior, among others. Satisficing originates in the theory of bounded rationality. This theory relaxes the notion that humans are fully utilitarian actors who encounter life decisions as if on a buffet, where each item comes with full information and each choice is independent of the next. Instead, bounded rationality recognizes that individuals often operate with incomplete information about the consequences of their decisions and have conflicting desires. As a result, people tend to satisfice-that is, to meet the criteria for adequacy on multiple fronts, rather than optimize chances for a particular outcome.\nIn this case, initial investments create conditions for students to lessen their scholarly efforts. At a certain point, however, investments have a diminishing effect on GPA, as students may not be willing to risk leaving the institution or letting their grades drop so low as to encounter serious consequences. Parental funds may encourage partial satisfaction of opportunities for human capital acquisition by staying in school, and partial satisfaction of reduced financial responsibilities by reducing (but not abandoning) academic focus. Satisficing is a micro-level explanation of how college students respond to their parents' provision of resources. Satisficing does not, however, occur in a cultural or social vacuum. Characteristics of young adulthood, as opposed to childhood and adolescence, may enable satisficing behaviors among students. In fact, Rosenfeld (2007) has dubbed the young adulthood years, many of which are spent in college, as an \"age of independence\" in which youth have unprecedented social and geographic distance from their families of origin. Far from being the passive receptacles that much parental investment literature assumes, young adults have a great deal of power over how parental educational resources are used. Instead of optimizing parental resources in ways consistent with academic excellence, reduced monitoring and accountability to parents may free college students to pursue courses of action that may not reflect parental wishes.\nInstitutional context also matters. Colleges have long offered an alternative, primarily social, pathway to which students may devote their attentions (Armstrong and Hamilton 2013; Horowitz 1987 ). Higher education scholars have recently noted ways that student involvement in the social side of college life may shape academic achievement (Armstrong and Hamilton 2013; Arum and Roksa 2011; Stevens et al. 2008) . Parental funds provide the time, money, and proximity (i.e., living on or near campus) necessary to delve deeply into college peer cultures. Social integration has positive effects on persistence (Pascarella and Terenzini 2005) , but being too involved in campus social life may have potential negative effects on student performance. As Arum and Roksa (2011) argue, many of today's college students are \"academically adrift\"-that is, in college but focused on recreational rather than academic pursuits. Time-use studies support this conclusion. Today's college students spend an average of 28 hours a week on classes and homework combined-less time than an average high school student spends in school alone-but devote a full 41 hours a week to social and recreational purposes (Brint et al. 2010) .\nChanneling parental funds into social experiences is likely not the result desired by most parents. Unlike moral hazard, however, the concept of satisficing does not require parents' and students' interests to be at odds. In fact, qualitative research suggests that parents are also exposed to a cultural discourse of college as a fun, best years of your life, coming-of-age experience. Some parents may be onboard with an approach that values the social, even to the detriment of the academic, as long as their children manage to leave with a degree. A small percentage of such parents may draw on social ties and cultural capital to help compensate for deficits in their children's college performance (Hamilton 2010) . The impetus behind investments at this point in the educational trajectory may vary markedly from those that help children get to college.\nThese results indicate the importance of recognizing variation in effects of parental investments across educational contexts as well as across life stages. As Coleman (1988) suggests, parents' financial capital is necessary but not sufficient for children's development of human capital. Coleman focuses on the family relationships that mediate these investments, but the social, cultural, and institutional contexts in which they are deployed matter as well. Emerging cross-cultural scholarship on variation in social capital's effects has begun to push parental investment literature in this direction (e.g., Cheng, Martin, and Werum 2007) . To date, however, financial investments have been treated as largely immutable and their positive effects inevitable.\nDifferential effects across types of student aid highlight the fact that money is a social medium that gains meaning through exchange, rather than an impersonal, static resource (Zelizer 1994) . Parents are likely to find it difficult to hold students to seemingly impersonal performance standards or to create a sense of responsibility for the aid they provide. Loans may share similar qualities, especially if students assume parents will cover their payments. Other types of aid require students to do something (e.g., work, serve in the military, or perform well in high school) to receive funds, and many grants and scholarships have academic standards to motivate performance. These monies may come with a sense of having been earned rather than bestowed (even if temporarily so, in the case of loans).\nConsideration of the meaning carried by financial investments suggests not all parental aid will result in satisficing. This may be the average effect of such contributions, but we can imagine that parents who intentionally counter the assumption of a no-stringsattached gift may achieve quite different results. In addition, the propensity to satisfice likely varies with other aspects of students' personalities and identities. Some students may be unlikely to satisfice, regardless of how they are funded. Propensity to satisfice may be linked to variation in cultural understandings regarding the purpose of college and the central tasks of young adulthood.\nParental support for college, while not entirely determined by class, is the aid form most linked to privilege-rather than need or merit. Here we see that students receiving high levels of parental aid enjoy an advantage in college completion that, for many, likely outweighs the detrimental effects to GPA. Reliance on individual families for college funding thus likely advantages privileged students in terms of access and persistence. Indeed, research shows that the large class gap in college completion has grown as federal and state support for higher education has declined (Bailey and Dynarski 2011) . At this historical moment, disparities in the ability to fund a young-adult life stage may be one of the central mechanisms through which class inequalities are reproduced.\nFuture research will require far richer data on parent-child interactions in higher education. Existing financial information, including recent reports of the specific amounts parents spend on college (much less why, how, and for what) is quite limited. Other forms of educational investments that are standard fare in K to 12 research, such as frequency of conversations with children, are not even assessed in most national postsecondary datasets. Parenting may look different at this level of education, as it is sometimes accomplished primarily through wireless communications and financial transfers. However, as my findings demonstrate, parents play an active role in shaping young adults' educational experiences-perhaps in ways they do not intend."}, {"section_title": "Funding", "text": "This research was supported by a grant from the American Educational Research Association, which recieves funds for its AERA Grants Program from the National Science Foundation and the National Center for Education Statistics of the Institute of Education Sciences (U.S. Department of Education) under NSF Grant #DRL-0634035.

Self-reported GPA data are not ideal but are less problematic here than in cross-sectional data where GPA inflation varies with key explanatory factors across individuals. GPA is also not assessed consistently across waves. Students were asked to report on a 4.0 scale in 1996, but then asked if they have mostly A's, mostly A's and B's, and so on in 1998 and 2001. I used the metric that NCES uses to move between a categorical and numerical grade scale, and I assigned the GPA midpoints (multiplied by 100) across all three waves. Analyses for just 1998 and 2001 show the same significant pattern, and similar results are produced when 1996 data are converted to the categorical measure used in 1998 and 2001. If anything, because spaces between data points are much larger than when using a 4.0 scale, these results provide a conservative estimate of effects of parental aid. 25.
