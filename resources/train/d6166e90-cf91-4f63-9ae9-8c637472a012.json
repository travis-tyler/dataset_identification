Compared with noncarriers, APOE \u24404 carriers showed a greater decline in visual memory at the 18month assessment. No interaction between APOE \u24404 and cerebral A\u2424 load was observed for any measure of cognitive function.\nIn this prospective study of healthy older adults, high cerebral A\u2424 load was associated with greater decline in episodic and working memory over 18 months. The APOE \u24404 genotype was also associated with a decline in visual memory, although the effect was less than that observed for cerebral A\u2424 load.

[5] [6] [7] [8] Recent cross-sectional studies of healthy older adults reported moderate associations between cerebral A\u2424 burden and episodic memory when analyses were restricted to carriers of the APOE \u24404 allele. No such relationships were observed in noncarriers, 5, 6 suggesting that in healthy older adults, elevated cerebral A\u2424 load may be a more important prognostic factor in individuals genetically at risk for Alzheimer disease (AD). However, the implications of a high cerebral A\u2424 load for cognitive function should be determined in prospective studies. Further,"}, {"section_title": "", "text": "whereas it is well known that healthy older adults who carry the APOE \u24404 allele show accelerated cognitive decline, 9, 10 it is not clear whether this allele may also moderate the relation between cerebral A\u2424 level and cognitive decline.\nTwo prospective Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) PET neuroimaging studies have reported no differences between healthy older adults with high and low cerebral A\u2424 on the rate of cognitive change over 24 months. However, in both studies, the samples were small (n \u0545 30), and neither examined the effect of the APOE genotype. 8, 11 The aim of the current study was to examine associations between cerebral A\u2424 load, APOE genotype, and cognitive change over 18 months in a large group of healthy older adults. We hypothesized that increased cerebral A\u2424 load and APOE \u24404 genotype would be associated with episodic memory decline over 18 months. METHODS Participants. Participants were recruited from the healthy control group enrolled in the Australian Imaging Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) flagship study of aging. 3, 12 The process of recruitment and diagnostic classification of healthy older adults enrolled in the AIBL cohort has been described in detail elsewhere. 12 Healthy participants who volunteered were excluded from the AIBL study if they had any of the following: schizophrenia; depression (Geriatric Depression Score of 6 or greater); Parkinson disease; cancer (other than basal cell skin carcinoma) within the last 2 years; symptomatic stroke; uncontrolled diabetes; or current regular alcohol use exceeding 2 standard drinks per day for women or 4 per day for men. A clinical review panel chaired by D.A. reviewed all available med-ical, psychiatric, and neuropsychological information to confirm the cognitive health of individuals enrolled in the healthy control group. In this study, only the subgroup of healthy older adults who had undergone PiB neuroimaging and who had completed the cognitive battery at baseline and 18-month assessment (n \u03ed 141) were included. Demographic and clinical characteristics of the healthy control subjects are shown in table 1. The clinical status of all participants did not change at 18 months.\nStandard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient consents.

PiB PET neuroimaging and APOE \u24404", "text": "genotyping. PiB PET imaging methodology has been outlined in detail previously. 3, 13 PET standardized uptake value (SUV) data acquired 40 -70 minutes after PiB injection were summed and normalized to the cerebellar cortex SUV, resulting in a region/cerebellar ratio termed the standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR). An 80-mL blood sample was also taken from each participant, 0.5 mL of which was forwarded for APOE genotyping at a clinical pathology laboratory.\nCognitive assessments. All participants were assessed with the clinical rating scales and neuropsychological battery from the AIBL study (table 2) . These have all been described in detail elsewhere and were administered according to standard protocols by trained research assistants. 7, 12, 14 The clinical status of participants was determined by data that included the Mini-Mental State Examination 15 and Clinical Dementia Rating Scale. 16 Premorbid intelligence was estimated using the Wechsler Test of Adult Reading, 17 and levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. 18 Verbal learning and verbal episodic memory were measured using the California Verbal Learning Test, Second Edition (CVLT-II), 19 and visual episodic memory was measured using the visual Paired Associate Learning (PAL) task. 20 All individuals also performed a set of computerized cognitive tests, which included measures of visual learning (One Card Learning task [OCL]), working memory (One Back task [OBK]), attention Procedure. All healthy participants in this study underwent an extensive medical, psychiatric, and neuropsychological assessment upon enrollment into the AIBL study. The same assessments were repeated 18 months later. In this study, we report PiB neuroimaging and APOE \u24404 genotyping data obtained at baseline and neuropsychological data obtained at baseline and 18 months to examine the rate of cognitive change in relation to cerebral A\u2424 load and APOE \u24404 status.\nData analysis. Each cognitive task provided a single performance score (table 2) . A Working Memory-Learning Composite (OCL-OBK) score was generated by standardizing the OCL and OBK scores and then averaging them. A Psychomotor-Attention Composite (DET-IDN) score was generated by standardizing the DET and IDN scores and then averaging them. Consistent with observations from other studies, 5,8 the distribution of PiB SUVR data was skewed negatively and could not be normalized with data transformations. Thus, SUVR was classified dichotomously as either low (SUVR \u03fd1.50) or high (SUVR \u05461.50) in accordance with established criteria. 8, 23 There were no statistically significant differences between SUVR and APOE groups for any of the demographic characteristics (table 1) . A series of linear mixed-model (LMM) analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) was conducted to examine the relationship between SUVR status (SUVR \u03fd1.5 vs SUVR \u05461.5), APOE \u24404 status (APOE \u24404 carrier vs APOE \u24404 noncarrier), and cognitive change between baseline and 18-month assessment. The LMM procedure was used because of its ability to model both fixed and random effects, which accounts for various sources of variability, and because it provides improved estimates of withinsubject coefficients (i.e., random effects) in longitudinal studies. 24, 25 For each task, an LMM ANCOVA with SUVR status, APOE \u24404 status, and the SUVR \u03eb APOE \u24404 status interaction were entered as fixed factors, participant as a random factor, baseline cognitive test score as the only covariate, and cognitive test score at the 18-month assessment as a dependent variable. For each performance measure, the magnitude of the difference in adjusted means between low and high SUVR groups and between APOE \u24404 carrier and noncarrier groups at the 18-month assessment was expressed using the Cohen d. 26 To assist with interpretation of the LMM, group mean and SD change scores for each SUVR and APOE group, as well as for SUVR high and low groups averaged over APOE \u24404 status and APOE \u24404 carriers and noncarriers averaged over SUVR status, were calculated. Although estimates of premorbid intelligence were not different between the study groups (table 1) , analyses were recomputed with age and premorbid intelligence included as covariates to examine the extent to which cognitive reserve may affect the relationship between cerebral A\u2424 level, genotype, and change in cognition. 27 "}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": "Of the total sample, there was one noncompletion for DET and PAL, 2 noncompletions for OCL, and 2 noncompletions for OBK at the 18month assessment. Complete baseline and 18-month data were available for all other tasks. LMM analyses indicated that, relative to older adults with SUVR \u03fd1.5 at baseline, older adults with SUVR \u05461.5 showed significantly greater decline at the 18-month assessment on all measures of verbal and visual episodic memory as well as working memory (table 3) . No decline at the 18-month assessment was observed for measures of psychomotor or attentional function in either SUVR group. The magnitudes of the differences in baseline-adjusted performance between the low and high SUVR groups at the 18-month assessment are shown in the figure. Inspection of group mean raw change scores also indicate that when averaged across APOE \u24404 status, individuals in the high SUVR group showed greater decline on tasks of ver- bal and visual episodic memory, as well as working memory, at the 18-month assessment (table 4) . When APOE \u24404 status was added to the LMM analyses, no statistically significant interaction between SUVR status and APOE \u24404 status was observed for any cognitive measure. However, when considered by itself, the presence of the APOE \u24404 allele was associated with a greater decline in visual memory after 18 months. Magnitudes of differences in baseline-adjusted performance between APOE \u24404 carriers and noncarriers at the 18-month assessment are shown in the figure (light green bars). The greater decline in performance on memory scores in the APOE \u24404 carriers, averaged over SUVR groups, is also shown in table 4.\nReanalysis of the data with age and premorbid intelligence included as covariates did not change the pattern of results. No interactions between SUVR and APOE \u24404 status were observed (all p \u03fe 0.5). However, statistically significant main effects of SUVR were observed for the OCL, OBK, PAL, CVLT-II Total and Delayed Recall, and OCL-OBK (all p \u03fd 0.05). Statistically significant main effects of APOE \u24404 status were observed for the OCL ( p \u03fd 0.05)."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "Results of this study support the hypothesis that in healthy older adults high cerebral A\u2424 load is associated with a decline in episodic memory over 18 months. Compared with the cognitive performance of healthy older adults with normal cerebral A\u2424 load, older adults with high cerebral A\u2424 load showed greater decline across each aspect of episodic memory assessed and the magnitudes of these were by convention moderate 26 (i.e., Cohen d \u03ed 0.40\u03ea 0.60). A decline of comparable magnitude was observed for visual working memory (figure). Because the 95% confidence intervals for these different effect sizes showed substantial overlap, the current data are interpreted most parsimoniously as showing that high cerebral A\u2424 load gave rise to equivalent decline across all aspects of episodic and working memory. In contrast to memory, no effect of cerebral A\u2424 load was observed for psychomotor function or visual attention. Hence, the decline in episodic memory observed could not have been due to changes in arousal or attention.\nConsistent with previous reports, 1,4,11,28 we observed no differences between the low and high cerebral A\u2424 load groups or between APOE \u24404 carriers and noncarriers, in performance on any of the cognitive tests at the time of neuroimaging (table 2) . Healthy older adults with low and high cerebral A\u2424 load who were APOE \u24404 carriers and noncarriers were also equivalent on each demographic characteristic (table 1) . Furthermore, when the healthy adults were considered as a single group, no decline from the baseline to the 18-month assessment was observed in any aspect of cognition (table 2) , and review at 18 months confirmed that their clinical status had not changed. The relatively high estimated premorbid intelligence of the control group in the AIBL cohort has been noted previously, 12 and this was also evident in the current subsample. It has been suggested the high premorbid intelligence could protect against cerebral amyloid-related cognitive decline. 27 However, in the current sample, there was no difference between high and low SUVR groups in estimated premorbid intelligence. Furthermore, the effects of cerebral A\u2424 load and APOE \u24404 on decline in episodic and working memory did not change when age and estimated premorbid intelligence were controlled for statistically in the analyses. These aspects of the results support the conclusion that the decline in memory and working memory observed after 18 months in healthy older adults was related specifically to high cerebral A\u2424 load. The decline in episodic and working memory associated with high cerebral A\u2424 load was not moderated at all by the APOE \u24404 status of the healthy older adults. However, when considered by itself, the APOE \u24404 allele was associated with statistically significant decline over 18 months in visual memory, although the magnitude of this decline was slightly less than that related to differences in cerebral A\u2424 load. Inspection of the magnitudes of differences between APOE \u24404 carrier and noncarrier groups for the other cognitive functions indicated moderate 26 (i.e., Cohen d \u03ed 0.24 -0.38) but nonsignificant decline for visual episodic memory, for verbal learning, and for the OCL-OBK ( figure) . This consistency suggests that these effect sizes did reflect true differences in the level of cognitive decline between APOE \u24404 carriers and noncarriers, although the magnitudes of these differences were not sufficient to be rendered statistically significant in the current study. The presence of an APOE \u24404 allele-related decline in memory in healthy older adults is consistent with previous observations, 9, 10 although the more subtle effect of APOE \u24404 positivity observed here could reflect the fact that the current sample was younger than some samples studied recently 10 and studied over a shorter interval than that in the benchmark study of this issue. 9 Thus, although these data do suggest that both cerebral A\u2424 load and APOE \u24404 status predict decline in episodic memory over 18 months, the magnitude of the effect of cerebral A\u2424 load was greater than that of APOE \u24404 status. More important, though, LMM analyses and inspection of the group mean change scores (table 4) suggest strongly that the presence of the APOE \u24404 allele did not moderate cerebral A\u2424related decline in memory in healthy older adults.\nTwo small prospective studies have investigated the extent to which cerebral A\u2424 load, measured using PiB PET neuroimaging, is related to change in cognitive function in healthy older adults. 8, 11 As in the current study, the entire group of healthy older adults from the Melbourne Healthy Aging Study cohort showed no change in memory or nonmemory composite scores 18 or 36 months after a baseline PiB PET scan. However, when adults in this group were classified as having high or low cerebral A\u2424 load, using the same criterion as that used in the current study, healthy older adults with high cerebral A\u2424 load showed statistically significant decline of a moderate magnitude on both memory and nonmemory composite scores 36 months after PET scanning. 8 However, by the 36-month assessment, 25% of healthy older adults with high cerebral A\u2424 load met the clinical criteria for mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Thus, the general decline in cognition observed at 36 months postscan reflected this change in clinical status. Conversely, in a subset of healthy control subjects recruited from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), individuals with low or high cerebral A\u2424 load did not differ in the rate at which their global cognitive ability and verbal episodic memory deteriorated over 15 months. Given the magnitudes of the effects observed here, the sample studied in the ADNI cohort was probably too small to allow for the detection of any subtle decline in memory. 11 Taken together, the results from these 2 previous prospective studies and the current study suggest that in healthy older adults, high cerebral A\u2424 does increase the risk of progression to MCI and that the subtle decline in memory that characterizes such progression can be detected over relatively short time intervals (i.e., 18 months), even in the absence of any change in clinical status. Our results are consistent with prospective studies of healthy older adults with increased cerebral amyloid determined from analysis of CSF. 29, 30 These studies also report that pathologic levels of CSF A\u242442 are associated with increased rates of cognitive decline, although like the neuroimaging studies, these changes were observed over much longer intervals than those observed here (e.g., 4\u03ea10 years). 29, 30 In the current cohort of individuals with high cerebral A\u2424, we expect that the decline in memory will continue until it reaches levels that would be considered as reflecting cognitive impairment (compared with normative data) and the clinical status of individuals changes from cognitively normal to indicative of MCI. The finding that cerebral A\u2424-related decline in memory can occur without a change in clinical status also raises an important issue about the methods for classifying levels of cognitive function in healthy older adults. Our group has suggested that the earliest stages of AD may be most accurately detected through objective evidence for decline in cognitive function, in particular memory function, rather than from the detection of impairment in cognition. [31] [32] [33] Recent recommendations for the definition of the preclinical stage of AD have also recommended that the identification of objectively defined cognitive decline may assist in the detection of preclinical AD. 34, 35 Thus, the combination of objectively defined cognitive decline with putative AD biomarkers should considerably strengthen the ability to detect preclinical AD. 34 Although these are the first studies to investigate the extent to which amyloid imaging biomarkers predict future cognitive decline, previous research has sought to determine the extent to which decline in cognitive function predicts an increase in cerebral A\u2424 load. For example, in a series of studies of healthy adults followed prospectively with brief batteries of cognitive tests, we identified that statistically reliable decline in aspects of verbal and visual episodic memory tests over 6 years 13 2 years, 36 and even 1 year 37 was associated with increased risk of high cerebral A\u2424 load. Other studies have observed similar declines in cognition in individuals with high cerebral A\u2424 load. 28, 38 When considered with the results of the current study, these data suggest that the combination of decline in memory with parameters from amyloid imaging may be useful for the identification of the AD process in individuals who do not meet any clinical criteria for cognitive impairment. In healthy older adults with high cerebral A\u2424 load, an objectively defined decline in memory may also be a worthy target for anti-amyloid therapies. 39 An important methodologic issue needs to be considered when interpreting the current results be- cause an extensive investigation of cognitive function was not conducted. The tasks used were chosen based on brevity, test-retest reliability, demonstrated sensitivity to change, and ability to be applied repeatedly without the generation of practice effects. 21, 40 Exploration using more detailed neuropsychological tests will be useful in further elucidating the nature of cerebral A\u2424-related decline in cognition."}]
