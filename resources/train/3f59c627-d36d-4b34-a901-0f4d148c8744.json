[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "To this end, this report analyzes new, nationally representative data from the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009 (HSLS:09). Part I of this report examines what high schools are doing to help students transition to postsecondary education. Broadly, it examines college-level course offerings; counselors' time, attitudes and actions; and students' interactions with counselors. Each outcome was analyzed by the following high school characteristics: high school type (public or private), fouryear college-going rate, size, locale, Hispanic students' representation, black students' representation, and the percentage of 1 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).

It is important to keep in mind that these higher college-going rates could be driving counselors' behavior as much as their counselors' behavior are driving these higher college-going rates. 6 While chi-squared tests were used to determine which high school characteristics to present, when comparisons between two specific estimates were made in the text, t-tests were used to check whether that difference is statistically significant at the .05 level. Perhaps never before in our nation's history has helping Americans successfully transition into and complete postsecondary credentials been more important. Increasing Americans' educational attainment is critical for our country's economic competitiveness. The United States is now 16th out of 36 developed countries in the percentage of workers age 25 through 34 who hold a postsecondary credential. 1 Improving postsecondary educational attainment is also essential for helping citizens individually. Compared to Americans with high school diplomas, Americans with bachelor's or advanced college degrees are half as likely to be unemployed and earn 66 percent more in lifetime earnings. 2 In recent years, both the obama administration and prominent foundations like the Lumina Foundation and Gates Foundation have recognized the importance of improving college degree attainment rates, both for the nation and for individuals' well-being, and have set goals to increase the proportion of Americans with postsecondary credentials. 3 To help meet these objectives, it is essential that we facilitate students' transition from high school to postsecondary education. students at public high schools receiving free or reduced-price lunch (as a proxy for low-income students' representation). 4 Chi-squared tests were used to determine where differences were statistically significant at the .05 level. Significant differences most commonly occurred between public and private high schools and among three categories of four-year college-going rates 5 ; therefore, this study consistently presents results by these high school characteristics. other high school characteristics are reported only when statistically significant differences emerged. 6 Part II of this report helps identify what schools can do to get students on a path that should lead to their successfully transition to college. To that end, this section examines how counseling characteristics are related to ninth-graders' perceptions about college affordability, intention to enroll in a bachelor's degree program within a year of completing high school, and plans to take the SAT or ACT. In this section, descriptive statistics are presented first, followed by a discussion of regression results that control for high school, student and parent characteristics. The role of counseling characteristics on first-generation college students' attitudes and plans receives special attention."}, {"section_title": "COLLEgE-LEvEL COuRSES", "text": "\u2022 in 2009, 86 percent of high schools provided opportunities for students to participate in dual enrollment, and two-thirds had Advanced Placement (AP) classes on site, but only about three percent offered an International Baccalaureate (IB) program. Public schools were more likely than private schools to offer dual enrollment. Schools with a larger number of students were more likely than other schools to provide AP classes or an IB program."}, {"section_title": "COunSELORS' TIME", "text": "\u2022 Student-to-Counselor Ratios: Fifty percent of all high schools had student-to-counselor ratios of more than 250 to 1. Counselors at public high schools had a larger median caseload (299 students) than counselors at private high schools (106). Schools with more students were also more likely to have higher student-to-counselor ratios. \u2022 Time Spent on College Counseling: About half of all high school counselors spent 21 percent or more of their time assisting students with college readiness, selection and applications. Not surprisingly, schools with higher four-year college-going rates were more likely than those whose rates were lower to spend a greater proportion of their time on college counseling.\nWhile college-level courses taken during high school can help students prepare for college academics, counselors are critical in helping them navigate the logistics of the transition from high school to college. This section of the report therefore investigates various measures of student access to counselors, both for general academic and personal counseling and for college counseling specifically. figure 4 shows that half of all high schools reported a student-tocounselor ratio of 250 or fewer to 1. However, public and private high schools differed markedly on this measure. only 39 percent of public high schools reported this relatively low ratio compared to 89 percent of private high schools-a 50 percentage-point spread. In addition, 20 percent of public high schools reported counselor caseloads of 351-450, and another 15 percent reported caseloads of more than 450. only one percent of private high schools fell into each of these two high caseload categories. This difference by school type is also reflected in the overall median caseload: 299 students at public high schools compared to 106 at private high schools. 15 Student-to-counselor ratios also differed by the four-year collegegoing rate of the high school. figure 5 clearly demonstrates that schools with low and high college-going rates were more likely than schools with middle-level rates to have caseloads of 250 or fewer students per counselor. Schools in the low and high categories had median caseloads of 261 and 234, respectively, both of which were significantly lower than the middle category's caseload of 323. Because school size reflects the number of students at the school, it is not surprising that it is significantly related to counselor caseloads. As shown in Figure 6, as school size grows the percentage of schools with the lowest student-to-counselor ratio (0 to 250) declines, while the percentage of schools with the highest ratio (450 or more) generally increases. Likewise, the median counselor caseload rises monotonically as school size increases, with caseloads of 183, 293, 346, 391, and 423, respectively, across categories. notably, 37 percent of counselors at schools with more than 2,000 students were responsible for more than 450 students. Before moving on, it is worth noting that HSLS asked counselors whether their school had one or more counselors whose primary responsibility was assisting students with college readiness, selection and applications. Sixty-three percent responded affirmatively. Interestingly, this percentage did not differ significantly by high school type or four-year college-going rate (appendix table 4) or any of the other high school characteristics examined. figure 7 shows the percentage of time that counseling staff spend on various counseling activities. It not only highlights the variety of demands on counselors, but also indicates that college readiness counseling generally takes up a larger proportion of counselors' time than many other activities. 16 About 13 percent of counselors spent more than half of their time and 38 percent spent between one-fifth and half of their time counseling students on college readiness, selection and applications. Still, 20 percent of all counselors spent no more than a tenth of their time and 30 percent spent between a tenth and a fifth of their time helping students prepare for college in this way. The distribution of time spent on college counseling differed by fouryear college-going rate but not by high school type (Appendix Table  5) or the other high school characteristics examined. as figure 8 shows, schools with high college-going rates were significantly more likely than other schools to have counseling staffs who spent more than 50 percent of their time on college counseling: 17 percent compared to two percent and four percent of schools with low and middle-level college-going rates, respectively. The percentage of high schools with counselors spending 21 to 50 percent of their time on college preparation activities also increases monotonically as fouryear college-going rate grows: schools with a high college-going rate were 33 percentage points more likely to spend this amount of counseling time than high schools with a low college-going rate. A sizeable three-quarters of schools with the lowest college-going rate spent only 20 percent or less of their time on college counseling activities."}, {"section_title": "COunSELORS' ATTITuDES", "text": "\u2022 Emphasis on Postsecondary Preparation: Forty-eight percent of counselors asserted that helping students \"prepare for postsecondary schooling\" was their counseling program's primary goal. Counselors chose this goal more often than any of the three other options from which they could choose, which included helping students \"improve their achievement in high school\" (23 percent); \"with their personal growth and development\" (21 percent); and \"prepare for work goals after high school\" (seven percent). Schools with higher four-year college-going rates and schools spending a larger proportion of their time on college counseling were more likely to indicate that preparing students for postsecondary schooling was their primary goal. \u2022 Giving Up on Students: Thirteen percent of counselors agreed that \"counselors in this school have given up on some students.\" Schools with higher four-year college-going rates were more likely than those with lower rates to strongly disagree with this statement.\nCounselor attitudes may also shape the college counseling that schools provide. In this study, attitudes were measured in a couple of ways. First, counselors were asked to rank their counseling program's most emphasized goals. Figure 9 reveals that nearly half (48 percent) of counselors chose helping students \"prepare for postsecondary school\" as their first goal. In comparison, a little less than a quarter (23 percent and 21 percent, respectively) selected help students \"improve their achievement in high school\" and help students \"with their personal growth and development.\" only seven percent chose help students \"prepare for work roles after school as their first goal.\" 17 Thirty-one percent of counselors ranked preparing students for postsecondary education as their second goal, and 18 percent chose it as their third goal. The priority that counseling staff placed on postsecondary preparation did not differ by high school type (appendix table 5) 18 or the other school characteristics examined, but it did differ by fouryear college-going rate ( Figure 10). The percentage of counselors indicating that postsecondary preparation was their program's first goal rose from 32 percent, to 52 percent, to 72 percent, as their college-going rate increased. This study also examined whether the percentage of counselors who indicated that preparing students for postsecondary education was a top priority differed significantly by other counseling program characteristics. Both counselor caseload and having a dedicated college counselor were not significantly related to whether counselors considered students' preparation for college a top priority, but time spent on college counseling was related. Figure 11 reveals that among counselors in programs that spent 20 percent or less of their time on college counseling, just 35 percent viewed preparing students for postsecondary education as their first goal. In contrast, among counselors in programs that spent more than 20 percent of their time on college counseling, 61 percent felt this activity was their top priority. Thus, it does seem that counselor priorities and the time counselors spend on counseling students are somewhat aligned. Counselors were also asked about the attitudes of counselors at their school, rating them on a scale of \"strongly disagree,\" \"disagree,\" \"agree,\" and \"strongly agree.\" 19 figure 12 shows that almost all (97 percent or more) counselors agreed or strongly agreed that counselors at their school \"set high standards for students' learning,\" \"believe all students can do well\" and \"work hard to make sure all students learn.\" Similarly, very few respondents indicated that counselors agreed with the more negatively worded statements \"care only about smart students\" or \"expect very little from students\" (two percent or less). A slightly more mixed response occurred on one item. Thirteen percent of responding counselors agreed that counselors in their school \"have given up on some students.\" The distribution of responses to this statement did not differ by high school type (Appendix table 5) or the other high school characteristics examined, but did differ by four-year college-going rate. As figure 13 reveals, schools with high college-going rates were 27 percentage points more likely than schools with low rates to strongly disagree with the idea that counselors had given up on students (60 percent vs. 33 percent)."}, {"section_title": "COunSELORS' ACTIOnS", "text": "\u2022 Career and Education Plans: Eighty percent of all high schools required that students have a career and/or education plan. Among these schools, 87 percent shared these plans with parents, and among schools that create and share plans with parents, 44 percent required a parent's signature on the plan. Public schools were more likely than private schools to establish these student plans. Schools with higher four-year college-going rates were more likely than other schools to insist on a parent's signature. \u2022 College Counseling Activities: When provided with a range of college counseling activities, counselors were most likely to report assisting students with obtaining financial aid for college (93 percent), consulting with postsecondary representatives about requirements and qualifications (92 percent), holding or participating in college fairs (86 percent), and holding a session on the transition to college for students or parents (83 percent). other activities were less common. About two-thirds of counselors indicated that they organize visits to colleges or have a program in place that encourages students not considering college to attend. Nevertheless, this first action was significantly more likely to occur in schools where the percentage of black students exceeded 50 percent, and this second action was significantly more likely to occur in schools where the percentage of Hispanic students did. overall, about one-third of schools enrolled students in special college-prep programs like Upward Bound. However, participation in such programs was significantly greater in schools with higher percentages of black or Hispanic students, and in public schools with a high percentage of low-income students.\nCounselors can perform certain actions to facilitate students' transition between high school and college. one such action involves ensuring that students have a career or education plan. figure 14 shows that about 80 percent of all schools required students to have a career or education plan; 87 percent of schools whose students had plans shared these plans with parents; and among the schools that shared these plans with parents, 44 percent required parents to sign them. Differences by high school type only occurred on the first outcome (create a plan). Public schools tended to require students to have career and education plans more often than private high schools (85 percent vs. 63 percent). differences by four-year college-going rate only occurred on the last outcome (parent signature on a plan). as figure 15 illustrates, among schools that have plans and share them with parents, the percentage of schools requiring parents to sign off increases from 37 percent in schools with low college-going rates to 67 percent in schools with high college-going rates. Counseling staff also can take actions that are even more directly related to preparing students for the transition to college. Figure 16 displays the options presented to counselors in the HSLS survey. Three general tiers emerge. The least common thing school action was to offer a college prep program like Upward Bound, Gear Up, AVID, or MeSa. Just 38 percent of schools did so. organizing visits to college and having a formal program that encourages students not considering college to do so were more common, with around two-thirds of all counselors responding affirmatively. Holding sessions on transition to college and holding or participating in college fairs were the next most common types of activities (at 83 percent and 86 percent, respectively), followed closely by consulting with postsecondary representatives about requirements and assisting students with finding financial aid for college (92 percent and 93 percent, respectively). Schools' likelihood of participating in these actions differed somewhat by high school characteristics. Public high schools were significantly more likely than private high schools to enroll students in a college prep program like Upward Bound and to assist students with finding financial aid for college. Involvement in college prep programs like Upward Bound also differed by four-year college-going rate, declining monotonically as the rate increased (figure 17). in addition, the percentage of schools holding or participating in college fairs differed by the four-year college-going rate. Ninety-seven percent of schools with middle college-going rates participated compared with 76 percent of schools with low rates. School size also was related to some college counseling actions, with significant differences detected on offering a college prep program, having a formal program to encourage students not considering college to do so, offering an information session on the transition to college for students and parents, and holding or participating in college fairs (figure 18). generally, schools with 500 or fewer students appeared to be less likely to take these steps. In addition, on two measures, offering an information session and holding or participating in college fairs, no significant differences were detected between schools with more than 500 students. this suggests that once schools pass a certain size threshold, having a greater numbers of students does not change their likelihood of providing these events. one particular counselor action, offering a college prep program like Upward Bound, differed significantly by the socioeconomic and racial/ethnic composition of schools. This result should not be surprising given that these programs target low-income and firstgeneration college students. 20 Focusing on public schools where 60 percent or more students received free or reduced-price lunch, 65 percent enrolled students in these types of college prep programs (Appendix Table 3). In contrast, among public schools where less than 20 percent of students received free or reduced-price lunch, only 28 percent of schools did so. 21 Differences in participation were also large depending on the percentage of Hispanic and black students in schools. Figure 19 reveals that 36 percent of schools with lower concentrations of Hispanic students enrolled students in these programs compared to 63 percent of schools with higher Hispanic student concentrations. Likewise, as Figure 20 illustrates, schools with higher proportions of black students were more than twice as likely as other schools to participate in such programs. A few additional counselor actions were related to the racial/ethnic composition of schools as well, though the differences were not quite as stark. First, schools with high percentages of Hispanic students and schools with a high percentage of black students were both more likely to assist students with finding financial aid for college. Second, schools with a large percentage of Hispanic students were more likely to have a formal program to encourage students not considering college to do so. Finally, schools with a higher black student population were more likely to organize student visits to college than schools with smaller black populations."}, {"section_title": "STuDEnTS' InTERACTIOnS WITh COunSELORS", "text": "\u2022 only 18 percent of ninth-grade students had spoken with a counselor about college-a lower proportion than had spoken with a teacher, friends, mother, or father. This percentage did not differ by type of school or its four-year college-going rate. Nevertheless, students attending schools where more than 50 percent of the student body is black were more likely than other students to have spoken to a counselor.\nPart I of this report closes with ninth graders' self-reports of interactions with school counselors. about 18 percent of students reported that they had spoken with their counselor about college, a smaller percentage than the percentage who had spoken with their teacher, friends, father, or mother ( Figure 21). The percentage of ninth graders who had spoken with their counselors about college did not differ significantly by high school type or four-year collegegoing rate but did differ by black students' representation ( Figure  22). Students in schools with a lower percentage of black students were less likely than students in schools with a higher percentage of black students to have met with their counselor about college. Counseling Characteristics' Role in Ninth Graders' College Attitudes and Plans Having provided a portrait of what high schools are doing in terms of academic programs and counseling to help students transition to college, this section of the report addresses whether counseling characteristics are related to ninth graders forming positive college attitudes, aspirations and plans for college. This part of the analysis focuses on three indicators, whether students reported disagreeing with the statement, \"Even if you study, your family cannot afford to pay for you to attend college\"; asserting that they plan to enroll in a bachelor's degree program in the first year after high school; and indicating that they have taken or plan to take the SAT or ACT (if they reported that they planned to enroll in a bachelor's degree program in the first year after high school). The literature indicates that parents are extremely influential in students' attitudes, aspirations, and college plans. 22 Furthermore, students with parents who have bachelor's or advanced degrees are significantly more likely than other students to enroll in college even when matched by student ability. 23 High schools' counseling programs may therefore have less of an impact on students who are already highly likely to enroll given their parents' high levels of education. In contrast, students with parents who do not have a bachelor's degree are more in need of help from schools, as their parents often do not know as much about college admission and financial aid and cannot provide the same support. 24 For these reasons, our analysis proceeds as follows. First, Table 1 presents descriptive statistics on whether the key college counseling and high school characteristics examined in the previous section of the report, (and student and parent characteristics previous research has found to be relevant), are related to these three student outcomes of interest. Second, Table 2 (models 1a, 2a and 3a) contains regressions that examine which characteristics are significant for the entire student population after controlling for other variables. Third, Table 2 (models 1b, 2b and 3b) provides regressions on whether different variables are significantly related to outcomes when the population analyzed is limited to students whose parents do not have a bachelor's degree. This is the population for which the US Department of Education targets its TRIo programs. TRIo programs consider these students \"first-generation college students\" and they are referred to as such in this report. 25 finally, in tables 3, 4 and 5, the focus is on the final reduced models that include all the characteristics that were significantly related to these outcomes for first-generation college students. Because the outcomes studied here are categorical in nature, the analyses presented in tables 2-5 use logistic regression models. Rather than providing the coefficient estimates from these analyses, these tables provide odds ratios to describe the impact of various characteristics on the three outcomes of interest. 26 This discussion focuses on findings that are significant at the .05 level. Table 1 shows that the time counseling staff spent on college counseling activities and the priority counseling staff placed on college counseling were both significantly related to students' perception of college affordability (i.e., they disagreed that their family could not afford to pay for college). And, while it cannot be determined who initiated the discussion, parents' reporting that a family member interacted with a counselor or teacher at the school about postsecondary admission requirements was also positively associated with students' belief that college is affordable for their family. Moving on to school characteristics, high school type, four-year college-going rate and concentration of Hispanic students were all associated with students' perception of college affordability, as were the following student characteristics: math test score, 27 sex and race/ethnicity. Finally, in keeping with the literature, parents' educational attainment and educational expectations for their child were also related to students' belief that college was affordable."}, {"section_title": "COunSELIng ChARACTERISTICS' ROLE In nInTh gRADERS' COLLEgE ATTITuDES AnD PLAnS", "text": "\u2022 Controlling for an array of factors, the percentage of time that counselors spent on college readiness activities was positively related to first-generation college students' belief that their family can afford college. \u2022 a family member talking to a counselor (or teacher) about postsecondary admission requirements was positively related to firstgeneration college students' plans to enroll in a bachelor's degree program, even after controlling for multiple other characteristics. \u2022 Controlling for other factors, first-generation college students' speaking to a counselor about college was positively related to their intending to enroll in a bachelor's degree program and taking or planning to take the SAT or ACT."}, {"section_title": "Executive Summary", "text": "COLLEgE-LEvEL COuRSE OFFERIngS one way in which high schools prepare their students for the academic transition to college is to offer college-level courses. There are three ways that high schools usually offer such classes: an International Baccalaureate (IB) program, 7 Advanced Placement (AP) 8 courses or a dual enrollment program. 9 As Figure 1 shows, IB programs were still relatively rare in 2009, offered at just three percent of all high schools. In contrast, AP offerings were much more common, with more than two-thirds of high schools indicating that they offered AP courses on site. 10 Dual enrollment, however, was the most commonly available program: 86 percent of counselors stated that their high school \"provides opportunities to participate in concurrent or dual enrollment.\" While it is not known how easy it is for students to pursue dual enrollment, this method seems to be schools' most prevalent way of providing college-level courses. This result may not be surprising because enabling students to take college courses elsewhere is probably the least costly alternative. It does not necessitate finding high school staff to teach a collegelevel course or identifying a sufficient number of students to enroll the way an IB program or on-site AP courses might. In addition, unlike AP and IB courses, which are generally geared toward advanced students, dual enrollment courses can be effective for students with a wide range of academic preparation. 11 These college-level course offerings do differ by high school characteristics. Examining high school type first, Figure 1 reveals that though relatively small percentages of both public and private high schools 12 offered IB programs, public high schools were significantly more likely to do so. The percentage of schools offering AP courses on site did not differ significantly by high school type, but in the case of dual enrollment, 91 percent of public high schools provided dual enrollment compared to 66 percent of private high schools. Not surprisingly, high schools' likelihood of offering college-level courses was associated with the rate at which graduating seniors matriculated at four-year, bachelor's degree-granting colleges in the previous school year. Throughout this report, three categories are used to describe this four-year college-going rate: low, middle, and high, which signify rates of 0-33, 34-67, and 68-100 percent, respectively. Figure 2 depicts that all three types of college-level offerings were most commonly provided at the middle category of high schools. That is, schools in which one-third to two-thirds of their graduates enroll in a four-year college offered college-level courses more often than schools with lower and higher college-going rates. for example, 86 percent of such schools offered aP courses compared to just 46 percent of schools with low college-going rates and 71 percent with high college-going rates. ninety-six percent of schools in the middle category offered dual enrollment compared to 69 percent in the high category. 13 High Schools' College-Level offerings and Counseling Characteristics 7 Schools that participate in IB programs provide students with at least six college-level courses taught by high school faculty. Students receive college credit by passing subject exams administered to IB students worldwide. See: \"What is the IB Diploma Programme?\" A guide to the International Baccalaureate\u00ae (IB) Diploma Programme for universities and Colleges. The International Baccalaureate Organization. Retrieved August 14, 2012, from http://www.ibo.org/diploma/ recognition/guide/slideb.cfm. 8 unlike IB programs where schools must commit to offering at least six college-level courses, schools can choose to administer as few or as many of the 34 AP courses available as they like. high school teachers provide the instruction and students earn college credit by passing the exam administered to all AP students for that subject. See: \"AP: About.\" The College Board. Retrieved August 14, 2012, from http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/ap/about.html. 9 While IB and AP courses are generally taught at high schools and are designed for high school students, dual enrollment courses are generally taught at colleges and are designed for college students. high school students typically enroll in these college courses along with other college students. See: Karp, M., Calcagno, J., hughes, K., Jeong, D., and Bailey, T. "}, {"section_title": "Part I:", "text": "In general, the likelihood of providing IB and AP course offerings increased with the size of the school (Figure 3). For example, while a relatively small percentage of schools offered IB programs, the likelihood of doing so increased from two percent at schools with enrollments of 500-1,000 students to 12 percent at schools with enrollments of more than 2,000 students. For AP offerings, roughly half of schools with 500 or fewer students reported offering AP courses on site, whereas in schools with more than 1,000 students nearly all did so (96 to 98 percent). 14 In contrast, size did not appear to be related to schools' likelihood of offering dual enrollment: between 82 and 98 percent of schools offered dual enrollment. Again, the lower barriers of entry for schools (not having to obtain their own faculty or find enough students to fill an entire class) may help in making school size less of a factor in offering this type of college-level course. Two other significant differences by high school characteristics were also apparent. While the percentages are still small, schools were more likely to offer an IB program if they were located in an urban or suburban community (five percent and four percent, respectively) than if they were located in a rural area (one percent) (Appendix Table 2). This result may be related to school size: other types of college-level course offerings did not differ by locale. In addition, when examining just public high schools, those schools with a lower proportion of low-income students (measured as less than 20 percent of the student body receiving free or reduced-price lunch) were much more likely to offer at least one AP course on site (93 percent) than schools with a greater proportion of low-income students (between 50 and 76 percent) (appendix table 3)."}, {"section_title": "StudentS' PercePtionS of college AffordAbility", "text": "Controlling for other variables, the results in Table 2 (model 1a) indicate that the counseling variables are no longer significantly associated with students' perceptions of college affordability, but the following variables continue to have a significant effect: attending a private high school, student's math score, student's race/ethnicity, 28 parents' having at least bachelor's degree aspirations for their child, and parents' highest degree attained. When this full model is limited to students whose parents do not have a bachelor's degree, as shown in Table 2 (model 1b), many of the same results occurred. Attending a private high school, student's math score, parents' having at least bachelor's degree aspirations for their child, and parents' highest education continued to be significant and positively related to students' perception of college being affordable. However, there were two differences: students' race/ethnicity was no longer a significant predictor, while the time that counseling staff spent on collegegoing activities was significant.  25 note that researchers sometimes use the term \"first-generation college students\" to refer to students whose parents have no postsecondary education. 26 An odds ratio is the ratio between the odds that an event will occur for one group (e.g., parents with bachelor's degrees) and the odds that the same event will occur for a different, independent group (e.g., parents with high school diplomas or less). When the odds ratio for a particular outcome is greater than 1.0, there is an increase in odds for the analysis group as compared to the reference group. (For example, Table 2, column 1a shows that the odds ratio is 2.33 for students whose parents have bachelor's degrees or higher compared to students whose parents have high school diplomas or less. In other words, the odds of disagreeing for students whose parents have bachelor's degrees or higher were 2.33 times (or 133 percent greater than) the odds of disagreeing for students whose parents have high school diplomas or less). Odds ratios of less than 1.0 indicate the opposite: there is a decrease in the odds that a particular event will occur for one group as compared to another. In other words, an odds ratio of 0.79 represents a reduction in odds of 21 percent. 27 As part of its data collection, hSLS:09 administered a math assessment to ninth graders. hSLS students' score reflects their achievement on this test compared to all ninth graders. 28 The Wald chi-square test statistic for race/ethnicity is 9.6716 (d.f. 4), which results in a p-value of .0463. When using whites as the reference category, the odds for \"Other race\" (which includes students who report being American Indian, Alaska native, native hawaiian and Pacific Islander, or more than one race) are significantly lower than those for whites. Part II:  All students   NOTE: First-generation college students include those who do not have a parent who has attained a bachelor's degree. Postsecondary priority level uses a rank (1 to 4) reflecting the emphasis the counselor's counseling program puts on helping students plan and prepare for postsecondary schooling. \"Other race\" includes non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders, and students of more than one race. Estimates are weighted by W1PARENT. .  The final model (Table 3, model 1c) includes only those characteristics from Table 2 that were significantly related to first-generation college students disagreeing that their family could not afford to pay for college (i.e., perceiving college to be affordable). Compared to students whose counselors spent more than 20 percent of their time on college-going activities, students whose counselors spent less time (10 percent or less or 11-20 percent) had 21 and 25 percent lower odds, respectively, of thinking that college was affordable. 29 other variables that were significant in model 1b remained so in model 1c. First-generation students who attended a private high school had 38 percent greater odds of believing that college was affordable for their family than their peers attending a public school. In addition, as math performance increased, so did students' odds of believing college was affordable. Also, students with parents who expected their first-generation children to earn at least a bachelor's degree had 85 percent greater odds of disagreeing that their family could not afford college than students whose parents expected them to earn a high school degree or less. Having parents who expected their child to earn an associate's degree or who were unsure about their educational attainment netted no significant positive effect over having parents who expected their child to earn a high school diploma or less. Even among these first-generation college students, parents' education was a major factor in their opinion of college affordability. Children of parents who held an associate's degree rather than a high school diploma or less had 42 percent greater odds of believing college was affordable for their family."}, {"section_title": "STuDEnTS' PLAnS TO EnROLL In A BAChELOR'S DEgREE PROgRAM", "text": "The second outcome examined was whether ninth-grade students planned to enroll in a bachelor's degree program in their first year after high school. As Table 1 shows, in simple descriptive comparisons, students who reported talking to their school counselors about going to college and students with parents who reported conversations with counselors or teachers about admission requirements were significantly more likely to plan to enroll immediately after high school. Among the school characteristics explored, students attending private high schools or schools with higher four-year college-going rates were also significantly more likely to plan to enter a bachelor's program in the year after high school. Similar to the finding for perceptions of college affordability, student's math score, sex and race/ethnicity were also significant characteristics. Further, significant differences occurred by parental educational expectations for their children and educational attainment.   ) shows that even after controlling for related characteristics, several significant predictors in the logistic regression remained for all students. When accounting for different school, student and parent characteristics, three counselor characteristics emerged as significant predictors: caseload, students' speaking to counselors about going to college and parents talking to school counselors about admission requirements. School type, student's math score and sex also were significant predictors. Likewise, both parents' characteristics were significant; educational expectations and highest degree attained had a significant impact on children's plans to enroll in a bachelor's degree immediately following high school. The results in model 2b focus solely on first-generation college students. In terms of significant predictors, there is one difference from the model for all students. By definition, those students whose parents have attained a bachelor's degree or higher were removed, and once removed, the effect of parents' educational attainment on first-generation students' plans for enrolling in a bachelor's degree program disappeared. This finding suggests that, when focusing on future enrollment plans after high school, having parents with an associate's degree does not provide any additional benefit over having parents with a high school diploma or less. the final reduced model shown in table 4 provides insight into the level of influence each characteristic had on students' plans. First, it is worth noting that while counselor caseload was significant in the full model, after removing the least significant variables, caseload was no longer significant. 30 other variables significant in the full model remained significant in the reduced model. In terms of counselor-related characteristics, students' speaking to a counselor about going to college and parents' talking with a counselor or teacher about admission requirements both had a positive effect. Specifically, the odds of a student planning to enroll in a bachelor's degree program in the year after high school increased by 37 percent for students who had spoken to their counselor about going to college. For students whose parents spoke with counselors about admission requirements, the odds of planning to enroll in the first year after high school increased by 42 percent. Moving on to school and student characteristics, students at private high schools had 33 percent greater odds of planning to enter a bachelor's degree program and being female and having a higher math score continued to be positively related to bachelor's degree plans. Certain parent variables also remained important. While having parents with an associate's degree rather than a high school degree did not matter, parents' educational expectations for their child did. Compared to students whose parents expected them to attain a high school diploma or less, students with parents who expected them to attain an associate's degree or who did not know how far they would go in school had 54 percent and 57 percent greater odds, respectively, of planning to enroll in a bachelor's degree program. This increase in odds was even larger for students whose parents expected them to attain at least a bachelor's degree. The odds that these students planned to begin a bachelor's program immediately after high school were more than 2.5 times greater than for those students whose parents expected them to attain a high school diploma or less. "}, {"section_title": "STuDEnTS' SAT/ACT TEST-TAKIng PLAnS", "text": "The final outcome explored the college admission test-taking plans of those students who indicated that they would enroll in a bachelor's program in their first year after high school. As shown in Table 1, there was an association between students' test-taking plans and five counseling characteristics of interest: the hours spent on college readiness, selection and applications; the level of priority given to college counseling; whether schools provided assistance with seeking financial aid; whether students spoke to a counselor about going to college; and whether a parent spoke to a counselor about college admission requirements. Consistent across all three outcomes, school type and four-year college-going rates were also significantly related to whether students took or planned to take the SAT or ACT. All three student characteristics (student's mathematic test score, sex and race/ethnicity) and both parent characteristics (parents' educational expectations for their child and parents' highest degree attained) were also significantly related to test-taking plans. once all variables were included in the logistic regression model for all students, only two significant characteristics remained: whether a student had spoken to their school counselor about going to college and a student's math test score (Table 2, model 3a). Similarly, restricting the model to first-generation college students produced three significant (positive) predictors: the aforementioned two and a high school characteristic: the percentage of the student body that is black (Table 2, model 3b). table 5 presents the final reduced model for first-generation college students who planned to enroll in a bachelor's program after high school, examining whether or not they had taken or planned to take the SAT or the ACT. A student talking to a counselor about going to college continued to have a significant effect, more than doubling the odds that a student planned to take the SAT or ACT. once the nonsignificant variables were removed from model 3b, however, the key high school characteristic changed. The percentage of the student body that is black fell out of the model as no longer significant, while the four-year college-going rate became significant. Higher rates of four-year college-going were associated with slightly increased odds that students planned to take the SAT or ACT, suggesting that a college-going environment can be helpful. For every 10 percentage-point increase in the four-year college-going rate, the odds that students with bachelor's degree intentions planned to take the SAT or ACT increased eight percent. Finally, student's math score continued to be a significant positive predictor of students' going to a four-year college."}, {"section_title": "InTEgRATIng ThESE REgRESSIOn RESuLTS", "text": "Examining these regression results as a whole suggests that there are actions high school counselors can take to help put first-generation college students on track for a successful transition to postsecondary education. As the data in Table 6 suggest, counselors can first devote more of time to college readiness, selection and applications, as doing so was related to ninth graders' perceptions of college affordability. Second, counselors can initiate discussions with ninth graders about college. While we do not know who prompted these discussions, we do know that students who reported having them had greater odds of intending to enroll in a bachelor's degree program and planning to take the SAT or ACT. Third, counselors can initiate discussions with parents about college. While again we do not know who prompted these conversations, students with parents who had talked about college with counselors or teachers had greater odds of having bachelor's degree intentions. Holding these conversations with parents may in turn shape parents' educational expectations for their children, which are also significantly related to ninth graders' perceptions of college affordability and their bachelor's degree plans. We recognize that high schools and counselors do not only serve ninth graders and that the actions of high schools and counselors may have different effects on students' attitudes, aspirations, plans, and steps actually taken later on in their transition to college. These relationships will be examined in future reports that will be conducted as each new follow-up wave of HSLS data is released. "}]
