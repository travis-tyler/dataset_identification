[{"section_title": "", "text": "mechanism. As a receptor for coronavirus, ACE2 mediates the entry of SARS-CoV-2 11 into cells in a similar way as for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 12 (SARS-CoV). The high binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 correlates with its 13 efficient spread among humans. On the other hand, ACE2 negatively regulates the 14 renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) primarily by converting angiotensin II 15 to angiotensin 1-7, which exerts a beneficial effect on coronavirus-induced acute lung 16 injury. Human recombinant ACE2 has been considered as a potential therapy for 17 SARS-CoV-2 by blocking virus entry and redressing the imbalance of RAAS in 18 SARS-CoV-2 infection. The level of ACE2 expression can be upregulated by 19 treatment with an ACE inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin type 1 receptor blocker \u2161 20 (ARB). To date, no evidence shows that ACEIs or ARBs increase the susceptibility 21 and mortality of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and hence, it is not advisable to 22 discontinue such drugs in patients with cardiovascular disease. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), an important metalloproteinase, plays 51 a key role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. 1 ACE2 not only mediates viral infection but also 52 exerts important regulatory effects on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system 53 (RAAS) and participates in the development of acute lung injury (ALI) after infection. 54\nIntervention measures that target ACE2 may improve the prognosis of patients with 55 COVID-19. This paper comprehensively describes ACE2 structure and function, 56 regulation of ACE2 expression, and its role in viral infection and ALI. 57 58 ACE2 overview 59 ACE2 was discovered in 2000 as a homolog of angiotensin-converting enzyme 60 (ACE). 5,6 ACE2 is a type I transmembrane protein comprised of 805 amino acids. 61 ACE2 contains two domains, the amino-terminal and the carboxy-terminal domain. 62\nThe amino-terminal catalytic domain contains one active site, a zinc metalloprotein 63 domain that shares 41.8% sequence identity with ACE. 5-7 The gene that encodes 64 ACE2 is located on the X-chromosome at Xp22.2. 8 ACE2 is expressed in the human 65 heart, kidneys, lungs, liver, testes, and intestines. 6 In the heart and large vessels, 66 ACE2 is localized on the surface of endothelial and smooth muscle cells. In the 67 kidneys, ACE2 is mainly expressed on the apical membrane of proximal tubular 68 epithelial cells and colocalized with ACE. 9 In the lungs, ACE2 is mainly located on 69 type II pneumocytes, or may be found on type I pneumocytes and airway epithelial 70 cells. 10 71 72"}, {"section_title": "Function of ACE2 73", "text": "The functions of ACE2 can be broadly classified into two types: protease and 74 protease-independent functions. 75"}, {"section_title": "Protease function 76", "text": "ACE2 is a metalloproteinase and its active domain is exposed on the cell surface 77 to facilitate the catalysis of circulating polypeptides. ACE2 can cleave angiotensin I 78 into inactive angiotensin 1-9 (Ang 1-9) peptide, 5,6 which is further converted by ACE 79 or other peptidases into angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7) peptide. 5 Moreover, ACE2 can 80 efficiently metabolize angiotensin (Ang ) into Ang 1 \u2161 \u2161 -7, which binds to Mas 81 receptor (Mas), a G-protein coupled receptor, to exert vasodilation and 82\nanti-proliferation effects. 11 It is well established that Ang II has two G-protein-coupled receptors, the angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R) and 84 angiotensin receptor type 2 receptor (AT2R).\n\u2161 Ang II exerts its biological functions 85 and is involved in in pathogenesis of various diseases mainly through AT1R. The 86 activation of ACE/Ang II/AT1R pathway leads to vasoconstriction, proliferation, 87 fibrosis and inflammation, which may ultimately result in progressive tissue damage. 9 88\nThe effects of Ang 1-7 counterbalance the deleterious effects of the ACE/Ang 89 II/AT1R pathway 12-15 ( Figure 1 ). Ang 1-7 exerts multiple cardioprotective effects, 90\nincluding anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombotic, anti-fibrotic, anti-arrhythmic, and 91 natriuretic effects. It has also been shown to inhibit cardiac hypertrophy and plaque 92 formation, and ameliorate vascular dysfunction. 16 The ACE2/Ang 1-7/Mas pathway 93 has shown beneficial effects in many animal models of hypertension, heart failure, 94 ischemic cardiomyopathy, and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. 17 In the lungs, the Ang 95"}, {"section_title": "1-7 peptide inhibits inflammatory cell infiltration and regulates the release of anti-96", "text": "and pro-inflammatory cytokines to alleviate lung inflammation.

Although there is few direct evidence of SARS-CoV-2-induced ALI, we 296 speculate that SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV have a similar pathogenesis owing to 297 their high homology. An in-depth understanding of the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 298 will help in the development of targeted interventions to control the COVID-19 299 epidemic. ACE2 is not only a receptor that mediates coronavirus infection, but is also 300 an important RAAS enzyme that regulates virus infection-induced ALI. Although 301 increased ACE2 expression may elevate the risk of coronavirus infection, it may also 302 have protective effects against ALI. However, the effects of enhanced ACE2 303 expression (such as RAAS inhibition) on SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and patient 304 outcomes are not fully understood, and further basic and clinical studies are urgently 305 required. 306"}]
