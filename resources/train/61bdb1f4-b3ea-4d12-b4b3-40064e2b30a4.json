[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "To determine whether white matter network efficiency (WMNE) may be a surrogate marker of the physiological basis of resilience to cognitive decline in elderly persons without dementia and age and AD-related cerebral pathology, we quantified WMNE from baseline MRI scans and investigated its association with longitudinal neuropsychological assessments independent of baseline amyloid, tau and white matter hyperintensity volume. 85 cognitively normal elderly subjects and patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) with baseline diffusion imaging, CSF specimens, AV45-PET and longitudinal cognitive assessments were included. WMNE was calculated from reconstructed cerebral white matter networks for each individual. Mixed linear effects models were estimated to investigate the association of higher resilience to cognitive decline with higher WMNE and the modulation of this association by increased cerebral amyloid, CSF tau or WMHV. For the majority of cognitive outcome measures, higher WMNE was associated with higher resilience to cognitive decline independently of pathology measures (beta: .074 -.098; p: .011 -.039). Additionally, WMNE was consistently associated with higher resilience to cognitive decline in subjects with higher cerebral amyloid burden (beta: .024 -.276; p: .000 -.036) and with lower CSF tau (beta: -.030 --.074; p: .015 -.002) across all cognitive outcome measures.

However, individual predictions of cognitive decline are unsatisfactory from a clinical perspective due to considerable variance (Donohue et al., 2017; Insel et al., 2016; Jack et al., 2016; Vos et al., 2013) , which presumably refers to an individual's capacity to tolerate or compensate cerebral pathology, commonly termed reserve or -more generally -resilience (Barulli & Stern, 2013; Cabeza et al., 2018; Wolf, Fischer, & Fellgiebel, 2018; Yaffe et al., 2011) . The identification and quantification of an MRI-based surrogate of the physiological basis of this resilience could thus complement and significantly improve individual predictions of cognitive decline based on cerebral pathology. However, the underlying physiological basis of resilience to cognitive decline has not conclusively been identified so far. In this regard, white matter (WM) has received surprisingly little attention, although WM microstructural properties have repeatedly been demonstrated to be associated across the lifespan, including old age, with intelligence (Bathelt, Scerif, Nobre, & Astle, 2018; Fischer, Wolf, Scheurich, & Fellgiebel, 2014; Koenis et al., 2018; Li et al., 2009; Schmand, Smit, Geerlings, & Lindeboom, 1997) , which is a known factor of resilience to neurodegenerative disease (Stern, 2012; Whalley, Deary, Appleton, & Starr, 2004) . Furthermore, functional imaging studies have demonstrated that maintained functional connectivity is more associated with cognitive performance at higher age (Tsvetanov et al., 2016 (Tsvetanov et al., , 2018 and that the amount of neural resources that are recruited to process cognitive tasks is increased in higher age and in the presence of cerebral pathology (Reuter-Lorenz & Park, 2014; Stargardt, Swaab, & Bossers, 2015) . As WM facilitates information transfer and synchronization between networks of spatially distributed grey matter (GM) regions that are functionally joined in the processing of more demanding cognitive tasks, one might expect that higher WMNE modulates the efficacy of the integration and indeed, WMNE is associated with intelligence across the lifespan (Bathelt et al., 2018; Fischer et al., 2014; Li et al., 2009) . For these reasons we hypothesized that WMNE may be a candidate surrogate measure of resilience to cognitive decline."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu) .

For an extensive description, please refer also to the supplement. In brief, resilience can very generally be defined as cognitive outcome variance unexplained by pathology, which can be statistically modelled by partialling associations with pathology out of the cognitive outcome variable. The remaining variance, termed resilience, can be associated with the resilience factor, which is termed general resilience. However, pathology might modulate this association, which is termed dynamic resilience in the case of a positive interaction and limited resilience in the case of a negative interaction. To accommodate longitudinal data, a time variable can be included, as well as its interaction terms with pathology measures, the resilience factor and their interaction term:"}, {"section_title": "cog ~ t + path + res + path * res + t * path + t * res + t * path * res", "text": "where cog represents cognitive outcome, t the time variable, path pathology measures and res the resilience factor."}, {"section_title": "Statistical analysis", "text": "Longitudinal ADAS-cog, CDRSOB and MMSE measures were coded in single variables and set as cognitive outcome and thus as the dependent variables. The time of assessment of the cognitive outcome variables was encoded as an additional time variable that was set as an independent variable. Other independent variables consisted of baseline WMNE as potential resilience factor as well as AV45, TAU and WMHV as measures of baseline pathology. For each of these, a family of models were estimated representing all possible combinations of the following terms: WMNE, the interaction term of WMNE and the time variable, the first order interaction terms of WMNE and pathology measures as well as the second order interaction terms of WMNE, the time variable and pathology measures. Note that for models including interaction terms, the constituent terms were also always included in the models -including all three possible first order interaction terms of the individual elements of second order interaction terms. In total, this yielded 36 models to be estimated for each cognitive outcome measure. For a list containing the terms of each model, please\nrefer to the supplement.\nThe models were estimated as linear mixed effects models, wherein random intercepts for each subject and for clinical status at baseline (CN/MCI) were estimated. Additionally, all models included the baseline pathology measures AV45, TAU and WMHV as well as their interaction terms with the time variable. Years of education, age, gender and APOE4 positivity were included in all models as covariates. Subsequently, for each cognitive outcome measure and the corresponding family of 36 possible resilience models, the conditional Akaike Information Criterion (cAIC)was calculated (Greven & Kneib, 2010) as well as the Delta cAIC scores (differences between the model with the lowest cAIC score and each of the remaining models), the Akaike weights and the marginal coefficient of determination. All models with Delta cAIC lower than 2 were considered as models with substantial evidence.\nThe model terms of interest as per the extended resilience model described in the previous section were the interaction term between the time variable and WMNE (general resilience to cognitive decline) as well as the second order interaction terms of the time variable with WMNE and with baseline pathology measures (dynamic or limited resilience to cognitive decline). For these terms, significance testing was carried out if they were included in all models with Delta cAIC lower than 2 for each cognitive outcome. Significance testing was conducted using the LRT test as well as parametric bootstrapping at 1 million simulations per test. In the case of dynamic or limited resilience, the model with the lowest cAIC was compared to a reduced model with the term of interest (t * WMNE * path) removed. In the case of general resilience to cognitive decline, different models had to be compared, as the term of interest (t * WMNE) is a constituent term of all second order interaction terms. For this reason, all second order interaction terms were removed from the model with the lowest cAIC. This model was then compared to a further reduced model with the term of interest removed. Furthermore,the models with lowest cAIC were reestimated using robust linear mixed regression models.\nAll statistical analyses were conducted using R 3.4.0 as well as the packages \"lme4\" (Bates, M\u00e4chler, Bolker, & Walker, 2014) \"robustlmm\" (Koller, 2016) , \"cAIC4\" (S\u00e4fken, R\u00fcgamer, Kneib, & Greven, 2018) , \"pbkrtest\" (Halekoh & H\u00f8jsgaard, 2014) as well as \"car\" (Fox & Weisberg, 2019) . For cAIC and significance testing, models were estimated with maximum likelihood estimation. For coefficient reporting, models were reestimated using restricted maximum likelihood estimation. Two data points with implausibly low MMSE measurements (4 and 6) were removed in the respective models. All variables that were part of an interaction term in any model were centered to reduce collinearity (Aiken, West, & Reno, 1991) . Variance inflation was calculated for the best model for each cognitive outcome variable. WMHV was log-transformed to achieve approximate normal distribution.

In contrast, negative interactions were sucht that at higher amounts of TAU or WMHV, the interaction of WMNE with the time variable was decreased. Robust reestimation of models yielded coefficients of the same directionality and comparable magnitude. FDR correction at 5% did not lead to the rejection of any of the results. Pvalues reestimated using parametric bootstrapping were similar to those calculated by LRT.\nVariance inflation factors were below 2 for all predictors in the best fitting models. For an overview of estimated coefficients and respective statistics please refer to table 3.\nEvaluating the results of model estimation and significance testing in conjunction with the resilience framework described in the previous section leads to the following four results: First, as all the best models for each cognitive outcome measure contained significant interaction terms of "}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The main results of this study indicate that in a population of non-demented elderly with varying amounts of age-and AD-related cerebral pathology, higher efficiency of the cerebreal network may be associated with more resilience to cognitive decline. This association was increased at higher amounts of cerebral amyloid burden and decreased at higher levels of CSF tau. WMNE may therefore be a factor of dynamic resilience to cognitive decline with respect to amyloid load whilst being a limited resilience factor with respect to tau burden.\nTo our best knownledge, this is the first study investigating the association of WM network properties and resilience to cognitive decline, quantified as lower cognitive decline unexplained by baseline cerebral pathology. However, other studies have demonstrated associations between WM network properties and other non-physiological resilience factors. Specifically, three studies demonstrated an association between intelligence and WMNE (Bathelt et al., 2018; Fischer et al., 2014; Li et al., 2009) . A fourth study demonstrated an association between education and network flow, a measure quantifying hypothetical rerouting capabilities of the network(Wook Yoo et al., 2015) . Although these studies are of limited comparability due to differences in methodology and sample composition, one may be tempted to speculate that WM network properties and WMNE specifically may form part of the physiological basis of intelligence and education as resilience factors. However, as education was controlled for in all analyses of the present study, the association of WMNE with resilience to cognitive decline seems to go beyond the effects of education.\nA hypothetical mechanism by which WMNE may be associated with resilience to cognitive decline can be derived from its association with intelligence. Intelligence ratings consist of a number of cognitively demanding tests (Deary, Penke, & Johnson, 2010) . The synchronized processing of these tasks by functional networks of distributed regions requires efficient and effective information transfer between them, which in turn depends on the structural connectivity and integrity of WM tracts (Penke et al., 2012) . Additionally, there is evidence demonstrating that maintained functional connectivity is more associated with cognitive performance at higher age (Tsvetanov et al., 2016 (Tsvetanov et al., , 2018 and that the brain engages in compensatory activity in aging and the presence of cerebral neuropathology by recruiting additional neural resources across the brain (Reuter-Lorenz & Park, 2014; Stargardt et al., 2015) , which probably likewise depends on structural integrity and efficient organization as a modulator of functional reorganization. Assuming that the brains compensatory reaction to age-associated pathological changes is alike to the compensatory reaction to aging, the findings of the present study could be explained as follows: as the aging brain accumulates deteriorative changes such as loss of grey matter volume and in some cases AD-related pathology such as amyloid accumulation, it engages compensatory processes aimed at recruiting more neural resources, whose recruitment for task processing depends upon information transfer efficiency, a surrogate measure of which may be WMNE. It follows that as the brain accumulates age-and, potentially, AD-related deteriorative changes with the passage of time relative to baseline, WMNE will become more important for sustained cognition and thus more associated with resilience. This is supported by the finding of significant positive interaction terms of the time variable with baseline WMNE estimated for two out of three cognitive outcome measures considered.\nInterestingly, the association of WMNE with resilience to cognitive decline described above was increased in subjects with higher baseline cerebral amyloid load, thus indicating resilience to cognitive decline that is dynamic with respect to amyloid burden. This result was consistent across all cognitive outcome measures investigated and is also consistent with the resilience mechanism proposed above: elevated cerebral amyloid load has been demonstrated to be associated with a higher rate of cognitive decline (Donohue et al., 2017) . However, it is not locally associated with GM atrophy at the earliest preclinical stages of the AD trajectory (Karran, Mercken, & Strooper, 2011; Kljajevic, Grothe, Ewers, & Teipel, 2014) . In this scenario, compensation by recruitment of additional neural resources via the WM network would be both necessary as well as effective, as the to be recruited neural resources in the form of grey matter regions still remain mostly intact.\nHowever, the opposite may be true for increased levels of CSF tau at baseline, where the decrease of cognitive decline due to higher baseline WMNE was consistently lower for all three measures of cognitive outcome considered, thus indicating resilience to cognitive decline that is limited with respect to tau. Increased tau is usually accompanied by more clinically relevant cognitive impairment and neurodegeneration (Amlien et al., 2013; Sol\u00e9-Padull\u00e9s et al., 2011) , especially at later stages of the AD-typical trajectory commonly referred to as the amyloid cascade (Jack et al., 2013) . In this scenario, the to be recruited additional neural resources may already be impaired, which would probably render the compensatory functional reorganization less effective.\nAn alternative or perhaps complimentary explanation of the limited resilience to cognitive decline at increased levels of baseline CSF-tau is provided by the finding of WM microstructural integrity deterioration at increased levels of CSF-tau (Amlien et al., 2013) . These may not be reflected in the WMNE measure considered in this study, but impair network function such that compensation via recruitment of additional neural resources is rendered less effective. The same explanation could be applicable to the finding of limited resilience to cognitive decline at higher baseline volume of WMHV, which are associated with deterioration in local WM microstructural integrity and cognition (Vernooij et al., 2009 This study has several limitations. First, WMNE and pathology measures were measured at baseline. As such, further longitudinal associations or interactions between them could not be taken into account statistically. This means that the modulation of the association of WMNE with resilience to cognitive decline by pathology measures might have another alternative explanation: a lower association of resilience to cognitive decline with WMNE at higher baseline pathology could also be explained by a time lagged deteriorative association between the pathology measure and WMNE, whereas in this view a higher association between resilience to cognitive decline with WMNE at higher baseline pathology could be explained by time lagged (compensatory) neuroplasticity of WMNE as a response to increase baseline pathology. Second, the sample considered potentially includes subjects with future sporadic or familial AD, and the MCI cohort has additionally been enriched for memory impairment. As such, the variables considered probably do not follow a distribution representative for the general population, which may limit the generalizability of results. However, cognitive status (CN and MCI) was controlled for as a random variable in statistical modelling. Third, global pathology measures were used. Fourth, data were acquired at different sites and scanners. However, including center as an additional random effect did not alter results (data not shown)."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Higher WMNE may be associated with lower cognitive decline in cognitively healthy elderly and patients of MCI, especially so at the earlier stages of the AD biomarker cascade characterized by increased amounts of baseline cerebral amyloid load and low amounts of baseline CSF tau.
