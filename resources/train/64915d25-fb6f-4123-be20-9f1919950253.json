[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract. Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) commonly represents an intermediate stage situated in the spectrum between normal age-related cognitive decline and dementia. Predicting of MCI conversion to Alzheimer's Disease (AD) plays critical roles in early diagnosis and disease-modifying therapies. We analyzed baseline 3T MRI scans in 337 MCI patients from the ADNI-GO and ANDI-2 cohorts. The subjects were divided into MCI non-converters (MCInc) and MCI converters (MCIc). To evaluate conversion rates, we aim to first extract intermediate representations of structural MRI (sMRI) by a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) model, then combine principal component analysis (PCA) and sequential feature selection (SFS) for feature selection, and finally adopt support vector machine (SVM) for prediction. The method attained an accuracy of 77.58%, a sensitivity of 90.48%, a specificity of 76.42%, which may be useful and practical for clinical diagnosis."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most severe age related neurodegenerative disease, accompanying by brain structural and functional changes. In 2007, approximately 26.6 million people over 60 were diagnosed with AD, and it is expected to grow fourfold by 2050. The early diagnosis of AD is necessary to slow down the disease progression and decrease socioecomic burden. Neuropathological and neuroimaging evidences [1, 2] suggest that AD occurs decades before the onset of symptoms. Patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), specifically those with \"amnestic MCI\", is associated with a higher risk of developing AD, with a conversion rate of approximately 15% per year [3] . MCI, as an intermediate cognitive state between normal aging and diseased, can possibly predict the onset of AD. However, MCI patients is very heterogeneous, as some develop AD, some may remain stable over time, or revert to a normal cognitive state. Based upon follow-up diagnosis status, MCI patients can be divided into two subgroups: MCI patients who have converted to AD (MCI converters (MCIc)), and MCI patients who have not converted to AD (MCI non-converters (MCInc)). One promising biomarkers of early AD is structural changes measured by structural MRI (sMRI), a lot of efforts have been made to establish biomarkers using to predict the onset of AD at the MCI stage [4] [5] [6] with sMRI. The development of tools to detect those who are more likely to convert from MCI to AD is important for timely therapy and possible slow AD pathology progression.\nAlthough significant progress has been made in this area, most investigations have involved hand-crafted features based on prior knowledge and findings, which may not capture the most discriminative characteristic. Deep learning, which obviates feature engineering, by translating large-scale data into abstraction from at multiple layers, has achieved state-of-the-art performance applications related to image processing and image classification [7] . Convolutional neural network (CNN), such as AlexNet [8] has won the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Competition (ILSVRC) for 1000-class object classification. An effective image classification networks are frequently trained on data sets containing millions of images, facilitated by multiple computer servers for weeks, which is not feasible for the majority of neuroimaging studies. One approach to overcome this problem is the transfer learning. This is the process of recognizing and applying knowledge and skills learned from source task to a new target task (Figure 1 ). This study set out with the aim of exploiting the transfer learning idea into learning invariant and more transferable feature from MRI, which can be applied to classify MCI patients as MCIc or MCInc. In the following Section we first introduce the proposed method, then report the results of this study, and finally discuss the results and conclude the paper."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "The data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative [9] (ADNI) Grand Opportunity (ADNI-GO) and ADNI-2 studies (http://adni.loni.usc.edu). ADNI participants of this study include 337 MCI patients, whose baseline examinations had been downloaded. The demographic characteristics of the selected study population are summarized in Table 1 . The structural MRI data were collected according to the ADNI acquisition protocol using 3T scanners at multiple sites across the United States and Canada. MRI protocols ensured comparability across a variety of scanners (GE, Siemens or Philips).

Briefly, the procedure segments the sMRIs into gray matter (GM), white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid images. A customized template was created based on the GM segmentations using a diffeomorphic method known as DARTEL [10] . To preserve the gray volumes within each voxel, GM maps were modulated using the Jacobean determinants, and then the images were smoothed using an 8-mm FWHM Gaussian kernel. The dimensions of the smoothed, modulated, normalized GM maps were scaled with trilinear interpolation to 227\u00d7227\u00d765 (65 slices of size 227\u00d7227 for each subject), which matches the size of the input layer in the CNN. Then, the images were exported in a lossless Portable Network Graphics (PNG) format."}, {"section_title": "Features From CaffeNet", "text": "In this study, we used the CaffeNet architecture, an adaptation of AlexNet, which differs in training without any data augmentation and exchanging the form of subsample and normalization layers. The architecture of the CaffeNet is shown in Figure 2 . Based on the role they accomplish, CaffeNet is split into two parts. The first part is responsible for feature learning, which is comprised of five convolutional layers; while the second part encloses three fully-connected layers with an output layer of 1000 neurons for classification. The detail parameters of CaffeNet are listed on Table 2 . Features extraction was based on Caffe [11] , an efficient framework that is exploited by Berkeley Vision and Learning Center (BVLC). The intermediate layers capture features that are neither too specific to the dataset the network was originally trained on, nor too general to not contain any representative information from images. Features from conv3, conv4 and conv5 of the CaffeNet were extracted. For the conv3 and conv4 which do not have a pooling layer followed, we performed overlapping max-pooling within 3 \u00d7 3 regions and step size of 2 to get the final feature vectors. Features from 65 slices of each subjects were concatenated together to form the feature representation of the subject. "}, {"section_title": "Feature Selection and SVM Classification", "text": "The concatenated feature maps have too many features, principal component analysis (PCA) [12] and sequential feature selection (SFS) was used for the precise selection of the best features. PCA linearly transforms the original feature vectors in order to remove redundant dimensions, and generates vectors called principal components (PCs) in a lower dimension space. SFS generates PCs subsets and avoids the infeasible exhaustive search when the number of the PCs is large. In this work, we use the average miss-classification error (MCE) of 10-fold cross-validation with a supervised SVM classifier as the objective function of the search. The forward search is used because the number of selected features (p = 20) is much fewer than the total PCs (M = 429). 40 subjects from each group were randomly selected as the training set, the rest is the testing set. In this investigation, SVM implementation was taken from the LibSVM toolkit [13] ."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "We examined the performance of different layers for predicting MCI to AD conversion. The results indicate that the best performance was obtained using features extracted from the conv3 layer. The activation map of the conv3 layer is shown in Figure 3 . "}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "We present a study here of 337 MCI patients from the ADNI cohort. A transfer learning framework was proposed by making use of CNN pretrained on image data from a different domain. The approach to accomplish this generally consists of two stages. In the first stage, features are extracted from the MRIs by transfer learning and in the second stage these features are used as predictors for predicting MCI conversion. Since training a CNN from scratch requires huge amounts of data, the use of pretrained CaffeNet provides a potentially attractive approach. The results showed that the proposed method could offer consistently and substantially performance, with an overall classification accuracy of 77.58% for recognizing MCIc and MCInc patients. MCI conversion status could be predicted reliably by use of a CNN pretrained on non-medical images. These results also suggest that CaffeNet may yield good results in other neuroimaging studies. The current study is constrained by several factors. First, the proposed method is based on a CNN pretrained on a database of images of common objects. The source data base and the image sets could are dissimilar in color and objectiveness. Therefore feature extracted from the pertained CNN models may not necessarily capture all the relevant information. Second, intensities in grey matter map has been scaled from a real number to eight bits integer which might cause information loss. It is interesting to extend our current method for dealing with the real number of data for further improvement of performance. Third, one limitation in the use of CNNs is the inability to confidently dissect the mechanisms through which the conclusions are drawn. Filter visualisation may be a valuable area to help the researchers to better understand and improve models."}]
