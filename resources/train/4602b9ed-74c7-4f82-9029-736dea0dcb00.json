[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Background: Multi-site neuroimaging offer several benefits and poses tough challenges in the drug development process. Although MRI protocol and clinical guidelines developed to address these challenges recommend the use of good quality images, reliable assessment of image quality is hampered by the several shortcomings of existing techniques. Methods: Given a test image two feature images are extracted. They are grayscale and contrast feature images. Four binary images are generated by setting four different global thresholds on the feature images. Image quality is predicted by measuring the structural similarity between appropriate pairs of binary images. The lower and upper limits of the quality index are 0 and 1. Quality prediction is based on four quality attributes; luminance contrast, texture, texture contrast and lightness. Results: Performance evaluation on test data from three multi-site clinical trials show good objective quality evaluation across MRI sequences, levels of distortion and quality attributes. Correlation with subjective evaluation by human observers is \u2265 0.6.\nThe results are promising for the evaluation of MRI protocols, specifically the standardization of quality index, designed to overcome the challenges encountered in multi-site clinical trials."}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": "Brain imaging studies using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system is one of the strongest biomarker candidates for neurological diseases [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . MRI system is highly flexible. A single MRI system examination can be configured to generate several image sequences which can potentially provide high contrast structural information and the connectivity between brain structures [9] [10] [11] . The first listing of MRI as criteria for the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's diseases was in 2001 and 2010, respectively [12, 13] . Over the years, advances in technology, *Correspondence: marius.pedersen@ntnu.no 2 Department of Computer Science, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Teknologivegen 22, N-2815 Gj\u00f8vik, Norway Full list of author information is available at the end of the article strong collaboration among researchers coupled with availability of clinical data encouraged modifications [14] [15] [16] [17] to the initial diagnostic criteria. Despite several modifications to the initial diagnostic criteria, MRI criteria maintains a strong position to demonstrate the dissemination of multiple sclerosis disease in space and time and the exclusion of other disorders that can mimic its clinical and laboratory profile [18] .\nPharmaceutical companies incorporate multi-center neuroimaging in the design of clinical trials for the treatment and the monitoring of neurological diseases. Multisite clinical trials has several advantages. Main benefit is the ability to obtain more neuroimaging data per unit time across a wide variety of the patient population [19] . Other benefits include monitoring the progression of disease across a geographically, culturally and environmentally diverse population [20] .\nSeveral challenges encountered in multi-center neuroimaging studies result from the differences in MRI system parameters and image reconstruction routines. Two challenges are the variation of scanner technologies across the clinical trials sites and the different magnetic field inhomogeneities produced by a specific MRI model from the same manufacturer [21, 22] . These challenges renders acquired data including image quality evaluation unreliable with high risk of inaccurate diagnosis [20] .\nThere have been proposals to mitigate the effects of these challenges. They include careful coordination, the use of standardized phantom studies and strict quality assurance of recommended imaging protocols across the clinical trial sites [18, 23, 24] . Another mitigation measure is to ensure that end points derived from brain MRI images are subjective and heavily dependent on radiologist interpretation [25] . This approach is grossly inefficient in large scale clinical trials where large volume of data are processed. Conflicting results can result from the variability and lack of reproducibility in the interpretation of data by radiologists [2, 26, 27] .\nAcquisition and reconstruction of MRI image from k-space data is time consuming relative to other imaging modalities such as X-ray, ultrasound and computed tomography. The consequences which include patient discomfort and motion-related artifacts significantly limits the potential to acquire high quality images [28, 29] . At the post-acquisition stage such as multi-center clinical trials, the challenge is centered on standardizing MRI data from different MRI scanners and different MRI sequences. Quality evaluation beyond the acquisition stage is necessary to evaluate the performance of MRI protocols developed to mitigate the challenges in multi-site neuroimaging.\nMost proposed quality evaluation methods focus on the acquisition stage. There are few contributions on postacquisition quality evaluation of brain MRI images. They include [30] which apply analysis of variance (ANOVA) algorithm to assess the variation of several quality measures with different levels of distortions. The authors in [31] combine the detection of artifacts and estimation of noise level to measure image quality. In [32] null space analysis and just noticeable difference scanning method was proposed as a better quality metric compared to rootmean-square error (RMSE). The popular signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is the quality metric adopted in [33] . Recently the report in [34] propose a new method which predict brain MRI quality based on five quality attributes. The attributes are lightness, contrast, sharpness, texture details and noise. This report provide brief review of image quality evaluation. Detailed review of generic approaches to image quality evaluation can be found in [35, 36] . Review focussed on medical images is available in [31, 37, 38] .\nWe share the same opinion in [39, 40] which suggest that the design of application-specific, no-reference quality evaluation system is more realistic and practicable than the design of generic image quality evaluation systems. It will be futile to design a generic image quality metric because images possess unique characteristics that distinguish them within and across different classes. Furthermore current state-of-the-art generic quality evaluation algorithms will require significant modifications before application to medical images [37] .\nShortcomings of current state-of-the-art quality evaluation algorithm justify the need for new approach to quality evaluation in multi-center clinical trials. The contribution by [33] which adopt SNR is a full reference method based on the assumption that there exists a perfect image. In the real world a perfect image does not exist [37] . There are many definitions of SNR with no clearly defined range of quality index. These characteristics makes it difficult to compare quality measures from different imaging system, modalities and researchers [41] . Quality indices derived from SNR does not always correlate with the performance of observers using the imaging system on the task for which they are intended [41] . The use of SNR for quality evaluation can be said to be diagnostically misleading [42] because it cannot discriminate the quality of two images that are perceptually dissimilar [32] . The adoption of only artifacts and noise in [31] are too few attributes to evaluate the quality of an image. There are two setbacks for ANOVA based technique proposed in [30] . They are the risk of ambiguity in quality measures and the inability to transform the different levels of distortion into a quality index [43] .\nImage quality evaluation is difficult and complicated. Perceived image quality is influenced by several types of quality attributes and the different attributes influence each other [44] . The proposed method follow the threestep framework reported by Bartleson in 1982 [45] . The first step identify the most significant quality attributes of brain MRI images. They are luminance contrast, texture, texture contrast and lightness. The second step adopt image moments as global threshold to binarize and capture structural information contained in grayscale and contrast feature images derived from brain MRI images. Image moments have been successfully applied in many areas of image analysis such as image denoising [46] , speech recognition [47] , image normalization [48, 49] , reconstruction [50] , feature selection [51, 52] , contentbased image retrieval systems [53] and segmentation [54] , [55] . In the third step image quality is evaluated based on structural similarity between the pair of images derived by using different moments to binarize each feature image. This paper is organized as follows. The next section is the methods section. It include the setup of the experiment, problem formulation and implementation of the algorithm. The results of performance evaluation are presented in \"Results\" section and discussed in \"Discussion\" section. \"Discussion\" section highlight the limitations of our proposed method and the future work to overcome these limitations. \"Conclusions\" section concludes this report.

In the results section we demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method with six MRI volume data; three from NeuroRx, two from BrainCare and one from ADNI. The dataset from NeuroRx are one T2 weighted and two conventional T1 weighted. Each volume data contain 60 slices with dimension 256 \u00d7 256 pixels and 2.4 mm thickness. The T2 weighted and one of the T1 weighted MRI data are without any perceived distortion. The slices in the other T1 weighted data were originally acquired with various configurations of bias fields. There are two 50-slice, T2 weighted data without perceived distortion from BrainCare Oy. Each slice has dimension 448 \u00d7 408 pixels and 2.6 mm thickness. The remaining data is T1 magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) pulse sequence from ADNI. It contains 180 slices. Each slice has dimension 190\u00d7160 pixels and 1.2 mm thickness.\nPerformance evaluation was carried out in six categories. The first three categories evaluate the data in their original form of acquisition. They are T2 volume data without perceived distortion, T1 volume data without perceived distortion and T1 volume data degraded by bias fields. In the remaining three categories, three different types of degradation; circular blur, motion blur and Rician noise at different levels were artificially induced on the test data.\nAn image was degraded with circular blur by convolution with space-varying pillbox function. The parameter of circular blur is determined from the radial distance, in pixels, of the pillbox function. Motion blur degradation was done by a filter which approximates the linear motion of a camera. Motion blur is defined by linear and angular distances in pixels and degrees, respectively. Rician noise level was computed from the magnitude of Gaussian noise added to the real and imaginary components of the image. The real and imaginary components of the image are generated by making two duplicte copies of the image. Rician noise parameter is defined by the percentage of the maximum pixel intensity level in the image [56] . The different levels of circular blur, motion blur and Rician noise degradation were defined by scaling the respective parameters from 1 to 15."}, {"section_title": "Subjective Evaluation", "text": "In order to determine how our proposed method correlate with the human visual system we conducted subjective experiments with human observers.

The observers are one radiologist and one MRI reader. MRI reader is a trained professional with experience working on MRI images that are affected by pathology [33] . Mean opinion score (MOS) subjective experiment was chosen for the validation study because it is simple and popular. Mean opinion score is the average of the quality scores assigned to an image by multiple viewers [58] . The six categories of the objective experiment was used for the subjective experiment. The observer assigns a score between 0 and 100, in steps of 1 to each slice. In the category of MRI volume data with artificially induced distortion, each observer was first presented with an undistorted version of an MRI slice, followed by increasing distortion levels of the original slice. The distorted levels are 5, 10 and 15. The relationship between our objective results and the score assigned by human observers was determined using the spearman's rank correlation coefficient \u03c1 [59] :\nwhere n, the number of observations is the total number of slices contained in all the volume data in each category of the experiment, d is the difference between the two ranks of each observation."}, {"section_title": "Notational definitions", "text": "Here we explain and define the four binary images derived from the grayscale and contrast feature images.

The report in [60] recognize the need for better description of quality attributes in complex images. Contributions in the literature such as [61, 62] adopt terms such as luminance contrast, texture and texture contrast to describe quality attributes in specific complex images. Texture features has been widely applied to distinguish normal and abnormal structures in MRI images [63] [64] [65] . We regard MRI image as a two-tissue class complex image. With reference to a T2 weighted MRI slice the bright pixels describe the high density of edges that characterize the cortical gray matter and the boundaries between the different anatomical structures. The white matter and other anatomical structures other than the cortical gray matter are described by the dark pixels.\nWe assume that all the possible distortions in an image can be condensed into either space-invariant point spread function or multiplicative spatially varying factor H and random noise n according to the mathematical model of a 2D image acquisition process [66, 67] expressed by:\nwhere I d is the observed grayscale image and I f is the underlying ideal image. In the absence of distortion and following the two-tissue class model, the observed image and its local contrast feature image are replica of the underlying ideal image:\nBased on Eq. 7 the local contrast feature image and the observed image will have same pixel intensity level:\nWe hereby propose four quality scores. They are luminance contrast, texture, texture contrast and lightness. Each quality score is derived from the structural matching of relevant pair of binary feature images.

Second, different MRI sequence images are acquired for different tasks. This leads to the philosophy of task-based quality evaluation [71, 72] . Third, it is more realistic to compare the quality of similar MRI sequence images acquired for the same task. The quality measure is applied slice-wise across the MRI volume data. Generally, quality scores of slices contained in a MRI volume data lies within a narrow band of quality index. Based on our experience during the performance evaluation of our proposed algorithm and with specific importance to the opinion of human observers we recommend a cut-off quality index of 0.40 and 0.45 for T1 and T2 weighted MRI images, respectively.

Postacquisition image quality evaluation is necessary to reevaluate and standardize the quality of brain MRI images acquired from different clinical trial sites across the globe. No-reference objective image quality assessment is highly desired in environment where large volumes of MRI data are processed. We propose a new method to evaluate the quality of brain MRI images. The proposed method will be suitable for fully automated environments because processing of the quality metrics is on binary images. Experimental results demonstrates that our proposed method had good correlation with human visual judgement and gives fairly accurate quality evaluation within and across good quality images and different levels of degradation. personal research interests are centered on the use of advanced neuroimaging techniques to assess the pathological evolution of multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease and to quantify the effects of therapy on these diseases.
