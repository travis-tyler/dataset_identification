[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV2) is a zoonotic virus belonging to the betacoronavirus group of the coronaviridae family which also includes SARS-CoV and MERS. These viruses are known to cause severe acute respiratory diseases in humans. 1 The first confirmed case of SARS-CoV2 emerged in the Wuhan city of the Hubei province, China in December 2019. The WHO announced the epidemic of SARS-CoV2 as a public health emergency of international concern on 30th January 2020 due to the high human to human transmission rate and absence of any treatment or vaccine. 2 To date, it has spread to more than 200 countries and has been declared as a global pandemic. 3 "}, {"section_title": "SARS-CoV2", "text": "transmits through respiratory droplets and has a binding capacity, through spike proteins, to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors in the human respiratory system. 3 Clinical symptoms of SARS-CoV2 include cough, fever, shortness of breath, and -in severe cases -pneumonia and multiple organ failure. 3 SARS-CoV2 has an incubation period of 1-14 days and a substantial proportion of the infected persons appear to be asymptomatic.\nMoreover, these individuals are highly infectious before the onset of symptoms, which makes it a challenge to diagnose, contain and control transmissions. 1, 4 Initially, the mean basic reproduction number ( 0 ) of SARS-CoV2 ranged from 1.4 to 6.49, while some studies highlighted that the 0 stabilized around 2-3 leading to an exponential increase in the number of cases. 3, 5 Globally, many public and private enterprises are exploring treatment options and are in the process of vaccine development.

These interventions include social distancing, the closing of public places, academic institutes and schools, travel restrictions, quarantine for the infected, and -in some cases -curfew or lockdown. 9 However, issues in the health security infrastructure, disease surveillance, health systems, and limited availability of health professionals, makes it a challenge for containing and mitigating infectious outbreaks. 9 Considering these concerns, for appropriate preparedness, containment, and mitigation response, the stakeholders and policymakers require prior guidance on the propagation of SARS-CoV2. This study aims to provide such guidance by forecasting the cumulative COVID-19 cases up to 4 weeks ahead, and ascertain their accuracy using the Mean Absolute Percentage Error."}, {"section_title": "Data Sources", "text": "The daily level data for the cumulative COVID-19 cases, for 173 countries, and at the aggregated level for the entire world, was acquired from \"Our World in Data\" -a combined effort of the researchers at the University of Oxford and the Global Change Data Lab -which relies on the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) for data collection. 10, 11 Our sample period starts from the day of the first reported case for each country till 1 st June 2020.

Three of the forecasts are based on the autoregressive integrated moving average process which is usually denoted as ( , , ) where is the order of the autoregressive model, is the degree of differencing, and is the order of the moving average model. The model has been used for forecasting and assessing seasonality in infectious disease outbreaks. [12] [13] [14] [15] The model is a generalization of the autoregressive moving average ( ) model\nwith an ability to address the potential non-stationarity of the variable of interest. To test for stationarity of the cumulative COVID-19 cases, we used the Augmented Dickey-Fuller ( ) and Phillips-Perron ( ) unit root tests. The null hypothesis of these tests is that the variable contains a unit root, hence non-stationary, whereas the alternative is that the time series variable was generated by a stationary process. Table 2 reports the p-values, for the unit root tests, for the 29 countries with the highest cumulative COVID-19 cases and at the aggregated level for the entire world. Table 2 in the Online Appendix provides the results of the unit root test for the 173 countries.

A particularly na\u00efve attempt is to fit (0,1,0) which is commonly referred to as random walk and its forecasts are termed as random walk forecasts ( ). We generate the with and without drift for the variable of interest.\nA more systematic approach for fitting the model follows these steps: 16, 17 1. To ensure stationarity, the differencing order ( ) is selected by using the Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS) test.\n2. The lags, and , are determined by using the Akaike Information Criterion corrected for small sample sizes.\nAside from the model, we also used the exponential smoothing method ( ) for generating forecasts. is a forecasting method for univariate data which deals with the systematic trend and seasonality, and can be used as an alternative to the models. 18 To evaluate the performance of forecasts, the data is divided into two mutually exclusive sets, the training and test sets. The training set is used to fit the model (without using any data from the test set) whereas the test set is kept for evaluating the forecast accuracy. We use a variant of the time series cross-validation which is a more sophisticated version of the usual training-test set methodology. 18 In this method, there is a series of test sets, and each test set is accompanied by a corresponding training set consisting of observations before the test set. Therefore, a series of training-test sets are constructed, and for each training-test All rights reserved.

This method is more sophisticated than the usual training-test set methodology because it allows more comparisons of the forecasted and actual data values.\nThe time-series cross-validation method is also referred to as evaluation on a rolling forecasting origin because the origin of the test set is rolled forward in time. In simpler words:\n1. An origin for the first test set is selected.\n2. Forecasts are determined for the test set using the corresponding training set.\n3. The origin is rolled forward by one period generating a new training-test set for which forecasts can be evaluated, and so on.\nIn this study, we take the 45 th day -since the first reported case in the country -as the origin which is then rolled forward one day at a time. The variation in our methodology is that, instead of taking each of the test set as a single observation, we take four different test sets for each training set: 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, and 4 weeks into the future. This allows us to ascertain the accuracy of the forecasting method up to 4 weeks ahead for each training set. Therefore, we include countries with at least 73 (45+28) observations to ensure that there is at least one available test set for the 4 weeks ahead forecasts for each country included for the forecast evaluation.\nSuppose the country under consideration has data available for \u2208 {1,2, \u22ef , }. The following steps explain the methodology:\n1. Use the data available till = 45, and forecast the values of + for \u2208 {1,2, \u22ef ,28}\ni.e. obtain the forecasts for the next 28 days or 4 weeks. All rights reserved.

On the other hand, data-driven techniques can provide information on the confirmed number of cases with high accuracy. For this study we focused on the cumulative COVID-19 cases, however, the forecasting methods can be used for other indicators such as cumulative deaths, cumulative recovery, etc. The forecasts of the confirmed number of cases are sensitive to the number of tests performed, however, since the confirmed number of cases is an indicator of the anticipated burden on the healthcare system and professionals, the projections by the data-driven techniques might be insightful for the policymakers. This is important because the availability of health service resources during COVID-19 is an issue faced by many countries. One study carried out in different states of the United States predicted an excess demand of 64,175 total beds and 17,380 ICU beds at the peak of COVID-19. 23 Even with lockdown measures enacted, the peak demand for healthcare services, during the COVID-19 pandemic, is likely to exceed capacity irrespective to the current capability of the healthcare infrastructure and resources.\nGlobally, our forecasting results reveal that the number of cases will increase in most of the countries. Forecasted scenarios for June depict that some of the hardest-hit regions include the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, some parts of Europe, South America, and South Asia as shown in Figure 2 of the Online Appendix. Middle eastern countries including Iran, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia also show an increase in the cumulative COVID-19 cases.\nAll rights reserved.
