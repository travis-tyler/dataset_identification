[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Distinguishing neurodegenerative diseased patients (e.g., suffering from Alzheimer's Disease (AD)) from healthy individuals with the aid of MRI images is one of the challenges that need to be addressed in the field of Computational Anatomy (CA). A crucial feature in the analysis is the rate of atrophy of brain structures like the hippocampus or the ventricles. Until recently, analysis of atrophy rate has been restricted mainly to 'localized atrophy', i.e. atrophy within one brain structure. Distinguishing correlations of local atrophy rates between different brain structures could possibly provide additional information about the disease process. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce four correlation parameters to measure and analyze correlations of atrophy rate between hippocampus and ventricles. We combine these parameters with three local atrophy rate parameters into a sevendimensional vector, and use various vector classification methods to see if the methods can distinguish AD patients from normal (NL) subjects in 31 longitudinal MRI baseline images and their follow-ups from the ADNI database. We obtain a good agreement between our classification results and the ground truth data. The analysis is facilitated with the aid of a specially designed graphical user interface."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most costly diseases for society in Europe and the United States, and with the aging population its occurrence will increase in the future. Therefore, quick and reliable diagnostic tools will be of great importance. The diagnosis of AD is presently done with the aid of a number of neuropsychiatric tests (like MMSE), and supplemented by the analysis of MRI brain images. In the MRI images, the progression of AD can be quantified by the temporal atrophy rate. In AD patients, atrophy occurs at a faster rate than in normal (NL) persons, at the onset of the disease particularly in the hippocampus and the ventricles. This process can be identified in the MRI images by comparing images of the same patient, at different times (denoted as \"longitudinal studies\"). At present, the diagnosis of AD is being performed by a radiologist, comparing these scans \"by eye\". For a more quantitative, reliable and reproducible procedure, automation of the diagnostic process would be very useful. The field that deals with these issues is denoted as \"Computational Anatomy\" (CA), a term introduced by Grenander and Miller in 1998 [1] . In order to perform a quantitative analysis, transformations of images into one another need to be defined and calculated, after which the diagnosis can be facilitated through the calculation of \"diagnostic parameters\". The calculation of the transformations is denoted by the term \"registration\", and can be performed in many ways [1, 5] . The study of atrophy is most easily done if the two images that are compared are well aligned, and without artifacts like intensity differences that are not due to structural differences. This means that some preprocessing needs to be done: 1. Intensity differences due to the bias field of the MRI detector need to be corrected. 2. There should be intensity scaling and/or histogram equalization to remove the differences in intensity that are not due to structural differences. 3. Rigid (or affine) registration needs to be performed to remove misalignment of the images. Subsequently we can perform the transformation that deforms structural differences in the images (called \"local registration\"). For this paper, as in ref.\n[3], we use Christensen's fluid-dynamical method [2] . This method calculates a (local) deformation field ( ) u r ( ) u( , that is driven by a body force that is based on local intensity differences of the images. This field can then be used to calculate the (diagnostic) parameters (See, e.g., refs. [1, 5] In this paper we introduce the possibility of measuring correlations of deformation between different brain structures through the introduction of a number of \"correlation parameters\". In addition we measured three \"volume parameters\", that are possibly less sensitive to imperfect rigid registration. We extended the functionality of our user interface to include these functions. Then we performed an analysis using vector classification methods on the same dataset we used for the analysis of [3] , to examine whether differences between AD and NL subjects could be identified with some combinations of the features. It appeared that such differences did indeed occur, and that a good correspondence was achieved between the diagnosis and the ground truth data. Thus, the quantitative automatic analysis with the aid of the new parameters adds some extra diagnostic power to the version discussed in ref. [3] . This paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we describe the diagnostic parameters. In Section 3 we describe some aspects of the new user interface, particularly the part that facilitates the selection of the regions that can be studied. Section 4 describes the different vector classification methods to distinguish AD from NL with the aid of our diagnostic parameters. In Section 5 we present the experimental results, and we conclude in Section 6."}, {"section_title": "DIVERGENCE AND CORRELATION", "text": "PARAMETERS In this section we introduce the parameters mentioned above, and give a short motivation for their use.\n1. The divergence of the deformation u u\nAn integration of this quantity over a certain region can show whether sources of compression or expansion appear within this region, and can thus be used to identify atrophy. The next few parameters are the ones that measure correlations between two brain regions. 2. The directional correlation coefficient\nHere, R, and R' are the two brain regions that are considered, R N is the number of points inside region R,\nWhen the average deformation is in a similar direction for both brain regions, then this will result in a larger value of the coefficient than when the deformation is in different directions, or randomly distributed. This provides an indicator that can distinguish a large global deformation (that can be due to imperfect rigid registration) from local deformations.\n3. Mean Scalar Product Correlation.\nParameters 2. and 3. together yield an indication of the correlation of the size and the direction of the deformation of two regions.\nThis gives an indication of whether the joint deformation of two regions is large for both regions, and whether it is in the same direction, e.g. it will be large and positive if there is mainly expansion or contraction in both regions. This coefficient will yield an indication about whether there will be mainly contraction or expansion in both of the regions, and their correlation."}, {"section_title": "VISUALIZATION ENVIRONMENT", "text": "We implemented the enhanced Graphical User Interface in Matlab. Below we describe some of its functionality."}, {"section_title": "Region of Interest (ROI)", "text": "In the user interface, the starting screen shows pictures of the displacement u u , as well as pictures of the Jacobian displacement J\u2032, and a 3D vector plot of deformation of a slice (Fig.1) . The regions that are used to calculate the correlation coefficients mentioned above can be selected from this window either manually, or automatically, using the data of the IBSR mask. In addition, because of their overall low intensity compared to the tissue regions, the ventricles can be segmented automatically with the ChanVese method, where we use convexity and edge conditions for correction of initially imperfect results. The result for a volume of 16 coronal slices is shown in Fig.2 . "}, {"section_title": "Fig. 2.

In this way, the local distribution of the deformation within the ROI can be monitored, which yields additional information about the deformation in this region."}, {"section_title": "Fig. 3. Deformation vector plot of 3D ventricle regions in the brain.", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "VECTOR CLASSIFICATION METHODS", "text": "After we select two ROIs R and R', we can determine the correlation coefficients given by Eqs. (2)-(5). In addition we can determine the integrated divergence of the regions. Because the size of the ventricles is also a reliable indicator of AD, and because its segmentation can be done accurately, we also added this to the feature vector. This provides us with a seven dimensional vector. In order to investigate whether information about the difference between AD and NL could be derived from such a vector, we performed several experiments using automated vector classification methods. It is not clear beforehand which method will yield the best results. Therefore we tested three of them, viz. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), K-nearest neighbour (KNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The LDA method is a way to find a linear combination of features which discriminate two or more classes of objects. The KNN method is a method for classifying objects based on closest training examples in the feature space. The SVM method is used to find an optimal boundary based on a few feature points (support vectors), and it can map non-linear separable features into a higher dimension space and make it linearly-separable. The study we describe below should give a first indication of whether the application of such a method could be developed further and studied in greater detail, for which the discerning effects should be significantly present."}, {"section_title": "EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS", "text": "In our experiments, we used brain MRI data from the ADNI database [4] . We used 19 sets of NL subjects' and 12 sets of AD patients' longitudinal brain MRI images as input to compute the displacement field and Jacobian determinant between the baseline and the follow-up images by Christensen's method. For each pair of images we applied the method to 16 central coronal slices of a MRI volume. For each longitudinal group of data and their derived deformation field and Jacobian determinant, we computed the coefficients given in Eqs. (2)- (5), when R and R' are the ventricles and hippocampus regions within this volume of 16 slices respectively, as well as the and ventricle region size and the ventricle and hippocampus region divergence as our seven components feature vector. The sizes of the features may play a role, e.g. in the determination of the distances between vectors. Therefore we study them both in their original range (NonScaled), and with all of them scaled between 0 and 1 (Scaled). We tested these three methods on different combinations of the input features. In addition, we used the leave-one-out cross validation method to test the usefulness of both the features and the classification methods. From the LDA method, we find that for the best combination, the accuracy of the classification for all the data set is 87.1%. When either only AD or only NL MRI sets are used to validate the performance of the classification, the accuracy is 75% and 94.74%. Thus considering the percentage of AD and NL in our whole dataset (12 in 31, and 19 in 31), it becomes clear that the optimal result does not occur when all subjects are considered simultaneously, as is shown in Table 1 . Therefore, this method is not an optimal one. we choose the parameter K=2, and from the result, we find that this method can achieve a higher best feature combination classification accuracy (for over all, the optimal accuracy is 93.55%), shown in Table 2 . However, it still has the same problem as the LDA method, viz. that the optimal AD, NL and overall optimal accuracy do not occur at the same time. This is because some of the combinations can lead to a very high accuracy in either AD and NL case, but a lower accuracy of the other case. As a result, the optimal overall accuracy can be smaller than both the optimal AD patient accuracy and the optimal NL accuracy. As shown in Table 2 , the scale of the features will largely affect the accuracy. A better solution, that keeps both high accuracy and the simultaneous optimal accuracy for AD, NL and overall data, was obtained by the SVM method with a Quadratic kernel function. From the result, which is shown in Table 3 , we can see that it has a high accuracy (90.32% for all sets), while the optimal AD and NL accuracy rate can be achieved at the same time for the original feature data and the Scaled feature data, as shown in Table 3 . 90.32% Thus, in our experiment, the SVM performs better than the LDA and KNN methods. The combination of the input features for which the SVM method attains its highest accuracy is given by: Directional Correlation Coefficient of the ventricle and hippocampus, Mean Jacobian Displacement Correlation of the ventricle and Hippocampus and Ventricle Region size. (This is obtained with the aid of an exhaustive search)."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "In this work, we performed a study of the correlations of atrophy between the hippocampus and the ventricles for distinguishing AD patients from NL persons. We combined the correlation parameters together with a few other deformation parameters into a seven-dimensional vector, and applied three vector-classification methods to investigate if such vectors could yield distinguish between AD and NL subjects in agreement with the ground truth data for 31 subjects from the ADNI database. In order to facilitate the diagnostic analysis, we built a user interface that can visualize the deformation within the structures we want to study, and can facilitate the selection of the regions for which we want to measure the local and inter-structural effects of atrophy. All three vector methods showed good agreement of the diagnosis with the ground truth data, but the SVM method yielded the best results. Why this is so is not clear at present, however. We also performed a leaveone-out cross validation to see which parameters were most useful for the diagnosis. We find that the Directional Correlation Coefficient of the ventricle and hippocampus, Mean Jacobian Displacement Correlation of the ventricle and hippocampus and Ventricle Region size are the most useful. The methods we used here provide some new features to the ones we developed in ref. [3] ."}, {"section_title": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": ""}]
