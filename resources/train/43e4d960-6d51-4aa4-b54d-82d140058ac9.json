Walking speed is also predicts five and ten year survival rates over and beyond age . In fact, it has been suggested that evaluation of walking speed should become standard clinical measurement for older adults as it is easily evaluated in a clinic settings (Cummings, Studenski, & Ferrucci, 2014; Peel et al., 2013) .\nAlthough walking speed is a promising clinical measure, very few studies have tested the hypothesis that increasing walking speed could lead to less disability. Indeed, since the physiological mechanisms that lead to walking speed decline with aging are not completely understood, it is difficult to develop tailored preventive interventions. Age-related differences in biomechanical characteristics of gait may offer some clue on the mechanisms underlying gait speed decline with aging. Older adults have slower walking speeds compared to younger adults and tend to have shorter stride lengths (Judge, Davis, & Ounpuu, 1996; Samson et al., 2001) . There are also differences between older and younger participants in stride width and time spent in double support (Gabell & Nayak, 1984) . It has been suggested that movements in the sagittal plane, greater lateral movement and even double stance time, are related to compensatory strategies to address progressive balance impairments, and may result in slower gait speeds (Gabell & Nayak, 1984) . Interestingly, even among older adults, those who are older have slower walking speed, slower cadence, shorter stride lengths and higher mechanical work expenditures (S. U. Ko, Stenholm, Metter, & Ferrucci, 2012; S. Ko, Ling, Winters, & Ferrucci, 2009) . Some studies reported that cadence was associated with age among older adults, while others report no age related differences in cadence (S. U. Ko, Tolea, Hausdorff, & Ferrucci, 2011; Samson et al., 2001) .\nRemarkably, most work examining gait parameters and walking speed is cross-sectional, and it is mostly unknown whether changes in gait biomechanical parameters emerge before or in parallel to the decline in speed. Thus, there is great need of studies that examine gait characteristics and test the hypothesis that they are predictive of future decline of walking speed in older adults. This includes determining if basic spatio-temporal gait parameters (i.e. stride length) and kinetic parameters (i.e. mechanical work expenditure 1 , double stance) known to differ by and vary with age are predictive of walking speed slowing and decline. Attention to spatio-temporal gait parameters in concert with kinetic parameters may be especially important in generally healthy, well-functioning older adults in whom the start of the decline process may be particularly difficult to detect.\nImportant methodological work has identified walking speed declines as small as 0.03 to 0.06 meters per second to be meaningful among older adults (Kwon et al., 2009; Perera, Mody, Woodman, & Studenski, 2006) . Meaningful was defined using an anchor based approach to identifying the minimal change perceived as meaningful to the individual (Guyatt et al., 2002) . These small detectable changes in walking speed have been identified across demographic groups in healthy older adults and among older adults with clinical conditions (Kwon et al., 2009; Perera et al., 2006; Perera et al., 2014) . Identifying early markers of decline among relatively healthy older adults could allow for timely intervention to slow the decline process.\nThis study examined the association between gait characteristics and decline in walking speed over an average follow-up of three years in generally high functioning older adults participating in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA). Gait characteristics including stride length, stride width and mechanical work expenditure were assessed with a three dimensional motion capture system and force platforms. Usual walking speed was determined during a short corridor walk and change in walking speed was calculated between two study visits."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "The Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging is a continuous enrollment cohort study of normative aging conducted by the National Institute on Aging (NIA), Intramural Research Program (IRP).

Eighty-two participants (23%) had meaningful decline (i.e. decline \u2265 0.05 m/s/y) in usual walking speed. Table 2 , walking speed was positively associated with mechanical work expenditure and stride length, and negatively associated with double support and walking speed change (ps<.05).

Table 3 displays logistic regression results both partially adjusted (i.e. age, sex, race, height, weight, and follow-up time) fully adjusted model (i.e. aforementioned variables and all gait characteristics). In the partially adjusted model, faster cadence [ORadj = 0.65, 95% CI (0.47,0.91)], higher MWE (anterior-posterior) [ORadj = 0.79, 95% CI (0.68,0.91)] and longer stride length [ORadj = 0.89, 956% CI (0.86,0.91)] were associated with lower odds of decline.

In a sensitivity analyses (data not shown) we examined the association among gait characteristics and absolute decline in those individuals who had an absolute decline of .05 m/s or greater without respect to the duration of follow-up (n=147). In the fully adjusted model, stride length was the only gait characteristic associated with absolute decline with longer stride length being protective."}, {"section_title": "As shown in", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In relatively healthy older adults, and independent of potential confounders, longer stride length had a cross-sectional association with faster walking speed and was protective of meaningful walking speed decline over a 3-year follow-up. In fact, for each additional centimeter of stride length there was a 17% lower likelihood of meaningful decline in usual gait speed. This association was consistent after controlling for other gait characteristics and demographic attributes, including height. In addition, after accounting for differences in gait characteristics, the effect of age on the risk of meaningful walking speed decline was no longer significant. These findings indicate that stride length is a critical gait characteristic involved in the pathways that leads to decline of walking speed in older adults.\nFaster cadence was also protective against meaningful decline in usual gait speed. Specifically, for each 10 steps per minute increase in cadence there was a 40% lower likelihood of meaningful decline in usual gait speed.Among NHANES participants a cadence that was ten steps per minute faster was associated with a 4% decrease in all-cause mortality and the ability to walk 100 steps per minute was associated with a reduction in cardiovascular related deaths (Brown, Harhay, & Harhay, 2014) . In the latter case it is not clear if cadence is simply a gait characteristic or actually a marker for cardiovascular fitness. In fact cadence is used as an indicator of walking intensity when translating national physical activity recommendations into step based recommendations and a cadence of 100 steps per minute was identified as the lower threshold for moderate intensity physical activity (Tudor-Locke et al., 2011) . It is also possible that cadence and stride length moderate the relationship between MWE and declines in gait speed. That is, higher MWE (anterior-posterior) is needed for longer stride length and faster cadence and the influence of MWE on gait speed is through changes in stride length and cadence. A better understanding of the factors conditioning both stride length and cadence can help inform prevention strategies.\nThe fully adjusted model also indicated that those who had more energy expenditure side to side (i.e. medial-lateral) had higher odds of meaningful decline in gait speed [ORadj = 1.95, 95% CI (0.95,4.00)]. This relationship approached significance in this study and is aligned with theoretical compensatory adaptations. Movement in the sagittal plane is hypothesized to be a compensatory strategy and perhaps the higher medial-lateral mechanical work expenditure is a marker of active compensation for other biomechanical issues. In a post-hoc analyses (data not shown) medial-lateral mechanical work expenditure had a significant bivariate association with both weight and body mass index (p < .001). Clarifying the association between medial-lateral mechanical work expenditure and meaningful decline in walking speed is beyond the scope of this manuscript.\nTranslation of these findings into prevention and treatment efforts will require a better understanding the modifiable factors that modulate stride length. Physical therapists have used both motor learning and traditional exercise approaches to improve gait characteristics in older adults with mobility dysfunction (Brach, Van Swearingen, Perera, Wert, & Studenski, 2013; VanSwearingen, Perera, Brach, Wert, & Studenski, 2011) . A communitybased exercise program was shown to increase walking speed, lengthen stride and increase cadence among older women (Lord et al., 1996) . There is even preliminary evidence that music can help older adults increase cadence and stride length (Eikema, Forrester, & Whitall, 2014) . This suggests that stride length and cadence may be volitional decisions rather than strictly a functional of physical ability. Indeed psychological factors may condition gait characteristics. For instance, fear of falling is associated with slower walking speed, shorter stride length, and slower cadence in older adults (Chamberlin, Fulwider, Sanders, & Medeiros, 2005; Mortaza, Abu Osman, & Mehdikhani, 2014) . Pain has also been associated with lower walking speed and patient advocacy may be needed to ensure appropriate pain management and orthopedic care (Patel, Guralnik, Dansie, & Turk, 2013) . Although the study focused on biomechanical determinants of walking speed decline, effective prevention efforts will likely address a range of putative factors.\nThe current findings suggest caution in generalizing longitudinal associations between gait characteristics and walking speed from cross sectional analyses. The cross-sectional analyses indicate age is associated with slower gait speed, yet the longitudinal analyses suggest that gait characteristics, not chronological age have the strongest association with declines in gait speed. Similarly caution is warranted in generalizing from bivariate associations as cadence and stride length may mediate the association among kinetic gait characteristics and gait speed declines.\nThe prospective study design limits our understanding of these associations and trials are needed to better understand the effect of improved gait characteristics on the development of decline. Additionally this study used a non-representative sample of older adults and although this limits the generalizability of the findings, use of a relatively healthier, better functioning, population allowed examination of gait characteristics and walking speed decline in the earliest stages of disablement. Another limitation is the assessment of usual walking speed in a laboratory setting. Assessment of cadence during free living (activity occurring during the course of a day) revealed that cadence varies during different tasks making it difficult to determine usual cadence and gait speed (Tudor-Locke & Rowe, 2012) . A better understanding of gait characteristics during free-living may help with our understanding of the decline process and develop recommendations for prevention. A longer follow-up time with standardized assessment intervals could provide more insight into how these gait characteristics are associated with the development of meaningful decline. Strengths of the study include assessment of spatiotemporal and kinetic gait characteristics, a broad age range, sex and race diversity and longitudinal data."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "In a sample of relatively healthy older adults 23% demonstrated a meaningful decline in usual walking speed during an average three years of follow-up.

In the fully adjusted model, cadence and stride length, but not age, was associated with walking speed decline. This suggests that decline in usual walking speed was more closely associated with gait characteristics than chronological age. It is yet to be determined if modification of gait characteristics can attenuate walking speed declines previously characterized as age-related."}, {"section_title": "Highlights", "text": "\u2022 Among healthy older adults, 23% experienced a meaningful decline in walking speed within three years.\n\u2022 Persons with a longer stride were less likely to experience meaningful decline in usual walking speed.\n\u2022 Persons with a faster cadence were less likely to experience meaningful decline in usual walking speed.
