Currently, the disease mechanism of AD is not comprehensively understood, and consequently no disease-modifying treatments are available. Unfortunately, current symptomatic treatments only have a moderate effect. 1 There is therefore a desperate need for a disease-modifying treatment for AD.\nA definitive AD diagnosis can only be made post-mortem; however, neuropathological biomarkers (amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) plaques and phosphorylated tau tangles) can be used to help differentiate AD from other dementias during a person's lifetime. These can be used in a clinical trial setting to ensure that all recruited participants have evidence of the target pathology. In a trial of Bapineuzumab, an anti-amyloid therapeutic, 14% of subjects had low amyloid. It was therefore unlikely that these subjects would see any benefit from the treatment. Furthermore, their involvement in that study would have reduced the statistical power of finding a treatment effect. 2 Many trials now test for elevated neocortical amyloid burden (NAB) as an eligibility requirement.\nElevated NAB is also becoming an eligibility criterion for some prevention trials, such as the A4 trial. 3 This trial aims to assess whether anti-amyloid therapeutics can delay early cognitive decline in asymptomatic individuals, a concept that has developed as a result of research showing that AD has a long prodromal stage. 4, 5 The characteristic disease pathology of AD can begin to develop up to 20 years before any clinical symptoms. 6, 7 This provides a window of time for a potential treatment to stop, or at least slow down, future progression of the disease.\nNeuropathological biomarkers are measured by quantifying the concentrations of A\u03b2, tau and phosphorylated tau in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or via positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. In addition, metabolites in CSF have been studied as possible biomarkers for AD and related phenotypes. 8 However, the methods used to capture this information are invasive, require specialized equipment and are often expensive and hence impractical on a large scale.\nConsequently, there is a high demand for a blood-based biomarker of AD that would be easier and potentially cheaper to attain. 9 Metabolites are typically smaller than other biological molecules, and therefore have a greater chance of passing through a possibly weakened blood-brain barrier. 10 This increases the chance that blood metabolites could serve as a biomarker of AD. A review of AD biofluid metabolite studies has highlighted sphingolipid and glutamate metabolism as being altered in AD, besides the metabolism of molecules with antioxidant properties. 11 In addition, Proitsi et al. used a case-control study design to discover a set of long-chain cholesteryl esters associated with AD, whereas other studies have aimed to predict conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD.\n12-14 Mapstone et al.\n13 discovered a lipid panel from peripheral blood that predicted conversion from control status to amnestic MCI or AD with 90% accuracy. The panel highlighted metabolites involved in cell membrane integrity and lipids involved in cell signaling, as also suggested by Whiley et al."}, {"section_title": "15", "text": "These studies should now be extended to identify markers of amyloid pathology.

All metabolic features, age and APOE \u03b54 status were included in the model building. The number of components to include was tuned using five-fold CV through the 'train' function. Recursive feature elimination was used to select a subset of variables using five-fold CV. The subset sizes considered varied from 2 to Blood metabolite markers of neocortical amyloid burden N Voyle et al 99 in steps of 1 and from 100 to the total number of covariates in steps of 100. In PLS modeling, the lowest root mean squared error (RMSE) was used to select the best model, whereas for PLS discriminant analysis the highest accuracy was used. The function 'pickSizeTolerance' was then applied in an attempt to find a smaller subset of variables that maintained RMSE or accuracy to within 5% of the best model. We also built models using the 10 most important predictors, the maximum number of metabolic features we could feasibly identify. Model statistics resulting from five times CV within recursive feature elimination are presented in this report. For comparison, we used five-fold CV to build a model based on age and APOE \u03b54 status alone using the 'train' function to tune the number of components as above.

The subjects used here have a wide range of diagnoses that can be grouped into four categories: AD, fronto-temporal dementia, MCI and healthy controls. Of these 78 subjects, 2 did not have SUVR available, reducing the number of subjects in the continuous analysis to 76. The demographics of this subpopulation are given in Supplementary Table 1.

We see an improved accuracy of 72% compared with age and APOE alone at 58%. For information on the five metabolic features included in the final model see Table 3 . The addition of the protein FGG to the five-metabolic-feature model increased accuracy to 79%, with sensitivity and specificity both above 70% (71% and 84%, respectively). The two protein models (FGG and PPY only) gave an identical accuracy to the five-metabolic-feature model at 72%, driven by a high specificity (93%).\nPutative metabolite identification.

The metabolic feature with median m/z = 647.59 and an isotope (median m/z = 648.59) are likely to be anandamide (linoleoyl ethanolamide (2M+H)). 31 As expected, these isotopes are highly correlated (Pearson's correlation coefficient = 0.966).

We have used non-targeted metabolomics to predict NAB in subjects from the UCSF AD research center. We also present the first analysis to combine protein and metabolite data in the search for a biomarker for AD.\nWe found a panel of five metabolic features that predicted amyloid positivity with an accuracy of 72%. If the model specificity (76%) seen here is maintained in a replication study, it could be Blood metabolite markers of neocortical amyloid burden N Voyle et al useful in a screening setting where a large proportion of subjects would have high amyloid burden. As the metabolite panel correctly identified subjects with low amyloid levels, 76% of the time it could be useful in reducing the number of patients with low amyloid burden unnecessarily subjected to further procedures. Interestingly, no metabolic feature model retained age or APOE \u03b54 status. This population appeared relatively balanced with respect to these two variables, possibly accounting for the lack of inclusion. Alternatively, effects of age and APOE, which are well known to be associated with amyloid burden, could be accounted for in surrogate metabolic feature variables. 6, 7 Analysis of single metabolic features gave no significant results. However, low statistical power in the current study means that this approach should not be ruled out in further study of larger cohorts.\nWe were able to putatively identify four of the five metabolic features included in the model of dichotomized NAB. Of those identified, one was a phosphatidylcholine compound (PCaa 36:6). PCs are a group of compounds previously implicated in AD by Whiley et al. and others. 12, 15 In particular, PCaa 36:6 was included in the 10-lipid panel suggested by Mapstone et al. to predict conversion to amnestic MCI or AD with 90% accuracy. The association is in the opposite direction to that seen here, which could be explained by differences in disease stage between the cohorts. PCs are phospholipids that form a substantial component of biological membranes, and in this study show increased abundance in subjects with high NAB. Chung et al. state that PCs improve memory in mouse models, corresponding with the direction of association seen by Mapstone et al. 13 However, a Cochrane review has surmised that there is not sufficient evidence to extend this conclusion to humans. 33 We were able to test associations of PCaa 36:6 in the ADNI cohort. We saw a direction of association concurrent with that seen by Mapstone et al. but opposite to that seen in the UCSF cohort. 32 Subjects in the ADNI cohort are diagnostically more similar to those used by Mapstone et al., which could account for this similarity. Further, as we could only test the one metabolite, it is possible that this discrepancy is because we could not include the other four metabolites. ADNI is currently the only other cohort that has both metabolite and amyloid data available, and consequently this is the maximum extent of replication we can perform. It is essential that further attempts at replication are made in larger, independent studies.\nWe were also able to identify a PE (39:7). PEs are also a subtype of phospholipids that can be found in biological membranes. Interestingly, in humans they are largely found in tissues of the central nervous system and when methylated yield phosphatidylcholines. 34 PEs are also implicated in prion disease, where they cause aggregation of the prion protein. 35 In this study PE 39:7 was reduced in subjects with high NAB. PEs are also substrates for the synthesis of the final metabolic feature we were able to identify: anandamide. 36 Anandamide is an endogenous cannabinoid neurotransmitter that, on connection with receptors in the cell membrane, reduces the release of other neurotransmitters in the brain. 37 Anandamide is fat soluble, allowing it to pass through the blood-brain barrier and is made in areas of the brain important in memory. It is hypothesized that anandamide is involved in the creation and deletion of short-term connections between nerve cells. 38 In support of this theory, the presence of anandamide has been shown to impair memory in rats. 38 In this study anandamide is reduced in subjects with high NAB. This Figure 2 . Boxplots showing metabolic feature levels between high and low neocortical amyloid burden (NAB) groups for the five metabolic features included in the final model of dichotomized NAB. Student's t-test was used to generate a P-value.\nsupports findings by Jung et al. 39 who see an A\u03b2-dependent association of anandamide with cognitive decline in samples of brain tissue.\nThis study shows for the first time that the addition of candidate proteins (FGG and PPY) to metabolic feature models improves results. These results are promising and warrant further study while reinforcing the idea that a multi-modal approach may be more effective in AD biomarker discovery than single modality approaches.\nAlthough the results we present here are interesting, and we are reassured by the fact that the findings make biological sense, this study does have limitations-in particular, a lack of test data and the difference of direction of association for PCaa 36:6 in ADNI. Without a full independent test set it is likely that model statistics will be inflated, and therefore the results should be interpreted cautiously. Our preference would have been to split the data into a training and test set; however, the relatively small sample size made this suggestion infeasible. Instead, we choose to use a five-fold CV approach in this study. It is essential to validate this work in independent cohorts of a larger size, for example, in an asymptomatic cohort with high amyloid levels, to reflect the populations eligible for trials such as the A4 trial. 3 A further issue caused by small sample size is a lack of statistical power. This could be causing the substantial differences in R 2 seen in the continuous NAB analysis and provides further rationale for this work to be replicated in larger cohorts.\nA further limitation of this study is the confounding factor of diagnosis: the majority of subjects with high NAB have AD, whereas the majority of subjects with low NAB are diagnosed with fronto-temporal dementia. It is therefore impossible to tell whether the markers we identify here differentiate between high and low NAB or AD and fronto-temporal dementia. Both applications are important and interesting; however, it is vital that we aim to understand this confounding in future studies perhaps through similar analysis in an AD-only cohort.\nIn further research, targeted metabolite analysis would be beneficial. With an increased annotation, the biological understanding of any findings would grow, potentially deepening our knowledge of the disease mechanism of AD. Metabolite identification using the current methods is time-consuming, often inconclusive and can only be confirmed when the pure standard compounds are available. Further, the presence of annotated data would enable pathway analysis and more ready replication of findings. The data available in ADNI begin to work toward this."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "This study used metabolomic information to predict NAB in subjects from the UCSF AD Research Centre.
