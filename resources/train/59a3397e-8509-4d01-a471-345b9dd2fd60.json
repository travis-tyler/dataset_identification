Despite reliable, easy and widespread employment, appropriate normative values are still missing. We aim to provide norms for the Italian population.\nMethods: Two independent raters assigned the highest MTA and PA score between hemispheres, based on 3D T1-weighted MRI of 936 Italian Brain Normative Archive subjects (age: mean\u00b1SD: 50.2\u00b114.7, range: 20-84; MMSE>26 or CDR=0). The inter-rater agreement was assessed with the absolute intraclass correlation coefficient (aICC). We assessed the association between MTA and PA scores and sociodemographic features and APOE status, and normative data were established by age decade based on percentile distributions.\nRaters agreed in 90% of cases for MTA (aICC=0.86; 95% CI=0.69-0.98) and in 86% for PA (aICC=0.82; 95% CI=0.58-0.98). For both rating scales, score distribution was skewed, with MTA=0 in 38% of the population and PA=0 in 52%, while a score>2 was only observed in 12% for MTA and in 10% for PA. Median denoted overall hippocampal (MTA: median=1, IQR=0-1) and parietal (PA: median=0, IQR=0-1) integrity. The 90 th percentile of the age-specific distributions increased from 1 (at age 20-59) for both scales, to 2 for PA over age 60, and up to 4 for MTA over age 80. Gender, education and APOE status did not significantly affect the percentile distributions in the whole sample, nor in the subset over age 60.\nOur normative data for the MTA and PA scales are consistent with previous studies and overcome their main limitations (in particular uneven representation of ages and missing percentile distributions), defining the age-specific norms to be considered for proper brain atrophy assessment."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T"}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "In Alzheimer's disease (AD), neurodegeneration progresses from the hippocampus, towards the temporal lobes and the fronto-parietal associative areas, along with the underlying tauopathy, as demonstrated by neuropathological and neuroimaging studies (Braak H, Braak E, 1991; Marqui\u00e9 et al, 2017) . Atrophy of the medial temporal and parietal lobe is thus common, although not specific, of AD. Volumetric studies of these areas show a 10% volume decrease in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD (Chan et al, 2003; Frisoni et al, 2009 ) and a correlation of these volumes with the severity of cognitive impairment (Burke et al, 2018) . Consistently, hippocampal atrophy and parietal atrophy are significant predictors of progression from MCI to dementia, most frequently due to AD (DeCarli et al, 2007; Jack et al, 1999; Da et al, 2013; Pyun et al, 2017; Yao et al, 2012) . Thus, the usual employment of MRI with exclusionary role at the beginning of the diagnostic procedure can also have an inclusionary role to diagnose AD and related disorders.\nThe most informative volumetric measurements to this avail, requiring manual or semi-automated segmentation of the regions of interest, are time-consuming and require specific technical expertise.\nVisual rating scales allow a reliable but more feasible assessment of brain atrophy on MRI, mainly for clinical, but also research purposes (Scheltens et al, 1992; Koedam et al, 2011) . The medial temporal atrophy (MTA) scale assesses the width of the choroid fissure and of the temporal horn, as well as the height of the hippocampus; the posterior atrophy (PA) scale assesses the width of the posterior cingulate-and parieto-occipital sulci, and the atrophy of the parietal lobe and precuneus.\nThese scales demonstrated a similar accuracy in distinguishing healthy controls from subjects affected by dementia, especially due to AD, as automated measurement methods (Scheltens et al, 1992; Harper et al, 2016) ."}, {"section_title": "A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T", "text": "6 Different age-corrected cutoffs distinguishing AD dementia from normal aging were proposed, both for MTA (Scheltens et al, 1992; Pereira et al, 2014; Ferreira et al, 2015; Rhodius-Meester et al, 2017) and PA (Koedam et al, 2011; Ferreira et al, 2015; Rhodius-Meester et al, 2017) . Cut-off values increase with age, denoting that a certain degree of hippocampal and parietal atrophy may occur also in normal aging. The distribution of MTA and PA scores in normal subjects can be inferred from the control groups in clinical studies. In Scheltens' and Koedam's original papers, most control subjects (67% and 88%, respectively) had an atrophy score of 0 or 1. Similar distributions were reported in further studies (Pereira et al, 2014; Ferreira et al, 2015; Rhodius-Meester et al, 2017) , concluding that an MTA or PA score of 1 can be considered as normal.\nPopulation-based studies are unfortunately scarce. In 555 non-demented elderly individuals from the longitudinal study of aging \"Swedish National study of Ageing and Care in Kungsholmen\", aged between 60-97, Cavallin et al. (2012) confirmed that an MTA score of 0-1 is present in 95% of subjects aged 60-and 66-years old, a score of 0-2 in 98% of 72 and 78-years old, and a score of 0-3 in 99% of subjects over age 80. Consistently, a recent study in a homogeneous 75-year-old population-based cohort of 390 individuals from the \"Prospective Investigation of the Vasculature in Uppsala Seniors\", found that a MTA score \u22642 can be considered normal at the age of 75 (Velickaite et al, 2018) . However, these values are obtained from small size samples with arbitrarily homogeneous age ranges (i.e., only 60, 66, 72, 75, 78, 81, 84 , and over-87 years olds) (Cavallin et al, 2012; Velickaite et al, 2018) , and do not provide information on the percentile distribution of MTA scores. On the other hand, studies of PA normative distribution in population-based samples are still missing.\nThe normal shrinkage in hippocampus and parietal lobe is larger than any other brain structure in normal aging (Jernigan et al, 2001; Lemaitre et al, 2012; Thambisetty et al, 2010) , and may be modulated by specific confounders. To date, the reported relation between APOE genotype and the A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T 7 rate of volume loss is inconsistent in both brain regions (Soldan et al, 2015; Burggren et al, 2008; Chiang et al, 2011; Luo et al, 2017) . However, gender and education were associated to the degree of hippocampal atrophy, with higher MTA scores being observed in men and in subjects with higher education (Velickaite et al, 2018) .\nThe aim of this study was to establish normative data for the MTA and PA scales for the Italian population, considering the potential confounding role of gender, education and APOE genotype.\n10 discordant scores differed by only one point, mainly due to evaluations performed on adjacent slices by the raters, in many cases the final consensus was easily obtained choosing the slice in which atrophy was more evident and better assessable; in the other cases, the experienced reader was consulted. Percentile data were computed per decade on the consensual scores.\n14 seems to be particularly sensitive to the early pathological change (Frisoni et al , 1996) . Likewise, the fact that 38% of subjects score PA=1 supports the idea that a slight enlargement of the cortical sulci may be a common finding, probably related to physiological aging, as also observed in voxelbased morphometry studies (Lemaitre et al, 2012; Thambisetty et al, 2010) . The presence of high scores (up to 4) in our healthy subjects over age 80 confirms that MTA is not useful in distinguishing between healthy and cognitively impaired individuals in this age range, consistently with previous evidence (Claus et al, 2017) and daily clinical practice. Also etiological biomarkers have a lower informative value with increasing age (Jansen et al, 2015) . MTA retains diagnostic utility in younger age ranges, representing an important marker useful to support the presence of neurodegeneration plausibly related to Alzheimer's or related disorder.\nIn our sample, the association of MTA and PA with age, gender and education is also in line with previously reported data (Rhodius-Meester et al, 2017; Cavallin et al, 2012) . Older age was associated to higher scores for both scales (p<0.001), and thus higher 50 th and 90 th percentiles, reflecting age-related volumetric decline, known to affect mainly the hippocampal head (Jack et al, 1997) , the parietal lobe and precuneus (Bourisly et al, 2015) . In our study, gender did not affect MTA, although a trend for greater atrophy was observed in males in the last age decades taken into consideration. Velickaite et al (2018) recently reported a similar gender-related trend for MTA, but they also identified an interaction between gender and education, with lower scores in females with low education. We did not observe any interaction among the three confounders. On the other hand, gender showed a significant effect on PA in the whole sample, consistent with cortical morphometry studies showing greater levels of atrophy in men (Thambisetty et al, 2010) . However, comparisons by age groups failed to identify gender-specific percentile distributions, in agreement with what already reported by Ferreira et al (2015) . Associations between temporal and parietal volume measurements and confounders, such as gender and education, are reported in middle-aged\n15 and elderly populations (Rhodius-Meester et al, 2017; Cavallin et al, 2012; Velickaite et al, 2018; Thambisetty et al, 2010; Jiang et al, 2014) , but not in younger age ranges. This suggests that, in the last age decades, different rates of atrophy in specific subgroups should be kept in mind for a correct radiological assessment. The underlying presence of pathological aging, which remains clinically asymptomatic due to the compensatory effect of the individual brain reserve, as well as of anatomical variants or regional conformational anomalies, may contribute to these differences.\nTherefore, the normative values reported in this and in previous studies denote measures compatible with cognitive normality, but that do not necessarily correspond to the full brain health. On the other hand, using neurodegeneration biomarkers (CSF or PET) to exclude an underlying pathological aging (amyloidosis or tauopathy), and produce more robust norms, is questionable as to current clinical use and relative to current definitions of cognitive normality. Robust norms identify \"disease-free\" subjects not-representative of the general cognitively unimpaired population; on the other hand, such norms may be useful to identify pathological aging in the pre-clinical stage, and help define eligibility to possible disease-modifying treatments. Future research is warranted in this direction.\nThe prevalence of APOE-\u03b54 in our sample (19%) was similar to that reported in the Conselice Study of Brain Aging (15%), a previous Italian population-based survey conducted from 1999 to 2000 to measure dementia risk factors (Ravaglia et al, 2006) . The lack of significant differences of APOE-\u03b54 prevalence in subjects with scores below-versus those with score beyond the 90th percentile cut-offs, and the lack of differences among the two distributions failed to demonstrate any impact of APOE on MTA and PA per each age decade in the normal Italian population. As widely reported in the literature, the \u03b54 allele of APOE gene causes a dose-dependent increase in risk of developing AD (Corder et al, 1993) , and thus atrophy. However, the evidence concerning the effect of \u03b54 on hippocampal and parietal volume in healthy subjects, remains controversial, in\n16 particular in subjects over 40 (Espeseth et al, 2008) . Recently, a voxel-based morphometry study on cognitively healthy middle-aged subjects failed to detect significant APOE-associated volume differences in the hippocampus and in the parietal lobe (Ten Kate et al, 2016) , in accordance with our results.\nThe main limitation of this study consists in the use of a convenience sample, consisting of individuals who underwent MRI for neurological disturbances other than cognitive impairment.\nHowever, besides the demonstrated cognitive integrity, the convenience sample and the healthy volunteers subsample also included in our study were similar in all respects, assuring the representativity of the convenience sample. Further analyses with other populations are needed to confirm the supposed generalizability of these norms to other populations, in particular to the non-European ones, and to validate the 90 th percentile distributions in clinical samples.\nThe generation of normative values in samples known for being free of incipient neurodegeneration based on biomarker assessment may provide robust norms possibly allowing to detect dementing neurodegenerative disorders at earlier stages than current clinical standards. However, also these norms may have limitations. In fact, also biomarker-based cohorts may not be exempt from selection bias (e.g. age and education related to voluntary participation), as observed for the US ADNI cohort (Petersen et al, 2010) . In addition, the positivity to biomarker for neurodegenerative conditions is not necessarily associated to neither a present nor future development of cognitive disorders (Jansen et al, 2015) , and norms based on \"super-normals\", also known as \"robust norms\", would lead to an excessive number of false positives based on the current concept of clinical health."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study population and design", "text": "We collected data from the \"Italian Brain Normative Archive\", a study on normal brain aging performed between 2001 and 2008 at the IRCCS Istituto Centro San Giovanni di Dio-Fatebenefratelli, in Brescia (Riello et al, 2005; Galluzzi et al, 2009 (Folstein et al, 1975) (Table S1 ).

On the whole, this consistency in the data suggests that these normative values, although obtained exclusively from an Italian sample, can appropriately be used for other countries, especially the European ones.\nAs expected in a cognitively intact population, the scores distribution is markedly skewed. The high prevalence of subjects scoring MTA 1 suggests that a unilateral widening of the choroid fissure is a relatively common finding in the general population, possibly related to a physiological asymmetry in the rotation of the hippocampal head (Bronen and Cheung, 1991; Lucarelli et al, 2013) .
