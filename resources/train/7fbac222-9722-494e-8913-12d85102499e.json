[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "The Indian River Lagoon (IRL) USA is the most biologically diverse estuary in North America, supporting more than 2,200 species, including 35 listed as threatened or endangered. From a management perspective the lagoons is identified as an Estuary of National Significance, a State of Florida Surface Water Improvement and Management (SWIM) priority water body, contains three State Aquatic Preserves, and has been nominated as a National Estuarine Research Reserve. This estuarine system of coastal lagoons extends along 250 km of the Florida east coast (Figure 1). Watershed and lagoon conditions range from highly disturbed, near the cities of Melbourne and Vero Beach, to minimally disturbed, near Kennedy Space Center (KSC). The waters and local drainage basins around KSC are owned by NASA and managed by the US Fish and Wildlife Service as the Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge. The barrier island north of KSC is managed by the National Park Service as Canaveral National Seashore. Because healthy seagrass beds directly support high biological diversity and reflect good water quality, seagrasses are used by resource managers as a \"barometer\" of ecosystem health in the IRL. The majority of sport and commercial fisheries in the lagoon are dependent on seagrasses that directly support a regional fishery worth about one billion dollars a year (about $30,000/hectare of seagrass/year). 1 There are presently about 30,000 hectares of seagrass in IRL. Based on this value and inter-dependence, the St. Johns River Water Management District has set seagrass distribution and abundance targets, that will form the basis for future water quality management activities including definition of pollutant loading targets. 2,3 Targets will be set for nutrients, suspended solids, and freshwater with an ultimate goal of maintaining and improving the distribution and abundance of seagrasses. 4 Accurate seagrass maps provide a critical management tool. 2 Local resource managers have been mapping seagrass every 2-3 years since 1986. However, seagrass mapping in estuaries with turbid or colored water is difficult. 5,6 Seagrass maps are currently developed using the standard NOAA/C-CAP protocol. 7 This Sebastian Inlet study site procedure consists of aerial photos (true color, 1:24,000), followed by ground truthing, georectification, then visual photo interpretation, and manual drawing the outlines of seagrass polygons, labeling, and incorporation into a Geographic Information System (GIS). Despite continued improvements in this process, there are still serious inherent problems. These problems include:"}, {"section_title": "Cape C\u00e3\u00f1aver\u00e3l", "text": "(1) It is virtually impossible to distinguish seagrass from macroalgae in the aerial photographs. These large accumulations of macroalgae include both unattached drift macroalgae (e.g., Gracilaria sp.) that have 3 times the biomass of seagrass standing stock (unpublished; Virnstein and Carbonara, 1985) and attached macroalgae (e.g., Caulerpa prolifera) that typically cover many square kilometers of Lagoon bottom. (2) We can not distinguish seagrass species. (3) The turn-around time from aerial photography to finished GIS map has always been greater than one year. To address these and other issues we have initiated development of a seagrass mapping protocol that utilizes hyperspectral imagery as a principle data source. Information in the hyperspectral data cube may allow for improved definition of SAV bed constituents through investigation and eventual utilization of biochemical or biophysical based absorption and scattering features that influence the upwelling spectral signature. 6 Remote sensing of biochemical and biophysical components (species, taxonomic groups, plant health, etc.) may overcome limitations of traditional in-situ surveys that lack spatial coverage, resolution and precision required for sound management decisions. 6,8 A basic principle in remote sensing is that features of interest reflect or emit light in uniquely different ways and these differences can be detected and recorded by the remote sensing system. 9,10,11 Our experience has shown that one of the major issues hindering the scientific utility and application of hyperspectral data to resource mapping is the uncertainty or error that exists when attempting to link ground truth data with spectra extracted from pixels in the image cube. Hyperspectral images collected from aircraft using line scanning systems such as PHILLS or AISA often contain significant spatial error as a result of aircraft pitch, roll and yaw making direct comparisons between ground truth data and individual pixels difficult or even impossible. An example of this spatial error is shown in Figure 2. In that study, image based X, Y coordinates (latitude, longitude) developed with onboard GPS and inertial navigation systems differed from ground based GPS data and data derived from 1 m resolution digital ortho-photography by 5-10 m and in some areas by 50-100 m. Details of the study are given by Bostater. 6 Figure 2. Examples of spatial error found in hyperspectral imagery when georegistration is created using aircraft GPS and inertial navigation system records. In image a, the offset was 5 m to the north east. Off-set of 20 m southeast was observed in image b. These pixel location errors make comparisons between field collected ground truth data and image based spectral signatures difficult or impossible in aquatic environments."}, {"section_title": "a b", "text": "Off-set = 5 m GPS target Image location"}, {"section_title": "GPS target", "text": "Off-set = 20 m"}, {"section_title": "Image location", "text": "In this paper we describe a protocol implemented to collect spatially extensive field samples and hyperspectral data representative of the majority of conditions (water quality, depth, species assemblages, and sediment types) found in the IRL. These data will contribute to our scientific understanding of the utility of hyperspectral data for different levels of seagrass mapping and monitoring."}, {"section_title": "Approach", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Hyperspectral Data Collection", "text": "To assess the spatial variability that exists in the IRL we established 20 hyperspectral data acquisition flight lines distributed across the basin from north to south. In the area of Sebastian Inlet and the Sebastian River a 5 flight lines were established to give complete coverage of that region ( Figure 3). Hyperspectral data were collected with a SPECIM, AISA Eagle 1K hyperspectral sensor mounted on an MD500 helicopter. Flights were conducted in June 2004 during morning hours to minimize glint and waves resulting from afternoon sea breeze onset. Pixel size was 1.2 m 2 and spectral band width was 4.4 nm across the 396 -960 nm visible and near infrared region. The aerial data acquisition took 4 days to complete given weather and equipment issues.  "}, {"section_title": "Field Data Collection", "text": "A total of 26 target based ground truth transects were established in the IRL for collection of relevant data on SAV and water depth. Data collection variables are summarized in Table 1. These include position on transect, including left, middle and right plots at each meter, species density and distribution information, an index of epiphytic growth on the seagrass, density and distribution of macro-algae, total water depth, and depth to plant canopy.  Figure 4 displays the distribution of SAV transects at the Sebastian Inlet study area. Each end of the 40 m transect was marked with a 2 inch PVC pipe and 1 m 2 white target made from plywood and foam floatation material. A metric tape was used to measure the 40 m distance between the transect markers. Ground truth data were collected during the 10 days following the aerial survey. At each site the measuring tape was pulled tight between the PVC poles. SAV data were collected using three 1 m 2 PVC plot frames divided into one hundred 10 cm 2 grids. The middle frame was centered on the measuring tape at a starting point approximately 5 m from the target. This 5 m buffer was established to minimize bright target influences on the spectral signature of pixels within the transect. The left and right plot frames were then placed beside the middle frame and data collection was initiated. After all data were collected at the first location the frames were flipped forward to cover the next meter. This process was repeated 30 times producing 90 plot readings on each of the 26 transects for a total of 2340 readings.  Table 2 shows an example of data collected along Transect 19 as it appears in the Excel database. In this example, the actual values, averages and standard deviations are shown for each location where n = 3. This data layout allows for easy review, graph generation, and computation of simple summary statistics. Data can be moved to statistical analyses software packages for more rigorous analysis and ASCII files can be generated for use withy custom software.

Using the ENVI 4.2 grid tool the individual pixels are defined in the zoom window of the hyperspectral image ( Figure 6). After locating the white targets the annotation tool is used to place a line representing the 40 m transect etween the targets. The ENVI annotation tool is used to draw a rectangle that represents the 3 m by 30 m field transect placed between the targets allowing for the 5 m offset to minimize influences of pixel bleed over from the bright target. The ENVI measure tool is used to locate the transect 5 m from the target center. The screen image with the pixel grid and transect are then transferred into PowerPoint using screen capture (shift PrtScn). A graphic overlay is made of the transect polygon using the PowerPoint software drawing tools. The graphic overlay is placed in Excel using copy and past proceedure. The Excel data cell sizes are adjusted to mimic the pixel grid. The individual pixels for extraction are identified, color coded and numbered as shown in Figure 6. .

The annotation tool is used to draw the polygon defining the transect. PowerPoint is utilized to create a graphic overlay to fill the ENVI annotation tool generated transect. The overlay is then copied to Excel where it is used to identify and label the pixels for extraction of spectra from the hyperspectral imagery. Color coding is used to indicate pixels in more than one ground truth plot.

These ground truth data can then be used to development an enhanced mapping protocol that potentially will provide more detail than the existing system that relies on aerial photography. Results from transects 1,4, 11, 18, and 25 for depth, percent cover, total number of squares and algal biomass are shown in Figure 8 as an example of variability encountered. Across the Lagoon, SAV transect depths ranged between 10 cm and 230 cm. Transects 4 was placed on fairly level bottom averaging about 75 -80 cm across all locations. Transect 11, placed along the side of a dredge spoil disposal island transitioned slowly from 20 to 40 cm average depth. Transect 18, located in the tidally influenced area of Sebastian Inlet, averaged 55 cm across locations 1-15, rose rapidly to 20 cm then began declining into the inlet channel between meters 25 -30. Each transect in the study was unique in its depth profile. Plots of percent cover and numbers of squares having seagrass show the degree of variation encountered in the study. Transect 1 had very low SAV coverage that was sparsely distributed. In some cases transects crossed transitions or SAV bed edges. Transect 11 had 75% coverage across the first 20 meters with grass in 100 % of the plot squares. It then transitioned to less than 10 % cover and low density. Algal biomass was highest at transects 1 and 4 and lowest and transect 11. Drift algae tended to accumulate along the edge of seagrass beds but it also was frequently observed on and in the beds.  Displays example averaged field data from transect 19 and averaged reflectance spectra from 5 locations along the transect. Total depth and depth to canopy show a gradual decrease moving from meter 1 to meter 30. Drift algae density was low in the deeper water at transect locations 1-10, increased between meters 10 and 20, then decreased between meters 20 and 30. Total epiphyte load was high (4 -5) along the entire transect. Total SAV cover increased from around 40% to 70 % from the deep locations 1-5 to the shallow water at locations 25-30. Haloduli coverage was consistent at 15-20%. Syringodium coverage was 30 % at meters 1-5, increased to 50% at meters 15-20 and decreased back to 30% by meter 30. Thalasia was absent at meters 1-7, coverage increased to near 60% by meter 22 and remained high along the next 8 m. Extracted spectra displayed several interesting trends and features. Spectra from meters 1-3 displayed the highest reflectance values in the visible wavelengths and little in the 700 -750 nm area. This transect region had less than 40 % coverage of SAV and more than 80 cm of water above the canopy. The low SAV coverage is shown in Figure 7 as light pixels with san bottom influence. Absorption features are present in all spectra at about 550 nm and 605 nm indicating a potential response to the phycocyanin and phycoerythrin pigments in the drift algae and epihytes. 9 Reflectance in the 710 nm region increases consistently with increasing SAV density and reduce depths to canopy. "}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "The field data collection procedure was successful at providing a data set that represented the wide range of conditions in the Lagoon. The spectral extraction protocol developed as part of this hyperspectral image application evaluation represents a sound approach for linking reflectance spectra to the ground truth data collected at the pixel level in aquatic environments. The use of targets to mark the ends of ground truth transects eliminates issues associated with georeferencing and registration. Smaller targets could be utilized reducing the influences of bleed over to adjacent pixels, reducing cost and making handling easier. Orienting transects parallel or perpendicular to flight lines could further reduce uncertainty in linking ground truth data with spectra from the individual pixels by improving alignment and potentially minimizing mixed pixel influences. These results suggest additional analysis of the data set should be conducted to develop quantitative relationships between field data results and spectral signatures."}]
