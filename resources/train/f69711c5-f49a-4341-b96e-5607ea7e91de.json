[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The altimeter satellite TOPEX/POSEIDON was launched in August 1992. The primary objective of the TOPEX/POSEIDON mission is to study global ocean circulation. Part of this study involves an assessment of long-term global sea level change. The study of long-term sea level change requires the combination of altimeter data gathered by an array of altimeter satellites, like GEOS-3, SEASAT, GEOSAT, ERS-1, and TOPEX/POSEIDON. An absolute reference for all altimeter data is required. In order to achieve this, an accurate calibration of the altimeter instruments is necessary. An important step in the calibration of an altimeter measurement is a precise orbit determination. This report discusses the TOPEX/POSEIDON precise orbit determination close to the Harvest and Lampedusa veri cation sites. The precise orbits are used to calibrate the TOPEX altimeter instrument. TOPEX/POSEIDON is being tracked by a global network of DORIS Doppler and SLR (Satellite Laser Ranging) stations. In addition, TOPEX/POSEIDON is equipped with a high-precision GPS receiver and serves as a test bed for precise tracking by the Global Positioning System (GPS). TOPEX/POSEIDON orbits have been computed for several tracking combinations, SLRonly, Doppler-only, GPS-only, and SLR and Doppler combined. In some cases, satellite altimeter crossover di erences have also been used in the orbit computation. In general, the orbit is likely to be less constrained at the beginning and end of an orbital arc. Therefore, 1-day orbit arcs have been computed with the middle of the 1-day arc coinciding with the Harvest or Lampedusa over y. The TOPEX calibration based on 1-day orbit arcs will be compared with its calibration based on nominal 10-day orbit arcs to test the previous assumption. An important prerequisite for a precise orbit computation is the availability of a high-accuracy gravity eld model. Besides the JGM-1 and empirical tangential drag 2 per day, estimated periodic transverse acceleration 1 per day, estimated periodic normal acceleration 1 per day, estimated Dynamical model geopotential JGM-1, JGM-2, JGM-2Tx, GRIM-4C3 atmospheric drag DTM model solar radiation pressure earth radiation pressure dynamic solid earth tide dynamic ocean tide planetary perturbations thermal radiator (Y-bias) Table 1. TOPEX orbit computation JGM-2 gravity eld models, the JGM-2Tx and GRIM-4C3 have been used to study the sensitivity of the TOPEX calibration to the gravity eld. This report starts with a description of all the di erent TOPEX/POSEIDON orbits used to calibrate the TOPEX altimeter instrument. An accuracy assessment of these orbits will be presented. This will be followed by a description of the method used to incorporate these orbits in the TOPEX altimeter calibration and a discussion of the results. The TOPEX orbit analyses at the Harvest and Lampedusa calibration sites to be described hold for the rst 30 TOPEX repeat cycles. However, for the calibration at Lampedusa only enough tide gauge and altimeter data was available for cycles 4 and 7. For Harvest, this was the case for cycles 2,3,5,7,8,10,11,13,15,17,18,19, and 21 through 30. The TOPEX calibration results will be compared with altimeter bias estimates of ERS-1 and GEOSAT. This will be referred to as 'cross-calibration'."}, {"section_title": "TOPEX/POSEIDON orbits", "text": "The TOPEX/POSEIDON precise orbits have been computed with the UTOPIA program developed at the Center for Space Research (CSR) at the University of Texas (UT). Table 1 gives some information of the TOPEX orbit computation. Besides two empirical drag parameters per day, both 1-cpr (cycle per revolution) transverse and normal acceleration parameters are estimated. Di erent gravity eld models have been applied to study the in uence of gravity modeling on the TOPEX altimeter calibration. Drag and solar radiation models are applied. Perturbations by the planets are taken into account. Both the dynamic e ect of solid earth and ocean tides on the TOPEX orbit are modeled. In addition the e ect of asymmetric thermal radiation by TOPEX (referred to as Y-bias) is accounted for. The analysis started with the incorporation of 1-day SLR-only orbits using the JGM-1 gravity eld model in the estimation of the TOPEX altimeter bias. Some results of this orbit computation are listed in Table 2. For cycles 11 and 21 insu cient data was available. The accuracy of the TOPEX calibration is linearly dependent on the radial accuracy of the orbit determination. In order to be able to assess this radial accuracy, the rms of t of altimeter crossover di erences is also listed in Table 2 although in this case these crossover di erences have not been used in the orbit computation. For all results to be discussed, residual altimeter crossover di erences with an absolute value greater than 35 cm are edited. The rms of t of the altimeter crossover di erences is computed by subtracting the computed orbit height above the reference ellipsoid (semi-major axis a e = 6378136.3 m, attening = 1./298.257) from the altimeter measurements and by applying all available corrections to the altimeter measurements, including instrument corrections, ionospheric and tropospheric delay corrections, solid earth and ocean tide corrections, and an inverse barometric correction. This correction was obtained from the following equations: press = (1000:0 drytrp)=(2:277 (1: + 0:0026 cos(2 ))) barcor = (?9:948 (press ? 1013:3))=10:0 (1) where press is the local atmospheric pressure (mbar), drytrp the dry tropospheric correction (cm), the geodetic latitude (radians), and barcor the inverse barometric correction (cm). No signi cant wave height (SWH) correction has been applied. The rms of t for the SLR residuals ranges from 1.2 to 5.1 cm, where this rms of t is de ned as the weighted rms of the SLR residuals. In the computation of this rms, all SLR residuals are weighted by a station dependent standard deviation. The rms of t for the crossover residuals are on the order of 10 cm, indicating an upper bound of 7 cm for the rms of the TOPEX radial orbit errors. However, this 10 cm is a sum of radial orbit errors, tide modeling errors, ocean surface variability, and altimeter measurement correction errors. It is therefore expected that the TOPEX radial orbit error is below 7 cm and is on the order of 3-5 cm. However, for cycle 13 at the Harvest over y, the crossover di erence residual rms is equal to 14.2 cm. For the selected 1-day period in cycle 13 only a sparse SLR tracking data set is available accounting for this rather high crossover rms. Besides nominal 1-day SLR-only JGM-1 orbits, 1-day SLR-only JGM-1 orbits have been computed for which the weight of SLR stations that track TOPEX/POSEIDON in the time interval, beginning 15 min before the calibrate site over y and that ends 15 min after, has been increased by a factor 100. In this way, the orbit is 'tied' to the SLR tracking stations positioned close to the calibration site. The question that has to be addressed is whether this approach leads to a more accurate orbit close to the calibration sites. Results of this orbit computation are listed in Table 3. In this case, converged orbits could not be obtained for cycles 11, 17, 19 and 21. The rms of t of both SLR measurements and altimeter crossover di erences has increased signi cantly compared to the values listed in Table 2 (in fact, many crossover di erences were edited, because its residual was above the 35-cm threshold). However, it was found that the rms of t of the SLR measurements of the SLR tracking stations close to the calibration sites was decreased, indicating that the overall accuracy of the 1-day orbit may be less, but the accuracy of the orbit close to the calibration sites may be higher. Also shown in Table 3 is the number of SLR tracking stations that have been assigned a higher weight. It may be argued that by increasing the weight of the stations close to Harvest or Lampedusa the orbit computation begins to approach a geometric orbit determination. However, for a geometric orbit determination at least 3 simultaneously tracking SLR stations are necessary. Table 3 shows that this has only been the case for cycles 2,3,7,8,10,24,29 Figure 1. TOPEX/POSEIDON SLR tracking station network at Harvest. Also indicated are the ground track of TOPEX/POSEIDON and 15 visibility circles the Harvest and Lampedusa over ies. Comparing Figures 1 and 2 it may be concluded that the geometry of SLR tracking stations at Lampedusa is more favorable for a high-accuracy calibration of the TOPEX altimeter. Moreover, SLR stations are located on both the Eastern and Western sides of the ground track and on both the Northern and Southern side of Lampedusa island. Only 6 SLR tracking stations are adjacent to Harvest and all of them are located on the Western or Northern side of the ground track, except for the SLR station designated by HOLLAS. However, Harvest is located outside the visibility circle of this station. In addition, analyzing the ground track patterns close to Harvest and Lampedusa, it can be seen that altimeter measurements will be available only before the Harvest over y, whereas for Lampedusa they will be available both directly before and after the over y. In the ideal situation, the TOPEX altimeter measures exactly above the tide gauge. However, in reality the altimeter measurements have to be interpolated to this location or to the location along the ground track which is the closest to the tide gauge. For Harvest, positioned close to the land, this becomes more of an extrapolation rather than an interpolation. It is therefore anticipated that a more consistent calibration of TOPEX can be done at Lampedusa. Unfortunately, at the moment only for two Lampedusa over ies are all data  necessary for a proper calibration available, so that it is di cult to prove the previous assumption. In addition to a network of SLR tracking stations, a network of DORIS Doppler stations is available to track TOPEX/POSEIDON. The Doppler measurement is basically a range-rate measurement or a measurement of the change in range of a satellite to the ground station in a certain time interval. The Doppler measurements have been used to compute 1-day JGM-1 orbits. Results of the orbit computation are listed in Table 4. For cycle 10 at the Harvest over y no DORIS Doppler data was available, and for cycle 7 at the Lampedusa over y not enough DORIS Doppler tracking data was available to support a stable 1-day orbit determination. The rms of t of the Doppler measurements is on the order of 0.55 mm/s and the rms of t of altimeter crossover di erences ranges from 5.8 to 11.3 cm, with the exception of a deviating 19.4 cm for the non-converged orbit for cycle 7 at Lampedusa. Remarkable is the rms of t of 5.8 cm for cycle 8. Comparing these results with the results listed in Table 2, it may be concluded that the radial accuracy of the Doppler-only orbits is comparable to the radial accuracy of the SLR-only orbits. Unfortunately, both the Doppler and SLR tracking is rather sparse for the selected 1-day periods in cycle 11. This may lead to an unreliable estimate of the TOPEX altimeter bias for this cycle.  Table 4. Statistics of 1-day Doppler-only JGM-1 orbits centered at the Harvest (H) and Lampedusa (L) over y An experiment was conducted in which 1-day orbits were computed based on SLR data, with increased weight for the SLR observations close to the Harvest over y, and Doppler data. Results are listed in Table 5. Compared to the orbits without the Doppler data Table 3), the overall rms of the SLR and crossover di erence residuals has improved signi cantly, whereas compared to the nominal 1-day SLR-only orbits ( Table 2) the rms of the SLR residuals close to the Harvest/Lampedusa over ies has been decreased. In addition, a stable orbit could be computed for more cycles. Besides SLR and Doppler tracking, TOPEX/POSEIDON is being tracked by GPS. For cycle 10, a 1-day GPS-only JGM-1 orbit centered at the Harvest over y was computed. This orbit was compared with the 1-day SLR-only JGM-1 orbit. The rms of the radial, along-track and cross-track position di erences is equal to respectively 3.3, 12.6 and 24.2 cm, and the mean to respectively 0.3, 0.0, and 0.6 cm. The rms of t of 71 altimeter crossover di erences is equal to 7.9 cm, compared to 8.6 cm for the SLR-only orbit. In order to overcome a possible sparse tracking by SLR and/or DORIS Doppler stations, orbits have been computed using both SLR data and altimeter crossover di erences. Also orbits have been computed based on all available observations, thus combining SLR measurements, Doppler measurements and altimeter crossover di erences. Results are listed in Tables 6 and 7. Analyzing these Tables, it may be concluded that the incorporation of altimeter crossover di erences in the orbit computation hardly changes the rms of t of the SLR and Doppler measurements. However, if the SLR and/or Doppler tracking is sparse, the inclusion of altimeter crossover di erences in the orbit computation leads to a more stable orbit computation. However, the addition of crossover data to the SLR data alone was not enough to support a stable orbit computation for cycles 11 and 21. Because gravity is the major force driving the TOPEX/POSEIDON orbit, di erent gravity eld models have been used in the orbit computation. Four di erent gravity eld models have been used in computing 1-day orbits based on both SLR measurements and altimeter crossover di erences. Besides JGM-1, JGM-2, JGM-2Tx, and the less-accurate GRIM-4C3 gravity eld models have been used. Comparing the results listed in Tables 6 and 8, it can be concluded that the overall performance of the JGM-2 gravity eld model is a little bit better than of JGM-1. The rms of t of the SLR measurements has slightly decreased. The same is true for the peak values of the rms of t of the altimeter crossover di erences. The overall results using the JGM-2Tx gravity eld model (Table 10) are even better. Analyzing the results listed in Table 11, it may be concluded that the orbits computed with the GRIM-4C3 are of inferior quality, with an rms of t of the SLR measurements as high as 12.6 cm and of the altimeter crossover di erences as high as 18.3 cm, with several crossover di erences edited. Table 9 shows statistics for 1-day JGM-2 orbits using SLR, Doppler and crossover data. Compared to Table 7, the results listed in this Table again show the generally slightly better performance of the JGM-2 gravity eld model as compared to JGM-1. So far, only 1-day orbits have been discussed for which the middle coincides with the Harvest or Lampedusa over y, because it is expected that the orbit is constrained most in the middle of the orbital arc. To be able to con rm the previous assumption, TOPEX altimeter bias estimates have been computed based on nominal 10-day orbits computed at UT/CSR. These orbits are based on both SLR and Doppler measurements and the gravity eld used was JGM-2. Results of these orbit computations are listed in Table 12. The rms of t of the SLR measurements ranges from 3.4 to 6.4 cm. For the Doppler measurements the rms of t ranges from 0.51 to 0.58 mm/s, and for the altimeter crossover di erences from 9.6 to 11.4 cm. Comparing these results with the results of the 1-day JGM-1/JGM-2 orbits listed in Tables 2-10, it may be concluded that the overall accuracy of the 10-day orbits is of the same order of magnitude as the accuracy of the 1-day orbits, with a slight  Table 12. Statistics of 10-day JGM-2 orbits using both SLR and Doppler data increase in the rms of t of the SLR measurements. However, the question that has to be answered is which orbits are the most accurate in the radial direction at the Harvest and Lampedusa over ies. This question will be addressed in the next Section."}, {"section_title": "TOPEX altimeter bias estimation", "text": "The altimeter measurements used in the analysis described in this report consist of 1-sec normal points and have been derived from the Geophysical Data Records (GDR) delivered by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). In the ideal case, a satellite altimeter measurement is equal to the computed instantaneous distance between the satellite's center of mass and the ocean surface. However, the measurement is subject to many disturbances and corrections which have to be accounted for. The basic altimetry equation reads Tapley et al., 1982;Zandbergen, 1990 The left-hand side h represents the distance between the satellite's center of mass and a suitably selected reference ellipsoid and follows from a precise orbit computation. As indicated before, several orbits have been computed and the in uence of the orbit computation on the estimate for the altimeter bias h bias will be studied. The actual measurement is represented by h, with a value of about 1350 km for TOPEX and a measurement noise level of 2-5 cm. The measurements have to be corrected for the position o set of the altimeter instrument from the satellite's center of mass: h com . This value can be determined accurately before launch. Furthermore, corrections have to be applied to account for instrumental delays: h i . These corrections are on the order of a few decimeters, with sub-decimeter accuracy. The correction term h a represents atmospheric path length delays, i.e. the altimeter measurement has to be reduced by this correction. This term can be divided into a dry tropospheric correction, on the order of 2.3 m with an error of 1-2 cm, a wet tropospheric correction, usually lower than 30 cm with an error of 1-4 cm, and an ionospheric correction, usually lower than 20 cm with an error of 1-3 cm. An additional instrument correction, h s , has to be applied to account for the interaction between the radar pulse and the ocean surface (electromagnetic bias). This correction may be related to the so-called signi cant wave height (SWH). This SWH is on the order of a few meters, but in extreme circumstances the SWH may be as large as 20 m. The error of this correction is on the order of 1 % of the SWH, i.e. 1-20 cm. However, on the average the SWH will be below 4 m, thus the error of the correction will be below 4 cm. In fact, it was found that the SWH-value at Harvest ranged from 1.8 to 3.6 m and at Lampedusa from 0.5 to 1.0 m. Thus a 1 % error in the SWH-correction can cause a 0.5 to 3.6 cm error. The geoid height and the heights induced by the solid-earth and ocean tides are represented by respectively h g and h t . Finally, h 0 represents the ocean topography, which is the elevation of the ocean surface above the geoid, as caused primarily by ocean currents. This ocean topography consists of a semi-permanent and a variable part. The sum of h g , h t and h 0 , in the following denoted as the instantaneous sea level, has been measured in situ. This was done in the following way. First, the position of GPS markers at Harvest and Lampedusa was determined with high precision by a GPS campaign, and the positions of tide gauge instruments at these sites were determined relative to the GPS markers. This resulted in the geodetic coordinates listed in Table 13. The instantaneous sea level at a Harvest or Lampedusa over y by TOPEX/POSEIDON is obtained by adding the tide gauge reading to the height above the reference ellipsoid of the tide gauge marker. If all these corrections are applied, the remaining altimeter measurement residual gives an estimate of the altimeter bias h bias . The previous description of the altimeter measurement, its corrections and the accuracy assess-ment of these corrections hold for a global analysis. In fact, the errors in the altimeter measurement corrections at Harvest and Lampedusa are expected to be smaller TOPEX/POSEIDON Joint Verication Team, 1992]. The total altimetry error (including tide gauge reading, excluding orbit error) is divided into a xed and variable part. At Harvest, the xed altimetry error is estimated to be 1.8 cm and the variable error 3.6 cm for a single over ight. For Lampedusa, no number has been specied for the xed error, the variable altimetry error is estimated to be 2.3/2.9 cm (Summer/Winter). In the calibration, besides altimeter measurement correction errors, errors in the coordinates of the veri cation site have to be taken into account. For Harvest, the xed error is estimated to be 2.1 cm, mostly GPS survey error, and the variable error 1.2 cm. The variable error is caused by the exibility in the Harvest tower. For Lampedusa, only a xed error equal to the GPS survey error is speci ed, equal to 0.45 cm. Finally, as indicated in the previous Section, the altimeter measurements have to be interpolated to the position along the ground track which is the closest to the Harvest or Lampedusa calibration sites (Table 13). In the analysis of the IGDR data it was found that the largest distance between the point of closest approach on the ground track and Harvest or Lampedusa was equal to respectively 1080 and 140 m. The slope of the geoid in the relevant direction as computed from the OSU91A geoid Rapp et al., 1991] was found to be 0.34 and 1.1 cm/km at Harvest and Lampedusa respectively. Thus these slopes can introduce bias estimation errors of less than 4 mm. Summing the previous error estimates, the total calibration errors at Harvest and Lampedusa become 2.8/3.8 (cm) (Fixed/Variable) and 0.45/2.3/2.9 (Fixed/Variable-Summer/Variable-Winter). Thus, the total error (Fixed+Variable) becomes 4.7 (cm) at Harvest and 2.4/3.0 (cm) (Summer/Winter) at Lampedusa, for a single over ight. Added to these numbers must be the radial orbit error at Harvest or Lampedusa. After applying all instrument corrections, and ionospheric and tropospheric delay corrections to the altimeter measurements, an altimeter height residual ( h) is obtained after subtracting the orbit and geoid heights from these corrected altimeter measurements. The geoid height has been subtracted in order to obtain residuals with a low absolute power. In this way it is expected that the interpolation errors will be small. The altimeter height residual is represented by (sea also equation 2): h = h ? h + h com + h i + h a + h s + h g (3) The estimate for the altimeter bias is obtained by rst adding the geoid height (h g ) to the altimeter height residual and then subtracting the height of the tide gauge marker (Table 13) and the tide gauge reading. Altimeter measurements within 60 sec (about 430 km) of the calibration site over y have been selected and used in the interpolation. This means for Harvest a total number of about 60 altimeter measurements, and for Lampedusa about 120. The interpolation applied is based on the concept of least-squares collocation Moritz, 1980]. The interpolation can be represented by: where h int is the interpolated altimeter height residual, h the vector of altimeter height residuals computed from the selected altimeter measurements, C st the row of covariances between h int and h, C tt the covariance matrix of h, and D a diagonal matrix whose elements are equal to the measurement standard deviation. The measurement standard deviation was estimated to be 5 cm. The covariances were computed using an exponential covariance function: ( h 1 ; h 2 ) = Ae ?( = ) 2 (5) where is the distance in location between h 1 and h 2 , and the correlation length equal to about 11 km (0.1 ), of the same order of magnitude as the distance of 7 km between two successive altimeter measurements. The amplitude A was chosen equal to 1 m 2 to re ect the magnitude of the altimeter height residuals. The previously described method has been applied rst to estimate bias estimates from the Harvest over ies using the 10-day JGM-2 SLR/Doppler orbits. For Harvest, two sets of tide gauge readings are available, referred to as NOAA and CU tide gauge measurements and it had to be decided which data set to use for all the other cases. The NOAA tide gauge measurements are 6 min averages, and are obtained by one downward looking acoustic sensor. The NOAA tide gauge value at the over y is obtained by linearly interpolating between the two NOAA 6 min tide gauge values closest to the time of the over y. Instead, the CU tide gauge measurements are listed as about 1 per second data. These measurements can uctuate by more than 30 cm in one second. Therefore, an averaging scheme is applied in which a rectilinear line is tted through 10 min of CU-tide gauge measurements, between 5 minutes before and after the over y. This line is then evaluated at the over y time to deliver the tide gauge value to be used in the calibration. For Lampedusa, only 1 set of 2 min average tide gauge measurements is available. This data sets shows that the Mediterranean close to Lampedusa is much more quiet than the Paci c close to harvest. The tide gauge value at the Lampedusa over ies is simply obtained by a linear interpolation between the two tide gauge values closest in time to the over y. Harvest bias estimates using both CU and NOAA tide gauge measurements are listed in Table 14. Indicated are also the mean and rms about mean ( ) of the bias estimates. For cycle 27 no CU tide gauge value was available. Therefore cycle 27 is excluded in the computation of the mean and rms about mean of the bias estimates. Using the NOAA tide gauge measurements leads to a mean bias estimate equal to -17.4 with an rms about mean of 4.82 cm. Using the CU tide gauge measurements, these values are respectively -18.4 and 4.33 cm. Considering these numbers, the CU tide gauge values seem to be slightly more reliable than the NOAA values. Especially when looking at the bias estimates for the rst 22 cycles, the CU tide gauge values seem to be more reliable. For cycle 18, the NOAA and CU tide gauge measurements at the over y di er more than 12 cm. If this cycle is not taken into account, the mean bias estimate using CU and NOAA tide gauge measurements becomes respectively -18.3 and -17.8 cm, with values for the rms about mean of 4.40 and 4.57 cm. For cycles after 22, the NOAA and CU tide gauge values agree very well, to within -1.8 to 1.0 cm. Therefore, it was decided to use the CU tide gauge values in the following for the Harvest over ies, and to use the NOAA tide gauge values for cycle 27 only. The bias estimation procedure has led to TOPEX altimeter bias estimates as listed in Tables  15 and 16. All the estimates listed in Table 15 hold for 1-day JGM-1 orbits. The open spaces or the values between brackets indicate outliers, either caused by problems in the orbit computation (orbits that did not converge) or by other problems, possibly errors in the tide gauge values or errors in the altimeter measurement corrections. These values are not used in the computation of the mean and rms about mean. For the SLR-only (I) orbits the average of the Harvest bias estimates is equal to -15.8 cm with an rms about mean of 2.99 cm. For Lampedusa these numbers are respectively -23.1 and 5.49 cm. However, only 2 Lampedusa bias estimates have been made and it is therefore di cult to compute a reliable number for the rms about mean. As shown in Table  15, the mean of the Harvest bias estimates ranges from -15.8 cm for the SLR-only (I) to -19.8 for the SLR-only orbits with increased weight of the SLR stations close to the Harvest over y (III). All these values are within twice the computed rms about mean. The lowest rms about mean, 2.72 cm, was found for SLR/Crossover orbits (V).  Table 14. TOPEX altimeter bias estimates at Harvest based on 10-day SLR/Doppler JGM-2 orbits. Two di erent tide gauge systems are compared cm. The Lampedusa mean bias estimates range from -21.1 for orbits designated (III) to -25.6 for the Doppler-only orbits. The di erence between the mean of the Lampedusa bias estimates and the mean of the Harvest bias estimates is between 2.3 and 8.5 cm, which is always smaller than 3 times the rms about mean of the Harvest bias estimates. These di erences are also of the same order of magnitude as the estimated error budget for calibrating the TOPEX altimeter at Harvest and Lampedusa. It is therefore concluded that the Harvest results are in close agreement with the Lampedusa results. The values for the mean and rms about mean discussed above hold for di erent values for the number of cycles. Therefore, included in Table 15 are values for the mean and rms about mean for the same 15 cycles for each case. These cycles are 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 13, 15, 18, 22, 23, 25, 27, 28, 29 and 30. These values are denoted by (H,*). As can be seen in Table 15, the statistics do not change much. The lowest rms about mean is still obtained for the SLR/Crossover orbits (V), 2.81 cm. Table 15 further shows that an approach in which high weights are applied to SLR observations close to the over y does not improve the bias estimation (cases (III) and (IV)). This can be explained by the changing geometry of the SLR tracking stations that actually tracked TOPEX close to the over y. As can be seen in Table 3 the number of these stations varies from 0 to 4. This has as a result a di erent weighting of possible station coordinate errors for each cycle and might introduce additional variability in the bias estimates. In addition, as indicated in the previous Section, all SLR tracking stations are located east of the ground track and this asymmetry might introduce orbit errors. One bias estimate not included in Table 15 is an estimate based on a 1-day GPS-only JGM-1 orbit for cycle 10. This bias estimate is equal to -27.3 cm, in close agreement with the other bias estimates for cycle 10. With gravity being the major force driving the TOPEX/POSEIDON orbit, di erent gravity eld models were used in the orbit computation. Bias estimates based on the di erent orbits obtained using respectively the JGM-2, JGM-2Tx and GRIM-4C3 gravity eld models are listed in Table 16. Both SLR tracking and altimeter crossover di erences have been used in computing these orbits. The mean of the Harvest bias estimates for these orbits ranges from -17.1 to -18.2, with a rather high rms about mean for the GRIM-4C3 orbits. It has been shown that with even the use of a less accurate gravity eld model (GRIM-4C3), the mean bias estimate remains about the same. The lowest rms about mean of the bias estimates for the SLR/Crossover orbits holds for the case where the JGM-2 gravity eld model has been used: 2.54 cm, although this value is close to the values using JGM-2Tx and JGM-1 (Table 15), respectively 2.68 and 2.72 cm. The Lampedusa bias estimates are in close agreement with the Harvest bias estimates. Taking only the 15 selected cycles, the rms about mean for the 1-day JGM-2 SLR/Crossover orbits is 2.68 cm, with a value of -17.8 cm for the mean. Finally, included in Table 16 are bias estimates based on nominal 10-day JGM-2 SLR/Doppler orbits. The rms about mean of the Harvest bias estimates, 2.70 cm, compares very well with the rms about mean for the most accurate 1-day orbits. The mean, -18.9 cm, is still in close agreement with the other listed values. For Lampedusa, the mean of the bias estimates is -22.1 cm, within twice the rms about mean of the Harvest estimates. The latter results indicate that only minor improvements in the bias estimates can be expected if instead of the nominal 10-day JGM-2 SLR/Doppler TOPEX orbits 1-day orbits are computed. Most values for the rms about mean of the mean altimeter bias estimates are comparable to (and sometimes even smaller than) the estimates of the variable calibration errors at Harvest, 3.8 (cm), and Lampedusa, 2.3/2.9 (cm) (Summer/Winter). As mentioned before, in the computation of these values possible orbit errors were not taken into account.   4 Cross calibration TOPEX/POSEIDON is only one in an array of altimeter satellites. This opens the possibility of a so-called cross calibration between the TOPEX altimeter and other altimeters. The TOPEX bias estimate has been compared with bias estimates of the GEOSAT and ERS-1 altimeters. As a reference, the Harvest TOPEX bias estimate with the lowest rms about mean, 2.54 cm (Table 16), will be used in the cross calibration. The cross calibration has been performed by the following procedure. First, residual sea heights have been computed. These residual sea heights can be represented as: h = h ? h + h com + h i + h a + h s + h g + h t + h SST 6In fact, the residual sea heights can be obtained by subtracting the solid earth and ocean tide corrections from the altimeter residuals equation 3, and by subtracting the height of the dynamic sea surface topography h SST . This dynamic sea surface topography is computed using the JGM2.SST T model complete to degree and order 25 CSR, priv. comm.]. The JGM-2 gravity eld model complete to degree and order 70 was used to compute the geoid heights h g . The residual sea heights were used to compute altimeter normal points. Altimeter normal points have been computed from ERS-1 IGDR's, GEOSAT GDR's and TOPEX GDR's. Altimeter normal points were computed by tting a straight line to corrected 1 per second measurements in 10 second windows. A normal point was edited if less than 4 measurements were present in a 10 seconds window or if the rms of t of these measurements to the straight line was greater than 0.15 cm. In addition, normal points were edited if the absolute value of the high-frequency geoid height was larger than 2.0 m. The high-frequency geoid was computed using the OSU91A geoid model above degree 70 Rapp et al., 1991]. The normal points were corrected using this high-frequency geoid. Normal points were also edited if the geoid gradient was above 5.0 m/degree, the depth of the ocean at the subsatellite point was smaller than 500 m, and if the absolute value of the di erence between the mean surface and the OSU91A geoid was larger than 1.5 m. Finally, normal points were edited if no tide information was available and if the normal point was located in an area with high sea surface variability. In the normal point computation, the best available ERS-1 JGM-2 orbits at CSR were used, with a residual altimeter crossover di erence rms of about 16 cm. For TOPEX, the operational 10-day Doppler/SLR JGM-2 orbit (Table 12) was used, and for GEOSAT the best available CSR TEG-2B orbits were used, with a crossover rms of about 16 cm. Altimeter normal points were computed from 3 3.5-day periods of ERS-1 data (04/14/92-04/25/92), from 1 cycle of TOPEX data (cycle 10 from 12/21/92 to 12/31/92), and from 1 cycle of GEOSAT data (cycle 4 from 12/29/86-01/15/87). This resulted in 22,430 altimeter normal points for ERS-1, 38,295 for TOPEX, and 57,210 for GEOSAT. The mean of these altimeter normal points, in the following referred to as global mean, are listed in Table 17. The mean is equal to -56.0, -35.2, and -11.4 for ERS-1, TOPEX, and GEOSAT, respectively. It must be noted that in the computation of these values the inverse barometric correction was applied. No SWH corrections were applied. An analysis of single satellite ERS-1, TOPEX and GEOSAT altimeter crossover di erences indicate SWH corrections equal to 1.8 %, 0.0 % and 2.3 % respectively. The global mean of the SWH-values on the used ERS-1, TOPEX and GEOSAT data is equal to respectively 2.66, 2.51 and 2.51 m. A column is added to Table 17 showing the e ect of these SWH corrections. The mean is now equal to respectively -60.8, -35.2, and -17.1 cm for ERS-1, TOPEX and GEOSAT. These values are relative to a reference ellipsoid with a semi-major axis equal to 6378136.3 m. no SWH corr.

Global analysis of altimeter normal points Second, the altimeter biases computed at veri cation sites are listed in Table 18. As mentioned before, the Harvest value with the lowest rms about mean has been taken, equal to -17.7 cm. For ERS-1, the bias estimated at the Venice tower, equal to -40.9 cm Scharroo et al., 1991;Wakker et al.,1991], has been taken. If a SWH correction is applied these values are respectively -42.4 and -17.7 cm. The SWH-corrected altimeter bias estimates at the veri cation sites were obtained by using the actual SWH values at Harvest for TOPEX (although the SWH correction for TOPEX is equal to 0.0 % and in this case the altimeter bias estimates for TOPEX did not change). From TOPEX data it was computed that the mean of the SWH in the Mediterranean is about 0.82 m. This value was used to correct the ERS-1 bias estimate at the Venice tower. The GEOSAT altimeter has not been calibrated, but a value for the GEOSAT bias can be obtained by a cross calibration between ERS-1 and GEOSAT or TOPEX and GEOSAT. If it is assumed that the semi-major axis of the Earth is constant, for each satellite the mean from the global analysis (Table 17) minus the value obtained at the veri cation sites (Table 18) must be the same. In that case the GEOSAT altimeter bias becomes 3.7 cm (no SWH correction) and 1.3 cm (including SWH correction) when 'cross calibrating' with ERS-1. When cross-calibrating with TOPEX these numbers become 6.1 and 0.4 cm. Thus, the discrepancy between TOPEX and ERS-1 is 2.4 cm if no SWH correction is applied and only 0.9 cm if the SWH correction is applied. These discrepancies are smaller than the rms about mean of the best Harvest TOPEX bias estimate. Third, residual dual satellite altimeter crossover di erences, in the following referred to as duals, have been computed, 10,557 for ERS-1/TOPEX and 16,494 for ERS-1/GEOSAT, using the same time spans as described above. Also in the computation of these residuals, the inverse barometric correction was applied. The mean of these residuals was computed, equal to respectively -20.8 and -45.5 cm if no SWH corrections are applied. If SWH corrections are applied, these numbers are respectively -26.1 and -44.7 cm. In principle, the di erence between the bias estimates of two radar altimeters at the veri cation sites must be equal to the di erence in the global mean values. In addition, this di erence must be equal to the mean of the duals. All these 'di erence' values have been listed in Table 19. For ERS-1/TOPEX, these di erences are equal to respectively -23.2, -20.8, and -20.8 cm if no SWH correction is applied (a maximum discrepancy of 2.4 cm), and -24.7, -25.6 and -26.1 cm if the SWH corrections are applied (a maximum discrepancy of 1.4 cm). For ERS-1/GEOSAT the di erence in the global mean and the mean of the duals is equal to respectively -44.6 and -45.5 cm if no SWH correction is applied (a discrepancy of 0.9 cm) and -43.7 and -44.7 cm if the SWH corrections are applied (a discrepancy of 1.0 cm). The maximum discrepancy for all cases is 2.4 cm, about equal to no SWH correction (cm) SWH correction applied (cm) Bias ERS-1 -40.9 -42.4 Bias  Bias GEOSAT cross cal. with ERS-1 3.7 1.3 cross cal. with TOPEX 6.1 0.4 Table 18.

Comparison between global analysis, bias estimates at veri cation sites, and dual satellite altimeter crossover di erences the rms about mean of the selected mean Harvest bias estimate. It has been indicated before that besides a variable error also a xed error of a few cm's may be made in the TOPEX calibration at Harvest. This error must be added to the rms about mean. Therefore, it is concluded that the results for ERS-1, TOPEX and GEOSAT are in very close agreement with each other."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "TOPEX/POSEIDON orbits have been computed using di erent gravity eld models, di erent combinations of tracking data and altimeter crossover di erences, and for di erent orbital arc lengths. Besides the JGM-1 gravity eld model, JGM-2, JGM-2Tx (including TOPEX/POSEIDON SLR and Doppler tracking of the rst 10 10-day repeat cycles), and GRIM-4C3 have been used. Both 1-day orbits centered at the Harvest and Lampedusa over ies and 10-day orbits orbits have been computed. Residual altimeter crossover di erence statistics indicate a radial orbit error much less than 7 cm, except for the less accurate GRIM-4C3 orbits with an estimated radial orbit accuracy worse than 10 cm. Mean bias estimates (based on at least two values) were computed ranging from -15.8 cm to -23.1 cm, with rms about mean values on the order of 3 to 4 cm, with relatively high values for the GRIM-4C3 orbits and for SLR-only orbits for which an increased weight was applied to SLR tracking close to the Harvest or Lampedusa over ies. For these latter orbits, the rms about mean was equal to 4.42 cm and 4.68 cm, respectively. However, the mean bias estimates for these cases were found to be in close agreement with the other mean bias estimates. It was also found that the Harvest mean bias estimates, based on a maximum of 19 over ies, were close to the Lampedusa mean bias estimates, based on only 2 over ies. The maximum discrepancy between all mean bias estimates (based on at least two values) is 7.3 cm, on the order of 2.5 times the rms about mean of most mean bias estimates. The lowest rms about mean (Harvest), 2.54 cm, was found for a selection of 17 cycles when orbits were used in the calibration that had been computed from both SLR and crossover data. Results indicate that the performance of the nominal 10-day JGM-2 SLR/Doppler TOPEX orbits in the Harvest calibration can only slightly be improved by computing 1-day orbits. In addition, a cross calibration was performed between TOPEX, ERS-1 and GEOSAT. This cross calibration showed that the TOPEX and ERS-1 bias estimates are in close agreement with each other. If SWH corrections are applied, cross calibrations with ERS-1 and TOPEX suggest a GEOSAT altimeter bias equal to respectively 1.3 cm and 0.4 cm."}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "text": "The analyses described in this report would not have been possible without the support of John Ries, who showed me how to use the orbit computation and analysis program UTOPIA and reviewed this report, and Gerard Kruizinga, who provided many of the UTOPIA set-ups and supporting software."}]
