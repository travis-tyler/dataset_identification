Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can usefully be employed for the in vivo detection of such lesions [2, 3] showing moderate to high diagnostic accuracy in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) as a prodromal stage of AD compared with healthy controls in monocenter studies [4, 5] . In addition, a multicenter study from retrospectively pooled DTI data [6] suggested a high diagnostic utility (about 77% cross-validated accuracy) for the discrimination between amyloid positive people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and healthy controls [7] . In this study, DTI was superior to volumetric measures despite high vulnerability of the DTI parameters to multicenter variability [8] . This finding was very interesting because a promising biomarker for AD should also prove itself in a multicenter setting [9] , which is much closer to the future application in routine care than a monocenter study.\nSubjective cognitive decline (SCD) is a clinical atrisk stage for MCI and dementia [10] . SCD cases have a two-fold increased risk to develop dementia and a six-fold increased risk to develop MCI over on average four years of clinical follow-up compared with cognitively normal people without subjective cognitive complaints [11] . Several studies found significant differences in DTI parameters, such as fractional anisotropy or mean diffusivity, in SCD cases compared with controls [12] [13] [14] [15] . Studies on the diagnostic utility of DTI markers, however, for the discrimination between SCD cases and controls are still scarce. One recent monocenter study reported an area under the ROC curve of 78% for the discrimination between S.J. Teipel et al. / Multicenter DTI in Preclinical and Prodromal AD 457 20 SCD cases and 22 controls, but only in the training sample, i.e., without cross-validation [16] .\nSince reliable acquisition across different sites is an important prerequisite for a potentially useful biomarker, here we tested group differences and diagnostic usefulness of microstructural lesion markers across the entire AD spectrum from a prospective multicenter DTI acquisition with harmonized acquisition parameters. The cohort spans from cognitively healthy controls through SCD and MCI to AD dementia. The current analysis focused on two endpoints, discrimination of the clinical diagnoses SCD and MCI from healthy controls and the discrimination of amyloid positive SCD and MCI cases, representing preclinical or prodromal stages of AD [17] , from amyloid negative controls based on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid-\u2424 (A\u2424). We used tract-based statistics that was found in a previous multicenter reliability study to be less prone to multicenter effects than voxel-based analysis [8] . The motivation of our study was that if found useful in a prospective cohort tract-based statistics of microstructural lesion markers may be employed for risk stratification of study participants in future clinical trials."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "Data used in this study came from baseline data of the DELCODE (DZNE Longitudinal Cognitive Impairment and Dementia) study, an ongoing observational longitudinal memory clinic-based multicenter study in Germany [18] . A total of 282 participants from nine centers were included in this study. Two cases were excluded due to neuroimaging issues. One scan deviated in the number of slices (47 instead of 72) and slice spacing (3.5 mm instead of 2 mm). Another participant had a small falx meningioma and was excluded to avoid problems with the image processing algorithms. This left us with a final number of 280 participants from nine sites. DEL-CODE exclusion criteria dictate that no participant should have past or present unstable medical conditions, major psychiatric disorders, including a current major depressive episode, or neurologic diseases that are not AD [18] . The basis of these exclusion criteria was provided by a clinical assessment of cognitive status, which included the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) [19] , and an extensive neuropsychological testing battery [18] .\nThe sample included people with SCD who were cognitively unimpaired and stated to have decline in cognitive functioning unrelated to an event or condition explaining the cognitive deficits according to research criteria [10] , MCI who met National Institute on Aging -Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) workgroup core criteria for MCI [20] , AD dementia who met the NIA-AA probable AD dementia criteria [21] , and cognitively normal controls who never reported SCD and had no history of neurological or psychiatric disease or any sign of cognitive decline.\nWritten informed consent was provided by all participants, or their representatives.

To ensure high image quality, all scans had to pass a semi-automated check for SOP conformity and scan quality during data collection so that protocol deviations were reported to the study sites promptly, in order to allow the sites to adjust their acquisition. Additionally, all scans were visually inspected and controlled for 1) proper alignment of the field-of-view to cover the whole brain, 2) screened for severe imaging artifacts (e.g., aliasing/ghosting, strong noise/motion or susceptibility artifacts from metallic dental fillings), and 3) checked for incidental findings such as old strokes or meningiomas."}, {"section_title": "Biomaterial sampling", "text": "Biomaterial sampling included CSF in those participants, who consented.

In addition, in a previous clinical and physical phantom study, tract-based statistics (TBSS) was found less prone to scanner effects than voxelbased analysis [8] . Therefore, we used TBSS [25] in FSL 5.0.9 for DTI data analysis. First, diffusion scans were corrected for distortions using a gradient-echo field map and the T1-weighted scans by applying fsl prepare fieldmap and epi reg commands. After head motion and eddy current correction [26] using eddy correct with spline interpolation, surrounding skull matter was removed from the non-diffusionweighted images using FSL's brain extraction tool (bet2) [27] and diffusion tensor models were fitted using FSL's dtifit command to derive voxel-wise FA, MD, and mode of anisotropy values. The next steps involved aligning all subjects' FA images in a voxelwise nonlinear registration to MNI152 reference space, and creating a mean FA average from these transformed FA images. We then created a custom mean FA skeleton, which was thresholded at 0.2 in order to exclude more peripheral tracts with lower inter-subject correspondence. The individual participants' FA maps were then projected onto the skeleton by assigning the maximum FA value in perpendicular tract direction to the skeleton voxel at each point of the skeleton. This projection information was subsequently applied to mode of anisotropy and MD maps as well.\nFor comparison, we used classification accuracy based on hippocampus volume, an established biomarker of AD [28] . For hippocampus volumetry, we used the harmonized hippocampus segmentation protocol, an internationally driven effort under the auspices of the Alzheimer's Association [29] . Further details can be found on the project's website (http://www.hippocampalprotocol.net/SOPs/index.php). More recently, the manual hippocampus labels were integrated into an automated volumetry pipeline to ease processing of larger numbers of cases [30] . A high correspondence between manual and automated segmented hippocampi based on the harmonized protocol was shown in 135 MRI scans that were measured using both manual segmentation and automated segmentation. Following this automated processing pipeline, the T1-weighed MPRAGE images were normalized to the MNI reference template from CAT12 using SPM12 new segment and the Diffeomorphic Anatomical Registration Through Exponentiated Lie algebra (DARTEL) algorithm [31] . Subsequently, hippocampus volume was automatically computed from all voxels within the harmonized hippocampus mask regions of the normalized and modulated grey matter maps [30] .

Statistical differences were estimated by a permutation test approach with 5000 random permutations defining a null distribution of regression parameters.\nWe used variance component analysis to assess the vulnerability of tract-based DTI parameters to multicenter effects. For this, we extracted the subject level TBSS clusters using the FSL function \"fslmeants\" averaging the values of all significant voxels for the group comparisons of SCD cases versus controls and of MCI cases versus controls, respectively. This resulted in a scalar value for each individual for each comparison and each DTI parameter. We determined a random effects model in R using library \"lmer\" with the averaged cluster values as dependent variable and scanner as random effects variable. We then extracted the amount of variance attributable to the random effect of scanner divided by the total amount of variance, providing an estimate of the variance component for scanner for a given comparison and DTI parameter.\nAll models were controlled for age, sex, and scanner as covariates.

To assess the potential usefulness of these markers for future diagnostic applications we used a prospective multicenter data set within a cross-validation framework to assess the diagnostic accuracy of diffusion markers in the presence of multicenter variability.\nIn agreement with previous studies, we found reductions of FA and mode of anisotropy and increases of MD, both in MCI cases in general as well as in A\u2424-positive MCI cases compared with controls in widespread white matter fiber tracts including projections from hippocampus, as well as association fiber tracts but also parts of the internal capsule, projecting into brain stem white matter. This regional pattern was very similar to previous reports from monocenter studies [4, 5, [37] [38] [39] [40] and the pattern of diffusion changes found in the AD dementia group of the current cohort. In conclusion, these findings suggest widespread white matter microstructural degeneration already in prodromal stages of AD. The reductions of FA in MCI and AD cases spatially widely overlapped with increases of radial and axial diffusivity, in agreement with an earlier report in AD and MCI cases from the ADNI cohort [41] . Consistent with a recent review [42] , this would indicate widespread damage including impaired axonal integrity, edema and myelin damage as cause of reduced anisotropy.\nCross-validated diagnostic accuracy of DTI parameters for the distinction of MCI and MCI A\u2424positive cases from controls reached almost 80%, but was not superior to hippocampus volume, the bestestablished structural imaging marker of AD to date. This agrees with the level of accuracy found in previous monocenter studies [4, 5] , including studies using tract-based statistics [43] . Interestingly, the elastic net algorithm selected only few fiber tracts with very high frequency (>90%), another set of association fiber tracts had between 50% to 80% selection frequency. This is consistent with the widespread alterations of white matter fiber tracts, suggesting comparable diagnostic value of a wide range of tracts. The mode of anisotropy is a scalar diffusion marker that describes an important aspect of the shape of the diffusion tensor. It ranges between -1 and 1 as the shape of the diffusion tensor ranges from planar anisotropy (in areas with crossing fiber populations or adjacent orthogonal fiber orientations) through orthotropy to linear anisotropy (in areas with one predominant fiber direction) [44] . In a study using joint independent component analysis, the mode of anisotropy was decreased in MCI subjects compared to controls mainly in anterior and posterior corpus callosum and in superior and inferior longitudinal fasciculus [45] . Consistently, in the current analysis we found reductions of the mode of anisotropy in MCI in corpus callosum and cingulate gyrus, but also involving external and internal capsule and uncinate fasciculus. Thus, the mode of anisotropy reductions involved mainly regions with directed fiber tracts such as corpus callosum or cingulate bundle, indicating a loss of these directed fibers, resulting in a more orthotropic or planar shape of the diffusion tensor. SCD cases exhibited no significant fiber tract alterations at family wise error corrected p-values. Only at a liberal uncorrected level of significance of p < 0.01, we found reductions in the mode of anisotropy in restricted white matter regions, including left predominant medial temporal lobe projections. This agrees with previous monocenters studies, where diffusion parameter changes were found in some [13, 16, [46] [47] [48] , but not all studies [49, 50] , and one of the positive studies did not apply a correction for multiple comparisons [13] . In addition, none of these previous studies included amyloid markers to assess preclinical AD status of the SCD cases. The inconsistency of results across studies may reflect an only low to moderate effect size of diffusion parameter changes in SCD cases. Mode of anisotropy changes in SCD cases compared with controls have not been reported before, rendering a comparison of our findings with previous results unfeasible. The only previous study on mode of anisotropy changes in SCD used the SCD group as reference group for comparison with AD and MCI [15] .\nThe likelihood of false positive findings was high in the analysis that was uncorrected for multiple comparisons. Still, it is interesting to discuss why the mode of anisotropy, indicating a change in the diffusion tensor toward a more sphere like shape, may be the earliest diffusion marker affected in SCD in our analysis. One possible reason may be that among the three diffusion markers studied, the mode of anisotropy was least affected by multicenter effects, with a variance component of about 10% attributable to scanner, as compared with 20% for FA and almost 30% for MD. In addition, one could speculate that the reduction of the mode of anisotropy indicates a selective loss of highly directional fiber tracts within particularly vulnerable regions, such as fornix and temporal lobe white matter, but this needs to be confirmed in subsequent studies.\nDiagnostic accuracy for the discrimination of SCD cases from healthy controls was only moderate to low with 69%, and mainly driven by reductions of mode of anisotropy in the uncinate fascicle, fornix and retrolenticular part of internal capsule, but substantially higher than for hippocampus volume with 62%. This compares with an AUC of 78% for the discrimination between 20 SCD cases and 22 controls in a previous study that did, however, not use cross-validation and therefore strongly overestimated the level of accuracy [16] .\nWhen comparing A\u2424-positive SCD cases, representing a preclinical stage of AD, with A\u2424-negative controls, DTI parameters only reached random level guessing accuracy. The same was true for the comparison of the A\u2424-positive and A\u2424-negative controls and the combined analysis of A\u2424-positive SCD and controls versus the A\u2424-negative SCD cases and controls. The latter analysis included 28 amyloid positive and 51 amyloid negative cases; this substantial number of cases suggests that the lack of an effect is not just a false negative outcome. In conclusion, the white matter alterations in the SCD cases (found at an uncorrected level of significance) may be related to the clinical phenotype rather than the underlying amyloid pathology. SCD is an unspecific syndrome related to \"numerous conditions such as normal aging, personality traits, psychiatric conditions, neurologic and medical disorders, substance use, and medication. It may also be affected by the individual cultural background.\" ( [10] , pages 845/646). Thus, the white matter alterations in the SCD phenotype cases may reflect a trait from a broad range of conditions which are independent from the state of A\u2424 pathology. Consistently, not all cases with SCD progress to MCI [11] and not all MCI cases have transited through a state of SCD [51] . This would suggest that similar to white matter changes preceding the first episode of major depression [52] , the white matter alterations in SCD cases may reflect a functional (and in some cases reversible) clinical syndrome, rather than the effect from neuropathological lesions. The DELCODE protocol excludes current or past episodes of major depression as well as significant cerebrovascular disease. However, subsyndromal depressive symptoms or subclinical personality traits, such as increased anxiety, that may be related to subtle white matter alterations were not excluded.\nThere are several limitations associated with this study. First, the number of cases with available CSF was smaller than one would have wished for. Still, to our knowledge, this is the first DTI study featuring a substantial number of SCD cases stratified according to their amyloid status. Secondly, multicenter variability affects the accuracy of diffusion markers. This was even true for the prospectively harmonized DTI data acquisition and the use of tract bases spatial statistic (that was found less sensitive to multicenter effects than voxel-based analysis in a clinical phantom study [8] ). Multicenter acquisition, however, is required if one wants to test the useful of DTI measures for the application in future (multicenter) clinical trials or routine care. The variance component analysis revealed that between 9% and 29% of variance was attributable to scanner for the DTI parameters. This compares favorably with previous analysis on multicenter DTI parameters from retrospectively pooled data with more than 40% of variance attributable to scanner for FA and MD parameters in a voxel-based analysis [53] . But even mode of anisotropy that was the least affected by scanner effects among the diffusion parameters was still much more affected than hippocampus volume. Other shortcomings are the different age and sex distribution across the diagnostic groups. However, including these variables together with scanner did not affect the outcome of the diagnostic models in sensitivity analyses.\nIn conclusion, we found significant differences in widespread white matter tracts in MCI and AD cases compared with controls, including A\u2424 positive MCI cases, representing prodromal AD. In contrast, white matter alterations were detectable only at an uncorrected level of significance and spatially restricted in the SCD cases and were entirely absent in A\u2424 positive compared with A\u2424 negative SCD and control cases, suggesting an effect of clinical phenotype of SCD rather than of preclinical A\u2424 pathology on white matter tract integrity in this cohort. In the near future, we will have access to the longitudinal data of the DELCODE cohort allowing assessment of the predictive accuracy of DTI parameters for cognitive decline within the AD spectrum."}, {"section_title": "DISCLOSURE STATEMENT", "text": "Authors' disclosures available online (https:// www.j-alz.com/manuscript-disclosures/19-0446r1)."}]
