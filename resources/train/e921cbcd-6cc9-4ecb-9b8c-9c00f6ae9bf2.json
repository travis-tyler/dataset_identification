On the contrary, these students represented about one-third of undergraduates enrolled in 1992-93.1 During that academic year, about the same proportion of undergraduates were enrolled in 2-year institutions as were enrolled in 4-year colleges and universities (figure 1).2 In addition, about 6 percent of undergraduates were enrolled in lessthan-2-year institutions (primarily private, for-profit trade schools) that typically offer programs of short duration (e.g., less than a year), resulting in a vocational certificate in such fields as cosmetology and administrative/secretarial skills. 'Approximately 46 percent of undergraduates attended 4-year colleges or universities, and about 68 percent of these students were under the age of 24. Thus, overall about one-third (48 percent of 68 percent) of undergraduates were \"traditional\" students. 2This report refers to institutions that offer 2-to 3-year programs (less than a bachelor's degree) as 2-year institutions, and colleges that offer bachelor's degrees or higher as 4-year institutions. The term level refers to the highest offering of the institution. While so called traditional students represent a minority of undergraduates currently enrolled in postsecondary education, they are more successful in attaining bachelor's degrees than their less traditional peers. Traditional students are often better prepared academically to enter college,3 and they generally have adequate financial support from their families and financial aid programs.4 Such resources allow these students to concentrate on their studies full time, freeing them from the financial and time constraints often imposed on less traditional students. As the undergraduate population has expanded to include more women, older students, minorities, and students from low income families, so has the number of students at risk of not completing their educational program.5 Such students may encounter a range of economic, social, or cultural barriers to persistence and attainment in postsecondary education attendance. Often they have families to support, they may work full time while th,--are enrolled, and some have to commute long distances either to their jobs or to school. These and other external constraints may conflict with postsecondary education attendance and persistence. And for the students affected, services such as affordable child care and flexible class schedules are a necessity. In fact, researchers such as Bean and Metzner have argued that alleviating environmental stress factors plays a more important role in helpin& nontraditional students realize their educational goals than it does for more traditional students (i.e., those who enroll immediately in colleges or universities and who attend full time for the duration of their enrollment).6 These same researchers also point out that such assistance may compensate for nontraditional students' poor academic preparation or lack of social integrationkey variables related to traditional students' persistence and attainment as illustrated in Tinto's model of attrition.7 In addition to the financial and social problems less traditional students may encounter, they often have postsecondary education enrollment patterns known to reduce the chances of completing a degreemore specifically, the decision to delay their postsecondary education and, once enrolled, to attend on a part-time basis.8 However, it is also true that these enrollment choices may be the only feasible option for students either lacking the time or resources to attend full time, or the academic preparation needed to immediately enroll in postsecondary education. In addition, part-time enrollment in low cost institutions, such as community colleges, offers a wide range of opportunities for both personal and professional growth. Nevertheless, while such attendance may offer educational opportunities to individuals who might not attend otherwise, part-time attendance does increase students' chances of not completing their postsecondary program. To design appropriate programs and services for undergraduates likely to be at risk of leaving postsecondary education, it is important to know how many students are affected and where they are enrolled. It is also important to determine how risk factors are interrelated, first, because many students may face multiple risks, and second, because the ways in which these risks are interrelated may affect the kinds and amount of support students need. Finally, it should be noted that the notion of \"risk\" in this report refers only to students' risk of not completing a postsecondary program. This does not mean that postsecondary education offers no benefits to students who do not complete a degree. Indeed, students may benefit in many ways that improve their quality of life. Nevertheless, the evidence is clear and compelling that students who complete a college degree, especially a bachelor's degree, experience greater occupational and economic benefits than students who do not attain a degree.9"}, {"section_title": "Purpose and Organization of Report", "text": "This report profiles all undergraduates enrolled in U.S. postsecondary institutions in 1992-93 and the essay that follows focuses on undergraduates with risk factors and enrollment patterns known to adversely affect persistence and attainment. Data from the 1992-93 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:93) were used for this study. This survey is designed to represent students enrolled in all postsecondary institutions and to provide detailed information about postsecondary students' financial aid and educational expenses. For this analysis, the NPSAS:93 variables used as indicators of risk included not enrolling in postsecondary education the same year as graduating from high school (i.e. delayed enrollment); attending part time; being financially independent of parents (as defined by financial aid regulations); having dependents other than a spouse (either children or elders); and working full time while enrolled in postsecondary education. Since the NPSAS survey has a postsecondary focus, variables that measure students' academic preparation for postsecondary education are not available with the exception of whether or not they graduated frOm high school with a traditional high school diploma. In this report, we also examine this relatively small, but not insignificant, group of undergraduates who were not traditional high school graduates. This essay addresses students at risk of attrition in a number of ways: first, by examining the prevalence of each risk factor individually and determining where students affected are enrolled (figure 2 shows the distribution of undergraduates with each risk factor according to the level of institution in which they were enrolled); second, by determining how risk factors are interrelated and which students have multiple risk factors (as illustrated in table 1, the risk factors are strongly interrelated and most students have more than one); and third, by examining the association between risk factors and 1-year persistence rates. 27.4 4.2 1.9 NOTE: The total row shows the percentage of all undergraduates with each risk factor (i.e., 42.7 percent of undergraduates delayed enrollment). For each risk factor under the total row (row categories), the table shows the percentage of undergraduates with that risk factor who had each of the other risk factors. For example, the row labeled \"Delayed enrollment\" should read: Among undergraduates who delayed their enrollment, 63.6 percent enrolled part time; 73.4 percent were financially independent; 32.1 percent had dependents; and so on.   The timing of enrollment clearly affects the benefits of postsecondary education. To the extent that postsecondary education increases long-range earning potential and social status, the sooner students attend, the sooner they can realize these economic and social advantages. Delaying postsecondary education, however, does more than just postpone the benefits afforded by such education, it also increases the risk of dropping out.\") Studies have found that even among students with similar educational goals and those enrolled in the same types of institutions, those who delay their enrollment are substantially less likely to earn a bachelor's degree than students who enter immediately after high schoo1.11 Among undergraduates enrolled in postsecondary education in 1992-93, about 43 percent experienced some delay (table 2).1 Delaying enrollment varied according to attendance status and the degree program students were pursuing. Students who attended part time during any period of their enrollment were more likely to have delayed their enrollment than students enrolled full time for a full academic year (at least 9 months). Undergraduates pursuing shorter term awards, including certificates or associate's degrees, were more likely to have delayed their enrollment than students enrolled in a bachelor's degree program. Consistent with the patterns observed for degree programs was the association between delayed enrollment and the highest offering of an institution: students attending less-than-2year institutions were more likely to have delayed their enrollment (67 percent) than were students in 2-year institutions (52 percent); in turn, students in 2-year institutions were more likely to have delayed than those in 4-year colleges and universities (31 percent). Whether or not students delayed their enrollment was also related to their family obligations, financial resources, and having disabilities. For example, students who were married delayed more often than those who never married, and students with dependents were more likely to delay than those without dependents. Students with disabilities delayed more often than nondisabled students,13 and those in the lower income quartile were more likely to delay than students in the upper income quartile.

I3Students were asked if they had \"any of the following disabilities: hearing impairment; speech disability or limitation; orthopedic or mobility limitation; specific learning disability; vision impairment that cannot be corrected by glasses or legally blind; or any other type of limitations, disabilities, or handicaps.\" In the last 25 years, part-time attendance in postsecondary education has increased dramatically. The number of part-time undergraduates more than doubled between 1970 and 1990, from 2.1 million to 5 million students.14 In contrast, full-time enrollment increased by only one-third during this same time period. As a proportion of total enrollment, part-time enrollment increased from 28 percent to 42 percent during this period. Most of the growth, however, occurred between 1970 and 1980; thus, part-time students have been a stable part of the undergraduate population for more than 10 years. The growth in part-time enrollment has paralleled that of older students who are much more likely to attend part time than traditional college-age students.15"}, {"section_title": "10U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, Patterns and Consequences of Delay in Postsecondary", "text": "While part-time attendance expands the educational opportunities of students who either lack the resources or the time to attend full time, it also.increases the time required to earn a degree as well as the risk of dropping or stopping out.1\u00b0I n 1992-93, attending full time was still predominant in 4-year colleges and universities (figure 3). On the other hand, the majority of students in 2-year institutions (74 percent) attended part time, and these students accounted for about two-thirds of all part-time undergraduates.17 Part-time attendance was relatively evenly distributed between students attending part time for a full academic year (at least 9 months) and those attending part time, part year (26 and 28 percent, respectively) (table 3).18 As would be expected, part-time attendance (both full-and part-year, but especially part-year) was most common among students with outside demands on their time. Married students, those.with dependents, and students working full time while enrolled were particularly likely to attend on a part-time basis. On the other hand, even though women enrolled in postsecondary education tended to be older than men and were almost twice as likely to have dependents (29 percent versus 16 percent),19 they were only marginally more likely to attend part time (e.g., 27 percent compared with 24 percent attending part time for a full year).

Parents of independent students, on the other hand, are not required to pay any educational costs, though some parents do provide financial assistance. In 1992--93, roughly half of the undergraduate population (52 percent) was considered independent (table 4). Because the main criterion for independence is age (students 24 or older are automatically considered independent), most independent students were older. 21See appendix A for a complete definition of dependency st.itos. Note that the term financial dependence refers to the federal financial aid requirement stipulating that the pa,,nts of dependents must pay for a portion of their children's education.

Younger independent students are often married and have dependents of their own.2` Added to these responsibilities, younger independent students might find it particularly difficult to meet their educational expenses since they often have less employment experience than their older peers and usually receive less parental financial support than dependent students of the same age. Whether or not undergraduates were independent varied according to the length of the degree program offered by the institutions: the shorter the program, the higher the percentage of independent students. Furthermore, in addition to a higher proportion of independent students among those attending less-than-2-year institutions, the independent students were much more likely to be under the age of 24.23 Because female undergraduates were more likely to be older and to have dependents in 1992-93 than their male counterparts, they were also more likely to be independent (56 percent versus 48 percent). Among racialethnic groups, nearly 70 percent of American Indians/Alaskan Natives were independent, more than any other racialethnic group (41 percent to 59 percent). 22I1 a student under the age of 24 is married or has dependents and the student's parents did not claim the student as dependent for tax purposes, the student is considered financially independent. 23For example, 40 percent of independent students in less-than-2-year institutions were under age 24, compared with 15 percent in 2-year institutions and 9 percent in 4-year institutions (NCES NPSAS:93 undergraduate DAS)."}, {"section_title": "Undergraduates with Dependents; Single Parents", "text": "Students often enter or return to postsecondary education in order to increase their earning potential so that they can better support their families. At the same time, family responsibilities often conflict with attendance and persistence. A sick child, for instance, can result in the parent missing classes or, in some cases, having to withiraw temporarily from school. Such absences may undermine the parents' ability to complete their postsecondary education. About one-fifth of 1992-93 undergraduates (22 percent) were responsible for dependents other than a spouse (table 5). Moreover, students with serious academic limitations (i.e., those who were not traditional high school graduates) were more likely to have dependents than traditional high school graduates. Furthermore, undergraduates with disabilities were more likely to have dependents than those with no disabilities. Because of the level of commitment required to attend postsecondary education and care for dependents. it may not be surprising to see students who are responsible for dependents in shorter term postsecondary programs more often than those without dependents (figure 5). For example, 60 percent of students with dependents, compared with 44 percent of those without dependents, attended 2-year institutions. Similarly, 12 percent of students with dependents, compared with 5 percent without dependents, were enrolled in less-than-2-year institutions.   Undergraduates with perhaps the greatest obstacles to their postsecondary education are single parents. The problems encountered by students with dependents are compounded for those with no spousal support. Approximately 8 percent of undergraduates reported being single parents; and women were much more likely to be single parents than men (11 percent versus 3 percent) (table 5). Among racial-ethnic groups, black, non-Hispanic and American Indian/Alaskan Native students were more likely to be single parents than either white, non-Hispanic or Asian/Pacific Islander students. Single parents were particularly likely to have very low incomes: 23 percent had incomes under $5,000, and an additional 26 percent had incomes under $10,000 (figure 6). In addition, single parents were about four times more likely than other students to choose shortterm vocational postsecondary programs.24 For example, about 19 percent of single parents were enrolled in less-than-2-year institutions, compared with 5 percent of other independent students.

Whatever reasons students may have for working so much, combining full-time work and postsecondary education may increase their risk of attrition.25 24See compendium table 2.2b.

Because of the close association between working full time and attending school part time-about 80 percent of students working full time attended part time (see table 3)-the patterns seen for the former parallel the latter. Therefore, students enrolled in 2-year institutions were more likely to work full time than those in either less-than-2-year or 4-year institutions (47 percent, compared with 30 percent and 27 percent, respectively). Likewise, students 24 or older and students with dependents were more likely to work full time than younger students or those without dependents. Students may also work full time to reduce their need for education loans. That is, net of their financial aid grants, students may make the decision to work more hours rather than incur additional (or any) debt to pay for their education. Among 1992-93 undergraduates, independent students working full time were about half as likely as students working part time to receive any financial aid (25 percent versus 47 percent).26 At the same time, these students were only about one-third as likely as students working part time to borrow (7 percent versus 25 percent) (figure 7). This finding suggests that some students may have chosen full-time work in lieu of borrowing.27 26Many part-time students are not eligible for financial aid because they attend less than half time. \"This is consistent with a previous NCES report on working undergraduates using NPSAS:90 data showing that students who borrowed were less likely to work full time and more likely to work part time.

While this may seem like a small proportion of undergraduates, the fact that they are not as successful as traditional high school graduates in the labor market makes their success in postsecondary education all the more important.28 Moreover, in addition to their disadvantaged position in the labor market, undergraduates who were not traditional high school graduates were far more likely than traditional high school graduates to be single parents (e.g., 20 percent of GED recipients compared with 7 percent of high school graduates).-) Due to the open admission policies in most less-than-4-year institutions, students who did not graduate from high school were enrolled almost exclusively in these institutions (figure 8).

To measure the extent to which undergraduates were affected, each student was assigned a score from 0-7 representing the sum of seven possible risk factors each had. For example, all single parents are, by definition, independent and have dependents. Thus, these students have a minimum of three risk factors (table 8). Similarly, almost all students who work full time also attend postsecondary education on a part-time basis, giving them at least two risk factors. While no attempt was made to weigh each risk factor (clearly, the individual impact of some are greater than others),30 the association of the risk factors makes them cluster together in multiples. For example, only about one-fifth of undergraduates had just one risk factor. These included about 18 percent of students attending part time (i.e., attending part time was the only risk factor associated with these students), 13 percent who delayed enrollment, 7 percent who worked full time, 5 percent who were independent, and 4 percent who were GED recipients (table 8). In contrast, the vast majority of GED recipients, students with dependents, and single parents had at least four risk factors (70 percent, 77 percent, and 92 percent, respectively). One of the most compelling iesults of this analysis is that the proportion of students with four or more risk factors is almost identical to that of students with no risk factors (22 percent versus 24 percent). Thus, undergraduatfts with considerable outside responsibilities that may seriously impede thcii pr;:gress in school are as numerous as those with no such responsibilities. Moreover, students with multiple risk factors were concentrated in less-than-4-year institutions. For example, about one-third of students enrolled in either less-than-2-year or 2-year institutions had four or more risk factors. The same was true for only 13 percent of undergraduates enrolled in 4-year institutions. In contrast, about 10 percent of students in lessthan-4-year institutions had no risk factors, compared with 39 percent of those in 4-year colleges or universities. There was also a difference in the number of risk factors among students who had attained a bachelor's degree, compared with those at the same class level who had not attained this degree. That is, among students who were seniors in 1992-93, those who attained their bachelor's degree that year were more likely than seniors who had not yet attained their degree to have no risk factors (35 percent versus 24 percent), and they were about one-half as likely to have four or more risk factors (9 percent versus 17 percent). Additionally, among students enrolled in 4-year colleges, those in institutions that do not grant doctorate degrees (either public or private, not-for-profit) were more likely to have four or more risk factors than students in doctorate-granting institutions. Women were more likely than men to have four or more risk factors (26 percent versus 18 percent), as were students with disabilities (31 percent versus 25 percent). American Indian/Alaskan Native and black, non-Hispanic students were more likely to have four or more risk factors (35 percent and 31 percent, respectively) than either white, non-Hispanic 3013ecause students with no high school credentials arc precluded from entering many colleges, the impact of this risk factor is far greater than the others. Therefore, these students (about 1.9 percent of undergraduates) are not included in the analysis of multiple risk factors. students (22 percent) or Asians/Pacific Islanders (14 percent).

However, persistence within an academic year can be an important determinant of a student's eventual attainment.31 In order to examine 31For an analysis of how these risk factors affect persistence and attainment over a 5-year period, sce U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, Educational Persistence and Attainment of 1989-90 Beginning Postsecondary Students as of 1994 forthcoming. persistence within the 1992-93 academic year, the sample was limited to students who were enrolled in the fall of 1992 and who indicated that they planned to be enrolled in the following academic year . In this way, students enrolled in postsecondary education to take a class or two and those who were finishing their programs (and, therefore, attending for only one term) should have been eliminated from this group. Students who planned on attending the following year would be expected to attend for the entire academic year. It is this \"expected persistence\" that is measured in this analysis. Among all of those enrolled in the fall who also planned to attend the following year, 81 percent were enrolled for at least 8 months of 1992-93 (table 9). Almost all the risk factors identified in this study were associated with lower 1-year persistence rates (attended at least 8 months). For example, 76 percent of students who delayed entry into postsecondary education were enrolled for at least 8 months, compared with 84 percent who did not delay. A similar pattern was seen for independent students (75 versus 86 percent), students with dependents (75 percent versus 83 percent), and students who worked full time (71 percent versus 81 percent or higher). Having more than one risk factor was strongly associated with lower rates of 1-year persistence (table 9). However, the magnitude of the differences appeared to level off after two risk factors. For example, 93 percent of students with no risk factors persisted for 8 months, compared with 83 percent of those with one risk factor and 76 percent of students with two risk factors. On the other hand, the differences between persistence rates for students with two risk factors, compared with those with three or four, were not statistically significant (76 percent compared with 74 percent and 73 percent, respectively).32 Nevertheless, it is still apparent that having two or more risk factors substantially reduced students' chances of attending for a full academic year. 321t should be noted, however, that students with multiple tisk factors were more likely to enroll in nonfall terms than those with few or no risk factors; therefore, because only students enrolled in the fall could he included in the analysis, the persistence rates for undergraduates with three or more risk factors may have been overestimated.

About three-quarters of undergraduates were affected by at least one of the factors examined in this studydelaying postsecondary education enrollment, attending part time, being independent, having dependents, being single parents, and not graduating from high school. Moreover, the proportion of students who had four or more risk factors was the same as the proportion who had none (about 23 percent). Students with no risk factors are those historically considered traditional (i.e., started postsecondary education immediately after high school and attended full time). Thus, for every traditional student identified in this analysis, there was one with multiple risk factors. Students who had any risk factors usually had more than one. That is, if they worked full time, they almost always attended part time; if they had dependents, they often worked full time and attended part time, and so on. In fact, among undergraduates who had any risk factors, only one-quarter had one. (One risk factor was almost always associated with either attending part time or delaying enrollment.) However, even the presence of one risk factor was associated with lower persistence rates for a full academic year in 1992-93, when compared with having none. In addition, among students who were seniors in 1992-93, those who attained a bachelor's degree were more likely to have no risk factors and were less likely to have four or more, compared with seniors who had not completed their degree. If one examines the distribution of students according to the length of program offering of institutions, for almost every risk factor examined, the percentage of students affected went up as the length of the program went down. For example 23 percent of students enrolled in less-than-2-year institutions were single parents, contrasted with 9 percent in 2year institutions and 4 percent in 4-year colleges and universities. A similar pattern was seen for students who did not graduate from high school. Students who either worked full time or attended part time (or both), on the other hand, were more concentrated in the 2-year sector than they were in less-than-2-year institutions. Finally, given the increased likelihood that undergraduates with individual risk factors attended less-than-4-year institutions, one would also expect that those with multiple risk factors would be concentrated in this sector as well.

Instead, the survey sample was selected using a more complex threestep procedure with stratified samples and differential probabilities of selection at each level. First, postsecondary institutions were initially selected within geographical strata. Once institutions were organized by zip code and state, they were further stratified by control (i.e., public; private, not-for-profit; or private, for-profit) and offering (less-than-2-year, 2-to 3year, 4-year nondoctorate-granting, and 4-year doctorate-granting). Sampling rates for students enrolled at different institutions and levels (undergraduate or other) varied, resulting in better data for policy purposes, but at a cost to statistical efficiency. The comparisons described in the report have all been tested for statistical significance to ensure that the differences are larger than those that might be expected due to sampling variation. The following two Zypes of comparisons have been made in the report: Differences in two estimated percentages. The paired comparisons were tested using Student's t statistics. Comparisons based on the estimates of the proportions include the estimates of the probability of a Type I error, or significance level. The significance levels were determined by calculating the Student's t values for the differences between each pair of means or proportions and comparing these with published tables of significance levels for two-tailed hypothesis testing. Student's 1 values may be computed for comparisons using these tables' estimates with the following formula: mhe NPSAS sample is not a simple random sample, and therefore simple random sample techniques for estimating sampling error cannot be applied to these data. The DAS takes into account the complexity of the sampling procedures and calculates standard errors appropriate for such samples. The method for computing sampling errors used by the DAS involves approximating the estimator by the linear terms of a Taylor series expansion. The procedure is typically referred to as the Taylor series method.   161   1   E E2   t   Vse   1 +se 2   2   2 where Ei and E7 are the estimates to be compared and sel and se2 are their corresponding standard errors.

There are hazards in reporting statistical tests for each comparison. First, comparisons based on large t statistics may appear to merit special attention. This can be misleading since the magnitude of the t statisiic is related not only to the observed differences in means or percentages but also to the number of students in the specific categories used for comparison. Hence, a small difference compared across a large number of students would produce a large t statistic. A second hazard in reporting statistical tests for each comparison is making multiple comparisons among categories of an independent variable. For example, when making paired comparisons among different levels of income, the probability of a Type I error for these comparisons taken as a group is larger than the probability for a single comparison. When more than one difference between groups of related characteristics or \"families\" are tested for statistical significance, one must apply a standard that assures a level of significance for all of those comparisons taken together. Comparisons were made in this report only when p 5_ .05/k for a particular pairwise comparison, where that comparison was one of k tests within a family. This guarantees both that the individual comparison would have p 5. .05 and that when k comparisons were made within a family of possible tests, the significance level of the comparisons would sum to p For example, in a comparison of the percentages of males and females who enrolled in postsecondary education, only one comparison is possible (males v. females). In this family, k=1, and the comparison can be evaluated with a Student's t test. When students are divided into five racial-ethnic groups and all possible comparisons are made, then k=10 and the. significance level of each test must be p .05/10, or .005. The formula for calculating family size (k) is as follows: k=j * (j -1)12, where j is the number of categories for the variable being tested. In the case of race-ethnicity, there are five racial-ethnic groups (American Indian/Alaskan Native; Asian/Pacific Islander; black, non-Hispanic; Hispanic; and white, non-. Hispanic), so k=5*(5-1)/2=10. 37The standard tint p 5.05/k for each comparison is more stringent than the criterion that the significance level of the comparisons should sum to p 5.05. For tables sh,wing the t statistic required to ensure that p .5.05/k for a particular family size :ind degrees of freedom. see Olic Jean Dunn, \"Multiple Comparisons Among Means,\"Journal of the American Statistical Association 56: 52-64. 162 1 L.
