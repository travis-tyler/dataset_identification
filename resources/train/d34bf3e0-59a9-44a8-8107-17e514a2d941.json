[7] [8] [9] Metabolites represent the end result of all complex regulatory processes present in a cell and are believed to serve as proximal reporters of biological processes typical of disease. 10 Using ultraperformance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled to mass spectrometry (MS-MS), we recently reported that the plasma concentrations of three phosphatidylcholines (PCs), i.e. PC16:0/20:5 (PC1620); PC16:0/22:6 (PC1622); PC18:0/22:6 (PC1822) were lower in AD patients relative to healthy controls. 11 Subsequently, Mapstone et al. 12 reported similar results suggesting that altered peripheral levels of some PCs may be candidate biomarkers of AD conversion.\nThe main aim of the present study was to extend our previous findings of altered plasma PC concentrations in AD by examining their associations with cognitive performance and resting state cerebral blood flow (rCBF), a measure of brain function, in non-demented older individuals. We performed these analyses using data from 125 participants in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging neuroimaging substudy (BLSA-NI), in whom we measured plasma concentrations of PC1620, PC1622, and PC1822 at three time points when cognition was also assessed. Based on our findings on the associations between plasma PC concentrations and cognitive performance, we then asked whether these metabolite concentrations are also related to baseline measures of rCBF in these individuals."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods Population", "text": "Begun in 1958, the BLSA is a prospective, ongoing cohort study of community-dwelling volunteer participants 13, 14 at the National Institute on Aging (NIA).

Detailed examinations, including neuropsychological assessments and neurological, laboratory, and radiological evaluations, are conducted every two years.

We show that lower plasma concentrations of PC1620, PC1622, and PC1822 are indeed associated with poorer memory performance even in non-demented older individuals. Furthermore, lower plasma PC concentrations are also associated with decreased rCBF, an established marker of neuronal activity and brain function. 32 We find that lower plasma concentrations are associated with reduced rCBF in several cortical regions including association cortices mediating higher order cognitive processes. [33] [34] [35] Together, our results suggest that altered peripheral concentrations of these PCs may be biomarkers of perturbed brain function during aging. The finding that lower plasma PC concentrations are associated with lower memory performance in nondemented older individuals is important in the context of our recent results showing that AD patients have lower plasma concentrations of these PCs relative to healthy controls. 11 Our current findings extend our previous results and suggest that lower plasma concentration of these PC metabolites may also be related to age-associated changes in cognitive performance.\nWe also found that lower plasma PC concentrations are associated with widespread reductions in neuronal activity within several multi-modal association cortices. The results show that decreased neuronal activity in frontal, temporal, and occipital cortices occurs in relation to lower PC concentrations. Several of these regions, particularly the medial and lateral frontal cortices and the entorhinal cortex, are essential for maintenance of memory performance during aging. [36] [37] [38] [39] These findings support the associations observed between PC concentrations and cognitive function and suggest that peripheral levels of these small metabolites may reflect perturbations in brain function in older individuals.\nTaken together with previous studies implicating small metabolites as biomarkers of AD, 8, [40] [41] [42] our current findings suggest that dysregulation of peripheral PC metabolism may be a common feature of both age-associated cognitive impairment as well as AD. While we have not carried out mechanistic studies to explain the observed associations between plasma PC concentrations and brain function, it is worth noting that a large body of evidence implicates PC metabolism in several key molecular pathways intrinsic to AD. These include cholesterol transport through highdensity lipoproteins, neuroinflammation through arachidonic acid signaling, and amyloid precursor protein processing through phospholipase A2. [43] [44] [45] Another plausible mechanism that may link lower PC concentrations in plasma with changes in brain function during aging may be through their role in metabolism of the n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), eicosapentaenoic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). PCs serve as the major lipid pools into which dietary n-3 PUFAs are incorporated. 46 Several studies indicate that DHA may be neuroprotective both against AD as well age-related cognitive decline. 47, 48 While our metabolomics method is unable to directly quantify PUFA concentrations in plasma, our findings raise the possibility that alterations in plasma PC levels may influence brain function through their effects on DHA metabolism. Some limitations of our study are worth noting. These include potential threshold effects associated with plasma PC concentrations. Diagnostic checks indicated a potential non-linear association at very low PC levels with even lower baseline cognition than predicted by a strictly linear function at the lowest PC levels. Our sample size precluded formal investigation of this non-linearity.\nMoreover, our study design incorporating both plasma PC assays and 15 O-water PET in the BLSA-NI sample resulted in a relatively short period of follow-up ($7.8 years). In this highly educated and healthy sample of older individuals, longer follow-up duration may be required to observe robust age-related declines in cognitive performance and their associations with plasma PC concentrations.\nIn summary, we have shown that lower plasma concentrations of the candidate AD biomarkers PC1620, Figure 4 . Associations between rCBF and plasma concentrations of PC1622 in cognitively normal older individuals. Plasma concentrations of PC1622 were entered in a voxel-based multiple regression analysis. Highlighted (blue) regions show significantly lower rCBF at baseline in association with lower plasma baseline concentrations of PC1622. rCBF: resting state regional cerebral blood flow; PC1622: PC 16:0/22:6.\nPC1622, and PC1822 are also strong predictors of concurrent memory performance and brain function even in non-demented older individuals. Our results provide further evidence implicating abnormalities of PC metabolism in early stages of memory impairment during normal aging."}]
