Although there have always been women farm operators, national-level statistics to track their numbers and examine their characteristics were not available until the Census of Agriculture began asking for principal farm operators' gender in 1978. Using census data from 1978 through 2007, this report provides detailed information about women farmers and the types of farms they operate."}, {"section_title": "What Did the Study Find?", "text": "In this report, \"women-operated farms\" are defined as those whose principal operator-the individual most responsible for the day-to-day decisions of the farm (or ranch)-is a woman. Based on this definition, results of the analysis were as follows: \u2022 Women-operated farms increased in all sales classes. Between 1982 and2007, the number of women-operated farms grew from 121,600 to 306,200, with increases in all sales classes (measured in 2007 dollars). In contrast, the number of men-operated farms declined by 220,800, with only the largest and smallest sales classes ($500,000 or more and less than $1,000) experiencing growth. Some of the increase in the lower sales classes, however-for both women-and men-operated farms-was due to extensive methodological changes in the Census of Agriculture, introduced over time to include more small farms. \u2022 Most women-operated farms are very small. Since 1982, a majority of women-operated farms have had annual sales of less than $10,000. Most of the growth in the number of women-operated farms occurred in that sales class, increasing from three-fifths of all women-operated farms in 1982 to threefourths by 2007. In both years, the share of women-operated farms with sales less than $10,000 was about 20 percentage points more than the share of menoperated farms with sales that low. \u2022 Five percent of women-operated farms (15,400 farms) had sales of $100,000 or more in 2007. Most of these farms specialized in grains and oilseeds, specialty crops, poultry and eggs, beef cattle, or dairy. The poultry and egg specialization alone accounted for roughly half of women-operated farms with sales of $1 million or more. \u2022 Nearly half of farms operated by women specialized in grazing livestock. In 2007, 45 percent of women-operated farms specialized in raising beef cattle other than in feedlots (23 percent), horses and other equines (17 percent), or sheep and goats (6 percent). Most of these farms, however, were very small, accounting for only 16 percent of sales by all women-operated farms. \u2022 Women-operated farms specializing in poultry, specialty crops, grains, or dairy had the most sales. Although these farms totaled only 21 percent of womenoperated farms, they generated 72 percent of sales from all women's farms. \u2022 Counting secondary operators increases the number of women farmers to 1 million. In addition to the principal operator, many farms have one or more secondary operators involved in daily decisions for the farm. When all women operators, principal and secondary, were tallied for the 2007 census, about 1 million were counted as farmers-up from the 306,200 principal operators and totaling 30 percent of all U.S. farmers. Most secondary women farm operators (96 percent) were on farms whose principal operator was a man, generally the woman's husband."}, {"section_title": "How Was the Study Conducted?", "text": "Using data from the Census of Agriculture, the authors tracked long-term trends for women farm operators and their farms from 1978 (or from 1982 for data items not available from the 1978 census) through 2007, the most recent year available. To examine current characteristics of women-operated farms, the authors used data from the 2007 census. The other major data source for the analysis was the Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS), an annual USDA survey jointly conducted by the National Agricultural Statistical Service (NASS) and the Economic Research Service (ERS). The ARMS provides information not included in the Census of Agriculture about farm finances and the operator's household income and educational attainment."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Farms and ranches operated by women have more than doubled in the last 30 years. Since 1978, the first year the Census of Agriculture collected data on the gender of farmers, the share of women-operated farms has grown from 5 percent of U.S. farms to 14 percent ( fig. 1). The number of women-operated farms increased in all sales classes (based on annual sales, with adjustments for price changes). In contrast, farms operated by men declined substantially, with only the largest and smallest sales classes ($500,000 or more and less than $1,000) increasing. Women-operated farms are those whose principal operator-the individual most responsible for day-to-day management of the farm-is a woman (see the appendix for a more detailed definition). Unless otherwise qualified, the term \"women operators\" refers to principal operators only. The term \"farm,\" when used by itself in the report, includes ranches. This report examines various characteristics of women farm operators and their farms, including: \u2022 Changes in the distribution of women-operated farms and ranches by sales class (with sales measured in constant 2007 dollars). \u2022 Age, education, and off-farm work and income of women principal farm operators. \u2022 Financial performance of women-operated farms. \u2022 Farm and operator characteristics by commodity specialization. \u2022 Characteristics of women-operated farms selling at least $100,000 in farm products. \u2022 Trends in women's farmland holdings (average acreage per farm, percentage of U.S. farmland, and tenure). \u2022 Sources of Government payments to women-operated farms. The report also discusses women who are secondary operators of farms. According to the 2007 Census of Agriculture-the latest census-women operated more than 300,000 farms and ranches as the principal operator. (There is one principal operator for each farming operation, by definition). Many farms, however, have more than one operator involved in daily decisions. When both principal and secondary operators are tallied for the 2007 census, about 1 million women are counted as U.S. farmers."}, {"section_title": "Data Sources", "text": "Most data used in the study are from various Censuses of Agriculture. The 2007 census is used to analyze current conditions, while earlier censuses, back to 1978, add historical perspective. In some cases, we can follow trends for women farmers only from 1982 forward because the 1978 census provides less data on women farmers than later censuses. While we use publicly available census data, we also use confidential farm-level census records for 1982-2007, accessed under an agreement with the USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), which administers the census. The agreement is designed to protect data security and confidentiality. Access to individual observations allows more analyses than are possible from published tables or public-use data files. In addition, we use the Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS), an annual survey conducted jointly by USDA's National Agricultural Statistical Service (NASS) and Economic Research Service (ERS) agencies. ARMS data are used to fill gaps in the 2007 census data for statistics on farm finances and farm operators' household income and educational attainment. (For more information about the data sources, see the appendix.) Both the Census of Agriculture and ARMS use the USDA definition of a farm: Any place that produced and sold, or normally would have produced and sold, at least $1,000 of agricultural products during a given year. In determining whether an establishment is a farm, Government payments count as sales. If a place has sales less than $1,000, a \"point system\" assigns points for acres of various crops and head of livestock-1 point equals $1 in potential sales-to estimate normal sales. \"Point farms\" are those that have actual sales and Government payments totaling less than $1,000 but points plus actual sales and Government payments worth $1,000 or more."}, {"section_title": "Previous ERS Research", "text": "ERS has a history of examining the characteristics of women-operated farms and following changes in the number of these farms. For example, the Family Farm Report series periodically estimates women's share of all principal farm operators (e.g., Hoppe et al., 2007). Some Family Farm Reports have also devoted a major section to women-operated farms. For example, Korb (2005) examined growth in the number of women-operated farms and changes in their characteristics over time. She also found that women-operated farms were more likely to be new entrants to agriculture than men-operated farms. An Amber Waves article documented the growing involvement of women in horse farming (Offutt and Korb, 2006). More recently, a report on changes in farm structure over the past 30 years discussed the growing share of U.S. farms operated by women since 1982 (O'Donoghue et al., 2011, p. 8). Other ERS reports have examined issues in agriculture that have a bearing on women-operated farms. For example, Nickerson and Hand (2009) examined enrollment in conservation programs by specific groups of farmers, including women. In addition, a report on the organization of broiler production found that women made up a larger share of operators on broiler farms than on other farms (MacDonald, 2008, pp. 19-20). The current report updates the previous reports by publishing the latest available information. In addition, it provides more detailed information for a variety of topics related to women-operated farms, including increases in their number by constant dollar sales class, farm characteristics by specialization, financial performance by sales class, and receipt of Government payments, along with information on secondary women operators. Our access to both individual census observations and the ARMS made these detailed analyses possible."}, {"section_title": "Shifts in the Size Distribution of Farms, 1982-2007", "text": "Sales are arguably a better general measure of a farm's size than its acreage. Farmland can be of varying quality, it can be farmed at different levels of intensity, and it can produce a variety of commodities. As a result, production per acre can vary widely from farm to farm. Sales measure production in dollars rather than the level of a single input (land). When sales class is used to measure trends in farm size over time, it is important to adjust the sales for changes in agricultural prices. Price variations can change revenue without any change in the physical volume of production. Accordingly, in this report, we adjust sales of agricultural products for price changes using the Producer Price Index (PPI) for farm products, which is the same as the NASS index of prices received by farmers for all farm products. The distribution of farms by sales class is expressed in 2007 constant dollars for both 1982 and 2007 in table 1. 1 Therefore, changes in the number of farms by constant dollar sales classes reflect changes in the quantity of products sold, not the 43-percent increase in agricultural prices between 1982 and 2007."}, {"section_title": "More Women-Operated Farms in All Sales Classes", "text": "The total number of women-operated farms grew by 152 percent between 1982 and 2007, and each sales class experienced a gain. The rate of increase was particularly large for farms with no sales, which grew twelvefold. Rapid growth also occurred at the other end of the size distribution. Women-operated farms with sales of $500,000 to $999,999 grew by 277 percent, while those with sales of $1 million or more grew by 714 percent, from less than 300 in 1982 to nearly 2,000 in 2007. Most of the million-dollar farms operated by women in 2007 specialized in poultry and eggs (46 percent) or specialty crops (21 percent). In contrast to the substantial growth in the number of women-operated farms, the number of men-operated farms declined by 10 percent. Men-operated farms increased in only three sales classes-sales less than $1,000 (point farms, defined on page 2), $500,000 to $999,999, and $1,000,000 or more. The trends for the number of men-operated farms by sales class were similar to those for all U.S. farms, as one would expect, given their 86-percent share of all farms (see box, \"Shifts in the Sales Class of U.S. Farms: An Explanation,\" p. 6)."}, {"section_title": "A Growing Share of Women-Operated Farms", "text": "Since the number of women-operated farms grew more rapidly than that of men-operated farms in each sales class, women principal operators increased their share of farms in every sales class during the past 25 years ( fig. 2). Women operators accounted for 14 percent of all farms, but their share of farms with no sales and sales of $1 to $999 were even larger, 22 and 20 percent, respectively. For sales exceeding $100,000, however, women's share of farms remained small, in the 4-to 5-percent range. "}, {"section_title": "Shifts in the Sales Class of U.S. Farms: An Explanation", "text": "Between 1982 and 2007, the number of farms in the United States was fairly stable, declining by only 1.6 percent (table 1). This apparent stability, however, conceals a major redistribution of farms by sales class. Farms with sales of at least $1 million (\"million-dollar farms\") tripled in number, and the number of farms with sales between $500,000 and $999,999 grew by 75 percent. At the other end of the size distribution, the number of point farms (sales less than $1,000, defined on page 2) more than doubled, largely because of a fivefold increase in the number of farms with no sales. The number of farms declined in all the other sales classes. The total farm count was stable because increases in point farms and farms with sales of $500,000 or more nearly offset the 536,000 decline in the number of farms with sales between $1,000 and $499,999. Profitability generally increases with sales, which gives larger farms-such as those with sales above $500,000-a competitive advantage from economies of size in farming (Hoppe et al., 2008, p. 33). As a result, these larger farms have increased in number as the number of farms in most of the other sales classes declined. Farms at the lower end of the sales class distribution, particularly point farms, can increase in number independently of the farm economy because their operators depend almost entirely on off-farm income. Their off-farm income allows them to farm-despite losses typically generated by the farm business-as long as off-farm income is large enough is to cover the losses. Many point farms actually are rural residences where the household's main reason for entering farming (on a very small scale) is the lifestyle it provides. Why farmers continue to farm despite negative returns is discussed later in the report. Thus, most of the growth in women-operated farms was concentrated in the lower end of the size distribution (table 2). The total number of women-operated farms increased by 184,600 between 1982 and 2007, and 89 percent of the increase occurred among farms with sales less than $10,000, largely among point farms. At least some of the increase in women-operated farms with sales less than $10,000 was due to methodological changes in the Censuses of Agriculture since 1982 that increased the count of small farms (see \"Changes in Census Methodology\" in the appendix, p. 43). The undercoverage adjustment (to compensate for farms missed by the census), for example, had a larger impact on women-operated farms with sales under $10,000 than on larger farms. The adjustment increased the count of women-operated farms with sales less than $10,000 by 37 percent in 1997, compared with 9 percent for larger farms. 2 Farms with sales less than $10,000 now account for 78 percent of the farms operated by women, up 16 percentage points from 1982 (table 1). The share of men's farms with sales less than $10,000 also increased-from 41 percent to 57 percentlargely as a result of a 351-percent growth rate for farms with no sales. The high share of women-operated farms with sales less than $10,000 affects women farmers' demographic characteristics, commodity specialization decisions, tradeoffs between farm and off-farm work, participation in government programs, and landholdings. "}, {"section_title": "Characteristics of Principal Women Farm Operators, With Gender Comparisons", "text": "Women and men principal operators differ in age, educational attainment, and participation in the nonfarm economy. The average age of women operators is higher than that of male operators, but this difference between the genders has declined since 1982. Women farm operators also have more education than both their male counterparts and U.S. householders in general. Although fewer women than men operators report off-farm work, the gender difference has diminished since 1982."}, {"section_title": "Women Farm Operators Are Older", "text": "Women farmers are older on average than male farmers, but the gap between their ages is narrowing. The average age of women operators was 59 years in 2007, compared with 57 years for male operators ( fig. 3). The average age for women, however, increased by only 3 years between 1982 and 2007, while the average for men increased by 7 years. As a result, the gap between men's and women's average ages fell from 6 years in 1982 to 2 years in 2007. The number of men operating farms is decreasing, which means that more men are leaving farming than are entering. Few younger farmers enter farming relative to the larger population of older existing farmers, resulting in an aging population of male farmers over the study period. The aging of male farmers is apparent in figure 3 from the 7-year increase in their average age, the near-doubling of the share of those at least 65 years old, and the halving of the share of those less than 45 years old. In contrast, the number of women entering farming exceeds the number exiting. This dampens the effects of aging, and as a result, trends in the distribution of women operators by age class are less pronounced. Women operators' average age increased, but only by a modest amount, and the share of women operators at least 65 years old has been roughly one-third since 1978. Nevertheless, farm operators, both women and men, are much older on average than their self-employed counterparts in nonagricultural industries. Only 8 percent of the nonagricultural self-employed (U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2008, p. 224) are 65 years old or more, compared with 34 percent of women principal farm operators and 29 percent of men principal farm operators. The farm is the home for most farm operators, which means that farmers can phase out of the business gradually over a decade or more. Improved healthcare and advances in farm equipment have also allowed operators to continue farming later in life (Mishra et al., 2005, p. 14), as have the introduction by USDA of the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP; administered by the Farm Service Agency) and the Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP; administered by the Natural Resources Conservation Service). 3"}, {"section_title": "Women Farm Operators Are More Highly Educated", "text": "On average, women farmers and ranchers are better educated than their male counterparts ( fig. 4). Approximately 61 percent of women principal operators have education beyond high school (with 32 percent having a college degree and 29 percent some college), compared with only 47 percent of male principal operators. The shares of women farmers who continued their education beyond high school also exceeded those of all U.S. householders by 4 percentage points. At the other end of the educational spectrum, only 6 percent of women operators reported not graduating from high school, compared with 10 percent of men operators and 13 percent of all U.S. householders. The share of women primary farm operators who reported either attending or completing college was larger than for men operators, regardless of their age, occupation, or whether they were retired (table 3). The shares with college experience also differed by sales class. Women who operate farms with sales less than $250,000 were more likely than their male counterparts to have at least some college. Once sales exceeded $250,000, however, differences between male and female operators narrowed substantially."}, {"section_title": "Women Operators Often Rely on Off-Farm Work and Income", "text": "The share of women working off-farm has grown substantially, from 42 percent in 1982 to 59 percent in 2007 ( fig. 5), an increase of 17 percentage points. The share of men working off-farm also increased, although the increase was less pronounced at approximately 12 percentage points. Off-farm work is most common among the Table 3 Share of principal operators with at least some college 1 by gender of principal operator, 2007 operators of farms with sales less than $10,000; about three-fourths of those operators worked off-farm in 2007, compared with about half of the operators of larger farms. The increase in the number of farms with sales less than $10,000 helps account for the increase in off-farm work reported by farm operators, both male and female. However, fewer women operators reported off-farm work than men operators in 2007 (59 versus 65 percent, respectively). Most of the difference occurred in the share of operators reporting 200 or more days of off-farm work. The higher share of women operators at least 65 years old-who are less likely than younger operators to work off-farm-helps explain the lower share of off-farm work reported by women. The share of women operators working off-farm varies substantially by specialization, however, as will be discussed later. Women's off-farm work is reflected in the sources of their income (table 4). For women operators in the aggregate, the median farm earning was -$4,200; that is, more than half of women operators lost money farming in 2007 after accounting for expenses, including depreciation. Their median household income, however, was $42,600, reflecting substantial off-farm income. Because roughly three-fourths of women-operated farms have sales less than $10,000, median household income by source is similar for all women operators and for women operating farms selling less than $10,000 of farm products. Farms with sales that low are too small to generate much income for the operator's household, so the households rely heavily on off-farm income. Their median off-farm income was $50,600, practically the same as the $50,200 median income for all U.S. households. Women who operate farms in the next sales class ($10,000 to $99,999) also relied heavily on off-farm income, on average. Even among women with sales of $100,000 or more, median off-farm income was $36,800. (See box, \"Defining Operator Household Income,\" for information about how operator household income is calculated.) "}, {"section_title": "Defining Operator Household Income", "text": "Operator household income measures the income available to the household of the principal operator. It includes any income received by household members. As measured in the Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS), it has three components: 1. Farm business income. In the case of unincorporated businesses and S-corporations, the household's farm business income is calculated as its share of net cash income generated by the farm. Net cash income is gross cash income-the sum of the sales of commodities, other miscellaneous farm-related income, and Government payments-less cash expenses and depreciation. 1 The household of the principal operator does not necessarily receive all the business income generated by its farm. For example, business income may be shared with partners or relatives who hold an interest in the farm. In the case of C-corporations, farm business income is the dividends paid to household members. Wages paid to the operator by farms organized as S-or C-corporations are also included in farm business income."}, {"section_title": "Returns to Women-Operated Farms", "text": "We examine farm profitability using the rate of return on equity, a commonly used profitability measure that compares net farm income with the net worth of the farm.

The positive relationship between returns and sales is most apparent for all farms and for men-operated farms. The relationship also occurs for women-operated farms, with one exception: the rate of return for women-operated farms does not increase as sales increase to the $250,000 to $999,999 level. Most of the women-operated farms in that sales class are livestock farms-largely poultry operations-and those womenoperated livestock farms collectively experienced a -3.2-percent rate of return on equity in 2007. The number of women-operated farms in the sales class is quite small, however, accounting for only 2 percent of all women-operated farms. Overall, the rate of return on equity is lower for women (-2.7 percent) than for men (1.4 percent). This is largely the result of the heavy concentration of women on farms with sales less than $10,000, which have the lowest rates of return. Approximately 80 percent of women operate farms that small, compared with only 60 percent of men. The rate of return is actually similar for women-and men-operated farms in each sales class, except for the $250,000 to $999,999 class."}, {"section_title": "Farming Despite Negative Returns", "text": "The rate of return on equity can be used to value alternative investments. For example, consider the -4.0 percent rate of return on equity for women who operate farms with sales less than $10,000. From the perspective of current income generation, it would seem more rational for these operators to sell the farm and place the proceeds in certificates of deposit paying low-but positive-interest. The rate of return on equity may be particularly important for older operators, those 65 or older, since they may be less able to increase their off-farm income. Nevertheless, the number of women-operated farms has grown over the years. There are benefits from farming that are not included in measures like current net farm income and return on equity (Hoppe et al., 2005). Farming provides the opportunity for capital gains in the long run, as well as the opportunity to leave a bequest to heirs. It also allows farm households to use losses from farming as writeoffs against off-farm income (Durst, 2009, pp. 4-6). Farmers may also value the lifestyle that farming provides. Farmers-male or female-may accept low or negative current returns from farming if they value benefits from farming other than the net income the farm currently generates. Of course, operators must have enough off-farm income to absorb any negative cash flow from the farming business, even if longterm prospects for capital gains are promising."}, {"section_title": "Farms and Sales by Specialization", "text": "A farm is said to specialize in a commodity if that commodity, or commodity group, accounts for at least half the farm's market value of sales.

For more information about the specializations used here, see box \"Commodity Specializations,\" p. 16. About 45 percent of women operators specialize in grazing livestock, namely, beef cattle not in feedlots, horses, and-to a much lesser extent-sheep and goats ( fig. 7). These three specializations, however, make up only 16 percent of sales by women-operated farms. Farms specializing in poultry, specialty crops, grains and oilseeds, or dairy account for the bulk of sales by women-operated farms (72 percent), although these farms make up only a 21-percent share of all women-operated farms. Although the largest share of women farmers specialized in beef cattle farming, only 11 percent of the U.S. farms with that specialization were operated by women in 2007 ( fig. 8).

Nearly half of these farms (47 percent) have sales between $10,000 and $99,999, substantially more than any other specialization. The share of women's grain farms selling less than $10,000 is only 31 percent, substantially lower than any other specialization except dairy. At the other end of the size spectrum, 22 percent of women-operated grain farms have sales above $100,000-more than any other specialization, with the exceptions of dairy and poultry. Fewer economies of scale exist for field crops than for livestock operations (O'Donoghue et al., 2011, pp. 48-49), so these economies are less of a factor in encouraging grain farmers to become larger or downsize to a residential farm. However, technological factors-including larger and faster equipment-have increased the acreage that operators can manage. The ability of operators to manage more acres may help explain the relatively large 59-percent share of women's grain farms with only one operator. The corresponding estimates of a single operator for other high-sales specializations-those reporting sales per farm above the $58,400 average for all women-operated farms-are lower, ranging from 45 to 51 percent. 4 Alternatively, the large share of one-operator farms among women's grain farms may reflect the presence of older widows.

In contrast, it would have required 158 acres of field corn, a traditional row crop, to generate sales that high. 5 Only 11 percent of women's specialty crop farms, however, have sales of $100,000 or more, and a majority (53 percent) have sales less than $10,000. The substantial share of specialty crop farms generating less than $10,000 in sales is reflected in the 63-percent share of women operators working off-farm, including 31 percent with at least 200 days of off-farm work.

Most farms in the miscellaneous crop category (85 percent) receive Government payments, especially land retirement payments from programs like CRP and WRP. (Government payments will be discussed in greater detail in a later section.) The average age of women operators who specialize in miscellaneous crops is 66 years or 7 years older than the average for all women farmers. More than half (56 percent) are at least 65 years old. Women in this category typically are not heavily engaged in farming; only 16 percent give farming as their main occupation. A much larger share (55 percent) state that they are retired.

Nearly three-fourths of beef cattle farms and ranches (72 percent) have sales less than $10,000, and only 3 percent have sales greater than $100,000 (table 6). These beef operations use land extensively for grazing, however, and average 414 acres per farm, roughly double the average for all farms operated by women. Small beef cattle operations are typically cow-calf enterprises, which produce and sell calves. The calves are purchased by stocker operations that pasture calves to gain weight and then either finish the cattle themselves on grain or sell them to feedlots as yearlings (Cash, 2002, p. 21). Cow-calf enterprises offer three advantages to operators of small farms. First, beef cows are less labor-intensive than many other enterprises (except when calving), which may be attractive to retired operators or operators who hold a full-time job off the farm. Second, cow-calf enterprises tend to be low cost, which limits cash requirements. Third, cow-calf operations can use land that is less suited for crops (Cash, 2002, p. 21). Note: See box \"Commodity Specializations,\" p. 16 of the report, for definitions of the specializations. Many women raising beef cattle are older or work extensively off-farm-two groups that may be interested in less than full-time farming. About 40 percent of women operating cattle farms and ranches are at least 65 years old; a similar 37-percent share of the operators report they are retired.

These low sales levels are largely due to the nature of the horse business-it can take years to bring a horse to a marketable stage. A race horse might race at as early as 2 years old, but most recreational equine activities require a horse with more maturity and training, extending the time to produce a marketable animal. There may also be some years when no horses are ready to sell, so the farm's sales may be sporadic. Some operations may own five or more horses for recreational purposes with no plans for a sale but still be classified as a farm through the point system. Women's horse farms are small in acreage as well as sales, averaging just 42 acres, or one-fifth the average for all farms operated by women; it does not necessarily take a lot of land to raise horses. Given the small average acreage and low sales of their farms, it is not surprising that 70 percent of women with horse farms work off-farm, including 47 percent who do so at least 200 days per year. Nevertheless, 46 percent of women horse farmers still consider farming to be their main occupation.

They are also small in acreage, averaging 84 acres or less than half the average for all women-operated farms. Some aspects of sheep and goat production are attractive to small-scale producers. Like cow-calf enterprises, sheep or goats raised for meat-and wool in the case of sheep-require relatively small amounts of labor, except when lambing, shearing, or kidding. In addition, the animals are smaller than cattle and easier to handle. The cost of breeding stock is less than for cattle, and the returns from breeding stock purchases are realized sooner. On the other hand, sheep and goats need more expensive fencing than cattle and are subject to predation and parasites (Wright, 2005;Machen and Lyons, 2000). Dairy goats are a special case and require much more labor, as well as an emphasis on sanitary milking procedures (Coffey et al., 2004, pp. 2-3 and 5-7). Women who operate sheep or goat farms have similar characteristics to those who operate horse farms. Like women horse farmers, over half of women with sheep or goat farms report an occupation other than farming. About two-thirds of both groups work off-farm, although sheep or goat farmers are less likely to work fulltime. Both groups tend to be younger than average. Women sheep and goat producers average 55 years of age, midway between the averages for all women farmers (59 years) and women horse farmers (52 years)."}, {"section_title": "Poultry and Eggs", "text": "Women's poultry farms fall into two clusters: 75 percent had sales less than $10,000, while another 23 percent had sales of $100,000 or more. Farms averaged 58 acres for the specialization, roughly one-fourth the average acreage for all women-operated farms. A limited amount of land is necessary for the small flocks on farms with sales less than $10,000, where poultry or eggs may be produced for home consumption, for local sales, or for exhibition at poultry shows. Even for larger operations, little land may be necessary. The largest operations-those with sales of $100,000 or more-usually have production contracts. Production contractors typically provide feed to producers, so farmers with contracts do not need large acreages to grow their own feed. Overall, only 23 percent of women-operated poultry and egg farms had production contracts, compared with 40 percent of their men-operated counterparts. However, more than 90 percent of poultry farms with sales of at least $100,000 had production contracts-generally for broilers-regardless of gender. In contrast, only 1 percent of poultry farms with sales less than $100,000 had production contracts, again regardless of gender. The smaller overall rate of contract use for women-operated farms reflects the smaller share of their farms with sales greater than $100,000. 6 Women poultry farmers are nearly evenly divided between those who report farming as their major occupation (51 percent) and those who report another occupation (49 percent), and about 40 percent report working off-farm at least 200 days per year. Even on commercially oriented farms with contracts, poultry or eggs can be produced by farmers who combine off-farm employment with a limited number of hours spent on the farm. For example, average off-farm income for households of commercial broiler producers was fairly high in 2006, ranging from $36,500 to $45,200 (considering the households of both women-and men-operated farms), depending on the size of the operation (MacDonald, 2008, p. 24)."}, {"section_title": "Hogs and Pigs", "text": "In some respects, women farmers specializing in hogs are similar to their counterparts specializing in poultry.

Both groups of women-operated farms use contractsat least among the larger farms-although hog farms use production contracts at a much lower rate (8 percent) than poultry farms (23 percent). The share of women operators working off-farm, however, is higher for hog farmers (69 percent) than for poultry farmers (61 percent), and the share of operators who report an occupation other than farming is 8 percentage points higher for women specializing in hogs.

Some of the miscellaneous livestock farms may be large operations producing minor grazing species, such as bison, or a combination of more common grazing species in which no single species predominates.

The total number of women-operated farms with these two specializations was very small, however. There were only 4,800 feedlots and hog farms operated by women in all the sales classes, and they make up a small share of each sales class. The share of all women's beef cattle farms and ranches with sales of $100,000 or more (3 percent) was actually small when compared with the shares for feedlots (8 percent) and hogs (13 percent), but beef farms are the single largest specialization among women farm operators. Three percent of the 69,300 women-operated beef operations amount to 14 percent of all commercial farms operated by women ( fig.  9). Interestingly, beef cattle was the only specialization accounting for more than a tenth of women-operated farms with sales less than $10,000 and also for farms with sales of $100,000 or more. Specialization among commercial farms varies by farm size (table 7). For example, the poultry and egg specialization starts at 4 percent of farms with sales between $100,000 and $249,999 and climbs rapidly to 46 percent of million-dollar farms. Million-dollar farms average 1,440 acres per farm, but this high average reflects large beef and grain operations using land extensively.

Average age declines as sales increase, which is a common pattern among farmers: older operators tend to scale back their operations, even at a high level of sales.

Women operators of commercial farms are more involved in farming than women operators in general.

Only 7 percent of the land in farms was operated by women by 2007. Average acres per farm for women-operated farms also declined from roughly 300 acres between 1978 and 1992 to 210 acres by 2007. The decline in average acreage is consistent with the large increase in women-operated farms with sales less than $10,000. The decline in average acreage also coincides with the introduction of methodological changes that increase the number of small farms, beginning in the 1997 Census of Agriculture (see \"Changes in Census Methodology\" in the appendix, p. 43). Women's average acreage, however, differs substantially by specialization from the 210-acre U.S. average in 2007. For example-as shown in tables 5 and 6-five specializations average between 40 and 90 acres (horses and other equines, specialty crops, poultry and eggs, hogs and pigs, and sheep and goats), while three specializations average more than 400 acres (grains and oilseeds, beef cattle farming and ranching, and miscellaneous livestock). Farms with sales of $100,000 or more average 1,320 acres (table 7). Women own more than three-fourths of the land they operate and are less likely to rent land than male operators (table 8). As of 2007, about 85 percent of women were full owners, compared with 66 percent of their male counterparts. This 20-percentagepoint difference in the full-ownership rate has persisted since 1978. Full-ownership declines as farm size increases, helping to explain why women are more likely to be full owners than men. Renting is a way to expand by controlling more land without debt and the commitment of capital associated with land ownership. More of women operators' land is in pasture and range than in crops-63 versus 26 percent, consistent with their specializations. Fifty-one percent of the land used by women operators is on farms and ranches specializing in grazing livestock (mostly beef cattle, but also horses and sheep and goats), which often use pasture and rangeland extensively.

CRP, which accounts for most of the land enrolled in land retirement programs, has several characteristics appealing to older operators, like many of the women operating miscellaneous crop farms. It requires little labor or capital investment and also provides a guaranteed income stream, since CRP contracts have a term of 10 or 15 years. Finally, older operators may have land available to enroll in CRP as they scale back their operations and reduce the size of their crop enterprises.

Women secondary operators tend to be less involved in farming than women primary operators. About 32 percent of women second and third operators report farming as their major occupation, compared with 40 percent of women primary operators. Roughly 40 percent of secondary women operators work off-farm at least 200 days per year, slightly higher than the corresponding 36-percent estimate for women principal operators.  7 Detailed data, including gender, were collected for up to three operators in the Census of Agriculture.

This means, however, that the counts of secondary operators in the tables exclude 23,751 female operators and 32,165 male operators on farms with 4 or more operators. The number of farms with four or more operators is fairly small-32,800 farms, or less than 2 percent of all U.S. farms.

Only 3 percent are the second or third operator on women-operated farms. In contrast, the overwhelming majority of male operators, 83 percent, are principal operators. Male operators on women-operated farms account for only 6 percent of all male operators. Many farms are actually run as joint operations by a married couple, with both spouses serving as an operator. The census does not collect information on the marital status of operators, but ARMS does. 8 According to the 2007 ARMS, the spouse of the principal operator is an operator on about one-third of farms, and spouses account for two-thirds of all secondary operators (Hoppe and Banker, 2010, 8 The ARMS questionnaire collects detailed information on up to three operators. It asks if the principal operator is married. If so, the questionnaire then asks if the spouse is also an operator. If the spouse is also an operator, the questionnaire classifies the spouse-operator as the second operator. The census questionnaire, in contrast, does not ask if the principal operator is married or if the spouse is also an operator. pp. 21-22). Joint operations by a couple are likely to report the husband as the principal operator. In many cases, the husband may actually be the principal operator, with the most responsibility for day-to-day decisions.

The man principal operator is, on average, 3 years older than the woman second operator, 55 versus 52 years, with little variation by sales class (table 14). This age difference is consistent with ARMS data for women second operators working on farms operated by couples, since husbands tend to be slightly older than wives. In the 2007 ARMS, for example, men principal operators average 56 years of age on married couple farms compared with 53 years for their wives. 9 Although joint operations are common, roughly three-fifths of all men-operated farms have only one operator (table 13). After sales exceed $250,000, however, the one-operator share falls from the 60-percent level and an increasing share of farms have two or more operators, but with a diminishing role for women second operators. In fact, two-operator farms with a male principal operator and a female second operator decline steadily from 33 percent of all men-operated farms to 18 percent as sales increase from less than $10,000 to $1 million or more. As farms increase in size, they often require more management and labor. Additional operators can provide this, and possibly other resources such as farmland or capital.

In contrast, the 2007 ARMS reports husbands as slightly older than their wivesaveraging 55 and 53 years of age, respectively-on married couple farms with a woman principal operator. The higher average age for the woman principal opera-tors in the census data suggests that many of the male second operators in the census data are younger relatives or hired managers, rather than spouses. One-operator farms account for about three-fifths of women-operated farms, the same share as for men-operated farms (table 13). In contrast to men-operated farms, the one-operator share of women-operated farms begins to decline immediately after the smallest sales class (sales less than $10,000). The increasing share of farms with multiple operators is driven by increases in the share of farms with male second operators and farms with three or more operators. The additional male operators could be husbands, partners, or hired managers providing more labor and management.

Some of the key findings are summarized below. They should be useful to anyone interested in women farmers or changes in farm structure, to firms doing business with farmers, and to Federal and State agencies serving farmers. In the 25 years between 1982 and 2007, the number of women-operated farms more than doubled, with increases in all sales classes. The number of men-operated farms, in contrast, declined by 10 percent, with declines in most sales classes. Some of the increase in women-operated farms, however, was due to changes in the Census of Agriculture designed to include more small farms. On average, women principal operators are older than their male counterparts. The gap between the average age of women and men principal operators has narrowed, as the difference between their average ages fell from 6 years in 1982 to 2 years by 2007. The number of younger women entering farming exceeds the number of older women leaving, which dampens the effects of aging. Farms with sales less than $10,000 now account for 78 percent of women-operated farms. Most growth in women-operated farms after 1982 came from operations of that sales class, despite the negative rate of return on equity for farms of that size. Yet, about 5 percent of women-operated farms had sales of $100,000 or more in 2007. Nearly half of women-operated farms specialize in grazing livestock: beef cattle, horses and other equines, or sheep and goats. Most of these livestock farms are very small, accounting for only 16 percent of sales generated by women-operated farms. Another 21 percent of women-operated farms specialize in poultry, specialty crops, grains, or dairy, but they generated 72 percent of the sales from women-operated farms. Fifty-six percent of payments received by women-operated farms in 2007 came from land retirement programs such as the CRP and WRP, compared with only 20 percent for farms operated by men. Miscellaneous crop farms receive nearly 80 percent of the land retirement payments made to women operators, reflecting their advanced age. Many farms are actually joint operations run by married couples, where both spouses act as operators. The 2007 Census of Agriculture found that about three-fifths of all women operators-considering both principal and secondary operators-are listed as the second operator on farms operated by men, most likely their husband. Joint operations by a couple are likely to report the husband as the principal operator. operation may receive, such as payments for custom work performed or production contract fees. In ARMS data, the level of sales is generally gauged by a similar measure, gross farm sales (Hoppe et al., 2010, p. 3). To be consistent with the census data used in this report, gross farms sales from ARMS were converted to the market value of sales by subtracting Government payments received by the farm business and its landlords."}, {"section_title": "Changes in Census Methodology", "text": "The Bureau of the Census was responsible for conducting the agricultural census from its inception in 1840until 1996(U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, NASS, 2009. Responsibility for the census was moved to NASS by the 1997 Appropriations Act, and NASS has conducted the last three censuses (for 1997, 2002, and 2007). After taking over the Census of Agriculture, NASS instituted some methodological changes. Beginning with the 2002 census, NASS began adjusting census estimates to compensate for undercoverage. In addition, NASS increased its efforts to contact all small farms for the census. For more information about these and other changes, see box, \"Counting Small Farms-Methodological Changes,\" p. 44. These methodological changes improved the quality of census data, especially for small farms, but complicated the analysis of trends. For example, adjusting for undercoverage and more actively seeking out small farms missed in previous censuses gives a more accurate count of smaller farms. The improved count, however, is not fully comparable with counts from previous censuses-analysts cannot know how much of the increase in small farms is due to methodological changes and how much to the actual entry of new farms."}]
