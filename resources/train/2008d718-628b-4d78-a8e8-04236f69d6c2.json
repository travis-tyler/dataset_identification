Two groups of healthy male and female volunteers from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging were studied: 11 young subjects (6 male, 5 female, age 34.7 \u03ee 5 yr, range 27.4-41.6 yr) and 20 older subjects (11 male, 9 female, age 73.5 \u03ee 8 yr, range 60.8-87.5 yr). All subjects were free of cardiac or peripheral vascular disease, untreated hypertension, significant arthritis of the upper limbs, and neuromuscular disease. The experimental protocol was approved by the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center Institutional Review Board for Human Subjects Research, and informed consent was obtained from each individual before the study.\n31 P MRS. 31 P MR spectra were obtained with a 1.9-T, 31-cm superconducting magnet (Oxford Instruments, Oxford, UK) interfaced to a Bruker Biospec ABX console (Bruker Meolizindechnik, Erlangen, Germany). A homebuilt double tuned three-turn elliptical surface coil (2.9 \u03eb 3.8 cm) was positioned over the FDP muscle of the nondominant arm. The muscle was located by palpation while the subject was squeezing the ring and little fingers (9, 21) . A half-passage sin/cos adiabatic observe pulse of 2 ms duration was applied to achieve uniform spin excitation over the sensitive volume of the coil (1). The field homogeneity was adjusted by shimming on water to proton linewidths of \u03fd45 Hz. A spectral width of 2,000 Hz with 2,048 data points was used in all experiments.\nSpin-lattice relaxation time (T 1 ) measurements were performed using a progressive saturation experiment modified to account for chemical exchange (16, 17, 35) . Data were acquired at repetition times (TR) of 0.6 s with 320 acquisitions after 16 dummy scans (spectra in trace d, Fig. 1 , A-C), and at 25 s with 12 acquisitions (spectra in trace a, Fig. 1 , A-C), in the absence of any saturation. A 1-ms homospoil pulse was applied after the data acquisition at the short TR to dephase transverse magnetization (17) .\nThe steady-state saturation transfer experiment was performed both at rest and during exercise. Saturation of the \u2425-ATP resonance was achieved with a 6-s low-power square pulse on the observe channel (16, 17 ; spectra in trace b, Fig.  1 , A-C). Control spectra were obtained by irradiating at an offset contralateral to the PCr resonance (spectra in trace c, Fig. 1, A-C) . The spectra with \u2425-ATP saturation and contralateral irradiation were obtained with TR \u03ed 25 s and 12 acquisitions. Spectra traces a-c were acquired sequentially in one block, with 12 acquisitions. The pseudo-first-order rate constant k (PCr3 ATP) was calculated according to the formula (36)\nwhere T 1 (PCr) is the spin-lattice relaxation time of PCr, M con (PCr) is the steady-state magnetization of PCr in the contralateral saturation experiment, M sat (PCr) is the steadystate magnetization of PCr in the \u2425-ATP saturation experiment, M 0 (PCr) and M 0 (\u2425-ATP) are the equilibrium magnetizations, and M res (\u2425-ATP) is the residual magnetization in the \u2425-ATP saturation experiment. The contralateral saturation resulted in an average attenuation of the PCr resonance by 14%. The product [PCr] k (PCr3 ATP) , which is the phosphorus flux through the CK reaction, was calculated assuming muscle ATP concentration of 8.2 mM (3). This concentration was taken to be unaffected by exercise and to be equal in the young and older subjects (30) .\nAll data were processed with NMR1 software (Tripos, St. Louis, MO). The free induction decays were corrected for DC offset, and a line broadening of 8 Hz was applied. After Fourier transformation and phasing of the spectra, manual baseline correction was performed by use of a polynomial fit. The resulting resonance lines were fit to a Lorentzian shape and integrated.\nThe intracellular pH was calculated from the relative chemical shift of the P i signal with the formula pH \u03ed 6.75 \u03e9 ], and temperature of 38\u00b0C was adjusted for pH (12) . The total creatine concentration was assumed to be 42.5 mM (13) .\nRelative ATP concentration ATP/P total was calculated as a ratio of \u2424-ATP signal intensity and the total phosphorus signal intensity in the fully relaxed spectra.\nExercise protocol. Experiments were conducted on two consecutive days and were performed at rest and during two levels of exercise. On the first day, experiments at rest and with intermittent exercise at 20% MVC were performed; the experiment at 40% MVC was performed on the next day. The MVC was determined before the study, with the subject's arm extended in the magnet bore, and the highest value of three trials was taken. During exercise, subjects squeezed a hand dynamometer with their ring and little fingers every 3 s for 1 s with prompting by an acoustic signal. The subjects were also provided a display indicating the actual intensity of exercise to assist them in maintaining constant exercise intensity throughout the experiment. In the experiments performed during exercise, data acquisition was started 5 min after the initiation of the exercise to allow for establishment of steady-state metabolite levels. The total experimental time, including adjustments for field homogeneity and determination of power of the saturation pulse, did not exceed 30 min.\nStatistical analysis. Data are presented as means \u03ee SD. The data were analyzed by repeated-measures analysis using the mixed-effects modeling procedure (PROC MIXED; SAS, Cary, NC). The variables {T 1 (PCr), PCr/ATP, P i /PCr, k (PCr3 ATP) , free [ADP], pH, and forward phosphorus flux through the CK reaction} were expressed as a function of age group, exercise level (rest, 20% exercise, and 40% exercise), gender, and interaction terms (exercise level \u03eb gender, age group \u03eb gender, age group \u03eb exercise level, and age group \u03eb gender \u03eb exercise level). The Fisher method (31) was applied for post hoc analysis. The correlations of k (PCr3 ATP) , forward phosphorus flux through the CK reaction, free [ADP], PCr/ ATP, P i /PCr, and pH were examined with linear regression analysis. Statistical significance in all tests was taken as P \u03fd 0.05."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Representative", "text": "31 P MR spectra of the FDP at rest, 20% MVC, and 40% MVC are shown in Fig. 1 , A-C. The data summary is presented in Table 1 .\nMetabolite concentrations and pH. No significant effects of age or gender on P i /PCr, PCr/ATP, ATP/P total , free [ADP], or pH were detected.\nWe found a significant effect of exercise on PCr/ ATP, P i /PCr, and pH (all P \u03fd 0.01; mixed effects model). Data at 20% MVC exercise were obtained in 9 young and 12 older subjects. All subjects maintained a constant level of force within 10%. Post hoc analysis revealed a significant increase in P i /PCr (P \u03fd 0.01 and P \u03fd 0.05 in the young and older groups, respectively) at 20% MVC exercise compared with values measured at rest. We also observed a small decrease in the average PCr/ATP and intracellular pH in both groups, but the difference between the values obtained at rest and during 20% MVC exercise did not reach statistical significance. Data at 40% MVC exercise were obtained in 8 young and 11 older subjects. Two subjects in the young group and five subjects in the older group experienced significant fatigue during the exercise; their relative force levels decreased below 30% MVC. However, because no differences in average measured variables {PCr/ATP, P i /PCr, ATP/P total , free [ADP], pH, k (PCr3 ATP) , forward CK phosphorus flux} were found between the subjects experiencing fatigue and those not experiencing fatigue in both young and older groups, the data on all subjects in both groups were averaged together. In both groups, exercise at 40% MVC resulted in a significant decrease in intracellular pH, compared with the values obtained at rest (P \u03fd 0.05) and at 20% MVC (P \u03fd 0.05) ( Table 1) . P i /PCr was significantly higher in both groups compared with resting values (P \u03fd 0.01 in both groups). The difference in P i /PCr between 40% MVC exercise and 20% MVC exercise also reached statistical significance in the older group (P \u03fd 0.05). A further nonsignificant decline in the average value of PCr/ ATP compared with the exercise at 20% MVC was found in both age groups. No significant effect of exercise level on free [ADP] was found. Similarly, ATP/P total did not change between rest and exercise (Table 1) .\nCK reaction rates and phosphorus fluxes through the CK reaction. Statistical analysis of k (PCr3 ATP) and the phosphorus flux revealed a significant interaction between age and gender (both P \u03fd 0.01), indicating that the gender effect on k (PCr3 ATP) and the phosphorus flux was different in the young and older groups. Post hoc analyses showed that young men had a lower overall average [calculated from all data measured at rest and exercise; k (PCr3 ATP) \u03ed 0.07 \u03ee 0.04 s ; both P \u03fd 0.05]. No differences between young and older female subjects were detected.\nExercise had a significant effect on both reaction rate k (PCr3 ATP) and phosphorus flux through the CK reaction (both P \u03fd 0.01; mixed effects model). At 20% MVC, the reaction rate k (PCr3 ATP) increased in both age groups compared with the average value at rest (P \u03fd 0.05). This increase in k (PCr3 ATP) resulted in a 50% higher average forward phosphorus flux in the young group (P \u03fd 0.10) and a 79.8% higher average forward phosphorus flux in the older group (P \u03fd 0.05). At 40% MVC exercise, the average k (PCr3 ATP) was unchanged in the older group and somewhat lower in the young group [not significant (NS)] compared with exercise at 20% MVC. We also observed a decrease in the average forward CK phosphorus flux at 40% MVC compared with 20% MVC (NS).\nThe linear regression analysis showed a significant dependence of k (PCr3 ATP) on PCr/ATP (slope \u03ea0.026 s"}, {"section_title": "\u03ea1", "text": "; P \u03fd 0.01), P i /PCr (slope 0.178 s\n; P \u03fd 0.001), and pH (slope \u03ea0.13 s\n; P \u03fd 0.01). We also found a linear relationship between phosphorus flux and free [ADP] (slope \u03ea20.4 s\n; P \u03fd 0.01). We also note that large standard deviations in metabolite concentrations, reaction rates, and CK phosphorus fluxes found in our study (Table 1) may be due to an interindividual variability in measures of intracellular bioenergetics (23) .\nT 1 (PCr) . Throughout the experiment, we did not observe any significant effect of age and exercise on T 1 (PCr). The statistical analysis of T 1 (PCr) revealed a significant effect of gender (P \u03fd 0.05). The overall average (calculated from all data measured at rest and exercise) in men (T 1 \u03ed 6.50 \u03ee 1.11 s) was higher than in women (T 1 \u03ed 5.81 \u03ee 1.52 s; P \u03fd 0.05). Data are presented as means \u03ee SD. Rest, n \u03ed 11 (young), n \u03ed 20 (older); 20% maximum voluntary contraction (MVC), n \u03ed 9 (young), n \u03ed 12 (older); 40% MVC, n \u03ed 8 (young), n \u03ed 11 (older). Phosphocreatine PCr/ATP and P i /PCr were calculated from the ratio of signal intensities of P i , PCr, and \u2424-ATP in the spectra obtained at repetition times (TR) \u03ed 25 s. Relative ATP concentration ATP/P total was calculated as a ratio of \u2424-ATP signal intensity and the total phosphorus signal intensity in the spectra measured with TR \u03ed 25 s. Creatine kinase flux was calculated assuming ATP concentration of 8.2 mM. Post hoc analysis: * P \u03fd 0.05 vs. the value measured at rest; \u2020 P \u03fd 0.01 vs. the value measured at rest; \u2021 P \u03fd 0.05 vs. the value measured at 20% MVC. 31 P MR spectroscopy. The decline in muscular strength and performance with age has been well documented (8, 26) . In vivo 31 P MR spectroscopy, which permits the noninvasive detection of high-energy phosphates and intracellular pH, has been used extensively to examine muscle bioenergetics in many settings (7) . However, the results of 31 P MRS studies on aged human muscle, performed both at rest and at exercise, have been contradictory. One early study comparing the metabolism of forearm muscle at rest and during exercise and recovery found no difference between elderly and young subjects (37) , in agreement with our previous results (20, 39) . However, subsequent investigations in which measurements were made on leg musculature found that older subjects had a lower resting PCr/P i (28, 33) and PCr/ATP (38) than did younger subjects, indicating a lower phosphorylation potential. After exercise, a lower PCr recovery rate in the elderly was detected in one investigation in which the workload was not individually adjusted for each subject (28) . A later study reported no differences in PCr recovery between young and older subjects when the workload was individually adjusted for lean body mass (38) . Similarly, no age-related effect on PCr recovery after progressive exercise was found in a recent study on PCr kinetics in young and older subjects (4). In related work, a lower intracellular pH threshold relative to peak work rate was found in older subjects; however, the study did not fully account for differences in muscle strength among the subjects (5). Differences in fiber type composition between young and older subjects might account for some of the observed differences among the published studies. Direct fiber measurements have demonstrated no significant difference in fiber type distribution in the gastrocnemius muscle with age (6, 19) . In contrast, lower mitochondrial enzyme activities in aged muscle found in the same studies (6, 19) suggest a decrease with age in oxidative metabolic capacity. Because the fiber type composition of the forearm flexors and the gastrocnemius muscle is similar (22) , the discrepancy between our results (present study, 20, 39) and other work (28, 33, 38) is likely to be due to other age-related changes, such as deconditioning, which may be of greater significance in the lower than in the upper extremity.\n. Using the same methodology, we previously reported k (PCr3 ATP) \u03ed 0.2 s \u03ea1 in rat skeletal muscle at rest (17) , in agreement with literature values (15, 34) . The lower value of the CK reaction rate in human skeletal muscle found in our study is consistent with the nearly twofold smaller CK catalytic activity compared with rat skeletal muscle (25) . The comparable but somewhat larger k (PCr3 ATP) value of 0.2 s \u03ea1 found in previous studies of CK reaction kinetics in young healthy volunteers may be attributable in part to differences in study populations.\nAside from these potential physiological differences, discrepancies between this work and previous studies may result from the different experimental methodology employed. In contrast to an earlier study of the forearm (32), we carefully accounted for incomplete saturation in saturation transfer experiments. As previously shown (36) , even apparently small degrees of incomplete saturation may result in large errors in reaction rate measurements. In addition, we determined T 1 (PCr) using a rapid and reliable method that does not require selective saturation of a resonance. This allowed us to determine T 1 (PCr), and thus the CK reaction rate, in each individual, both at rest and at each of the two exercise levels, without making the assumption of equal T 1 (PCr) among individuals and between rest and exercise (32) . Although one study on human calf (13) attempted to use progressive saturation to determine T 1 (PCr), the effect of chemical exchange between PCr and \u2425-ATP was not accounted for. We have previously shown that this can lead to a large underestimate of T 1 (PCr) (16) . Indeed, T 1 (PCr) was found to be 50% lower in the resting muscle in this earlier work (13) compared with our current results, in which the effect of chemical exchange between PCr and \u2425-ATP has been accounted for. An underestimate of T 1 (PCr) results directly in an overestimate of the CK reaction rate, consistent with the differences found between previous work (13) and the present study. The differences in measured T 1 (PCr) may be accounted for by different magnetic fields used, although magnetic field differences do not result in changes in reaction rates.\nExercise at 20% MVC resulted in an increase in the k (PCr3 ATP) in both subject groups (P \u03fd 0.05) and an increase in the forward phosphorus flux (P \u03fd 0.05 in the older group, P \u03fd 0.10 in the young group). In comparison with exercise at 20% MVC, we found a decrease (NS) in the forward CK flux at the 40% MVC exercise level in both groups. A similar decrease in forward CK flux was also observed in previous studies of human forearm and gastrocnemius muscles (13, 32) . In contrast to previous studies (13, 32) , in our current study the pH at the highest exercise level was significantly lower in both groups compared with the resting state, reflecting the high intensity of the exercise protocol that we used. The present results of a decreased phosphorus flux through the CK reaction at the highest workload are also consistent with those in stimulated rat muscle (24, 34) . In all cases, the results argue against functional increase in CK flux in response to increasing workload, as has been reported in perfused hearts (2, 14) . There are a number of possible explanations, as outlined previously (13) . Modeling studies demonstrate that a decrease in [ADP] , consistent with the trend we observed in the older group with increasing exercise load, may result in decreased CK flux (13) . Indeed, we found a statistically significant decrease in flux with increasing [ADP] . Local alterations in [ADP] may result directly from intracellular heterogeneity; however, this possibility cannot be directly assessed by our measurements. Direct loss of enzymatic activity could also result from membrane damage as a result of the strenuous exercise protocol undertaken; this would be reflected in the decreased CK flux at high workload. A further possibility is the accumulation of inhibiting metabolites, such as P i and protons (41) . In addition, the observed flux pattern may reflect the effect of anion complexes. For further discussion, see the study by Goudemant et al. (13) .\nIn conclusion, CK reaction flux did not vary monotonically with workload in the forearm muscle of healthy young and older subjects. No differences in this variation were found between young and older subjects, despite the application of physiological stress sufficient to reduce intracellular pH and PCr/ATP and thus probe metabolic reserve. Our results thus suggest that aging does not significantly affect the metabolic processes associated with the CK reaction."}, {"section_title": "Effect of age on muscle metabolism as detected by", "text": "The current study differs from previous work in many methodological respects. Rather than performing the same absolute amount of work, all subjects, carefully screened healthy volunteers, performed at the same workload relative to their individual maximum. Thus we attempted to obtain results that reflect intrinsic metabolism rather than extrinsic variables such as muscle mass and absolute strength. Furthermore, in the current study, we measured CK reaction kinetics rather than steady-state metabolite concentrations. Measurement of the CK reaction rate provides a more sensitive test for monitoring muscle high-energy phosphate metabolism than simple measurement of relative metabolite concentrations, as typically performed with MRS.\nCK reaction rate and phosphorus flux at rest and exercise.
