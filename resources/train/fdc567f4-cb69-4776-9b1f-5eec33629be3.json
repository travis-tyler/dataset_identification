[{"section_title": "", "text": "more, barotropic global storm tide models can be used as components of Earth System Models to analyze risks posed by the long-term response of extreme sea level and coastal flooding to climate change in far greater detail than currently possible (Bouwer, 2018;Vousdoukas et al., 2018). A key practical advantage of ocean models discretized using FEM as compared to FVM is that they are usually less sensitive to mesh quality (e.g., element skewness). Specifically, ocean models discretized using FMV often use staggered C-grid arrangements (e.g., Delft-FM) that have strict grid orthogonality requirements for numerical accuracy (Danilov, 2013;Fringer et al., 2019). The orthogonal requirement makes mesh generation over wide areas with fractal shoreline boundaries an arduous task and is difficult to automate, although progress has been made (Herzfeld et al., 2020;Hoch et al., 2020). Despite the difficulties, the FVM Delft-FM (Flexible Mesh) based Global Tide and Surge model (GTSM) (Verlaan et al., 2015), has been meticulously developed and widely used to generate reanalysis datasets, describe historical trends, and make projections of extreme sea levels (Muis et al., 2016;Vousdoukas et al., 2018;Muis et al., 2019;Dullaart et al., 2019). The minimum (coastal) resolution of GTSM has been historically limited to \u223c5 km but recently upgraded to 2.5 km (1.25 km in Europe) (Dullaart et al., 2019). In the absence of constraints on orthogonality or element skewness, automatically generating unstructured triangular meshes on the spherical Earth that accurately conform to the coastline and cover a wide-range of spatial sales [O(10 m)-O(10 km)] is completely realisable (Legrand et al., 2000;Gorman et al., 2006;Lambrechts et al., 2008;Roberts et al., 2019a). In one study, automatically generated ocean basin-scale meshes with variable element sizes (50 m to 10 km) were used to conduct dozens of numerically stable FEM simulation experiments without mesh hand-edits or numerical limiters (Roberts et al., 2019b). The ability of FEM models to handle rapid transitions in mesh element sizes combined with the ease of mesh generation with modern technologies (e.g., Roberts et al., 2019a) enables the application of seamless local refinement directly into the global mesh where required, potentially on-the-fly based on atmospheric and ocean conditions that indicate a risk of coastal flooding. This study conducts a systematic analysis of unstructured mesh design in order to assess and demonstrate the capabilities of global storm tide modeling using FEMs across multi-resolution scales spanning from the deep ocean to the nearshore coastal ocean environment. One outcome of this study is a recommendation of unstructured triangular-element mesh design of the global ocean that represents the barotropic physics with high fidelity using relatively few elements (Sect. 3.1). Moreover, we test the added benefit of seamless local refinement in storm landfall regions to the simulation of storm tides (Sect. 3.2). Mesh generation is handled by the OceanMesh2D toolbox (Roberts et al., 2019a) which provides the tools to explore the effects of mesh design in a systematic way. For simulation we use the ADvanced CIRCulation (ADCIRC) model (Luettich and Westerink, 2004), which has been updated in this study for efficiency and to correctly model the SWEs on the sphere (Sect. 2.1); set for release as version 55. Section 3.3 summarizes the timing results with ADCIRC v55, highlighting its computational efficiency. https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2020-123 Preprint. Discussion started: 28 July 2020 c Author(s) 2020.

ADCIRC solves the SWEs that are composed of primitive continuity and non-conservative depth-averaged momentum equations under astronomical and atmospherical forcing. After neglecting radial velocity terms, we formulate these equations in spherical coordinates as follows (Kolar et al., 1994), where \u03b6 is the free surface, U and V are the depth-averaged zonal and meridional velocities respectively, H is the total water depth, t is time, \u03bb is longitude, \u03c6 is latitude, R is the radius of the Earth, and \u03c1 0 is the reference density of water.

C is the internal wave drag tensor that accounts for the energy conversion from barotropic to baroclinic modes through internal tide generation in the deep ocean (Garrett and Kunze, 2007). Here, the local generation formulation is used (cf. Pringle et al., 2018a, b), in which C it is a global tuning coefficient, N b and N m are the seabed and depth-averaged buoyancy frequencies respectively, \u03c9 is set to the angular frequency of the M 2 tide, and \u2207h \u03bb , \u2207h \u03c6 are the zonal and meridional topographic gradients respectively.

To properly compute the governing equations on the spherical Earth in the FEM framework used by ADCIRC, we have upgraded the model formulation and code as detailed in Sect. S1 of the supplementary document. This involves rotating the Earth so that the pole singularity is removed (Sect. S1.3) before applying a rectilinear mapping projection to transform the governing equations into a Cartesian form with spherical-based corrections to the spatial derivatives (Sect. S1.1). Here, the continuity equation is multiplied by a factor dependent on the choice of cylindrical projection used (e.g., Mercator) to produce a conservative form that leads to discrete mass conservation and stability (cf. Hervouet, 2007;Castro et al., 2018) (Sect. S1.2). The stability of the ADCIRC solution scheme (Sect. S1.4) was analyzed in one-dimensional linear form (Sect. S1.5) to provide guidelines for the choice of numerical parameters that can be chosen to remove the gravity-wave based (CFL) constraint. The validity of this analysis in the 2D nonlinear form has been demonstrated through the numerical simulations presented in this paper. With a semi-implicit time integration scheme, computational time steps (up to 120s) permitted are much larger than the CFL constraint and as a result facilitate computationally efficient global simulations.

Mesh design is handled through mesh size (resolution distribution) functions that are defined on a regular structured grid, usually that of the topo-bathymetric digital elevation model (DEM). In this study we use functions based on distance-toshoreline, bathymetric depths, and topographic gradients (see Table 1 for definitions). The final mesh size function is found by taking the minimum of all individual functions, and applying nominal minimum and maximum mesh resolution bounds and a element-to-element gradation limiter to bound the transition rate (Roberts et al., 2019a). The effects of the individual mesh size functions and bounds on barotropic tides in a regional model have been previously detailed in Roberts et al. (2019b), which we use to guide our experiments exploring mesh design. Additionally, this study makes use of the OceanMesh2D \"plus\" function which seamlessly merges two arbitrary meshes together keeping the finer resolution in the overlapping region. We use this function to apply local mesh refinement to a global mesh in storm-affected coastal regions to better resolve semi-enclosed bays and lakes, inlets, backbays, channels, and other small-scale shoreline geometries."}, {"section_title": "Experimental Design", "text": "The experimental design we pursue is composed of two distinct steps, both with the purpose to maximize model efficiency while maintaining a threshold of accuracy. First, we begin with a mesh design that we assume is a highly-refined discretization of the Earth in a global sense, and systematically relax the mesh size parameters to reduce the total number of mesh vertices while trying to minimize any negative impacts on global model accuracy. Second, we take the resulting recommended global mesh design from the previous step, and apply local mesh refinement to increase the coastal resolution in the storm landfalling region and potentially improve local model accuracy.  Table 2). In the Ref design, MinEle is set to 1.5 km mainly due to practical constraints (e.g., computer memory usage when generating a global mesh in OceanMesh2D), and MaxEle is set to 25 km because common global meteorological products are defined on \u223c25 km grids (aliasing errors in interpolation of the meteorological input data becomes an issue when a coarser grid is considered). The parameters WL, D, and G are considered fixed for all mesh designs based on prior knowledge that \u223c30 elements per wavelength (WL) is sufficient for global ocean tides (Greenberg et al., 2007), and an element-to-element gradation limit/distance expansion rate (G and D) as high as 0.35 is tolerable as long as the TLS mesh size function is applied (Roberts et al., 2019b). As a note, the FL parameter is used in the construction of the TLS mesh size function to filter out small-scale topographic features (c.f., Table 1) that are potentially unimportant to the local barotropic physics, thus disregarding those features for the application of higher resolution. This study is the first to test the effect of the FL parameter in detail. In each mesh design perturbation, only one of the three parameters is changed while the other parameters are kept identical to those used in the Ref design. For illustration, the spatial distribution of resolution of the Ref design compared to the TLS-B design is shown in Fig. 1. To assess the effect on the global model accuracy as the mesh designs are coarsened, we compare simulated astronomical tidal solutions to the data-assimilated TPXO9-Atlas. We focus on astronomical tides in this step because they can be reduced to a series of harmonic constituents of well-defined frequencies to make systematic global comparisons (Roberts et al., 2019b;Pringle et al., 2018a). The TPXO9-Atlas is the latest release of the TPXO satellite-assimilated tidal model (Egbert and Erofeeva, 2002). According to Egbert and Erofeeva (2019), the mean M 2 RMSE t (tidal root-mean-square error, see Appendix A for definition) is 0.

We choose to focus on a particularly significant historical storm event from each of the Atlantic and Pacific ocean basins where tropical cyclones most commonly occur: 2. Western Pacific -Super Typhoon Haiyan, November 3-11, 2013. The most severe impact of storm tide induced coastal flooding occurred in and around Tacloban, Philippines at the back end of the Leyte Gulf (Mori et al., 2014). Local mesh refinement is achieved by using OceanMesh2D to automatically merge a locally generated mesh for each landfall region (Louisiana/Mississippi: Fig. 2, Leyte Gulf: Fig. 3) into the global mesh. Two local meshes are generated for each region: one with MinEle = 500 m and another with MinEle = 150 m. The other mesh size function parameters are kept the same as the global mesh design, except that G and D are reduced to 0.25 because the mesh quality generated in the local domain was considered too low with a value of 0.35. Furthermore, the locally refined meshes only add an additional 0.5-3% to the total mesh vertex count compared to the original global mesh design, thus there is limited motivation to use higher values of G and D to try and save on mesh vertices in the local refinement region. To assess the accuracy and inter-compare mesh designs, we primarily use the output of the maximum simulated storm tide elevation from each event. For validation we compare to surveys of high-water marks (HWMs) in the landfall regions that are located close to the coast (within 1.5 km of the nearest 150-m locally refined mesh vertex) and attributed primarily to surge for both Katrina (URS Group Inc, 2006a, b) and Haiyan (Mori et al., 2014). Note that for Katrina we add a value of 0.23 m to the simulated storm tide elevations to account for a steric offset and the conversion to NAVD88 vertical datum from local mean sea level (Bunya et al., 2010). No adjustment is made for Haiyan. The standard RMSE, the mean absolute error (MAE) and its standard deviation (SD) are reported. In addition, for Katrina we plot the storm tide time series signal at three coastal NOAA tide gauges with available historical data (IDs: 8735180, 8743281, 8761724). For Haiyan, no reliable time series observations of the main event are available (Mori et al., 2014), so we compare to the astronomical tide reconstructed from TPXO9-Atlas constituents at three selected locations for reference.

These five constituents are chosen so that we can use a relatively short 28-day harmonic analysis period (Ngodock et al., 2016), which would otherwise need to be extended to around 180 days if other constituents are included because of the closeness in their frequencies (e.g., K 1 and P 1 ) (Pringle et al., 2018a).

In particular, M 2 amphidromes in the high latitude regions are largely corrected such that any disparities between TPXO9-Atlas and our updated model solutions are qualitatively hard to discern from a global perspective (Fig. 5). Moreover, M 2 RMSE t is less than 2.5 cm over most of the ocean with the largest remaining deep ocean hotspot in the North Atlantic (Fig. 6). Indeed, deep ocean M 2 RMSE t = 2.87 cm (Table 3), which is smaller than those previously computed for non-assimilated barotropic tidal models (Stammer et al., 2014;Schindelegger et al., 2018), and within the range of errors computed for solutions obtained by embedding a state ensemble Kalman Filter (perturbed data assimilation) into a forward ocean circulation model (Ngodock et al., 2016). Furthermore, the 5-constituent total tidal error, RMSE t|tot , is less than 4 cm in the deep ocean. In shallow regions, the M 2 RMSE t is 13.9 cm, which is slightly smaller than obtained in Schindelegger et al. (2018), and RMSE t|tot is 17.2 cm.

See Table 2 for mesh design details."}, {"section_title": "Solution Variability with Global Mesh Design Parameters", "text": "The distribution (ECDF curves) of RMSE t|tot degrades as the mesh size function parameters are relaxed (Fig. 7). Most of this degradation occurs in the body of the distribution rather than the tails. This characteristic implies that the K test statistic is a good metric of disparity between mesh designs (Fig. 8) because it measures the greatest vertical distance between ECDF curves which has a greater chance of being larger in the body. K is positive for all mesh designs indicating that the Ref mesh is indeed statistically the best performing mesh. Increasing MinEle has a clear but gradual degenerative effect on the solution as it is increased from 1.5 km to 3 km. The disparities in the ECDF curves noticeably grow as MinEle is increased to 6 km; the value of K increases from 0.057 for 3 km to 0.175 for 6 km. In comparison, the ECDF curves and the value of K is changed comparatively little as the TLS parameter is decreased from 20 to 5 (K is just 0.032 for TLS = 5). In fact, the solutions are close to identical for TLS values of 10 and 20. However, as the TLS function is turned off (TLS = 0), the solution is severely degraded and the value of K is the greatest for any mesh design (= 0.257). The effect of using the FL function and relaxing the parameter on the ECDF curves is fairly gradual overall, however the magnitude of this change is not trivial; K is increased to 0.070 for FL = 1/5. In summary, the results demonstrate that decreasing the TLS parameter from 20 through to 5 substantially decreases the number of vertices while it has a relatively small effect on the tidal solution compared to the other experiments. On the other hand, increasing the FL parameter has a comparatively small impact on vertex count reduction, while increasing MinEle has a relatively large impact on the solution. The final choice of mesh design is dependent on one's tolerance for error, but in general it is preferable to choose a mesh that is plotted close to bottom-left corner of the graph in Fig. 8. Following this logic, the TLS-B mesh design (MinEle = 1.5 km, TLS = 5, FL = 0) appears to be the most efficient one tested (see Fig. 6 for the spatial distribution of M 2 RMSE t on this mesh). The results also suggest that combinations of MinEle larger than 1.5 km (\u223c2.25-3 km) and a TLS parameter smaller than 20 (\u223c5-10) could be employed to potentially lead to an efficient mesh design.  Table 2). Nevertheless, using a small MinEle is in and of itself useful to provide extra coastal resolution, which may be more important as we consider local storm tide accuracy. Thus, TLS-B is chosen as the base mesh design in Sect. 3.2."}, {"section_title": "Local Mesh Refinement", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Validation on the 150-m Locally-Refined Meshes", "text": "The maximum storm tide elevation due to Hurricane Katrina approaches 8 m in the Hancock and Harrison Counties of Mississippi ( Fig. 9a), comparable to previously conducted high-fidelity simulation results (Dietrich et al., 2009). For Super Typhoon Haiyan, the maximum storm tide elevation exceeds 6 m near Tacloban due to local amplification in the Leyte Gulf (Fig. 9b), similar to previous simulation results (Mori et al., 2014). Qualitatively good agreement with the plotted HWMs is demonstrated for both storms with a few exceptions. As pointed out by Mori et al. (2014), since inundation is not simulated and the effects of wave setup are ignored in these simulations we expect the maximum storm tide height to match the lower envelope of observed HWMs due to the amplification by topography. By numbering the HWMs starting at the most southwest point and following the shoreline clockwise, it is indeed illustrated that the simulation results tend to mach the lower envelope of observed HWMs quite closely (Fig. 10). For Katrina, the MAE = 1.06 m (SD = 0.66 m) (see  Time series of Hurricane Katrina at NOAA tide gauges show that the timing of the peak storm tide elevation and the amplitude and phase of the tide signal prior to landfall are well represented by the model (Fig. 11). The modeled peak is underestimated by \u223c0.4 m at gauge 8735180, and at gauge 8743281 where the largest peak storm tide occurred, tide gauge recording was interrupted as the storm was making landfall, but the simulation closely follows the observations up until this point. A roughly constant discrepancy of \u223c0.4-0.5 m between the simulation and observation develops at the gauges following the last high tide prior to storm landfall, likely explaining the underestimate at gauge 8735180 (by this logic the peak may be overestimated at 8761724). Comparing to time series of simulations with wind wave-coupling (Roberts and Cobell, 2017), it appears that this discrepancy can be attributed to wave setup effects that are ignored here. Time series of Super Typhoon Haiyan also show that the amplitude and phasing of the tide at the selected locations are fairly well represented as compared to the TPXO9-Atlas (Fig. 11). Storm tide heights at Tacloban are dominated by the short and intense surge event but the duration of surge is likely underestimated because the parametric vortex model lacks background winds. Due to the timing of the storm landfall during the lower high tide, peak storm tides exceeded the higher high tide by just 0.5 m at Guiuan. In fact for Guiuan and Canuay Island the minimum storm tide levels were more severe than the peak levels."}, {"section_title": "Solution Variability with Local Mesh Refinement", "text": "Our results indicate that there is a tendency for the coarser resolution meshes to have larger storm tide elevations in the open coastal areas of the landfall region. In the case of the Katrina, this is most clearly seen in Lake Borgne where maximum storm tide elevations are at least 0.6 m larger on the MinEle = 1.5 km mesh than those on the MinEle = 500 m mesh, and approximately https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2020-123 Preprint.

Interestingly, neither the MinEle = 1.5 km mesh or the MinEle = 500 m mesh includes Lake Pontchartrain, while the MinEle = 150 mesh does (Fig. 2). This is because the Rigolets strait connecting Lake Pontchartrain to Lake Borgne is approximately 500 m at its narrowest, thus the MinEle = 500 m mesh is at the cutoff point for meshing the strait and providing hydraulic connectivity between the two lakes. Yet, the maximum elevation difference from Lake Borgne across to Mobile Bay between MinEle = 1.5 km and MinEle = 500 m is still much greater than between MinEle = 500 m and MinEle = 150 m (refer time series at gauges 8735180 and 8743281 in Fig. 11 in addition to Fig. 12). Nevertheless, since the MinEle = 150 m is the only mesh to resolve Lake Pontchartrain, the HWMs surrounding the lake (point numbers 7-23) can only be reasonably estimated by simulations on this mesh, resulting in the smallest HWM error statistics (Fig. 10a). In the case of the Haiyan, the predominant maximum storm tide elevation difference (\u223c0.4-0.6 m) is located at the back of Leyte Gulf near Tacloban between the MinEle = 1.5 km and MinEle = 500 m meshes (Figs. 11 and 13). The decrease in elevations in the MinEle = 1.5 km mesh might be explained by the omission of the San Juanico Strait (\u223c800 m wide at its narrowest, Figure 3). In contrast, the elevations near Tacloban and in the strait increase by up to 0.6 m as the MinEle = 500 m mesh is refined to MinEle = 150 m. There is also a reduction in the elevations (by up to 0.2 m) just offshore of the Leyte Gulf along the shelf break for the coarser meshes, which is better represented in the higher resolution renditions. Overall, the choice of local MinEle has a small effect on the representation of HWMs for Haiyan (Fig. 10b). The only major noticeable impact is for the HWMs near Tacloban in the San Juanico Strait (point numbers 25-63) on the MinEle = 1.5 km mesh. Since this mesh does not resolve the strait, the simulated estimate of the HWMs here are all taken from the same or nearby mesh vertices at the back of the gulf. Lastly, we mention two additional general observations. First, for both storms the far-field effects of local mesh refinement were found to be negligible. Second, storm tide elevation time series show that the not only does the peak elevation tend to decrease as mesh refinement is made, but the timing of the peak also tends to occur later (Fig. 11) -most clearly illustrated for gauge 8735180."}, {"section_title": "Computational Performance", "text": "For all astronomical tide simulations performed in the global mesh design experiments (Sect. 3.1) the time step, \u2206t, was set to 120 s, which is equivalent to a Courant (CFL) number of 5-22 on the global mesh designs used in this study (see Sect. S1.5 for model stability details). The resulting computational wallclock times for the astronomical tide simulations ranged from 5 s to 30 s per simulation day depending on the total vertex count of the mesh (Fig. 14). All simulations were computed on 480 Haswell processors with a Mellanox FDR Infiniband network connection. For the storm tide simulations performed in the local mesh refinement experiments (Sect. 3.2) the time step had to be reduced for finer meshes due to model instability related to nonlinear terms that are treated explicitly which become more significant as element sizes nearshore (in shallow depths) are reduced. For Katrina, the time step for the MinEle = 150 m mesh had to be reduced to 40 s. For Haiyan, the time step had to be reduced for both the MinEle = 500 m (\u2206t = 90 s) and the MinEle = 150 m (\u2206t = 25 s) mesh. The resulting computational wallclock times were increased for the smaller time steps (Fig. 14). However, the simulations on the MinEle = 150 m meshes were proportionally around two times faster per \u2206t compared to the coarser meshes. This is attributed to the heavy I/O related to reading meteorological data during the simulation that limits computational speed-up as time steps are increased beyond a certain value. In fact, for the same \u2206t, wallclock times for the storm tide simulations were 2-3 times longer than the astronomical tide runs which require I/O only at the very beginning and end of the simulation. Furthermore, the Haiyan simulations were slightly slower than Katrina simulations because of the higher resolution of the reanalysis meteorology (c.f., Sect. 2.4). In addition, the computational performance of our Katrina simulations are compared to previous ADCIRC model ones (Bunya et al., 2010;Dietrich et al., 2011), which employed \u2206t = 1 s leading to wallclock times one-to-two orders of magnitude greater than those in this study (Fig. 14). We remark that the Bunya et al. (2010); Dietrich et al. (2011) studies used finer mesh sizes (MinEle = 50 m) and included the floodplain leading to more wetting-drying, which can be a source of numerical instability. Our results nonetheless indicate the potential for substantial computational speed-up on suitably designed meshes."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Results from the global mesh design experiments echo those found previously for a regional mesh of the Western North Atlantic Ocean (Roberts et al., 2019b).

The computational performance in this study using ADCIRC v55 is contrasted with previous ADCIRC model Katrina storm tide simulations (Bunya et al., 2010;Dietrich et al., 2011) that required very small time steps (\u2206t = 1 s). of 35% used here, the TLS function is critical to ensure that water elevation solutions remain accurate by adequately resolving topographic features of importance. The relatively high value of G ensures that the mesh size rapidly enlarges in areas where no topographic gradient features exist to help avoid excessive mesh vertex counts. An interesting point of difference that we note in this study is the interplay between MinEle and TLS. MinEle not only controls the minimum coastal resolution but it 325 also controls the minimum resolution that can be applied along topographic gradient features in the TLS function. Here, the MinEle ranged between 1.5 km and 6 km which affected the strength of the TLS function in these mesh designs. Nevertheless, the MinEle-C design (MinEle = 6 km) was still superior to the TLS-C one (TLS = 0). There may be additional sensitivity to the TLS function at MinEle less than 1.5 km although it is likely quite small. In Roberts et al. (2019b), MinEle = 1 km was used along the outer shelf and shelf break and this appeared to be sufficient."}, {"section_title": "330", "text": "The results also show that the use of the barotropic Rossby radius-based low-pass filter (FL) in the TLS function is able to reduce mesh vertices without substantially degrading the solution.

Combinations of TLS values between 5-10 with FL (=1/80-1/20) could also be applied depending on the tolerance to the solution accuracy. Using the FL parameter in more highly resolved local domains may also provide benefits to avoid over-resolving topographic slopes in shallow depths. However, it must also be recognized that length scales of importance transition from Rossby radius scaling in the open ocean to those of shoreline features nearshore (LeBlond, 1991). Therefore, a more intelligent low-pass filter may be necessary for such applications. The astronomical tide solution differences between global mesh designs were shown to be predominantly in the body of the area-weighted ECDF curves while the tails were almost identical. This implies that simulated tides over most of the area of the ocean are affected by mesh resolution. However, in regions where the tidal range and error is large, which inevitably occurs on shallow shelves, all of the mesh designs have similarly large errors. This perhaps explains why a 1/12 \u2022 tidal model (Schindelegger et al., 2018) could obtain a similar M 2 RMSE t in shallow waters to our more highly resolved reference mesh (14.6 cm compared to 13.9 cm). There is likely an inherent uncertainty in the bathymetry and dissipation which prevents further decrease to the shallow water RMSE t which can be dominated by large errors (in shallow water the area-weighted median RMSE t|tot is much smaller than RMSE t ). Indeed, the deep ocean M 2 RMSE t was 4.4 cm in Schindelegger et al. (2018), 53% larger than the 2.87 cm on our Ref mesh. The local mesh refinement technique was demonstrated to be a useful tool to provide high refinement with a trivial addition to the total vertex count. Nevertheless, the numerically stable time step often has to be reduced as coastal mesh resolution becomes finer, which increases computational time. The impact of mesh refinement clearly tends to decrease open ocean storm tide elevations in open ocean areas, but overall the impacts to the HWM errors were relatively small, especially for Super Typhoon Haiyan. The presence of more inland lakes and semi-enclosed bays separated by narrow inlets in the Louisiana region meant that simulated Hurricane Katrina HWM estimates in these features were poor unless the MinEle was sufficient to resolve these narrow passages and provide hydraulic connectivity. A recent study using the GTSM global model with \u223c5 km coastal refinement (MinEle = 5 km) was used to characterize the spatiotemporal variability of storm-driven surges along western North Atlantic coasts including surge due to Hurricane Katrina (Muis et al., 2019). Our results would suggest that coarser resolution meshes are be able to reproduce the broader features of surge along open coastal areas quite well. However, such a model cannot be used to predict storm tide levels within the semi-enclosed bays and lakes in the Louisiana region. Furthermore, MinEle = 5 km is above the limit where global astronomical tide solutions appear to diverge noticeably from MinEle = 1.5 km meshes. Last, it is widely recognized that sensitivities to local high resolution bathymetry datasets, and spatially varying bottom friction and surface ice friction are important (Lefevre et al., 2000;Le Bars et al., 2010;Zaron, 2017;Pringle et al., 2018a;Zaron, 2019), likely more so than the mesh resolution effects that we concentrate on here. We aim to develop a unified framework for calibrating bottom friction globally with improved local high resolution bathymetric datasets in future work. Moreover, we did not simulate inundation in this study, but it will be a crucial future step so that we can forecast and assess coastal flood risks for all of Earth's coasts. Important upgrades to the FEM SWE solver, ADCIRC, have been presented to improve accuracy and efficiency for global storm tide modeling across multi-resolution unstructured meshes. We systemically tested the new model's (ADCIRC v55) sensitivity to mesh design in the simulation of global astronomical tides and storm tides. These mesh design results are expected to be broadly applicable to other SWE solvers that correctly handle solutions on the sphere. Based on the results for global mesh design we recommend to aim for a minimum element size less than 3 km and to use the TLS function to resolve topographic gradient features with a TLS value of 5-10. Paired with the OceanMesh2D software, the ability to seamlessly apply local refinement allows the user to provide fine coastal resolution in the region of interest (e.g., the storm landfall region) without large increases to the total mesh vertex count (increase of 0.5-3% in this study). We found that in general, peak storm tide elevations along the open coast are decreased and the timing of the peak occurs later with local coastal mesh refinement. When validated against observed high water marks measured near the coast, coastal mesh refinement only has a significant positive impact on errors in narrow straits and inlets, and in bays and lakes separated from the ocean by these passages. The new ADCIRC v55 code capable of accurate global storm tide modeling with fine coastal resolution is computationally efficient. For global meshes with minimum resolution as fine as 1.5 km, the computational wallclock time ranged from 5 s to 30 s per simulation day on 480 computational processors for astronomical tide simulations. Some improvements that we made to the numerical stability of the algorithm facilitated the application of relatively large 120 s time steps to achieve this efficiency. However, we found that the locally refined meshes often required smaller time steps (25 s-90 s). Nevertheless, these are still much larger than time steps used in previous studies with older versions of ADCIRC, resulting in one-to-two orders of magnitude shorter computational times.
