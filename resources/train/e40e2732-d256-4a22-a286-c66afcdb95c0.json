[{"section_title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "A. Shish Area", "text": "The Chandeleur Islands are located south-southeast of St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana (Fig. 1). They began as a long island that has since been segmented into several islets covering 80 km. The Chandeleurs were formed over 2,000 years ago and are uninhabited [1]. Dozens of hurricanes and other severe storms have fragmented these islands, resulting in severe erosion of the island chain's land mass over time. The islands serve as a migratory stop for birds, provide habitat for nesting bird species, and are part of the second oldest National GVildlife Refuge in the United States. The Chandeleur Islands are a diverse landscape, composed of beaches, dunes, and marshes. The northern portion of the islands is dominated by beaches that have multiple bars and washover fans that are separated by dune fields. The dunes are vegetated by grasses and shrubs that grade into a high salt marsh, also populated by black mangroves. The southern portion of the islands is more narrow and lower in elevation than the northern portion, leading to shoals separated by tidal inlets and small island fragments. To the west over the St. Bernard Delta surface, the Chandeleur Islands are rapidly transgressing. The long-term Gulf shoreline erosion rates estimate a minimum 2 m/yr loss in the north-central portion and greater than 12 m/yr loss at the northern and southern ends of the islands [2]. The deterioration of the islands is caused not only by the frequency of Gulf storms but also by the subsidence of the St. Bernard Delta sediments and Fig. I study area. absence of a rejuvenating sediment supply. There have also been sea floor landslides, which may have caused stronger waves and greater erosional impact to the Chandeleur Islands as well. [3]. Over the past decade, tropical cyclones have decimated the Chandeleur Islands, destroying pre-existin g vegetation, ruining habitats, and eroding the shoreline. In 2004, when Hurricane Ivan passed approximately 95 kilometers east of the islands, it destroyed the restoration progress of the Chandeleur Islands. Almost all of the vegetation on the islands was lost and the washover charnels increased in number from 20 to over 100. The 2005 hurricane season further delayed any rebuilding progress that could have been made in the islands. Hurricanes Dennis, Katrina, Cindy, and Rita all occurred during the 2005 hurricane season, resulting in severe damage to the islands. In particular. Hurricanes Dennis and Katrina reduced and redistributed many terrestrial parts of the islands into sub-surface formations and shoals. Katrina also caused a severe amount of overwash, and consequently all of the planting sites created during previous restoration efforts became open water [3]. The 2008 hurricane season marked another disastrous year of hurricane impacts for the Chandeleur Islands, since they had not recovered from Hurricane Katrina by the time Tropical Storm Edouard passed the islands in August. Immediately following Edouard, two major hurricanes, Ike and Gustav, passed or made landfall near the Chandeleurs, further counteractin g the small amount of restoration progress in terms of land accretion that had been made prior to Katrina."}, {"section_title": "B. Relevance to National Concerns", "text": "This project pertains to two of NASA's Applied Sciences' applications of national priority: natural disasters and ecological forecasting. Natural disaster applications regard the assessment and prediction of natural disaster impacts and risks to help minimize impact and aid in resource and response planning. Hurricanes are a major threat and source of damage to the Gulf Coast, making it necessary for decision makers to be equipped with accurate and timely data that not only aid in response but also help to minimize losses. The purpose of this project is to assess the impact of tropical cyclonic events on the Chandeleur Islands and provide the potential to aid resource managers in restoration projects that can benefit the islands. The aim of ecological forecasting is to provide decision makers with reliable forecasts of living systems changes and estimations across time through the combination of satellite data, in situ data, and forecasting models [4]. The Pontchartrain Institute for Environmental Sciences (PIES) has not been able to quantify the transgression of the islands or assess impacts of recent hurricanes including Gustav in 2008 because of limited resources. Therefore; this project examined a method for effectively utilizing data acquired from NASA Earth Observing Systems (EOS) to evaluate and analyze the state of the Chandeleur Islands to support the assessment needs of the PIES."}, {"section_title": "II.

Data Utilized", "text": "For analysis of island land area change; vegetated area change, and island transgression, Earth observation and ancillary data were acquired from the following sources: \u2022 "}, {"section_title": "B. Image Processing", "text": "Unsupervised ISODATA (Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis Technique Algorithm) classifications were conducted on Landsat and ASTER datasets using ERDAS IMAGINE' on each of the subset ima ges using 150 classes, 150 iterations, and a convergence threshold of .995. The classified ima ges were then manually aggregated into two classes: water and land. The land and water classifications used to determine land area and calculations are found in Figs. 3 and 4. Pixels classified as water were used to create a mask covering the water surrounding the islands for each date to help ensure that Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) calculations (as described in Section C) did not include surrounding water areas [5]. MODIS images were processed using the Time Series Product Tool (TSPT), a program created at John C. Stennis Space Center for use in the \"automated, rapid, large-scale regional surveillance\" of vegetation; free of any atmospheric effects. TSPT, designed for use in MATLAB, provides a means to process MODIS data and other satellite sensor products by automatically correcting for cloud cover and by removing undesirable pixels [6]. It uses a number of modules to create images that are cloud and noise free. The output of the TSPT includes single image displays of satellite imagery, time-series plots for specific locations, or videos that show single images over a specified time frame [6] [7]. For this project, TSPT was set to apply MODIS data from the Terra and Aqua platforms. Images collected daily from 2000 to 2008 were used. MOD 09 GQ and GA were used to aid in tracking the transgression of the Chandeleur Islands over an 8-year period."}, {"section_title": "C. AD T17", "text": "NDVI is used to measure vegetation health. This project calculated NDVI to assess vegetated area cover change (as described below) and did not include surrounding water areas vegetation coverage of the islands. Landsat and ASTER data calculations were processed in ERDAS IMAGINE spatial modeler. During image analysis, values ranging from 0.0 to 0.02 were classified as sand. In calculating vegetated areas, since most of the vegetation on the Chandeleur Islands is sparse grass and shrubs, pixels with NDVI values greater than 0.02 were assessed as vegetation. Measurements of vegetation in hectares were computed in ERDAS IMAGINE for each image. Vegetated area quantification results are found in Figs. 5 and 6."}, {"section_title": "D.

Accuracy Assessment of Classifications", "text": "Accuracy assessments evaluate the quality of information derived from a particular dataset and are an essential part of the research to determine how classification methods affect results. Accuracy assessments in remote sensing are performed by selecting a number of points in the classified image and checking them against reference data; such as field survey results or high resolution imagery (usually less than 2 m) of the region [8]. Mien adequate ground reference data or aerial photography are not available, visual interpretation of the original data by a skilled individual familiar with the land cover types and ground conditions may be the only reasonable option to conduct the necessary accuracy assessments [9]. For this study, thematic map accuracy assessment was based upon visual interpretation of Landsat MSS and TM data as ground reference data [10]. The binomial probability theory equation was used to determine the number of points that should be selected for the accuracy assessment [8]. The equation (1) states where N is the sample size, Z = 2 from the standard deviate of 1.96 for the 95% two-sided confidence level, p is the expected accuracy for the entire map, q = 100 -p, and E is the allowable error [8]. Two hundred four points were randomly placed in each of the classified iniages. The Equalized Random point selection method was used to distribute the points to ensure that each class received the same number of points. Each land cover type had 102 points that had to be checked against the reference dataset. Each point on the classified image was checked against the reference dataset. Once the process was complete, the accuracy statistics were computed for each land cover type and for the image collectively. Results from the accuracy assessment are found in Tables 2-4."}, {"section_title": "G.

Land and Vegetation Change", "text": "In 1979, the total area of the Chandeleur Islands was assessed at 2588.4 hectares (Fig. 3). In 2009, the total area of the islands was 1663.29 hectares (Fig. 4). This equates to a 35-7% loss of land area over the entire 30-year study period, with 16.0% lost between 1979 and 1998 and 19.7% lost between 1998 and 2009- In 1979, the total vegetated area of the Chandeleur Islands was assessed to be 412.92 hectares (Fig. 5). In 2009, the total vegetated area of the islands was assessed to be 218.43 hectares (Fig. 6). This equated to a 47.1% loss over the entire 30-year study period; with 89.7% gained from 1979 and 1998 and 136.8% lost from 1998 to 2009- The graphs for both land area and vegetation change were broken into time periods of 1979 to 1998 (pre-Hurricane Georges) and 1998 to 2009 (post-Hurricane Georges). The 1998 hurricane season marked the beginning of a period of both increased storm frequency and severe degradation to the Chandeleur Islands. The trend lines shown in both graphs of land area and vegetation area support this finding and help to further illustrate this dramatic trend change."}, {"section_title": "B. Transgression", "text": "Figs. 8-11 show that the northern and muddle portions of the islands remained mostly stationary throughout the MODIS study period, except for the time period directly following Hurricane Katrina in 2005-After Hurricane Katrina, the northern and middle portions of the island exhibited a slight transgressive movement. However, Figs. 12 and 13 show that the southern portion of the islands steadily transgressed from 2000 to 2008: however, the transgression was accelerated by Hurricane Katrina in 2005."}, {"section_title": "C. Tides", "text": "Tides are an important factor to consider in the study of barrier islands. Tides control the water level and the movement of water around barrier islands and through tidal inlets. Because of the bathometry and the shallow slope of the Chandeleur Islands, the tidal elevations at the islands are greatly influenced by wind. This process, called wind setup, can cause actual tides to be higher or lower than forecasted tides [I I ]. The ability to accurately measure tides on the Chandeleur Islands is limited. There are no tidal gauges on the Islands, and the closest buoy is located about 9 miles NNE of the islands. The recorded tides at this buoy are not an accurate representation of the actual tides at the Chandeleur Islands. The buoy is located in open water and is not affected by the same near-shore bathometry as the islands. Estimated tidal ranges were acquired through the use of the Tides extension to NOAA's Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH) model. The SLOSH Model provides historical predictions of tidal range by hour. The imagery metadata was examined and the nearest hour was used to determine tides, e.g., for an image acquired at 10:25 AM, the 10:00 AM tide was used. The predicted tidal range, as referenced to mean water level (cowl), was obtained for each hour at the time of sensor "}, {"section_title": "D. Winds", "text": "Winds affect the erosion of the Chandeleur Islands because seasonal wind patterns greatly influence the wave climate along the Louisiana coast. The direction and speed of the winds can determine the erosive energy of the waves. There is a high correlation between wind direction and direction of dominant wave approach [11]. Southeasterly winds produce waves with the greatest fetch because they can travel the farthest distance. Therefore, waves approaching from the southeast are often the most erosive. The wind profile reflects weather patterns. Fig. 14 shows that during the summer season, the wind is predominately from the south. Fig. 15 shows that during the winter season, the wind is predommately from the northeast. During the winter, because of cold front passage, the wind often comes from a north-north-,vesterly direction.. This is significant because northwest winds cause waves that erode the back barrier beaches, which are more stable and usually sheltered from erosive forces. Therefore, the Chandeleur Islands are constantly susceptible to wind-driven erosion throughout the year."}, {"section_title": "V. CONCLUSION", "text": "Over the past several centuries, the Chandeleur Islands have been slowly erodin g and movin g toward the mainland. As transgressive barrier islands, this is their natural morphology. However this project found that beginning around 1998, vegetated area and land area began dramatically decreasing. An increase in frequency and intensity of storms over the past decade has hindered regeneration of the islands and has made them more susceptible to damage from natural phenomena, such as cold fronts, winds, and waves. Hurricane events, such as Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and Hurricane Gustav in 2008, have accelerated the transgression of the island. The northern and middle portions of the island remained mostly stationary throughout 2000-2008, except directly following Hurricane Katrina in 2005-The southern portion of the islands steadily transgressed landward throughout the entire period, but transgression was accelerated by Hurricane Katrina's impact in 2005. TSPT was instrumental in providing analysis and quantifying transgression of the islands. Without restoration efforts, coastal Louisiana will likely lose its first line of defense from future tropical cyclonic events. Overall, this project benefits the Pontchartrain Institute for Environmental Sciences by providing use of NASA Earth Observation Systems in necessary barrier island research."}]
