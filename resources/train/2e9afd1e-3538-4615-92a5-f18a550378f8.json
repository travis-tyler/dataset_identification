Recent upgrades to the numerical model, including the incorporation of astronomical tides, are described and simulations with and without these upgrades are contrasted to assess their contributions to the increase in forecast accuracy. It is shown, through comprehensive verifications of SLOSH simulation results against peak water surface elevations measured at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) tide gauge stations, by storm surge sensors deployed and hundreds of high water marks collected by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), that the SLOSH-simulated water levels at 71% (89%) of the data measurement locations have less than 20% (30%) relative error. The RMS error between observed and modeled peak water levels is 0.47 m. In addition, the model's extreme computational efficiency enables it to OPEN ACCESS J. Mar. Sci.

Note the interaction of the hurricane with the approaching winter storm, the subsequent drop in mean sea level pressure to 940 mb, and the development of cold and warm fronts during the hybridization process off the coast of New Jersey.\nOne of the most dangerous aspects of Hurricane Sandy was its large size, approximately 1150 miles (1850 km) in diameter, based on the extent of the last closed isobar, with a wind field that created a significant storm tide threat to vast areas along the Atlantic coastline and inland. Hurricane Sandy retained its large wind field, large radius of maximum winds, and hybrid characteristics through landfall [2] . After Hurricane Sandy made landfall in NJ, its sustained winds increased as an effect of the winter storm approaching from the west. The combination of both Hurricane Sandy and the winter storm, timed with the full-moon high tide on the night of 29 October, worsened the storm-tide flooding along the NJ, NY and CT coastlines and caused significant flooding far inland along the Delaware and Hudson Rivers [3] . Hurricane Sandy caused 147 direct deaths (286 total) and damage of $68 billion dollars. It is the second-costliest Atlantic hurricane on record.\nThe storm surge above astronomical tide produced by Hurricane Sandy reached its highest observed levels of 3.86 m (12. According to a recent National Hurricane Center (NHC) technical memorandum [4] , inundation is defined as the total water level that occurs on normally dry ground as a result of the storm tide. It is expressed in terms of height of water, in feet, above ground level (AGL). NHC's official forecasts provide storm surge-induced flooding information in terms of inundation (feet of water above ground level). The tidal datum MHHW (Mean Higher High Water) is considered the best possible approximation of the threshold at which inundation can begin to occur since at the coast, areas higher than MHHW are typically dry most of the time.\nThe highest recorded total water levels, which occurred within half an hour of high tide in the Staten Island and Manhattan areas, reached a record 4.28 m (14.06 ft) above Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW), 2.74 m (8.99 ft) above MHHW at The Battery, NY; a record 4.36 m (14.31 ft) above MLLW, 1.98 m (6.51 ft) above MHHW at King's Point, and 4.44 m (14.58 ft) above MLLW, 2.76 m (9.06 ft) above MHHW at Bergen Point West Reach. At The Battery, the storm tide (the combination of storm surge and astronomical tide [4] ) crested 1.39 m (4.55 ft) higher than the water that occurred during Hurricane Irene (2011) [2] . Storm tide records were broken in Sandy Hook, NJ with 4.03 m (13.23 ft) MLLW, 2.44 m (8.01 ft) MHHW and at Philadelphia, PA with 3.24 m (10.62 ft) MLLW, 1.2 m (3.93 ft) MHHW 8 h after landfall. The tide gauge at Sandy Hook failed before the peak water levels were reached. Table 1 summarizes the maximum total, tide (referenced to various vertical datums) and surge water levels reached at three NOAA stations at the coast: The Battery, Bergen Point and Kings Point. At The Battery total water levels crested at the same time as the surge, even though the highest tides arrived half an hour earlier. At Bergen Point the maximum surge arrived half an hour after the highest total water level, while at Kings Point the maximum surge arrived two hours before the highest total water level.\nA buoy at the entrance of New York Harbor (Station 44065), 15 nm southeast of Breezy Point, NY, measured a record significant wave height (SWH, the highest one-third of all wave heights measured during a 20-min sampling period) of 9.86 m (32.5 ft) at 00:50 UTC on 30 October and an atmospheric pressure of 958 hPa, while buoys in Central (44039) and Western (44040) Long Island Sound recorded SWHs of 2.2 m and 2.1 m, respectively. Buoy (44009) at Delaware Bay, 48 km (26 nm) SE of Cape May, NJ, USA, reached a SWH of 7.38 m. At more than 300 km (190 miles) away from the point of landfall at Block Island, RI (44097), SWHs reached 9.48 m. Even as far away as 450 km (280 miles) at Buoy 44008, located 54 nm SE of Nantucket Shoals, a SWH of 10.97 m was registered. Table 1 . Maximum total, tide (referenced to various vertical datums) and surge water levels reached at three NOAA tide gauge stations at the coast: The Battery, Bergen Point and Kings Point, NY (see Figure 2 for station locations). The Battery, NY These various measurements depict the difficulty in assessing the storm surge threat because water level values might be referenced to different vertical datums or the quoted water surface elevations might represent only partial components of the total water level (e.g., tide or surge). It is easy to see how the public could become confused by this plethora of information and why it is crucial to communicate the storm surge threat clearly to the public to minimize the loss of life. Therefore, in addition to producing operational storm surge forecasts and issuing public advisories, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) has worked extensively with social scientists to craft graphics and text that convey the potential dangers of storm surge effectively [6] ."}, {"section_title": "Station (ID)", "text": "Operational storm surge forecasts during the storm and post-storm hindcast simulations of Hurricane Sandy were run by forecasters in NHC's Storm Surge Unit using the NWS Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH) model. This manuscript describes the operational forecasts of Hurricane Sandy run in the SLOSH ny3 basin (Figure 3) , the improvements to the surge forecasting system implemented during 2013, and how the storm would have been predicted had the enhanced system been available in 2012.\nHindcast simulations of Hurricane Sandy were run for analysis and verification. Comparisons of observed water levels at NOAA tide gauge stations, by USGS temporary storm surge sensors (SSS) and high water marks (HWM) were compared with the numerically simulated water levels to assess model performance. "}, {"section_title": "Model", "text": "SLOSH [1] is a numerical coastal ocean model used by the National Weather Service to run: (1) real-time operational; (2) hypothetical (for evacuation planning); (3) historical (for validation purposes); (4) probabilistic [7] ; and (5) extratropical storm surge prediction simulations.\nIt is an extremely computationally efficient, 2-D explicit, finite-difference model, formulated on a semi-staggered Arakawa B-grid [8] . The horizontal transport equations are solved through the application of the Navier-Stokes momentum equations for incompressible and turbulent flow. The SLOSH model transport equations were derived by Platzman [9] , in which the dissipation is determined solely by an eddy viscosity coefficient. A bottom slip coefficient was included by Jelesnianski [10] . The governing equations are integrated over the entire depth of the water column. At every time step, the horizontal transports are solved from the pressure, Coriolis and frictional forces. These transports generate an updated level of surge at every model grid point. SLOSH includes a wetting-and-drying algorithm to predict inland inundation.\nA simplified parametric wind model is embedded in the SLOSH model. The input parameters of the wind model consist of the storm track (latitude and longitude of the center's location), radius of maximum winds and the difference between the environmental and the central pressures (pressure drop) of the storm. The wind-driven forcing is incorporated into SLOSH as wind stress.\nSLOSH grids have different shapes (hyperbolic, elliptical or polar) that can be customized for specific coastline geometries, with higher resolution near the coast and grid cells that telescope outward concentrically to lower resolution offshore. There are 37 operational SLOSH basins that cover the east coast of the US, the Gulf of Mexico, the Bahamas, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. The bathymetry and topography in the model grid cells are derived from National Elevation Dataset (NED) digital elevation models (DEMs) from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the NOAA National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) Tsunami inundation DEMs, and Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) data from the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) or from state and local sources, if available, and the bathymetry from NGDC 3 arc-second Coastal Relief Model. All the bathymetric/topographic data must be referenced to a single vertical datum and averaged to obtain the depth/elevation of each individual SLOSH cell. The land cover classifications are derived from the USGS 30 m spatial resolution National Land Cover Database (NLCD). SLOSH basins include subgrid-scale features that allow simulation of the flow through barriers, gaps, passes, overtopping of barriers, roads, and levees.\nAn automated, event-triggered, storm surge prediction system, AutoSurge [11] , was developed at NHC in 2010 to accelerate forecaster workflows by eliminating labor-intensive tasks, computing storm parameters with greater accuracy and preventing human input error. The system runs the SLOSH model; the input is determined objectively and consistently for all operational simulations. AutoSurge automatically generates a vast array of products from the SLOSH model output to provide internal guidance to the Storm Surge Specialists."}, {"section_title": "Forecasts", "text": "As soon as a tropical disturbance with the potential of developing into a tropical cyclone in the subsequent 48-h is identified in the Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea, or the Gulf of Mexico, AutoSurge begins generating storm surge forecast simulations using the SLOSH model. The system alerts the Storm Surge Specialists at NHC, sending guidance products via e-mail, and the results are available on an internal web site, both in tabular and graphical format. Forecasts are run using storm track information that includes the latitude and longitude of the storm's center, intensity (maximum sustained 1-min wind speed), pressure drop and radius of maximum winds from NHC's Best Track operational data and parameters from all of the model information available to the Hurricane Specialists at NHC. The SLOSH parametric wind model is used to ensure that the parameters in the SLOSH wind formulation are consistent with those in the model guidance, i.e., the resulting wind speed in the SLOSH wind model is in accordance to the NHC's Best Track and the model guidance intensity, in a manner similar to other storm surge forecast systems [12, 13] .\nGraphics of the ensemble maximum envelope of water, model track spread, individual ensemble member maximum water levels, wind intensity, the radius of maximum winds, and forecast trends are generated to depict the expected range of the storm surge forecasts to account for variability in the atmospheric forcing.\nAutoSurge was run in surge-only mode during the 2012 hurricane season. More than 1000 AutoSurge numerical simulations were run during Hurricane Sandy using the Best Track and the internal NHC model guidance used to create the official track (OFCL Results for the ny3 basin will be described and the model output graphics will be shown in this manuscript. These ensemble simulations are run in conjunction with the probabilistic P-Surge modeling system [7] developed at NOAA/Meteorological Development Laboratory (MDL), which runs an ensemble of storm surge simulations using historical error statistics of the wind parameters to generate the forecast tracks.\nEnhancements made to AutoSurge in 2013 include:\n( The new version of SLOSH + Tides (V. 2) incorporates the tides dynamically at every time step and at every SLOSH model grid point [14] . The location-dependent amplitudes and phases of 37 tidal constituents (selected to be consistent with NOAA/NOS station data) at all locations in the SLOSH grid [15] used are: M2, S2, N2, K1, M4, O1, M6, MK3, S4, MN4, NU2, S6, MU2, 2N2, OO1, LAM2, S1, M1, J1, MM, SSA, SA, MSF, MF, RHO, Q1, T2, R2, 2Q1, P1, 2SM2, M3, L2, 2MK3, K2, M8, MS4 (for definitions of the harmonic constituents see Table 2 and the glossary at [16] ).\nThe harmonic constituents used in the SLOSH + Tides code had recently been extracted from the new, updated experimental EC2013 ADCIRC tidal database. This database employs high-resolution NOAA VDatum meshes (coastal resolution down to 14 m) along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts of the United States, Puerto Rico and US Virgin Islands, an updated offshore bathymetry using the latest global sources, namely, Space Shuttle Radar Topography Mission SRTM30_PLUS V8.0 from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and ETOPO1 global relief model from NOAA [17] and open boundary forcing with the latest global tidal models (TPXO 7.2 OSU Tidal Inversion Software, and later on from the FES 2004 Global Tidal Atlas and the newly released FES2012 model) [18] . AutoSurge incorporated V. 2 of SLOSH + Tides in the forecast system workflow for the 2013 hurricane season. AutoSurge used V. 2.1 of SLOSH + Tides for the ny3 basin, which has a tide-forcing threshold (bathymetric depth of influence) from the deep ocean up to a specified depth. Testing and analysis of various threshold depths for the ny3 basin determined that the optimum setting was 100 ft (30.48 m).\nDue to the limited amount of time available to complete the numerical forecasts, the model runtime has to be short to be able to construct the storm surge prediction ensembles. The runtime performance for a typical SLOSH model simulation run over the ny3 basin on a typical desktop PC or Linux workstation is shown in Table 3 . In the past two years, directed by research, testing and recommendations from social scientists [6] , NHC's public advisories were modified to include values of inundation above ground level at the peak of high tide so the public would better understand the storm surge threat. An example, Public Advisory 26A, issued for 8:00 PM EDT (00:00 UTC) Sunday 28 October 2012, one day before Hurricane Sandy made landfall in New Jersey, is shown in Figure 4 . Note that the water levels are referenced -above ground\u2016 and are considered valid only if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide.

Figure 5 shows an example of the model tracks used by NHC's Hurricane Specialists as guidance to determine the OFCL track for Hurricane Sandy 48-hours prior to landfall. It depicts a large spread in the model tracks with various intensities, sizes and storm center locations. This guidance is used to run the ensemble SLOSH simulations. Figure 6 displays the ensemble maximum envelope of water 48-hours prior to landfall with a maximum total water level of 4.94 m (16.2 ft) NAVD88. A summary plot of the ensemble results for the simulations, valid 48 h prior to landfall, is shown in Figure 7 . Figure 5 . Example of the model tracks used by the Hurricane Specialists at NHC to develop the OFCL forecast track for Hurricane Sandy.

This meteorological guidance is used as forcing to run the SLOSH ensemble storm surge simulations. The label inside the white box at the end of each track indicates the ensemble member number that corresponds to the number in the horizontal axis in Figure 7 . The bottom (blue) panel provides the maximum predicted water levels relative to both NAVD88 (dark blue dots) and AGL (black triangles) for each ensemble member. The solid (dashed) red lines show the maximum water levels in NAVD88 (AGL) and the solid (dashed) purple lines show the average water levels in NAVD88 (AGL) for each ensemble member. The storm surge threat 48 h prior to the storm was 4.94 m (16.2 ft) relative to the NAVD88 datum, a maximum inundation of 4.30 m (14.1 ft, AGL). The NHC OFCL track (last ensemble member) produced a 3 m (10.0 ft) surge (2.3 m (7.6 ft) of inundation), about 1 m higher than the average of all the ensemble members but lower than the ensemble maximum. The middle (yellow) panel shows the maximum wind speeds (red dots) and wind speeds at the closest point of approach (CPA, blue dots) of each model guidance ensemble member.\nThe maximum wind speed of 51 ms \u22121 (100 kt) shows in all the models, which occurred when Sandy made landfall in Cuba on October 25. The winds at the closest point of approach (prior to or at landfall) vary from 8 to 37 ms \u22121 (17 to 72 kts), which indicates the uncertainty in the wind forcing and, therefore, the variability in the storm surge potential. The top (purple) panel indicates the radius of maximum winds at CPA for each model/aid ensemble, which varies from 8 to 218 km (5 to 136 miles, 4 to 118 nm). This also contributes to the unpredictability of the storm surge hazard, even 48 h prior to actual landfall. As the storm evolves in time, the AutoSurge forecast system calculates the trend of maximum water elevation above NAVD88 and the water height above ground level for all the ensemble members at each synoptic time, as shown in Figure 8a ,b. The yellow box depicts the range of water levels issued by NHC in the forecast advisories. The maximum water elevation levels predicted converge to 3.8 m (12.4 ft) relative to the NAVD88 vertical datum or 2.9 m (9.5 ft) of inundation (AGL).

In the case of the surge-plus-tides simulations, the water levels AGL are lower since the cells (areas) that would be wetted by the tides alone at any time during the model simulation are not considered inundated in the results.

Preliminary experiments, in which the boundary condition in the SLOSH grid was modified from deep to shallow water (since it is so close to the coast) at that model boundary, seem to improve the results for this station. It is anticipated that this adjustment will be included when a new higher-resolution SLOSH New York grid is built. The highest resolution in the current ny3 basin is 213 m. Considering only those stations away from the basin boundary, the correlations between the model-simulated and measured water surface elevations range from 0.83 to 0.94 for the surge-only, and 0.81 to 0.95 for the surge-plus-tides simulations.

This was the second-largest deployment of storm-tide sensors, exceeded only by the number distributed during Hurricane Irene (2011), which made landfall in the same area of the US [3] . 145 water level and 9 wave-height sensors were deployed at 147 locations while 8 rapid deployment gauges (RDGs), and 62 barometric pressure sensors were deployed at additional locations. The water level sensors recorded water levels at 30-second intervals, the wave sensors recorded data every 2 s, the RDG sensors recorded water levels and meteorological data every 15 min and the barometric pressure sensors recorded at 30-second intervals. The water levels were recorded in feet above NAVD88. Unfortunately, 7 water level sensors were lost or the structures to which they were attached were damaged, 4 water level sensors and 1 wave sensor did not record (the water did not rise high enough to be measured) and 2 RDGs were destroyed by flood. This temporary monitoring network augmented the existing tide gauge networks and helped characterize the height, extent and timing of the storm tides. Table 5 shows the USGS storm surge sensors (SSS) deployed in each state that were used to compare water level measurements against results from the SLOSH surge-plus-tides simulation. Of the 154 sensors, only 81 were located in the ny3 basin. 9 sensors that recorded high-frequency wave heights could not be used for verification purposes because the coupled surge (SLOSH) plus wave (SWAN, Simulating WAves Nearshore) modeling system is still undergoing development and testing. 12 sensors were close to the SLOSH basin boundary or were sited in locations that were contaminated by local effects (some sensors were buried under the sand attached to an underground piling, others were surrounded by high marsh grass/weeds, some sensors were mounted on structures that block flow in most directions, other sensors were located in narrow alleys between buildings where extreme, unrepresentative channeling can occur, etc.). These sub-grid scale features and geomorphologies are not modeled or resolved by the SLOSH grid, so those sensors were not employed in the verification process.

The dark orange cone depicts the 10% error, the orange cone depicts 20% error and the yellow cone depicts 30% error. The water surface elevation errors at most stations are within the 10%-20% range. Table 11 summarizes the relative error of the HWM vs. SLOSH maximum water levels. Almost 90% have errors less than or equal to 30%. Of the remaining HWM locations where the relative error exceeds 30%, there were 17 locations where the SLOSH-simulated maximum water levels were greater than HWM and 13 locations where the SLOSH-simulated maximum water levels were less than HWM, so there is no clear error bias. Figure 16 shows the SLOSH-simulated surge-plus-tides maximum envelope of water (relative to NAVD88) for Hurricane Sandy. Observations at NOAA stations (squares), SSS (triangles) and HWM (circles) have been added with the same color range for comparison. For the most part, the observations are in good agreement with the model results. Some HWMs have higher water level values than those simulated (red circles), particularly in west Raritan Bay, NY. It seems the water in the East River is not flowing through the grid properly. There could be many reasons for this including: unsimulated features in the wind field, the formulations of the surface and bottom stresses, lack of coupling to a wave model, and/or sophistication of the boundary conditions; however of particular significance is a lack of resolution in that area and a non-optimal orientation angle of the grid lines with respect to the river. More detailed investigation needs to be conducted and a new New York basin might need to be built to remedy this retardation of the water flow. The distribution of the relative error between the observed and modeled maximum heights is shown in Figure 17 . Errors are less than 10% in the Long Island Sound, the CT and RI coastlines and 20% along the south shore of Long Island (Breezy Point, Atlantic Beach, Long Beach, Jones Beach the Hamptons). Some isolated areas along the east NJ coastline (Surf City) exhibit higher relative errors. Figure 17 .

The geographical patterns of inundation agree quite well, especially at Breezy Point, Rockaway, the low-lying areas surrounding JFK airport and further east along the shores of East Bay and South Oyster Bay. The SLOSH wetting-and-drying algorithm performs skillfully inland to the west, in the area extending from south to north along the west bank of the Hudson River from Hoboken to Union City, NJ and further west in the larger Jersey City, Secaucus and Ridgefield area. Flooding over the river banks is also accurately simulated to the south along the Raritan River, the Washington Canal and the South River. The inundation area calculated from the SLOSH Best Track hindcast simulation was 561 km 2 (216 sq mi). "}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "The verification analyses conducted in this study show that the NWS SLOSH storm surge prediction model is able to simulate the height, timing, evolution and extent of the water that was driven ashore by Hurricane Sandy (2012) with a high degree of fidelity. Upgrades to the numerical model in 2013, including the incorporation of astronomical tides with 37 harmonic constituents, have increased its hindcast accuracy and will enable forecasters to better predict the timing and extent of the total water level and inundation.\nIn addition, the model's extreme computational efficiency enables it to run large, automated ensembles of predictions in real-time to account for the high variability in atmospheric forcing that can occur in tropical cyclone forecasts, which makes the guidance designed to alert the public and prevent the loss of life more robust and reliable.\nQuantitative comparisons ( Figure 19 , summary provided in Table 12 ) of SLOSH simulation results against water surface peak elevations measured at all 13 NOAA tide gauge stations, by 60 storm surge sensors deployed by the USGS prior to the storm, and from 268 HWMs collected by USGS-a total of 341 observations-reveal that the SLOSH model-simulated water levels at more than one-third (34%) of the data measurement locations have less than 10% error (dark orange cone), while 71% (89%) have less than 20% (30%) error (orange and yellow cones, respectively). The RMS error between the observed and modeled peak water levels is 0.47 m (1.5 ft) ( Table 13 ). The arrival times of the peaks in the water elevation observations at NOAA and USGS SSS stations and their SLOSH-simulated counterparts are in good agreement, as demonstrated by the hydrographs and the statistical calculations (RMSE and correlation) from the time series.\nThe SLOSH simulations underestimated the surge in some areas far from the point of landfall and far from the center of the SLOSH grid where the resolution is coarser (CT, MA, RI) and in the Raritan Bay where the resolution (2 grid cells) across the East River might not be allowing the water to flow freely into the bay. Many other factors may have contributed to the underestimation of water levels in these locations: grid resolution, basin size, boundary conditions, lack of waves in the simulations, the tidal method, wind field, surface stress, bottom stress, etc. In this case, the most likely reason for the error is the coarseness of the grid. Previous SLOSH studies [21] have shown that larger and higher resolution SLOSH grids and different parameterizations of the surface and bottom stresses can improve the accuracy of the storm surge results. Efforts are currently underway to test and validate a coupled SLOSH + SWAN modeling system [21] that includes surge, tides and waves.\nThe highly complex structure of Hurricane Sandy presented an operational challenge for the standard tropical version of SLOSH. Figure 20 shows a comparison between the winds produced by the SLOSH parametric wind model and the real-time multi-platform satellite surface wind analysis at 00 UTC on 30 October 2012 from the NOAA National Environmental Satellite, Data and Information Service (NESDIS), the Cooperative Institute for Research in the Atmosphere (CIRA) Regional and Mesoscale Meteorology Branch (RAMMB) at Colorado State University (CSU) [22] as Hurricane Sandy made landfall northeast of Atlantic City, NJ. The wind analysis combines information from five different data sources to create a mid-level wind analysis, which is then adjusted to the surface using empirical, radially varying coefficients obtained from reconnaissance aircraft and GPS dropwindsonde data. Despite the simplicity of the SLOSH parametric wind model, the simulated winds are remarkably realistic. There is strong wavenumber 1 asymmetry due to the storm's forward motion. The 50 kt (25.72 ms \u22121 ) isotachs in panels (a) and (b) are similar in orientation, shape and extent. The SLOSH surface friction simulates a reduction in wind speed of about 10 knots (5.14 ms \u22121 ) over Long\nIsland Sound due to the downwind effects of the Long Island land cover. The wind directions in both panels also compare quite favorably. The basis of this study was to assess a baseline skill level of SLOSH and compare it to its latest improvements demonstrated by the inclusion of tidal constituents in SLOSH. Implementing gridded wind fields, an improved parametric wind model [12] , and a combination thereof are planned upgrades to SLOSH.\nThe ExtraTropical Storm Surge Model (ETSS), developed by the NOAA/NWS Meteorological Development Laboratory (MDL), is a variation of the NWS SLOSH that runs operationally on NCEP's central computing system four times daily. The model is forced by real-time output of winds and pressures from the NCEP Global Forecast System (GFS) and produces numerical storm surge guidance for extratropical systems in 6 grids that cover the US East Coast, Gulf of Mexico, West Coast, Gulf of Alaska, Bering Sea and Arctic. This modeling system does not currently include overland flooding or tides. Work is currently underway to combine the ETSS and the newer versions of SLOSH, which include tides and inundation, via nesting from the coarser ETSS grids down to the latest higher resolution SLOSH grids.\nAn improved version of the Mattocks and Forbes [12] asymmetric parametric wind model, GWAVA (Gradient Wind Asymmetric Vortex Algorithm), is currently being incorporated into SLOSH. Blending the near-field winds from this more advanced parametric wind model with gridded far-field winds from the GFS or other numerical weather prediction models will potentially improve storm surge prediction by providing more realistic multi-scale wind forcing at the ocean surface and its hydrodynamic response.\nThe value of future upgrades to the SLOSH model and basin refinements can later be compared to this baseline study. This analysis will also be instrumental in the evaluation of other modeling systems and to assess how they might contribute to operational forecasting as NHC moves toward a multi-model ensemble."}, {"section_title": "Author Contributions", "text": "Cristina Forbes developed AutoSurge, ran the operational forecast and hindcast simulations, generated graphics and did the analysis and validation of observations vs. SLOSH results; Jamie Rhome provided his expertise in operational storm surge forecasting and communication of the storm surge threat; Craig Mattocks contributed his knowledge on the atmospheric forcing of storm surge simulations, forecast ensembles, parametric wind models, optimization of numerical models and visualization of the results; Arthur Taylor provided his expertise on the SLOSH model and implementation of the various upgrades used in the operational and hindcast simulations."}]
