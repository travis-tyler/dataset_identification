[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "An extensive recent literature has documented a strong and persistent impact of initial labor market conditions on individuals' earnings. 1 Many of the studies have identified a change in first jobs or occupations as the main cause for this effect. For example, graduating MBAs are less likely to get a job in investment banking if there is a shock to financial markets (Oyer 2008). Since starting on Wall Street upon graduation makes a person more likely to work there later, temporary shocks can have large impacts on MBAs' lifetime earnings. The effects on initial jobs are not limited to the very top of the earnings distribution: for example Oreopoulos, von Wachter, and Heisz (2012) find that college graduates entering the labor market during recessions take up jobs with lower paying employers and then gradually-but not fully-recover by switching to higher paying employers over time. 2 Despite showing that temporary shocks change workers' initial jobs and in principle recognizing that this \"can lead to persistent changes in the allocation of workers\" (Oreopoulos, von Wachter, and Heisz 2012), none of these studies has analysed the aggregate implications of such a reallocation. More concretely, because of the above findings, the business cycle can affect the size and the composition of the workforce and thus have long-term effects on sectoral productivity and output. This is particularly important if sectors benefiting from an inflow of talent during recessions have a higher (or lower) social value than the sectors where the talent is drawn from. For example, if in a recession talented individuals choose to work in entrepreneurship or research instead of rent-seeking sectors, this may have some social benefits that subtract from the immense adverse effects of downturns. And, even if this is not the case, the observation that hiring in a downturn is a cost-effective way to attract and retain talent may be a compelling rationale for an anti-cyclical recruitment policy for businesses and the public sector alike. 1 See, for example, Oreopoulos, von Wachter, and Heisz (2012), Devereux (2002a), Raaum and R\u00f8ed (2006), Sullivan and von Wachter (2009), Kahn (2010), Genda, Kondo, and Ohta (2010), Oyer (2006), Oyer (2008). 2 Other studies have shown that enrolment rates rise during recessions (e.g. Gustman andSteinmeier 1981, Black andSufi 2002). This suggests that at least part of the effect on initial occupations is a deliberate choice by the affected individuals. This is the first study to explore the impact of the business cycle on long-term productivity and output across sectors via the allocation of talent. To do this, we focus on the productivity of new hires over the business cycle in an occupation where output is well measurable. We proceed in two steps: first, we develop a Roy-style model of occupational choice that speaks to our empirical setting below. Yet it makes two general points, informing us about the expected composition of talent if all individuals can freely choose their occupation and if only a certain number of jobs are available. In the first case workers are allocated according to relative advantage, while in the second case individuals must have an absolute advantage to be able to enter the restricted sector. Second, we collect data from an empirical setting that is well suited for our study of the reallocation of talent and sectoral productivity: the career choices and publication records of economics PhDs who graduated from the top 30 US universities. We are examining this particular occupation because academic publication records provide us with a direct measure of productivity that does not suffer from two fundamental flaws: endogeneity to the business cycle and imprecision. First, wages or firm output are not only affected by the productivity of workers but also by product market demand, which falls in recession. Therefore it is hard to learn from such measures about a change in worker productivity caused by recessions. Second, since a firm's production is normally the result of a collaborative effort of many individuals, it is difficult to infer from a change in output the value of a specific worker's or cohort\u00e2\u0102\u0179s contribution. Contrary to that, academic publications can be attributed to particular individuals, we can quite well assess their quality, and journals' demand for articles does not vary over the business cycle. 3 In addition, the education of PhD economists provides two different and well-defined career decision points, the application to and the graduation from graduate school, which conform relatively well to the absolute and the comparative advantage cases mentioned above. For our empirical analysis we construct a new dataset of economists' career choices and publication output from publicly available sources. The dataset consists of graduation years and the degree granting universities of 13,624 PhDs since 195513,624 PhDs since to 1994 from the top 30 American institutions. We match each person with all their publications in JStor during the first ten years after graduation and with an indicator for becoming a faculty member or a member of the American Economic Association (AEA) after the PhD. Thus, we can calculate the propensity to stay in academia and the long-term publication output for each economist. Finally, we aggregate each cohort according to university and graduation year, and match different business cycle indicators (recession dummies, GDP growth, and unemployment rates and their changes) at time of application to and at time of graduation from a PhD program. We quantify the influence of the business cycle indicators at both points in time on economists' propensity to decide in favor of academic employment and on their productivity. Our empirical results support the predictions of the Roy Model and the more general idea that the business cycle influences sectoral productivity and output via a reallocation of talent. The model predicts that a recession during the application period makes entry into graduate school more competitive, because application rates rise and the number of available spaces is more or less fixed. Consequently, the ability of admitted PhD students should increase during recessions. Indeed, in our data, cohorts who entered during a recession publish more on average, i.e. are more productive, than boom cohorts. The model also predicts that at graduation from the PhD, when top-jobs in academia are hard to get but there is potentially some flexibility in the number of lower-ranked academic jobs, the number and / or the quality of individuals staying in academia rises during recessions. In our data, we find that individuals who graduated during a recession are more likely to become academics and those who do, publish more on average. Overall output in the academic sector thus rises. Finally, the model predicts that individuals who entered a PhD program during recession are less likely to stay in academia after graduation. The reason is that some of them have relatively strong non-academic skills and find it profitable to leave academia after the economy recovered. We also find empirical evidence in support of this idea. We quantify the long-term effects of the business cycle on productivity and output because our measure takes into account all publications authored in the first ten years after graduation. The effects accumulate during this time span indicating a persistent difference between boom and recession cohorts. Moreover, they are of economically substantial magnitude: we expect assistant professors from a cohort who applied to the PhD during a typical recession (a rise in unemployment rates by 2.5 percentage points) to be 17 percent more productive than assistant professors who applied in an average year (0 percentage points unemployment change). Furthermore, three percent more PhD graduates stay in academia in a typical recession and they produce on average 14 percent more publications than economists graduating in an average year. Our results are robust over a wide variety of alternative measures of output and occupational choice as well as in different subsamples. For example, the change in productivity is most pronounced for the graduates of the top Tier 1 universities, but also holds over the entire skill distribution. Unemployment change is our preferred measure of the business cycle, but NBER recession indicators or GDP Growth as explanatory variables deliver similar results. The number of publications in the top 5 journals as a measure of productivity works almost as well as impact weightedpublications. It does not matter qualitatively if we use listing in a faculty database, the propensity to publish, or membership in the American Economic Association as indicator for being a member of the academic sector. This paper informs at least three ongoing debates. Foremost, in the literature on long-term effects of recessions, it identifies and demonstrates the quantitative importance of a hitherto ignored implication of its findings-that recessions change the composition of talent across sectors and thus their long-term productivity and output. Prior literature recognized that initial jobs shape long-term careers of individuals and that they differ for recession and boom cohorts (e.g. Oreopoulos, von Wachter, and Heisz 2012, Devereux 2002a, Kahn 2010, Oyer 2006, Oyer 2008). 4 Furthermore, it documents that less advantaged workers seem to be most affected (in particular Oreopoulos, von Wachter, and Heisz 2012), although Oyer (2008) also finds large effects for MBAs. Our study adds to these findings that the recession-induced reallocation of workers changes the long-term productivity and output of a sector and that theses effects are quantitatively important for the top of the skill distribution. A concurrent paper corroborates our results by showing that MIT students who graduate during recessions are producing more patents over the long term and that this is likely to stem from initial occupational affiliations (Shu 2012). Our findings also add to the literature on the cyclical upgrading of labor (e.g. Okun 1973, Vroman and Wachter 1977, McLaughlin and Bils 2001, Devereux 2002b). This literature shows that workers move to higher paying employers or occupations during booms and to lower paying ones during recession. The reason is that the labor demand of high-wage employers increases in upturns, reducing competition for their jobs. In recession, when competition is correspondingly higher, the average education level for new hires increases (Devereux 2002b). Naturally, this indicates a reallocation of talent over the business cycle. In particular, it appears that in booms workers with a lower skill endowment are able to enter jobs which they would not enter in a recession. Our findings quantify the resulting effect on productivity and output for one particular occupation. Another debate that our paper contributes to is concerned with the impact of science funding on research productivity. Funding increases, like recessions in our context, raise the attractiveness of the academic sector compared to the private sector. Goolsbee (1998) shows that up to 50% of a government spending increase goes into higher salaries for scientists and engineers. Suggesting that the supply of such knowledge workers is relatively inelastic, he argues that a large fraction of governmental research funding may in fact be ineffective and may only constitute a windfall gain for scientists. To the contrary, our results imply that the quantity and / or quality of scientists should strongly and persistently increase with more funding. 5 capital accumulation, employer learning, stigma, search, and others. 5 Along these lines, Freeman and van Reenen (2009) assert that, at least in the long run, not only the number of scientists but also the selection of talent into science will increase due to higher The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. We derive our theoretical predictions from a modified version of the Roy Model in the next section. Then we describe how we assembled our novel dataset of PhD economists' career choice and publication success. Section 4 presents and interprets the empirical results, while the conclusion discusses to what extent our results may generalize to other segments of the labor market. The appendices contain robustness checks that seem important to us but would disturb the flow of the argument in the main text."}, {"section_title": "Theory", "text": "We are interested in how the selection of skills into academia and business varies with the state of the business cycle. This section modifies a standard Roy (1951) model for the problem at hand. The Roy Model analyzes the self-selection of individuals with heterogeneous skills into sectors according to their highest expected earnings. In the following, we model two sectors-academia and business-into which individuals can self-select. Every individual has distinct skills (and therefore different wages) in each sector but can choose only one occupation. The main departure from the original Roy framework is that compensation in business and academia vary with the business cycle and that the number of open positions in academia is assumed to be fixed."}, {"section_title": "Assumptions", "text": "Suppose that individuals are endowed with two skills, an academic skill \u03b1 and a business skill \u03b2. There are two sectors, academia (A) and business (B), which produce outputs utilizing the respective skills. Individuals maximize their expected lifetime compensation by applying for jobs in academia or business. This compensation implicitly consists of a pecuniary and a non-pecuniary component, where the non-pecuniary component might be particularly important in the academic sector (see Stern 2004)."}, {"section_title": "salaries.", "text": "The business sector is assumed to hire anyone offering a compensation w t . The compensation depends linearly on the skill level \u03b2 of the employee and the state of business cycle\u1ef9 t : An employee's lifetime compensation in the business sector is higher in a boom (high y t ) and lower in a recession (low\u1ef9 t ). In academia, total compensation also varies with the business cycle but is less cyclical than in the business sector: 6 w A (\u03b1) = \u03b1 + a\u1ef9 t with a < 1. Two sources may contribute to the variability of compensation over the business cycle: First, in a recession, lower immediate wages can lead to a lower lifetime compensation in both setors. Second, during recessions employees enter inferior career paths in business or start at a lower ranked institution in academia, which could hurt lifetime income and non-pecuniary benefits. This is consistent with recent findings (e.g. Oyer 2008, Oreopoulos, von Wachter, andHeisz 2012). Importantly, we assume that the academic sector is less cyclical than the business sector and we provide empirical evidence supporting this assumption in appendix B, where we show that academic job offers for economists are less cyclical than non-academic ones and we argue that the non-pecuniary benefits from academia should make its even less cyclical. In order to become an academic, an individual must decide for academia twice: first by applying to a PhD program (at time of application t = app) and a second time by pursuing an assistant professorship after the PhD (at graduation t = grad). At time of application, we assume that PhD programs admit the best N applicants according to academic skill and that there are always more applicants than available 6 We provide empirical evidence supporting this assumption in Appendix B spaces. 7 Thus, the entry into the doctoral program is competitive. 8 At graduation, we do not know if only a fixed number of academic jobs are available or if graduates can freely choose to stay in academia: Obtaining an assistant professorship at a ranked university is very competitive, indicating that only a limited number of spaces are offered. However, conditioned on graduating from one of the top 30 US economics departments, it also seems unlikely that a student cannot secure an academic job at a lower ranked institution, a teaching college, a university outside the United States, or a postdoc position even in times of recession. Probably, the truth lies somewhere in between these two extremes, so we derive predictions for both cases. When taking his decision to apply for a PhD program, the applicant should also take into account the option value of having another choice about his career path after graduation. To simplify our problem, we assume that this option value is a constant, i.e. that it does not vary with the state of the macroeconomy at the time of application. 9 Thus, we can subsume this constant in the individual's non-varying compensation component, the academic skill level \u03b1. Given these assumptions, an individual compares the expected compensation from academia \u03b1 + a\u1ef9 t and business \u03b2 +\u1ef9 t at time of application and at graduation. He decides to apply for the academic sector (the PhD program or the assistant professorship) whenever where t \u2208 {app, grad} and y t \u2261 (1 \u2212 a)\u1ef9 t . y t is the relative attractiveness of the 7 PhD entry cohort sizes as measured by the number of full-time, first-time graduate students, are not related to the business cycle in our data (see Appendix C). 8 The allocation is therefore governed by absolute advantage for those individuals who prefer academia (see Sattinger 1993). 9 In effect, this assumption amounts to imposing that the business cycle at time of application has no predictive power for the business cycle at graduation. We think that this is defendable as it takes on average six years to complete a PhD and we show in Appendix C that there is no correlation between the business cycle at time of application and graduation in our data. In general, we expect that our results should also hold in all of the cases where there is a reversal in the business cycle during that time frame, i.e., P r(\u1ef9 Boom  business sector that is due to the business cycle. 10"}, {"section_title": "Predictions", "text": "We are interested in how the selection of skills into academia and business varies with the state of the business cycle.  Figure 1 illustrates Proposition 2.1 when academic and business skills are distributed uniformly in the unit interval. Given our assumptions, an individual's career choice is governed by a \"one-shot\" decision, with those individuals for whom \u03b1 > \u03b2 + y app preferring academia. During a boom (a high y Boom app ), fewer individuals apply for academia than during a recession (a low y Rec app ), which is depicted by a higher cutoff line for the former than for the latter. Academic employers always hire a fixed number, N , of graduates (PhDs & \"only in boom\" in boom, PhDs & \"only in recession\" in recessions) and therefore the distribution of skills for the recession cohort lies to the \"North-East\" of the corresponding distribution for the boom cohort. However, Proposition 2.2 shows that fewer of the PhDs who were admitted in a recession remain in academia and become assistant professors after the PhD. 10 We could have added to the model that a PhD constitutes an investment into academic (and business) skills. This is clearly an important feature of obtaining a graduate education and we did this in an earlier version of this section. However, as long as the skill update and the uncertainty about it can be assumed to be independent of the state of business cycle, it does not change the predictions of the model other than by adding noise. Hence, we refrain from defining different (updated) \u03b1s, \u03b2s, and y t s at PhD application and graduation. 11 On the flipside, this implies that the joint distribution of skills selected into business during a boom first order stochastically dominates its recession counterpart. Note that in contrast to the well known result of the general Roy model (e.g. see Heckman and Honore 1990), we can make a definitive statement about the stochastic dominance for a general distribution of skills here. This is due to the assumption of binding quantity constraints and the resulting competitiveness of the admission into the academic sector. The proposition implies that, on average, cohorts of PhD graduates more often leave academia if they experienced a recession at the time of application. Figure 2 provides some intuition for the proposition. The academic skill cutoff, above which individuals will prefer academic employment after the PhD, \"on average\" moves down to the dashed line in the figure for a boom cohort and up for a recession cohort. Thus, in the figure, some individuals of the recession cohort exit academia and enter business after the PhD when the economy is out of recession, while everyone in the boom cohort stays in academia. The recession graduates who leave academia here are the marginal ones who applied for the PhD \"because of\" the recession in the first place.  Proposition 2.3 implies that, no matter how many more recession students than boom students leave academia after the PhD, the recession students who remain in academia are still better in each quantile of their (academic) skill distribution. In our specific example in Figure 2 we see that, although some mass of the recession cohort is cut off, the recession distribution of skills in academia still lies to the \"North-East\" of the boom distribution. We now turn to the effect of the business cycle at graduation (y grad ). In a recession, relatively more graduates want to take up academic employment than in a boom. If all of these graduates can take up an academic occupation, more academics come out of a recession-at-graduation cohort than out of a boom-at-graduation cohort. Depending on the underlying skill distribution, these additional academics might be less or more able than the ones always staying in academia. If only a fixed number can take up an academic position (independently whether there is a boom or bust), a recession leads to (on average) better academics. Proposition 2.4 states this observation and its implications.    As mentioned above, the number of spaces in academia at graduation is probably neither completely flexible nor completely fixed, therefore we expect a combination of these two effects. In addition, this proposition implies that the average PhD cohort who graduated during a recession publishes weakly more, because weakly more PhDs choose to enter academia (if spaces at graduation are flexible) or better PhDs enter academia (if the number of jobs are fixed). Finally, we can reformulate the four propositions of the model into empirical predictions for our data: 1. Fewer of the economists who experienced a recession at the time of application to the PhD end up in academia (from Proposition 2.2). 2. However, those who remain in academia are better researchers, both on average and in each quantile of their publication distribution (from Proposition 2.3). 3. More and / or better economists who experienced a recession at graduation stay in academia, increasing the publication output for the full sample and/or the academic subsample (from Proposition 2.4). Prediction 2 implies that, when there is a recession at application to the PhD, productivity in academia should rise. Prediction 3 implies that, when there is a recession at graduation from the PhD, overall academic output should rise."}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "We have collected a new dataset of career choices and individual productivity for a large sample of economists in the United States from 1955 to 2004.

We then sum up all these contributions within the ten years after graduation to obtain a productivity measure for every individual in our sample. More specifically, we match the PhD graduates with their publications (including journal title, number of pages and the number and identity of co-authors) in 74 journals listed in JSTOR, a leading online archive of academic journals. We select all journals contained in JSTOR for which a ranking was available. Thus we include all major publications in economics and finance except the journals published by Elsevier, most notably the \"Journal of Monetary Economics\" and the \"Journal of Econometrics\". 16 To ensure comparability among researchers, we restrict our attention to the first ten years after graduation. JSTOR currently only provides full publication data up to the year 2004. With the ten year requirement we can thus rightfully analyze the sample from 1955 to 1994 without placing younger researchers at a disadvantage. Comparing the value of the collected publication records for different researchers over the decades is difficult because the relative impact of economics journals has changed substantially over time (Kim, Morse, and Zingales 2006). Therefore, we construct a dynamic journal ranking with decade specific publication points for each journal from 1950 onwards. For the period from 1960 to the 1989, we use the ranking from Laband and Piette (1994), for the 1990s the equivalent ranking published in Kalaitzidakis, Mamuneas, and Stengos (2003), and for the 2000s the recursive discounted ranking available on the \"ideas\" webpage. For the 1950s we were not able to find a journal ranking and thus decided to extrapolate a ranking for articles published in the 1950s from our 1960s ranking.

"}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "In this section we examine the empirical predictions derived from the modified Roy model. To do this, we estimate the following model in three different specifications: In the first specification, the outcome variable q i,t is the average publication output of a cohort of graduates from university i in year t. In the second specification, it is the average propensity to decide in favor of an academic career after the PhD, and in the third specification, q i,t is the average productivity of those who stayed in academia after the PhD. The unit of observation in all three cases is the average of a given university in a given year, weighted by the number of underlying individual observations. Moreover, the standard errors are clustered on the graduation year level, in order to allow for contemporaneous correlation between the outcome variables in the presence of regressors that do not vary within a given year. We estimate Equation (2) using linear regressions. To identify the average treatment effect of the business cycle measure on the respective outcome variable, we assume that the productivity and the career decisions of a cohort of (potential) PhD economists do not contemporaneously affect the business cycle in a given year. This assumption excludes potential reverse causality. 21 To be able to interpret \u03b2 and \u03b3 exclusively as the causal parameters of the selection effect discussed in the theory section, we need an additional exclusion restriction to be satisfied: we assume that unemployment change affects a cohort's career decisions and publications only in terms of changing their choice of the sector to apply to (the selection effect). 22 Table 5 summarizes the main regression results of the three specifications, each in one column. Every column contains four independent regressions using alternative business cycle measures for the two explanatory variables. The estimated coefficients of the different regressions are reported one below the other. The following subsections explain the results for the three outcome variables in turn. "}, {"section_title": "Effect on the Publications of all PhDs", "text": "The first column of Table 5 shows the effect of the business cycle on the publication output of an average PhD graduate in the sample. Unemployment change, both at time of application and at graduation, has a significantly positive effect on research productivity at the five and one percent level, respectively. These two results are also economically substantial: a cohort on the 90% quantile of unemployment change at time of application is expected to achieve 3.7 publication points more than a cohort on the 10% quantile. This is approximately 12% of the mean. Similarly, if we do the same calculation for the graduation cohort, the difference is 5.5 points, which is 17.6% of the mean. 23 Using the alternative measures of the business cycle as regressors deliver qualitatively similar results as unemployment change. A higher unemployment rate is associated with higher productivity at application and at exit. Positive GDP growth leads to a lower publication productivity and NBER recessions go hand in hand with more publication success. All coefficients are statistically different from zero at least at the five percent level. The only exception is the estimated coefficient for NBER recessions at application which is not significant at conventional levels. Therefore, the effect of the business cycle at graduation is in line with empirical prediction 3: PhDs who graduate during a recession publish more on average because more of them want to stay in academia. As noted in the prediction, the overall effect may be a combination of an \"extensive margin\" effect whereby more PhDs stay in academia and an \"intensive margin effect\" whereby a better selection of PhDs stay in academia. Table 5 reports the regression coefficients of our measures of the business cycle on PhD cohorts' publication success over the first ten years after graduation. In order to obtain a more dynamic picture of the business cycle's effect, Figure 6 plots the coefficients for unemployment change that we would have obtained if our cumulative publication measure had been defined for each out of 1 up to 15 years after the PhD. We can see that the effect on academic output is truly longterm: the level difference in publications between boom and recession cohorts consistently widens over time. Also the slope of change, i.e. the difference in publications between two consecutive years, does not seem to get much flatter. This suggests that, contrary to findings in other markets (e.g. Oreopoulos2012), the initial effects of the business cycle do not 23 Referring to Table 4 above, the difference between the 10% and the 90% quantiles of unemployment change at time of application is 2.4. Multiplying this by the parameter estimate of 1.54 gives a difference in average productivity between \"boom\" and \"recession\" cohorts of 3.7 publication points. Referring to Table 3, this is about the number of publication points one gets assigned for an article in \"Economica\" during the 1990s. From Table 4, we also find that the \"average\" PhD graduate achieves 31.49 publication points. Similarly, multiplying the difference between the 90% and 10% quantile of unemployment change with the paramter estimate of 2.31 at graduation yields 5.549 publication points. This is about 17.6% of the mean of 31.49. seem to fade over time. Note.-The figures show coefficients from regressing the average productivity of a PhD graduate for different time-spans on the change in unemployment rate at graduation, controlling for the change in unemployment rate at application and university-graduation decade fixed-effects. Since we only observe 15 years of publication history for cohorts graduating before 1990, we use correspondingly shorter publications histories for PhDs graduating after that. The theory does not make a prediction which overall effect the business cycle at time of application should have on the publication output of an average PhD graduate. On the one hand, according to Proposition 2.1, graduates who experienced a recession at time of application constitute a better selection of individuals. On the other hand, according to Proposition 2.2, fewer of these individuals are expected to stay in academia and publish after the PhD. Empirically, it seems that the former effect dominates the latter, as a worse business cycle (measured by a large positive change in the unemployment rate, a higher unemployment rate or lower GDP growth) at time of application is associated with a higher publication output of an average PhD."}, {"section_title": "Effect on Career Decisions", "text": "The second column of Table 5 reports how the business cycle is related to economists' career decisions after the PhD. Individuals are more likely to stay in academia when the economy is ailing according to our preferred business cycle measure of unemployment change at graduation. The estimated coefficient is significant at the five percent level. The mean estimates point in the same direction for two of the three alternative measures, but they are not significantly different from zero on conventional levels. These findings give qualified support for empirical Prediction 3 from the theory section: PhD graduates are more likely to stay in academia if there is a recession at graduation. At least part of the increased average output of a recession cohort could therefore come from this \"extensive margin\" effect. Taking the mean estimates for unemployment change literally, a member of the cohort on the 90% quantile of unemployment change at graduation (+1.5%) has a 3.24 percentage points higher probability to become an academic compared to a PhD student graduating on the 10% quantile (-0.9%). The average propensity to become an academic is 60%. The theory also predicts that economists who experience a recession at application to the PhD are less likely to stay in academia afterwards because some of them will enter only because of the recession (Prediction 1). The evidence in Table 5  More generally, we are not sure how to measure the decision between academia and business correctly. We think three different concepts of someone being an \"academic\" are conceivable: First, one could only consider faculty members of higher learning institutions as academics. This definition leaves out staff at international organizations, central banks and other research-focused (governmental) institutions. Second, one could argue that the relevant distinguishing characteristic of an aca-demic is producing novel and original research. And finally, one could more generally consider anyone an academic who works on research-related topics and upholds a relationship with the academic community. The evidence reported in Table 5 is based on the third notion of an academic by classifying anyone as such who is either a faculty member or a member of the American Economic Association (AEA) after the PhD. Table 6 additionally reports the measures of being an academic according to the first two notions. Column three defines an academic as an individual who, according to our data, publishes at least one article in a ranked scientific journal after his or her PhD. The estimated effect for the business cycle at application points in the predicted direction for three out of four measures. The estimated coefficients are significantly different from zero on the five percent level for unemployment change and for GDP growth. The business cycle at graduation is weak and not significant for any of the independent variables. Column four in Table 6 also shows regressions for the propensity to become an academic (according to our preferred academic measure) for a subsample of graduates from the six top-ranked universities, i.e. the tier one schools. The effect here is significant at least on the five percent level and in the predicted direction for three out of the four business cycle measures. We interpret this as evidence that it is actually the individuals at the very top of the skill distribution which are most able to successfully switch back and forth between academia and business and who thus possess what one could call general skills. Overall, we conclude that the results lend support to the predictions made by our theory about the career decisions of PhD graduates. 25"}, {"section_title": "Effect on the Publications of Academics", "text": "The last column of Table 5 shows the results of regressing the publication output of individuals classified as academics on our four business cycle measures. The results here are largely robust to the sample selection according to any of the three definitions of an academic that were discussed above. For all the different measures, the productivity of academics who experienced a recession at time of application is significantly higher than that of academics who applied during a boom. The coefficient is significant at the one percent level for unemployment change and of economically relevant magnitude: comparing the average member of the cohort on the 90% quantile of unemployment change at time of application to a cohort member on the 10% quantile, the former is on average 10.47 publication points better than the latter. This is about 16% of the mean. 26 Figure 7 shows that the effect of the business cycle at application on productivitiy is truly longterm. This is done by considering publications for varying time spans and plotting the resulting regression coefficients of the main specification. We find that the publication gap between academic cohorts who experienced a recession versus a boom at application widens monotonously over time-although the slope seems to slightly flatten after year five or seven. This finding is in line with Prediction 2 which states that the selection of PhD entrants is better during economically difficult times and that this better selection persists to the PhD graduates who stay in academia. In fact, Prediction 2 states that a generic recession at time of application cohort should first order stochastically dominate a generic boom at time of application cohort with respect to academic skill. Therefore, not only the mean but the whole distribution of academic skills should shift to the right if the economy worsens. Table 7 shows the effect of the business cycle on the distribution of publication output within each cohort using quantile regressions. The unit of observation is now an individual academic's publication output. 27 Among those PhDs who are considered academics according to our \"academic\" measure, 45 percent do not publish at all. We therefore restrict Table 7 to the effect of the business cycle on the median of the publication distribution and above. The estimates are in the predicted direction and significant for the upper quan- 26 The 10% quantile of unemployment change at time of application is -0.9 percentage points, the 90% quantile is 1.5 percentage points and the difference is therefore 2.4 percentage points. Multiplying this difference with the mean estimate of 3.27 yields 7.86. The mean productivity for an academic is 48.14 publication points. 27 We only control for university tier-graduation decade fixed effects and their interactions here, because the quantile estimation becomes much less reliable with a large number of dummy controls. The standard errors are not clustered on the graduation year level as this is not straightforward to implement with quantile regressions. Note.-The figures show coefficients from regressing the average productivity of an academic for different time-spans on the change in unemployment rate at application, controlling for the change in unemployment rate at graduation and university-graduation decade fixed-effects. Since we only observe 15 years of publication history for cohorts graduating before 1990, we use correspondingly shorter publications histories for academics graduating after that. tiles of the publication distribution, but they become less significant for the lower quantiles. The reason for this is probably that the \"academic\" measure is not perfect at separating academics who do not publish from individuals who have left academia after the PhD. We know that there are more such individuals among the recession at application cohort, some of which are thus mistaken as low-skill academics. This downward-biases the difference between the publication distributions, most strongly so at the lower quantiles. 28 Table 5 also reports the effect of the business cycle at graduation on the research productivity of academics. According to the evidence in section 4.2 somewhat more PhDs enter an academic career if there is a recession at graduation. Without a 28 If we define an academic according to whether he publishes in a ranked journal instead of AEA membership or appearance in a faculty listing, and thus condition on non-zero publications, our quantile regressions yield positive and significant effects of unemployment change in line with the theory over the entire publication distribution. specific assumption on the distribution of skills of PhD economists, our theory does not make a prediction whether the additional academics who enter at the \"extensive margin\" are of higher or lower academic skill than the average of those graduates who always decide to stay in academia after the PhD. However, as discussed in the theory section, if the number of spaces in academia is not completely flexible at graduation, there is also an \"intensive margin\" effect which stems from a higher competitiveness to enter academia. This improves the composition of talent in academia for cohorts who faced a recession at graduation. The empirical results in Table 5 are consistent with this idea. The estimated coefficients are significant at the five percent level for unemployment changes and levels. They are not significant but in the right direction for GDP growth and the recession indicators. According to our estimates, an academic graduating on the 90% quantile of unemployment change is on average 6.67 publication points better than an academic graduating on the 10% quantile. This is about 13% of the mean of 48.14. Moreover, if there is an \"intensive margin\" effect at gradution, it should be weaker for the elite tier one universities whose students may virtually always be able to get an academic job if they want to. Indeed, table 13 in the appendix shows that the allocation response over the business cycle is stronger for the tier one group and the productivity effect on tier one academics is insignificant. 29 At first glance, the result that academics who experience a recession at graduation are more successful at publishing than those who experience a boom, seems to contradict the findings by Paul Oyer (2006). He shows that PhDs who graduate during a favorable academic job market (which is correlated with economically good times in general) obtain better initial academic placements. He further shows that the first placement has a positive causal effect on an economist's research output by instrumenting the first placement with the state of the academic job market during the graduation year. However, we think that Oyer's and our result may not be contradictory, but that they could actually reinforce each other: suppose that both effects are relevant in reality-Oyer's placement effect and our selection effect. On the one hand, we would underestimate the effect of the business cycle at graduation on the skills selected into academia. This is because we would not take into account the worse placement a recession economist experiences on average, which would lower our measure of his skill, the publication output. Thus, the individuals selected into academia in recession would actually be better in terms of ex-ante skill than our estimate indicates. On the other hand, Oyer would underestimate the causal effect of the first placement on the research output of an economist. This is because he would not take into account the lower average ex-ante skill of a given economist during a boom due to selection."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Recent studies have shown that aggregate labor market conditions can have strong and persistent effects on individuals' careers via the choice of initial jobs. Our article investigates the implications of this result on the composition of talent and thus on productivity across sectors. To guide our empirical study, we build a Roy-style model of occupation choice over the business cycle if the number of workers is fixed in one occupation and if it is flexible: In the first case, the quality of talent in a relatively more stable industry increases in recession while in the latter case its size rises and a quality change depends on the distribution of talent. In the market for economists we find that recessions indeed increase the publication output of the academic sector for the long term by altering the allocation of talent between academia and business. Depending on whether human capital is drawn to sectors with low or high social value during recessions, this reallocation effect might reinforce or cushion the massive harm done by a downturn. Moreover, our results indicate that it is easier for the public sector to attract talented workers during recessions. A contribution of our article is our theoretical model about talent selection for absolute and comparative advantage which gives predictions about talent flows and the resulting sectoral productivity under both regimes. Comparative advantage has been dominant in the literature on the Roy model, but absolute advantage, when the number of jobs is fixed, seems equally relevant: for example, Groes, Kircher, and Manovskii (2010) show that the dynamics of occupational mobility are explained better by absolute than relative advantage. Borjas and Doran (2012) find that the number of faculty positions in mathematics are limited such that a supply shock can push less talented mathematicians into lower-ranked departments or out of the research community. In his survey of assignment models, Sattinger (1993) argues that absolute advantage selection often occurs when the resources that workers utilize for production are scarce and thus have an opportunity cost. The empirical part of our study provides direct evidence for the impact of the business cycle on output and productivity due to the reallocation of talent. This is possible by considering the particular labor market for PhD economists, which provides a measure of productivity with two important advantages: first, publications are largely exogenous to the business cycle while wages and output are directly affected by recessions. Second, publications are easy to attribute to specific individuals and we can assess their quality quite well. In contrast, output in most other sectors is the result of a collaborative process and therefore it is hard to disentangle the individual (cohort's) contribution. The other specific feature of our setting is its two step selection process with competitive admission and the academic versus non-academic career choice six years later. At first glance this seems quite unique. However, early careers in other knowledge-intensive industries are not completely dissimilar: for example, starting positions in law or consulting firms feature an informal training phase of several years with a performance appraisal and promotion decision at the end. If our findings generalize to the labor market as a whole-in this study we are only looking at a particular labor market at the top of the skill distribution-is left for future research. An encouraging step in this direction is the recent paper by Shu (2012), which finds that MIT graduates produce more patents if they graduate during a recession. Her paper also uses a Roy-style model of occupational choice. This points to a broader applicability of our ideas beyond the market of PhD economist. However sensible measures of productivity are much harder to come by in sectors that are not as transparent and individualized as science.

Furthermore, rather than treating N as the absolute number of PhD places like in the main text, it is convenient here to redefine it to be the number of places in the PhD programs as a fraction of the whole population. As in the main text, we compare a generic boom to a generic recession cohort, i.e. y Boom > y Rec . Furthermore, a person applies for a PhD if he has skills such that \u03b1 > \u03b2 + y. In order to facilitate the proofs in the following, we do three more things: First, we define different sets of applicants to keep our notation concise in the rest of this section. Second, we define conditional probabilities to be able to compare different sets with each other. Third, we show that the least able (in terms of academic skills) individual admitted into academia in a recession is academically more able than the least able individual admitted in a boom. This result is used repeatedly in the proofs of the propositions. 1. The following distinct sets of applicants are used in the proofs and illustrated in Figure 8: \u2022 C(onstant) applicants, who enter academia no matter what happens in the business cycle. \u2022 B(usiness inclined), who only select themselves into academia if the business climate necessitates it. \u2022 A(cademically inclined), who want to go into academia but only have the chance to if the group B members don't apply. \u2022 E(xternals), who never go into academia. Note that A\u222aC is the boom cohort and B\u222aC the recession cohort. Furthermore, from our assumption that there are always more people applying for a PhDprogram than there are spaces, it follows that y has an upper bound. 2. We introduce the following notation for the probability of being a member of the set X (or fulfilling the condition X) conditionally on being a member of the set Y: This conditional probability is always within [0,1] and can be interpreted as the fraction of members of Y who are also members of X. If the subscript Y is dropped, we refer to the fraction X compared to all potential applicants. As mentioned above, N is the fraction of individuals actually entering the academic sector, i.e. in a recession N = P (C \u222a B) and in a boom N = P (C \u222a A). 3. We show that the cut-off value \u03b1 s is weakly higher in recession than in boom. A higher cut-off value implies that the least able (in terms of academic skills) individual admitted into academia in a recession is academically more able than the least able individual admitted in a boom. Proof of lemma A.1: Let g y (\u03b1) := \u03b1\u2212y 0 f (\u03b1, \u03b2) d\u03b2 be the percentage of students with academic skill \u03b1 who will apply to the PhD-program. Obviously as the equality 1 \u03b1 Rec g y Rec d\u03b1 = N = 1 \u03b1 Boom g y Boom d\u03b1 has to hold. Proof of proposition 2.1: : First, note that by the definition of A and B, P , which is the definition of first order stochastic dominance. As the argumentation holds analogously for the business skills, this implies a joint stochastic dominance of academic and business skills of the recession cohort compared to the boom cohort."}, {"section_title": "Proof of proposition 2.2:", "text": "In case of y grad < y Boom some or no people in set B leave the recession cohort and nothing changes in the boom cohort. If y grad \u2265 y Boom , all people in B leave. All remaining members of the recession cohort (who are member of set C and may or may not leave) are a subset of the boom cohort and therefore behave alike. Note that, as P(B) = P(A) and all members of B, but potentially only some members of A, leave for y grad \u2265 y Boom , there are always more leavers in the recession than in the boom cohort. Proof of proposition 2.3: Let B be a subset of B. We show that C \u222a B first order stochastically dominates C \u222a A in the partial distribution of academic skill, which is the proposition for y grad < y Boom . It follows for all \u03b1 that and Now one can show as in Proposition 2.2 : The first inequality holds by the decomposition of P C\u222aB (x \u2265 \u03b1) above, the second inequality holds because P (A) = P (B) and the equality holds because P A (x \u2265 \u03b1) = 0 for \u03b1 \u2265 \u03b1 Rec by definition of the set A. for \u03b1 < \u03b1 Rec . The first equality holds by the definition of C and B , the first inequality by the definition of probability measures (it cannot exceed one) and the second equality holds by the definition above.

Note, that the same argument can be made if y grad \u2265 y Boom with A and C being subsets of A and C, respectively, and B = \u2205. This completes the proof.

"}, {"section_title": "B Cyclicality of Academia versus Business", "text": "In our theory section we assume that compensation in the academic sector is less cyclical than in the business sector. In this section we provide evidence that this is a reasonable assumption. We focus on the cyclicality in the attractiveness of academia versus business only at graduation from the PhD. At application, graduate school seems to be clearly less cyclical than business-as was illustrated by the flood of applications to masters and PhD programs during the crisis of 2008/09 (see also Bedard and Herman 2008, Gustman and Steinmeier 1981, Black and Sufi 2002. Ideally, we would like to compare the variability of the total expected lifetime compensation (consisting of pecuniary and non-pecuniary benefits) for the two sectors over the business cycle. Unfortunately, this is not possible for two reasons: First, (variabilities in) non-pecuniary benefits are hard to observe and difficult to compare across jobs. Second, even the monetary component of compensation is difficult to obtain or to approximate. Wage data for the business sector is not consistently available on a yearly basis over longer time periods for economics PhDs. 30 Furthermore, even if wages were available, they are a result of the selection process we are trying to explain (e.g. Solon, Barsky, and Parker 1994). Consequently, it would be sensible to focus on wage offers in both sectors as used by Scott Stern in a similar setting (Stern 2004). Unfortunately we are unable to find such data. In the following we approximate the relative attractiveness of the academic sector by comparing the number of academic versus non-academic job offers for economists over the business cycle. 31 The underlying assumption is that an additional vacancy (weakly) increases a sector's relative attractiveness. The number of new jobs is published annually in the Job Openings for Economists (JOE) director's report in the American Economic Review's Papers and Proceedings issue in May. The academic and non-academic openings are broken up by new and total jobs and listings (employers). Since we want to approximate the decision situation of a graduate in year 30 We do not have access to any employer-employee matched dataset as in Oreopoulos, von Wachter, and Heisz (2012). 31 Oyer (2006) uses the academic job offers as a measure of demand for economists in academia. t during his job market year, we focus on the sum of new job offers from August in year t \u2212 1 to July in year t. 32,33 Figure 9 plots the yearly sums of job offers over the years from 1977 to 2010. Academic jobs are displayed in the upper-left panel and non-academic jobs in the upper right panel. In the lower panel the overall number of job offers is plotted together with the number of academic per non-academic jobs. Academic and nonacademic jobs move together in lockstep, which shows that the academic sector is in fact quite cyclical. However, the relative number of academic jobs to non-academic jobs appears to be countercyclical: even when the number of academic jobs rise, the number of non-academic jobs rises relatively more. The reverse is true in recessions. Therefore, graduates have relatively more business jobs (compared to academic jobs) to choose from in booms than in recessions. To formally test if business jobs are indeed more pro-cyclical than academic jobs, we estimate the following system of equations where the dependent variables are the log of the number of new academic and nonacademic jobs, respectively, and y t is a measure of the business cycle. Then we test if the business cycle has a larger influence on the number of non-academic jobs than on the number of academic jobs, i.e. if \u03b2 N on\u2212Academic is larger than \u03b2 Academic in absolute values. The regressor y t is one of four business cycle measures: recession indicators, unemployment levels and changes, and the log of GDP. The business cycle variables are measured in October of the year before graduation when the mode of job offers for each cohort comes in. The controls include dummies for the switch from seven to ten 32 The seasonality of job offers within a given year follows the job market for each cohort, especially for academic jobs. Job offers reach their trough in June after which they start rising. They literally jump up in October and stay high during the fall after which they decline. We therefore define each yearly sum of job offers according to job market years instead of calender years. 33 We do not use total jobs as we do not know if these jobs are double counted in several months. with a linear time trend. We estimate the outlined specification in levels with a time trend and in first differences. We do this to control for the potential trend or the non-stationarity of dependent and independent variables. Table 8 and Table 9 report the results of these regressions in levels and in first differences. Unemployment and GDP are significantly related to academic and nonacademic job offers in the way that we would have expected from Figure 9. Moreover, in levels, the relationship is significantly stronger for non-academic than for academic jobs. For example, a one percentage point increase in unemployment is approximately associated with a nine percent decrease in the number of non-academic jobs and \"only\" a five percent decrease in academic jobs. Recession indicators do not work   Overall, we would state that we find reasonable support for the assumption that the academic sector is less cyclical than the non-academic sector in the job openings for economists. We think this is some prima facie evidence for our assumption that in downturns the academic sector becomes relatively more attractive as an employer compared to the business sector. Moreover, we think that the above exercise is conservative because of the following reason: the (variation in the) number of job offers is unlikely to approximate well the (variation in) non-pecuniary benefits, which are substantial and probably stable in research related jobs (see Stern 2004). Thus, total compensation in the academic sector might be less cyclical than indicated by the number of job openings."}, {"section_title": "C Cohort Sizes and Timing of Graduation", "text": "This section addresses potential concerns about factors that might confound our results and analyzes possible impacts on our estimates. In the following we address concerns about the size of the entry and exit cohort and the timing of graduation. Lastly, we address a potential correlation of the business cycle at application and graduation. In order to do this, we calculate the number of graduates from our dataset (in the following listed as \"# of Graduates (AEA)\") and match it with the business cycle at application and at graduation. For conciseness, we focus on unemployment change as our preferred measure for the business cycle. Then, we supplement this data with data from the National Science Foundation's \"Survey of Earned Doctorates\" and the \"Survey of Graduate Students and Postdoctorates in Science and Engineering\". 34 From there we obtain the number of full-time, first-time graduate students (\"# of Entrants (NSF)\") and awarded doctorates (\"# of Graduates (NSF)\") for our top 30 universities since 1977. 35,36 We report the partial correlation coefficient of unemployment change at application and at graduation with application and graduation numbers in Table 10. In order to obtain the correct standard errors we aggregate the data to yearly averages. To keep this section concise, we only report for unemployment change and not for all four business cycle measures. These correlation tables are available upon request from the authors. One might have the concern that the number of students admitted to the PhD 34 These surveys are publicly available through the WebCASPAR Interface: \"WebCASPAR Integrated Science and Engineering Resource Data System -NSF Survey of Earned Doctorates/Doctorate Records File,\" National Science Foundation, last accessed 2012-03-16, https: //webcaspar.nsf.gov/. 35 The number of full-time, first-time graduate students is only an imperfect proxy for the number of students entering a PhD, because it also includes master students. 36 In previous versions we erroneously used NSF data on full-time, first-time graduate students and doctorates for all universities in the NSF sample. systematically increases (decreases) in recessions. 37 Within the framework of our model, this would weaken (strengthen) the selection effect at application. However, according to the NSF data, the business cycle at application is not related to the number of full-time, first-time graduate students (compare row five, column two in Table 10). This supports our assumption in the main text. Moreover, the number of graduates in the NSF data and our data (AEA) is unrelated to unemployment change at application to the PhD (compare row three and four, column two in Table 10 and Figure 10). Another concern is that PhDs might time their graduation in order to circumvent entering the private or the academic job market during a time of recession. 38 The effect of such graduation timing on our parameter estimates would depend on whether the high-or the low skilled delay their graduation date: If it is the academically strong students who delay their graduation during recession, this would lead to a downward-bias of our estimates at graduation on productivity and vice versa if it is the academically weak students who delay. In both cases, we only add measurement error to our results at application biasing our estimates towards zero, as long as the unlikely that either group has an incentive to graduate during recession, graduation timing should lead to procyclical cohort sizes. We do not find a relation between unemployment change and graduation numbers according to the NSF data and the AEA doctoral listings (compare row three and four, column one in Table 10), which suggests that graduation timing is not much of an issue. This supports our results in the main text as well as the assumption of no graduation timing in Oyer (2006). Finally, a last concern might be that, contrary to our assumption in the model, the business cycle is systematically correlated with itself in the six years between a cohort's application and graduation. For the same reason we might in this case overestimate the effect of the business cycle on the career decision (i.e. the academic variable) at application and at graduation.

The results are reported in Table 15. Note that the regressors have a much lower variation because we compute moving averages here. Thus, if we want to compare the results in Table 15 to our main regressions in Table 5, we need to divide the point estimates for unemployment levels by about 1.2 and for the other regressors by about 2.6.

We do not have information about whether students are natives or foreigners in our dataset. In terms of our model, if there are foreign academic programs whose hiring is less correlated with the US business cycle than US schools' hiring, this makes demand for economists more inelastic. If those graduates who take the option to go back more often in recessions appear in the faculty listings, the AEA listings, or if they publish in ranked journals, they are counted as academics. This fits our story. If they are not counted as academics, our estimates in Table 5 will understate the effect of the business cycle at graduation on the propensity to become an academic and, depending on whether it is the high-\u03b1 or the low-\u03b1 PhDs who react more to this, our estimates will under-or overstate the effect on the publications per graduate. Note that our model does not make predictions on the latter effect. Another possible effect involving foreign students may be at PhD entry. For example, a recession in a big foreign sending country and a simultaneous boom in the US might lead to a higher proportion of foreign students starting a US PhD program. Since foreigners are more likely to go back to (academic positions in) their home countries after the PhD-and listed publications and AEA membership are less likely abroad-we might mistake them for having left academia. This may downwardbias our effect of the business cycle at PhD application on the likelihood to become an academic. In unreported robustness checks we therefore assemble data from the \"Survey of Earned Doctorates\" and examine how the fraction of foreign PhD entrants and graduates is correlated with the business cycle. We do not find a relationship between those variables. Furthermore if we control for the fraction of foreigners in a graduation cohort in our main regression, all our results remain the same."}]
