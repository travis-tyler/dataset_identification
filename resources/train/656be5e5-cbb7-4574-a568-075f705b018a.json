[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Background. Alzheimer's is a disease for which there is no cure. Diagnosing Alzheimer's disease (AD) early facilitates family planning and cost control. The purpose of this study is to predict the presence of AD using socio-demographic, clinical, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. Early detection of AD enables family planning and may reduce costs by delaying long-term care. Accurate, non-imagery methods also reduce patient costs. The Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS-1) cross-sectional MRI data were analyzed. A gradient boosted machine (GBM) predicted the presence of AD as a function of gender, age, education, socioeconomic status (SES), and a mini-mental state exam (MMSE). A residual network with 50 layers (ResNet-50) predicted the clinical dementia rating (CDR) presence and severity from MRI's (multi-class classification). The GBM achieved a mean 91.3% prediction accuracy (10-fold stratified cross validation) for dichotomous CDR using socio-demographic and MMSE variables. MMSE was the most important feature. ResNet-50 using image generation techniques based on an 80% training set resulted in 98.99% three class prediction accuracy on 4139 images (20% validation set) at Epoch 133 and nearly perfect multi-class predication accuracy on the training set (99.34%). Machine learning methods classify AD with high accuracy. GBM models may help provide initial detection based on non-imagery analysis, while ResNet-50 network models might help identify AD patients automatically prior to provider review.\nBrain Sci. 2019, 9, 212 2 of 16 and positron emission tomography-PET) [4] . As an example, the cost for a brain MRI may range from $600 to $1300 [5] , and for the uninsured or underinsured this might be infeasible.\nDementia is not identical to the normal mental deterioration associated with aging [2]. It is a progressive, chronic disease with symptoms that may include the loss of memory, communication problems, behavioral changes, and personality changes. Individuals with dementia are often not oriented to time or place and may not remember to eat regularly or practice good hygiene. AD is the most common (60%-80%) form of dementia [2] . Normal \"forgetful\" elderly individuals can be assisted to remember; however, those with AD may not even recall reminders. This fact is unsurprising since the etiology of AD (and other dementias) is damage to brain cells visible by imagery. AD is associated with atrophy of the cerebral cortex, which is the outer (grey wrinkled) covering of the cerebrum in the brain. The irreversible atrophy derives from amyloid plaque formation and neurofibrillary tangles. Amyloid (protein) plaques bind to and destroy nerve synapses (where nerves touch) resulting in memory loss, an early symptom of AD. Neurofibrillary tangles, from a twisted protein strand, damage neurons, and nerve synapses.\nAD has an extremely slow onset. The prodromal period may be 10-20 years while plaques and tangles continue spreading through the cortex [3] . Definitive diagnosis is complicated because amyloid plaque formation and neurofibrillary tangles are present even in seniors with good cognitive functioning [6, 7] , although in lesser numbers and without the predictable pattern present in AD brain scans. To that end, diagnostics from brain MRIs, CT scans, and PET scans are useful for monitoring the progression of AD. Brain volume atrophy, especially in the hippocampal areas, also reflects the decline in cognitive functions characteristic of AD pathology [8] .\nScores from longitudinal clinical tests, like the mini-mental state exam (MMSE), clinical dementia rating (CDR), and Alzheimer's disease assessment scale (ADAS), have shown high correlation with AD disease progression [4, 9] . Mapping this association is helpful because it allows clinicians to provide interventions in the asymptomatic preclinical period. To clarify, while there is no cure for AD the progression may be slowed, and the symptoms treated. Common treatments include memory drugs, behavior mediation, sleep treatments, occupational therapy, and assisted living [2] . Thus, the early identification of AD is vital to slowing the progression of the disease."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a degenerative brain disease with no cure [1] . AD is the most common type of dementia; it is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States [2] . AD is characterized by progressive cerebral cortex atrophy leading to memory loss, increasing cognitive deficits, and potential loss of motor functions [3] . In 2019, there were 5.8 million people of all ages diagnosed with AD, the prediction is 14 million with AD by 2050 [2] . Specifically, one in ten people over 65 years of age have AD, with females more likely to have AD than males [3] .\nDue to the lengthy prodromal period for AD, it is commonly diagnosed in seniors [4] . Earlier diagnosis of AD would facilitate treatment interventions and family planning, and it could save up to $7.9 trillion dollars annually [2] . Unfortunately, differential diagnosis of AD is an intense, time consuming, and costly process involving physical and mental exams, laboratory and neurology tests, as well as neurological imaging (magnetic resonance imaging-MRI, computed tomography-CT,"}, {"section_title": "Related Research", "text": "Mapping the progression of AD thorough all six stages requires complex non-linear multifactorial multi-modal modeling. Researchers have used growth mixture modeling (GMM) to model the decay of preclinical MMSE scores of individuals (n = 528) over 75 years of age [10] . GMM was used to detect both group and individual changes. Bhagwat et al. [4] modeled AD symptom progression classes for one thousand participants over six years with the MMSE scores and the AD AS scale. The authors predicted AD progression using MRI imaging, genetic and clinical characteristics, and by applying a Siamese neural network, which is a network with two or more identical equally weighted subnetworks. Zhang et al. [11, 12] used a subset of the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) data (n = 126) and proposed methods to identify binary-coded AD using Eigenbrain imagery. They eliminated individuals under 60 and incomplete observations, modeled AD as binary, limited their analyses to a very small subset of coronal slice images, and used 10-fold cross-validation run 50 times. (Our approach is somewhat similar; however, in this paper, we use 51 slices, all available imagery data, random image generation, and multi-class classification using ResNet-50 on a 20% blinded validation set.) Bansal et al. [13] applied several machine learning (ML) models to the OASIS brains dataset to classify binary-coded AD; however, they used the entirety of the data set, which may have resulted in overfitting and prevented the generation of true performance metrics.\nA related study focused on predicting the individual Alzheimer's disease assessment scale (ADAS) and MMSE scores [14] . The researchers used an anatomically partitioned artificial neural network, cross-sectional baseline data sets, three sets of Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative cohort data, and two MRI measures. Another study used MRI brain images of tissue perfusion and perfusion scores to develop discrimination maps, which successfully distinguished AD, mild cognitive decline, and subjective cognitive decline [15] . Other researchers applied ML to Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative data (n = 805) to predict AD clinical scores [9] . By using soft-split sparse regression-based random forests to estimate missing longitudinal scores they produced more accurate predictions than traditional random forest methods.\nOther research demonstrated that fractal descriptors were more accurate for support vector machine (SVM) classification of abnormal MRI brain images for AD than discrete wavelet transform or empirical mode decomposition [16] . The authors achieved at best 87% binary class classification accuracy on the OASIS-1 dataset using variational mode decomposition. In a very small sample, another study on automatic classification of AD achieved 100% accuracy using SVM and 10-fold cross-validation with 35 test images and 35 controls [17] . Another study used 33 T2-weighted, MRI brain images and used a multiclass SVM, which correctly classified 91% of the 33 images after training [18] . Due to the small size of images, none of the models discussed were applied to a blinded validation set. The study also considered cognitive scores but did not build models devoid of imagery data to estimate performance. Further, neither of these studies provides a multi-class classification nor evaluates non-imagery models as done in this study.\nThis work extends these researchers' efforts. This study has two objectives. The first objective is to build machine learning models, specifically, gradient boosted machines (GBM), that effectively predict both the presence of AD using ML methods without imagery or imagery-related variables. The second objective is to build imagery models using deep learning techniques, specifically a residual network with 50 layers (ResNet-50), that improves previous classification efforts. The significance of this paper follows.\n1. Our multi-class classification of 98.99% may be the highest in the literature for multi-class classification, particularly on a blinded validation set.\n2. There are no other readily available papers that apply ResNet-50 to MRI AD detection.\n3. This may be the first paper to compare both imagery and non-imagery analysis. Non-imagery methods may be particularly relevant to the poor and underserved, as methods that adequately forecast AD without imagery reduce the costs of imaging.

This instrument is reliable in estimating clinical dementia, which is largely related to AD [2] . Since only two cases in the N = 416 data set involved moderate dementia, the values of CDR were recoded as follows: {0 = non-demented, 1 = very mild dementia, 2 = mild or moderate dementia}. This recoding still resulted in imbalanced classes.

These gain field variations were corrected to form an averaged 3D image. Next, the identifying 3D facial and non-brain values were masked. The Talairach space is, then, a 3D coordinate system (called an atlas) used for mapping locations of brain features [26] . The averaged 3D images are spatially normalized into the Talairach space with a transform that maps the subject's brain image to a reference brain and smooths out individual brain anatomy size and shape differences [26, 27] .

A gradient boosted tree ensemble, known often as gradient boosted machines (GBM), is a model that optimizes prediction accuracy based on iterations of weaker decision/classification tree models. A classification tree model seeks to split the independent variables at various points in an effort to create a decision tree that provides a classification vote. Often, the Gini impurity or cross-entropy formulae are used to determine those splits (Equation 1 and Equation 2) [28, 29] . In these equations, k is the number of classes and p i is the proportion of cases belonging to case i.\nGini impurity :\nCross \u2212 entropy : -\nWith these equations, in a greedy fashion the splitting algorithm is trying to achieve homogeneity within each subset of the tree. To avoid overfitting, the trees are pruned by limiting the number of internal splits/branches. In this implementation, individual trees grew no more than three branches to avoid overfitting. Each tree recommends a classification status (e.g., no AD or AD). Figure 2 illustrates a sample classification tree. At a high level, a gradient boosted tree ensemble is a collection of tree models that is derived by sequentially incorporating, in an additive manner, direct residual errors (i.e., boosting). At each iteration a differentiable loss function is optimized (e.g., area under the curve) [30] . A good discussion of trees, forests, and boosting is from Chen [31] .\nThe R Statistical Software Package, XGBoost [32] , was used to implement gradient boosting. The XGBoost implementation of gradient boosting is ideal for this use case. First, this approach has seen considerable success in prediction accuracy across a variety of datasets. Second, XGBoost takes advantage of unique algorithms that minimizes computation complexity, which allows gradient boosting to scale fairly easily in parallel fashion. A hyperparameter grid search provided parameters for use in building the trees and a ten-fold cross-validation provided accuracy metrics. The data for the ResNet were min-max scaled based on the data set minimum and maximum values, {0, 5089}. The minimum value for any voxel is known to be zero; however, extracting the maximum value ensured that no values in either the training or validation set would be below zero. The leakage of information from the validation set was at most one value (assuming 5089 was randomly assigned to the validation set).\nAfter splitting the data into training and validation sets, principal component analysis (PCA) was used to extract significant Eigenbrain imagery separately to avoid bias [33, 34] . Eigenbrains are reconstructed images based on Eigenvectors (orthogonal). Analysis of these structures, rather than original imagery, failed to improve the performance of the ResNet. The NiBabel library in Anaconda Python 3.6 provided the MRI import utility, while scikit-learn provided the PCA algorithm.

A training image generator then rescaled the data to be between 0 and 1 (dividing by 255 for grayscale). That same generator randomly rotated the images up to 20 degrees, zoomed up to 10%, shifted the height and width up to 10%, sheared up to 10%, and horizontally flipped some images.

The model relied on Keras (TensorFlow backend) [35] . ResNet-50 is a residual deep learning network (with 50 layers), which attempts to address the problem of vanishing gradients that occur during back-propagation of convolutional neural networks (CNN). The ResNet-50 model was developed by He, Zhang, and Sun, and an ensemble of these ResNet models of various depths won imagery classification awards [36] . Increasing the depth of the network should increase the accuracy of the network, as long as over-fitting is considered. However, the problem with increased depth is that the signal required to change the weights, which arises from the end of the network by comparing ground-truth and prediction (observed versus predicted) becomes very small at the earlier layers because of the increased depth of the network. It essentially means that earlier layers remain almost unlearned. This is called the \"vanishing gradient\" problem, as the matrix of second order derivatives (the gradient) in the nonlinear optimization that attempts to tune weights becomes near zero. The second problem with training the deeper networks is, performing the optimization on huge parameter space and therefore naively adding the layers leading to higher training error. Residual networks allow training of such deep networks by constructing the network through modules called residual models. This is called the degradation problem. The ResNet-50 architecture is documented in [37] . The loss-metric optimized was categorical cross-entropy (formula 2).\nConvolutional blocks are a major component of the ResNet-50 model. These networks apply multiple filters (e.g., 3 \u00d7 3-pixel size filter) to images to classify. These filters are moved by strides across the original image. The values in the filters (which are learned) are multiplied against the values in the images. The results of those filters are pooled (e.g., maximum values extracted after the application of filters), which is effectively down sampling while retaining the most important features.

No patients under the age of 60 were diagnosed with dementia, as this is a rare event. One might assume that in GBM models, then, age would be the most important predictor (it is not). The table of dementia vs. non-dementia patients and associated statistics and frequencies adopted from the OASIS (2018) data is shown in Table 1 . Due to the apparently dichotomous split at age 60, imagery and non-imagery models were run with the entirety of the dataset as well as with a subset of those 60 and above. ResNet-50 is capable of handling imbalanced data without techniques such as synthetic minority oversampling when trained sufficiently. Oversampling techniques often helps GBM models. Most of the patients in the dataset exhibited no dementia (n = 316). Only two demonstrated moderate dementia. Table 2 provides the frequency distribution for CDR by gender. Due to only two individuals experiencing moderate dementia, CDR 1 and CDR 2 were combined for the imagery analysis.

The two most important variables in predicting AD were MMSE and (of course) age.

The multi-class classification accuracy of 98.99% achieved using image recognition and ResNet-50 are superior to others found in the literature ( [11] (95%), [12] (96.5%), [16] (87%), and [18] (97%)) with the exception of another very small study in [17] (100% 10-fold CV), and such results support the notion that ML methods might be used as the first screening for diseases such as AD. In all cases, these studies consisted of smaller samples. Such results support the notion that ML methods might be used as the first screening for diseases such as AD.\nAnother interesting finding was that while image methods may support radiologists' processes, non-imagery methods were reasonable at classifying the present of AD during screening. The area under the curve in eight of the 10 folds was 96% or better. MMSE and age were powerful screening tools for AD. Coupling these tools with ML imagery analysis to support radiologists and physicians may help to diagnose earlier. An MRI generated for any reason might be automatically screened as part of a best-practice policy.\nThe ResNet-50 multi-class classification itself is an improvement over previous studies such as [12, 13] that used cross-validation (which exposes the validation set to the same pre-processing as the training set thus inducing bias) and binary classification. Further, it demonstrates that ResNet-50 can provide excellent predictions when trained and applied to Alzheimer's MRI imagery. The study team saved the trained weights for use in additional medical image classification and is providing the code for replication.\nThere were several limitations of this study. First, only 51 slices of each patient's MRI were used in the imagery analysis. Doing so might have eliminated slices that were helpful in diagnosing AD. Second, the actual number of individuals in the study, 416, was small (although the number of images was certainly sufficient). This limits the generalizability of the findings for both the GBM and ResNet models, as they would need re-training on an additional dataset. This retraining is not problematic, but slightly different classification accuracies would be likely.\nFuture work will investigate the classification capability of the pre-trained ResNet-50 on some additional datasets including ADNI and will extend to time series (longitudinal) MRIs. Further, some modifications of ResNet, implementation of other network schemes, and early identification based on longitudinal analysis will be explored.\nWhat is noteworthy here is that the analysis with and without imagery resulted in reasonable classification accuracy. The implication here was that AD might be detected by the MMSE and the associated socio-demographics of the patient early on without imagery evaluation, potentially reducing costs. Further, feeding information already collected into ML algorithms might help identify patients at risk. In addition, application of ML image recognition to MRIs will successfully code and classify AD for confirmation by providers with high accuracy, even if a patient's intended visit was not for AD. ML algorithms may flag these images automatically for review. "}]
