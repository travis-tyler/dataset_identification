[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Introduction: The prevalence of childhood cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors often increases in more rural geographic regions in the USA. However, research on the topic often has conflicting results. Researchers note differences in definitions of rurality and other factors that would lead to differences in inference, including appropriate use of statistical clustering analysis, representative data, and inclusion of individual-level covariates. The present study's objective was to examine CVD risk factors during childhood by geographic distribution in the US Appalachian region as a first step towards understanding the health disparities in this area. Methods: Rurality and CVD risk factors (including blood pressure, body-mass index (BMI), and cholesterol) were examined in a large, representative sample of fifth-grade students (N=73 014) from an Appalachian state in the USA. A six-category Rural-Urban Continuum Codes classification system was used to define rurality regions. Mixed modeling analysis was used to appropriately cluster individuals within 725 unique zip codes in each of these six regions, and allowed for including several individual-level socioeconomic factors as covariates. Results: Rural areas had better outcomes for certain CVD risk factors (lowest low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and blood pressure (BP) and highest high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C)) whereas mid-sized metro and town areas presented with the worst CVD risk factors (highest BMI% above ideal, mean diastolic BP, LDL-C, total cholesterol, triglyceride levels and lowest HDL-C) outcomes in children and adolescence in this Appalachian state. Conclusions: Counter to the study hypothesis, mid-sized metro areas presented with the worst CVD risk factors outcomes in children and adolescence in the Appalachian state. This data contradicts previous literature suggesting a straightforward link between rurality and cardiovascular risk factors. Future research should include a longitudinal design and explore some of the mechanisms between cardiovascular risk factors and rurality. . Data from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) shows that, in the USA, 14% of adolescents had elevated BP, 22% had borderline-to-high or high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), 6% had low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (NHANES: 1999(NHANES: -2008 4 and 32% children aged 2-19 years were either overweight or obese (NHANES: 2009(NHANES: -2010 \n. Pediatric obesity also increases the likelihood of development of other CVD risk factors during childhood and adolescence 2 . Moreover, research shows that childhood CVD risk factors such as obesity, high BP, and abnormal lipids also track over time into adulthood 6 . Several studies have examined CVD risk factor prevalence and its contributing factors by stratified analysis of various sociodemographic characteristics (such as age, gender, racial/ethnic background and income) 4, 5, [7] [8] [9] ; a select few have examined these differences by urban and rural geographic distribution in the USA. These studies have revealed mixed findings by age. For example, data from a nationally representative study showed that older rural children (12-19 years) had 30% higher odds of being overweight or obese compared to urban children, although no significant differences were observed in younger children (2-11 years)\n. A recent meta-analysis using data of US children aged 2-19 years found that rural children compared to urban children are 26% more likely to be obese (odds ratio (OR)=1.26; 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.21-1.32)\n. Different states have different rural/urban prevalence distributions by CVD risk factors as well. For example, a study in North Carolina found no differences in total cholesterol (TC) and BP of rural and urban children, but found obesity rates to be significantly greater for rural children within the state 12 . Another study demonstrated a significantly higher prevalence of obesity in rural children when compared to children living in metropolitan centers of Pennsylvania\n.\nThe mixed findings on the differences of urban/rural prevalence of various childhood CVD risk factors suggest the importance of investigating this issue further. Some researchers suggest that merely living in a certain geographic location is not, in itself, a risk factor, but factors that differ between urban/rural residence contribute to the observed differences in CVD risk factors\n. Others argue that there remains a strong link between rurality and obesity that cannot be explained by demographic factors alone\n. Some researchers have reasoned that the mixed findings may be due to the broad classification of urban/rural (81% vs 19%) or metropolitan/non-metropolitan areas (85% vs 15%)\n. A nationally representative study using census block-group level found no significant associations between urban/rural status and childhood obesity after controlling for individual-level and zip code-level covariates\n. In comparison, researchers using nationally representative data of grade 7-12 students classified neighborhood patterns in six categories and found that adolescents in select neighborhoods, including those living in rural working class, ex-urban, and mixed-race urban areas, were approximately 30% more likely to be overweight compared to those living in the newer suburban areas, independent of age, race, and socioeconomic status 17 . Thus, carefully defining urban and rural locations may be an important piece of the puzzle. In order to overcome the limitations of the broad classification system, the US Department of Agriculture has introduced a multitier classification scheme derived from the Office of Management and Budget and US Census definitions, which includes the Urban Influence Codes, Rural-Urban Continuum Codes (RUCC), and the Rural-Urban Commuting Area\n. For the purpose of this study the authors used the nine-tier RUCC classification system, which is based on county-level data that can be matched to zip codes, and broken down into finer \u00a9 CL Lilly, A Umer, L Cottrell, L Pyles, W Neal, 2016.

Thus, in addition to carefully defining rural urban divisions, this study includes several of these predefined factors, including appropriate use of statistical clustering analysis, representative data, and inclusion of some individual socioeconomic factors.\nThis exploration of the topic begins in a section of the USA with a large rural population. The Appalachian region consists of 420 counties in 13 states of which 42% of the population lives in rural areas 20 . Appalachian populations generally have higher rates of CVD risk factors and CVD mortality compared to the rest of the nation\n. According to the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System 2013 survey, West Virginia, a state entirely located in the Appalachian region, now ranks number one in adult obesity in the nation 22 . The 2011 Youth Risk Behavior Survey showed that 15.7% of adolescents were overweight and 14.6% were obese in West Virginia compared to the national averages of 15.2% and 13% respectively 23 .\nIn order to understand the geographic disparities in youth CVD risk factors, the authors aim to examine rurality and CVD risk factors in a large, representative sample from the Appalachian state of West Virginia, using appropriate clustering analytic techniques and controlling for several individual-level socioeconomic factors. It is hypothesized that more rural regions will be associated with poor CVD risk factor outcomes.

Average findings for the program period demonstrate that from 1998 to 2014, 47.1% of fifthgrade students in West Virginia were either overweight or obese (body-mass index (BMI) percentile\u226585th). Only fifthgrade participants receive lipid profiles and thus are the only participants included in this study.\nWith an active consent process for parents of fifth-grade participants, response rates by year range from 31% to 49% since 1998. These response rates for a health surveillance program are typical of the active consent process in elementary and middle school settings 34, 35 . Previous work has shown that the differences between participants and nonparticipants are minimal. Non-participants are less likely to have a primary care provider and to have health insurance, but there is no difference in BMI or any other demographic variables analyzed in the present study\n.\nThe comprehensive risk screening for fifth-grade participants included calculation of BMI from height and weight, resting diastolic BP (DBP) and systolic BP (SBP), and either a fasting or non-fasting lipid profile (FLP).\nChildren's heights (cm) and weights (kg) were measured using the SECA Road Rod stadiometer and the SECA 840 Personal Digital Scale.

Students were asked to remove shoes and outerwear prior to height and weight measurements.\nThese measurements were used to determine each child's BMI and BMI percentile, calculated using CDC Epi Info v3.5.4 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; http://www.cdc.gov/epiinfo). Percentage above ideal BMI (BMI% above ideal) was calculated using 100*log base e (BMI/median BMI) 37 to control for age, gender and height and avoid the ceiling effect seen when using BMI percentile.\nBP was taken after the child had been resting for 5 minutes.

Consistent blood specimens were taken since 2003, and all labs (hospital and the laboratory) used consistent methods to process the specimens.\nRUCC were retrieved by zip code from the Missouri Census Data Center using the Beale 2003 RUCC code; multiple codes within zip codes were resolved by taking the largest proportion within the zip code.

Table 1 shows number of CARDIAC participants within each region. Significant nested omnibus effects were seen for all outcomes after controlling for covariates, including BMI, HDL, SBP, DBP, log-transformed TRIG, LDL, and TC (p<0.0001; . The authors instead note particularly poor outcomes in mid-sized metro areas in the Appalachian state of West Virginia, using clustered analysis techniques, representative sample, and adjusting for individual-level covariates. The mid-sized metro areas include counties in metro areas having a population density of 250 000 to 1 million, which is an urban/metropolitan area according to the binary urban/rural or metropolitan/nonmetropolitan classification system. Specifically, mid-sized metro and urban areas presented with the highest average BMI% above ideal for age and gender among fifth-grade participants in the state, the lowest HDL-C, and highest mean DBP, LDL-C, TC, and log-transformed TRIG levels. In contrast, the rural areas (population density <2500) tended to have among the best outcomes for certain CVD risk factors, including LDL-C, HDL-C, and BP.\nAlthough the authors note that rural areas have better outcomes compared to other regions in West Virginia, these regions continue to have high CVD risk compared to other regions in the nation 23 . It is also noted that large metro areas generally presented with some of the best outcomes in the state, perhaps most consistent with previous research. However, large metro also presented the highest average DBP. This may be an artifact of only one region in West Virginia being considered large metro: the eastern panhandle of West Virginia, a distal suburb of Washington DC. Again, an examination of intervening mechanisms is needed. Although not a focal point of this article, examination of the covariates also yields some interesting findings. Female students generally had improved outcomes over males, except for HDL-C and log TRIG. This may be due to lower cholesterols occurring with puberty at younger ages in females. As maternal education increased, outcomes consistently improved on average. Although the majority of the state of West Virginia is white, this study notes worse outcomes in terms of BMI, SBP and DBP for other racial groups, but surprisingly improved outcomes such as HDL-C and log TRIG among all other racial groups.\nLimitations include use of cross-sectional data, limiting any type of causal inference. Beale RUCC codes were from 2003, so more recent zip codes added since 2003 could not be included in this analysis. Additionally, Beale RUCC codes are based on county-level data, which limits within-county conclusions. Also, the authors could not explore mechanisms for the associations between geographic locations and CVD risk outcomes in this particular study. Despite these limitations, these results add to the literature in terms of presenting data representative of the generally rural Appalachian region with appropriate statistical modeling techniques and individual-level covariate inclusion. Furthermore, this study used the RUCC classification system and aims to overcome some of the potential limitations of a broad binary classification system that fails to account for some of the variances present in areas that have a population greater than 2500 but are either adjacent to a metro area (small metro) or not adjacent to a metro area (non-metro urban). Results themselves were counter to the authors' prior hypotheses, suggesting the relationship between rurality and CVD risk factors to be more complex than previously supposed. The study adds to the understanding of the differences in geographic CVD risk factors distribution in the Appalachian region of West Virginia. Future research is needed to identify the factors associated with the differences observed. This can lead to potential interventions geared specially in geographic areas where the risk factors are significantly higher.
