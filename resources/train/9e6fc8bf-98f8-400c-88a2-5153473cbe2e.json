[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Statistical methods have been developed for the analysis of longitunal data in neurodegenerative diseases. To cope with the lack of temporal markers -i.e. to account for subject-specific disease progression in regard to age -a common strategy consists in realigning the individual sequence data in time. Patient's specific trajectories can indeed be seen as spatiotemporal perturbations of the same normative disease trajectory. However, these models do not easily allow one to account for multimodal data, which more than often include missing values. Indeed, it is rare that imaging and clinical examinations for instance are performed at the same frequency in clinical protocols. Multimodal models also need to allow a different profile of progression for data with different structure and representation.\nWe propose to use a generative mixed effect model that considers the progression trajectories as curves on a Riemannian Manifold. We use the concept of product manifold to handle multimodal data, and leverage the generative aspect of our model to handle missing values. We assess the robusteness of our methods toward missing values frequency on both synthetic and real data. Finally we apply our model on a realworld dataset to model Parkinson's disease progression from data derived from clinical examination and imaging."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Linear mixed effect model estimated via EM have been introduced for the analysis of longitudinal data [1] , and later were extended for more flexibility to the non-linear [2] case. Well adapted with an objective time (e.g. relative to an event), they are less adapted to data that do not include such consistent time event, such as neurodegenerative disease progression. In [3, 4] the concept of Time Warps is introduced to account for age variability at onset, and in [5] a morphological age-shift. However these Time Shifts are not estimated in the context of a statistical model. Generalization of LME to Riemannian manifolds were proposed [6, 7] , that allows to consider features defined by smooth constraints, such as images or mesh [8] . In [9] , a generic spatio-temporal model is introduced in the Bayesian framework, modeling the course of biomarker's progression as a geodesic, as well as individual variations via parallel transport, travelled at subject-specific onset and speed with an affine time reparametrization.\nAlthough this approach allows mutivariate data, it assumes the same profile of progression (e.g. linear, logistic, exponential, etc..) for all coordinates, and does not account for missing values, leading to the removal of all visits with at least one missing values from the analysis, or to the use of ad-hoc data imputation procedure. This can be problematic for multimodal data where missing values (denoted NAs) occur by design of the experiment. We propose to build on this model to extend its application range, assuming missingness is unrelated to the data (Missing Completely at Random) [10] . We allow the modeling of the joint progression of features that are assumed to offer different evolution profile, and handle the missing values in the context of a generative model."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "The general model", "text": "In [9] each data point is seen as a point in a Riemmannian manifold, denoted y i,j , observation of the i-th subject at its j-th visit. These points are then considered as noisy samples along an individual trajectory, namely a curve on the manifold, which in turn is seen as a random spatiotemporal transformation of a reference geodesic on the manifold. The model y i,j projected on the kth modality can be written as: Fig. 1 . Representation of the model on a schematic manifold. Each point \u03b7 wi (\u03b3 0 , t) is obtained via the continuous transportation of the tangent vector w i along the reference geodesic \u03b3 0 (in red). \u03b7 wi (\u03b3 0 , .) (in purple) is a \"parallel\" of \u03b3 0 .

To assure a unique decomposition through both the spatial and temporal transformation, the w i are chosen orthogonal to v 0 in the tangent space at p 0 . A spatiotemporal transformation of the reference trajectory to the ith patient trajectory is then parametrized by the individual parameters \u03c4 i , \u03b1 i and w i . A time-shift \u03c4 i represents the delay at onset relative to t 0 for the individual i, to distinguish between individuals with early or late onset. The \u03b1 i models the speed at which the trajectory of individual i is travelled. Then the space-shifts w i accounts for variations in position of the individual trajectory, and model difference in patters of disease progression between individuals. Normal distributions are chosen as priors for \u03c4 i , w i and \u03be i with \u03b1 i = exp(\u03be i ). These parameters are the random effects of the model, whereas \u03b3 0 is the fixed effect, parametrized by p 0 , v 0 and t 0 ."}, {"section_title": "Manifold Product for multivariate Data", "text": "Dealing with a longitudinal and multimodal dataset, we wish to analyze at once the temporal progression of a family of N features, with possibly different evolution profile. Thus at the difference of [9] we consider manifold product that are not necessarily the product of the same univariate manifold M . Each feature k is described by repeated univariate observations y i,j,k on M k that are considered as random perturbations along each trajectory. For each feature we choose a that defines a user-defined profile of progression (e.g. straight line, exponential decay, logistic).

For each one of the obtained dataset, we bootstrap at the patient level the estimation procedure (6000 iterations) to obtain bootstrap distribution of relative estimation errors for both methods. The relative error is computed for each step of the bootstrap as followed : Results are reported in Fig 2. We observe that population parameter's estimation is quite robust to pruning, with a significant difference in performance only visible from period = 6 (2 visits per subjects). On the individual parameters the difference is more striking, the generative modeling approach showing more robustness toward pruning already with only 1 over 2 visits removed."}, {"section_title": "Real Data", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database.

Criteria for patient selection in ADNI1 was mild cognitive impairment at baseline and conversion to AD during the course of the study (MCI-converter), which led to 248 individuals. Patients are followed for an average of 6 visits and the dataset does not include any missing values. True parameters are not known, so we use as a proxy parameters estimated from a run of the estimation procedure on the entire dataset. Similarly to the previous experiment (6000 iterations, same estimation parameters), we subsample patients with NAs at various frequencies, discarding patients that are left with less than 2 visits without NAs and observe the bootstrap distribution of the resulting estimation error in Fig 3. Results show the same trend as with synthetic data, although estimation error is higher. Fig. 3 .

In practice such multimodal data include missing values by design. Instead of using ad-hoc method for data imputation, the generative statistical modeling allows to estimate model parameters by comparing generated data with observations only when they are available. Robustness analysis of the method is performed via the increasing pruning of existing dataset, while the variance of the performance is represented as a bootstrap distribution. The proposed method shows lower performance error in both synthetic and real-world data. This advocates for an extended use of the model, applicable to multimodal data with sparse design. We use thus our model to analyse the main PPMI modalities (motor, non-motor, imaging), and find that individidual parameters correlates with age of diagnosis and alpha-synuclein levels."}]
