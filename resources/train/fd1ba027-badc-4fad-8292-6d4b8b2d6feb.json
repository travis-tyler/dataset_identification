This overview relies on the past climate and sea-level change literature (e.g. NRC, 2012;IPCC, 2013;Church et al., 2013), the more recent sea-level science literature (e.g. Kopp et al., 2014;Kopp et al., 2015;Hall et al., 2016;Sweet et al., 2017;Griggs et al., 2017), the scientific and technical literature specific to the U.S. Pacific Northwest (PNW) coast (e.g. Burgette et al., 2009;Komar et al, 2011), and literature specific to the Humboldt Bay region (e.g. NHE, 2015a;Patton et al., 2017). In 2017, the Ocean Protection Council (OPC) Science Advisory Team released its updated sealevel rise science report, titled Rising Seas in California: An Update on Sea-Level Rise Science (Griggs et al., 2017). The OPC report provides an update on the current state of sea-level rise science, along with a synthesis of the current scientific understanding of potential Greenland and Antarctic ice sheet loss and implications for sea-level rise projections in California. The OPC report also provided probabilistic sea-level rise projections at three locations along the California coast (Crescent City, San Francisco, and La Jolla) based on the approach of Kopp et al. (2014). Tectonic plate boundaries along the U.S. west coast, and the location of Humboldt Bay and Crescent City relative to the Cascadia subduction zone. Tectonic boundary data downloaded from http://earthquake.usgs.gov/learn/kml.php. The OPC (2017) report did not address local issues affecting sea-level rise in the Humboldt Bay region, or provide projections applicable for the region. A key purpose of this chapter is to provide probabilistic sea-level rise projections for the Humboldt Bay region based on the work of Kopp et al. (2014) and the local estimates of vertical land motion by Patton et al. (2017). The updated overview and probabilistic projections provides decision makers the most up-to-date and locally relevant information to support planning and developing adaptation strategies for sealevel rise in the Humboldt Bay region."}, {"section_title": "Global Climate System Change", "text": "In 2013, the IPCC completed its Fifth Assessment Report (AR5). The AR5 states that continued emissions of greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide) will cause changes in all components of the global climate system, affecting temperature and precipitation patterns, ocean temperatures and chemistry, ocean-climate variability, and sea-level rise. The AR5 reports (95% confidence) that human activity is the dominant cause of the observed global climate system warming since the mid-20th century ( Figure 2), with the last three decades being successively warmer than any preceding decade since 1850. Furthermore, atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases have increased to levels unprecedented in at least the last 800,000 years. Carbon dioxide concentrations have increased by 40% since pre-industrial times, with the ocean absorbing about 30% of the emitted anthropogenic carbon dioxide (Figure 3), causing ocean acidification (IPCC, 2013). The AR5 concluded that limiting climate change will require substantial and sustained reductions of greenhouse gas emissions.

There is high confidence, based on proxy records (e.g. salt marsh sediments) and instrumental sea-level data, that GMSL rise increased in the late 19th to early 20th century from relatively low rates over the previous two millennia to higher rates today (Church et al., 2013). The dominant contributors to GMSL rise over the last century are atmospheric and ocean warming, which increases ocean volume through ocean thermal expansion, and increases ocean mass from melting land ice and, to a lesser extent, land water storage and groundwater extraction (Rhein et al., 2013;Church et al., 2013). Analysis of global tide gauge records dating back to the 1880s (Church and White, 2011), and the more recent satellite altimetry observations of sea surface change from 1993 to present (Beckley et al., 2010) clearly indicate that GMSL rise rates have increased since 1993 ( Figure 4, Table 1). The tide gauge reconstructions by Church and White (2011) indicate that the rate of GMSL rise between 1901 to 1990 was 1.5 \u00b1 0.2 mm/yr, and from 1901 and 2010 was 1.7 \u00b1 0.2 mm/yr. The rate of GMSL rise measured by satellite altimetry from 1993 to 2016 is 3.4 \u00b1 0.4 mm/yr (https://sealevel.nasa.gov, data accessed in September 2017), which is two times or more the tide gauge rates listed above. Recently, Hay et al. (2015) reanalyzed the tide gauge data using probabilistic techniques and estimated a GMSL rise rate of 1.2 \u00b1 0.2 mm/yr from 1901 to 1990, which is lower than the Church and White (2011) estimate for the same period. This indicates that the increase in GMSL rates from 1993 to 2016 (altimetry rate of 3.4 \u00b1 0.4 mm/yr) over the 1901 to 1990 rates is greater than previously thought (Hay et al., 2015). Although these methods result in different estimates of the rate of GMSL rise, they all indicate the same overall pattern of increased rates in recent decades.

However, the spatial or ReSL rise can differ from GMSL rise due to a range of factors such as ocean dynamics, climate variability, and sea-level fingerprints (Cayan et al., 2008;NRC, 2012;Church et al.,2013;Kopp et al., 2014;Kopp et al., 2015). Figure 5 shows the monthly mean LSL rise trends at three NOAA long-term (greater than 100-years) tide gauges located on relatively tectonically stable ground (Cayan et al., 2008;Burgette et al., 2009;Bromirski et al., 2011). The three sea-level rise trends are consistent, ranging from 1.94 to 2.15 mm/yr, with the average (2.0 mm/yr) representing an estimate of ReSL rise along the U.S. west coast. This rate is 18% greater than the 1901 to 2010 GMSL trend of 1.7 mm/yr ( Table 1), implying that over the instrument period ReSL rise along the U.S. west coast has been greater than GMSL rise. The dominant factors affecting ReSL change along the U.S. west coast are summarized below. Ocean Dynamics and Climate Variability. Non-uniform sea-level changes arise from ocean dynamics, circulation, heat content, and salinity differences due to freshwater (mass) inputs from ice loss, regional wind and current patterns, and coupled ocean-atmosphere processes from natural climate variability. The most important climate processes along the U.S. west coast affecting sea-level change are the seasonal cycle, ENSO, and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) (Komar et al., 2011;Bromirski et al., 2011;NRC, 2012). Seasonal coastal current and wind patterns (e.g. upwelling) produce variations in sea levels, known as the average seasonal cycle, due to ocean temperature and density changes (Zervas, 2009;Komar et al., 2011). ENSO causes seasonal to interannual timescale climate variability with more active winter storm periods and higher sea levels during the warmer El Ni\u00f1o phase, and lower levels during the cooler La Ni\u00f1a phase ( Figure 6). The PDO is described as an interdecadal ENSO like pattern of climate variability in the Pacific Ocean with warm and cool phases ( Figure 6) that shift on interdecadal timescales of about 20 to 30 years (Zhang et al., 1997;Mantua et al., 1997).

Refer to sources and links for details on how the MEI and PDO indexes were computed. Bromirski et al. (2011) attributes suppression of the ReSL trend along the U.S. west coast since the 1980s ( Figure 5) to changes in the wind stress curl associated with the PDO regime shift in the mid-1970s ( Figure 6). Recently, Hamlington et al. (2016) noted an apparent PDO shift resulting in higher sea levels along the U.S. west coast over the last few years that could persist, leading to higher rates of sea-level rise, similar to the higher rates in the observational record. Sea-Level Fingerprints. Changes to the Earth's gravitational and deformational response to mass redistribution between the ocean and glaciers, ice caps and ice sheets (cryosphere) is known as sea-level or static-equilibrium fingerprints. As land ice melts, water enters the ocean raising A B GMSL; however, a reduced gravitational pull on the ocean water also results from the decrease in ice mass. The overall net effect of these fingerprints is that ReSL will drop near the melting ice masses, and increase proportional to the distance from the ice masses. Vertical land motion. Vertical land motion (VLM) is associated with tectonics, sediment compaction and/or subsidence, and glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA). GIA is the response of the Earth's surface to the retreat of the ice sheets during the last ice age. Regional and local VLM, such as tectonic land-level changes, can be much larger than those associated with GIA models (Zervas, 2009). Along the U.S. west coast, and in particular the CSZ, researchers have documented interseismic tectonic land-level rates from plate locking that are an order of magnitude greater than the global GIA rate (Mitchell et al., 1994;Burgette et al., 2009). Along the PNW coast, the tectonic land-level changes associated with the CSZ strongly affect regional and local sea-level changes (Komar, 2011)."}, {"section_title": "Regional Sea-Level Rise along the Pacific North West Coast and Humboldt Bay Region", "text": "To infer VLM associated with tectonic uplift rates from LSL change at six NOAA tide gauge sites located between Crescent City, CA and Astoria, OR, Burgette et al. (2009) determined an average sea-level rise rate of 2.28 \u00b1 0.20 mm/yr that represents an approximate 20th century ReSL rise rate for the PNW coast along the CSZ. As noted by Burgette et al. (2009), the 2.28 mm/yr ReSL rise rate compared well to the 1950 to 2000 GMSL reconstruction of Church and White (2006), which had trend slopes for grid points offshore of the CSZ of 2.2 \u00b1 0.30 mm/yr. Komar et al. (2011) further assessed the 2.28 mm/yr ReSL rate by comparing LSL rates for the six CSZ tide gauge records to the benchmark and Pacific Northwest Geodetic Array Global Positioning System (GPS) data, and concluded that the rate is reasonable for the PNW coast. Finally, the NRC (2012) study determined an adjusted (for VLM and atmospheric pressure) sea level rise rate of 2.30 mm/yr for the Seattle tide gauge for the 1900 to 2008 period, which is also consistent with the 2.28 mm/yr ReSL rise rate. The 2.28 mm/yr ReSL rise rate is 0.58 mm/yr greater (34% increase) than the 1901 to 2010 GMSL rate of 1.7 mm/yr (Table 1). This implies that natural climate variability (ENSO and PDO), ocean dynamic processes, and gravitational mass redistribution have produced a greater ReSL rise rate for the PNW coast relative to the GMSL rate for the same general period. The Burgette et al. (2009) rate of 2.28 mm/yr has been used by local researchers (e.g. NHE, 2015a; Patton et al., 2017) to represent historic ReSL rise rates for the Humboldt Bay region."}, {"section_title": "Past and Present Local Sea-Level Rise", "text": "Tide gauges measure local sea-level (LSL) change, which is the combined effects of sea-level change and VLM. The measured LSL change includes the same processes affecting ReSL patterns, and other short-term local processes such as wind waves, tides and hydrodynamic effects. As noted by Zervas (2009), VLM is responsible for most of the differences in LSL trends between regional tide observations. For example, although the Crescent City and North Spit tide gauges are only separated by 109 km (~68 mi), the LSL trends for these gauges are in opposing directions ( Figure 7). The downward LSL trend at Crescent City indicates this section of coast is emerging, with an uplift rate greater than the current GMSL and ReSL rise rates. In contrast, the North Spit LSL trend is greater than the GMSL or ReSL rates, indicating that Humboldt Bay is submergent, and in fact, has the highest LSL rise rate of any tide gauge in California. The relatively large oscillations in monthly LSL values around the trend line are due to short-term weather variability (e.g. storms), natural climate variability (e.g. ENSO and PDO), and the average seasonal cycle."}, {"section_title": "A B Local Sea-Level Rise and Vertical Land Motion Rates in the Humboldt Bay Region", "text": "The LSL rise rate at North Spit tide gauge is greater than both the GMSL and ReSL rise rates due to land subsidence in and around Humboldt Bay. To better understand how tectonic land motion affects LSL rates in Humboldt Bay, Cascadia Geosciences and partners received funding from the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service (study plan at http://www.hbv.cascadiageo.org) to utilize tide gauge observations, benchmark level surveys, and GPS data to evaluate tectonic VLM and LSL rates in Humboldt Bay. The tide gauge analysis evaluated water level observations at the NOAA Crescent City tide gauge, and five NOAA tide gauge sites in Humboldt Bay, which include North Spit and four historic gauges located at Mad River Slough, Samoa, Fields Landing, and Hookton Slough (Figure 1, Figure 8). The tide gauge analysis relied on the long-term Crescent City (~84 years) and North Spit (40 years) tide gauges, and the general approach of Mitchell et al. (1994) and Burgette et al. (2009) to determine VLM and LSL rates at the other Humboldt Bay gauges, which all have record lengths less than 30 years and are considered too short to directly determine rates (Zervas, 2009). The analysis also relied on the 20th century ReSL rise rate (2.28 mm/yr) of Burgette et al. (2009). Recently, NHE (in progress) updated the original VLM and LSL rate estimates of Patton et al. (2017) for the Crescent City and Humboldt Bay tide gauges using a weighted least squares adjustment approach as described by Ghilani (2010) (Table 2, Figure 9). The NHE update work is in progress, but reference to the Patton et al. (2017) work can be made for a general discussion of the tide gauge analysis methods and interpretation of results. The north to south down trending VLM gradient controls the LSL rate variation in Humboldt Bay, with the highest rate of VLM in south Humboldt Bay at the Hookton Slough tide gauge. The tectonic deformation in Humboldt Bay increases the LSL rates well above the long-term GMSL and ReSL rates of 1.7 and 2.28 mm/yr, respectively, with both the North Spit and Hookton Slough LSL rates being more than twice the ReSL rate. These higher LSL rise rates indicate that increases in the GMSL and ReSL will affect Humboldt Bay faster than other parts of U.S. west coast; and within the bay, the south end will be affected sooner than the north end. "}, {"section_title": "Sea-Level Height Variability", "text": "Sea-level heights vary due to astronomical tides, storm surge, wind stress effects, changes in barometric pressure, seasonal cycles, and ENSO phases, which results in water levels reaching higher levels over longer time scales (Cayan et al., 2008;Knowles, 2010). Figure 10 shows the hourly water levels for the Crescent City tide gauge for the 1982-83 El Ni\u00f1o years, along with the mean sea level (MSL) and mean higher high water (MHHW) tidal datum, the mean monthly maximum water (MMMW), and the 10-and 100-yr extreme high-water level events. A B Figure 10. Crescent City tide gauge hourly water levels for 1982-83 El Ni\u00f1o years, with mean sea level (MSL), mean higher high water (MHHW), mean monthly maximum water (MMMW), mean annual maximum water (MAMW), and the 10-and 100-yr extreme high-water level events. Most coastal damage to the U.S. west coast occurs when storm surge and high waves coincide with high astronomical tides and El Ni\u00f1o events (Cayan et al., 2008;NRC, 2012), which occurred during the winters of 1982-83 and 1997-98. For example, in late January 1983 a large El Ni\u00f1o driven storm coincided with higher than normal astronomical tides, and produced the highest water levels of record at the Crescent City tide gauge on 29 January 1983, exceeding the 100-year extreme exceedance probability event ( Figure 10 and Figure 11). The peak hourly water level on 29 January 1983 was 66.2 cm (2.2 ft) higher than the astronomical high tide, and on 26 January 1983, the peak hourly water level was 84.0 cm (2.8 ft) above the astronomical high tide. It is important to note that sea-level height variability is superimposed onto mean sea level (Cayan et al., 2008). Consequently, as sea-levels rise into the future, the water levels associated with sea-level height variability described above will also increase, and the incidence of extreme high-water levels will become more common (NRC, 2012).

Sea-level rise projections generally depend on the understanding of contributions to sea-level change, the response of key geophysical processes, and assumptions regarding future warming of the climate system (NRC, 2012, Church et al., 2013. This section summarizes recent probabilistic projections of GMSL rise, and provides probabilistic estimates of LSL rise for the Humboldt Bay region based on the approach of Kopp et al. (2014). The NRC (2012) report produced regional projections along the U.S. west coast for three scenarios (low, central and high), with the central or \"mid-range\" projection having the most weight. The NRC projections covered four regions (Seattle, Newport, San Francisco, and Los Angeles) that varied from the global average due to regional oceanic thermal expansion and dynamics, sea level fingerprint effects, and VLM, and represented the most comprehensive regional projections for the U.S. west coast at the time. Since the NRC (2012) report, significant effort and advances have been made in developing probabilistic projections of GMSL, ReSL and LSL rise (e.g. Church et al., 2013;Kopp et al., 2014;Grinsted et al., 2015). The recently released OPC sea-level science update for California (Griggs et al., 2017) used the framework of Kopp et al. (2014) to determine probabilistic sea-level rise projections at three representative locations along the California coast (Crescent City, San Francisco, and La Jolla). Unfortunately, none of these locations adequately represent the high rates of LSL rise occurring in the Humboldt Bay region due to tectonically driven VLM. The approach of Kopp et al. (2014) provides complete probability distributions for GMSL and LSL rise projections at a global network of tide gauge sites under three emission scenarios, RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 (discussed below). This approach develops individual probability distributions for the sea-level rise components of glacier/ice cap and ice sheet (Greenland and Antarctic) loss with fingerprint affects, oceanic processes (regional dynamic, thermal and steric effects), land water storage, and VLM from process-based model outputs and expert elicitation for the ice sheets. The GMSL and LSL probability distributions were determined by combining 10,000 Latin hypercube samples (a Monte-Carlo approach) from each individual component distribution. The Kopp et al. (2014) GMSL and LSL projections are available for download as supporting information, and include the Crescent City and North Spit tide gauges. The IPCC AR5 adopted a set of greenhouse gas emission scenarios known as Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), which represent future emissions and concentrations of greenhouse gases, aerosols, and other climate drivers (Church et al., 2013). The RCPs (RCP 8.5, 6.0, 4.5 and 2.6) represent future radiative forcing by 2100 (e.g. RCP 8.5 is 8.5 W/m 2 ), and are dependent on various mitigation scenarios including implied policy actions, that have different targets in terms of greenhouse gas emissions and radiative forcing (IPCC, 2013). RCP 8.5 is a very high greenhouse gas emission scenario with high radiative forcing, and represents a future where there are no significant efforts to reduce emissions. RCP 2.6 represents an aggressive emission mitigation scenario leading to low radiative forcing, and requires net-negative global emissions in the last quarter of the 21st century. RCP 4.5 and 6.0 represent moderate emission mitigation scenarios. Kopp et al. (2014) only provides projections for RCP 2.6, 4.5 and 8.0, and notes that the sea-level rise projections for RCP 6.0 are similar to those for RCP 4.5. As discussed in Griggs et al. (2017), recent work on Antarctic Ice Sheet modeling has identified modes of ice-sheet instability that could make extreme sea-level rise more likely than indicated in the Kopp et al. (2014)  The following sections summarize and provide updated sea-level rise projections for the Humboldt Bay region based on the probabilistic projections of Kopp et al. (2014) and the extreme scenario of Sweet et al. (2017), with the local estimates of VLM by Patton et al.

For the LSL projections, VLM is configured as a contribution to LSL change. For example, the VLM at North Spit is negative (Table 2) indicating that the ground is moving downward. This downward land motion increases sea-level rise at North Spit, resulting in a positive LSL rise contribution, as reported in the LSL tables. The opposite occurs for Crescent City. Table 5 lists the VLM contributions to LSL change (mean and +/-2 standard deviations) determined by Kopp et al. (2014) for Crescent City and North Spit, and the NHE (in progress) estimates for these two locations and the Mad River Slough and Hookton Slough sites. The locally generated VLM estimates are higher than those determined by Kopp et al. (2014), which will increase or decrease the updated LSL rates, depending on the site. Table 5. VLM contributions to LSL change determined by Kopp et al. (2014) and by Patton et al. (2017) and NHE (in progress) used in the updated LSL probability projections for the Humboldt Bay region. VLMs are reported as mean and +/-2 standard deviations (SD). The modified LSL projections for Crescent City and North Spit are shown in Figure 13. The 2100 component contributions to LSL rise for Crescent City, North Spit, Mad River Slough and Hookton Slough are provided in Table 6 for the median (50% probability) and different probability ranges (e.g. 90 and 99% probabilities). The total LSL median projection and probabilities at each site for 2030, 2050, 2100, 2150 and 2200 are listed in Table 7, along with the Sweet et al. (2016) extreme scenario (Ext 2.5)."}, {"section_title": "Findings/Discussion", "text": "Comparing the 2100 projections for LSL within the Humboldt Bay region to GMSL (Table 3 and Table 6) show differences between GMSL and LSL rise components, and reveal important regional and local factors that affect LSL change compared to GMSL. Within the Humboldt Bay region oceanic dynamic processes appear to have a limited effect on increasing sea levels beyond GMSL projections, except for small increases for the lower RCPs. Contributions from the glaciers/ice caps and Greenland Ice Sheet are projected to be lower than global averages for all RCPs. The Antarctic Ice Sheet is projected to have only slight increases above the global average for the lower RCPs. However, unlike other portions of the U.S. west coast that are projected to have sea-level rise close to the global average (Kopp et al., 2014), the Humboldt Bay region has LSL projections well above the GMSL projections due to tectonically driven VLM. Crescent City, which is uplifting, has LSL rise projections (50% probability of 0.42 m, 90% probability of 0.11 to 0.88) that are below GMSL projections (50% probability of 0.79 m, 90% probability of 0.52 to 1.21) under RCP 8.5 by 2100. However, North Spit is subsiding, and has LSL projections (50% value of 1.01 m, 90% probability of 0.69 to 1.46) that are above the GMSL projections by 2100 for RCP 8.5. Likewise, Mad River Slough and Hookton Slough also have LSL projections that are above the global average, with Hookton Slough having the highest rates, due to the north to south trending downward VLMs in Humboldt Bay. It should be noted that up to 2050, differences between LSL projections are minimal between RCP emission scenarios, and the RCP 8.5 projections can just be used (Kopp et al., 2014;Griggs et al., 2017). After 2050, differences in projections begin to emerge due to emission scenarios. One final note, large interannual monthly and annual mean sea-level variability as occurs in the Humboldt Bay region (Figure 13) can mask LSL rise over the near term (Kopp et al., 2014). The interannual variability also exceeds the uncertainty in projections (~90% probability) until about 2030 to 2040 for annual mean sea levels, and about 2040 to 2050 for monthly mean sea levels. During these timeframes, the interannual variability, either alone or in combination with the LSL rise projections, should be considered in decision making. The key finding from the updated probabilistic LSL projections is that the tectonically driven VLM in Humboldt Bay creates the highest LSL rise rates in California. These higher LSL rates indicate that GMSL rise will impact Humboldt Bay faster than other parts of the U.S. west coast; and within the bay, the south end will be impacted sooner than the north end.
