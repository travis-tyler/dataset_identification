[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "This annual report presents findings from the Common Core of Data (CCD) \"State Nonfiscal Survey of Public Elementary/Secondary Education, School Year 2000-01.\" Data for this annual NCES survey are collected directly from state education agencies and include the total number of students, teachers, and graduates.\nData from the 2000-01 CCD survey can answer many questions about public elementary and secondary education including the following:\n\u2022 How many students were enrolled in public elementary and secondary schools?\n\u2022 How many teachers worked in public elementary and secondary schools?\n\u2022 What kinds of staff worked in public elementary and secondary schools?\n\u2022 What was the racial/ethnic background of students enrolled in public schools?\n\u2022 How many students graduated from high school during the previous school year (1999) (2000) ? \u2022 How many students are educated in Department of Defense, Bureau of Indian Affairs, and outlying area schools? (Data on the Department of Defense, Bureau of Indian Affairs, and outlying area schools are discussed separately. These data are not included in national totals.)"}, {"section_title": "Selected Findings", "text": "How many students were enrolled in public elementary and secondary schools?\nIn the 2000-01 school year, there were 47.2 million students enrolled in public elementary and secondary schools in the 50 states and the District of Columbia (table 1) . 1 Of these students, 26.2 million (55.5 percent) were in prekindergarten through grade 6, an additional 20.5 million (43.4 percent) were in grades 7 through 12, and the remaining 0.6 million (1.2 percent) were ungraded students 2 (figure 1). Not including prekindergarten or ungraded classes, grade 9 had the most students while grade 12 had the fewest.\nCalifornia had the most public elementary and secondary school students (6.1 million), followed by Texas (4.1 million) and New York (2.9 million). Thirteen states had over 1 million public elementary and secondary students in the 2000-01 school year. The District of Columbia (68, 925) , Wyoming (89, 940) , and Vermont (102,049) had the fewest students. Nine states and the District of Columbia had fewer than 200,000 public elementary and secondary students in the 2000-2001 school year.\nThe 47.2 million students enrolled in the 2000-01 school year represents a 14.6 percent increase in the number of students being served in the public elementary and secondary school system since the 1990-91 school year (table 10) . Between the 1990-91 and 2000-01 school years, Nevada had the largest percentage increase (69.2 percent) in the number of students. Seven states and the District of Columbia had a decrease in the number of students between these years (the District of Columbia, Louisiana, Maine, Mississippi, North Dakota, South Dakota, West Virginia, and Wyoming). The District of Columbia had the largest percentage decrease in students with a 14.6 percent drop. 3 assisted teachers (e.g. curriculum development and in-service training) (table 3) . Teachers made up 51.6 percent of all staff in the 2000-01 school year and instructional aides and coordinators made up an additional 11.9 percent of staff (figure 2). The percentage of all staff who were teachers ranged from 60.0 percent in Rhode Island to 44.1 percent in Kentucky. Vermont had a relatively low percentage of teachers per staff (47.3), the highest percentage of instructional aides (22.1 percent), and the lowest pupil-teacher ratio (table 2) .\nAnother 26.4 percent 3 of all staff (librarians, counselors, and other support staff) provided support services to schools and students. Staff providing support included 97,369 guidance counselors and 54,281 librarians. This translates to 485 students for every guidance counselor reported on average, and 870 students for each librarian. An additional 1.4 million staff members provided other support services for students. These services included food, health, library assistance, maintenance, transportation, security, and other services in the nation's public schools.\nThere were 141,407 school administrators (mostly principals and assistant principals), 58,891 school district administrators, and 380,655 school and district administrative support staff. Administrators and administrative support staff made up 10.1 percent of all education staff. On average, there were 15 teachers and 13 other staff for each district and school administrator. What was the racial/ethnic background of students enrolled in public schools?\nIn the 2000-01 school year, racial/ethnic data were reported for 47.0 of the 47.2 million students enrolled in public elementary and secondary schools in the 50 states and the District of Columbia 4 (table 4) . White, non-Hispanic students made up the majority of students (61.2 percent 4 ) followed by Black, non-Hispanic and Hispanic students (17.2 and 16.3 percent, respectively) (figure 3 and table 5). Asian/Pacific Islander students made up 4.1 percent of the public school population and American Indian/Alaska Native students made up 1.2 percent.\nIn six states (California, Hawaii, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico, and Texas) and the District of Columbia, 50 percent or more of students were non-white. Black, non-Hispanic students made up more than 50 percent of all students in the District of Columbia and Mississippi. New Mexico reported 50.2 percent of its students as Hispanic, and Hawaii reported 72.3 percent of its student body as Asian/Pacific Islander. On the other hand, five states (Iowa, Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, and West Virginia reported that over 90 percent of their students were White, nonHispanic. How many students graduated from high school during the 1999-2000 school year?\nSome 2.5 million students received a high school diploma in the 50 states and the District of Columbia during the 1999-2000 school year and subsequent summer (table 6) . Another 41,638 received other high school completion credentials (e.g., certificate of attendance). These high school completers only made up 1.6 percent of all high school completers (diplomas and other high school completers, not including high school equivalencies). In addition, there were students who earned a high school equivalency certificate; however, a national total cannot be computed because of missing data from a number of states. Note that some states grant only diplomas and high school equivalency certificates and do not recognize any other types of high school completion and states are not necessarily comparable. Imputation of data items. Data for prekindergarten students and staff that were missing and not reported elsewhere by the states were imputed. These items are noted as \"imputed\" in the data tables. The method used for imputing all variables other than prekindergarten students was to: (a) create a subset of states reporting the item in question; (b) calculate the ratio of the missing item to total student membership for each state in the subset; (c) calculate the average ratio of the item to total student membership for the subset; (d) multiply the total student membership of the state with the missing item by the average ratio; (e) substitute the imputed estimate for the missing item and then recompute the subtotals and totals. Missing prekindergarten student counts were imputed by first calculating an average ratio of prekindergarten students to total students minus prekindergarten students for reporting states, and then by following steps (d) and (e) above. Imputations on all states missing a specific data item are done at one time, ie. imputed values are not used in the imputation of another value. Imputation is only done on the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Totals and subtotals are noted in the tables when one or more items included in the total are imputed or adjusted.\nHigh school completers. NCES made no adjustments or imputations to the high school diploma, high school equivalency, or other high school completion data. Not applicable was accepted as a valid response for other high school completers for the 1999-2000 school year.\nThe type of high school completions available to students varies by state policies. For example, in some states the only type of completion available is a regular diploma, while in other states, there are a variety of completion types available from regular diploma to a seat time certificate. For this reason, caution should be used in comparing states."}, {"section_title": "Definitions", "text": "Administrative Support Staff: This category consists of staff members who provide direct support to local education agency and school administrators.
