[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Introduction. Medial temporal lobe atrophy assessment via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been proposed in recent criteria as an in vivo diagnostic biomarker of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, practical application of these criteria in a clinical setting will require automated MRI analysis techniques. To this end, we wished to validate our automated, high-dimensional morphometry technique to the hypothetical prediction of future clinical status from baseline data in a cohort of subjects in a large, multicentric setting, compared to currently known clinical status for these subjects. Materials and Methods. The study group consisted of 214 controls, 371 mild cognitive impairment (147 having progressed to probable AD and 224 stable), and 181 probable AD from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, with data acquired on 58 different 1.5 T scanners. We measured the sensitivity and specificity of our technique in a hierarchical fashion, first testing the effect of intensity standardization, then between different volumes of interest, and finally its generalizability for a large, multicentric cohort. Results. We obtained 73.2% prediction accuracy with 79.5% sensitivity for the prediction of MCI progression to clinically probable AD. The positive predictive value was 81.6% for MCI progressing on average within 1.5 (0.3 s.d.) year. Conclusion. With high accuracy, the technique's ability to identify discriminant medial temporal lobe atrophy has been demonstrated in a large, multicentric environment. It is suitable as an aid for clinical diagnostic of AD."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Medial Temporal Lobe Atrophy as a Structural Biomarker of Alzheimer's Disease Progression.", "text": "Early identification of patients most at risk of progression to dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a crucial clinical and research issue. To address this concern new criteria have been proposed to increase diagnostic certainty and better identify individuals in a prodromal state, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD [1] [2] [3] . In vivo biomarkers of disease progression, both chemical and imaging, lie at the heart of these criteria.\nThe earliest AD-associated brain alterations, according to histopathological staging [4] , occur in medial temporal lobe structures, in particular the hippocampus and entorhinal cortices; they have been reported in amnestic MCI subjects [5, 6] . The AD neurodegenerative cascade results in dendritic pruning, loss of synapses, and eventually neuronal death, resulting in cerebral atrophy of which structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is able to measure. Thus, medial temporal atrophy (MTA) has been reported extensively on the continuum from MCI to AD [7, 8] and is a recognized imaging biomarker in the new criteria [1] [2] [3] .\nThe most validated procedure to estimate MTA relies on expert manual outlining (i.e., segmentation) of individual or ensembles of structures on high resolution T1-weighted MRI, following an established set of anatomical landmarks [9] . While manual segmentation is accepted as the best available technique, it cannot be widely used within a large-scale clinical setting, as the investment in expertise and resources is prohibitively great. This type of application thus necessitates semiautomated or ideally completely automated image processing techniques, as a cost-efficient strategy."}, {"section_title": "2", "text": "International Journal of Alzheimer's Disease"}, {"section_title": "Automated Techniques for MTA Assessment.", "text": "There has been renewed enthusiasm recently over the performance of multi-atlas or template-based approaches for automated segmentation [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . Over the last decadehowever a number of high-dimensional morphometry techniques have arisen that attempt to characterize potentially multimodal image information from a volume of interest larger than a single structure, generally encompassing the medial temporal lobe, and embedding machine learning principles to both characterize and discriminate subject populations [17] . There is increasing evidence that this approach will allow for more accurate determination of AD time course in a number of reports [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . Other notable works include Davatzikos and colleagues with a diffeomorphing-based algorithm to extract high-dimensional patterns [28] ; and Hua et al., who used tensor-based morphometry for similar purposes [29] .\nOur methodology is set within this context. It incorporates local estimates of both tissue composition and deformation within a specific volume of interest (VOI) centered on the medial temporal lobes [30] , providing a structural index related to disease progression [31] . Such changes in tissue composition have been reported via voxel-based morphometry [32] and contrast studies [33] , while volumetry [34] and tensor-based morphometry [29, 35] reports have shown pathology-related deformations in specific brain areas. By incorporating both image features, we are able to capture different properties of the advancing pathological process and predict future clinical status for an individual subject. We have applied this methodology in earlier work to the discrimination of probable AD from age-matched healthy controls [30] as well as the prediction of amnestic MCI progression to clinically probable AD [36] , albeit within a single-center setting."}, {"section_title": "Bridging the Gap towards Clinical", "text": "Use. Clinical application of any one of these automated methodologies require that techniques maintain the same level of performance in a multicentric setting, where large interscanner variations become inevitable due to MRI physics [37] , even though systematic errors (such as different acquisition protocols) are controlled. These random effects will distort image intensities, which in turn will influence image processing and, eventually, classification performance. Not all techniques proposed in the literature have been subjected to this kind of sensitivity analysis.\nAn ideal dataset for this purpose is the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study [38] . For the first phase of ADNI, a total of 822 subjects (229 normal controls (CTRL), 405 individuals with MCI, and 188 subjects with mild AD) were recruited in 58 sites throughout the United States and Canada for longitudinal followup. ADNI was successful in coordinating and implementing a routine imaging protocol at all sites with stringent quality control [39, 40] , thereby ensuring that all scans were similarly acquired, reducing systematic errors.

However, if the determinant is positive, the volume is larger, whereas when negative, the volume is smaller when compared to the reference after the deformation.

Section 2.5 (d)); (ii) T1-weighted intensities after undergoing a standardization process [54] ; and (iii) grey matter (GM) probability maps, obtained via a tissue classification algorithm performed on the scaled intensity images [55] .\nThe intensity standardization technique makes use of available reference image tissue masks (background, grey matter and white matter). After global linear registration of the subject's image to the reference, a piecewise linear mapping function is computed based on the intensity correspondences obtained for each tissue, thereby implicitly binding histogram matching to tissue correspondence (rather than only matching histograms, as is the case in a number of different techniques, e.g., [41] ). The following steps are performed for each tissue: (1) mask both subject and reference images; (2) compute and smooth the subject-reference joint intensity histogram; (3) find joint tissue maxima; (4) determine the intensity mapping function by interpolating linearly between maximum tissue positions; and (5) apply the mapping to the original linear-registered image (see Figure 2) .\nThe GM probability maps were obtained by feeding intensity images to a neural network classifier [56] , which provided fuzzy probability maps for each tissue class, from which we retained only the GM probability.\nWe visually inspected and compared all standardized images and GM probability maps for quality control."}, {"section_title": "Volumes of Interest.", "text": "Following the conclusions of Pelaez-Coca et al.

Our technique achieved a high level of performance for the discrimination of probable AD from CTRL, achieving 79% accuracy on a comparative, benchmarked cohort, and 78% in a nearly twice-larger dataset. These results are statistically comparable to the clinical diagnostic (as per McNemar's test) and thus support the use of machine-learning techniques such as ours as biomarkers of medial temporal lobe atrophy within expanded criteria for the diagnostic of probable AD, such as proposed by McKhann et al. [2] . The technique also reached a global accuracy of 62% for progression of MCI to probable AD within 1.5 years on average after baseline, also congruent with a clinical diagnostic. These results indicate that specific spatially covarying intensity and local volume difference patterns, representative of tissue composition and deformation at that instant in time hold discriminatory information related to future clinical status in MCI. As for the discrimination of MCI-P from MCI-NP, further improvements are required if MRI alone is to be used. It remains that the most probable course of action is to pair up MRI information with clinical/cognitive testing.\nWe explored in Figure 4 the spatial distribution of discriminating information for GM or determinant differences between CTRL versus AD (Figures 4(a) and 4(b) ) and CTRL versus MCI-P (Figures 4(c) and 4(d) ). The results show an expected distribution of atrophy around the hippocampal and ventricular areas, which follow the expected atrophy distribution demonstrated in prior neuropathological studies (e.g., Braak stages I-VI) [57] . Thus, these results lead us to conclude that the automated technique is able to track discriminant medial temporal lobe atrophy characteristics related to AD, and thus serve as an aid for said diagnostic in a clinical setting. As well, this can be thought of as a biomarker of interest for neurodegeneration in MCI due to AD, as recommended by Albert et al. [3] .\nA number of previous reports have explored the topic of MR-based classification and prediction [18, 19, 21, 22, [24] [25] [26] . Fewer authors have explored multimodal (e.g. MRI and FDG-PET [20, 27] ; MRI and SPECT [23] ) or multifactorial (e.g., MRI and CSF [58, 59] ). Some of the latter report higher discriminatory abilities when using multimodal information. However, further evidence is required for those studies, as on the one hand cohort sizes remain small (especially for multimodal studies), and on the other, the acquisition process becomes clinically expensive and demanding for the patients.\nOur results are in line with this previous literature but are best compared to studies using similar datasets. Therefore, the benchmarking study by Cuingnet et al. [18] is especially valuable. It should be pointed that their results show only four techniques out of 10 scoring accuracies above chance at the MCI-P versus NP discrimination task. The performance of our technique thus becomes positively validated."}, {"section_title": "Limitations.", "text": "A substantial limitation of this study and, so far for all studies based on the ADNI dataset, remains the lack of histopathological confirmation for AD cases and MCI progression. Even though the longitudinal followup duration was substantial, our results do not equate perfectly with predicting AD, as the clinical assessment is not inherently 100% accurate. The length of followup is also expected to bias the results as more MCI subjects are expected to progress to clinically probable AD.\nIt should also be noted that we used a reference image created from the ICBM project. The choice of a reference image has been shown for other techniques to have a significant outcome on final results. We have tested this hypothesis early on (results not shown) using various templates, including age-related templates and did not uncover appreciable differences for the discrimination tasks that we explored. However, this cannot be construed as a general rule, since the choice of template may influence other discrimination tasks and should therefore be verified each time.\nFinally, albeit the ADNI dataset is large, we must use machine-learning approaches to optimize training/testing, and -fold validation is one such well-known method. The unavoidable downside to this approach is that slightly different information is collected for each fold. Thus, in a strict statistical sense, it is likely that the results are an overestimation of the classification rate on generalized data.\nOur results indicate that our completely automated technique is able to extract critical individualized diagnostic information from standardized MRI acquisitions, obtainable in a clinical setting."}, {"section_title": "Abbreviations", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "AD:", "text": "Alzheimer's disease ADNI: Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative aMCI:\nAmnestic MCI CTRL:\nControl subjects GM:\nGrey matter MCI:\nMild cognitive impairment MRI:\nMagnetic resonance imaging MTA:\nMedial temporal lobe atrophy MCI-NP: MCI nonprogressors MCI-P: MCI progressors NPV:\nNegative predictive value PPV:\nPositive predictive value VOI:\nVolume of interest.
