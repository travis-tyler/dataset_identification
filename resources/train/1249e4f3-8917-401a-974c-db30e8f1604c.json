[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Several retrospective epidemiological studies report that utilization of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR) inhibitors called statins at mid-life can reduce the risk of developing sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) by as much as 70%. Conversely, the administration of these inhibitors in clinically diagnosed subjects with AD confers little or no benefits over time. Here, we investigated the association between AD and HMGCR rs3846662, a polymorphism known to be involved in the regulation of HMGCR exon 13 skipping, in a founder population and in two distinct mixed North American populations of converting mild cognitively impaired (MCI) subjects (Alzheimer's disease Cooperative study (ADCS) and Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohorts). Targeting more specifically women, the G allele negative (G \u2212 ) AD subjects exhibit delayed age of onset of AD (P = 0.017) and significantly reduced risk of AD (OR: 0.521; P = 0.0028), matching the effect size reported by the apolipoprotein E type 2 variant. Stratification for APOE4 in a large sample of MCI patients from the ADCS cohort revealed a significant protective effect of G negative carriers on AD conversion 3 years after MCI diagnosis (odds ratio (OR): 0.554; P = 0.041). Conversion rate among APOE4 carriers with the HMGCR's G negative allele was markedly reduced (from 76% to 27%) to levels similar to APOE4 non-carriers (27.14%), which strongly indicate protection. Conversion data from the independent ADNI cohort also showed significantly reduced MCI or AD conversion among APOE4 carriers with the protective A allele (P = 0.005).

It is the commonest cause of dementia and represents the fourth most common cause of death in the developed world. 1 The two most famous pathological features of AD are the extracellular senile plaques, primarily composed of A\u03b2 peptides and the intracellular neurofibrillary tangles, resulting from the truncation and/or hyperphosphorylation of the microtubule-stabilizing Tau proteins (reviewed in Adlard and Cummings 2 ). In recent years, patients diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a transitional stage between normal ageing and AD, 3, 4 received overwhelming attention from the AD scientific community. It is estimated from previous research that nearly 80% of amnesic MCI patients, the dominant MCI subtype with a primary memory component, 5 will have converted to AD within the course of 6 years 6 at an annual conversion rate of 10-15%. 7 Given the absence of curative treatment, elucidation of factors affecting conversion of MCI to AD represents one of the most challenging and urgent medical mysteries affecting our ageing population.\nAbout 5% of all AD cases show an autosomal dominant inheritance, 8 whereas a greater challenge lies in discovering the causes of the more common form of AD -dubbed sporadic AD. Indeed, the concordance rate of AD among identical twins was shown to vary from 60-72%, 9, 10 highlighting the existence of interplay between genetic, environmental and health factors."}, {"section_title": "11", "text": "Apolipoprotein E (APOE) encodes the main lipid carrier protein in the central nervous system and is the most robustly and consistently associated gene with AD risk, with the \u03b54 (referred to here as APOE4) and \u03b52 (referred to here as APOE2) alleles substantially increasing and decreasing the risk level, respectively. [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] The APOE4 allele is also known to increase the likelihood of cognitive impairments in clinically normal 50+ years old over time 18 and to precipitate conversion to AD among MCI patients. 5 Despite being present in about 50% of AD cases, the APOE4 allele is neither necessary nor sufficient for the development of AD. 12, 14, 15 The search for the identification of additional genes contributing to AD led to the identification of 695 candidate genes 19 of which a surprising number are directly involved in lipid metabolism at the level of transport, synthesis, storage and internalization of lipoproteins. 20 These include BIN1, 21 PICALM,"}, {"section_title": "22", "text": "ABCA7 21 and CLU. 22, 23 Although the genetic heterogeneity of these large genome-wide association studies have an increased power to detect risk genes with smaller effect sizes, populationrelevant signal will likely go undetected. 24 The use of isolated populations with a few founders, such as the French Canadians of Quebec, 25 reduces the genetic background noise and allows the detection of population-specific signals. 24 Moreover, targeted testing of polymorphisms known to strongly associate with altered transcript levels may be a powerful way to identify genetic associations with diseases that would otherwise be difficult to detect. 26 Here, we evaluate a functional polymorphism (rs3846662) in 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR) for association with AD in an isolated population, the Quebec founder population (QFP), 25 and corroborate our findings in two other well-characterized cohorts: the Alzheimer's disease Cooperative study (ADCS) 3 and the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohorts. 27 HMGCR is a strong functional AD candidate gene because it encodes the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase enzyme, which serves as the rate-limiting step in cholesterol synthesis in all mammalian cells. Cholesterol requirement of most brain cells are met by two separate yet interrelated processes: synthesis by HMGCR and internalization of lipoproteins via the APOE/lowdensity lipoprotein receptor cascade, 28, 29 which is compromised in AD. Alterations in lipid homeostasis are known to severely impair neuronal function and elicit neurodegenerative disorders such as Niemann-Pick type C disease, a fatal cholesterol storage disorder characterized by the presence of AD-like intracellular neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. 30 Elevated plasma cholesterol levels are known among vascular risk factors of AD. 31, 32 Although not a universal finding, the treatment of hypercholesterolemia with HMGCR inhibitors (statins) in middle-aged individuals confers some level of neuroprotection against late-life development of AD. [33] [34] [35] [36] In addition, statin treatment was shown to reduce the cerebrospinal fluid phospho-Tau content. 37 This finding is consistent with the quasi-absence of cortical intracellular neurofibrillary tangles in autopsy-confirmed cognitively intact subjects who have used statins for several years as opposed to non-users. 38 Furthermore, whole-genome scans of late-onset AD cases reported the presence of several linkage hot spots across the genome, including one in the vicinity of the HMGCR gene on chromosome 5.\n19,39 Accordingly, two recent studies found an association between HMGCR gene locus and AD. 40, 41 One of HMGCR's most important co-regulator of cholesterol synthesis, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase, 42 was also shown to be significantly associated with sporadic AD in stratified populations enriched in APOE4-negative subjects, pointing toward a possible cholesterol metabolism dysfunction in AD subjects born without the APOE4 allele risk factor.\nOverall, studies provide evidences of an association between HMGCR and AD, but this association is not compelling because none of the 21 genome-wide association studies performed to date substantiated HMGCR as a susceptibility gene for AD (current as of 31 January 2014: http://www.alzgene.org/largescale.asp). Interestingly, HMGCR undergoes alternative splicing of exon 13, which encodes a part of the catalytic domain of the enzyme. Two independent group reported the involvement of the intron 13 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs3846662 in the regulation of HMGCR exon 13 skipping 43, 44 by altering the binding motif of a molecule that regulates HMGCR alternative splicing: heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1. 45 As the \u039413 transcript could not rescue HMGCR activity in UT2 HMGCR-deficient cells upon transfection, 44 it has been associated with lower levels of plasma low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol 46 and is one of the single most informative molecular marker of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol response to statins. 43, 47, 48 The rs3846662 represented the ideal functional polymorphism to study in our three cohorts study. The rs3846662 is even more important to study in the context of AD and MCI given our original preliminary report of the presence of multiple genetic risk factors in the HMGCR gene and their impacts on AD pathology in a small cohort of autopsyconfirmed cases. 49 "}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "QFP (cohort 1): HMGCR gene in controls and AD cases", "text": "Human Subjects Demographics. Patients demographic characteristics are summarized in Table 1 . Definite diagnosis of AD was based on the histopathological confirmation of AD according to NINCDS-ADRDA criteria, 50 whereas controls had to be free of neurological or psychiatric diseases and, for autopsy-confirmed cases, of brain structural lesions (tangle and plaque indices reading o20 mm 3 and o10 mm 2 , respectively). All subjects are from the so-called QFP (French Canadians of Quebec). This population (age-matched controls: N = 250/autopsy-confirmed AD cases: N = 324) descended in genetic isolation from several thousand founders who emigrated from France in the 17th century. 25 The demographic history of the QFP, which is characterized by population bottleneck, rapid population expansion and little admixture, makes it a valuable resource for use in genetic studies. 51 The population has been well characterized as having reduced genetic heterogeneity for Mendelian AD and HMGCR: a three cohorts study V Leduc et al diseases. 52 Age at death, age at recruitment and education are not significantly different between controls and autopsy-confirmed AD subjects.

The relatively homogeneous environmental exposures and reduced genetic heterogeneity associated with this population 25,51,52 were likely to be advantageous for the study of AD, a disease resulting from the genetic and environmental interplay. The use of autopsyconfirmed cases allowed us to further reduce the false-positive background noise normally seen in clinical diagnosis. This preliminary study failed to reveal any disease-specific genetic mutations in all 20 exons. A rare polymorphism in exon 15 was detected but did not differ in terms of group incidence between AD and age-matched control subjects. Mapping of the introns, on the other hand, turned out to be more interesting as the rs3846662 SNP in intron 13 of the HMGCR gene (A or G allele) was found to significantly associate with sporadic AD. Table 1 summarizes the frequency distribution obtained in our QFP cohort that included 250 controls and 324 AD cases. The association between HMGCR's intron 13 G negative polymorphism (AA) and sporadic AD was found to be significant (OR = 0.694; P = 0.024; Table 2 ). Stratification by gender revealed that this association is significant only in women (women: OR = 0.521; P = 0.0028; men: OR = 0.890; P = 0.686) as is the case for the wellknown APOE2 allele benefit (women: OR = 0.316, P o 0.001; men: OR = 0.679; P = 0.293) in the same group of subjects ( Table 2) .\nAnalyses of the impact of the HMGCR polymorphism on age of onset in AD is summarized in Figure 1 .

This age effect in G negative subjects was not found in men (Wilcoxon survival test: \u03a7 2 1, 100 = 1.88; P = 0.170). Analysis of the 'A' variant dose effect on age of onset reveals a significant association (P o 0.03) in women, particularly between the age of 60 and 80 (Supplementary Materials).\nAs reported previously in several independent studies, 16,17 a very similar protective effect was observed with the APOE2 allele (Wilcoxon survival test: \u03a7 In summary, studies performed in our autopsied-confirmed QFP subjects uncovered a protective association between HMGCR's G negative genotype, AD risk and age of onset, particularly in women. The question was then to decipher whether or not the A allele could modulate the APOE4 risk in patients not affected by full-blown AD, such as in MCI patients.\nIn a follow-up study, a total of 409 MCI patients from the original Petersen et al., 3 MCI conversion trial (ADCS) were thus genotyped for APOE and HMGCR polymorphisms. Table 1 summarizes the frequency distribution obtained in MCI patients from the 3 years ADCS study that included 271 non-converters and 138 converters to AD. Conversion was determined by an expert panel from the ADCS study (refer to Petersen et al. 3 for more details). Associations between intron 13 A allele and AD conversion were not found to be significant (OR = 0.726; P = 0.129, Table 3 ). However, APOE4 genotype stratification revealed a significant protective effect in G negative carriers on AD conversion among APOE4-positive MCI patients (OR = 0.554; P = 0.041, Table 3 ). Interestingly, the conversion rate among APOE4/HMGCR's G negative subjects was markedly reduced (from 76-26.97% conversion to AD) to levels similar to APOE4 non-carriers (27.14% conversion to AD) at 3 years' post-MCI diagnosis. This suggests that the HMGCR gene variant can markedly attenuate APOE4 risk, especially in the pre-dementia stages of the disease.\nTo extend and replicate the conversion dataset in the ADCS cohort, we decided to examine the conversion rate from normal controls/MCI/AD to MCI/AD in the ADNI cohort as a function of HMGCR's G allele (positive vs negative) status and APOE stratification. To this end, we used genotyping data from ADNI that included 1233 individuals who were followed over a period of 48 months for conversion to MCI or AD. Table 1 summarizes the frequency distribution obtained in this mix population of cognitively intact, MCI and AD subjects that included 935 nonconverters and 298 converters. Consistent with the abovementioned ADCS' findings, associations between G negative status and MCI/AD conversion were not found to be significant (OR = 1.019; P = 0.908). However, the G negative polymorphism exerted a very significant protective effect specific to APOE4 Abbreviations: AD, Alzheimer's disease; HMGCR, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase; HMGCR-G \u2212 , G negative versus G positive genotype; N, sample size; OR, odds ratio.

Analysis of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles densities in a cohort of 118 autopsied AD cases derived from our eastern Canadian population isolate reveals that the reported apoE4-mediated increases in hippocampal and cortical plaques and tangles density in AD is actually prevented in G negative carriers as opposed to G positive subjects (Supplementary Materials), consistent with the protective role of G negative polymorphism on age of onset and conversion rate. As initially hypothesized, these confirmatory results clearly indicate that APOE and HMGCR genes are interdependently modulating the conversion to MCI or AD among an at-risk cognitively intact or MCI population."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "The association between sporadic AD and the HMGCR's rs3846662 G negative status in this three cohorts study clearly identify the HMGCR gene as one of the most important and common protective variant ever identified for sporadic AD, second only to APOE2. It provides us with a novel lead explanation as for the discrepancies between retrospective and prospective studies dealing with the potential benefit of statins in sporadic AD. Indeed, several retrospective cross-sectional observational studies have shown that statins can reduce by up to 70% the risk of developing AD. 33, 35 However, results of prospective studies have been inconsistent, [54] [55] [56] and recent double blind placebocontrolled clinical trials in mild-to-moderate AD using simvastatin and atorvastatin for at least 6 months failed to show disease stabilization or improvement, 57, 58 mostly due to a marked treatment response heterogeneity. This suggests that for statins to reduce risk, it must be taken during a certain critical period and for a certain length of time, preferably years before the expected onset of the disease. Corroborating this conclusion, the protective HMGCR's G negative polymorphism was shown to modulate APOE4 risk in cognitively intact and MCI subjects and, to delay age of onset of AD by 3.6 years. These findings are consistent, at least in part, with a recent small case-control study that reported an interaction between the rs3761740 A allele in the promoter region of the HMGCR gene, the APOE E4 allele and an altered risk of AD (OR = 2.41; 95% confidence interval = 0.93-6.22). 59 Analysis of the allelic distribution of this promoter variant and the rs3846662 SNP examined in the present study reveals a potent linkage disequilibrium (probability: 0.97) between the two variants in our population isolate from eastern Canada, which could very well explain the complementary nature of findings reported by the two research teams (data not shown).\nWhether the protective effect of statins on AD risk is mediated through reduction of vascular risk factors or through the direct modulation of central nervous system cholesterol homeostasis remains to be clarify. Interestingly, Wolozin et al. 36 reported that statins neuroprotective properties sharply differed as a function of lipids solubility, an observation recently replicated in a secondary analysis of the 'preventive' Ginkgo Evaluation of Memory Study. 60 These studies found that the more lipidsoluble (that is, simvastatin) HMGCR inhibitors exhibited high protective effects as opposed to the more lipophobic and less likely to cross the blood-brain barrier statins (that is, atorvastatin), which exhibited little to no protective effect. These observations would thus favor the hypothesis that statin mediates its neuroprotective effect through direct modulation of central nervous system cholesterol homeostasis. Unfortunately, none of the statin studies examined the contribution of the genetic polymorphisms of HMGCR and APOE on the extent of the protective effect.\nCombined with the results of the genome-wide screening on chromosome 5 (refs 19,39) our findings clearly point toward a potential role of the HMGCR in the etiopathology of AD. Our study indicates that carriers of the intron 13 rs3846662 variant display a protective effect that resemble in size and gender to what has been reported for APOE2 in humans. The similarity between the genetic association of APOE, the brain's most important cholesterol transporter, and HMGCR, the ratelimiting step in cholesterol synthesis in the brain, is revealing to be quite interesting. On one hand, APOE4 is a risk factor that precipitates age of onset, markedly so in women, whereas the APOE2 variant as well as the HMGCR's G negative polymorphism both delay age of onset of AD, more so, in women. Furthermore, APOE is perceived by lipid neurobiologists as a key extracellular lipid transport protein, whereas HMGCR, which is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, is primarily an intracellular, organellespecific protein that regulates intracellular lipid production. It is thus quite conceivable that these two proteins actually have complementary roles in the maintenance of local brain cholesterol homeostasis, particularly in presence of neurodegeneration or damage.\nIn conclusion, this three cohorts study provides strong evidence that HMGCR is a genetic modifier for risk, age of onset and MCI conversion to AD. Converging evidence have now confirmed the involvement of rs3846662 SNP in HMGCR exon 13 skipping in peripheral cells in vivo, the A allele being associated with an increased in exon 13 skipping. 44 As reflected by its association with decreased low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels, 46 the rs3846662 A allele is associated with decreased HMGCR activity. This finding is in accordance with the blunted response to statin therapy observed in G negative (or AA allele) carriers. 43, 47, 48 Given that these findings were obtained mostly in the periphery, whether the rs3846662 is as important for the central nervous system needs to be substantiated. Studies addressing if the rs3846662 modulates mRNA splicing, protein HMGCR levels and activity in the human brain are currently underway in autopsied human brains."}]
