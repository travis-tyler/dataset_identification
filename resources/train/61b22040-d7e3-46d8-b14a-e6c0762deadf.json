[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "This study examines the relationship between precipitation and radiative heating on intraseasonal time scales in the Tropics using collocated top-of-atmosphere (TOA) and surface radiative flux measurements from special field program data [Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program and Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Response Experiment (TOGA COARE) experiments] as well as long-term TOA flux data [from Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) and Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) satellite data]. All the different datasets consistently show that the atmosphere-integrated radiative heating is nearly in phase with the precipitation and enhances the net condensation heating by about 10%-15%. The dominant contribution to this radiative warming during wet periods is the reduction of TOA outgoing longwave radiation (OLR), primarily by clouds but with a small contribution by water vapor. This radiative heating is reduced slightly by enhanced surface downwelling longwave radiation, attributable to low cloud bases and reduced atmospheric shortwave absorption attributable to shadowing by high cloud tops.\nThe intraseasonal budget of TOA radiation, reflecting heating of the whole ocean plus atmosphere column, is characterized by shortwave cloud forcing anomalies that are substantially larger than the longwave cloud forcing anomaly. This imbalance is in contrast with the near cancellation between these two terms at the seasonal time scale."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The tropical intraseasonal oscillation (ISO), discovered by Madden and Julian (1971, 1972) , is an important mode of tropical convection and circulation (e.g., Weickmann et al. 1985; Lau and Chan 1985; Salby and Hendon 1994; Wheeler and Kiladis 1999) . It affects a wide range of tropical and extratropical weather (e.g., Yasunari 1979; Hendon and Liebmann 1990; Liebmann et al. 1994; Higgins and Mo 1997) and the onset and decay of some of the El Ni\u00f1o events (e.g., Kessler et al. 1995; Takayabu et al. 1999; Bergman et al. 2001) . Therefore, the ISO is important for both extended-range weather forecasting and long-term climate prediction.\nTropical intraseasonal variability is poorly simulated in general circulation models (GCMs). Typically, simulated phenomena are too weak and propagate too fast (e.g., Hayashi and Sumi 1986; Hayashi and Golder 1986, 1988; Lau et al. 1988; Slingo et al. 1996) . It is our hope that observational studies of major budget terms may offer useful guidance on how to improve ISO simulations and forecasts in models.\nDiabatic heating is crucial to the ISO in the Eastern Hemisphere (Krishnamurti et al. 1985; Murakami and Nakazawa 1985; Yanai et al. 2000) . The heating is strongly associated with a propagating large-scale circulation anomaly (e.g., Madden and Julian 1972; Weickmann et al. 1985; Salby and Hendon 1994) , and this propagating circulation anomaly (hereafter called a wave) also feeds back onto the heating Zhang 1996) , suggesting a wave-heating feedback theoretical framework for the ISO. The total diabatic heating has two main components: convective heating (release of latent heat, along with eddy flux divergences that shape the profile) and radiative heating. Most theoretical studies have focused only on the role of convective heating in wave-heating feedback. The mechanisms studied include the wave-CISK (conditional instability of the second kind) mechanism (e.g., Lau and Peng 1987) , the wind-induced surface heat exchange (WISHE) mechanism (e.g., Emanuel 1987; Neelin et al. 1987) , and the charge-discharge mechanism (e.g., Blade and Hartmann 1993; Hayashi and Golder 1997) .\nRecently, several modeling studies found that radiative heating can also significantly affect the amplitude and/or phase speed of the simulated intraseasonal oscillations (Raymond 2001; Lee et al. 2001; Sobel and Gildor 2003) . In the convectively active phase of the ISO, clouds and water vapor associated with deep convection reduce outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) to space and therefore increase radiative heating in the L I N A N D M A P E S atmosphere, which tends to reinforce the preexisting convective heating. As a quantitative measure, an enhancement factor of radiative heating can be defined as the ratio between the column-integrated radiative heating and the column-integrated convective heating. In an idealized model of thermodynamic atmosphere-ocean interaction on the intraseasonal time scale, Sobel and Gildor (2003) found that the enhancement factor of radiative heating is the most sensitive parameter, and both the growth rate and the period of simulated intraseasonal oscillations increase with the enhancement factor. In a set of atmospheric GCM simulations of the ISO, Lee et al. (2001) found that the amplitude, phase speed, and even direction of propagation of intraseasonal variability are very sensitive to the enhancement factor of radiative heating, which can be varied, for example, by changing cloud microphysical assumptions. In a theoretical model, Raymond (2001) demonstrated that when the enhancement factor is very large the radiative heating can reduce the effective static stability to a negative value, that is, to an effective static instability. He termed this instability the radiative-convective instability. An ISO-like slow eastward-propagating mode appears to develop in his model from this radiative-convective instability. In order to reach such radiative-convective instability, the enhancement factor of radiative heating may need to be larger than 20%, as estimated by Lee et al. (2001) based on the vertical structure assumptions of Yu et al. (1998) .\nThe high sensitivity of the preceding ISO models to the enhancement factor of radiative heating raises the following questions for observation. What is the observed value of enhancement factor in the ISO? Does it reach the critical value of 20% for radiative-convective instability? Is the radiative heating well in phase with the convective heating, or is there a phase lag between them? Apart from the OLR, do other terms (such as surface downwelling longwave flux or atmospheric shortwave absorption) also contribute importantly to the anomalous radiative heating?\nMost previous observational studies of the earth's radiation budget using satellite data focused on climatological mean patterns and seasonal-to-interannual variations (e.g., Vonder Haar and Suomi 1969; Cess 1976; Ramanathan et al. 1989; Harrison et al. 1990; Cess et al. 2001) . Most previous observational studies of the atmospheric radiation budget using collocated satellitesurface data also focused on climatological mean values (e.g., Cess et al. 1995 Cess et al. , 1996 Collins et al. 1996; Chou et al. 1998) . Few studies have been done on the timevarying radiation budget associated with perturbations around the seasonal mean. Johnson and Ciesielski (2000) derive indirectly the column-integrated radiative heating from the sounding array budget during Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Response Experiment (TOGA COARE) and found a very strong intraseasonal variation. However, after the humidity bias in the original sounding data was corrected, they recalculated the column-integrated radiative heating and found a much smaller intraseasonal variation (Ciesielski et al. 2002; see Fig. 8b below) . Therefore, it is still unclear how much the column-integrated radiative heating enhances the column-integrated convective heating in the ISO.\nIn this study, we derive intraseasonal variations in the radiation budget directly from collocated top-of-atmosphere (TOA) and surface radiative flux measurements. Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program and TOGA COARE experiments provide intensive special datasets, while long-term TOA flux measurements from the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) and Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) offer larger statistical samples. Indirect budget-residual estimates from COARE are also compared.\nThe datasets used in this study are described in section 2. The time filtering and intraseasonal composite (regression) methods are described in section 3. The radiation budget results are reported in section 4, divided into atmospheric (section 4a), TOA (section 4b), and surface (section 4c). A summary is given in section 5."}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "The datasets used in this study are summarized in Table 1 . The radiation datasets used include collocated TOA and surface radiative fluxes from ARM and TOGA COARE, column-integrated radiative heating derived indirectly from TOGA COARE sounding array budgets, and long-term TOA fluxes from ERBE and AVHRR. For comparison with column-integrated convective heating, corresponding precipitation data have also been used. To bracket the uncertainties associated with precipitation measurements/estimates, multiple precipitation datasets are used when available. The following subsections detail the datasets from ARM (2a) and COARE (2b), with point-sampling issues considered in section 2c.

Collocated TOA and surface fluxes for ARM", "text": "The collocated TOA and surface fluxes for the ARM tropical western Pacific (TWP) Manus site (Fig. 3a) include TOA fluxes from Geostationary Meteorological Satellite (GMS; Minnis et al. 1995; Doelling et al. 1998) and surface downwelling fluxes from Clouds and Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) ARM Validation Experiment (CAVE; Rutan et al. 2001) , which covers a 14-month period from April 2000 to May 2001. The Manus site is located at 2\u040aS, 147\u040aE with an elevation of 6 m.\nThe GMS TOA fluxes (Minnis et al. 1995; Doelling et al. 1998 ) include broadband shortwave (SW) albedo and longwave (LW) flux, which are converted from the GMS narrowband measurements using narrowbandbroadband relationships derived from historical collo- (1991) Spencer ( cated GMS and ERBE measurements. The data cover a 0.3\u040a \u03eb 0.3\u040a area surrounding Manus Island with a temporal resolution of 1 h. The missing values are filled with linear interpolation in time allowing no more than two consecutive missing hours. The upwelling SW flux is then calculated from the albedo and the downward TOA SW flux (computed from the solar constant and solar zenith angle). The hourly data are averaged into daily data only when the number of missing hours is no more than two for the SW flux. Otherwise, the daily value is assigned missing. The daily data are then averaged to pentad data.\nTo validate the GMS TOA fluxes, we use the collocated CERES broadband measurements (Wielicki et al. 1996) stored in the CAVE archive. The CERES data are twice daily and do not sample a full diurnal cycle, so they could not be used directly. Figure 1 shows the comparison of hourly GMS fluxes with available CE-RES measurements within the same hour averaged over a 30 km \u03eb 30 km area surrounding the Manus site. Both the GMS LW and SW fluxes correlate well with the corresponding CERES measurements. The LW flux has a small negative bias (7%). This bias, when reflected in the intraseasonal anomaly (see Fig. 10 below), is only 1-2 W m \u03ea2 , which would not affect our conclusions. The SW flux is not biased, although it is more scattered than the LW flux.\nThe GMS TOA fluxes have also clear-sky values, making it possible to calculate the cloud radiative forcing (CRF). The LW CRF at TOA is defined as\nwhere F is the all-sky upwelling LW flux at TOA, and F clr is the clear-sky upwelling LW flux at TOA. The SW CRF is defined as\nwhere R is the all-sky upwelling (reflected) SW flux at TOA, and R clr is the clear-sky upwelling SW flux at TOA.\nThe surface radiative fluxes were measured by the Atmospheric Radiation and Cloud Stations (ARCS; Mather et al. 1998) . Variables used include downwelling global SW flux and shaded downwelling LW flux. The temporal resolution is 60 s. The ARCS surface fluxes are averaged to hourly data. There are a few missing values and they are filled using linear interpolation in time. The hourly data are then averaged to daily data, and the daily data are further averaged to pentad data. The surface upwelling SW flux is calculated from downwelling SW flux by taking the surface SW albedo as 0.055 following Weller and Anderson (1996) and Burks (1998) . The surface upwelling LW flux is also calculated following Weller and Anderson (1996) using LW up \u03ed \u2440 ss \u03ea (1 \u03ea \u2440 ss )LW dn , where T S is the sea surface 4 T S temperature, is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and \u2440 ss is the longwave emissivity of the sea surface taken as 0.97. A graybody approximation is used so that the surface longwave albedo is equal to one minus the emissivity. The sea surface temperature comes from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature data (Reynolds et al. 2002) .\nThe surface precipitation for ARM comes from Climate Prediction Center (CPC) Merged Precipitation Analysis (CMAP; Xie and Arkin 1997). The CMAP data are pentad data with a horizontal resolution of 2.5\u040a latitude by 2.5\u040a longitude. We average the four grids surrounding Manus Island.\nCloud information comes from GMS geostationary satellite data (Minnis et al. 1995; Doelling et al. 1998) . In this study, we use the total cloud amount, averaged cloud-top height, and averaged cloud optical depth for the 0.3\u040a \u03eb 0.3\u040a area surrounding Manus Island. Profiles of atmosphere temperature and water vapor mixing ratio come from the upper-air soundings at Manus Island."}, {"section_title": "b.

The TOA fluxes come from the GMS satellite data similar as above but processed for TOGA COARE (Minnis et al. 1995; Doelling et al. 1998 ). The surface fluxes are averages of measurements at five surface stations. The datasets are 3-hourly and are averaged to daily data.\nWe also use the column-integrated radiative heating derived indirectly from the TOGA COARE IFA sounding array budget by Ciesielski et al. (2002) . The data are 6-hourly and are averaged to daily data.\nThe surface precipitation for TOGA COARE IFA comes from three different estimates: the 3-hourly Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) visible (VIS)-IR precipitation (Curry et al. 1999) , the daily Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) precipitation (Spencer 1993) , and 6-hourly sounding array budget precipitation (Ciesielski et al. 2002) . All the datasets are averaged to daily data. The cloud information for TOGA COARE comes from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP; Rossow and Garder 1993) .

Sampling issues for collocated TOA and surface measurements", "text": "A significant source of error in collocated satellitesurface measurements are sampling errors (Cess et al. 1996) , which occur because the satellite pixel measurements are instantaneous and over a grid that is much larger than the field of view of an upward-facing pyranometer or pyrgeometer. A single isolated cloud could substantially impact the surface measurement while having little effect on the satellite measurement; the reverse would occur if there were clouds over most of the satellite grid but not over the surface instrument. Cloud systems move, however, so that, in a statistical context, temporally averaging the surface measurements can be equivalent to spatially averaging them over the satellite grid. This equivalence between temporal and spatial averaging has been demonstrated by Long and Ackerman (1995) and Cess et al. (1996) using collocated satellitepyranometer measurements for a region in Wisconsin. Cess et al. (1996) show that 60-min temporal averaging at one station can represent well the spatial averaging over a network of stations covering a roughly 0.8\u040a \u03eb 0.8\u040a grid. Long and Ackerman (1995) show that for any pair of stations the correlation between temporal averages at the two locations increases monotonically with averaging period, and reaches nearly 1 (perfect correlation) for daily average. In this study, all the collocated satellite-surface measurements are temporally averaged over a period longer than 1 day, and are further filtered using a 30-70-day bandpass filter (section 3). Therefore, the sampling error should be very small and would not affect our results in any substantial manner."}, {"section_title": "d.

All the long-term gridded datasets cover 5 yr from 1985 to 1989 except for the GPI precipitation, which starts from 1986. All the datasets have a horizontal resolution of 2.5\u040a latitude by 2.5\u040a longitude. We average the data to pentad data along the equator (between 5\u040aN and 5\u040aS) with a zonal resolution of 10\u040a longitude."}, {"section_title": "Method", "text": "The ISO is a broadband phenomenon with an average period of 45 days and a spread from 20 to 80 days (see review by Madden and Julian 1994) . To emphasize the broadband nature of the oscillation, previous studies used wide-frequency bands such as 30-60 days (Weickmann et al. 1985) , 35-95 days , or 30-96 days (Wheeler and Kiladis 1999) . In this study we also use a wide-frequency band of 30-70 days. All datasets are filtered using a 30-70-day Murakami (1979) filter, whose response function is shown in Fig. 2 . The central frequency corresponds to a period of 45 days. The half-amplitude is at periods of 30 and 70 days. We have also tested the Lanczos filter (Duchan 1979) , and the results are not sensitive to the different choice of filters. Although the ISO has seasonality in its amplitude and characteristics, intraseasonal variability at the equator is observed year-round, so we use all available data throughout the year.\nFor the long-term data and ARM data, an ISO composite is constructed using linear regression with respect to an ISO index. In this study, we use the 30-70-day filtered CMAP precipitation at a box within 5\u040aN-5\u040aS, 145\u040a-150\u040aE (surrounding Manus Island) as our ISO index. The confidence level of linear correlation is estimated following Oort and Yienger (1996) . Figure 3a shows the lag regression between the ISO index and the CMAP precipitation for 23 yr of data. As has been shown by many previous observations (e.g., Weickmann et al. 1985; Lau and Chan 1985; Rui and Wang 1990; Hendon and Salby 1994) , the ISO consists of a precipitation anomaly that generally forms in the western Indian Ocean, amplifies to its first maximum in the eastern Indian Ocean, weakens over the Maritime period (Fig. 3b) looks similar to the long-term composite (Fig. 3a) . In particular, at the measurement longitude, the composite ISO propagates eastward with the typical phase speed of 5 m s \u03ea1 . For the TOGA COARE data, we focus on the December 1992 ISO event (Fig. 3c ). This is a strong ISO event with its amplitude at the TOGA COARE location larger than twice the standard deviation of the 23-yr data (Fig. 4) . It moves eastward with a phase speed of 5 m s \u03ea1 , which is similar to the phase speed of the 23-yr composite (Fig. 3a) . The maximum of the 30-70-day bandpass-filtered precipitation anomaly at the TOGA COARE IFA occurs on 21 December 1992."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "a. Intraseasonal variation of clouds and atmospheric properties", "text": "The variation of satellite-estimated total cloud during the composite ISO life cycle for ARM data is shown in Fig. 5 . During precipitation, total cloud fraction increases due to the strong increase of high cloud fraction (Fig.  5a ). Both middle and low cloud fraction appear to decrease, although this is likely an artifact of screening by high clouds. The averaged cloud-top height therefore increases (Fig. 5b) . The cloud optical depth also increases because the high cloud becomes optically thicker (Fig. 5c) . Figure 6 shows the associated variation of atmospheric properties as seen in sounding data. The vertically averaged temperature (Fig. 6a ) leads precipitation by 5 days, while the vertically averaged water vapor mixing ratio (Fig. 6b) is exactly in phase with precipitation. The TOGA COARE cloud and sounding data show similar results as the ARM data (not shown)."}, {"section_title": "b. Atmosphere radiation budget", "text": "The column-integrated diabatic heating can be written as (e.g., Yanai and Johnson 1993 )\nis the integration from the tropopause pressure p t to the surface pressure p s . Here, Q 1 is the diabatic heating, Q conv the convective heating, and Q R the radiative heating; L the latent heat of vaporization, P the surface precipitation, and S the surface sensible heat flux. In the Tropics, S is generally much smaller than LP, and the column-intregrated convective heating \u0357Q conv \u0358 \u0d20 LP. Figure 7 shows the anomalous LP\u0408 and \u0357Q R \u0358\u0408 during the composite ISO life cycle for 14 months of ARM data. Note that \u0357Q R \u0358\u0408 slightly lags after LP\u0408 (by less than 5 days), and its amplitude is 11% of that of LP\u0408. Figure  8 is the same as Fig. 7 except for the December 1992 ISO event during TOGA COARE. Again \u0357Q R \u0358\u0408 from TOA and surface flux measurements slightly lags after LP\u0408 by 1-2 days, and its amplitude is 16% of that of LP\u0408, which is larger than the ARM result. The reason that it is larger may be that it is for one ISO event, while the ARM result is for the composite of many ISOs. The estimate of \u0357Q R \u0358\u0408 derived from sounding array budgets has a much larger amplitude, 25% of that of LP\u0408. The residual method for deriving \u0357Q R \u0358 from sounding array budgets is limited by the errors in all other terms of the column-integrated moist static energy budget, such as the measurements of upper-air wind, temperature and humidity, and calculation of their gradients, plus errors in measurements of surface latent and sen- sible heat fluxes (Zhang and Lin 1997) . Mapes et al. (2003) estimated that the random sampling error of IFA budget-derived \u0357Q R \u0358 is about 10 W m \u03ea2 for monthly mean, and 20 W m \u03ea2 for 5-day mean, which is close to its amplitude of the ISO variation (see Fig. 8b ). Therefore, the budget-derived estimate is not accurate enough to pose a significant inconsistency with the 10%-15% values based on TOA and surface radiative flux data from ARM and COARE."}, {"section_title": "VOLUME 61 J O U R N A L O F T H E A T M O S P H E R I C S C I E", "text": "The \u0357Q R \u0358\u0408 anomaly is dominated by the LW component as seen in Fig. 9 . The dominant terms in the LW budget are shown in Fig. 10 for ARM and TOGA COARE data, with similar results. The dominant term is the TOA OLR (dotted line in Fig. 10 ), which slightly lags after the precipitation. Because the clear-sky OLR anomaly is small (Fig. 11) , this reduced emission is caused primarily by increased high cloud amount (Figs.  5a,b) , with a lesser contribution by increased atmospheric water vapor (Fig. 6b) during precipitation. The fact that clear-sky OLR decreases in the active phase (Fig. 11) indicates that the increased water vapor (Fig.  6b) is more important than the increased temperature (Fig. 6c) . The ''clear-sky greenhouse trapping'' [defined by Raval and Ramanathan (1989) as the difference between the clear-sky OLR and the surface upwelling LW flux] increases by about 2 W m \u03ea2 (Fig. 11) per standard deviation of precipitation (110 W m \u03ea2 ). The surface downwelling LW flux (dashed line in Fig.  10 ) also shows an appreciable anomaly, out of phase with the precipitation, when increased clouds emit radiation from their bases down to the surface. The surface upwelling LW flux (dash-dotted line in Fig. 10) shows a small anomaly caused by the SST variation, which leads the precipitation by a quarter cycle (e.g., Zhang 1996; Hendon and Glick 1997) . Because the surface downwelling LW flux anomaly cools the atmosphere column at the time of maximum precipitation, the LW atmospheric heating anomaly is always smaller than the OLR anomaly. Therefore, the OLR anomaly provides an upper limit for the LW heating anomaly and, in turn, for the total \u0357Q R \u0358\u0408anomaly because the SW heating anomaly is also slight cooling during the time of maximum precipitation. This makes it very convenient to estimate the upper limit (about 20% too large, based on these results) of \u0357Q R \u0358\u0408 anomaly using the existing longterm OLR data from ERBE and AVHRR.\nThe SW component is smaller, contributing a slight cooling at the time of maximum precipitation, when there is increased high cloud amount (Fig. 5) . Radiative transfer calculation showed that high clouds reduce the atmospheric shortwave absorption (Chen et al. 2000) , although some uncertainties exist for the SW models in general (e.g., Cess et al. 1995 Cess et al. , 1996 . Our observational data cannot separate the cloud effect from the clear-sky effect because we do not have the clear-sky fluxes at the surface, which are very difficult to isolate even for the seasonal mean (e.g., Waliser et al. 1996; Chou and Zhao 1997) , let alone at the intraseasonal time scale. Figure 12 shows regressions against filtered CMAP of (Fig. 12a ) the precipitation anomaly and (Fig. 12b ) the OLR anomalies from ERBE (solid line) and AVHRR (dashed line) during the composite ISO life cycle at 0\u040a, 155\u040aE for 1985-89. The different precipitation datasets have some difference, with CMAP and GPI larger than MSU. The ERBE and AVHRR OLR data are remarkably consistent. The OLR anomaly is about 13% of the LP\u0408 anomaly when using CMAP or GPI precipitation, and 15% when using MSU precipitation. This upper limit of 15% for the relative \u0357Q R \u0358\u0408 anomaly agrees with the ARM and TOGA COARE results (Figs. 7, 8) . Figure 13 shows the magnitudes of intraseasonal variations regressed against filtered CMAP at each longitude along the equator. Again, precipitation estimates by CMAP and GPI are systematically larger than MSU, but the ERBE and AVHRR OLR data are quite consistent. In the Indo-Pacific warm pool region (80\u040aE-180\u040a), the ratio between OLR\u0408 and LP\u0408 is less than 15% when using CMAP or GPI precipitation, and slightly larger than 15% when using MSU precipitation, which is consistent with 10%-15% from shorter-term single-longitude results from ARM and TOGA COARE. In summary, all the different datasets consistently show that on intraseasonal time scales, column-integrated radiative heating lags the column-integrated convective heating by less than 5 days, and in the warm pool region it enhances the convective heating by about 10%-15%. To put this in perspective, recall that based on the vertical structure assumption of Yu et al. (1998) , Lee et al. (2001) estimated that in order for the tropical atmosphere to reach radiative-convective instability, the enhancement factor of radiative heating needs to be larger than 20%.\nIt is interesting to note in Fig. 13 that the ratio between the OLR anomaly and LP\u0408 is much larger (over 20%) in the western Indian Ocean, which is the for- mation region for the ISO (e.g., Rui and Wang 1990; Hendon and Salby 1994) . This suggests that radiativeconvective instability may play a role in the formation of the ISO, as proposed by Raymond (2001) . Scatterplots of precipitation versus OLR anomalies in this region (not shown) indicate that OLR has a large intraseasonal oscillation, while precipitation only has a very small oscillation. Although not associated with precipitation, cloud radiative effects may still ''pump'' the water vapor into the cloudy atmospheric column and premoisten it for deep convection, as demonstrated by Sherwood (1999) using a simple model."}, {"section_title": "c. TOA radiation budget", "text": "The TOA radiation budget is the energy input to the whole column (atmosphere plus ocean). Figure 14 shows that at TOA there is a substantial net radiative cooling during precipitation, about 10% of LP\u0408 (cf. Figs. 7a, 8a) for both the ARM sample (Fig. 14a) and the stronger COARE case study (Fig. 14b) effects is SW reflection by clouds, with only partial (\u03f370%) cancellation by LW cloud effects (Fig. 15 ). This imperfect cancellation at intraseasonal time scales is in contrast with the near cancellation between SW and LW CRF at the seasonal time scale (e.g., Ramanathan et al. 1989; Harrison et al. 1990; Cess et al. 2001) . Hartmann et al. (2001) and Cess et al. (2001) have shown that individual cloud types can have strongly positive or negative net CRF, with optically thin high clouds (cirrus) having positive net CRF, and optically thick high clouds and all middle and low clouds having negative net CRF (see Fig. 5 of Hartmann et al. 2001 ).\nThe climatological near-zero net CRF is a balance between cirrus clouds and all other clouds (mainly optically thick high clouds in the western Pacific). However, large seasonal-mean negative net CRF has been observed in the Asian monsoon region (Rajeevan and Sri-VOLUME 61 nivasan 2000), associated with abundant optically thick high clouds in that region, and in the western Pacific warm pool during the strong 1998 El Ni\u00f1o (Cess et al. 2001) , associated with an abundance of optically thick middle-level clouds. The large negative net CRF in the intraseasonal oscillation is associated with increased optically thick high clouds in the rainy areas, as shown in Fig. 5 ."}, {"section_title": "d.

( , 1999 have shown that this downwelling SW flux anomaly plays an important role in the variation of the ocean mixed layer heat budget during the ISO."}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "Intraseasonal variations of the atmospheric radiation budget have been estimated with collocated TOA and surface radiative flux measurements during ARM and TOGA COARE experiments, supplemented by longterm TOA flux measurement from ERBE and AVHRR. Results for a strong, classic ISO event in TOGA COARE are matched by composite time-filtered intraseasonal variability, indicating their generality. The major conclusions of this study are schematically summarized in Fig. 17 . The conclusions may be divided into two categories: the atmospheric radiation budget and the TOA radiation budget.\nFor the atmospheric radiation budget, all the different datasets consistently show that column-integrated radiative heating lags the column-integrated convective heating by less than 5 days, and enhances the convective heating by about 10%-15%. This falls short of the 20% enhancement Lee et al. (2001) estimate as necessary for the atmosphere to reach radiative-convective instability, based on the assumptions set and results of Yu et al. (1998) . There is some evidence that the enhancement factor is much larger (over 20%) in the western Indian Ocean, which is the formation region for the ISO, but this estimate reflects an especially uncertain ratio between small precipitation and OLR anomalies.\nThe atmospheric radiative heating during the convectively active phase is primarily in the longwave, as clouds and (slightly) water vapor reduce TOA outgoing longwave radiation (OLR). Surface downwelling longwave radiation and atmospheric shortwave absorption both provide slight cooling.\nIn the TOA radiation budget of the ISO, shortwave cloud forcing during the convectively active phase is about 30% larger than the opposite-signed longwave cloud forcing, indicating a net radiative energy sink to the ocean-atmosphere column. This result stands in con-L I N A N D M A P E S trast with the near cancellation between these two terms at the seasonal time scale."}]
