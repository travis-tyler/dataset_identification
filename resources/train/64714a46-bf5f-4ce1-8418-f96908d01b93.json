[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Recent studies on AD/MCI diagnosis have shown that the tasks of identifying brain disease and predicting clinical scores are highly related to each other. Furthermore, it has been shown that feature selection with a manifold learning or a sparse model can handle the problems of high feature dimensionality and small sample size.

Regarding the feature selection, to our best knowledge, most of the previous work considered a loss function defined as an element-wise difference between the target values and the predicted ones.

The newly devised loss function is combined with a group lasso method for joint feature selection across tasks, i.e., predictions of clinical scores and a class label. In order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conducted experiments on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset, and showed that the newly devised loss function helped enhance the performances of both clinical score prediction and disease status identification, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia that often appears in the persons over 65 years old. Brookmeyer et al. showed that there are 26.6 million AD patients worldwide and 1 out of 85 people will be affected by AD by 2050 (Brookmeyer et al., 2007; Fan et al., 2007; Wee et al., 2011) . Thus, for timely treatment that might be effective to slow the progression, it's highly important for early diagnosis of AD and its early stage, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Studies have shown that AD may significantly affect both structures and functions of the brain (Greicius et al., 2004; Guo et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2011; . Greicius et al. demonstrated that the disrupted connectivity between posterior cingulate and hippocampus led to the posterior cingulate hypometabolism (Greicius et al., 2004) . Guo et al. reported that AD patients exhibited significant decrease of gray matter volume in the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and insula and superior temporal gyrus (Guo et al., 2010) . However, previous imaging studies for the diagnosis of AD employed either univariate methods or group-comparison methods, thus limiting their application to disease diagnosis on an individual level (Chu et al., 2012; Lemoine et al., 2010; Li et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2012; Salas-Gonzalez et al., 2010; Wee et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2011) .\nFor the last decades, neuroimaging has been successfully used to investigate the characters of neurodegenerative progression in the spectrum between cognitive normal and AD. Particularly, different modalities provide different kinds of information for helping monitoring AD, e.g., structural brain atrophy by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) (De Leon et al., 2007; Du et al., 2007; Fjell et al., 2010; McEvoy et al., 2009) , metabolic alterations in the brain by Positron Emission Tomography (PET) (Morris et al., 2001; Santi et al., 2001) , and pathological amyloid depositions through CerebroSpinal Fluid (CSF) (Buchhave et al., 2009; Fjell et al., 2010; Hansson et al., 2006; Sepp\u00e4l\u00e4 et al., 2011) . It has been shown that the analysis of patterns in neuroimaging data for AD/MCI diagnosis can be efficiently handled by machine learning and pattern recognition methods. However, the previous studies mostly focused on developing classification models for predicting categorical class labels such as AD, MCI, and healthy Normal Control (NC). Recently, regression models have also been investigated to predict clinical scores such as Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) from individual MRI and/or PET scans Franke et al., 2010; Stonnington et al., 2010; Walhovd et al., 2010) . For example, Cheng et al. presented a novel semi-supervised multi-modal relevance vector regression method for predicting clinical scores of neurological diseases ; Duchesne et al. employed linear regression models to estimate one-year MMSE changes from structural MRI (Duchesne et al., 2009); Fan et al. and Wang et al. designed, independently, high-dimensional kernel-based regression methods to estimate ADAS-Cog and MMSE .\nUnlike those previous studies that focused on only one of the tasks (Jie et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2014; , there have been also efforts to tackle both tasks simultaneously in a unified framework. For example, Zhang and Shen proposed a method of joint feature selection for both disease diagnosis and clinical score prediction, and showed that the features used for these tasks were highly correlated . For better understanding of the underlying mechanism of AD, our interest in this paper is to predict both clinical scores and disease status jointly, and here we call it as a Joint Regression and Classification (JRC) problem.\nFor a robust model construction, it has been a long issue in the field of medical image analysis to filter out uninformative features and to overcome the small sample size problem. Wang et al. showed that only a few brain areas (such as medial temporal lobe structures, medial and lateral parietal, as well as prefrontal cortical areas) may predict memory scores and thus can be used to discriminate AD from NC . Regarding the small sample size problem, in the diagnosis of AD, the available sample size is usually small, while the feature dimensionality is high. For example, the sample size used in (Jie et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2014) was as small as 103 (i.e., 51 AD and 52 NC), while the dimensionality of features (including MRI features and PET features) was hundreds or even thousands. The small sample size makes it difficult to build a generalized model, and the highdimensional data could lead to the over-fitting issue (Zhu et al., 2012) although the number of intrinsic features may be low (Weinberger et al., 2004) .\nIn order to tackle these problems, feature selection has been commonly used in the literature. Zhang and Shen embedded an \u2113 2,1 -norm regularizer into a sparse learning model for multi-task learning . Recent studies on neuroimage-based AD/MCI diagnosis demonstrated that the consideration of the manifold of the data can further improve the performance of the feature selection model (Zhu et al., 2013a (Zhu et al., , 2013b . Moreover, manifold learning techniques have been used in the feature selection models for either regression or classification (Cho et al., 2012; Cuingnet et al., 2011; Jie et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2013 Liu et al., , 2014 . Cho et al. adopted a manifold harmonic transformation method on the cortical thickness data (Cho et al., 2012) . Liu et al. conducted the manifold learning between a predicted graph and a target graph for AD classification (Liu et al., 2013) , while Jie et al. proposed a manifold regularized multi-task learning framework to jointly select features from multi-modal data for AD diagnosis (Jie et al., 2013) . To our best knowledge, previous methods usually first conducted feature selection and then built regression or classification models for the diagnosis of AD. From a mathematical standpoint, the previous methods used a loss function defined as sum of the element-wise difference between target values and predicted ones, and considered only the manifold of feature observations, not the manifold of the target variables. Furthermore, none of the previous methods considered a manifold-based feature selection method for the JRC problem.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel loss function that considers a highlevel information inherent in the observations, and combine it with a group lasso (Yuan and Lin, 2006) for joint sparse feature selection in the JRC problem. The rationale for our approach is that, compared to the low-level neuroimaging features, it is less likely for the high-level clinical label and clinical scores to be contaminated by noises . For this reason, we build a more robust model by taking into account the relational information between high-level clinical label and clinical scores as well as the relation among samples in feature selection. This discriminates our method from the previous methods that considered only the relation among feature samples. Specifically, we define a loss function as a matrix similarity and impose the high-level information in the target response matrix to be preserved in the predicted response matrix. For the high-level information, we use the relations between response samples and the relations between response variables in a response matrix, each of which we call as 'sample-sample relation' and 'variable-variable relation'. Hereafter, each column and each row of a matrix denote, respectively, one sample and one response variable. In our work, a sample in a response matrix consists of clinical scores and a class label, and each of the clinical scores or a class label is considered as a response variable. By utilizing these high-level information inherent in the target response matrix and imposing them to be preserved in the predicted response matrix, we define a more sophisticated loss function, which affects feature selection, and thus enhances the performances of the regression and classification in AD/MCI diagnosis."}, {"section_title": "Materials and image preprocessing", "text": "For performance evaluation, we use the ADNI dataset publicly available on the web. The ADNI was launched in 2003 by the National Institute on Aging (NIA), the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), private pharmaceutical companies, and non-profit organizations. The main goal of ADNI was designed to test if the serial of MRI, PET, other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of MCI and early AD. To this end, ADNI recruited over 800 adults (aged 55 to 90) to participate in the research. More specifically, approximately 200 cognitively normal older individuals were followed for 3 years, 400 people with MCI were followed for 3 years, and 200 people with early AD were followed for 2 years.\n1 The research protocol was approved by each local institutional review board and the written informed consent was obtained from each participant."}, {"section_title": "Subjects", "text": "The general inclusion/exclusion criteria of the subjects are briefly described as follows:\n1.

Specifically, we first performed anterior commissure-posterior commissure correction using MIPAV software 3 on all images, and used the N3 algorithm (Sled et al., 1998) to correct the intensity inhomogeneity. Second, we extracted a brain on all structural MR images using a robust skullstripping method, followed by manual edition and intensity inhomogeneity correction. After removal of cerebellum based on registration and intensity inhomogeneity correction by repeating N3 for three times, we used FAST algorithm in the FSL package (Zhang et al., 2001 ) to segment the structural MR images into three different tissues: Gray Matter (GM), White Matter (WM), and CerebroSpinal Fluid (CSF). Next, we used HAMMER 4 (Shen and Davatzikos, 2002) (although other methods (Jia et al., 2010; Qiao et al., 2009; Shen et al., 1999; Shen and Davatzikos, 2004; Yang et al., 2008; Zacharaki et al., 2008) can be used) to conduct registration and obtained the Region-Of-Interest (ROI)-labeled image based on the Jacob template, which dissects a brain into 93 ROIs (Kabani, 1998) . For each of all 93 ROI regions in the labeled image of one subject, we computed the GM tissue volumes in the ROI region by integrating the GM segmentation result of this subject. And, for each subject, we first aligned the PET image to its respective MR T1 image using affine registration and then computed the average intensity of each ROI in the PET image. Finally, for each subject, we obtained totally 93 features from MRI, 93 features from PET, and 3 features from CSF.

Fig. 1 presents a schematic diagram of our method for predictions of clinical scores and a class label. Given MRI, PET, and CSF data, we first extract features from MRI and PET, while we use the CSF data itself as CSF features. We then construct a feature matrix X with a concatenation of multimodal features at each column, and a corresponding response matrix Y with a concatenation of clinical scores (e.g., ADAS-Cog, MMSE) and a class label at each column. With our new loss function and a group lasso method, we select features that are jointly used to represent the clinical scores and the class label. By using the dimension-reduced data, we build clinical score regression models and a clinical label identification model with Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Support Vector Classification (SVC), respectively."}, {"section_title": "Notations", "text": "In this paper, we denote matrices as boldface uppercase letters, vectors as boldface lowercase letters, and scalars as normal italic letters, respectively.

In our work, the response variables correspond to ADAS-Cog, MMSE, and a class label. We assume that the response variables can be predicted by a weighted linear combination of the features as follows:\nwhere W \u2208 \u211d d \u00d7 c is a regression matrix. By regarding the prediction of each response variable as a task and constraining the same features to be used across tasks, we can use a group lasso method (Yuan and Lin, 2006) formulated as follows:\nwhere f(W) is a loss function depending on W and \u03bb is a sparsity control parameter. Note that each element in a column w k of W assigns a weight to each of the observed features in predicting the k-th response variable. The \u2113 2,1 -norm regularizer \u2016W\u2016 2,1 penalizes all coefficients in the same row of W together for joint selection or un-selection in predicting the response variables. Specifically, the \u2113 2 -norm regularizer enforces the selection of the same features across all tasks, and the \u2113 1 -norm imposes the feature sparseness in the linear combination. In our JRC problem, this \u2113 2,1 -norm selects the ROIs that are highly relevant to the estimation of both clinical scores and a class label. With regard to the loss function in Eq. (2), the most commonly used metric in the literature is the element-wise distance between the target response matrix Y and the predicted response matrix\u0176 as follows:\nThis element-wise loss function has been successfully used in many objective functions in the literature Yuan and Lin, 2006; . From a matrix similarity point of view, Eq. (3) measures the matrix similarity between Y and\u0176 with the sum of the element-wise differences between matrices. Note that, in this case, the lower the score is, the more similar they are. However, we believe that there exists additional information inherent in the matrices, which we can use in measuring the similarity, such as the relations between any pair of columns and the relations between any pair of rows in a matrix. In our case, the columns and the rows correspond, respectively, to samples and response variables. Ideally, besides the element-wise values, those relations in the target response matrix Y should be preserved in the predicted response matrix\u0176. Concretely, the row-wise relations find the correlations of a clinical label and ADAS-Cog, a clinical label and MMSE, and ADAS-Cog and MMSE over samples, and the column-wise relations represent the correlation between any pair of samples over response variables. By enriching the loss function with the higher-level information and imposing the information to be matched between two matrices, we can find an optimal regression matrix W that helps accurately predict the target response values, and thus select useful features. The selected features can be finally used for more accurate prediction of testing samples in both the clinical scores and a class label.\nTo better characterize the newly devised loss function, we explain them in the context of a graph matching. We illustrate the samplesample (a pair of columns) relations, e.g., (y i -y j ) or \u00f0\u0177 i \u2212\u0177 j \u00de, and the variable-variable (a pair of rows) relations, e.g., (y\nmeans of a graph in Figs. 2(a) and (b), respectively. In Fig. 2(a) , a node represents one sample, i.e., a column vector y i or\u0177 i in the respective matrices, an edge in a graph denotes the relation between the connected nodes, and different colors denote different class labels. In the graph, the samples of the same class would have a small distance, whereas the samples of different classes would have a large distance. In Fig. 2(b) , a node represents a set of observations for a response variable, i.e., a row vector in the respective matrices, and an edge denotes the relation between nodes.\nAs explained above, we impose these relational properties in a target response matrix, now represented by graphs, to be preserved in the respective graphs for the predicted response matrix as follows:\nwhere G Y S and G \u015c Y denote, respectively, graphs representing the samplesample relations for the target response matrix Y and the predicted response matrix\u0176 , and G Y V and G V Y denote, respectively, graphs representing the variable-variable relations for the target response matrix Y and the predicted response matrix\u0176. Hereafter, we call the graphs representing the sample-sample relations and the variablevariable relations as 'S-graph' and 'V-graph', respectively. We formulate the problem of matching two sets of graphs, i.e., S-graph and V-graph, as follows: y 1 \nwhere M S and M V denote, respectively, the graph matching scores between G Y S and G \u015c Y , and between G Y V and G V Y , and n and c denote, respectively, the numbers of samples and response variables in the matrices as mentioned above. By introducing these newly devised graph matching terms into the loss function of Eq. (3), our new loss function becomes as follows:\nwhere \u03b1 1 and \u03b1 2 denote, respectively, the control parameters for the respective terms. Compared to the conventional element-wise loss function in Eq. (3), the proposed function additionally considers two graph matching regularization terms. Finally, our objective function for feature selection can be written as follows:\nIt is worth noting that unlike the previous manifold learning methods, i.e., local linear embedding (Roweis and Saul, 2000) , locality preserving projection (He et al., 2005) , and high-order graph matching (Liu et al., 2013) , that focused on the sample similarities by imposing nearby samples to be still nearby in the transformed space, the proposed method imposes more strict constraints, i.e., sample-sample relations and variable-variable relations, in finding the optimal regression matrix W."}, {"section_title": "Objective function optimization", "text": "After some mathematical transformations, we can simplify M S and M V as follows:\nwhere\nis an identity matrix of size n (or c), and 1 n (or 1 c ) is a column vector of n (or c) ones.

(12) is convex, due to the nonsmooth term of \u2225 W \u2225 2,1 , it is not straightforward to find the global optimum. Furthermore, due to the inter-dependence in computing matrices of W and Q, it's not trivial to solve Eq. (13). To this end, in this work, we apply an iterative approach to optimize Eq. (13) by alternatively computing Q and W. That is, at the t-th iteration, we first update the matrix W(t) with the matrix Q(t \u2212 1) fixed and then update the matrix Q(t) with the updated matrix W(t).

For example, for MRI-based classification as shown in Table 3 , even using a simple feature selection method, i.e., MRI-S, can still increase the classification accuracy by 1.7%, 8.4%, and 4.25% compared to MRI-N in AD vs. NC, MCI vs. NC, and MCI-C vs.\nMCI-NC classifications, respectively. Our method with MPC improved the classification accuracy by 5.1%, 9.5%, and 8.5%, in AD vs. NC, MCI vs. NC, and MCI-C vs. MCI-NC classifications, respectively.\n\u2022 It is beneficial to use joint regression and classification framework for feature selection, even only for the task of classification. As shown in Table 3 and Fig. 3 , the proposed method that performed feature selection for joint regression and classification achieved better classification performance than the single-task based classification methods (MRI-S, PET-S, MP-S, and MPC-S). For example, for MRIbased classification, our method improved the classification accuracy by 2.6%, 3.0%, and 6.3% compared to MRI-S based method in AD vs. NC, MCI vs. NC, and MCI-C vs. MCI-NC classifications, respectively.\n\u2022 Multi-modality data helps improve classification performance. As shown in Table 3 , in all experiments, the classification performances of all methods with multi-modality data such as MP and MPC were better than the same methods with single-modality data such as MRI or PET. Also, the classification performance by MPC was generally better than MP. For example, in classifying AD from NC, the proposed method with MPC achieved the classification accuracy of 95.9%, sensitivity of 95.7%, specificity of 98.6%, and AUC of 98.8%, while the best performance among other competing methods with singlemodality data was only 93.8% (accuracy), 92.3% (sensitivity), 96.7% (specificity), and 97.9% (AUC), respectively, and the best performance among other competing methods with MP data was 95.3% (accuracy), 94.9% (sensitivity), 98.1% (specificity), and 98.3% (AUC), respectively. In classifying MCI from NC, the proposed method with MPC achieved the classification accuracy of 82.0%, sensitivity of 98.0%, specificity of 60.1%, and AUC of 87.0%, while the best performance among other competing methods with single-modality data was only 79.7% (accuracy), 96.5% (sensitivity), 56.1% (specificity), and 85.2% (AUC), respectively, and the best performance among other competing methods with MP data was 80.2% (accuracy), 97.0% (sensitivity), 67.1% (specificity), and 85.5% (AUC), respectively. In classifying MCI-C from MCI-NC, the proposed method with MPC achieved the classification accuracy of 72.6%, sensitivity of 48.5%, specificity of 94.4%, and AUC of 78.8%, while the best accuracy among other competing methods with single-modality data was only 70.9% (accuracy), 42.7% (sensitivity), 95.5% (specificity), and 77.4% (AUC), respectively, and the best performance among other competing methods with MP was 72.0% (accuracy), 64.7% (sensitivity), 96.8% (specificity), and 78.7% (AUC), respectively."}, {"section_title": "Regression results", "text": "We evaluated the regression performance through the estimation of clinical scores (i.e., ADAS-Cog and MMSE) for the cases of using MRI, PET, MP, and MPC, respectively. We presented the results of CCs and RMSEs of all competing methods in Table 4 and Figs. 5-9, respectively. Table 4 shows that the proposed method outperforms all other competing methods, when using a combination of three multi-modality data. Fig. 5 shows the regression performance of our method with a single-task or a multi-task learning scheme. Figs. 6-9 further show the scatter plots of the target scores vs. the estimated scores of our method for ADAS-Cog and MMSE, respectively, when using 4 different types of data.

Moreover, our method consistently achieved the best performance compared to other competing methods. Table 4 We also compared the proposed method with its variants, i.e., the single response (or single task) based method in Fig. 5 . From the figure, we can see that the joint formulation of registration and classification outperforms the single-task based regression, same as for the classification task above."}, {"section_title": "Results summary", "text": "From our experimental results, we found that (1) the proposed method formulated in a joint regression and classification framework outperformed its counterpart that was formulated separately for regression or classification; (2) the joint use of multiple modalities outperformed the case of using a single modality separately. Moreover, the paired-sample t-tests (at 95% significance level) between results of our method and all other competing methods (e.g., with the p-values of all cases less than 0.025 and most cases less than 0.001) showed that our method was significantly better than all other methods on the tasks of predicting clinical scores (i.e., ADAS-Cog and MMSE) and identifying class label.\nWe also compared our method with M3T ) that used the element-wise loss function in feature selection and also the methods that considered only either 'sample-sample relation' (S-graph) or 'variable-variable relation' (V-graph). In Fig. 10 , we can see that (1) both S-graph and V-graph based methods showed better performances in regression and classification than M3T. The mean improvement by both S-graph and V-graph based methods was about 1% compared to M3T.

Since the feature selection in each fold was performed only based on the training set, the selected features could vary across different cross-validations. We thus defined the most discriminative regions based on the selected frequency of each region over the cross-validations. The top 10 selected regions in MCI vs. NC classification with MPC were marked in Fig. 11 . They were amygdala right, hippocampal formation left, hippocampal formation right, entorhinal cortex left, temporal pole left, parahippocampal gyrus left, uncus left, perirhinal cortex left, cunecus left, and temporal pole right. It is noteworthy that the top six-ranked brain regions are known to be highly related to AD and MCI in many previous studies (Ch\u00e9telat et al., 2005; Convit et al., 2000; Fox and Schott, 2004; Liu et al., 2014; Misra et al., 2009; . Moreover, according to Table 5 , almost all the competing methods 11 selected these six regions as the top selected regions. Even though most of the methods (including our methods and the competing methods) in our experiments selected these six features as a part of their final feature set, our proposed method outperforms the competing methods since it can select more useful features than the competing methods thanks to consideration of high-level information.\n11 The selected brain regions by both M2TFS-C and M2TFS-K were conducted on MP data.

Specifically, we used high-level information inherent in the target response matrix and imposed the information to be preserved in the predicted response matrix. Our objective function for joint feature selection was formulated by combining the newly devised loss function with a group lasso. In our extensive experiments on ADNI dataset, we validated the effectiveness of the proposed method by showing the performance enhancements of both the clinical scores (ADAS-Cog and MMSE) prediction and the class label identification, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods.
