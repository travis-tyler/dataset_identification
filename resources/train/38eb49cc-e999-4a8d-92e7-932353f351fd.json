The intermediate outcome of this combination of factors is a variety of forms of human capital, and ones most frequently studied are health and cognitive development (years of schooling and test scores, for example.) Numerous papers have been written on poor-nonpoor gaps in health and school performance among children but far fewer on non-cognitive gaps by SES, even though evidence is accumulating that these non-cognitive skills may also be critically important as determinants of future success.\nBeginning primarily with work by Case et al. (2002) , economists and other social scientists have focused on the childhood origins of the large differences in health and economic status during adulthood. This work showed that the relationship between family income and child health grows stronger as children age, likely in part due to the cumulative effects of living in low-income households who face associated stress, more frequent health shocks and limited access to health care. This research has spawned a large set of papers that show that these empirical relationships can be found across countries with very different welfare and health 2\" \" systems as well as across time periods (Currie and Stabile 2003 , Condliffe and Link 2008 , Khanama et al. 2009 , Propper et al. 2007 ; See Fletcher and Wolfe 2014 for review).\nA relatively less studied but related question is whether similar patterns exist in other areas of childhood development, such as so-called \"non-cognitive\" (socio-emotional/ personality) skills. As opposed to cognitive skills, which are measured by scores on tests such as reading, math, history or science as well as IQ tests, noncognitive skills are both more difficult to measure and there is less agreement on which ones are important. 1, 2 The limited agreement on both the conceptualization of noncognitive skills and inconsistent measurement may contribute to the lack of attention by economists.\nThe limited study of non-cognitive or socio-emotional skills is a potentially important omission since socio-emotional skills may be a critical factor in predicting a range of important adult outcomes. This domain of skill formation has also become the subject of intense study in economics in recent years 3 . For example, work with the NLSY (Heckman, Sixtrud and Urzua 2006) found that locus of control and self-esteem were likely critical in determining years of schooling 4, 5 . In a recent overview paper, Brunello and Schlotter (2011) suggest that noncognitive skills are important as determinants of these skills but also of cognitive skills more \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" \" 1 For adults, economists have tended to use a five-factor model related to personality psychology: conscientiousness, emotional stability, agreeableness, extraversion and autonomy (Nyhus and Pns, 2005) . These overlap but are not entirely identical to the big five among psychologists who use \"OCEAN\"; openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism (similar to emotional stability). See John 1990. 2 For children, while there is some overlap (independence for example), there is somewhat more emphasis on maturity, learning skills, motivation, attention, patience, and the ability to act appropriately (externalizing and internalizing behaviors)(see ter Weel 2008 and related papers in the symposium covered by the 2008 volume of the Journal of Human Resources). 3 Heckman stated...\"the preoccupation with cognition and academic smarts as measured by test scores to the exclusion of social adaptability and motivation causes a serious bias in the evaluation of many human capital interventions..\" 1999, p. 1 Heckman J, (1999) , Policies to Foster Human Capital, NBER Working Paper 7288 4 Their results suggest that going from the 25 th to 75 th percentile in the distribution of non-cognitive skills is associated with a 25 percentage point increase in the probability of having graduated college by age 30 5 Fletcher (2012) shows evidence that the personality trait of extroversion is positively related to labor market outcomes.

We study this issue for a particular set of noncognitive skills; a priori we have no expectation that the tie from parental income to noncognitive skills will be similar, much less the same, across all noncognitive skills. In supplementary analysis, we also attempt to ascertain the links from noncognitive skills to cognitive skills and/or whether noncognitive skills appear to be influenced by earlier cognitive skills in order to further understand the importance and determinants of the various non-cognitive measures in the data.\nIncreasing our understanding of the factors critical in explaining the formation of socioemotional skills during childhood and also whether the divergence in these skills is in part due to family resources is our focus. Evidence on this question may provide clues on whether policies that increase the resources of low income households may have positive effects on children's socio-emotional development, though the descriptive results in this paper serve only as a first step in this direction. . This paper uses a recent panel study from the US that tracks a national sample of children between Kindergarten and 5 th grade to examine the associations between family income and a broad set of measures of children's socio-emotional skill development.

The results from the analysis suggest important deficits in socio-emotional skills at schoolentry for children from low-income households that grow as children age.

What is available is relatively recent and has focused on the consequences of non-cognitive skills, typically on labor market outcomes or schooling outcomes.\nIn contrast, virtually no research in the economics literature has focused on understanding the determinants of non-cognitive skills or their evolution using panel data. Broadly, consequences of poor non-cognitive skills have been found in several areas of the labor market, including job performance, wages, and occupational choice, as well as in educational outcomes for children of all ages. Additionally, some economics research has attempted to understand the potential complementarities between non-cognitive skills and cognitive skills in these labor market outcomes and have broadly shown extensive complementarity."}, {"section_title": "5\" \"", "text": "Amongst the early economics study of the importance of non-cognitive skills was the study of general education degrees (or GED) recipients (Heckman and Rubinstein 2001) , which provided evidence that while GED recipients have cognitive test scores equal to those of high school graduates, on average, they only have earnings equal to those of high school dropouts.\nOne explanation for this pattern is that GED recipients tend to have limited non-cognitive skills.\nIt is this lack of skills that prevents them from being successful in the military, the labor force and in personal relationships.\nWith this evidence on labor market outcomes, there has also been interest in whether educational attainments and health are affected directly. For example, in an early examination, Coleman and DeLeire (2003) use a measure of locus of control 6 to explore the importance of this particular noncognitive trait in influencing years of schooling. More recently, a broad overview paper on personality characteristics (a variety of noncognitive factors) and their importance for years of schooling found that conscientiousness was an important predictor of both grades and years of schooling, while openness to experience was important for years of schooling (Borghans et al 2006) . This paper reports on a meta analysis from the psychology literature which looks at evidence on the importance of personality traits in explaining job performance, health and schooling success. This review suggested that while IQ was a more important factor than any of the big 5 personality traits, conscientiousness was an important factor for college grades and years of schooling. Indeed, conscientiousness was the single most important predictor of life expectancy (more important than IQ), but the two were reversed in terms of predicting job performance. Conscientiousness was found to be important for all jobs while IQ was most \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" \" 6\" \" important for complex jobs, including professors, scientists and senior managers (Schmidt and Hunter 2004) . Coneus, Gernandt and Saam (2009) also explored this issue using the German Socio-economic panel and found an important role for noncognitive skills in reducing the probability of dropping out of school and that the importance of these skills increased with age.\nFurther decoupling the importance of non-cognitive skills for education and labor market success, Judge and Hurst (2007) showed that positive self reports of self esteem, internal locus of control, and emotional stability usefully predict future income over and above both grades and years of schooling using data for the U.S. from NLSY 1979. In essence they find that more schooling and better grades are important for those with positive personality traits but do not pay off otherwise. They speculate that those who rate high on these traits search for challenging and rewarding jobs, persist on difficult tasks, and are motivated to tackle any failure.\nThis emerging evidence on the importance of non-cognitive skills on adult socioeconomic outcomes then leads to the question of how early in life these skills appear to be important determinants of outcomes. A study using British data attempted to understand the importance of cognitive and noncognitive skills on years of schooling (Carneiro, Crawford and Goodman 2006) . Noncognitive skills were measured by social adjustment at age 11 and the authors found that children who had higher levels of social adjustment at age 11 were more likely to remain in school past age 16 and to get a higher degree. They also found that the influence of higher cognitive skills on these two outcomes is low if social adjustment is low but important if social adjustment skills are high, again suggesting interactive effects.\nWith these findings suggesting the importance of the early development of non-cognitive skills on later life outcomes, a few tentative policy-related findings have also emerged. For example, Cunha et al. (2006) suggest that much of the effectiveness of early childhood 7\" \" interventions seem to come from increasing noncognitive skills and motivation. The authors suggest that while IQ is fairly stable after age 10, self-control, motivation and other traits are malleable at later ages (see also Heckman 2000) . 7, 8 This emerging evidence of the importance of non-cognitive skills for adolescent and adult socioeconomic outcomes as well as the preliminary work suggesting that these skills are malleable for school-aged children suggest a need to further document the critical determinants of non-cognitive skills during childhood. 9 Indeed, there is very little evidence of the links between family income and socioemotional skills development during childhood 10 . One of the few examinations in the literature was done by Violato et al. (2011) , utilizing data from the UK.\nThe authors find substantial links that are \"explained\" by several family processes such as parental stress and investments in children. However, these authors focus on younger aged children (through age 5), while the current paper traces outcomes between the ages of 6 and 12. 11"}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "In this paper we use the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Cohort data (ECLS-K).

For example, see Dahl and Lochner (2012) for one such analysis. 11 The data also contain a limited number of socioemotional skills and these skills are often not assessed the same way as children age.

The core survey contains reports by parents, children, and teachers in a variety of standard domains, though the study focuses on educational experiences of schoolage children. 13 Since income is measured at each wave, we construct a measure of \"permanent income\" that averages the income measures up to the current survey grade. 14 In addition to standard sociodemographic and education questions, the study collected direct cognitive and noncognitive assessments in each wave, including reading and mathematics test scores, and social/emotional scales. The social and emotional development assessments were created to focus on aspects of social competence that include social skills (self control, cooperation) and problem behaviors (impulsivity and aggression). These assessments were formed based on reports of both teachers and parents, though we focus on teacher reports in this paper 15 .

Teachers and school administrators completed questionnaires at their schools. Details on assessments can be found at http://nces.ed.gov/ecls/kinderassessments.asp. 14 For example, the measure of permanent income for 3 rd graders is the average of the income reports for Kindergarten, First Grade, and Third Grade for each student. This has the disadvantage of increasing in accuracy as the child ages. We prefer it to permanent income across all grades as that measure would include measures after the observed measure of noncognitive skills. 15 Teacher assessments are likely to be comparable, at least across children in the same classroom, than those of individual parents. Teacher assessments may be relative within their current and past classrooms; nevertheless we view them as likely more consistent and informative than parent's assessments, which are based on a far smaller set of children."}, {"section_title": "9\" \"", "text": "Learning.\" The subcomponents of the Approaches to Learning scale have been released to researchers through a separate contractual agreement and include the following items: \"Keeps belongings organized\"; \"Shows eagerness to learn new things\"; \"Works independently\"; \"Easily adapts to changes in routine\"; \"Persists in completing tasks\"; and \"Pays attention well\". Table 1 presents summary statistics for grades Kindergarten and 5 th grade and include all children present in the sample for each grade. The social ratings scales range from 1-4, but since they are averages of many sub-scales, they are \"continuous\". The scales do not substantially increase between Kindergarten and 5 th grade suggesting that teachers may treat them as relative rather than absolute skills. Special education rates increase from 4 to 10% between K and 5 th grade. The similarities in the observable characteristics (e.g. maternal education, birth weight) in the table between Kindergarten and 5 th grade suggest that attrition issues are not substantial. Table 2 further divides the Approaches to Learning scale into its relevant subscales. Since these sub-scales include values of 1-4, we also provide the descriptive distributions of the sub-scales in the sample. Many scales are quite stable between Kindergarten and 5 th grade, though most show slight decreases, with the \"eager to learn\" subscale exhibiting the most prominent decline as these children age.\nBelow we test our hypothesis that as children age there is an increasing tie between family income and the full set of available social-emotional skill indices. Thus we hypothesize that the disparity in noncognitive skills increases over the childhood period with children in higher income families increasingly being more advantaged. Our hypothesis is consistent with most evidence examining childhood health and some evidence regarding cognitive outcomes (e.g. Case et al. 2002) . Our prior work using the same data set we use here provided evidence of the steepening of the income gradient with regard to health (Fletcher and Wolfe, 2011) . We"}, {"section_title": "10\" \"", "text": "believe that the same link will exist between income and noncognitive skills. These skills are likely to be sensitive to stress, family stability, parents' emotional status and safety in one's neighborhood. All of these are tied to income. All of them have some likely overlap in the way they influence health 16 . It is on this basis that we formed our hypothesis. In particular we hypothesize that children growing up in homes with greater income will 1) have higher socioemotional (noncognitive) skills and 2) that these differences will increase over time such that the tie between family income and each socio-emotional scale variable will be greater as the child ages. The basis for our hypothesis is that children in lower income families are likely to experience more stress, more family instability, see fewer successful role models in their neighborhood, and may also be more exposed to environmental hazards, among other experiences of disadvantage. 17 To test these hypotheses, we employ a standard empirical human capital model:\nwhere S it the skill of interest for child i at time t is a function of family income and a vector of demographic control variables including age, sex, race, parental characteristics such as education, age, and marital status. We expect that the coefficient on log Y will be positive in our regression estimates for each grade. We also expect that the coefficient on log Y will be larger at higher grades.

The other control variables all have the expected signs but few are statistically significant at standard levels: the exceptions are racial dummy variables and maternal education. The increasing tie between income and health can be substantiated by converting the coefficients into marginal effects. 17 Recent evidence shows that gray matter in areas of the brain such as the prefrontal lobe, which is important for executive function or non cognitive functions, exhibit a maturation gap among children growing up in poor families. See Pollak et al 2015.

We expect that using permanent income (income measured in all years prior and contemporary with the time noncognitive skills are measured) will show a steeper tie between income and noncognitive outcomes than the use of single-year current income. This is because noncognitive skills develop over time and so will be influenced by prior income as well as current income and because permanent income is a better measure of family income. We conduct a test of this hypothesis to try and separate the effect of less noise in the measure from a cumulative effect.

We begin by examining whether there are differences in socioemotional skills by family income as children enter school. In Table 3 , we present the income differences in our set of socioemotional skills at Kindergarten. The first three measures of socioemotional skills, approaches to learning, interpersonal skills and self-control are all positive indicators; the last two, externalizing and internalizing are negative indicators. All five show the expected relationship to a family's permanent income at Kindergarten entry. Externalizing appears somewhat less robustly tied to family income -the statistical significance is only at the 10 percent level. Overall these simple relationships suggest that children from lower income families begin school with disadvantages in terms of their noncognitive skills and that this holds across multiple measure of skills. We expect these differences to grow, but it is possible that 12\" \" once children spend time in school, differences tied to parental resources could be reduced or even eliminated.\nIn Table 4 , we begin our examination of the determinants of trajectories of socioemotional skills by focusing on the Approaches to Learning scale 18 . Our focus is on the tie to family income. We find substantial evidence that children living in higher income families have higher scores on approaches to learning. And the general pattern is one of increasing advantage as the children age though the pattern is primarily observed between K and 5 th grade.\nThe results (coefficients) show that the tie from income to approaches to learning more than doubles from kindergarten to the fifth grade. 19 In terms of other included variables, males have lower scores on this scale than females-a nearly 1/3 standard deviation difference that grows as the children age. Black students enter school with lower scores on this scale and this difference also grows to over 1/10 th of a standard deviations. In contrast, Hispanic students have a relative advantage that fluctuates over time in comparison to whites. Children with parents with higher education also have small and persistent advantages on this skill measure. Table 5 shows these results are quite similar for each of the subscales: attention, organized, eager to learn, independent, adaptable and persistence. All of these exhibit an analogous pattern in terms of the tie to family income. The ties are strongest for organization and persistence. We provide formal tests of statistical differences in these tables; typically the differences between Kindergarten and first grade are not statistically significant nor are the differences between 3 rd and 5 th grade, though there are typically substantial differences between Kindergarten and 3 rd and/or 5 th grades.\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" \" 13\" \" Table 6 presents results for several additional indices of socio-emotional behavior, selfcontrol, interpersonal skills, and mental health outcomes and special education status. Consistent with the results for approaches to learning in Table 4 , we find sizeable differences in many of the skill indices by family income, and these gaps double in size as children age from kindergarten through 5 th grade. For mental health outcomes, we examine internalizing and externalizing scales. Internalizing scales are more akin to measures of depression and anxiety whereas externalizing measures are typically thought of as emotional behavioral disorders and conduct disorders. We find relatively large differences in the evolution of these scales as children age.\nChildren from poorer families have higher externalizing scores at school entry, but the disparity is relatively constant beginning with first grade and continuing through fifth grade. In contrast, children from poorer families also enter Kindergarten with higher internalizing score, and this gap triples by 5 th grade. We find little evidence of initial differences in special education status by family income, though by 5 th grade family income is a strong predictor of placement.\nFinally, we present a summary measure of all the socioemotional skills in the data using factor analysis and again find large initial differences in these skills at Kindergarten entry that grow substantially by fifth grade."}, {"section_title": "Robustness and Potential Mechanisms", "text": "We consider several additional examinations of potential mechanisms that may account for a portion of the patterns we find in the data. We first ask whether it is family income that directly influences non-cognitive skills or whether it is the purchase of attendance at schools with 14\" \" peers who have higher noncognitive skills 20 . The results presented in Table 7 suggest that family income plays a direct role but that part of the influence may be through \"purchasing\" better school peers, which may occur through paying for private school tuition or, more commonly, through purchasing housing in areas with \"better schools\" (defined here according to average noncognitive ability of students attending the school). For most estimates and nearly all of our measures of noncognitive skills, including, in particular, the combined factor, self control, organization, eager to learn, interpersonal skills, adaptability independent and approaches to learning, the direct influence of family income is positive, it increases as the child ages, and the family level gradient is reduced by the inclusion of the average noncognitive factor of other classmates sampled in the ECLS-K 21 .\nInterestingly, for many of these outcomes the results for 5 th grade differ and suggest that when the school-level noncognitive factor is included, the influence of family income actually increases. These results then provide evidence of the robustness of the income gradient of noncognitive skills and also suggest that school composition in terms of these skills may be most important in the earliest grades. This is consistent with literature on the importance of readiness to learn in the earliest grades, a philosophy tied to Head Start funding. 22 It is also consistent with findings on the Perry Pre-School project, which did not appear to increase IQ, though it did improve scores and personality traits.

However we are less interested in how the school group influences the individual but rather whether inclusion of the group \"behaviors\" reduces the influence of family income. Given this we proceed but with caution. 21 An alternative explanation of these findings is that, since the socioemotional skill measures are reported by the teacher for all children in the classroom, we are in part controlling for teacher styles of reporting and not objective measures of skills. 22 When we run a set of similar estimates using test scores as the outcome and a test score factor for the school we find a somewhat similar pattern. In these specifications, there is a strong tie between family income and performance on tests (math, reading or a combination) that is increasing over grades K to 8 th grade. The inclusion of the school mean test score factor reduces the influence of income slightly with the greatest reduction in Kindergarten (by more than half) but only by about 10% by grades 5 and 8.

As we noted above, there is substantial evidence of strong links between family income and childhood health across many countries and time periods, including the dataset used in this study (see Fletcher and Wolfe 2014) . Thus, it could be the case that an important channel linking family income and children's non-cognitive skills is through this established health channel. Our results in Table 8 suggest that child health could play a role in the process. For about half of our socioemotional measures, we find statistical differences in specifications that control for lagged child health compared with our baseline results.

In particular, in the fixed effects model, we remove the \"permanent\" component of income, which is the primary focus of this article; in addition, measurement error in family income and in the socioemotional measures could attenuate our results without signaling an important role for intergenerational transmission of socioemotional skills tied to income. These analyses also do not adequately take into account the dynamic effects 26 of income on socioemotional skill accumulation, which limits our ability to interpret the results.\nAppendix Table D reports these results. We find evidence that controlling for child fixed effects (and thus time-invariant parental characteristics) does not eliminate the effects of income, although the effects are clearly smaller and less significant. The estimated pattern is suggestive evidence that income is not simply proxying for parental non-cognitive skills rather than of family resources. This result is consistent with the limited role of parental schooling in our core estimates."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we use a recent US panel of school-aged children followed between Kindergarten and 5 th grade to examine the effects of family income on children's non-cognitive \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" \" 25 We thank Elaine Liu for suggesting this line of inquiry. 26 \"One way to think about this issue is that, like sibling fixed effects models, if there are spillovers between units, the estimates will be biased.

Although economists have long examined the relationships between family circumstances and children's health and cognitive development (i.e. school performance and test scores), there is very limited research providing information examining the potential effects on a broader and complementary set of skills. We find strong evidence of the importance of this often overlooked set of outcomes.\nFor our national sample, we document several stylized facts. We provide evidence that children enter Kindergarten with substantial differences in non-cognitive skill endowments based on family resources. We then trace the evolution of these skill differences as children age through the 5 th grade (12 years old) and show that the disadvantages grow substantially-often doubling or tripling in magnitude over the six years of this study window. We finally assess whether these skill differences can be explained by alternative measures of income, differences in children's health, differences in parental time invariant characteristics (such as their own noncognitive skills) or differences in peer (classmate) skills. In each case, we find our results to be largely robust to these alternatives, suggesting a compelling link between family income and children's non-cognitive skill development net of these other factors that are independently associated with family income.\nThese results are important for understanding the intergenerational transmission of poverty or SES more generally. They suggest that beyond those outcomes already studied (health and cognitive outcomes) that family income also influences noncognitive skills. These skills are themselves important in determining an individual's success in schooling and in later employment outcomes. Noncognitive skill differences seem to be an important route by which one's family of origin influences one's future family's SES."}, {"section_title": "19\" \"", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "25\" \"", "text": "Appendix A"}, {"section_title": "Tie between non-cognitive and cognitive skills", "text": "In order to gain some insight into the importance of noncognitive skills for traditionally measured measures of cognitive skills, we create a \"noncognitive factor,\" which is calculated as the first principle component of the SRS scales described above. As expected, it loads positively on each scale except for the internalizing/externalizing measures. This non-cognitive factor thus captures the core common elements of all of the measured noncognitive skills. We then ask the role of these factors in explaining cognitive skills as captured by test scores. For test scores we also combine the reading and mathematics scores using factor analysis. We call the combination \"test score factor\".\nIn order to first establish some notion of the importance for the non-cognitive skills on future outcomes, we estimate a set of models in which the test score factor is the dependent variable and either the noncognitive test score factor (or all of the separate scores for the noncognitive factors) is included in a regression. Also included is a set of control variables such as the child's sex, age, race dummies, birth weight, each of the two parents' schooling levels when available, mother's age, and whether or not the parents were married at the time of data collection. The results using the noncognitive factor suggest a strong and statistically significant relationship between the non-cognitive factor to the test score factor. We lag the noncognitive factor in order to avoid any simultaneity issues.\nThe results, reported in Appendix Table A suggest the following: lagged noncognitive factors are a very important determinant of test scores. The tie is consistent over time with a coefficient between 0.26 and 0.30, and significant at the 1 percent level in all grades. Because the factors are each standardized, the results suggest that a one-standard deviation increase in 26\" \" lagged non-cognitive skills is associated with between a 0.25-0.30 standard deviation increase in current-period test scores. 27 But which components of noncognitive skills seem most related to test score performance? Our next results disaggregate the \"non-cognitive factor\" into its component parts and suggest that being independent, being eager to learn, paying attention, and being persistence are highly associated with test scores. In terms of negative skills, those most detrimental to performance on test scores are internalizing, interpersonal skills, and self-control. The latter are surprising in two respects -two of these noncognitive skills may have been expected to be positive (interpersonal skills and self control). We also find a lack of association between externalizing behavior and test scores. Even with these surprises, the estimates provide strong confirmation of the tie between noncognitive skills and cognitive skills \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" \" 27 Classens et al.
