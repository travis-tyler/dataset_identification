[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Farmers' perceptions of and responses to risk are important in understanding their risk behaviour. In the literature, extensive normative analysis (with mathematical programming etc.) can be found, showing how farmers should behave under uncertainty (e.g. Hardaker et al., 2004). But surprisingly few studies have examined how farmers perceive risk and manage it in practice. Organic farmers are exposed to additional and different sources of risk compared to conventional farmers. Restrictions on pesticide use, fertilizers etc. influence production risk (Padel & Lampkin, 1994a). Smaller organic markets may mean greater price fluctuations. On the other hand, specific direct payments in organic farming result in greater income stability (Offermann & Nieberg, 2000). Some studies suggest that increased enterprise diversity on organic farms reduces risk, but often at the cost of lower expected returns (Hanson et al., 1990). A few surveys have been conducted about the types of risk perceived as most important by conventional farmers and about the management strategies used by farmers. US cash crop farmers were most concerned about commodity price risk, production risk, and changes in government laws and regulations (Harwood et al., 1999). Patrick and Musser (1997) analysed sources of and responses to risk among large-scale US cornbelt farmers. Costs and human aspects were perceived as the most important sources of risk. Liability insurance, financial and credit reserves, and debt management were identified as important risk responses. Martin (1996) identified important risk management strategies used by farmers and horticulturists in New Zealand. Price and weather risk were ranked as the most important risk sources among cash crop farmers. Routine spraying, enterprise diversification and keeping debt low were the chief management responses. Dutch livestock farmers considered price and production risks to be most important (Meuwissen et al., 2001). Producing at lowest possible costs and insurance were the most important risk management strategies. As far as we know, no earlier studies have compared conventional and organic cash crop farmers' risk perceptions and risk management strategies. In the Nordic countries, no studies at all have explicitly investigated cash crop farmers' risk perceptions and the ways they deal with the risks. This relative lack of information about (especially organic) farmers' risky environment and their reactions to it means that there are few useful practical guidelines for policy makers, farm advisers and researchers. The objectives of this exploratory study were, to provide empirical insight into: (i) Norwegian cash crop farmers' goals; (ii) their perceptions of risk and risk management responses; (iii) differences in risk perceptions and management responses between conventional and organic cash crop farmers; and (iv) farm and farmer characteristics related to these perceptions and strategies."}, {"section_title": "Data collection", "text": "The data were collected in a questionnaire survey of risk and risk management in Norwegian farming. Respondents were selected among Norwegian cash crop and dairy farmers. This article examines data from cash crop farms, including both specialized cash crop farms and mixed crop-livestock farms. Specialized cash crop farms were defined as having at least 1 ha grain, 0.5 ha potatoes, or 0.2 ha vegetables, fruits, or berries. Mixed crop-livestock farms should have at least 2.5 ha grain, 0.5 ha potatoes or 0.5 ha vegetables, fruits, or berries. Farms with dairy cows were excluded. The data from these farms are examined in Flaten et al. (2004). The questionnaire consisted of questions related to: (i) farm and farmer characteristics; (ii) the farmers' goals, future plans and motivations for choice of farming system, organic or conventional; (iii) the farmers' perceptions of risk, including risk attitude and sources of risk; and (iv) the farmers' perceptions of various risk management strategies. Most questions were of the closed type, many in the form of sevenpoint Likert scales (Pannell & Pannell, 1999). The questionnaire was pre-tested both internally and in a few sessions with farmers, and refined over several stages based on the comments and suggestions received. As a simple measure of farmers relative risk attitude 1 (Patrick & Musser, 1997;Meuwissen et al., 2001), the respondents were asked to what degree they perceived themselves to be more willing than others to take risk related to production, marketing and finance and investment. The answers to these three issues were on a scale from 1\u00c1/7, 1 indicating much less willing than others, and 7 indicating much more willing than others. From a list of 14 farming goals, the respondents were asked to select up to five goals as most important for them and to rank the importance of their selected goals. A total of 30 sources of risk and 25 risk management strategies relevant for cash crop farmers were presented to the respondents. Farmers were asked to score each source of risk on a Likert-scale from 1 (no impact) to 7 (very high impact) to express how significant they considered each source of risk to be in terms of its potential impact on the economic performance of their farm. Farmers indicated their perceived importance of each strategy on a Likertscale from 1 (not relevant) to 7 (very relevant). The Norwegian Agricultural Authority (SLF) has a register of farmers who receive support payments (i.e. all farmers in Norway), including each farm's stocking and cropping details. This data set (2002-data) was merged with the questionnaire survey data. The questionnaire was first sent out in January 2003 to the 611 randomly selected conventional cash crop farmers and all 212 registered cash crop farmers with some organic farmland. Farms with both conventional and organic production were classified as organic if more than 25% of the farmland was organic or in conversion to organic in accordance with national standards and laws for organic agriculture (Debio, 1998). Otherwise, they were classified as conventional farms. We were informed that 27 farmers of the ones that had received a questionnaire had quit farming. After a month, a reminder letter was posted, and in March a 1 More advanced methods to measure farmers' risk attitude are discussed in Hardaker et al. (2004) and Moschini and Hennessy (2000). new copy of the questionnaire was sent to farmers who had not yet responded. In total, 488 cash crop farmers (61%) returned a completed questionnaire. Not every respondent answered all questions."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "The responses on farming goals were reorganized by labelling a goal as important if it was selected and rated among the three most important by the farmer. Otherwise the goal was labelled less important . To compare organic and conventional farmers' ratings of various farming goals as important or less important, chi-square tests were used. Scores from the risk attitude questions were compared by t-tests. A simple factor analysis applied to variables measuring relative risk attitude resulted in one factor, indicating that the three risk willingness items to some degree measure the same underlying dimension. Hence we decided to generate a standardized risk index for each farmer by adding and standardizing the ratings. This risk index was used in regression analysis as a measure of the individual risk attitude. Farmers' perceptions of risk and risk management were initially examined by descriptive analyses. Mean values obtained in conventional and organic farming were compared by t -tests. Standard parametric statistical procedures were assumed appropriate for ordinal variables in the form of Likert-type scales (e.g. Patrick & Musser, 1997;Meuwissen et al., 2001). Principal component factor analysis (PCA) was used to summarize the information in a reduced number of factors and to generate factors that were as independent as possible for subsequent use in regressions. The latent root criterion (eigenvalue ]/1) was first used as a guideline to determine how many factors to extract. In order to have the most representative and parsimonious set of factors, factor solutions with different numbers of factors were also examined before the structures were defined (Hair et al., 1998). Orthogonal (varimax) rotation was used to obtain factor solutions that were easier to interpret. Standardized factor scores for each farmer and factor were saved for subsequent multiple regressions. Some 15 \u00c1/25% of the respondents did not answer one or more questions about sources of risk and risk management strategies. In such cases, the respondent was excluded if more than 33% of the variables for risk source or risk management strategies were missing. Less than 7% of the cases were excluded by this procedure. When only few questions had been left open, these data points were replaced with the mean value of that variable based on all valid responses. Because preliminary PCA analyses revealed very similar factor structures among risk sources and risk management strategies for conventional and organic farmers, joint factor analyses including both types of farmers were carried out. Multiple least squares regressions were used to study associations between farm and farmer characteristics, risk perceptions and risk management. We assumed a functional relationship between behaviour and manager characteristics and perceptions to exist (Van Raaij, 1981). We used this model of a firm's decision-making environment to specify the regressions. Simple correlation coefficients between all pairs of independent variables were low. Variance inflation factors were close to 1 and condition indices were low, indicating no multicollinearity problems (Belsley et al., 1980). Results obtained by the full model fitted (complete model), backward elimination, and the stepwise method were compared. The three approaches gave very similar estimates. We decided to work with the models obtained by the stepwise procedure. The criteria used for inclusion and exclusion were set to P B/0.10 and P /0.15, respectively. All statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS (v 11.5.1) for Windows."}, {"section_title": "Results and discussion", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Key characteristics of respondents and farms", "text": "Most of the farmland on conventional farms was used to produce grain and oil seeds (Table 1). Organic farmers had less farmland but more animals than the conventional farmers. Organic farms used more than one third of the farmland to produce forage, which is necessary to achieve a high share of farm-grown fodder. Organic farmers had more education, and more of them had specific agricultural training. Most respondents were organized as family farms: 97% of the conventional and 93% of the organic farms. Joint operations occurred more frequently on organic farms (3.7%) than on conventional farms (1.6%). Nearly 4% of the organic farms were schools, institutions, other forms of co-operation or were leased, whereas less than 1% of the conventional cash crop farms belonged to these categories. Table 2 shows the percentage of conventional and organic farmers rating various farm goals as important, and whether the ratings by conventional and organic farmers differed significantly."}, {"section_title": "Important goals for farmers", "text": "As listed in Table 2, conventional farmers ranked the goal reliable and stable income first, producing high Risk management in Norwegian cash crop farming quality food second, and prosperity, living quality for children, time for family third on average. The highest ranked goal for organic farmers was sustainable and environment-friendly farming , rated as important by 54%. Ranked second was producing high quality food and third reliable and stable income. As often found in studies of farmers' goals, profit maximization ranked rather low (e.g. Gasson et al., 1988;Willock et al., 1999;Bergevoet et al., 2004), and lower among organic farmers. Our results support earlier studies that farm-ers choose to convert to organic farming for a number of reasons in addition to financial ones (e.g. Padel & Lampkin, 1994a)."}, {"section_title": "Perceptions of relative risk attitude", "text": "Organic farmers on average felt that they were more willing to take risk relative to others than did conventional farmers (Table 3). With particular respect to production and marketing, organic farmers tended to rate their risk-taking willingness as higher than conventional farmers. So far, there are few organic farmers and the experience with this form of production is limited. A cropping system trial in Norway showed that the average grain yields of barley in organic cash crop systems were 66% of the conventional barley yields (Kerner, 1994;Eltun & Nordheim, 1999), and there is evidence for greater variability in crop yields and prices with organic than with conventional farming (Padel & Lampkin, 1994b). Some willingness to take risk should therefore be expected among those adopting organic farming practices. Gardebroek (2002) found organic farmers to be less risk averse than their conventional colleagues."}, {"section_title": "Perceptions of risk sources", "text": "Crop price variability and crop yield variability stand out as the two top-rated sources of risk in both groups (Table 4). Price and production risks were also ranked very highly in previous surveys of crop farmers (Boggess et al., 1985;Martin, 1996;Patrick & Musser, 1997). Other highly ranked risks in this study were changes in government support payments and changes in consumer preferences. Moreover, some other institutional risks, especially tax policy, had high ratings. For dairy farmers in Norway, both conventional and organic, uncertainty about the continuation of general government support payments and milk price variability stood out as the top-rated sources of risk, while milk yield variability scored low (Flaten et al., 2004). In Norway, target prices and support schemes are determined in annual negotiations between the two farmers' unions and the government. Domestic farmgate prices are usually much higher than world market prices. High average rankings related to crop prices may thus be related to farm policy. The high scores for the importance of institutional risks may be related to somewhat unpredictable and frequent changes of Norwegian farm policies and regulations, together with external pressures for deregulation and fears of farm support cuts. Institutional risks are not only restricted to Norway. Risk connected to changes in the subsidy system and the abandonment of price supports for farmers is important both in the United States and the European Union (Klair et al., 1998). Organic cash crop farmers ranked three specific organic off-farm sources of risk (additional organic farming payments, price premiums on organic products, and organic farming laws and regulations ) significantly higher than conventional farmers. High scores for external organic risk sources may reduce the growth in the area of cropland under organic management. Organic farmers' higher ranking of marketing and sale may reflect the higher instability in organic product markets. Having in mind that 56% of the organic respondents had a mixed crop-livestock operation, in contrast to 22% for the conventional ones, it is not surprising that many sources of risk related to livestock and forage production had much more importance for organic farmers. Organic farmers particularly attached less importance to such sources of risk as costs of operating inputs, costs of capital equipment , and crop price variability. The finding that organic farmers ranked input cost risk lower than conventional farmers is probably due to the use of production systems in organic farming with low levels of purchased inputs. Sources of risk that scored low for both groups included hired labour, family relationships, credit availability, and leasing farm land . Of the 30 presented sources of risk, 22 were related to cash crop farming. A factor analysis on these 22 sources, using principal component extraction combined with a varimax rotation, resulted in 6 factors with an eigenvalue greater than 1. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure for the entire set of variables was 0.815, suggesting the matrix was suitable for factor analysis. The Measure of Sampling Adequacy (MSA) and the communalities for each variable were satisfactory. The six-factor solution gave the most interpretable factors and was judged to be most useful. These factors explained 64.4% of the total variation, a satisfactory amount in social sciences (Hair et al., 1998). Table 4 displays the six factors and their respective loading items, excluding those for which the absolute value of the loadings was less than 0.30. The factors 1 to 6 were labelled institutional , external organic , human resources, credit , crop, and market , respectively. Factor 1, named institutional , had 1 Farmers' assessment of their willingness to take risk on a scale from 1 (do not agree) to 7 (fully agree). The statements were ''I am willing to take more risk than others with respect to: (1) production; (2) marketing; and (3) finance and investment'', respectively. 2 Mean numbers marked with asterisks show that the mean scores of conventional and organic farmers are significantly different at *P B/0.05, **P B/0.01 and ***P B/ 0.001, based on independent samples t-test. high loadings from public payment and government variables, and input prices. The three specific external risks for organic farming loaded extremely on factor 2, labelled external organic . Factor 3, human resources, includes both health risk of the operator and the family, uncertainty about the family, technical failure, and fire. Factor 4 has high loadings from credit costs and availability and was called credit . Crop prices and crop yield variability loaded strongly on factor 5, labelled crop. Factor 6, market , involves significant loadings of changes in consumer preferences, marketing and sale."}, {"section_title": "Perceptions of risk management strategies", "text": "Organic and conventional farmers rated management strategies more similarly than they rated the sources of risk (Table 5). For both groups of cash crop farmers, good liquidity was the top rated strategy. The 1996 USDA Agricultural Resource Management Survey also found that keeping cash on hand was the number one strategy, independent of farm size, commodity speciality, and region (Harwood et al., 1999). The next most highly ranked strategy for both types of Norwegian farmers was prevent and reduce crop diseases and pests, followed by buying farm business insurance, and producing at lowest possible costs. For Norwegian dairy farmers Flaten et al. (2004) found the same top ranking, except that prevent and reduce crop diseases and pests was replaced with prevent and reduce liveestock diseases. Dairy farmers, compared to cash-crop farmers, considered off-farm work as a less important strategy to cope with risk. For organic cash crop farmers product and market flexibility, and enterprise diversification were significantly more important than for conventional farmers. These findings may result from the smaller volume of organic markets with greater price fluctuations and from the likelihood that the interactions between enterprises are important for the overall financial performance of an organic farm (Padel & Lampkin, 1994b). Conventional farmers attached particularly greater importance than organic farmers to solvency, debt management and off-farm investments. These results may be related to the lower emphasis on 'economic goals' among organic farmers. Less important strategies for farmers in general were, in declining order, keeping fixed costs low, storage, use of both economic and veterinarian consultants and services, surplus machinery capacity, offfarm investments, and organize the farm as a corporation . The bottom rating strategy of corporate farming indicated that most farmers did not consider this as suitable for reducing risk. A joint factor analysis applied to 22 of the 25 presented risk management strategies resulted in seven factors with eigenvalue above 1. Two items were excluded because they related to livestock production, and one because it had low loadings on all of the extracted factors. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure for the whole set of variables was 0.796, which means that the variables were suitable for factor analysis. The MSA and communalities for each variable were satisfactory. The factor loadings for the individual variables are shown in Table 5. The seven factors explained 57% of the total variation in the 22 variables. The structure was more complicated than for the risk perceptions. The first factor, business, includes general business risk reducing methods; the most important are consultancy, storage, contracting , and diversification . The next factor, named flexibility, has high loadings on product, market, and asset flexibility and diversification. Both farm business and personal insurance dominates the factor insurance. High loadings from the strategy to produce at lowest possible cost gave the name to factor 4, low cost , which also includes preventing or reducing crop diseases and pests. Factor 5, financial , includes mainly solvency, debt management , liquidity \u00c1/ keeping cash on hand, and off-farm work . Keeping fixed costs low, labelled factor 6, fix cost . Investing off-farm and keeping surplus machinery capacity are strategies that help to manage risk, mainly by investing money. Therefore factor 7 was labelled invest ."}, {"section_title": "Perception of risk sources in relation to farm and farmer characteristics", "text": "Stepwise regressions were used to assess the associations of the risk perception factors with the independent variables (Table 6). Institutional sources of risk were less important for farmers with high leverage and low degree of risk aversion. Farmers' rating of institutional sources of risk was positively related to the proportion of grain area on the farm. This may be a result of a higher degree of governmental intervention in Norwegian grain farming than in the horticultural sector. The external organic factor was of course a main source of risk for organic farmers, but was less important for farmers with livestock production and those with a higher proportion of vegetables or fruits. This may indicate that farmers perceived organic regulations and premiums in Norway as more risky for pure cash crop farming (except vegetables and fruits) than for mixed crop-livestock production. This may be a reason for why few pure cash crop farmers convert to organic agriculture in Norway. The same has been reported from other countries (Schneeberger et al., 2002). Risks linked to human resources were less important for farmers with no spouse. A total high farm-income and off-farm work helped to reduce this source of risk, whereas farmers with secondary school education were more aware of this. Leveraged farmers were, as expected, particularly aware of risk related to credit , the same was found for large-sized farms (measured as hectares farmland). Education above secondary school level tended to reduce the concern for risk connected to credit . Organic farmers were less concerned with these types of risk. Crop risks were especially important to farmers with a higher proportion of grain, vegetables or fruits. Market risks were of high importance for high farm-income respondents, for those with higher education, and farmers who were less risk averse. Farmers with more grain production felt less exposed to market risks. All regressions were highly significant at P B/0.05. The goodness of fit measure for some of the factors indicated that the variables used were either not very suitable to explain the variation or that farmers' perception of these risks were very farmer specific."}, {"section_title": "Risk management strategies in relation to farm and farmer characteristics", "text": "The estimated relationships between farm and farmer characteristics, sources of risk and risk management strategies, analysed through stepwise regression, are presented in Table 7. Farmers with lots of land and those with an agricultural education more frequently assigned importance to the business risk management strategies. The difference was significant. A large proportion of vegetables or fruits and the goal to produce high quality food were positively related to this factor. Profit-maximizing farmers and single farmers perceived the business strategies as being less important. Flexibility seems to be of less importance with increasing age of the farmer and of higher importance with decreasing degree of risk aversion. Leveraged farmers perceived insurance as more important. More risk averse farmers seemed to be more interested in buying insurance. The low-cost strategy was preferred by farmers with high income from farming, with a high leverage, and of older age. The importance of the financial strategy was higher for farmers with off-farm work and a higher proportion of grain, but it was perceived as less important for farmers with high farm income, secondary school education , and agricultural education . To be aware of fixed cost was associated with higher education, off-farm work, and off-farm investments. The strategy invest was highly rated by farmers who had invested off-farm, who had a total high income, those with a large proportion of grain area, and those who were less risk averse. Organic farmers were less concerned about the invest strategy. Institutional risk was positively related to the low cost strategy and financial management responses. External organic risk sources were positively related to business and flexibility responses, but negatively to the low cost strategy. Both human resources and credit risk led farmers to the invest strategy. The rated importance of business strategies was related to the perceived impact of risk factors labelled credit , crop and market . In addition, low cost and financial strategies were well known to handle crop risks. Many different strategies were related to market risks. In addition to earlier mentioned strategies there were positive associations between market risk and the strategies flexibility, insurance and financial . All regressions were highly significant at P B/0.05. The goodness of fit measure for some of the factors indicate that the variables used were either not very suitable to explain the variation or that farmers' perception of these risks were very farmer specific."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "The objective of this study was to obtain empirical insight into cash crop farmers' perception of risk and risk management strategies. A questionnaire survey was carried out among Norwegian farmers. The survey results indicate that organic farmers ranked sustainable and environmental friendly farming as goal number one; they focused less on economic goals. By contrast, the top goal for conventional farmers was to achieve a reliable and stable income. Organic farmers perceived themselves to be less risk averse than their conventional colleagues. Crop prices and yield variability were the two top rated risk sources for both groups of farmers. In general, institutional sources of risk were perceived as important. While conventional farmers ranked sources of risk linked to costs of purchased inputs higher, organic farmers were more aware of external organic sources such as additional organic farming payments, The variables formal agricultural education, age of farmer, household income, off-farm investment in the last five years, % potatoes of farmland, and region were tested in the models but found to be not significant. 3 A simple measure of risk attitude.

The two groups of farmers evaluated risk management strategies more similarly. Favoured strategies were good liquidity, preventing and reducing crop diseases and pests, different forms of insurance and low cost production. For organic farmers, product flexibility and enterprise diversification were perceived to be more important. Conventional farmers rated solvency and off-farm investment higher. Different sources of risk and risk management strategies were related to socio-economic variables. The results indicate that farmers perceived organic regulations and premiums in Norway as more risky for pure cash crop farming (except vegetables and fruits) than for mixed crop-livestock production. The strongest associations were found between credit risk and highly leveraged farmers, and between market risks and high farm income. Of the management responses, financial and working off-farm were strongly related. Because of the sampling method used, the results can be taken to be representative for organic and conventional cash crop farmers in Norway. The high support payments and high degree of regulation of agriculture in Norway obviously influences our results. Nevertheless, the agricultural policy system and regulations for farming practices are not very different from what is found in some other developed countries across the Northern Hemisphere. This implies that similar results also might be found in several other countries. The study revealed notable differences between organic and conventional cash crop farmers' risk perceptions and priorities for ways to handle risk, suggesting that government policies may have to be applied differently to the groups. Both groups of farmers were, however, worried about the institutional risks, indicating the importance of an agricultural policy that is clear, stable and predictable. Policy makers should therefore be cautious about changing policy capriciously and they should consider strategic policy initiatives that give farmers more long-term reliability. One step in a more stable and predictable direction in Norway would be a change from annual to perennial agricultural negotiations between the farmers' unions and the government. Since the questionnaire showed that several risk factors are of importance for crop farmers, those dealing with them ought to provide better information to enable them to make better-informed judgements about the risks they face. Farm management consultants and advisers should make more use of modern decision analysis tools that incorporate the main sources of risk."}]
