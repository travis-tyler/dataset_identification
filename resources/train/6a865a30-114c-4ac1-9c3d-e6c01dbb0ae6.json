Institutional \"investors\" are back in business in global currency markets. With their resurgence, countries are again facing huge inflows of hot money that cannot be put to any productive use, but which create severe price Global Monetary Chaos: Systemic Failures Need Bold Multilateral Responses misalignments and trade distortions. The global \"casino\", nearly empty a year ago, is crowded again, and many new bets are on the table. However, the recovery in the real economy is modest at best. In fact, the rebound of stocks, commodity futures and currency trade in several emerging and developing economies since March 2009 displays the makings of highly correlated big new bubbles and the threat of a new round of financial crisis. Of even greater concern is that the crisis notwithstanding, faith in \"market fundamentalism\" is unswerving. That faith continues to sustain the na\u00efve belief that a solution to misalignment may be found by leaving the determination of exchange rates to unregulated financial markets. The effects of the new exuberance on financial markets are adverse for countries with once-fragile currencies, such as Brazil, Hungary and Turkey. Exploiting the differentials between interest rates, the socalled currency carry trade in these countries and in the big financial markets of the North has become even easier today. Rates in the North are generally close to zero, whereas maintaining \"confidence\" in countries with weaker currencies -under the aegis of IMF programmes since the onset of the crisis -has called for higher rates than before. The first results of the new \"confidence\" in weak currencies are ominous. An appreciation of the Brazilian real and the Hungarian forint has forestalled urgently needed gains in competitiveness and could again lead to severe overvaluation, a dramatic distortion of trade patterns and new imbalances. Recent actions taken by some developing economies, such as Brazil, to intervene in foreign exchange markets have to be evaluated in light of the dramatic failure of the currency markets to get the prices right. Re-imposing a 2% tax on purchases by foreign investors of real-denominated fixed-income securities and stocks, for example, is not a market unfriendly policy. Rather, such measures serve to safeguard the efficiency of markets for goods and services by protecting their prices from becoming a punching ball of financial market prices, which are driven by an undifferentiated (if not irrational) appetite for risk. In the brave new world of liberalized global trade and finance, the treasuries of sovereign governments of the largest developing economies -and even some developed countries -can be seriously challenged by the power of financial flows. And in the absence of a truly multilateral exchange rate system, each country naturally pursues whatever works best in the circumstances. In fact, as a response to the current global crisis that originated elsewhere, China has done more than any other emerging economy to stimulate domestic demand, and as a result its import volume has expanded significantly. Private consumption is rising at breakneck speed. According to several estimates, Chinese private consumption increased by 9% in real terms in 2009, which dwarfs other major countries' attempts to revive their domestic markets. But even in the preceding decade, real private consumption, at an average 8% growth rate, was an important driver of growth, backed by wage and salary increases in the two-digit range and strong productivity growth. Unit labour costs (nominal compensation divided by UNCTAD productivity) are rising more there than elsewhere, resulting in a continuous loss in competitive power even with a fixed exchange rate. Expecting that China will leave its exchange rate to the mercy of totally unreliable markets and risk a Japan-like appreciation shock ignores the importance of its domestic and external stability for the region and for the globe."}, {"section_title": "Reforming global exchange rate governance", "text": "It is time to break with a sterile polemic that ignores the increasing evidence from a range of experiences showing that both absolutely fixed/pegged and fully flexible/floating exchange rate systems are suboptimal. These so-called \"corner solutions\" have added to volatility and uncertainty and aggravated the global imbalances. With this as a starting point, the debate can move forward to explore new common formulas for exchange rate management that increase consistency between trade and financial flows in a globalized economy. In order to address global imbalances coherently, governments need to act in the same spirit of multilateralism that characterized the international fiscal response to the crisis at its most critical moments in 2008. A coherent approach to restoring balanced trade calls for policies that address and prevent currency speculation at the global level. Even those who criticize governments for stabilizing exchange rates and intervening in financial markets generally recognize that a viable long-term solution to the problem of massive trade distortions and global imbalances cannot be expected from individual central banks trying to find a unilateral solution to a multilateral problem like the exchange rate. The World Trade Organization was established to help countries coordinate and manage the multilateral trading system, and the Basle Accords set global standards for banking. But the global monetary system has no such agreed regulatory system for enabling trading partners to avoid distortions stemming from financial shocks and, most importantly, exchange rate misalignments. Such a framework for limiting the degree of exchange rate deviations from the fundamentals would provide the missing link in dealing with the crucial but neglected source of imbalance and instability in the globalized economy.

Needless to say, introducing the CRER rule would call for major political commitments and be fraught with technical difficulties that would have to be hammered out. To get such a scheme off the ground, indepth analysis would be needed to identify the level at which real exchange rates could be fixed with the least possible friction. This is, however, feasible if the political will exists to put international trade on a rational basis. Such a rule could include giving more flexibility and exemptions to LDCs in the case of idiosyncratic shocks and lasting structural weaknesses. In conclusion, the CRER rule goes further than instruments that focus on national taxation of capital flows, on the unconditional provision of international support in times of crisis, or on simply throwing sand on the \"greasy\" wheels of the financial system to decelerate the pace of speculation. With an explicit exchange rate rule, the problem is dealt with at source by removing the incentives for speculation.

Infrastructural deficiencies (e.g., unreliable power and water supply, transportation, communication, poor governance, inhospitable regulatory environments, work ethic) in Africa are well known. This explains why foreign multinational enterprises (MNEs) in general, let alone China's, have not yet seriously advanced into the continent in search of low-cost labor. The governments of the Asian NIEs quickly realized the potential of Japanese and Western FDI and thus were prepared to provide relevant infrastructure, particularly special economic zones (SEZs). Since 2006, as part of its strategy to assist sub-Saharan Africa in attracting manufacturing, China has been helping establish SEZs, a scheme modeled on its own SEZs. Currently, the Chinese SEZ in Zambia serves as a model for such zones in Africa. At the moment, nevertheless, there exists China's tendency toward ethnicity-bound groupism, as evidenced in the employment of Chinese construction workers in large numbers for aid projects, the settlement of Chinese migrants and petty merchants/caterers in host countries and the one-sided presence of Chinese consortia for overseas investments without much participation of local and other countries' MNEs. In contrast, Asia's SEZs succeeded in hosting not only foreign MNEs but many local firms as well, and host governments took proactive measures to use their SEZs as a learning conduit for modern technology and advanced business practices, a situation not yet commonly observable in sub-Saharan Africa.

Although empirical research tends on balance to corroborate this view, it is not well known whether the FDI productivity benefits to the host country are sensitive to the country sources of investment (home country) or the nationality/ownership of the foreign affiliates. If this happens to be the case, then some studies which aggregate all FDI or foreign-owned firms may miss differential impacts of country sources, and indeed it may be that 'good' and 'bad' countries or regions discount one another, leading to no overall significant effect. This paper contributes to the literature on host-country productivity impacts of inward direct investment by examining whether FDI from different countries or regions has a differential impact on the productivity growth in Canada. Using industry panel data, the regression analysis shows that the country of origin matters. More specifically, the FDI originated from the US has a significant positive impact on TFP growth in industries in which it operates, while the FDIs from European and other regions have no significant impact. These findings are consistent with both higher productivity of the US-owned firms and technological knowledge spillovers from the US to Canada. They are also in line with some previous studies which report that the US domestic R&D spillovers to Canada are much larger than the spillovers from major European countries. Moreover, our results also show that foreign investment from the US generates positive productivity spillovers to Canadian-owned firms within the same industries. These overall results accord with the findings from other countries' studies that explored the productivity differentials of inward FDI across the home countries. These existing studies report that the US-owned firms or US MNEs tend to outperform both domestically owned firms and non-US MNEs. An interesting topic for future research would be to explore in details why the productivity impacts of inward FDI differ across the country of origin.

Thus, these retailers' success may depend increasingly on employing market-oriented strategies to respond well to consumer demands. This study is the first to investigate (a) the effects of environmental uncertainty from market turbulence and competitive intensity on South Korean apparel retailers' performance and market-oriented strategies, and (b) the effects of the retailers' market-oriented strategies on their performance. Previous research on the relationships investigated in this study has focused largely on Western businesses and rarely on retailing. Kohli and Jaworski (1990) \nDramatic improvements in productivity, driven by huge innovations, have resulted in substantial reductions in the prices of information and communication technologies (ICTs). These large reductions in relative prices have, in turn, resulted in a big increase in the adoption and use of ICTs in all countries in the last three decades, including Canada. These trends have accelerated since 1990. The increased use of ICTs has been credited with the strong resurgence of labour productivity growth in the U.S. and many other OECD countries between 1995 and 2000. 1 However, more recent data show that productivity growth since 2000 has been very weak in Europe and Canada, significantly lower than the average growth rate during 1981-2000. * The views expressed in this paper are those of the authors, and do not reflect in any way those of either Industry Canada or the Government of Canada. Growth in labour productivity (real GDP per hour worked) in the U.S. business sector, on the other hand, has actually accelerated since 2000, having been significantly better than the average annual growth rate during 1981-2000. The available research suggests that the service sector has been the dominant source of labour productivity growth revival in the U.S. There seems to be a consensus among economists that the increased use of ICTs, especially in the service sector, played a major role in the acceleration of U.S. labour productivity growth. The interesting research question is: what role did ICTs play in the divergent productivity performance in Canada and the U.S.? There seems to be disagreement among researchers about the role of ICTs in the recent productivity growth performance of OECD countries and the channels through which they might be impacting labour productivity growth. Some argue that ICTs influence labour productivity growth primarily through the capital deepening effect -substitution of capital for labour. Others suggest that ICTs act as generalpurpose technologies (GPTs). Hence, in addition to raising the capital-labour ratio, they also increase the productivity of all other inputs -raising multifactor productivity (MFP) growth. 2 Some others counter this argument by noting that firms increasing investments in ICTs also raise investments in intangibles such as workplace reorganization, marketing, branding, etc., which are hard to measure, to maximize the benefits of investments in ICTs. Therefore, a good part of the increase in measured MFP growth might be simply due to the increase in unmeasured co-investments. Some researchers also argue that ICTs generate significant productivity spillovers via network effects. 3 Consequently, social rates of return on ICT investments could exceed private rates of return by a significant margin. The main objective of this paper, using panel data on industries, is to empirically examine the impact of ICTs on MFP growth in Canada and the U.S., controlling for the influence of other factors such as non-ICT M&E capital, R&D, human capital and industry-fixed and time effects. In addition, we take into account the influence of ICT-related investments in intangibles. We proxy this variable by the purchases of commercial business services by each industry. We also address the difficult empirical issue of endogeneity of explanatory variables. In this paper, however, we do not explicitly address the issue of spillovers. Our research findings suggest that ICTs do not significantly impact MFP growth in Canada or the U.S. On the other hand, ICT-related co-investment in intangibles is an important determinant of MFP growth in Canada. Similarly, R&D intensity and human capital positively impact MFP growth in Canada. These results are robust for the full sample as well as for goods-producing industries specifically. On the other hand, non-ICT M&E capital positively affects MFP growth in the U.S. These results imply that ICT capital could not have played a role in the post-2000 labour productivity growth divergence between Canada and the U.S. via the MFP growth channel. However, it could have contributed to the widening of the Canada-U.S. labour productivity gap via the capital deepening channel, because of faster growth in the ICT capital-labour ratio in the U.S. 4\nThere is a large and growing empirical literature assessing the impact of inward foreign direct investment (FDI) on the host-country's productivity performance. Although there are somewhat conflicting results, the literature tends to suggest on balance that FDI (or foreign affiliate/multinational enterprise (MNE)) 1 leads to increased productivity in the recipient countries. There are several ways in which inward FDI or the entrance/existence of foreign firms might improve productivity in the host countries where they operate. First, as a result of their alleged superior knowledge (e.g. managerial expertise and superior technological capabilities), foreign affiliates might exhibit higher * The views expressed in this paper are those of the authors and do not reflect those of Industry Canada or the Government of Canada. The authors would like to thank Someshwar Rao and Walid Hejazi for insightful comments and suggestions. 1 A transnational investment is typically classified as direct investment if a foreign investor holds at least 10% of a local firm's voting equity; and a foreign affiliate is a business in which there is FDI. As for a foreign-controlled/owned firm, it entails the ownership of a majority (50% or more) of the voting equity in a firm. A MNE is a company that owns and controls firms in at least two countries. In practice, however, a large proportion of FDI involves majority-owned firms. For instance, Statistics Canada reports that majority-owned firms accounted for over 90% of Canada's inward FDI stock in 2005. In this paper, we use the terms FDI, foreign affiliate and MNE interchangeably. Inward FDI and Productivity Performance in Canadian Industries productivity than domestically-owned firms. Therefore, an increasing share of foreign affiliates among the total population of firms within an industry will raise the average productivity in that industry. Second, the presence of FDI in any particular industry might have a positive spillover effect on the productivity of domestic firms within the same industry. The domestic firms benefit from foreign affiliates' knowledge or technological skills, and therefore improve their productivity. This is referred to intra-industry spillovers in the literature. The third channel suggests that a given domestic industry may also enhance its productivity from the presence of FDI in other related industries (both upstream and downstream industries However, largely because of data limitations, there has been little emphasis on whether these aforementioned (potential) productivity impacts of FDI in the recipient country depend on the FDI's country of origin. In fact, one might incline to believe that the contributions of FDI from different countries may differ significantly due to substantial differences in the sophistication of technology/knowledge, managerial practices, motives and strategic approaches across countries of origin. For example, many observers contend that Japanese MNEs behave differently from other MNEs, because of their protected domestic base, industrial pattern, or because they have different culture and institutional structure (see, e.g., Graham and Krugman, 1995). A case in point is that Japanese FDI generally enters labour-intensive industries producing standardized products, while the US MNEs usually operate in most technologically sophisticated industries that are more capital-intensive in nature (see Ozawa (1972), Kim et al. (2003), Banga (2004) Globerman, Ries and Vertinsky (1994), the knowledge of whether the home country of a foreign affiliate affects the benefits of FDI to the host country may help to target more effectively a country's promotion efforts to attract FDI and maximize its benefits from potential inward investments. The rest of the paper is organized in the following way. Section 2 documents some facts about the characteristics and performance of FDI in Canada. Section 3 reviews some existing empirical evidences on the productivity differentials across country sources of FDI. Section 4 describes the empirical models and the measurements and sources of data used in this paper. The empirical estimation results are presented in Section 5. Section 6 concludes the paper. 2\uff0eFacts about FDI in Canada: characteristics and performance As shown in Figure 2, both Canada's inward and outward FDI stocks have increased steadily from 1987 to 2007. However, with an increase by about 7 times during 1987-2007, outward FDI stock from Canada grew faster than inward stock (increasing by about 5 times). Since 1997, Canada has been a net outward Inward FDI and Productivity Performance in Canadian Industries investor. In 2007, the net direct investment position (the difference between CDIA and FDI in Canada) was about $14 billion, significantly down from $92 billion a year earlier. The United States continues to be the dominant foreign investor in Canada (Table 1). In 2007, the US accounted for 58% of Canada's inward FDI stock (down from 67.2% in 1995). The United Kingdom was the second highest source of FDI in Canada with about 11% (which is slightly up from 8.4% in 1995). These two countries combined with the Netherlands, France, and Switzerland held just over 81% of FDI in Canada in 2007. Other European countries, Japan and Brazil were also among the top 10 sources. The industrial distribution of Canadian inward FDI stock (Table 2) indicates that in 2007 three industries, namely finance and insurance, energy, and metallic minerals & metal products, accounted for about 51% of the total stock of FDI in Canada. This proportion was up from 35% in 1995, and 42% in 2002. Between 2002 and 2007, the highest decline in share was observed in the food, beverage and tobacco and transportation equipment industry, falling about 5 and 4 percentage points, respectively. Are there any differences in the asset turnover performance of inward FDI in Canada from different countries? Also, how is this performance measure of inward FDI compared with that of Canadian-owned firms? The asset turnover is defined as the ratio of operating revenue by total asset. It measures the efficiency of an asset in generating revenue (i.e. how much sales can be generated per unit dollar of asset). The data are collected by Corporations Returns Act (CRA) and are available from Statistics Canada.

These authors expand such findings to show that capital account liberalization only works for those nations above a certain threshold of economic and institutional development (Saluka, 2006).

As noted in the full subcommitee report, the IMF and others have raised concerns that efforts to restructure sovereign debt may give rise to investor-state claims. New model investment provisions should not obstruct global efforts to set up adequate facilities for sovereign debt restructuring that could be undermined if bondholders are able to circumvent such mechanisms by filing claims under BITs. At minimum, the model BIT should codify U.S.-Peru FTA-like provisions that limit an investor's ability to bring an investor-state claim based on a debt restructuring where holders of 75% or more of the outstanding debt have agreed to the restructuring.

In 2007, about one-fifth of all foreign-controlled assets in Canada were in the primary sector, a disproportionately large share compared to its contribution to Canada's GDP, increasingly concentrated in the oil and gas and other mining industries. The shares of these two industries in foreign controlled assets rose by almost four percentage points between 2000 and 2007. The share of foreign controlled assets in the manufacturing sector, in comparison, declined from 33% in 2000 to 25% in 2008. The share of foreign assets in the service sector has remained more or less constant at 18%, and is concentrated predominantly in the wholesale, retail, real estate, renting, and leasing industries. A list of the top 20 largest foreign companies operating in Canada (ranked by revenue) is provided in annex table 5. Among them, two are operating in the energy (oil and gas) and the metals and mining industries; three in the automobile industry; two in computer services; and one in the IT service industry. There were 60 mega-deals (value of US$ 1 billion or more) with a combined value of US$ 275 billion announced in 2007 alone, a record high in terms of both volume and value. Of the total value of announced deals that year, 78% was cross-border in nature; all of the ten largest deals had an international component. The value of foreign-led acquisitions, the largest of which was worth US$ 48 billion (BCE) (annex table 6), surpassed the acquisitions by Canadians in foreign countries by a 2-to-1 margin. The pace of cross-border M&A activity declined dramatically in 2008 however, falling to less than one-third of its 2007 value.

In particular, when guidelines were introduced in 2007, the ICA did not include a national security review power. However, the recent amendments have added a stand-alone national security review test to the ICA. This test is separate from the net benefit test that is generally applicable to reviewable investments under the ICA, and applies to a much broader range of proposed transactions. The national security test subjects investments that \"impair or threaten to impair national security\" to Ministerial and potentially Cabinet review, though no definition of what constitutes \"national security\" is given in the ICA or the regulations made thereto. 6 However, it is possible that investments impacting Canada's sovereignty, national defense and potentially strategic sectors of the economy (such as natural resources), and investments by stateowned enterprises may be considered under the national security test. Concerns have been raised that the test has the potential to be used as a tool for protectionism, given the high level of discretion provided to the Government.

Like other developed countries, cross-border M&As into Canada, and hence inward FDI flows, were hit hard by the financial crisis and recession. The outlook for inward FDI in 2010 and beyond looks promising because of the expected expansion of the Canadian and other economies, the improved situation in global financial markets and increased demand for resources. Canada still has higher barriers to inward FDI compared to many developed countries in key services industries. Any progress on this front would be expected further to increase FDI in Canada.\nCanada has been a net exporter of FDI since 1996, with approximately half of its OFDI destined for the \nThe main objectives of this paper have been to examine inter-industry variations in MFP growth over time in Canada and the U.S, and to analyze the main reasons for the differences across industries and over time, with a focus on the impact of ICT capital on MFP growth. Towards this objective, we developed an empirical model to address the issues of investment in intangible assets as well as the endogeneity of 19 There is almost no difference in the estimation results between the fourth and fifth order approximation. 20 We also run the same regression as in Table 1 using data on 23 goods industries only. The regression results are similar to the full sample estimates, except the coefficient on the human capital variable becomes statistically insignificant. 21 Stiroh (2002b) shows no evidence that ICT investment by firms generates externalities in U.S. manufacturing industries. Triplett & Bosworth (2004) find no support for ICT externalities in U.S. service industries. Harchaoui and Tarkhani (2005) find no evidence of ICT externalities for Canada. Note, however, that Fuss and Waverman (2005), in a cross-country growth regression based on an endogenous growth model, find that the ICT capital gap accounted for 55% of the Canada-U.S. productivity gap in 2003, mainly because of externalities. The results of that paper raise numerous questions and need further validation. explanatory variables. Using time-series data (1987)(1988)(1989)(1990)(1991)(1992)(1993)(1994)(1995)(1996)(1997)(1998)(1999)(2000) on 33 Canadian and U.S. industries, we estimated empirically the impact of ICT capital on MFP growth in Canada and the U.S. The following are the key findings: \u2212 ICT capital has not contributed to inter-industry differences in MFP growth in Canada or the U.S.; \u2212 Investments in intangible assets, R&D intensity and human capital play a significant role in MFP growth in Canada, but are not important factors in the U.S; and \u2212 On the other hand, non-ICT M&E capital intensity positively impacts MFP growth in the U.S., but not in Canada. These results imply that ICT capital could not have contributed to the post-2000 divergence in labour productivity growth in Canada and the U.S. via the MFP channel. However, it might have contributed somewhat to the widening of the Canada-U.S. labour productivity gap via the capital deepening route because of faster growth in ICT capital intensity in the U.S. On the other hand, our results suggest that non-ICT M&E capital intensity could have contributed to the widening of the productivity gap via both the MFP and the capital deepening channels. These results, however, need be used with caution. The data used for the empirical analysis are at an aggregate industry level. Hence, it is quite possible that this level of aggregation will not allow us to capture very well the MFP impact of ICT capital.

The sustained competitiveness of firms operating in environments undergoing rapid change requires that the firms anticipate changes and be prepared to adapt business activities accordingly (Johnston, Gilmore, and Carson 2008). Davis, Morris, and Allen (1991) found a positive relationship between perceived environmental dynamism and firms' MO level. Kohli and Jaworski (1990) noted that the competitiveness of a firm's operating environment is positively related to the likelihood the firm would be market oriented. McKitterick (1957) emphasized that firms operating in competitive environments must recognize and respond to customer needs or face rivals that develop products to meet those needs and capture the firms' business. Indeed, firms operating in highly competitive markets tend to be sensitive and responsive to customer needs (Lusch and Laczniak 1987). Pelham and Wilson (1996) concluded, however, that some situations do not demand MO strategies after finding no effect of market dynamism and competitive intensity on the degree of MO among small firms. In addition, antecedents to MO in one country may neither foster nor hinder firms' MO in others (Burgess and Nyajeka, 2006). We hypothesized (H1) positive effects of market turbulence and competitive intensity on each of four components of market orientation (i.e., intelligence generation, intelligence dissemination, response design, and response implementation), partly because Davis et al. (1991) argued that environmental changes not only create need for entrepreneurial and market orientations, but also motivate firms to adopt these orientations. Features of the external environment, including the state of the economy, competitive intensity, and market turbulence, have been found to affect business performance (Miller and Toulouse, 1986;Peterson, 1985). Power and Reid (2003) found that market turbulence negatively affects the performance of longlived small firms. Nickell, Nicolotsas, and Dryen (1997) showed that firm performance is negatively related to market turbulence, but positively related to the degree of competition in the firm's market. Januszewsik, Koke, and Winter (1999) observed that enterprises in intensely competitive markets tend to exhibit high growth in productivity. On the basis of the literature, we hypothesized that the degree of market turbulence perceived by South Korean apparel store managers negatively affects the managers' satisfaction with their stores' performance (H2), and the degree of perceived competitive intensity positively affects the managers' satisfaction with store performance (H3). Eun Jin Hwang, Marjorie J. T. Norton Some researchers have reported that MO level is positively related to company performance (Shoham, Rose, and Kropp, 2005;Subramanian, Kumar, and Strandholm, 2009). Sound understanding of customers and competitors often results in effective decision making within a firm and leads to sales growth (Pelham and Wilson, 1996). Improved customer retention and sales follow when a market-oriented firm tracks customer satisfaction and implements timely responses to the generated information. Narver and Slater (1990) elaborated this view, stating that a business with strong MO will expend great effort to offer superior value to customers, thereby increasing the probability of offering superior value and enjoying profitability advantages over competitors. Slater and Narver (1994a) reported a positive relationship between MO and both sales growth and return on assets when controlling for market environment. Pitt, Caruana, and Berthon. (1996) and Caruana, Gauci, and Ferry (1995) found similar links. Researchers have found that MO can create a sustainable competitive advantage that leads to profit growth (Slater and Narver, 1994b) and increased success of new products (Perin and Sampaio, 2001). Silva, Moutinho, Coelho, and Marques (2009) concluded that a driving-market approach based on solid intelligence dissemination and a learning orientation helps improve performance; however, Chao and Spillan (2010) found for U.S. and Taiwanese small-and medium-sized enterprises that the intelligence generation and dissemination components of MO are unrelated to firm performance, but the responsiveness component of MO positively affects firm performance. On the basis of the literature, we hypothesized (H4) that each of four components of market orientation (i.e., intelligence generation and dissemination and response design and implementation) has a positive effect on South Korean apparel store managers' satisfaction with their stores' performance.\nThe questionnaire and cover letter were written in English, translated into Korean, and back translated into English to check retention of meaning. We sent the questionnaire and cover letter by facsimile to stores with facsimile numbers and by mail with postage-paid return envelops to those without such numbers. Respondents could return questionnaires by facsimile or mail. Dillman's (1978) total design method was used to increase the response rate. Two weeks after the initial mailing, a reminder postcard was sent to each store, followed by re-mailing the entire package to store managers who did not respond within three weeks of the initial mailing. The questionnaire contained scales to measure stores' MO, the managers' degree of satisfaction with their stores' performance, and the managers' perceptions of the degree of market turbulence and competitive intensity in South Korean retailing. Demographic information on respondents and their stores was also requested. Finally, a question was asked to confirm that each store carried apparel merchandise.\n\nOther results of the present study lead to the conclusion that perceived turbulence and competitive intensity in the Korean retail market reduce apparel store managers' satisfaction with their stores' performance, but proactively generating market intelligence and implementing responses to the intelligence increases satisfaction with store performance. Especially when implementing responses to market intelligence, managers experience satisfaction with their stores' performance, even in the face of market turbulence. Several researchers have indicated that firms' performance improves when they employ MO strategies (e.g., see Shoham et al., 2005;Subramaniam, 2009). Improved performance when using MO strategies seems to occur because firms that employ these strategies are constantly aware of the level of consumer satisfaction and expend great effort to offer high value to their customers, thereby increasing the probability of providing superior value and enjoying profitability advantages over competitors (Narver and Slater, 1990). This scenario is consistent with our findings. Indeed, our results suggest that, on their own, perceived market turbulence and competitive intensity have depressing effects on satisfaction with performance, but taking action in the form of MO strategies helps increase satisfaction with performance.. It thus appears that Korean apparel retailers that employ MO strategies should continue and even expand their use of these strategies, and those that do not employ MO strategies would benefit from findings ways to use these strategies, perhaps with the aid of their trade associations. As noted above, this study is the first to investigate the effects of environmental uncertainty on Korean apparel retailers' performance and MO strategies and the effect of these retailers' MO strategies on their Her research and teaching mainly concern consumer behaviour with respect to textiles and apparel, and the textile and apparel industry and trade."}, {"section_title": "Sampling and data collection", "text": "Primary data collection was conducted with a self-administered questionnaire sent to top managers of apparel retail stores in five major cities or towns in South Korea: Seoul, Deajeon, Suwon, Daegu, and Busan.

At least 200 respondents were needed for the structural equation model estimated in data analysis.

The marketturbulence items, adapted from Jaworski and Kohli (1993), concerned the perceived degree of change over time in a store's customers and their preferences or purchase criteria. The competitive-intensity items were designed to measure the perceived degree of competition in South Korean apparel retailing on the basis of a method Khandwalla (1972Khandwalla ( , 1977 used to measure competitive intensity perceived by management. Lawrence and Lorsch (1967) argued that the perceived level of competition, rather than the actual level of competition, influences managers' decisions in response to their firms' operating environment. Some other questionnaire items adapted from Jaworski and Kohli (1993) were used to measure four components of MO strategy: intelligence generation (3 items), intelligence dissemination (5 items), and response design and implementation (3 items each), with response from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (5). A subjective, rather than objective, measure of store performance was used for the following reasons. Because private firms' financial information is usually confidential, respondents may be unwilling to provide such data. Objective and subjective measures of firm performance are strongly related (Dawes, 1999;Jaworksi and Kohli;1993). Many researchers have used subjective performance measures (e.g., see Bowman and Ambrosini, 1997;Wooldridge and Floyd, 1990). We measured retail store performance with a modified version of a scale developed by Gupta and Govindarajan (1984). Respondents were asked to rate on a scale from highly dissatisfied (1) to highly satisfied (5) their degree of satisfaction with their own stores' current performance relative to other stores in their industry and separately relative to their stores' key competitors on each of the following financial performance criteria: return on investment, earnings growth, sales growth, market share, return on assets, and cash flow. Responses for the six performance criteria were averaged for satisfaction with performance relative to key competitors and separately for satisfaction with performance relative to other stores in the retail industry. The preliminary questionnaire was pilot tested with 10 South Korean retail store managers and 5 faculty members at a major South Korean university. The managers were asked to complete the questionnaire; they and the faculty members were asked to assess the content, wording, comprehension, completion time, and appropriateness of questions.

The results indicate lack of support for hypothesis 1 as stated, but those for two of the eight cases tested for this hypothesis show the hypothesized significant positive direct effects of market turbulence on the response design and implementation components of MO strategy. Those two significant cases indicate that the more (less) the market turbulence perceived by apparel store managers, the more (less) the managers design and implement responses to market Eun Jin Hwang, Marjorie J. T. Norton intelligence. These findings are consistent with those of Jaworski and Kohli (1993) and the argument by Davis et al. (1991) that environmental change motivates firms to adopt MO strategies. Our results also show, contrary to hypothesis 1, that competitive intensity has a significant negative effect on the response design component of MO strategy; thus, the more (less) the perceived competitive intensity, the less (more) apparel store managers design responses to market intelligence. Our finding of no significant effects in five of the cases tested for hypothesis 1 aligns with the results of Pelham and Wilson (1996) that market dynamism and competitive intensity do not influence the degree of MO among small firms. SEM results do not support hypotheses 2 and 3 as stated, but they support one hypothesized effect: Market turbulence has a significant negative direct effect on satisfaction with store performance relative to other stores in the retail industry; thus, the more (less) the market turbulence perceived by apparel store managers, the less (more) the managers' satisfaction with their stores' performance relative to other stores in the Korean retail industry. This result agrees with similar findings of Power and Reid (2003) and Nickell et al. (1997). Our results also show, contrary to hypothesis 3, that competitive intensity has a significant negative direct effect on satisfaction with store performance relative to key competitors, indicating that the more (less) the competitive intensity perceived by apparel store managers, the less (more) the managers' satisfaction with their stores' performance relative to the stores' key competitors. Hypothesis 4 is not supported as stated, but four of the eight cases tested for this hypothesis produced significant results as hypothesized. The four significant cases are the positive effects of both intelligence generation and response implementation on satisfaction with store performance relative to key competitors and to other stores in the retail industry; thus, the more (less) that apparel store managers gather market intelligence and implement responses to the intelligence, the more (less) the managers' satisfaction with their stores' performance relative to key competitors and to other stores in the Korean retail industry. These findings, as well as the lack of significance for intelligence generation and dissemination, agree with those of Chao and Spillan (2010) regarding U.S. and Taiwanese small-and medium-sized enterprises. Our results for response implementation also indicate that market turbulence has counteracting direct and indirect effects on satisfaction with performance. As noted above, market turbulence has a negative direct effect on satisfaction with performance. The indirect effect of market turbulence on satisfaction with performance is positive and operates through response implementation because market turbulence has a significant positive effect on response implementation, which has a significant positive effect on satisfaction with performance. Thus, the more (less) the perceived market turbulence, the more (less) that South Korean Apparel Retail apparel store managers implement responses to market intelligence and in turn the more (less) the managers are satisfied with their stores' performance relative to both key competitors and to other stores in the Korean retail industry.

Market orientation is a key strategy devised in modern business, at least in Western business, to afford firms a means to understand and respond effectively to market conditions. Given that South Korean apparel retailers appear to have adopted MO strategies to some extent, but not at a high level, it may be unsurprising to find these retailers' limited use of MO strategies in response to market signals, specifically perceived market turbulence and competitive intensity. Our findings lead to the conclusion that these retailers do increase their efforts to design and implement responses to market intelligence the more the managers perceive turbulence in the market, but that the retailers have a reduced tendency to design responses to market intelligence the more the mangers perceive competitive intensity in the market; however, perceived market turbulence and competitive intensity do not appear to lead to collecting and disseminating market intelligence that could inform the retailers' activities. Perhaps these results are affected by some weakness in the reliability and validity of our measures of environmental uncertainty, but they agree with those of some other researchers, as noted previously, albeit not in the context of Korean apparel retailing. The small size of the retailers in our sample, and corresponding resource limitations, may impede efforts to gather market intelligence and formulate and implement responses to the intelligence. If so, it may help these retailers to join forces in contributing to R&D by a retail trade association as a way to at least generate market intelligence."}, {"section_title": "Empirical model and data sources 2.1. The model", "text": "We assume that the production function for an industry (i) has the following form: A is the augmentation factor of the input function, often referred to as MFP. 1is an aggregate of many components. Intermediate inputs consist of energy, non-energy materials and purchased services. Capital includes machinery and equipment, structures, land and inventories. Capital and labour inputs are aggregated using a \"constant quality\" method. 5 Many empirical studies that examine productivity growth are based on the growth accounting framework, with the assumptions of constant returns to scale and competitive product and factor markets. 6 Under this framework, the translog index of MFP growth for industry i is:"}, {"section_title": "Each of the inputs in equation", "text": "is the two-period average income share of input X in the value of gross output, and where the sum of income shares for all inputs equals one. Under this framework, MFP growth is calculated residually. It equals to the growth in gross output minus the contributions from changes in labour, capital, and intermediate inputs. As many have pointed out, besides technology progress, the residually calculated MFP growth also captures effects of a variety of other factors. Specifically, the residually calculated MFP growth could include the effect of both measured and unmeasured inputs that are not captured by the growth accounting framework. In selecting the potential factors that explain the residual, we assume that both fundamental and applied innovations are the main underlying factors of MFP growth in the longer term. R&D and human capital are assumed to be the main drivers of fundamental innovation, and M&E capital and human capital are likely to be the factors influencing applied innovation and adoption of new technologies. 7 For measured inputs whose productivity impacts may not be fully captured by the growth accounting framework, we include M&E capital and human capital. M&E capital is divided into ICT capital (computer equipment, communications equipment and software) and non-ICT M&E capital. Unlike other M&E assets, ICTs are commonly considered to be general-purpose technologies (GPTs). They may transform business organization and enable innovation, and generate additional productivity benefits through network effects, imitable business practices and human resource management, and increased competition. These effects are not captured using the growth accounting framework, and end up in the residual. The residual may also include the contribution of unaccounted inputs. 8 In this paper, we consider R&D and intangible assets. The latter often refers to new managerial practices, new skills, and new workplace organization. Unfortunately, for the most part these intangible assets are not counted as inputs for production for official statistical purposes, and are ignored in a typical productivity analysis. 9 As a result, the contribution of intangible assets to output growth is unmeasured and left in the residual. This paper estimates empirically the effect of the above mentioned measured and unmeasured factors on MFP growth, with a focus on ICT capital and intangible assets. Our econometric model is specified as follows: 10 (3) \u03d6 is the unobserved productivity shock which affects production decisions. Please note that ICT capital intensity, non-ICT M&E capital intensity and human capital variables are lagged one year to accommodate their delayed impact on MFP. In addition, industry dummies ( i D ) are included to capture industry-specific fixed effects. The industry-specific effects could happen due to differences in technology and/or market opportunities across industries. Furthermore, year dummies ( t D ) are used to capture time-sensitive factors common to all industries. The regression model departs from the growth accounting framework in two important aspects. First, it considers the endogeneity problem associated with the explanatory variables. Secondly, it deals with productivity effects of ICT capital and intangible assets, controlling for the impact of non-ICT M&E capital, R&D and human capital. It has been argued that reaping the full benefits of ICT technologies requires corresponding changes in organization and business practices. Brynjolfsson and Hitt (1995), Nguyen (2006a, 2006b), and Dufour, Nakamura and Tang (2007) provide empirical evidence suggesting that ICT-users that also invest in organizational capital have higher gains in productivity compared to firms that invest only in ICT capital. The co-investments have important implications for the econometric analysis in this paper. If the co-investments or intangible assets are inappropriately controlled for, the estimation may give too much credit to ICT capital. Thus, to obtain unbiased estimation results, the regression model needs somehow to control for the impact of intangible assets on productivity gains. The measurement of intangible assets will be discussed later on. The endogeneity or simultaneity issue, potentially associated with some explanatory variables, arises from contemporaneous correlation between those explanatory variables and error terms. In this paper, we refer to the problem as the potential correlation between explanatory variables and the unobserved industryspecific productivity shocks; that is, an industry may respond to a positive productivity shock by using more inputs such as investments in ICTs or hiring of more workers with a university education. Levinsohn and Petrin (2003) show that if the problem is not corrected, ordinary least squares (OLS) estimation will lead to biased parameter estimates and thus the impact of ICT capital on productivity. To overcome the endogeneity issue, we used the methodology that was developed by Olley and Pakes (1996) and followed up on by Levinsohn and Petrin (2003). 12 We specify unobserved multifactor productivity (MFP growth) for industry i at time t as  \u03b5 is that the former is a state variable, which impacts the industry's production decision, while the latter has no impact on the industry's decisions.

In other words, labour inputs are quantity indexes of hours worked using labour compensation as weights. The differences in growth rates between labour inputs and hours are the growth rate of labour quality. The quality adjustment is consistent with the production theory, which calls for marginal product of an input being equal to its price. Like labour input, capital input in the KLEMS databases is also quality-adjusted. However, Canada and the U.S. use significantly different depreciation rates in constructing capital stock. Consequently, capital input is not comparable between Canada and the U.S. The impact is especially large in terms of level for structures capital and small in terms of growth for all capital. 17 For a detailed discussion, see Ho, Rao and Tang (2004).

Table 1 reports the regressions results, taking into account the issue of endogeneity for the explanatory variables. All regressions are based on a fourth order polynomial expansion to approximate the non-parametric component. 19 The regression results are encouraging. The coefficients on purchased commercial services (our proxy for investment in intangibles), the human capital and the R&D intensity variables are positive and statistically significant. The coefficient on ICT capital is positive, but is not statistically significant. The coefficient on non-ICT M&E capital is also statistically insignificant. The results for ICT and non-ICT M&E capital hold even when one of them is excluded from the regression model. 20 Taking into account the endogeneity issue, we estimated the same regression equations for the U.S., using the data on all 33 industries as well as 23 goods industries. The results for goods industries are very similar to those for all industries. The estimation results for all industries are reported in table 2. They are quite different from those for Canada. First, unlike Canada, the estimated coefficients on the commercial services intensity, the human capital variable and the R&D intensity are not statistically significant. On the other hand, the coefficient on non-ICT M&E capital is statistically significant in four of the five equations. The coefficient on ICT capital is consistently positive, but is statistically significant only when non-ICT M&E capital is excluded from the regression equation, suggesting multi-collinearity between the two variables. The regression results in this paper are broadly consistent with the findings of our recent paper on the Canada-U.S. MFP gap (Rao, Tang and Wang, 2006). That paper finds that M&E capital played a key role in explaining the inter-industry differences in the MFP gap over time, while ICT capital by itself did not have a significant impact on the Canada-U.S. MFP gap. Thus, the results from the current paper generally support our earlier findings. Our results that ICT capital does not seem to have played a special role in explaining inter-industry differences in MFP growth in Canada and the U.S. are broadly consistent with the findings of other researchers regarding the absence of productivity spillovers from ICTs (see Stiroh (2002b), Triplett and Bosworth (2004), and Harchaoui and Tarkhani (2005)). 21"}, {"section_title": "Country sources of FDI and productivity: review of empirical evidence", "text": "Although there are a large number of studies examining the host-country productivity impacts of inward FDI, most of them do not consider the issue that the potential productivity benefits may greatly vary across the FDI's country of origin. In fact, it has been argued that the contributions of FDI from different countries may differ significantly because of substantial differences in the sophistication of Eric C.Y. Ng and Malick Souare technology/knowledge, managerial practices, motives and strategic approaches across countries of origin. In this section, we briefly review some existing studies that disaggregate the productivity effects of inward FDI across different country sources, and compare them. Using data on 26 emerging market countries over the period 1989 through 1997, Kim, Lyn, and Zychowicz (2003) investigate whether economic growth in developing countries depends on the technology transfer they receive from FDI inflows. More specifically, they test whether technology transfer, ceteris paribus, depends on the attributes of FDI providers, particularly as they relate to the degree of technological advancement and the behavioural aspects of the technology transfer. The test is accomplished by looking at the impact on economic growth of FDI from two important and advanced FDI providers, Japan and the US, where multinational corporations (MNCs) domiciled in the two nations exhibit distinct variation in these attributes. They find some evidence that the relationship between the economic growth of the host countries and FDI inflows is stronger for the US-originated FDI than that of Japanese-originated FDI. They also find that the technology transfers from the US MNCs have an even greater impact for more economically disadvantaged countries. They contend that these findings are consistent with the notion that the US MNCs are more effective in generating technology transfers and spillovers to developing countries than do Japanese MNCs during the period under study. In another developing country study, Banga (2004) posits that the spillover effects of FDI from different sources may differ as they come with different levels of technology and different modes of transferring the technology into different industries. He examines empirically the spillover effects of Japanese and the US FDI on the total factor productivity (TFP) growth of the Indian firms, both at the firm and industry level. The results suggest that the presence of Japanese equity in the industry has a positive spillover effect while the market share of Japanese firms is negatively associated with the productivity growth of the Indian firms. However, the net spillover effect at the industry level is positive. The spillover effects from the US FDI are, however, not significant. After showing that foreign-controlled establishments are more productive than domestically owned establishments in Canada, Globerman, Ries and Vertinsky (1994) examine whether the observed labor productivity level gaps are sensitive to the foreign affiliate's home country. Their regression analysis finds no significant differences in the performance of Canadian establishments owned by the US, European, and Japanese firms. In other words, their findings suggest that FDI provides potential Inward FDI and Productivity Performance in Canadian Industries economic benefits to the Canadian economy, but reject the hypothesis that these benefits are sensitive to the country sources of FDI. Thus, as policy recommendations, they conclude that targeting promotion activities to attract direct investment from specific countries should be attempted only if the sensitivities of investment to promotional efforts differ across countries, while the costs of promotion are relatively constant across countries. Griffith and Simpson (2003) investigate the extent to which the lagging labor productivity level of U.K.owned manufacturing establishments arises when compared to establishments of different foreign ownerships operating within Britain. First, considering establishments that do not change ownership nationality during the period under study, they find that North American-owned establishments have around 68% higher labor productivity than UK-owned ones, EU-owned around 53% higher, other European-owned 42% higher, Japanese-owned around 64% and other foreign around 77% higher. Second, with establishments that experience a change in ownership nationality (due to a takeover or merger), they find that domestic establishments that are taken over by foreign-owned firms, particularly North American-owned ones, improve their productivity faster than establishments going from being foreign to domestically owned. Two other U.K. studies by  and Harris and Robinson (2003) also use micro-based manufacturing data to test the differences in TFP between U.K. domestic and different foreign ownerships. They both find that the US-owned plants typically perform better than the U.K.owned plants, and that overall there is little or no evidence of a clear productivity advantage of other foreign owned plants over domestic plants -other nationalities of ownership include EU, SE Asia, Old Commonwealth and/or the rest of the world. 3 In a Swedish study using a panel of manufacturing firm data, Karpaty and Lundberg (2004) evaluate whether the effects of the presence of foreign-owned firms on the TFP of domestic firms depend on the nationality of the foreign MNEs. Their results suggest that the US firms have a stronger positive effect on the productivity of Swedish-owned firms than FDI from the rest of the world. They argue that this may be due to a larger stock of firm specific knowledge that could be dispersed to local firms, or to an inability to prevent spillovers. Eric C.Y. Ng and Malick Souare Using the US manufacturing plant-level data, Doms and Jensen (1998) examine the labor and total factor productivity differentials across the nationality of ownership. Although they report that foreign-owned establishments have higher productivity than the average US-owned establishment, there appear to be no large differences among foreign-owned establishments based on country of ownership. However, the establishments owned by the US multinationals are the most productive ones, followed by the establishments of foreign multinationals. Thus, they contend that what may be important in explaining productivity differences is ownership by a multinational rather than foreign ownership per se. Finally, Benfratello and Sembenelli (2006) estimate the effect of foreign ownership on TFP of firms located in Italy. After controlling for the simultaneity (or endogeneity) of the ownership variable, they find that nationality matters since the firms under the US ownership tend to be significantly more productive than the firms under other nationalities of ownership (including both domestic-and other foreign-owned firms, where the latter are found to be less productive than the former). It emerges from this literature review that the host-country productivity impacts of inward FDI depend on the investment country (home country) or the nationality of the foreign affiliates, with sufficiently comprehensive evidence that the US-owned firms or US MNEs tend to outperform both domestically owned firms and non-US MNEs. In the next section, we set up an empirical framework to investigate whether there are differences in productivity growth impacts of inward FDI in Canada by country of origin."}, {"section_title": "Empirical models and data measurements", "text": "In this section, we use industry-level panel data to examine whether inward FDI matters for the industry's productivity performance in Canada. Considering first the impact of the total inward FDI (i.e. regardless of the country of origin), we estimate the following equation: (1) where i and t denote industry and time, respectively; TFPG i is the annual growth of TFP (growth in valueadded minus the value-added share weighted growth in labour and capital); FDI i , RDI i and MEI i are the total inward FDI intensity (FDI divided by GDP), R&D intensity (business enterprise R&D intramural expenditure divided by GDP), and M&E capital intensity (real net stock of machinery and equipment divided by GDP), respectively; CAP i is the capacity utilization rate (ratio of cyclical GDP to trend GDP); Inward FDI and Productivity Performance in Canadian Industries \u03b4 i is the industry-specific fixed effect, \u03b3 t is the time-specific effect; and \u03b5 it is the error term. The Hodrick-Prescott filter is used to decompose the GDP into the trend and cyclical components. The effect of total inward FDI is captured by the coefficient \u03b1 1 . A positive sign of this coefficient suggests that total inward FDI contributed positively to the TFP growth. It has been identified in the literature that TFP growth can be driven by technical change, which in turn is induced by fundamental and applied innovation. As discussed in Rao et al. (2008), fundamental innovation is affected by R&D activities while applied innovation or adoption and diffusion of new and state-of-art technologies is influenced by M&E capital. To control for the effect of technical changes induced by both factors, we include the R&D intensity and M&E capital intensity as additional explanatory variables. The coefficients of RDI and MEI are expected to have a positive sign. Business cycles can affect factor utilization in the short term (because of delays in factor adjustments to shocks), which in turn will affect TFP. We include the change in capacity utilization (CAP), to account for the effect of business cycles (or factor hoarding) on productivity. As the main objective of the paper is to examine whether FDI from different countries or regions has a differential impact on the productivity performance in Canada, we also estimate the following equation: where is the intensity of inward FDI from country/region j. j i FDI If FDI from country or region j contributes positively to the industry's TFP growth, the coefficient of (\u03b2 j i FDI j ) should have a positive sign. It should be noted that the industry's TFP growth in Equation 2includes the productivity performance of both domestic and foreign firms within the same industry in Canada. Hence, the estimation of Equation (2) can only reveal whether FDI from different countries has an impact on the industry's TFP growth on average. Moreover, as a result of the within-industry analysis, a potential positive effect of FDI could be the result of higher productivity in the foreign owned firms and/or their productivity (or technological spillovers) to domestically owned ones. Thus, it cannot identify whether FDI from different countries involves any spillovers to domestic (Canadian-owned) firms."}, {"section_title": "Eric C.Y. Ng and Malick Souare", "text": "To estimate the spillover effect of FDI, it is necessary to measure separately the TFP growth for domesticand foreign-owned firms by industrial sector in Canada. Unfortunately, the unavailability of TFP data by firm's country ownership precludes us to conduct the analysis directly. On the other hand, the availability of output data for domestic firms (by industrial sector) enables us to investigate whether FDI from different countries has any spillover impact on the output growth of domestic firms. To do so, we estimate the following equation: where OUTG_DOM i is the real gross output growth of domestic firms by industrial sector; RDI_DOM i is the R&D intensity of domestic firms by industry (R&D expenditure of Canadian owned firms divided by their respective gross output). The data used in this paper are obtained from various CANSIM tables of Statistics Canada, and the OECD Globalization database. Regarding the industry-level inward FDI data from different countries or regions, CANSIM Table 376-0052 enables us to construct balanced panel data for the period 1999 through 2007 with 3-region FDI sources and 22 industries (by NAICS classification). In particular, the 3-region data covers FDI from the US, European and other regions (including Asian, other American and other countries). After taking into account the availability of data for all variables, we estimate Equations (1) and (2) using panel data of the 3-region FDI sources over 1999-2005. On the other hand, Equation (3) is estimated using the 3-region FDI sources data for the sample period from 2000 to 2005."}, {"section_title": "Empirical estimation results", "text": "Before examining the impact of inward FDI on productivity performance, it is interesting to look at the average productivity performance for all industries under study and their distribution of FDI share by country/region of origin. Table 3 reports the industry's average TFP growth over the period of 1999-2005 and the average country's/region's share of inward FDI in the corresponding industry for the same period. The wood product, primary metal, paper and transportation equipment manufacturing industries exhibited high productivity growth on average during 1999-2005 with TFP growth of over 3%. By contrast, the resource industries (mining, oil and gas extraction), electrical equipment and appliance, computer and Inward FDI and Productivity Performance in Canadian Industries electronic product manufacturing industries underperformed the average by recording negative TFP growth rates during the same period. Regarding the inward FDI distribution by country/region of origin, the US had the highest FDI share in almost all industries with the average share (across industries and sample period) of over 70%. The second highest FDI share came from European countries with the average share of about 23%. Other countries, including Asian, other American and other countries, had limited foreign investment in Canada with the average share of only about 6%. Finally, it is noteworthy that the industrial distribution of inward FDI in Canada does not give support to the view that FDI might be attracted to industries where firms on average happen to be more productive. To assess the impact of inward FDI on productivity performance, we estimate Equations (1), (2) and 3separately for the corresponding sample period as described in Section 4. We use the generalized least squares (GLS) estimator to correct for the heteroskedasticity across industries. Further, to reduce potential reverse causality issues, the lagged variables of FDI, R&D and M&E capital intensities are used in the regression analysis. The estimation results for Equations (1) and(2) are summarized in Column A and B of Table 4, respectively. The total inward FDI has a positive and significant effect on TFP growth. The coefficient suggests that a 1 percent-point increase in FDI intensity leads to a 0.1% increase in TFP growth. This empirical finding is consistent with the theoretical discussion in Section 1 that inward FDI can enhance productivity in the host-country industries where it operates through two channels. The first channel is the direct effect of superior productivity efficiency in foreign affiliates. The second channel is the productivity or technological knowledge spillovers from inward FDI to domestic firms within the same industry. 4 Besides, as expected, we also find that R&D intensity (a proxy for fundamental innovation) and capacity utilization (a proxy for business cycle effect) have a positive and significant impact on TFP growth. On the other hand, M&E capital intensity (a proxy for applied innovation) has a positive but insignificant effect on productivity growth. 5 Eric C.Y. Ng and Malick Souare Turning to the question on whether country sources of inward FDI matter for productivity performance, the estimation result suggests that FDI from different regions does have a differential impact on TFP growth. The FDI from the US has a positive and significant effect on productivity performance. A 1 percent-point increase in the intensity of FDI from the US results in a 0.13% increase in TFP growth. On the other hand, the FDI from European and other regions (including Asian, other American and other countries) tends to have no significant impact on productivity growth. As mentioned earlier, this finding of a positive impact of the US FDI could be the result of higher productivity in the US-owned firms and/or productivity or technological knowledge spillovers from the US to Canada via FDI. A recent study by Acharya and Keller (2009) lends support to these findings by reporting that the US domestic R&D spillovers to Canada are much larger than the spillovers from major European countries (such as Germany, France, and the UK). A potential explanation is that the US conducts most of the R&D in the world, and that the Canada-US economic relationship is the closest and most extensive among the industrialized countries. 6 In addition, using data on management practices from the US, France, Germany, and the UK, Bloom and Van Reenen (2007) find that the US firms, on average, are better managed than the European firms, and that managerial practices are strongly and positively associated with firm-level productivity. Recall that the observed positive productivity impact from the US FDI accords with and can be attributed to both superior productivity in the US foreign affiliates and their productivity spillovers to domestically owned firms. However, to investigate whether inward FDI exerts any positive spillover effect on the performance of Canadian-owed firms, we examine its impact on the output growth of domestic firms by industrial sector. To do so, we estimate Equation (3) using the 3-region FDI source classification and other control variables as mentioned above. The estimation result is presented in Table 5. Similar to the above findings about the effect of the US FDI on TFP growth, we also find that FDI from the US has a positive and significant impact on the output growth of domestic firms. Specifically, 1 percent-point increase in the US FDI intensity increases the output growth of domestic firms by 0.12%. This suggests that FDI from the US exerts positive spillovers on domestic output performance. By contrast, FDI from European region has no significant effect on domestic output growth, which is comparable to the above result that FDI from European region has no significant impact on the aggregate industry TFP growth. Interestingly, we also find that FDI from other regions (including Asian, other American and other countries) has a negative and significant effect on domestic output performance.

The appreciation of the Canadian dollar against most foreign currencies subtracted about $72 billion from the overall position of Canada's direct investment abroad, while foreign direct investment in Canada was up 1.6 percent. This was well below the average annual growth of 9 percent of foreign direct investment in Canada over the last decade, and reflected considerably slower investment activity in the year, especially from the United States. The net direct investment asset position narrowed to $43.9 billion, from $100.8 billion in 2008. The United States and the United Kingdom remained the two top destinations for Canadian direct investment abroad, though investment continues to diversify geographically. Canadian direct investment assets abroad at the end of 2009 were spread over countries on most continents, with 35 countries having at least $1 billion in Canadian investment. 2.

The value of Canadian direct investment assets abroad decreased in all other major European countries at the end of 2009, largely due to the strengthening of the Canadian dollar relative to many currencies. Nevertheless, Canada's most significant European destinations of direct investment remained Ireland, with investments totalling $22.7 billion; France with $15.9 billion; Hungary with $12.2 billion; the Netherlands and Germany with $9.8 billion and $9.6 billion, respectively; and Switzerland with $6.7 billion.
