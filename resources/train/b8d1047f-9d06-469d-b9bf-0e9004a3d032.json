[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Background: Both amyloid (A\u2424) load and APOE4 allele are associated with neurodegenerative changes in Alzheimer's disease (AD) prone regions and with risk for cognitive impairment. Objective: To evaluate the unique and independent contribution of APOE4 allele status (E4+\\E4-), A\u2424 status (Amy+\\Amy-), and combined APOE4 and A\u2424 status on regional cortical thickness (CoTh) and cognition among participants diagnosed as cognitively normal (CN, n = 251), early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI, n = 207), late mild cognitive impairment (LMCI, n = 196), and mild AD (n = 162) from the ADNI. Methods: A series of two-way ANCOVAs with post-hoc Tukey HSD tests, controlling independently for A\u2424 and APOE4 status and age were examined. Results: Among LMCI and AD participants, cortical thinning was widespread in association with Amy+ status, whereas in association with E4+ status only in the inferior temporal and medial orbito-frontal regions. Among CN and EMCI participants, E4+ status, but not Amy+ status, was independently associated with increased CoTh, especially in limbic regions [e.g., in the entorhinal cortex, CoTh was 0.123 mm greater (p = 0.002) among E4+ than E4-participants]. Among CN and EMCI, both E4+ and Amy+ status were independently associated with cognitive impairment, which was greatest among those with combined E4 + and Amy+ status. \nConclusion: Decreased CoTh is independently associated with Amy+ status in many brain regions, but with E4+ status in very restricted number of brain regions. Among CN and EMCI participants, E4 + status is associated with increased CoTh, in medial and inferior temporal regions, although cognitive impairment at this state is independently associated with Amy+ and E4 + status. These findings imply a unique pathophysiological mechanism for E4 + status in AD and its progression."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "According to the amyloid hypothesis [1] , deposition of amyloid-\u2424 protein (A\u2424) in the neocortex, is the initiating event in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and occurs 15 to 20 years before the first symptoms of the disease. This leads to downstream events including neurodegeneration and ultimately cognitive and functional impairment. Recent neuropathological diagnostic criteria for AD are based upon this hypothesis, incorporating the Thal phase schema of a stereotypic pattern of A\u2424 accumulation, anteceding Braak staging of neurofibrillary tangle pathology in the brain, with a continuous relationship existing between brain A\u2424 load and neurodegenerative changes [2] . There is also considerable evidence that APOE E4 (APOE4) carrier (E4+) status is associated with greater A\u2424 load in normal individuals as well as in all stages of AD, possibly as a result of the effect of APOE4 genotype on impaired clearance of A\u2424 protein [3, 4] . Aging and E4+ status are among the most strongly associated factors with increased risk for AD [3] [4] [5] .\nDeposition of A\u2424 in vivo is detectable with positron emission tomography (PET) scans, using an A\u2424 binding ligand, or by measuring A\u2424 levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), whereas downstream events such as neurodegeneration are detectable using volumetric measures of regional atrophy (especially hippocampal atrophy) and reduced cortical thickness (CoTh) on structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, as well as deficits in regional cerebral glucose metabolism on PET scans. Recent clinical criteria for the diagnosis of AD dementia and Prodromal AD (NIA-AA and IWG criteria) rely on combinations of \"positive biomarkers\" in the presence of functional and/or cognitive impairment with high, intermediate or low levels of likelihood [6, 7] based on the presence of A\u2424 and neurodegenerative biomarkers. The presence of A\u2424 biomarkers in the absence of cognitive and functional impairment fulfills criteria for a diagnosis of preclinical AD.\nAlthough it is well accepted that A\u2424 load, APOE4 status, and neurodegeneration are strongly interrelated [8] , the presence and strength of the relationships between these factors and their independent effects on cortical thinning and cognition are not well understood at different stages of disease. As emerging treatments are developed, it is increasingly important to understand these independent relationships prior to developing appropriate disease modifying treatments for AD.\nThe relationship between E4+ status and higher A\u2424 load is well known, as is the relationship of both E4 + status and higher A\u2424 load to a greater risk for developing Alzheimer's disease and a greater degree of neurodegeneration [4, [9] [10] [11] . However, the relationship of APOE4 status to neurodegeneration and cognitive decline, independent of A\u2424 load, and the relationship of A\u2424 load to neurodegeneration and cognitive decline, independent of APOE4 status, are not known and to our knowledge have not been studied thus far.\nIn the present study, we examined both the combined and independent associations between global A\u2424 load, APOE4 status, and regional CoTh among four different diagnostic groups in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) sample, including cognitively normal (CN), early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI), late mild cognitive impairment (LMCI), or AD dementia participants. A unique aspect of this investigation was to determine the independent and combined effects of APOE4 status and A\u2424 load on regional CoTh and cognition among individuals presenting with minimal (EMCI) or no overt memory impairment (CN)."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study data", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the ADNI database (http://adni.loni. usc.edu).

Previous studies have shown that: (1) higher global A\u2424 load and E4+ status are associated with a greater risk of progression from CN to MCI, and MCI to AD [22, 23] ; (2) higher A\u2424 load is associated with reduced CoTh, but with subtle impairment of cognition in the CN and MCI stage [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] ; (3) E4+ status is associated with an earlier age of onset of A\u2424 positivity and of AD, greater A\u2424 levels in the brain, reduced hippocampal volumes and CoTh in limbic and neocortical regions, and subtle cognitive deficits in CN individuals [4, 5, [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] ; (4) further, irrespective of APOE4 status, reduced hippocampal volumes and CoTh in various brain regions, especially those regions characterized as AD signature regions, are associated with impaired memory and general cognition, as well as a greater risk for progression from CN to MCI and MCI to AD [44] . However, there is currently no consensus regarding the extent to which A\u2424 load status and APOE4 status, independently and in combination, are associated with neurodegenerative changes in AD prone regions and with cognitive impairment.\nIt is important to note that both trophic and toxic effects of A\u2424 peptide are known and they may not necessarily be mutually exclusive. The toxic effects may be mediated by different mechanisms, such as oxidative stress, inflammation, mitochondrial diffusion, alterations in membrane permeability, synaptic dysfunction, and excitotoxicity through its interaction with neurotransmitter receptors. These effects contribute significantly to the neuronal damage seen in AD, which may be associated with A\u2424 itself, including high concentrations in fibrillar or aggregated states, interaction with free metals, interactions with previously injured or aged brain tissue and with decreased antioxidative mechanisms [45] [46] [47] [48] .\nWe devised our analytic strategy to investigate, among 906 participants in the ADNI-1/ADNI-Go and ADNI-2 cohorts, the unique and independent contributions of those elements, which are considered as upstream factors (i.e., A\u2424 load status and APOE4 status), on downstream factors (regional CoTh and cognitive measures tapping memory and general cognition). We also investigated the individual and additive effects of E4+ and Amy+ status on CoTh and cognitive performance, in the earliest stages of neurodegeneration, using different combinations of APOE4 status and A\u2424 load status (E4-/Amy-, E4+ /Amy-, E4-/Amy+ and E4+ /Amy+) among CN and EMCI participants. Our results confirmed previous reports showing that E4+ status is associated with increased A\u2424 load among all stages of AD (Table 2) . Amy+ status, among all participants, was found to be associated with reduced CoTh in many AD vulnerable regions, independent of the effects of E4+ status (Table 3) [28, 29, 49, 50] , but E4+ status was associated with reduced CoTh in restricted brain regions, and only among LMCI and AD participants (Table 4) . Unexpectedly, E4+ status was associated with increased CoTh in some of the most vulnerable brain regions to AD pathology (i.e., the ERC, PHG, and ITG) in the preclinical and very early stages of AD (i.e., among CN and EMCI participants) ( Table 5) .\nEven though we found there was no observed cortical thinning in association with Amy+ status, and there was cortical thickening in association with E4+ status, among CN and EMCI participants, there was impairment on all cognitive tests among these participants, in association with either Amy+ and E4+ status, independently and to the greatest extent with combined Amy+ and E4+ status (Table 6 ). Global cognitive scores (ADAS13), among CN and EMCI participants, were significantly impaired among E4+ /Amy+groups as compared to all other groups, including those who were E4+ /Amy-, suggesting that the presence of Amy+ status is independently associated with greater impairment of global cognitive scores. Further, memory impairment, on the RAVLT immediate test, was greater among those who were E4-/Amy+, as compared to those who were E4+ /Amy+, suggesting that the presence of E4+ status is independently associated with greater immediate memory impairment. These results demonstrate that in the earliest stages of AD, in the absence of cortical thinning, there is impairment in cognitive performance attributable to combined E4+ and Amy+ status, as well as independently to E4+ status and to Amy+ status. Given that there is a known relationship between CoTh and cognitive scores [44, 51, 52] , the finding among CN and EMCI participants, who are E4+, of an association with increased CoTh in the most vulnerable regions to AD pathology, suggests that the mechanism underlying neurodegeneration associated with E4+ status is distinct from that of Amy+ status.\nBiological processes, such as metabolic activation, increased blood flow and inflammation [53, 54] , may result in increased volume of the cortical ribbon in brain regions, in which the neurodegenerative process begins, with subsequent cortical thinning as neurodegeneration becomes more advanced [55] [56] [57] . It is apparent that APOE4 is a contributing factor to neurodegeneration, and is strongly linked to AD pathology, alone and particularly in combination with the A\u2424 peptide. APOE4 may increase A\u2424 deposition in plaques and impair its clearance, and also may act independently through pathways that may not involve A\u2424 [52] . The pathophysiological effects of APOE4 may be mediated at a molecular level in the process of redistribution of lipids in normal lipid homeostasis, repairing injured neurons, maintaining synapto-dendritic connections, and scavenging toxins. These pathophysiological effects result in adverse outcomes in various neurological conditions and in \"normal\" aging. E4+ status is associated with adverse outcomes, acceleration of progression, worsening overall prognosis in response to head injury, oxidative stress, ischemia, and inflammation, as well as lowering of the age of onset of neurodegenerative disease [55] .\nA weakness of this study is that it is cross-sectional and so any inferences about progression from the CN to AD stage must be considered tentative. A major strength of the current investigation is that it utilizes a well-characterized ADNI cohort, including large numbers of subjects who are cognitively normal or in the earliest stages of disease, to power the analyses. These large numbers of subjects that are available in the ADNI cohort provide the statistical power required to tease apart independent effects of upstream biological processes, such as A\u2424 load and APOE4 status as they relate to downstream effects on CoTh and cognition. Future analyses should attempt to confirm these findings using longitudinal analyses of the data, and to further evaluate the effects of regional, rather than global deposition of A\u2424, on CoTh and cognition.\nIn conclusion, our findings suggest that both A\u2424 load and APOE4 status are highly associated with progressive neurodegeneration, as measured by cortical thinning, especially in the LMCI and AD stages, and especially in brain regions which are vulnerable to AD pathology. Even though there is no significant cortical thinning noted in CN and EMCI stages, associated with E4+ or Amy+ status, there is measurable cognitive impairment present. The association Fig. 4 .
