APOE-\u03b54 is by far the strongest single gene variant contributing to increased AD risk and plays key roles in lipid transport and metabolism. Presence of the APOE-\u03b54 variant is correlated with higher cholesterol levels in the blood [2] . More than twenty additional genes have recently been implicated in AD with functional roles in lipid-processing, immune regulation, and phagocytosis. Hence, both comorbidities and known gene variants support the idea that metabolic dysfunctions may contribute to AD onset and progression. Comprehensive biochemical profiling of biofluids can provide new insights into AD biology and expand the battery of hypotheses to find new therapeutic options for AD.\nLipidomics methods using liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry yield reliable measurements of hundreds of lipids in biological samples. Liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry methods have been used in AD studies in attempts to define possible risk factors [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] , diagnostic markers [8] , and for highlighting novel drug targets [9] [10] [11] . Perturbations in ceramides and related sphingomyelin (SM) metabolism [4, 7] were noted in many of these studies pointing toward a possible role of these lipids in aberrant signaling pathways, membrane remodeling, and apoptotic cascades during AD progression. Changes in phosphatidylcholines were observed in several studies [11] [12] [13] pointing to a possible role for phospholipid metabolism in AD pathogenesis. Yet, AD risk prediction failed to replicate using a phosphatidylcholine (PC) biomarker panel [11, 14] . Partial correlation network analysis indicated early AD biomarker Ab 1-42 was associated with PC and SM [11] . These studies support the hypothesis that distinct lipid biochemical pathways were dysregulated in early and late phase of AD.\nHere, we used LC-MS/MS-based serum lipidomics analysis measured in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative Phase 1 (ADNI1) cohort to define the lipid coregulatory network of AD phenotypes, a statistical analysis tool that previously has been successfully used in the analysis of transcriptomic data [15] .

Raw P-values from these association models will be used as an input for the lipid-set enrichment analysis in the following section. Fig. 1 shows the number of significantly associated lipids in these regression models. A total of 168 lipids were found to be significant in at least one regression model (raw P-value , .05), making it difficult to biologically interpret them on individual lipid level. Two AD phenotypes showed strong positive associations with individual serum lipids, CSF total tau and SPARE-AD. Conversely, three phenotypes were mostly negatively associated with individual blood lipids, including the two related phenotypes AD diagnosis and its major contributor, ADASCog13. Overall, AD diagnosis was associated with a decline in many lipid levels which could point to lower metabolic activity in specific lipid metabolic pathways. When analyzing all individual lipids that were associated with at least one AD phenotype, we found a very high specificity of lipid associations with a particular AD phenotype ( Fig. 2 and Supplementary  Table 3 ). Forty eight percentage of (168/349) of all lipids were associated with at least one AD phenotype ( Supplementary Table 3 ). Specifically, for known lipids, 63% of all AD phenotype-associated lipids were specific to only one phenotype and not shared with others ( Fig. 3 ). Twenty eight percentages of the detected associations of known lipids were shared between two phenotypes, driven by lipids shared between the two related phenotypes AD diagnosis and its major contributor, ADASCog13, in addition to lipids shared between total tau and SPARE-AD. Conversely, Abeta142 showed few shared lipids. Importantly, there was no identified lipid that was shared between four phenotypes, and only one lipid that was associated with all AD-phenotypes (arachidonyl-lysophosphatidylethanolamine; LPE C20:4). Many lipids are coregulated by the activity of specific lipases or other enzymes involved in lipid remodeling. Identifying commonalities of biochemical mechanisms may lead to underlying genetic drivers or environmental factors implicated in AD etiology. Therefore, we next focused on identifying sets of coregulated lipids associated with AD pathophysiology rather than interpreting individual lipids."}, {"section_title": "Identifying sets of coregulated lipids", "text": "Lipid classification often uses chemical structure as the only criterion. To specify the biochemical relationships between circulating blood lipids, we instead used correlation analysis to determine sets of lipids. A pairwise Spearman correlation matrix followed by hierarchical clustering with the DynamicTreeCut dendrogram cutting method [18] yielded a total of 28 coregulated lipid sets in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative Phase 1 data set ( Fig. 3 ). The mean size was 12.5 lipids per set, ranging from 4 to 28 members. These lipid sets (LM) were named LM1 to LM28. The average Spearman correlation coefficient rho across sets was 0.63 with a range of 0.19 , r , 0.82. Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 2 show that some lipid coregulatory sets were composed of lipids from the same chemical classes (such as set 17 for free fatty acids, set 1 for triacylglycerides, and set 14 for ceramides) whereas other sets were heterogeneous (such as set 3 consisting of ceramides and SMs, or set 7 that includes phosphatidylinositols and phosphatidylcholines). Interestingly, several classes of lipids were found with distinct coregulation within each class. For example, triacylglycerides were not found as one large group of coregulated species, but clustered in three specific sets, and similarly, free fatty acids were found in two different sets, set 9 consisting only of saturated fatty acids and set 17 comprised only of unsaturated fatty acids. Similarly, other lipid classes were distributed across different sets, too. For example, phosphatidylcholines were found in five sets and SMs were coregulated in three sets, indicating downstream regulation of lipid biochemistry by specific elongases, desaturases, lipases, and acyl-transferases within each lipid class ( Fig. 2 )."}, {"section_title": "Associating lipid sets with AD phenotypes", "text": "These lipid groups served as input for a lipid-set enrichment analysis [19] along with the P-value and beta coefficient results from the regression models.

Eight sets were uniquely associated with only one specific AD phenotype, but only one set was associated with four phenotypes, set 11, consisting primarily of ceramides and phosphatidylcholines. Set 11 did not include polyunsaturated acyl chains with three or more double bonds. Six sets were associated with two AD phenotypes and four sets were correlated with three AD phenotypes, but no set correlated with all five phenotypes.\nMore than two-thirds of all associations were positively correlated between lipid sets and phenotypes, mostly driven by the t-tau phenotype that also had the highest number of correlated lipid sets.

Set 26 consisted exclusively of triacylglycerides that also contained either EPA or DHA, but not a single saturated fatty acid. Set 4 was mixed between different phospholipid head groups, cholesteryl esters and free fatty acids, indicating that the coregulation mechanisms focused on the modulation and incorporation of acyl chains irrespective of the lipid class. Set 23 was also negatively correlated with AD diagnosis and comprised DHA-containing choline-and ethanolamineplasmalogens. Conversely, two other sets of lipids were positively associated with AD diagnosis, most significantly for set 5 and set 20, and less significantly with set 11 and set 12. Set-5 contained coregulated di-and triacylglycerols with acyl groups that did not contain any PUFA with four or more double bonds, and only one single lipid with lino-lenic acid (C18:3).

We systematically tested both the association of individual lipids and the association with sets of coregulated lipids. This approach showed an important advantages over previous \"feature\" based lipidomics AD studies [9, 20] that did not focus on specific lipid groups, their side chains, or their biological regulation. Without clear lipid identification, feature-based associations miss biological insights and have a high risk of not being validated in subsequent studies because each individual lipid may cause more than one feature in LC/MS based lipidomics [20, 21] . Instead we used the largest published AD lipidomics data set [17] to date with 349 identified lipids belonging to 13 major lipid classes, identified by extensive MS/MS fragmentation analysis [22] and enabling analyses reaching to the level of acyl chains. A second difference to previous efforts was a focus on summarizing lipids by statistical coregulation instead of only relying on univariate analysis or grouping by lipid head groups. This expansion of classic statistical analysis was critical to extend from diagnostic biomarkers (that need correction for multiple testing using FDR adjustments) to revealing underlying biological mechanisms. The axiom of univariate analyses, the mutual independence of variables, is untrue in lipid biology. Moreover, stringent FDR corrections lead to an increased number of false negative results and compromise the statistical power to investigate the biological mechanisms and pathways. As lipids are poorly presented in biochemical pathway databases [19] , classic metabolic pathway enrichment analysis [23] ignores most detected lipids and is unsuitable for lipidomics. Instead, Spearman-rank correlation-based matrices yielded specific clusters of lipids associated with AD phenotypes by using the robust Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for P-value distributions. These lipid sets showed very distinct metabolic features that we identified as preferential use of specific polyunsaturated fatty acids that replaced saturated or monounsaturated fatty acids for distinct lipid classes. These mechanisms of lipid desaturation, elongation, and acylchain remodeling were disturbed in early and later stages of AD. A minimal overlap among lipid sets was observed ( Fig. 3) with respect to statistical associations with AD phenotypes, indicating that quite distinct lipid biochemical processes were involved in the early and later stages of AD. Lipid metabolic pathways associated with the early stage, in particular, may provide new therapeutic targets to stop AD progression. MUFA-containing lipids were positively associated with the brain atrophy and tau accumulation, whereas PUFA-containing lipids were negatively associated with AD diagnosis and cognitive decline. Therapeutic strategies targeting MUFA lipid pathways at the early stages of AD could therefore be potentially more effective in delaying the progression of the disease."}, {"section_title": "Lipids linked to the amyloid beta clearance pathway", "text": "A decrease in the CSF Ab 1-42 peptide marker is indicating a poor clearance of the peptide in the brain, leading to its extraneuronal accumulation. In our study, poor clearance was indicated by negative associations with lipids sets, including sets that contained phosphatidylinositols, lysoPCs, ceramides and choline-plasmalogens and PUFA TGs. The Ab peptide is known to cause mitochondrial dysfunction [24] which can lead to neurodegeneration via autophagic cascades [25, 26] . The associated lipids, specifically ceramides and phosphatidylinositols and lysoPCs have been linked with cell death and may also contribute in the Ab-mediated toxicity in neurons [27] [28] [29] . Higher levels of ceramides containing oleic acid (C18:1) have been shown to increase AD risk [4, 5] . We validate this finding in our study and also observed lower levels of phosphoinositols containing polyunsaturated fatty acids to correlate with poor Ab clearance. An alternative explanation to our data is an impaired Ab clearance in the liver [30] that subsequently leads to dysregulation of lipid metabolism in the liver. Overall, our data suggest that these lipid sets can serve as serum biomarkers for disturbed Ab pathway regulation in brain and can complement Ab imaging assays."}, {"section_title": "Cerebrospinal fluid total tau", "text": "CSF tau is a marker for accumulating tau tangles in the brain tissues, causing neurodegeneration. We found that the total CSF tau marker was significantly associated with lipid sets enriched in monounsaturated fatty acids, acylcarnitines, ceramides, SMs, and EPA-containing phosphatidylcholines. Increased fatty acids and acylcarnitines are known markers of impaired fatty acid beta oxidation in mitochondria [31] , specially during metabolic diseases such as diabetes and obesity [32, 33] . We found free fatty acids and acylcarnitines to be positively correlated with total tau, supporting the notion of tau mediated neurodegeneration and mitochondrial dysfunctions. Mitochondrial impairment was further evidenced by positive associations of total tau with sets of ceramides because accumulating ceramides are known to induce cell death and to increase the AD risk in normal subjects [5] . Higher ceramide levels were also reported for early-stage AD [34] [35] [36] .

We found numerous, very significant associations of omega-3 and omega-6 containing complex lipids with AD diagnosis and cognitive functions. Our analysis is consistent with these results as shown by AD-associated lipids in set 4, set 20, and set 23 (Fig. 4) . We here specify that the major difference is not related to total levels of mono-or polyunsaturated fatty acids, but the extent at which these fatty acids are incorporated into different complex lipids. Clear differences in circulating PUFA phospholipid and PUFA triacylglycerol levels in AD subjects in comparison with normal subjects were observed, likely due to dysregulation of biosynthesis in liver. Here, substrate preference of MGAT and DGAT enzymes in the liver may play an important role, but the exact specificities of acyltransferase enzymes (and their corresponding lipase enzymes) are not well studied. Levels of anti-inflammatory plasmalogens [46] , important lipids for brain membrane functions [44, 47] , were decreased in AD patients in comparison with cognitively normal subjects. Lower levels of plasmalogens have been linked to AD [44] . However, in clinical trials, EPA and DHA supplementation do not improve the cognitive function of AD subjects [48] . Nutritional intervention trials such as the European LipiDiDiet have failed to show any cognitive improvement in AD subjects. A broad-spectrum effect of fish oil supplements on additional lipid pathways may explain the failure of this trial and warrants further lipidomics studies for serum specimens of this trial's participants. It was observed that the incorporation of omega-6 fatty acids was increased in AD subjects. These fatty acids are well-known precursors to proinflammatory molecules such as leukotrienes. Further studies are needed to test if postmortem brain tissues of AD subjects show similar disruption in fatty acid incorporation and if these patterns correlate with AD severity or other AD phenotypes.\nCoregulatory lipid sets and their associations with AD biomarkers will be further tested in reference to a range of covariates including age, BMI, sex, race, diet, and comorbidities in larger cohorts and diverse population settings."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Using coregulated sets of lipids enabled us to find significant associations of lipids with AD that led to biochemical mechanisms.
