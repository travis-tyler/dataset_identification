[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "These technical specifications detail the requirements for hydrographic surveys to be undertaken either by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) field units or by organizations under contract to the Director, Office of Coast Survey (OCS), National Ocean Service (NOS), NOAA, U.S. Department of Commerce. The specifications described herein are based in part on the International Hydrographic Organization's Standards for Hydrographic Surveys, Special Publication 44, Fifth Edition, February 2008, specifically for Order 1a surveys. Hydrographic surveys classified as Order 1a are intended for harbors, harbor approach channels, recommended tracks, inland navigation channels, coastal areas of high commercial traffic density, and are usually in shallower areas less than 100 meters water depth. Additional details for the specific project areas, including any modifications to the specifications in this manual, will be provided in Hydrographic Survey Project Instructions for NOAA field units and contractors or in the Statement of Work (contractors only). Field units should contact the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), Hydrographic Surveys Division (HSD) Project Manager, or Navigation Services Division (NSD) Project Manager to ensure they are using the correct and approved version of any software mentioned in these Specifications. Words used in this manual to denote mandatory or permissive actions are defined as follows: \u2022 \"Shall\" or \"must\" means the procedure or standard is mandatory. \u2022 \"Should\" means the procedure or standard is recommended. \u2022 \"May\" means that the procedure or standard is optional. \u2022 \"Will\" means futurity of action only and does not indicate any degree of requirement for application of a procedure or meeting a standard."}, {"section_title": "Change Management", "text": "A new edition of the Hydrographic Surveys Specifications and Deliverables (HSSD) will be published in quarter two of each fiscal year by HSD Operations Branch.

Change requests by contractors shall be made by contacting the COR who will update the HSSD ticket system. Hydroforum allows for a centralized location to collaborate on and manage HSSD change requests. All proposed changes will be vetted and compiled by HSD Operations Branch and presented to the Chief of HSD for final approval. Approved changes will be enacted and the new version of HSSD will be made available online at https://nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/ publications/standards-and-requirements.html and on the NOAA-internal Navigator site. Any time in the fiscal year there is a crucial need for a HSSD revision before the new edition of HSSD is published, a Hydrographic Technical Directive (HTD) may be issued to modify the current fiscal year HSSD. The Chief of HSD will determine the necessity of an HTD and if deemed crucial, will send an HTD memorandum to all field units indicating the HSSD change, purpose, policy, effective date, and responsibilities."}, {"section_title": "Changes from April 2017", "text": "Several clerical changes have been made in the 2018 Edition of this document. Significant technical and organizational changes are summarized below: "}, {"section_title": "Hydrographer", "text": "The term \"hydrographer\" as used through this document, refers to: (a) the chief of party or officer in charge, when the survey is being conducted by NOAA field units, or (b) the contractor where the work is being performed for NOAA under contract."}, {"section_title": "Navigable Area Survey", "text": "All modern NOAA hydrographic surveys are Navigable Area Surveys, unless explicitly stated otherwise in the Hydrographic Survey Project Instructions. Navigable Area Surveys are basic hydrographic surveys with a restricted inshore limit of coverage. The shoreline depicted on NOAA's nautical charts approximates the line where the average high tide, known as Mean High Water (MHW), intersects the coast and includes the attached cultural features that are exposed at MHW. In addition, nearshore natural and man-made features such as rocks, reefs, ledges, foul areas, aids to navigation, and mooring facilities are typically included in the colloquial definition of \"shoreline. \" NGS Remote Sensing Division (RSD) is responsible for acquisition and compilation of shoreline data, which it provides directly to MCD for nautical chart updates. However, NOAA's hydrographic field parties may be tasked with verifying that shoreline details are adequately and accurately depicted in source data sets and the corresponding nautical charts. The inshore limit of hydrography and feature verification for Navigable Area Surveys is the Navigable Area Limit Line (NALL), unless stated otherwise in the Hydrographic Survey Project Instructions. By default, the NALL is defined as the most seaward of the following: 1. The surveyed 3.5-meter depth contour. Note that in the cases where the 3.5-meter depth contour surrounds a feature (unless explicitly assigned as For Info Only, Section 7.3) disconnected from the contiguous mainland coastline (e.g., offshore islet or rock), the feature shall be investigated utilizing appropriate hydrographic techniques and included in the Final Feature File (Section 7.3). In rare instances, the Chief-of-Party may determine that the NALL lies inshore of the limits defined in 1 and 2. For example, this could be the case in confined waters such as harbors or passes which are inshore of the NALL as defined above, but are regularly utilized by vessels depending on NOAA chart products for safe passage. It could also occur in deep water ports where modern bathymetry is required along wharf faces. In these cases, the Chiefof-Party shall consult with the Chief, HSD Operations Branch or COR, prior to dedicating significant survey resources to these areas. Also, on some occasions the hydrographer may be tasked with investigation of specific items (e.g., Chart Evaluation File items or USCG Aids to Navigation) which fall inshore of the NALL as defined by criteria 1 and 2 above. The hydrographer may also encounter unassigned natural or anthropogenic features inshore of the NALL which are such exceptionally prominent aids to visual navigation that accurate positions for depiction on nautical charts are required. In these cases, the hydrographer shall proceed inshore of the NALL to accomplish investigation of these features, so long as this can be accomplished safely and in accordance criterion 3 above. Note that the hydrographer is not required to extend bathymetric coverage inshore of the NALL when investigating features with vertical extents above MLLW. The hydrographer shall discuss in the Descriptive Report all areas where NALL definition deviated from the default criteria. Note that offshore surveys which do not approach the coast will end at their assigned survey limits. Working near shore is inherently dangerous, and all field units are reminded that safety shall always be the primary consideration when conducting operations. Verification of near shore features should not be attempted unless conditions are favorable. Even though an initial assessment is made by the Chief-of-Party, conditions at the actual survey area may be different or degrade as the day progresses. In such cases, the launch or skiff personnel should defer near shore operations until conditions are favorable."}, {"section_title": "Pre-Survey Assessment", "text": "The Chief of Party / Lead Hydrographer shall complete an informal pre-survey assessment before survey acquisition commences. This assessment shall review and validate the survey requirements in the Project Instructions / Statement of Work (e.g., acquisition method, grid resolution, survey limits, feature verification, etc.) based on conditions observed on the survey grounds and any contact with local stakeholders.

The Office of Coast Survey (OCS) consulted with the NMFS to assess how OCS hydrographic surveying operations and related activities may impact these ESA-listed species and critical habitats. NMFS concluded that OCS hydrographic surveying operations and related activities \"may affect, but [are] not likely to adversely affect\" these resources, if certain Best Management Practices (BMPs) are followed. These BMPs are also broadly protective of marine mammals generally (all marine mammals are protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act).

Timeliness is a critical issue in reporting DTONs. Should additional dangers be discovered during the processing of the survey, they shall be immediately reported."}, {"section_title": "Definition", "text": "A danger to navigation is considered to be any natural feature (e.g., shoal, boulder, reef, rock outcropping) as well as any cultural feature (e.g., wreck, obstruction, pile) which, during the course of survey operations was found by the hydrographer to pose an imminent danger to the mariner or to be inadequately charted as described below. Potential dangers shall be evaluated in the context of the largest scale nautical chart of the area and with detailed knowledge of vessel traffic in the area including usual and seasonal routes. All features with depths of 11 fathoms (66 feet) or less in navigable waters may be considered potential dangers to navigation and subject to reporting. Dangers to Navigation may include: \u2022 Natural or cultural features, either submerged or visible, that pose an imminent danger to surface navigation based on hydrographer's knowledge of the survey area, vessel traffic, and existing cartographic product \u2022 Uncharted or inadequately charted clearances for bridges and overhead cables or pipelines \u2022 Uncharted or inadequately charted (e.g., missing, off station, adrift, destroyed, damaged, leaning, mischaracterized, and if lighted, burning dimly or extinguished) aids to navigation, unless temporary in nature or repositioned frequently (Section 7.3.5). Once all dangers to navigation are identified by using the criteria above, they must be reviewed in context with the largest scale chart covering the survey area. DTONs should not cause undue clutter in relation to other soundings or features on the chart. When multiple distinct features are located within 4 mm of each other, as depicted on the largest scale chart of the area, then the most significant DTON located within the 4 mm radius shall be submitted as a single danger to navigation. Uncharted wrecks that are submitted as DTONs shall be attributed and reported as obstructions in the DTON submission package. These features shall be re-attributed as wrecks in the Final Feature File that is provided in the survey deliverables. This approach ensures that potentially sensitive features are not added to the chart without undergoing review by the State Historic Preservation Officer. Dangers that are too complex to be adequately identified as discrete features shall be depicted as area features. For example, widespread shoaling would be represented as a selection of the shoalest depths with a selection interval of 4 mm at the largest chart scale. If there are no charted depths in the survey area, consult with the HSD/NSD Project Manager or COR, to develop DTON selection criteria appropriate to the navigational use of the area."}, {"section_title": "DTON Submission to Non-NOAA Source Authorities", "text": "NOAA is not the source authority for some charted features such as controlling depths in federal channels, Aids to Navigation (ATONs), bridge heights, and pipelines.

The Charted Feature Removal Request is similar to a Danger to Navigation Report, except it is used to remove a charted feature that represents a hazard, which does not exist, rather than add a newly found hazard. This process should be used sparingly, usually by responding to a request from local pilots or other authorities that a charted feature is a hindrance to operations. If removal of a feature is not time critical, do not use the Charted Feature Removal Request (Anti-DTON). If local authorities request the hydrographer to investigate a feature that has not been assigned, contact HSD/ NSD Project Manager or COR for a determination of the search criteria. Once the hydrographer meets the search criteria and determines the feature does not exist, they should prepare the Charted Feature Removal Request and follow the same submission procedure and format requirements as Dangers to Navigation.

Differential GNSS is the general positioning technique wherein two or more receiver-antenna pairs are used to position an unknown point relative to a known point. Precise Point Positioning (PPP) GNSS is a \"single receiver\" technique that achieves better performance than standalone, non-differential GNSS. Certain PPP techniques employ relative positioning aspects to improve precision. The term DGPS is used herein to refer to the specific class of techniques in differential GPS/GNSS that achieve meter-level positioning. The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) Nationwide (coastal) DGPS and the Federal Aviation Administration Wide Area Augmentation (FAA WAAS) are examples of service providers of this technology, both of which are capable of meeting horizontal positioning standards for NOAA hydrographic surveys. Ellipsoid referenced survey (ERS) 3-D control capable of meeting the more stringent vertical positioning requirements requires an improvement in GNSS positioning control over that afforded by meter-level DGPS. ERS work leverages the family of methods known as kinematic GPS/GNSS (KGPS) and those specialized PPP techniques that better resolve precision."}, {"section_title": "Horizontal Control", "text": "The NOS specification for hydrographic surveys requires the Total Horizontal Uncertainty (THU) in position of soundings shall not exceed 5 m + 5% of the depth, with a confidence level of 95%. The portion of the total uncertainty budget allotted to survey platform (vessel) position depends upon how accurately the sounding is positioned relative to the vessel. THU for soundings obtained by single-beam echosounders may usually be assumed to equal the uncertainty in the horizontal positioning of the vessel transducer (i.e., vessel navigation uncertainty plus uncertainty in transducer offsets). For swath-based (e.g., multibeam) surveys the position of a sounding is usually located some appreciable distance oblique to the vessel position. Total uncertainty must account for beam forming precision of the echo-sounding system, depth of water and water column variability (speed of sound), accuracy of motion compensation (heave,  "}, {"section_title": "Vertical Control", "text": "NOS specification for total allowable vertical uncertainty (TVU) for reduced soundings is detailed in Section 5.1.3, Uncertainty Standards. No intrinsic maximum allowable uncertainty is prescribed for the component attributed to survey platform vertical positioning. The hydrographer shall regard all of the uncertainties which affect vertical positioning, to ensure that the net error does not exceed the allowable limit set for TVU. Because TVU is much more stringent than THU, even more emphasis must be placed on the accounting of the factors which form total uncertainty. See Section 5.2.3, Corrections to Echo Soundings and Uncertainty Assessment, for additional information. Recorded vertical positions with ERS, including values reported in survey records and deliverables, shall retain a precision of centimeters, commensurate with that required for depths as discussed in Section 5.1, General Standards for Depth."}, {"section_title": "Differential GNSS Reference Stations (DGPS & ERS)", "text": "The National Spatial Reference System (NSRS) is realized through the NOAA Continuously Operating Reference Station (NOAA CORS) network.

Non-CORS differential sites in general include differential networks maintained by state and other municipalities, as well as commercial and private systems. Non-CORS differential sites shall utilize existing NOAA, USACE, etc. permanent benchmarks as far as practicable, rather than opting for a temporary mark. Ideally, historic tidal benchmarks shall be used when practicable. The hydrographer shall conduct a certification on non-CORS to ensure that no multipath or other site specific problems exist. The reference position of non-CORS antenna installations shall be verified at least once per week while the site is utilized for survey operations. Verification may be achieved by repeated OPUS sessions to demonstrate that the difference between adopted and check positions are within the error budget allotted per THU (Section 3.2).

Differential and related carrier-phase methods based upon PPP kinematic GNSS methods are permitted, from a real-time kinematic (RTK) service or via postprocessing. Post-processed vertical control has the advantage of enhanced quality control: quasi-independent forward-and reverse-time processing reduces the uncertainty in the vessel height solution otherwise present in RTK-based (forward-only) positioning. GPS is preferred over other GNSS (e.g., GLONASS); however, if the availability of 5 or more GPS satellites is unacceptably infrequent in a particular survey environment, a hybrid GPS-GNSS solution may be leveraged without explicit approval in the Project Instructions/SOW.

However, the errors associated with water level reducers are generally not depth dependent. The portion of the error of the water level reducers must be balanced against all other sounding errors to ensure that the total sounding error budget is not exceeded. The allowable contribution of the error for tides and water levels to the total survey error budget falls between 0.10 m and 0.45 m (at the 95% confidence level) depending on the complexity of the tides. Following the present CO-OPS hydrographic survey error budget analysis procedure for determination of the estimated error at the 95% Confidence Interval (CI): Where b = systematic errors and biases; s = random errors at the one standard deviation level. Systematic errors are additive: Random errors are treated as independent, with the total determined by squaring the individual errors (one standard deviation) and computing the square root of their sum: The total error of the tides and water levels can be considered to have component errors of: 1. Leveling Error: Water level observations must be collected relative to a known vertical reference, called Station Datum. Vertical movement of the water level sensor relative to Station Datum must be measured at an accuracy within 0.012 m. Vertical control must be assessed on a systematic basis and at installation, modification, and removal of the water level sensor. 2. Measurement Error: The instrumentation utilized for water level observations must be able to measure the true mean water level to an accuracy within 0.090 m for each 6 minute observation. Errors resulting from the dynamic effects of waves, currents and water density must also be considered. Gauges/sensors need to be calibrated, and sensor design and data sampling need to include strategies to reduce measurement errors due to waves, currents, temperature, and density effects. The measurements need to be properly referenced to the bench marks and tide staffs, as appropriate and monitored for vertical stability. 3. Data Processing Error: Regular automated and manual quality control is conducted to ensure error introduced through the collection and processing of raw water level data is within 1.0 cm. Data spikes, bad data points and missing data are several examples of how uncertainty can be increased for raw water level observations. A variety of regular automated (e.g., computer algorithms) and manual (e.g., monthly processor verification) quality control steps must be completed to ensure water level observations utilized for downstream products are as accurate as possible. 4.

The shorter the time series, the less accurate the datum, i.e., the bigger the error. An inappropriate control station also decreases accuracy. The NTDE does not apply in the Great Lakes, however the accuracy of datum based on shorter time series is analogous.

Tidal zoning is the extrapolation and/or interpolation of tidal characteristics from a known shore point(s) to a desired survey area using time differences and range ratios.

However, errors for this component can easily exceed 0.20 m if tidal characteristics are very complex, or not well defined, and if there are pronounced differential effects of meteorology on the water levels across the survey area. Project planning by NOS attempts to minimize and balance these potential sources of errors through the use and specification of accurate and reliable water level gauges, and optimization of the use of zoning schemes, control stations, the number of subordinate stations required, and the length of observations required within practical limits of the survey area and survey duration.

Data provided are relative to Chart Datum that MLLW for the 19-year NTDE. The acquisition of water level data from subordinate locations may be required for hydrographic surveys and if so shall be specified by NOS in each individual set of Hydrographic Survey Project Instructions. These stations shall be used to provide 6-minute time series data, tidal datum references and tidal zoning which all factor into the production of final tide reducers for specific survey areas. Station locations and requirements may be modified after station reconnaissance or as survey operations progress. Any changes shall be made only after consultation between CO-OPS and the hydrographer (and Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) if contract survey) as moving required stations to new locations may require new seven-digit station identifier numbers for new or historical station and bench mark information, and/or updated Project Instructions. The duration of continuous data acquisition shall be a 30-day minimum except for zoning stations. Preferably, the duration of continuous data acquisition would be a full calendar month that could significantly reduce the error in the datum calculated. Data acquisition shall be from at least 3 hours before the beginning of the hydrographic survey operations to 3 hours after the ending of hydrographic survey operations, and/or shoreline verification in the applicable areas. Stations identified as \"30-day\" stations are the \"main\" subordinate stations for datum establishment, providing tide reducers for a given project and for harmonic analysis from which harmonic constants for tide prediction can be derived. At these stations, data must be collected throughout the entire survey period in specified areas for which they are required. Levels shall be conducted as soon after installation as is realistically feasible so that at least 30 days of water level data are bracketed by levels. Additionally, supplemental and/or back-up gauges may also be necessary based upon the complexity of the hydrodynamics and/or the severity of environmental conditions of the project area. In areas where lack of data limits CO-OPS' understanding of the tidal regime, it is possible that if insufficient water level data is collected concurrent with the survey, CO-OPS may not be able to provide tide control within the required vertical specification. In non-tidal areas, the correctors for hydrographic soundings are simply water level measurements relative to a specified local low water level datum established for navigational purposes. Laguna Madre, parts of Pamlico Sound, and parts of Florida Bay are examples of such areas classified as non-tidal that have special low water datums. Some river areas also have special datums due to the effects of seasonal changes on the river, e.g., Columbia River Datum (CRD), Hudson River Datum (HRD), or Mississippi River Low Water Reference Plane (LWRP).

CO-OPS' approval of the water level sensor type is mandatory for a NOS project gauges. The reconnaissance for a water level station shall be performed in accordance with references Desktop Reconnaissance Procedure for Observing System Installation Planning and the Field Reconnaissance Procedures for Observing System Installation Planning, both are available in the CO-OPS Field Library at https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/fieldlibrary/Welcome, use keyword \"recon. \" A detailed reconnaissance report is required and shall be submitted 90 calendar days prior to the planned installation. The selected sensors' measurement range shall be greater than the expected range of water level at the measurement site, and the installation shall be designed to measure the full range of extreme water levels, such as the highest observed and lowest observed water level data (100 years, if available). The highest observed may have an additional wave allowance value added as determined by CO-OPS' Engineering Division (ED). Wave allowance information is available to the contractor if requested through the COR. The sensor resolution is also important and is a function of the range of the water level being observed. For a tidal range less than or equal to 5 m, the required water level sensor resolution shall be 1 mm or less. For a tidal range between 5 m and 10 m, the required water level sensor resolution shall be 3 mm or less; and for a tidal range greater than 10 m, the required water level sensor resolution shall be 5 mm or less. Calibration of the gauge/sensor systems prior to deployment is required. The calibration standard's accuracy must be traceable to National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the manufacturer, or an independent reputable laboratory. The calibrations records shall be submitted with the station documentation. The primary water level sensor configured at the majority of CO-OPS water level stations is the Aquatrak\u00ae acoustic sensor with a protective well and parallel plate assembly. The MWWL radar sensor, ParoScientific\u00ae intelligent pressure sensor, or a well/float with absolute shaft angle encoder are other options for water level stations. For short-term subordinate stations, the MWWL sensor is preferred over the pressure sensor whenever possible. At stations where freezing of the water surface, or the lack of a suitable support structures prohibits the installation of the acoustic sensor or a MWWL sensor, then the installation of a single or dual ParoScientific\u00ae intelligent pressure sensor(s) is suitable. For further information, refer to Next Generation Water level Measurement System (NGWLMS) Site Design, Preparation, and Installation Manual, NOAA/NOS, January 1991, available in the CO-OPS Field Library https:// tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/fieldlibrary/Welcome, use keyword \"NGWLMS\". For pressure sensors installations, the orifice shall be mounted on a vertical surface such as a pier or wharf piling so the precise elevation of the orifice below a staff stop can be measured with a steel tape. The elevation of the staff stop will be measured via differential leveling to the nearest bench mark network including the Primary Bench Mark (PBM). If the orifice is mounted vertically and its elevation can be determined precisely with reference to the PBM, then intermittent staff-to-gauge readings may not be necessary. If the orifice cannot be mounted to a vertical surface for direct leveling to the PBM, then staff-to-gauge readings are required to relate the water level data to the bench marks. The requirement for staff-to-gauge readings may also be waived in salt-water environments as described in Sections 4.2.4, if weekly density measurements are taken and submitted to CO-OPS. When using a vented pressure sensor, a series of staff-to-gauge comparisons through a significant portion of a tidal cycle shall be required at the start of a deployment, at frequent intervals during deployment, and at the end of a deployment. Frequent staff-to-gauge comparisons (Refer to Section 4.2.4) during the deployment shall be completed to assure measurement stability and to help minimize processing errors. The staff-to-gauge observations shall be at least three hours long at the beginning and end of the deployment and periodic observations during the deployment shall be at least one hour long. If a pressure sensor is planned, then the reconnaissance shall include a conductivity/temperature/depth (CTD) cast performed in accordance with reference Conductivity/Temperature/Depth (CTD) Observation Analysis available in the CO-OPS Field Library, use keywords \"ctd or conductivity\". The CTD data must be submitted with the reconnaissance report and station documentation. Account for known error sources for each sensor appropriately through ancillary measurements and/or correction algorithms. Examples of such errors are water density variations for pressure gauges, sound path air temperature differences for acoustic systems, and high frequency wave action and high velocity currents for all sensor types. For pressure sensors installations, a parallel plate assembly (with 2\" orifice chamber) is attached to the bubbler orifice to minimize systematic measurement errors due to wave and current effects, as shown in Figure 4.1. The bottom assembly on a bubbler orifice is made of red brass, and its chemical properties prevent the growth of marine life by the slow release of the copper oxide on its metal surface. A Swagelok\u00ae hose fitting is screwed into the top end cap and is used to discharge the Nitrogen gas. The Nitrogen gas flows through the bottom of the orifice at a rate sufficient to overcome the rate of tidal change and wave height. This opening establishes the reference point for tidal measurements. The parallel plates produce a laminar flow across the orifice to prevent the Venturi effect. A two-inch by eight-inch pipe provides the correct volume gas for widest range of surf conditions encountered by most coastal surveys. A bubbler orifice with parallel plates is generally required and shall be used for CO-OPS installations. The DCP shall acquire and store water level measurements every six-minutes. The water level measurements shall consist of an average of at least three minutes of discrete water level samples with the period of the average centered about the six-minute mark (i.e., :00, :06, :12, etc.) The standard deviation of the discrete water level samples that comprise the six-minute measurement shall be computed and stored. The six-minute centered average water level data is required for compatibility with the NWLON stations, and the standard deviation provides valuable data quality information regarding each measurement. The clock accuracy of a satellite radio system shall be maintained within one-second to avoid cross-channel interference. Non-satellite radio systems shall maintain a clock accuracy of within 30 seconds per month.

The data transmissions requirements are applicable where CO-OPS is monitoring the gauges as described in Section 4.1.4 above. The ability to monitor water level measurement system performance for near real-time quality assurance is essential to properly support hydrographic survey operations. Therefore, it is required that, where access to the satellite is available, the measurement system shall be equipped with a Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) transmitter to telemeter the data to NOS as per the assigned frequency slot. The data transmissions must use a message format identical to the format as currently implemented in NOS' NGWLMS. This is required to assure direct compatibility with the NOS Data Management System (DMS). This data format is detailed in the reference document \"NGWLMS GOES MESSAGE FORMATTING\" (refer to Section 4.7). Once the station and gauge information is configured in DMS and station listed on the HHL, the NOS CORMS will monitor all water level measurement system GOES transmissions to assure they are operating properly. Data that is not transmitted by GOES or data transmitted but not in NOS compatible GOES format or is submitted to CO-OPS on electronic formats and must conform to the format specified in the above document so that data can be loaded properly into DMS software.

The staff-to-gauge observations at the start and end of deployment shall be at least each three (3) hours long and the periodic observations during the deployment shall be at least an hour long. The staff-to-gauge observations shall be performed three times per week, during each week of the project, with at least an hour of observations at six-minute intervals. The observations shall be recorded at the same time the gauge is collecting data at the six-minute interval (starting with 0 minutes, e.g., 0, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, and 54 minutes after the hour). Where staff-to-gauge observations cannot be performed three times a week as required, then an explanation is required and CO-OPS ED will grant a waiver, or alternate staff-to-gauge observations will be performed: (a) minimum eight times spread out over each month (e.g., two times per week) and at each time at least 1 hour of observations at 6 minute interval, or (b) minimum of four times spread out over each month (e.g., one time per week) and at each time at least 2 hours of observations at 6 minute interval. The performed staff observations along with the time stamped gauge data, shall be forwarded to CO-OPS ED and the HSD/NSD Project Manager or COR within 15 business days or sooner, if practicable. The staff-to-gauge differences should remain constant throughout the set of observations and show no increasing or decreasing trends. After the water level data has been collected, the averaged staff-to-gauge shall be applied to water level measurements to relate the data to staff zero. A higher number of independent staff readings decrease the uncertainty in transferring the measurements to station datum and the bench marks. Refer to reference number 32 for an example pressure tide gauge record (see Section 4.7). If the staff is found destroyed during the deployment, a new staff shall be installed for the remainder of the deployment and a new staff-to-gauge constant shall to be derived by staff-to-gauge observations. When a staff or an orifice is replaced or re-established, check levels shall be run to minimum of three bench marks including the Primary Bench Mark (PBM). Refer to Section 4.2.6 for leveling frequency and other leveling requirements. When reoccupying historic water level stations, NOS CO-OPS will provide the station datum (SD) information for the station. This information is generally given about the PBM above the historic SD. In that case, for pressure sensors that require staff-to-gauge observations, all the water level data shall be placed on the station datum as detailed in Figure 4.2 and by using the following equation: Water level data on the SD = (Preliminary pressure water level data on an arbitrary datum as collected by the gauge) + (PBM above SD) -(Staff zero below PBM) -(weighted staff-to-gauge constant) Staff zero below PBM = (Staff stop below PBM) + (Staff zero below Staff stop) The staff-to-gauge constant shall be derived as a weighted average of all the staff-to-gauge readings done for the project per deployment. The staff zero below PBM is obtained generally by (a) leveling from PBM to staff stop and (b) then measuring the staff stop to staff zero elevation with a steel tape and (c) then combining the two (a and b) elevation values. The staff zero below PBM is obtained by averaging the elevations differences during the opening (installation) and closing (removal) leveling runs for short-term occupations. At most locations requiring BMPG deployments, a \"virtual tide staff \" procedure may be required. This procedure requires repeat geodetic leveling from a bench mark or temporary bench mark (backsight) to a level rod held at the water's edge (foresight staff shots). The water level shall be read off the level rod scale, taking into account wave action (a small stilling tube attached to the rod helps with this reading). Foresight water level readings shall be made every 6-minute for a three-hour period after initial deployment of the pressure sensors and just prior to retrieval of the sensors. Back sight closures to the bench mark shall be made at the beginning and end of the threehour periods with the leveling instrument set-up remaining undisturbed.

The method works best in regions where there is an abundance of high quality tidal data surrounding the survey area. Just as in discrete zoning, the use of TCARI requires the oceanographer to evaluate and understand the tidal characteristics of the survey areas. Success in both methods requires that tide stations be in operation during survey operations as well as information from historical tide stations and other sources. Gaps in information limit both methodologies. A revised TCARI grid will not be provided for surveys conducted while the required tide gauges are not in operation. TCARI first requires the development of a model grid to cover the survey area. TCARI then requires a spatial field of accepted harmonic constituents from historical stations for the interpolation instead of just the average time and range of tide which tidal zoning requires. Finally, TCARI planning requires an analysis of the non-tidal residual across the survey area to determine the location and number of stations to be in operation during the survey. TCARI grid files, interpolation weighting functions, and harmonic constant files are created during planning and delivered to the survey platform.

The IHO minimum standards for uncertainty are used in the NOS Specifications as a convenient point of reference. When the NOS Specifications refer to an IHO Order, it is usually in terms of the final uncertainty of a depth value. These specifications should not be interpreted to imply that NOAA Hydrographic Surveys \"meet\" a particular IHO survey order overall. NOS standards for Total Vertical Uncertainty (TVU) in hydrographic surveys apply to general water depths and least depths over wrecks and obstructions. By extension, they also apply to the elevations of rocks or other features which uncover at low water and to the measurement of overhead clearances. These standards apply regardless of the method of determination; whether by single beam echo sounder, multibeam echo sounder, lidar, lead line, diver investigation, or other method.

At least 95% of geographically distributed grid nodes shall meet this specification and the percentage of nodes that do not meet the maximum allowable TVU shall be discussed in the Descriptive Report.

However, there may be surveys which require single beam or other sonar-based techniques. Therefore, the standards included in this section will be valid for all echosounding data. Note on Phase Measuring Bathymetric Sonars (PMBS): NOAA's investigation of PMBS systems (also known as interferometric sonars, or Phase Differencing Bathymetric Sonars) has shown that the discrete soundings generated by these systems may have unacceptably high uncertainty for use in nautical charting and that some systems may be incapable of reliably resolving features to the standards required in this manual. If bathymetry generated from PMBS systems is intended to be used to meet these Specifications, the system as used in the survey must demonstrably meet the object detection and depth uncertainty standards and be specifically authorized by the Chief, NOS Office of Coast Survey Hydrographic Surveys Division.

For lidar bathymetry, the archived elevation model should be saved at the highest resolution supported by the sounding data. For example, if the laser spot spacing on the seafloor of a full coverage lidar survey is 3 meters, the elevation model could be saved at a grid spacing of 3 meters. However, if environmental conditions (i.e., kelp, turbidity, or sea state) create differences in data density an alternative approach may be discussed with the HSD/NSD Project Manager or COR and clearly described in the Descriptive Report (DR). This practice has the advantage of preserving this high-resolution data for a variety of known and unknown future purposes, even if such resolution will never appear on a navigational or charting product. Charting products such as paper charts are created from scale-appropriate generalizations of the elevation model. In reality, the final resolution of the surface may be slightly coarser than \"the highest resolution supported by the sounding data\" due to depth ranges, bottom topography and other variables. Refer to Section 5.2.1 for more guidance. See also Section 7.5 for guidance on delineating and characterizing rocky seabed areas.

HSD has determined that the highest resolution the data can support is rarely needed for navigation products. A compromise grid resolution between the highest resolution possible and a resolution required for navigation products has the advantage of preserving high-resolution data for other users without needlessly burdening NOAA field units and contractors. The nautical chart is then created from scale-appropriate generalizations of the Navigation Surface elevation model. The Navigation Surface requires that each sounding has a horizontal and vertical uncertainty estimate. This requires robust, verified error models for all systems which contribute measurements to the final depth solution. These include not only echo sounders, but positioning system, heave, pitch, and roll sensors, sound speed instruments, tide gauges, static and dynamic draft measurements, and anything else that contributes to the calculation of a depth value. Once this comprehensive uncertainty model is assembled, the uncertainties in each measurement may be propagated from the measurement platform to each individual sounding. Only when each sounding has an associated Total Propagated Uncertainty can we combine the soundings into a Navigation Surface with depth and uncertainty attributes for each node. The open source Bathymetric Attributed Grid (BAG) format was developed as an open source exchange format for gridded data. The Open Navigation Surface Working Group (ONSWG) was formed to develop the format. ONSWG is comprised of government and private sector groups.

Precise and accurate measurements are fundamental to the field of hydrography. Synchronization of multiple sensors with the sonar system is essential for meaningful spatial analysis of the data. All measurements, however careful and scientific, are subject to some uncertainties. Uncertainty analysis is the study and evaluation of these uncertainties with the purpose of estimating the extent of them and when necessary, reducing them. An important distinction exists between such corrections to echo soundings measured relative to the in-situ water level (discussed above), to that of 3-D positioning of echo soundings relative to an ellipsoid as is done in ERS hydrography (Section 3.1). In ERS, the height uncertainty of the survey platform encompasses the otherwise individual correctors associated with draft and heave. Additionally, the uncertainty associated with zoned water levels is replaced by uncertainties present in the vertical datum transformation. In recognition of the possibility that some discrepancies in soundings may not be detected until the final processing phase of the survey, the determination and application of corrections to echo soundings must be accomplished and documented in a systematic manner. In addition, all corrections should be applied in such a way that the on-line values may be removed and replaced with a revised set of correctors during office processing. Corrections to echo soundings are divided into five categories, and listed below in the sequence in which they are applied: \u2022 Instrument error corrections account for sources of error related to the sounding equipment itself. \u2022 Draft corrections shall be added to the observed soundings to account for the depth of the echo sounder transducer below the water surface. \u2022 Dynamic draft corrections shall be applied to soundings to correct the vertical displacement of the transducer, relative to its position at rest, when a vessel is underway. \u2022 Speed of sound corrections shall be applied to soundings to compensate for the fact that echo sounders may only display depths based on an assumed sound speed profile while the true speed may vary in time and space. \u2022 Attitude corrections shall be applied to multibeam soundings to correct the effect of vessel motion caused by waves and swells (heave, roll, pitch) and the error in the vessel's heading."}, {"section_title": "Instrument Error Corrections", "text": "In modern digital sounding instruments, instrument errors are generally small and of a fixed magnitude independent of the observed depth.

Draft corrections comprise a value for the draft of the vessel at rest, sometimes known as static draft, and settlement corrections which compensate for the variation in draft that occurs when the vessel is making way.

For depths of 30 m or less, the static draft shall be observed and recorded to at least the nearest 0.1 m. Measurements are required with sufficient frequency to meet this criterion. When sounding in waters deeper than 30 m, the static draft shall be observed and recorded to at least the nearest 0.2 m.

Depth measurements are correspondingly affected by these vertical displacements. The displacements may be of sufficient magnitude to warrant compensation, especially when sounding at moderate to high speeds in shoal water. The factors accountable for this vertical displacement are called settlement. Major factors that influence dynamic draft are hull shape, speed, and depth of water beneath the vessel. Settlement is the general difference between the elevations of a vessel when at rest and when making way. For lower speed, non-planing vessels, settlement is caused by a local depression of the water surface. Settlement is not an increase in the vessel displacement and, therefore, cannot be determined by reference to the water surface in the immediate vicinity. Vessels surveying at higher speeds may experience a negative settlement, or lift, when planing. If a Heave-Roll-Pitch (HRP) sensor is used to determine changes in squat, care must be taken to ensure that squat is not corrected for twice. Conversely, if attitude corrections are not used in single beam data processing, the dynamic draft correction must include any appreciable effects due to vessel trim. Combined effects of dynamic draft at the full range of sounding speeds must be confirmed (i.e., performed and then compared to or averaged with similar past dynamic draft analyses) by the hydrographer at least once a year to at least 0.05 meter precision for each vessel, including launches and skiffs used for hydrographic surveying in shoal or moderate depths. Follow up measurements should be made if there are any major changes to the loading or change to the vessel power plant. When the measurements are made, each vessel should carry an average load and have an average trim. Sounding vessel speeds (or RPM) must be entered in the hydrographic records during survey operations to permit accurate corrections for dynamic draft. The uncertainty value for Dynamic Draft will be dependent on the method that Dynamic Draft was calculated. Typically, several runs at various speeds will be used to calculate the Dynamic Draft. The uncertainty value could then be the standard deviation calculated for each speed measurement."}, {"section_title": "Speed of Sound Corrections", "text": "To ensure that the overall depth measurement accuracy criteria specified in Section 5.1.3 are met, speed of sound observations should be taken with sufficient frequency, density, depth, and accuracy.

First, as in all echosounding, the depth is computed from the product of the speed and the elapsed time between transmission of a sound pulse and reception of its echo. Second, since sound pulses travel at oblique angles through the water column, variations in the speed profile will affect the path of sound through water. The sound path from the transducer to the bottom and back will affect not only the observed depth of water, but the apparent position of the observed sounding. Even though sampling equipment and computer systems are capable of dividing the water column into intervals so small as to allow close approximation of the integral expression for harmonic mean speed, practical limitations may require the hydrographer to use a small number of discrete points on the speed profile for the purpose of correcting echo soundings. If the hydrographer chooses the inflection points of the smooth speed profile as the discrete points for layer boundaries, the speed curve between the points can reasonably be approximated by a straight line. Integration of all the segments using the trapezoidal rule to approximate the area under each layer will yield very accurate results. For multibeam operations, the following specifications apply to sound speed profile frequency and application: \u2022 One sound speed profile shall be acquired immediately before the beginning of the data acquisition period. During the course of survey operations, changes in the water column should be monitored at a sufficient frequency such that the general requirements specified earlier in this section are met.

Any deviations from this requirement will be documented in the descriptive report.

Sound speed correctors must be determined accurately and often enough to ensure that the depth accuracy requirements in Section 5.1.3 are met. The uncertainty value of the sound speed measurements must be part of the vessel's uncertainty model. One method used by NOAA is to use the manufacturers uncertainty values for the measured components of conductivity, temperature and pressure. These values must then be used to compute a total uncertainty for the profile by computing how each component's uncertainty is propagated through the sound speed computations. A probe that measures speed of sound directly could use the manufacturers advertised uncertainty value. Ideally, sound speed uncertainty should be computed based on both the unit's accuracy and the spatial and temporal error associated with sound speed variation over the entire survey area.

For this analysis to be valid, crosslines must be acquired with the same attention to accuracy and data quality as mainscheme data. Whenever possible, crosslines should be acquired under different conditions (vessel, sonar system, tide state, etc.) than main scheme data. The primary purpose of crosslines in a set line spacing coverage area is to identify systematic errors and blunders in the surveying system. Discrepancies between main scheme and crossline coverage indicate potential systematic errors in offsets, biases, or correctors or the application thereof, faulty positioning or echo sounder operation, or other issues.

One hundred percent coverage results in an area ensonified once, and two hundred percent coverage results in an area ensonified twice.

Conduct two separate 100-percent coverages wherein the vessel track lines during the second Contents coverage split the difference between the track lines of the first coverage. Final track spacing is essentially the same as technique 1. Technique 3. Conduct two separate 100-percent coverages in orthogonal directions.

A digital signature, by contrast, appends a cryptographic \"key\" to the document that can be used to verify the identity of the signer (authentication), ensure that no changes have been made to the document since signing (integrity), and ensuring that the signer cannot deny having signed the document (non-repudiation). Until such time as an organization-wide digital signature solution is implemented, the nature of self-signed digital signatures will limit authentication and non-repudiation capabilities of the system.
