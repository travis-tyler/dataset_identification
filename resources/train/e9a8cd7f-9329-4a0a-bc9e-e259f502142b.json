Abstract | Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), which causes lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), is a common diagnosis among the ageing male population with increasing prevalence. Many risks factors, both modifiable and non-modifiable, can increase the risk of development and progression of BPH and LUTS. The symptoms can be obstructive (resulting in urinary hesitancy, weak stream, straining or prolonged voiding) or irritative (resulting in increased urinary frequency and urgency, nocturia, urge incontinence and reduced voiding volumes), or can affect the patient after micturition (for example, postvoid dribble or incomplete emptying). BPH occurs when both stromal and epithelial cells of the prostate in the transitional zone proliferate by processes that are thought to be influenced by inflammation and sex hormones, causing prostate enlargement. Patients with LUTS undergo several key diagnostic investigations before being diagnosed with BPH. Treatment options for men with BPH start at watchful waiting and progress through medical to surgical interventions. For the majority of patients, the starting point on the treatment pathway will be dictated by their symptoms and degree of bother.\nNATURE REVIEWS | DISEASE PRIMERS VOLUME 2 | 2016 | 1 PRIMER \u00a9 2 0 1 6 M a c m i l l a n P u b l i s h e r s L i m i t e d .

Furthermore, as men age, the likelihood of developing associated LUTS increases in a linear manner 6 (FIG. 2) . However, many clinical epidemiological studies use different scales when measuring the severity of BPH depending on the defining terms, which can lead to differing data outcomes of the same disorder. The predictors of BPH progression and complications are outlined in BOX 1. For example, a communitybased study from the Netherlands reported a 19% prevalence for BPH and LUTS in men 55-74 years of age when accounting only for a prostate volume of >30 ml and an International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) of >7 (REF. 7 ). The IPSS is a validated questionnaire to assess LUTS that consists of eight questions, seven of which relate to voiding symptoms (including slow urinary stream, splitting or spraying of the urinary stream, intermittent urinary stream, hesitancy, straining to void and terminal dribbling) or bladder storage symptoms (including increased frequency, urgency and inconti nence), and the last question relates to quality of life (QOL) 8 . However, the prevalence rate dropped to 4% when the maximal urinary flow rate (Qmax) and post void residual (PVR) volume (that is, the volume of urine left in the bladder after micturition) were taken into account 7 . Furthermore, of the 2,372 men who partici pated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III study 9 , 10.7% reported having three or four LUTS symptoms.\nSeveral studies have examined the geographical vari ations in BPH and LUTS prevalence. Men from Southeast Asia have significantly smaller prostate vol umes than men from western countries 10 . Although dif ferences in geographical prevalence for prostate disease (including BPH) have been documented, the reasons for such differences are poorly understood. However, these differences could be due to genetic factors and/or environ mental differences 10 . Furthermore, dynamic changes in environmental factors might also contribute to the development of BPH."}, {"section_title": "Mechanisms/pathophysiology", "text": "The pathophysiology underlying the development of BPH is complicated and poorly understood.

Although many of these risks have not been fully studied, they might be beneficial in provid ing information to assist in counselling of patients and help to form strategies for the prevention and treatment of BPH."}, {"section_title": "Risk factors", "text": "The risk factors for BPH include metabolic syndrome, diabetes, obesity, hypertension, diet and sex hor mone levels. Typically, these factors do not occur in combination, but in certain men they can overlap.\nAge. BPH increases with age, which has been confirmed by numerous studies. For example, in a study of 278 men (mean age at the start of the study: 58 years) enrolled in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging who had undergone at least two MRI scans to determine prostate volume, the median prostate volume was 28.1 ml (range: 4.4-135.0 ml) on the first MRI and 31.1 ml (range: 8.7-237.3 ml) at the end of the study period with a median followup of 4.3 years 11 . It was reported that prostate vol ume increased at a median rate of 0.6 ml per year (range: \u22129.9 to 62.1 ml), which represented a median annual change of 2.5% 11 . Although symptom severity cannot be correlated directly with prostate volume, having a large prostate volume is a risk factor for the development of LUTS. That is, larger prostates are associated with increased risks of urinary retention, increased future need for surgery and clinical progression of BPH 12 .\nThe incidence of LUTS also increases with age. For example, a prospective study examined the inci dence and progression of LUTS in men enrolled in the He proposed that the prostate has four distinct regions: the non-glandular anterior fibromuscular zone (or stroma) and the glandular peripheral, central and transitional zones. Later work by McNeal 145 introduced the anatomical concept of the transitional zone as the principal site of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The size of the prostate remains stable until approximately 40 years of age, after which hyperplasia of the prostate gland typically develops 146 . Histological slides of both a normal prostate and BPH tissue are included. BPH typically exhibits considerable pleomorphism in terms of stromal/epithelial ratio; here, the BPH section shows proliferation of the glandular epithelial cells.\nHealth Professionals Followup Study 6 . The incidence cohort included 25,879 men who were followed up for 16 years, who had not previously had surgery to treat LUTS and had an IPSS of 0-7 on the initial question naire. The progression of LUTS was monitored in 9,628 men who entered the analytic group when they first achieved an IPSS of 8-14 and were deemed to have pro gressed if they required subsequent surgery, subsequent medication use or experienced a rise in IPSS to \u226515. Incidence and progression rates for LUTS significantly increased with age, and progression rates were higher than incidence rates 6 (FIG. 2) .\nMetabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome includes hypertension, dyslipidaemia, glucose intolerance, central obesity and insulin resistance with compensatory hyper insulinaemia 13 . New findings on the development of BPH and BOO support the notion that metabolic syn drome can influence the natural course of these condi tions. For example, in a study of 158 patients with LUTS secondary to BPH, significantly larger prostate glands were observed in men with individual components of metabolic syndrome 14 ; these men also had faster annual prostatic growth than those without components of metabolic syndrome. Specifically, the annual prostatic growth rate was increased by 47% in men with type 2 diabetes mellitus, 17% in men with hypertension, 36% in obese men, 31% in men with low levels of HDL choles terol and 28% in patients with high levels of fasting insulin 14 . A recent metaanalysis on the relationship between metabolic syndrome and BPH reported that patients with metabolic syndrome had significantly higher total prostate volumes than those without 15 . Further meta regression analysis showed that the dif ferences in prostate volume were significantly higher in obese patients, older patients and in those with low serum concentrations of HDL cholesterol. However, no difference was noted between patients with and those without metabolic syndrome for IPSS 15 . Men with LUTS also have significantly higher lev els of glycosylated haemoglobin (indicating poorer control of blood glucose) than men without LUTS 9 . Having three or more components of metabolic syn drome is associated with an increased risk of having LUTS 9 . However, the effect of diabetes on LUTS and, in particular, bladder dysfunction is thought to be multi factorial 16 . Urothelial dysfunction, detrusor physiology and neuronal impairment are involved in bladder dys function and have been reported to occur subsequently in LUTS 17 , complicating the diagnosis of LUTS that is purely related to BPH. Bladder dysfunction related to diabetes can manifest as either detrusor overactivity or poor detrusor function 16 . A similar effect on bladder function can be seen with atherosclerosis and hypo perfusion 18 . Various experimental animal studies have shown that a chronic reduction of bladder perfusion can initially cause detrusor overactivity, but if severe or chronic, bladder underactivity can also occur 18 . These recent studies outline that LUTS related to the different components of metabolic syndrome are multifactorial and cannot be purely attributed to BPH.\nThe evidence to date suggests that sex hormones might also contribute to the association between BPH and metabolic syndrome, but the relationship is com plex and requires further investigation 19 . Indeed, men with BPH and LUTS tend to have low levels of androgens and increased levels of oestrogens; these same patterns are observed in men with metabolic syndrome 13 . One study examined whether metabolic syndrome and the associ ated prostatic changes are prevented by the admin istration of testosterone 20 . Male rabbits fed a highfat diet for 12 weeks all developed hypogonadism and clinical features of metabolic syndrome; fibrosis, hypoxia and inflammation in the prostates were also evident. A sub set of these rabbits was supplemented with testosterone, which normalized the prostatic changes. The data also showed that testosterone played some part in protect ing rabbit prostates from metabolic syndromeinduced hypoxia, fibrosis and inflammation 20 . A study by the same authors 21 looking at BPH specimens from 244 men showed that fat (namely, reduced levels of HDL choles terol and increased levels of triglycer ides) and increased levels of insulin could increase inflammation in BPH and that testosterone counteracts lipidinduced and insulininduced prostatic alterations.\nObesity. Increased levels of adipose tissue have been shown to be associated with greater prostate volume 22, 23 . The effect of obesity on the risk of symptomatic BPH was assessed in 5,667 men enrolled in the placebo arm of the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial 24 . Over a period of 7 years, participants were assessed annually with their weight and body circumferences measured and also had their LUTS evaluated using the IPSS question naire. In the study, 'total BPH' was defined as receipt of treatment or report of two IPSS values of >14 and 'severe BPH' was defined as receipt of treatment or The term lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) is increasingly used to cover the symptoms caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).

Each 0.05 increase in the waisttohip ratio (a measure of abdominal obesity) was associated with a 10% increased risk of total BPH (P < 0.003) and severe BPH (P < 0.02) 24 . Although the underlying physiology of the relation ship between obesity and BPH has yet to be determined, a potential explanation is systemic inflammation. Obesity is one component of the metabolic syndrome, and both are associated with systemic inflammation and oxidative stress 26 . Indeed, several lines of evidence connect BPH to inflammation. For example, the NHANES III study 27 showed that higher levels of serum Creactive protein are associated with an increased risk of LUTS. Furthermore, the presence of inflammation has been implicated as the stimulus that leads to the development of prostate cancer and it is, therefore, assumed that BPH might represent a non malignant pathway that is promoted by oxidative stress and inflammatory mediators 13 . Genetics. To date the vast majority of genetic studies in prostatic diseases have focused on prostate cancer rather than BPH. However, a recent study from China reported that variants in 2q31 and 5p15 are associated with aggressive (defined by multiple criteria) BPH 31 . Another study reported that rs103294, a single nucleotide poly morphism of LILRA3 (encoding leukocyte immuno globulinlike receptor A3), which has been shown to be associated with prostate cancer risk in a Chinese popula tion, was associated with risk of developing BPH"}, {"section_title": "32", "text": ". It was also noted that individuals with risk allele 'C' of rs103294 had increased risk for BPH 32 . The genetic susceptibility of BPH has previously been demonstrated in a cohort of 909 men undergoing prostatectomy for BPH. It was reported that the first degree relatives of men from this cohort had a fourfold increased risk of developing BPH that required surgery compared with the relatives of control men 33 . The mode of inheritance for BPH has been suggested to be auto somal dominant for certain men 34 . Furthermore, twin studies have suggested that heritability is an important determinant of disease severity in BPH, including the development of LUTS. In a study of monozygotic and dizygotic twins, heritability accounted for 82.6% of the variability in IPSS in men >50 years of age 35 . In a simi lar study, the concordance rates for LUTS in 1,723 twin pairs were higher in monozygotic than in dizygotic twins 36 . That study 36 suggested that 72% of the risk of hightomoderate and severe LUTS was attributable to genetic factors."}, {"section_title": "Pathogenesis", "text": "Sex hormones. Testicular androgens are required in the prostate for the development of BPH (FIG. 3) . The enzyme steroid 5\u03b1reductase 2 (also known as 3oxo5\u03b1steroid 4dehydrogenase 2), which is bound to the nuclear membrane, converts testosterone into dihydrotestos terone (DHT), the principal androgen in the prostate accounting for 90% of total prostatic androgen. The levels of intraprostatic DHT continue to remain high with ageing 2 . The stroma and epithelium of the prostate interact via cellular signalling mechanisms mediated by DHT and DHTdependent growth factors 37 .\nDespite the pathophysiological mechanism of BPH not being fully understood, animal and human stud ies suggest that the development of BPH involves the disruption of the DHTsupported homeostasis between cell proliferation and cell death allowing proliferative processes to predominate 38, 39 . It has previously been hypothesized that DHT acts on prostate cells via endo crine, paracrine or autocrine mechanisms 38 and plays a Nature Reviews | Disease Primers Testosterone and its derivatives interact with the androgen receptor (AR), which upon binding translocates to the nucleus and binds to the androgen response element (ARE), promoting the expression of genes encoding various growth factors (including keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF) and insulin-like growth factors (IGFs). In stromal cells, most of the testosterone is converted to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which then acts in an autocrine manner to promote stromal proliferation. DHT can also diffuse into the adjacent epithelial cell to act in a paracrine manner. DHT produced peripherally in the liver and the skin can also diffuse from the circulation into the prostate to act in an endocrine manner. Another site of DHT production is the basal cell (not shown). b | Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) probably develops as a result of an imbalance between mechanisms that regulate cell death and cell proliferation. Growth factors such as KGF, EGF and IGFs, which are AR target genes, are probably involved, as is transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF\u03b2), which is negatively regulated by androgens. In part b, the dashed arrow indicates a less antagonistic effect (than in the left panel) and the double-headed arrows indicate the bidirectional relationship of the growth factors. Part b from REF. 2 , Nature Publishing Group. key part in regulating the homeostasis between apop tosis and cell proliferation 40 . Growth factors stimulated by DHT, including epidermal growth factor (EGF), keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) and insulinlike growth factors (IGFs), modulate cellular proliferation in the prostate in humans 39 . The expression of trans forming growth factor\u03b2 (TGF\u03b2), which modulates apoptosis, is also influenced by DHT 41, 42 . Overall, rather than increased levels or activities of these growth fac tors that contribute to BPH, the interactions between growth factors and steroid hormones might alter the balance of cell proliferation versus cell death to result in BPH (FIG. 3b) . Indeed, in men with BPH and those without BPH, intraprostatic DHT concentrations are maintained with ageing, supporting this notion 39 .\nInflammation. As described above, inflammation in men with BPH can be related to underlying metabolic syndrome and/or obesity. By contrast, an infective aetio logy that triggers the development of BPH and prostatic remodelling has also been suggested, with several stud ies reporting the presence of heterogeneous bacterial and viral strains in BPH biopsy specimens 43 . In the inflammatory state, stromal cells in men with BPH induce the production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemo kines 43 . The link between inflammation and BPH was first described in the 1990s, with extensive infiltration of activated T cells shown in human BPH tissues 44 . T cells are known to secrete various growth factors that promote stromal and glandular hyperplasia of the prostate.\nMore recently, the pathways of specific inflammatory mediators have been studied to assess their potential role in the pathogenesis of BPH. In particular, increased levels of IL2, IL4, IL7, IL17, IFN\u03b3 and their rele vant receptors have been identified in BPH tissue [45] [46] [47] . IL2, IL7 and IFN\u03b3 have been shown to stimulate the prolifer ation of prostatic stromal cells in vitro 48 . Chronic inflammation in BPH has also been associated with focal upregulation of cyclooxygenase 2 in the glandu lar epithelium, generating proinflammatory prosta glandins, which cause prostate cell proliferation 43, 49 . One study profiled tissue microarrays from 282 patients who underwent surgery for BPH 48 ; the majority of the cohort were reported to have had inflammatory cells infiltrat ing BPH tissues. T lymphocyte markers were positive in 81% of specimens, B lymphocyte markers in 52% and macrophage markers in 82% 48 . Patients with highgrade inflammation were noted to have significantly higher IPSS values than those with lowgrade inflamma tion (21 versus 12) and larger prostate volumes (77 ml versus 62 ml) 48 ."}, {"section_title": "Smooth muscle.", "text": "A substantial proportion of the prostate gland is made up of smooth muscle and it is thought that its contractile properties are similar to those of other smooth muscle organs 50 . Both active and passive forces in the prostate tissue have a role in the pathophysiology of BPH. However, the factors that determine passive tone in the prostate are unclear, although the adrener gic nervous system has been reported to regulate active smooth muscle tone 51 . The most common adreno ceptor subtype present in prostate tissue is \u03b11A, which in turn mediates active tension in human prostatic smooth muscle 52 . Stimulation of these receptors results in a dynamic increase in prostatic urethral resistance causing symptoms of outflow obstruction. Previous studies have demonstrated that the density of stromal \u03b11Aadrenoceptors is increased in BPH tissue [53] [54] [55] ."}, {"section_title": "Bladder structure and function", "text": "The bladder is sensitive to conditions such as those imposed by ageing 56 or neurological diseases 57 . For example, BOO caused by BPH has been shown to affect bladder structure and function. The response of the bladder to obstruction is primarily an adaptive one; certain LUTS in men with BPH can be related to changes in bladder function as opposed to obstructive symptoms 58 . In the 1970s, it was shown that, despite sur gical intervention for obstruction due to BPH, approx imately onethird of men continued to have symptoms of voiding dysfunction on inflow cystometry and pressure-flow analysis of micturition 58 . Such changes include both detrusor overactivity and deceased com pliance, resulting in patients experiencing symptoms of frequency and urgency as well deterioration in the strength of the urinary stream and incomplete empty ing. Trabeculation (thickening) of the bladder wall is the predominant endoscopic finding in these patients and has been attributed to an increase in collagen content in the detrusor [59] [60] [61] . The mechanism for this process has been examined in experimental animal models. It has been demon strated that, initially, BOO can lead to the develop ment of smooth muscle hypertrophy in the bladder 62, 63 , which is associated with intracellular and extracellular changes in smooth muscle cells. The changes include altered expression of contractile proteins, abnormali ties of calcium signalling, impaired cell-cell communi cation and mitochondrial dysfunction 62, 63 . Ultimately, smooth muscle aberrations result in detrusor over activity as well as impaired contractility. It has also been shown that hypertrophy in smooth muscle leads to a change in the expression of the myosin heavy chain isoform 64 and to an alteration in the expression of vari ous thin filamentassociated proteins 65, 66 . This finding is in contrast to how skeletal muscle adapts to stress, in which genes encoding contractile proteins are upregu lated -leading to an increase in normally organized contractile units that assemble in the muscle cell 64, 67 . The experimental animal evidence to date suggests that smooth muscle cells revert to a secretory pheno type in response to prolonged obstruction, leading to an increased production of detrusor extracellular matrix (collagen) 63 .\nDiagnosis, screening and prevention As BPH is a common condition affecting a consider able proportion of men, screening and prevention of the disease are not pertinent. However, the rele vant investigations to diagnose the condition are discussed below."}, {"section_title": "Establishing a diagnosis", "text": "Several key diagnostic tools and investigations are used to diagnose BPH in men who present with LUTS. The European Association of Urology and the American Urological Association have published guidelines for the investigation of LUTS related to BPH 68, 69 . The first and most important tool in the assessment and diagnosis of BPH is the medical history of the patient 69, 70 . By taking a detailed history, one can estab lish potential causes and relevant comorbidities of LUTS, some of which might contribute to LUTS. A detailed medication history is also necessary, including life style habits (such as fluid intake). A physical examin ation, including a digital rectal examination (DRE) and urin alysis, is the next step in diagnosis. Further investi gations, such as uroflowmetry and measuring PVR volume, should help to confirm the presence of obstructive symptoms attributable to BPH."}, {"section_title": "Physical examination.", "text": "A physical examination should be performed, particularly focusing on the urinary tract. The suprapubic region should be examined for signs of bladder distension. The penis should be examined for evidence of phimosis, meatal stenosis or abnormal penile lesions, which could account for causes of LUTS 70 . A neurological examination should also be performed on the lower limbs to rule out a possible underlying neurological condition that might result in urinary symptoms. A DRE should be performed on all patients with LUTS. A DRE facilitates the estimation of prostate volume, although less accurately than transrectal ultra sonography (TRUS ; FIG. 4) , and can also assess the shape and consistency of the prostate and identify the pres ence of firm or hard areas or nodules, which can raise suspicions of prostate cancer Frequency charts and bladder diaries. Other tools recom mended for the diagnosis of LUTS caused by BPH include a frequency volume chart (FVC) and bladder diary 72 . For a FVC, the patient measures the volume and time of each void. A bladder diary includes additional information, such as the type of fluid consumed, the use of incontinence pads or activities performed at the time of documentation. Urine production in a 24hour period can vary, therefore, to ensure the accurate completion of the FVC, a period of 3 days is recommended 73 as recording for >3 days increases the likelihood of non compliance 74 . The FVC can also be useful to document if nocturia is the predominant complaint, which indi cates that the patient has a different pathology causing their symptoms 75, 76 .\nUrinalysis. A urine specimen should be collected for analysis to detect material in the urine associated with metabolic disorders, renal dysfunction or urinary tract infections. The European Urological Association guide lines 68 state that, although the evidence for urinalysis is limited, general expert opinion is that the benefits of using it outweigh the costs. Hence, routine urin alysis (either dipstick analysis or microscopic evaluation) must be included in the primary evaluation of a patient presenting with LUTS 70 . The American Urological Association 77 recommends that urinalysis is performed using a dipstick test. Further examination with urinary sediment and culture is necessary if abnormal dipstick findings are noted. If haematuria is noted, appropriate investigations such as cystoscopy and imaging of the renal tract should be carried out according to published guidelines 78 . Apart from noting the presence of leukocytes and nitrite, which are probably indicators of infection, urinalysis also determines the presence of proteinuria, glycosuria and ketonuria. These findings may indicate the presence of a nephrological or an endocrinological condition and should be appropriately investigated by the relevant specialist."}, {"section_title": "Measurement of PVR volume and uroflowmetry.", "text": "Measuring PVR volume in patients with symptoms of BPH can be easily performed by noninvasive trans abdominal ultrasonography. The American Urological Association 77 states that determination of the PVR vol ume is optional in the initial diagnostic assessment and during subsequent monitoring as a safety parameter, whereas the European Urological Association guide lines 70 state that measurement of PVR volume in men with LUTS should be a routine part of the assessment. High PVR volumes (>200-300 ml) 79 might not neces sarily be attributable to obstruction caused by BPH but rather poor detrusor function 80, 81 . A prospective study in 160 men 40-89 years of age compared different param eters, including PVR volume with pressure-flow studies, to detect BOO. The results showed that a PVR threshold volume of 50 ml had a positive predictive value of 63% and a negative predict ive value of 52% to predict BOO 82 . Furthermore, serial measurement of PVR volume might be used to follow up patients with LUTS due to BPH and to identify patients at risk of developing urinary retention 83 . Uroflowmetry is another commonly used non invasive assessment tool for patients with LUTS. The key parameters noted include the Qmax, flow pattern and volume voided. As Qmax is prone to withinsubject vari ation 84, 85 , it is recommended that at least two flow rates should be obtained, both with a >150 ml of urine voided 77 ."}, {"section_title": "Reynard et al.", "text": "86 studied 1,271 men 45-88 years of age in 12 centres worldwide over a 2year period, analysing symptom questionnaires, voiding diaries, uroflowmetry and pressure-flow data. They reported that a Qmax of <10 ml per second had a positive predictive value of 70% for BOO 86 . As for PVR volume, uroflowmetry is often used for monitoring treatment outcomes 70 .\nProstate-specific antigen test. The level of prostate specific antigen (PSA) has been shown to reflect pros tate volume 87 . One communitybased study from the Netherlands showed a 72% chance of having a prostate volume of >30 ml when the serum PSA level was in the range of 2.1-2.5 ng per ml 87 . The higher the PSA level, the greater the likelihood of an enlarged prostate -with a 69% chance of having a prostate volume of >40 ml with a PSA level of 4.1-7.0 ng per ml 87 . An analysis of the pooled placebocontrolled BPH trials also reported that the PSA level has a good predictive value for assessing prostate vol ume 88 . However, PSA testing should not be routine; the benefits and risks of testing should be discussed with the patient 89 . In particular, the test is used in prostate cancer diagnostics, therefore, the possibility of a need for a prostate biopsy and associated risks should be discussed. The European Association of Urology 70 recommends that PSA testing should only be performed if it can assist in decision making in patients at risk of BPH progression."}, {"section_title": "Other important clinical considerations", "text": "As a result of the obstructive symptoms caused by BPH, damage to the upper tracts (ureters) can occur -leading to hydronephrosis (in which the kidneys become swollen with urine) and possible deterioration in renal function.\nRenal function. Renal function can be assessed by measur ing the levels of serum creatinine or estimated glo merular filtration rate (GFR), which must be performed if renal impairment is suspected 70 . Renal impairment can be suspected on the basis of history or clinical examination. Urinary retention, hydronephrosis and renal insuffi ciency are more common in patients with obstructive symptoms due to BPH 90 . Approximately 11% of men with LUTS have renal insufficiency; however, diabetes mellitus or hypertension are the most likely causes of the increased creatinine concentration in this group 90 . In addition to these factors, advancing age also has a role in the loss of kidney function, with progressive decreases in GFR and renal blood flow with ageing 91 92, 93 . A study of renal ultrasonography in 556 consecu tive patients with BPH concluded that only patients with increased levels of creatinine require ultrasono graphy of the kidney 94 . Men with BPH who are due to undergo surgery for the management of symptoms will have their renal function assessed because patients with renal insufficiency are at an increased risk of developing postoperative complications 95 ."}, {"section_title": "Urinary tract imaging.", "text": "The routine use of upper tract imaging is not recommended for patients with BPH 70, 77 ; however, it might be necessary in patients who have a urinary tract infection, urolithiasis, renal insufficiency and/or haematuria. Patients with LUTS and haematuria should be investigated according to published guide lines 78 . The prostate can be imaged by several modalities including TRUS, CT and MRI 70 . TRUS or transabdom inal ultrasonography are the most easily performed, although TRUS is more accurate for assessing prostate volume 96, 97 . TRUS is also useful in determining the degree of intravesical prostatic protrusion, which is the distance between the bladder neck and the tip of the prostate median lobe. The degree of intravesical prostatic protru sion has been shown to correlate with the severity of BOO on urodynamics, with a positive predictive value of 94% 98 . Routine use of urethrocystoscopy is not required for patients with uncomplicated LUTS (which include those without a history of urinary tract infections, haematuria, bladder stones, predominantly irritative symptoms or a secondary pathology such as bladder cancer) according to the American Urological Association 77 . However, patients with a history of microscopic or macroscopic haematuria should be investigated appropriately with urethrocysto scopy as per guidelines 78 . Patients who have suspected anatomical abnormalities, such as a urethral stricture, might require urethrocystoscopy as such findings might change the type of treatment recommended 70 .\nPressure-flow studies. Although not necessary in the routine assessment of patients with BPH, urodynamic pressure-flow studies might be necessary to measure the relative contribution of the bladder and the prostate to lower urinary tract dysfunction. Pressure-flow studies are the only method to determine if LUTS are due to BOO or due to an underactive detrusor. A reported 11-40% of men with LUTS have evidence of detrusor under activity on urodynamics 99, 100 . The European Association of Urology 70 recommends that men <50 years of age or those >80 years of age who are being considered for surgery should undergo pressure-flow studies. Those patients with a Qmax of >10 ml per second should also be considered for pressure-flow studies when surgical intervention is being explored. If a patient had a previous unsuccessful surgical treatment for BPH, pressure-flow studies should be performed to assess detrusor function. In addition, when considering surgery, pressure-flow studies can be used in patients who cannot void >150 ml on uro flowmetry or who have a PVR volume of >300 ml. Patients with a history of previous radical pelvic surgery should be assessed appropriately with pressure-flow studies before intervention 101 ."}, {"section_title": "Management", "text": "Treatment options for men with LUTS start at watchful waiting and progress through medical to surgical inter ventions. For the majority of patients, the starting point on the treatment pathway will be dictated by their symp toms and degree of bother. In a minority of patients, the presence of complicating factors, such as urine retention, bladder stones or renal impairment, will necessitate a moreaggressive approach that is independent of symp toms. Determination of prostate volume can be useful before selecting the type of treatment that is suitable for a patient; a surgeon will consider prostate volume before proceeding with transurethral resection (in which the prostate tissue is removed through the urethra), enucle ation or, in some cases, an open prostatectomy for patients with considerably large prostates."}, {"section_title": "Watchful waiting", "text": "Patients with mild symptoms (IPSS of \u22647) and no com plicating factors or those with moderate symptoms and minimal bother can be managed with watchful waiting. Watchful waiting includes advice about lifestyle changes that can help to ameliorate or circumvent symptoms. These changes include advice about volume, type and timing of liquids consumed, avoidance of caffeine (a diur etic), abstinence of alcohol consumption in the evening and regulation of bowel movements with avoidance of constipation 70 . Overthecounter 'decongestants' com monly used for cold and flu symptoms should also be avoided as they can exacerbate symptoms owing to their \u03b1adrenergic agonist effects at the bladder neck causing urinary retention 102 . Although watchful watching avoids the risks and costs associated with medication and surgi cal procedures, patients should be warned that symptoms can worsen overtime. A longitudinal study over a period of 4 years, which involved almost 400 men, demonstrated that the cumulative clinical progression rate was 6%, 13%, 15%, 24%, 28% and 31% at 6, 12, 18, 24, 36 and 48 months, respectively; 4.9% of men developed acute urinary retention within the 48month followup period 103 ."}, {"section_title": "Medical therapy", "text": "The aim of medical therapy is to improve symptoms, lower the risk of progression and improve QOL. There are many pharmaceutical options, with guidelines and algor ithms readily available to help guide selection 68 (FIG. 5) .\nDifferent categories of medical therapies are used for LUTS due to BPH, including those used to reduce BOO and to treat bladder overactivity.\nAs described, the pathophysiology of BOO in men with BPH has been attributed to both static (prostatic tissue) and dynamic (smooth muscle) factors. As the \u03b11Aadrenoceptor is the predominate receptor in prostate stromal smooth muscle 104 , medical therapies target this and other adrenergic receptor subtypes (namely, the \u03b11Badrenoceptor and the \u03b11Dadrenoceptor). Blockade of these \u03b11Aadrenoceptors (which are also expressed to some extent in the bladder neck) results in smooth muscle relaxation and subsequent improvement in the passage of urine. Selective \u03b11adrenergic antagonists, including tamsulosin and silodosin, are often regarded as first line medical therapy for men with LUTS. Tamsulosin exhibits a modest degree of selectivity for the \u03b11A adrenoceptor versus the \u03b11Badrenoceptor, whereas it shows no selectivity for the \u03b11Aadrenoceptor versus the \u03b11Dadrenoceptor 105 . Silodosin shows 162/1 selectivity for \u03b11Aadrenoceptors versus \u03b11B adrenoceptors 106 . Both drugs can produce rapid and considerable improvement in symptoms within 3-4 days of treatment initiation and this benefit is durable for >12 months 68 . Symptom improve ment has been shown to be associated with increased Qmax, increased bladder capacity and decreased detrusor overactivity 107, 108 . The main adverse effect for both drugs is relative anejaculation 109 . The nitric oxide-cyclic GMP (cGMP) pathway is another pathway involved in smooth muscle contractil ity. Phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) negatively regulates smooth muscle contraction by hydrolysing cGMP (which is crucial to muscle relaxation via its effects on intra cellular calcium levels). Accordingly, inhibition of PDE5 leads to the relaxation of smooth muscle in the bladder neck, urethra and prostate 110 . PDE5 inhibition possibly increases tissue perfusion, modulates autonomic nervous system activity and inhibits the prostatic inflammatory process, all of which lead to an improvement in voiding symptoms 111 . Changes in uroflowmetry parameters are less clear; some studies show no change upon PDE5 inhib ition 112 , whereas others have documented an improve ment 111 . A recent metaanalysis reported that the use of PDE5 inhibition alone was associated with a significant improvement in IPSS values as well as in International Index of Erectile Function scores but not Qmax 113 . This finding supports the use of PDE5 inhibitors in men with LUTS related to BPH who might or might not also have erectile dysfunction. The lack of improvement in Qmax in these men might be attributable to the PDE5 inhib itor tadalafil, which decreases detrusor pressure without profoundly changing Qmax 114 . Another possible treatment target is DHT levels in the prostate. Steroid 5\u03b1reductase inhibitors (such as finas teride and dutasteride) block the conversion of testoster one to DHT, resulting in shrinkage of the prostate. The benefits of these drugs take 4-6 weeks to become evident; 3-6 months of treatment are needed for maximal effect 68 . With increasing BOO, the bladder can become unstable, leading to urinary urgency and frequency. In men with LUTS and small PVR volumes (FIG. 5) , the use of muscarinic receptor antagonists can provide relief. Muscarinic receptors are involved in the modulation of detrusor contractility; inhibition of these receptors reduces smooth muscle tone and relieves symptoms. Although human detrusor has been shown to contain all five types of muscarinic receptors, M2 and M3 recep tors predominate (with the M2 subtype outnumbering the M3 subtype by three to one) 115, 116 ; detrusor contrac tion is primarily controlled by M3 receptors 117 . Available agents include nonselective antagonists, such as oxy butynin, and selective antagonists, such as solifenacin and tolterodine. Solifenacin is more selective for the M3 receptor than the M2 receptor 118 . Tolterodine exhibits selectivity for the urinary bladder over salivary glands. For patients who have a poor response to antimuscarinic drugs or who have previously experienced adverse effects with these drugs, agonism of the \u03b23adrenoceptor might be an alternative treatment option. Indeed, mirabegron (a \u03b23adrenoceptor agonist) has recently been made available for this indication in the United States and Europe 119 . Stimulation of the \u03b23adrenoceptor results in detrusor relaxation and relieves symptoms.\nCombining agents that target different pathways can be useful\n. For example, the combination of dutasteride and tamsulosin has been shown to not only produce durable improvements in voiding symptoms but also results in a significant reduction in the risk of disease progression; in particular, the time to first epi sode of acute urinary retention or BPHrelated surgery was significantly lower with combination therapy ver sus tamsulosin treatment alone 120 . Furthermore, one study showed that the combination of tamsulosin and tadalafil provided a significant improvement in IPSS, bladder storage and voiding symptoms over tamsulosin alone 114 . A metaanalysis on the use of PDE5 inhibition with \u03b11adrenergic antagonists showed improvements in IPSS, Qmax and the International Index of Erectile . Here, we provide a simple algorithm that captures the majority of patient and clinical findings, and reflects the consensus of the most recent (2016) European Association of Urology guidelines 68 on conservative and/or medical treatment. Patients can be observed with watchful waiting with advice on education and lifestyle or, if necessary, commenced on medication dependent on their symptoms. Those with predominant voiding symptoms can benefit from treatment with an \u03b11-adrenergic receptor antagonist or possible combination treatment of an \u03b11-adrenergic receptor antagonist with a steroid 5\u03b1-reductase inhibitor. Recent evidence has also suggested that treatment with a phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor might benefit those with predominant voiding symptoms. Patients with predominately storage symptoms might require an anti-muscarinic agent and/or a \u03b23-adrenoceptor agonist. This algorithm also recommends identifying patients for whom nocturnal polyuria is the predominant symptom. In addition to conservative management, these patients might require medical treatment with a vasopressin analogue.

Another metaanalysis reviewed the evidence combining \u03b11adrenergic antagonists with antimuscarinic agents, concluding that combination therapy significantly improved storage symptoms com pared with \u03b11Aadrenergic antagonist therapy alone but was associated with a small risk of increased PVR volume, decreased Qmax and the development of urinary retention 121 ."}, {"section_title": "Surgery", "text": "Many surgical options are available for men with BPH and they can be classified into three main groups: com pressing the prostate tissue, debulking of the adenoma and removal of the entire adenoma (adenectomy). 123 . Owing to its tissuesparing approach, this procedure seems to be promising in minimizing the comorbid ities of other BPH treatments and is able to considerably improve LUTS 124 . Furthermore, unlike ablation treatments, prostatic urethral lift has the added benefit of preserving sexual function 124 . Clinical studies conducted show statistically and clinically significant improvements in QOL and symptom scores in men with LUTS 123 . In comparison with a sham treatment, prostatic urethral lift showed an improvement in IPSS and Qmax 123 . After 2 years of follow up, prostatic urethral lift showed stability and durability with a mild adverseeffect profile -with postoperative dysuria, discomfort, urgency and haema turia resolving quickly 123 . However, research is ongoing to assess the longterm results.\nAdenoma debulking. Debulking surgery involves the endoscopic removal of some of the adenomatous component that obstructs the outlet. Although trans urethral resection of the prostate (TURP) is tradition ally conducted with monopolar diathermy (in which a highfrequency electric current is delivered to generate heat to resect the tissue), several other options are now available\n-including bipolar diathermy (Gyrus), laser (photoselective vaporization of the prostate (PVP)) and microwave. Bipolar diathermy has the advantage of enabling resection with saline irrigation. GreenLight laser vaporization 125 , which also uses saline irrigation, has the additional advantages of being able to be per formed while patients remain on anticoagulation ther apy and is often performed as a day patient procedure. Microwave treatment can also be performed as a day patient procedure with minimal adverse events 126 .\nDespite these advances, standard monopolar dia thermy TURP is still regarded as the goldstandard pro cedure for debulking. A metaanalysis reported that the efficacy of PVP was similar to TURP at 6 months with regards to Qmax, PVR volume and IPSS outcomesmaking PVP a promising minimally invasive technique 127 .\nAdenectomy. The traditional approach and one of the oldest techniques to treat men with BPH and very large prostates (usually >100 ml) was open simple prostatec tomy or adenectomy 68 . For this approach, the adenoma is enucleated (removed whole) off its capsule. Traditionally, adenectomy was an open surgical operation but can now be achieved with less morbidity with laser enucleation of the prostate transurethrally 128 . A metaanalysis showed that men treated with holmium laser enculeation of the prostate (HoLEP) had a better Qmax at 3 months and 12 months than those treated with TURP; PVR vol ume was also reduced at 6 months and 12 months and the IPSS was lower at 12 months with HoLEP. HoLEP and TURP had similar postoperative complications rates, but HoLEP had a lower blood transfusion rate 129 . However, HoLEP is regarded as a more difficult proce dure for the surgeon to master and requires the appro priate technology to perform, and is not available at all centres.\nQuality of life BPH can have a considerable effect on the QOL of a patient and on determining the degree that impairment forms part of the initial evaluation of these patients and informs treatment decisions.

The American Urological Association Symptom Index questionnaire and the IPSS contain identical questions related to symptoms; however, the IPSS contains a specific ques tion relating to QOL: \"If you were to spend the rest of your life with your urinary condition just the way it is now, how would you feel about that?\" (REF. 130 ). From the current literature, the impact of BPH on a patient's QOL is clearly evident -with worsening symptoms result ing in an overall deterioration in QOL. From a patient's perspective, improvement of QOL and, in particular, the degree of bother they experience will probably form the main reason to seek treatment 131 . The effect that BPH has on QOL has been compared with other disease conditions. When comparing stud ies that used the EQ5D \u2122 general health questionnaire (EuroQoL), BPH had a similar influence on QOL as epil epsy requiring surgery and asthma 131 . By comparison, the Medical Outcomes Study 36Item ShortForm Health Survey (SF36) questionnaire revealed that patients with BPH had a worse QOL in all domains except physical functioning than patients with chronic obstructive pulmo nary disease 131 . The effect of BPH on QOL has also been reported in a multicentre observational study that included >800 patients 50-80 years of age. The study sought to investigate the relationship between different lifestyle factors, prostaterelated vari ables and symptom severity 132 . It was concluded that the strongest association between the IPSS and all variables assessed was found for QOL. That is, patients with moresevere symptoms that affected activities of daily living ultimately had a lower QOL 132 . The partners of patients with BPH have also been shown to be affected; one survey of 50 couples for whom the male partner had BPH revealed that the female part ner experienced morbid ities such as sleep disturbance, disruption to social life and an increasing psychological burden 133 . Another study demonstrated that the degree of morbidity experienced by the partner was related to the severity of the patient's symptoms 134 .\nVarious studies have supplemented the IPSS with questionnaires to demonstrate the effect of BPH on a patient's QOL. For example, the BPH Impact Index comprises four questions and was developed to assess the negative effect of BPH on health status as well as the effect on everyday life and daily activities 8 . It has been used in conjunction with the American Urological Association Symptom Index to show the improvement in QOL with medical treatment for BPH 135 . Hunter et al. 136 used the general SF36 to demonstrate a deterioration in QOL as well as in general health status with increasing LUTS. In that study 136 , 217 men \u226555 years of age with LUTS were surveyed; between 9% and 49% of those with moderate or severe urinary symptoms reported interference with some of their daily activities. The SF36 has also been used to demonstrate that patients with severe symptoms awaiting surgical treatment for BPH experience a poor healthrelated QOL 137 . In a longitudinal observational trial, Thomas et al. 138 quantitatively compared the impact of admission for an episode of acute urinary retention with that of elective surgery for BPH and/or an emer gency presentation to hospital with renal colic. Using various QOL instruments and parameters, acute urinary retention was deemed to impose high pain scores and substantial economic burden on patients 138 ."}, {"section_title": "Outlook", "text": "Although recent trials have looked into the effects of different combinations of existing medications to better manage BPH (and LUTS), surgery is arguably the most exciting developing area in BPH.

The water jet ablates the prostate tissue under mechanical control and high energy is delivered to the desired area to produce \"an energy efficient and precise surface haemo stasis\" to ablate the tissue 139 . This technique enables physi cians to preserve blood vessels and the prostate capsule while removing the obstructing tissue. Aquablation might be feasible with varying prostate sizes 139 .\nFaber et al. 139 tested the efficacy and safety of aquablation in a canine model; following treatment, a 6week postoperative histo logical evaluation revealed no major change in cellu lar architecture, implying its safety for the prostatic urethra. In humans, a singlecentre, prospective, non randomized trial involving 15 men who reported having moderatetosevere LUTS showed no adverse events for aquablation 140 .\nIn that study 140 , the mean age of the patients was 73 years (range: 59-86 years) and the mean prostate volume was 54 ml (range: 27-85 ml). Importantly, the mean procedure time was 48 minutes with the actual aquablation treatment used for 8 minutes. A significant reduction in IPSS was noted -from 23.1 at baseline to 8.6 at 6 months followup. Qmax also improved signifi cantly from 8.6 ml per second at baseline to 18.6 ml per second at 6 months 140 . Furthermore, patients experienced a 31% reduction in prostate size at 6 months. Notably, the authors reported no cases of urinary incontinence or erectile dysfunction. These preliminary results demon strate that aquablation is safe and comparable with existing surgical treatments.\nAnother therapy under development is prostate artery embolization (PAE), which is a minimally invasive pro cedure in which the inferior vesicle artery is ablated in a superselective manner using hydrophilic micro catheters and polyvinyl alcohol 141 . Polyvinyl alcohol consists of microparticles that, when released into the blood vessels, cause occlusion of the vascular bed, leading to ischae mic necrosis of the prostate. In turn, the prostate shrinks and LUTS are improved 142 . In a study of 255 men with BPH who underwent PAE, 98% technical success (that is, embolization of the prostatic artery) was achieved with bilateral PAE in 82% of patients, with unilateral PAE achieved in 18% of cases owing to tortuosity and athero sclerotic changes of the iliac arteries preventing bilateral embolization 143 . Clinical success was deemed as an IPSS reduction of at least 25% of the total score (<18 points overall) and a reduction of \u22651 point (or \u22643 points overall) in the QOL domains of the IPSS. Patients were followed up for a mean of 10 months (range: 1-36 months) with clinical success rates of 80.7%, 75.2% and 72% at 3, 12 and 36 months, respectively 143 . These treatments only highlight that a select few options are coming along the pipeline for the treatment of individuals with BPH. Time will tell which patients will benefit from these therapies as well as the durability of the different treatments. This experimental animal study reported the protective effect of testosterone on metabolic syndrome-induced prostatic hypoxia, fibrosis and inflammation, which can play a part in the development of BPH and LUTS.
