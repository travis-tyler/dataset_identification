[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains the most common cause of dementia and is characterized by cognitive impairment, particularly in salient amnestic symptoms (Rogan and Lippa, 2002; Mucke, 2009 ). However, AD-related pathological processes, mainly including intracellular neurofibril tangles (NFTs) and extracellular amyloid deposition, begin years even decades before the appearance of clinical symptoms. Recently, the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) has considered that amyloid (A) and tau (T) biomarkers indicate specific neuropathologic changes of AD, and proposed a new biological definition: individuals with biomarker profile ''A+T+'' (both abnormal A and T biomarkers) would be defined as AD (Jack et al., 2018) . On the one hand, this definition could be helpful to exclude other diseases relating to cognitive impairment; on the other hand, this definition may detect subjects with AD-associated pathology in an early stage. However, different cognitive stages are present in the population among the people defined as biological AD. Individuals with biomarker profile ''A+T+'' could be subdivided into three categories: (1) preclinical AD (A+T+, cognitively unimpaired); (2) prodromal AD [A+T+, mild cognitive impairment (MCI)]; and (3) AD with dementia (A+T+, dementia; Jack et al., 2018) . It remains unclear why individuals with existed AD pathology show different cognitive statuses.\nResting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) has revealed different patterns of spontaneous brain activity in patients with AD and MCI in a sensitive way. Notably, findings from several studies were contradictory. For example, some studies have found significantly decreased amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) in parahippocampal gyrus (PHG), superior temporal gyrus (STG) and postcentral gyrus in AD patients (Liu et al., 2014; Cha et al., 2015; Zheng et al., 2018) , whereas some have reported increased ALFF in these regions . Inconsistent results could also be found in studies focus on patients with MCI Xi et al., 2012) or amnestic MCI (aMCI; Han et al., 2011; Cai et al., 2017; Pan et al., 2017) . We considered that the heterogeneity of patients, particularly suspected non-Alzheimer's pathology, may confound neuroimaging results to some extent. Therefore, combing the AD biological definition described above and rsfMRI measures may be helpful to find more reliable brain activity change due to AD.\nIn the current study, we aimed to investigate different brain activity patterns among subjects labeled as preclinical AD, prodromal AD and AD with dementia (d-AD). We measured spontaneous brain activity via a fractional ALFF (fALFF) approach (Zou et al., 2008) . This approach could improve the sensitivity and specificity in detecting regional spontaneous brain activity compared to ALFF (Zou et al., 2008) , and has been widely used in major depressive disorder (Cheng et al., 2017; Qiu et al., 2019) , schizophrenia (Hoptman et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2018 ), Parkinson's disease (Tang et al., 2017; Guo et al., 2018) and other neuropsychiatric disorders."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database 1 . The ADNI was launched in 2003 by the National Institute on Aging (NIA), the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), private pharmaceutical companies, and non-profit organizations, as a $60 million, 5-year publicprivate partnership. The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial MRI, positron emission tomography (PET), other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of MCI and early AD. Determination of sensitive and specific markers of very early AD progression is intended to aid researchers and clinicians in developing new treatments and monitor their effectiveness, as well as lessen the time and cost of clinical trials.\nEvery subject has cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, high resolution T1-weighted 3D images and rsfMRI images approximately at the same time. Based on previous CSF biomarkers cut-off value, amyloid-\u03b2 42 (A\u03b2 42 ) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) levels were considered abnormal if \u2264192 ng/L and \u226523 ng/L, respectively (Shaw et al., 2009 ). Finally, we defined 11 cognitively unimpaired subjects with biomarker profile ''A\u2212T\u2212'' as healthy controls (HC). According to cognitive performance, we identified 75 individuals labeled as ''A+T+,'' and classified into three groups: 22 preclinical AD (cognitively unimpaired), 33 prodromal AD (MCI), and 20 d-AD (dementia)."}, {"section_title": "CSF Samples and Quantification", "text": "CSF data were downloaded from the ADNI. Levels of A\u03b2 42 , t-tau and p-tau were measured from CSF samples, which were obtained using the standardized ADNI protocol, as previously described (Shaw et al., 2011) ."}, {"section_title": "Image Acquisition", "text": "All participants were scanned using a 3.0-Tesla MRI scanner. The structural image was acquired using a 3D T1-weighted sequence with the following parameters: axial orientation, 2,300 ms TR, 2.98 ms TE, 900 ms TI, 9 \u2022 FA, each 1.2 mm in thickness. The rsfMRI scans were obtained using an echo-planar imaging sequence with the following parameters: 140 time points; TR = 3,000 ms; TE = 30 ms; flip angle = 80 \u2022 ; number of slices = 48; slice thickness = 3.3 mm; spatial resolution = 3.31 \u00d7 3.31 \u00d7 3.31 mm 3 ; matrix = 64 \u00d7 64. According to the human scan protocol of the ADNI database, all subjects should keep their eyes open with fixation (focus on a point on the mirror) during the entire fMRI scan."}, {"section_title": "Imaging Data Preprocessing and fALFF Calculation", "text": "We pre-processed rsfMRI data using the Data Processing and Analysis for (Resting-State) Brain Imaging, DPABI 2 (Yan et al., 2016) with Statistical Parametric Mapping 12, SPM12 3 on the MATLAB platform (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA). The first 10 image volumes of functional images were discarded for the signal equilibrium and subject's adaptation to the scanning noise. The remaining 130 images were corrected for timing differences between each slice and head motion (Friston 24 parameter) . The structural MR images were segmented into gray matter (GM), white matter (WM) and CSF using SPM12. Subsequently, based on rigid-body transformation, the T1-weighted image was co-registered to the mean rsfMRI image and spatially normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) stereotactic space, then re-sampled them into of 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 mm 3 cubic voxels. We removed linear trends and regressed out covariates, including Friston 24 head motion parameters, a signal of WM and CSF signal. The functional images were spatially smoothed with a Gaussian kernel of 6 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 6 mm 3 full widths at half maximum to decrease spatial noise. Finally, data were scrubbed to further reduce motion-related artifacts by using a frame-wise displacement (FD) threshold of 0.5, with which ''bad'' time points were deleted. In this study, we excluded two preclinical AD group, one prodromal AD, and 6 d-AD due to excessive head motion (>3.0 mm maximum displacement in any of the x, y, or z directions or >3.0 \u2022 of any angular motion).\nThe preprocessed functional images were imported into the DPABI toolbox (Yan et al., 2016) to calculate fALFF. In particular, the time series were first converted to a frequency domain with a fast Fourier transform, and the power spectrum was obtained. The square root of the power spectrum was computed at each frequency of the power spectrum, and the averaged square root was obtained across 0.01-0.08 Hz at each voxel. Finally, the fALFF was calculated as the ratio of the low-frequency power spectrum to the power spectrum of the entire frequency range (Zou et al., 2008; Yan et al., 2016 "}, {"section_title": "Statistical Analysis", "text": "Regarding demographic data, we used the analysis of variance (ANOVA) to compare the age, education, neuropsychological scales and CSF biomarkers among four groups; subsequently, we performed the post hoc two-sample t-test. The Chi-square test was used for gender distribution difference assessment (p < 0.05).\nBased on the DPABI toolbox, we used the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to detect the whole-brain fALFF differences among HC, preclinical AD, prodromal AD, and d-AD groups, corrected by age, gender, education and mean FD. The clusters with significant between-group differences were defined as ROIs, and mean fALFF values were extracted from these ROIs. We performed a post hoc analysis between each group. To test the clinical significance, We then correlated mean fALFF values from ROIs with neuropsychological scales and CSF biomarkers. Post hoc tests and correlation analyses were corrected for multiple comparisons by Bonferroni correction (p < 0.05/6 and p < 0.05/5 respectively).\nFurther, to explore the differences in fALFF between the HC and other groups, we performed a second-level random-effect two-sample t-test (controlling mean age, education, gender, and FD) on the individual normalized fALFF maps in a voxel-wise manner.\nThe Gaussian random field (GRF) correction was used to correct for multiple comparisons. The statistical threshold was set at p < 0.01 with a cluster-level p < 0.05 (twotailed) in DPABI 4 . GRF-based methods could control the family-wise error rate (FWER) of testing multiple hypotheses by assessing whether the test statistic or the spatial extent of clusters exceeding a cluster-defining threshold is large by chance (Bansal and Peterson, 2018; Yang et al., 2019) . Notably, GRF correction considers spatial smoothness. Thus it could improve the sensitivity of detecting large activation clusters (Friston et al., 1994; Worsley et al., 1996) .\nConsidering all HC were female, we also performed a supplementary analysis only with the females of each group. Table 1 summarized the details of demographics, CSF biomarker levels (A\u03b2 42 , p-tau and t-tau), and corresponding neuropsychological tests. Three groups (preclinical AD, prodromal AD, d-AD) did not differ from HC concerning age and education (age: over-all ANOVA across the four groups; F = 2.181, P = 0.098; comparison of each group vs. HC using t-tests: preclinical AD vs. HC: P > 0.779; prodromal AD vs. HC: P > 0.108; d-AD vs. HC: P > 0.952; education: over-all ANOVA across the four groups; F = 0.698; P = 0.556; comparison of three groups vs. HC using t-tests: preclinical AD vs. HC: P > 0.954; prodromal AD vs. HC: P > 0.495; d-AD vs. HC: P > 0.684). However, there was difference on the distribution of gender between three groups and the HC (overall Fisher's exact test: P = 0.002; Fisher's exact test of comparisons between three groups and HC: preclinical AD vs. HC: P = 0.012; prodromal AD vs. HC: P = 0.001; d-AD vs. HC: P = 0.001)."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Demographic and Clinical Characteristics", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "fALFF Analyses", "text": "Tables 2, 3 summarized the details of the brain regions with a difference in spontaneous activity. The ANCOVA revealed a significant difference in the bilateral posterior cingulate cortex/Precuneus (PCC/PCu) among four groups adjusted with mean age, gender, education and mean FD (P < 0.01, cluster level < 0.05, GRF correction; Figure 1 ). Post hoc analyses only found significant differences of fALFF value in PCC/PCu between HC and the rest of the three groups at the level of p < 0.05/6 after Bonferroni correction. There was no significant difference between other groups (Supplementary Table S1, Supplementary Figure S1 ).\nAlso, we evaluated the fALFF difference between HC and other groups. We found that the preclinical AD group has increased fALFF values in the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) than HC (Figure 2) . The prodromal AD patients showed reduced fALFF in the bilateral PCu, right middle frontal gyrus (MFG), right precentral gyrus and postcentral gyrus (Figure 3) . Within the d-AD group, regions with decreased fALFF mainly included bilateral PCu, left PCC, left cuneus, and superior occipital gyrus, whereas right fusiform gyrus, right PHG, right hippocampus (HP) and inferior temporal gyrus had increased fALFF values (Figure 4) .

We found significant differences of fALFF in bilateral PCC/PCu among HC, preclinical AD, prodromal AD, and d-AD. Compared to HC, the rest of the three groups showed significant fALFF differences in several regions, including the IFG, the PCC/PCu, the PHG/HP, cuneus, MFG, superior occipital gyrus, and fusiform gyrus. Most regions have been reported in previous AD or MCI studies. We considered that the regions found in our study were more associated with pathology because of following two points: on the one hand, we only included subjects under the impact of AD pathology based on the CSF biomarkers; on the other hand, only the subjects with normal cognition and biomarkers would be selected as controls. Thus, these could reduce the influences of non-Alzheimer's pathologic change. Regarding brain activity patterns, three aspects of the results merit particular attention. First, we found significant differences of fALFF in PCC/PCu among four groups, which were related to neuropsychological tests and CSF biomarkers. Also, both the prodromal AD and the d-AD group showed reduced fALFF than HC in these regions. Consistently, previous studies reported that PCC/PCu had structural or functional abnormalities in patients with AD and MCI, such as cortical thinning (Lerch et al., 2005; Singh et al., 2006; He et al., 2008; Dickerson et al., 2009 ) and metabolic disruptions (de Leon et al., 2001; Volkow et al., 2002; Yokoi et al., 2018) . Both the PCC and PCu are essential components of the default mode network (DMN) and are considered as brain network hub regions which have widespread connections to other areas (Cavanna and Trimble, 2006; Zhang and Li, 2012; Leech and Sharp, 2014; Utevsky et al., 2014) . Pathologically, the PCC/PCu is involved in Braak's stage IV and V, highly relating to the emergence of initial symptoms and full development of AD, respectively. Using PET data, Hoenig et al. (2018) found that tau pathology network (TPN) overlapped with the DMN and the frontal control network, and the peaks of tau within TPNs included the PCu, PCC, and PHG. Tau retention in the PCC/PCu could result in the disruption of brain networks crucial for cognitive function. Thus, clinical symptoms appear first in the prodromal AD stage. Previous studies focusing on the AD spectrum without application of biomarkers have also reported that bilateral PCC showed significant differences in brain activity (Yang et al., , 2019 . Thus, the hypoactivity in PCC/PCu may be a potential imaging biomarker that reflects early cerebral change under AD pathology.\nSecond, within the preclinical AD group, increased fALFF values in the IFG were detected compared to HC. Functionally, the frontal lobe participates in episodic memory (Matthews, 2015) and is associated with maintenance of memory FIGURE 3 | The prodromal AD group showed decreased fALFF in bilateral precuneus, right middle frontal gyrus (MFG), right precentral gyrus, and postcentral gyrus than HC. The statistical threshold was set at p < 0.01 with a cluster-level p < 0.05 (two-tailed, GRF corrected). The left hemisphere of the brain corresponds to the left side of the image. (de Chastelaine et al., 2011; McLaren et al., 2012) . Under the impact of amyloid and tau pathology, we interpreted the hyperactivity in the IFG as compensational effects so that the individuals could maintain normal cognitive performance for a period. Recently, Lin et al. (2017) have found that higher activity and stronger functional connectivity in the IFG and insula may protect memory performance against AD-associated pathology. Moreover, the higher BOLD signal in the IFG during the encoding process also has been found in participants classified into a successful group according to performance in the memory task (Pudas et al., 2013) . Our finding supported further that the frontal lobe might be one of the key regions to keep cognitive function in individuals with existed AD pathology. Third, the d-AD group showed increased fALFF than HC in the right PHG/HP, right fusiform gyrus and inferior temporal gyrus. Neuronal hyperactivity has been an increasingly observed phenomenon in the AD pathological cascade (Palop et al., 2007; Bero et al., 2011; Busche and Konnerth, 2015; Palop and Mucke, 2016) . Some animal studies have found hyperactive neurons in the HP and hyperactivity might be linked to dysfunction of the HP (Abramowski et al., 2008; Palop and Mucke, 2010; DeVos et al., 2013; Kr\u00fcger and Mandelkow, 2016; Wu et al., 2016) . Furthermore, hippocampal hyperactivity is related to amyloid deposition and pathologic tau accumulation in these animal models (Abramowski et al., 2008; Palop and Mucke, 2010; DeVos et al., 2013; Kr\u00fcger and Mandelkow, 2016; Wu et al., 2016) . Human neuroimaging studies have linked hippocampal hyperactivity to amyloid accumulation (Huijbers et al., 2015) , apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4; Bookheimer et al., 2000; Johnson et al., 2006; Filippini et al., 2011; Tran et al., 2017) and progression to dementia (Huijbers et al., 2015) . The increased hippocampal activity might be a pathological response, or compensation, or both. However, in the present study, d-AD was suggested as a late stage in Alzheimer's continuum, which has severe cognitive symptoms. Thus, we interpreted that the increased activity in this stage might reflect a pathological response that results in cognitive deficits.\nAlso, there were some limitations. First, our sample size was relatively small, and all HC were female. Few subjects have both the rsfMRI and CSF biomarkers, although the ADNI datasets have a large sample size in AD patients, MCI patients and people with normal cognition. Despite the small sample size, our preliminary study would be helpful for a better understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms in individuals with existed AD pathology but with different cognitive functions. It may provide a new insight for potential AD-related brain activity change. Another limitation is the lack of PET data. According to the research framework, both CSF A\u03b2 42 and amyloid PET are suggested as A biomarker, whereas CSF p-tau and tau PET as T biomarkers (Jack et al., 2018) . In this study, CSF biomarkers were used to confirm individuals' biomarker profile because of a smaller number of tau PET. It is widely-accepted that CSF A\u03b2 42 and p-tau level could reflect the pathologic state associated with amyloid plaque formation and paired helical filament (PHF) tau formation. CSF biomarkers are not the measures of amyloid plaque load and pathologic tau deposits as PET is (Jack et al., 2018) . Further large sample studies combining PET and MRI data would be beneficial for finding more precise mechanisms underlying cognitive symptoms."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "We found different patterns of brain activity in different cognitive stages among the subjects defined as AD biologically.
