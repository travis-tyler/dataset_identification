[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "The high prevalence of functional disability in older persons, with its attendant increased use of healthcare services and need for formal and informal care, 1,2 is one of the most pressing public health problems facing our healthcare system. Currently, there are over 7 million chronically disabled older Americans. 3 The additional cost of medical and long-term care for newly disabled older Americans is estimated to be $26 billion per year. 4 Furthermore, older persons repeatedly identify maintenance of functional independence as a critical determinant of quality of life. 5,6 Although many studies 7 have examined risk factors for functional disability among community-living older persons, the relative importance of a broad range of geriatric impairments (including those in muscle strength, physical capacity, cognition, vision, hearing and psychological status) and chronic diseases has not been well-defined. While recognized by geriatricians for their prognostic importance, 7 geriatric impairments fall outside the traditional disease-oriented model 8 of clinical medicine and thus may be overlooked in the care of older persons in non-geriatric settings, particularly when they are subtle. [9][10][11] With the aging of the population, the diminishing pool of geriatricians, and the prevailing disease-oriented model in most clinical settings, the relevance of geriatric impairments needs to be clearly defined in order to improve the care of older persons. The overall objective of this study was to determine the relative prognostic importance of geriatric impairments and chronic diseases in determining functional disability in a large cohort of community-living older persons who were followed for seven years."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study Participants", "text": "The Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) is an ongoing community-based, observational cohort study. The original objective of CHS was to identify factors associated with the onset of coronary heart disease and stroke in older persons. Beginning in 1989, 5201 men and women aged 65 years or older were recruited from four communities across the United States (Sacramento County, California; Washington County, Maryland; Forsyth County, North Carolina; and Allegheny County, Pennsylvania), with an additional 687 African Americans recruited beginning in 1992 to enhance minority representation. Potential participants were sampled from Medicare eligibility lists in each area. Those eligible included persons who were non-institutionalized, expected to remain in the area for the next three years, and able to provide informed consent. Potentially eligible persons who were wheelchair-bound or were receiving hospice treatment, radiation therapy or chemotherapy for cancer were excluded. Complete details on the inclusion/exclusion criteria have been previously reported. 12 "}, {"section_title": "Data Collection", "text": "Data were collected every 12 months through in-person interviews and examinations. By the end of the analysis period, over 95% of the nondecedents participated in follow-up. We used the initial 1989 assessment as our baseline, incorporating the African-American cohort beginning in 1992. Seven years of follow-up were included for all participants."}, {"section_title": "Study Variables", "text": "Demographics-Age was considered in 5-year categories. Sex, race (non-white versus white), marital status (married versus not married, the latter category includes widowed), and highest level of education (less than high school versus_at least completion of high school) were also included in the analyses. Body Mass Index-Based on previous work demonstrating associations of low and high body mass index (BMI) with functional disability, 13 we included similar categories for low (<21) and high (>30) BMI. Geriatric Impairments-The status of all geriatric impairments was updated annually, to reflect development of new impairments, or resolution of existing ones. Based on previous studies demonstrating an association with functional disabilty, 14 6 geriatric impairments were defined, including impairments in: muscle strength, physical capacity, cognitive function, vision, hearing, and psychological status. All impairments were classified as present or absent, as follows. Grip strength, a valid indicator of overall muscle strength 15 , was measured in the dominant hand using a hand-held JAMAR dynamometer set at level 2 (Patterson MedicalProducts, Inc., Bolingbrook, Illinois). 16 A total of 3 attempts in maximal effort were performed, andthe average value in kilograms was recorded. Low muscle strength was defined as the lowest quintile for sex and body mass index. 17 Physical capacity was assessed using a measure of gait speed. The time to walk 15 feet (4.57 meters) at usual pace was recorded, and slow gait speed was defined as the lowest quintile for sex and height in meters/second. 18 Cognitive function was measured using the Modified Mini-Mental State Exam (3MS) 19 and the Digital Symbol Substitution Test. 20 The 3MS is an expanded version of the Folstein Mini-Mental State Exam, a widely used screening test for dementia. 21 The 3MS incorporates four additional test items (date and place of birth, word fluency, similarities, and delayed recall of words), and expands the range of scores from 0-30 to 0-100. The Digit Symbol Substitution Test explores attention and psychomotor speed. Given a code table displaying the correspondence between pairs of digits (from 1 to 9) and symbols, participants fill in blank squares with the symbol that is paired to the digit, completing as many as possible in 90 seconds. This brief, but complex, task assesses several cognitive processes, including visual search, visuo-motor coordination, and cognitive flexibility. As in previous CHS work, 22 cognitive impairment was defined as a score less than 80 on the Modified Mini-Mental State Exam or a score less than 19 (which represents 1.5 SD below the mean score for this group) on the Digital Symbol Substitution Test. Visual impairment was defined as being unable to see sufficiently well to drive, watch TV, or recognize someone across a room with or without glasses. Hearing impairment was defined as being unable to hear well enough to use the phone, listen to the radio, or carry on a conversation in a crowded room, with or without a hearing aid. (Both visual and hearing impairments were assessed through participant self-report.)_Depressive symptoms, denoting impairments in psychological status, were classified as present based on a score of at least 8 on the (short form) CES-D. 23,24 Higher scores on the CES-D indicate a higher burden of depressive symptoms. The CES-D is a self-reported measure of depressive symptoms experienced during the previous week. Previous research has shown that the 10-item version of the CES-D retains good predictive accuracy relative to the original 20-item version. 24 Chronic Diseases-As with geriatric impairments, we selected chronic diseases for inclusion in these analyses based on previous studies demonstrating an association with functional disabilty. 14 The specific diseases, which were all assessed according to the standardized CHS protocol, 25 included: peripheral vascular disease, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease (CAD), stroke, heart failure, osteoarthritis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The CHS criteria for peripheral vascular disease was based on participant report of exertional leg pain relieved by rest and or physician diagnosis of peripheral vascular disease. Participants were considered diabetic if they: reported a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus; had fasting serum glucose greater than 126 mg/dl; had a serum glucose of at least 200 mg/dL 2 hours following the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT); or reported use of diabetic medications. CAD and stroke were ascertained at annual clinic visits and interim telephone interviews based on self reports of hospitalizations and other acute events. Discharge summaries, cardiac enzyme levels, and electrocardiograms were reviewed by the CHS Cardiovascular Events Committee to classify all potential cases of CAD and stroke. Potential cases of heart failure were ascertained on the basis of hospitalization for heart failure or self-report of a physician diagnosis of heart failure, as determined during clinic visits and telephone interviews. Osteoarthritis and COPD were assigned based on self-report of a physician diagnosis. The status of all diseases was updated annually, with the exceptions of arthritis (which was not assessed at the third year) and COPD (which was assessed only at baseline). Functional Disability-We evaluated two distinct, albeit complementary functional outcomes: onset of activities of daily living (ADL) disability and onset of mobility disability. Both outcomes were assessed annually during in-person interviews. When questioned about ADLs, participants were asked to rate the degree of difficulty they had with each item as \"none\", \"some\", \"a lot\", or \"unable to do.\" To enhance clinical relevance, ADL disability was defined as \"a lot of difficulty\" or being \"unable to do\" at least one of the basic ADLs (bathing, dressing, walking around the home, getting out of bed or a chair, eating, and using the toilet). This designation is based on previous work examining disability outcomes. 26 Mobility disability was similarly defined as \"a lot of difficulty\" or \"unable to do\" either climbing 10 stairs or walking \u00bd mile. For this analysis of incident disability, we considered only participants free of disability at baseline in ADL or mobility, respectively."}, {"section_title": "Statistical Analysis", "text": "For descriptive purposes, we compared demographic and clinical characteristics between participants with 0, 1, 2, and at least 3 geriatric impairments using the Mantel-Haenszel Chi-Square test. We used multivariable Cox hazards regression modeling to analyze the association between individual time-dependent predictor variables and time to onset of ADL/mobility disability. To assess model discrimination, c-statistics (and corresponding confidence intervals [CI]) were calculated, using methods developed for Cox models with time dependent covariates. 27 With the exception of demographic variables (sex, race, marital status, and highest level of education), all other variables were updated throughout the study period to reflect changes in status. Participants were censored at the time of onset of disability, loss to follow-up, or death. To assess associations with disability according to the number of impairments and diseases, respectively, we again used multivariable Cox hazards regression modeling, with 0, 1, 2, and at least 3 impairments or diseases as the time-dependent predictor variables of interest. All (time-varying) covariates shown in Table 2 were included in a single model of ADL disability and in a single model of mobility disability, respectively. These include age, sex, race, marital status, education, BMI, (number of) chronic diseases and (number of) geriatric impairments. Rates of missing baseline data were generally low. The highest missing rate for any single variable was 6.9% for muscle strength, with all other variables missing <5%. However, rates of missing data increased after baseline. By the final year of follow-up, the highest rates of missing data were seen for: grip strength (missing in 15.0%), cognition (missing in 14.6%), and physical capacity (missing in 13.8%). To explore the issue of bias due to missing data, we determined (using the entire data set without stratification) the ignorability of missing data using both Little's 28 and Troxel's 29,30 tests. The data failed to reject the missing at random criteria. 31 Therefore we applied sequential longitudinal imputation methods for missing data over the follow-up period. Missing data were not imputed after death or terminal loss to follow-up. Every statistical analysis in this study was repeated using 10 imputed data sets. The final analytic result from 10 repeated runs was summarized using the SAS 9.2 procedure PROC MIANALYZE. 32 All analyses were conducted using SAS software version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina).

Of the 5,888 participants, 44.8% had no geriatric impairments, 31.2% had 1, 15.2% had 2, and 8.8% had at least three. The prevalence of the geriatric impairments increased with advancing age: while 55.7% of participants aged 65-69 years had no impairments at baseline, only 20% of those aged 80 years or older had none; and while only 3.3% of those in the youngest age group had 3 or more impairments, a quarter of the oldest age group had at least 3. African-American race, \"unmarried\" marital status, and less than high school education were all associated with a larger number of impairments. Among the chronic diseases, participants with a history of stroke and heart failure were most likely to have at least 3 impairments. At baseline, impairments in physical capacity (22.1%), muscle strength (20.0%), and psychological status (21.5%) were most common, followed by impairments in cognition (13.2%), hearing (7.9%) and vision (7.1%). As shown in Figure 1, the baseline prevalence of each impairment increased with advancing age, although the sharpest increases were observed for impairments in cognition, muscle strength, and physical capacity. The prevalence of impairments and diseases increased over the follow-up period, as incident conditions developed. By the final year, 31.8% of participants had impaired psychological status, 22.4% had cognitive impairment, and 10.7% had hearing impairment. Considering the chronic diseases, 26.0% of participants had coronary artery disease by the final year, 8.2% had cerebrovascular disease, and 10.7% had heart failure. Of the 5646 participants who were free of disability in all of the ADLs at baseline, 869 (15%) developed ADL disability over a median follow-up of 6 years. Of the 5174 participants who were free of disability in mobility at baseline, 1577 (30%) developed mobility disability over a median follow-up of 5 years. Table 2 are the multivariable associations of the time-dependent predictor variables with disability in ADLs and mobility, respectively. The strongest, multivariable associations with onset of ADL disability were seen with impairment in physical capacity (hazard ratio [HR] 3.03, P <0.001), arthritis (HR 1.75, P < 0.001), psychological status (HR 1.71, P<0.001), stroke (HR 1.69, HR <0.001), and cognitive impairment (HR 1.62, P<0.001). The strongest associations with onset of mobility disability were seen with impairment in physical capacity (HR 2.24, P<0.001), peripheral vascular disease (HR 1.77, P< 0.001), arthritis (HR 1.71, P<0.001), stroke (HR 1.70, P< 0.001), and BMI>30 (HR 1.59, P<0.001)."}, {"section_title": "Shown in", "text": "To assess the effect of adding geriatric impairments to the full multivariable models (containing all covariates shown in Table 2, i.e., age, sex, race, marital status, education, BMI, and chronic diseases), we calculated c-statistics before and after adding all six geriatric impairments to the models. For the model of ADL disability, the c-statistic before adding the geriatric impairments was 0.726 (95% CI 0.709 -0.742). The c-statistic after all six geriatric impairments were added increased to 0.771 (95% CI 0.755-0.787). This improvement in cstatistic was statistically significant, P < 0.001. For the model of mobility disability, the cstatistic before adding the geriatric impairments was 0.691 (95% CI 0.678 -0.703). The cstatistic after all six geriatric impairments were added increased to 0.716 (95% CI 0.703-0.729). This improvement in c-statistic was statistically significant, P < 0.05. Table 3 shows the adjusted associations of the number of impairments and diseases with the onset of disability in ADLs and mobility, respectively. The geriatric impairments were generally more strongly associated with ADL disability than the chronic diseases, with differences in strength of association increasing as the number of impairments/diseases increased. For mobility, the number of impairments was nearly as strongly associated with disability as the number of chronic diseases. Among those without mobility disability at baseline, 8.5% died without ever having documented mobility disability. Among those without ADL disability at baseline, 12.1% died without ever having documented ADL disability. Because death and disability are competing outcomes, we reran our analyses using a combined outcome of disability or death, and the results were similar to those seen with disability alone (available upon request)."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "Our results demonstrate that when compared with chronic diseases, geriatric impairments are more strongly associated with the onset of disability in ADLs, and nearly as strongly associated with the onset of disability in mobility. Among the impairments, those in physical capacity, psychological status, and cognition had the strongest associations with onset of disability in ADLs and mobility. These impairments are amenable to interventions, including exercise training, psycho-behavioral programs, and caregiver services, suggesting that they can serve as therapeutic targets to reduce the burden of disability in older persons. Strategies to prevent the onset of disability should be a priority. For all too many older persons, the onset of functional disability is the harbinger of a downward spiral: one marked by increasing frailty, dependence on caregivers, hospitalization, and possibly nursing home placement. The economic toll on our health care system is staggering, and patients and their families are left with greatly diminished quality of life. While several previous studies 7 have examined the prognostic importance of geriatric impairments and chronic diseases on an array of functional outcomes, few [33][34][35] have directly compared their respective magnitude of associations. Our study has several unique strengths. We included seven years of annual follow-up on over 5000 older persons, allowing us to account for the development of new impairments and diseases. Prior work has had more limited follow-up, 33,34 smaller cohorts, 35 and did not account for diseases and impairments that develop after the initial assessment. 34 Detailed medical record review supplemented self-reported information for several chronic diseases, enhancing the validity of our data. Previous studies have relied on self-report only. 33,34 Attrition for reasons other than death was small, further strengthening the validity and generalizability of our results. Geriatric impairments were assessed using well-recognized, contemporary measures. The functional outcomes selected (i.e. ADLs and mobility) represent every day tasks that are important for independent community living, and are among the most widely used measures of functional abilities. We used sophisticated multiple imputation methods to address missing data, an important issue in longitudinal studies of older persons. Missing data can bias results, reduce power, and affect generalizability. Notably, intercurrent health events, cognitive impairment, and functional decline can all result in incomplete longitudinal data. 36,37 The generalizability of our results is enhanced by the fact that the CHS data were collected from a representative sample of community-living older persons from across the U.S., with a large proportion of African-Americans. Our findings are also distinct from those derived from other large aging cohorts, including Health ABC, 26,38,39 the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, 40,41 InCHIANTI, [42][43][44] Rotterdam, 45 as well as work by other prominent aging investigators, [46][47][48][49][50][51] , which have examined the prognostic importance of individual geriatric impairments as risk factors for functional disability, but have not compared the relative importance of a broad range of geriatric impairments and chronic diseases. Our inclusion of gait speed as one of the geriatric impairments may raise concern about \"auto-correlation\", i.e., that measures of physical capacity should predict disability better than chronic diseases because they are measuring the same thing. However, it is important to note physical capacity (gait speed) was more strongly associated with onset of disability in activities of daily living (ADLs) than with mobility disability, as shown in Table 2. When examining the prognostic importance all geriatric impairments together (as shown in Table  3), we also see that the impairments were more strongly associated with onset of disability in ADL than mobility. If the observed associations were driven by autocorrelation, we would expect stronger associations between geriatric impairments and mobility than with ADLs, which include eating, bathing, dressing, walking around the home, getting out of bed or a chair, and using the toilet. Furthermore, we included several geriatric impairments distinct from physical capacity, including impairments in cognition, vision, hearing, and psychological status which (as shown in Table 2) were independently associated with onset of disability in mobility and ADLs. This study also has several limitations, which should be considered when interpreting our results. The CHS data included in this study were collected beginning in 1989 through 1996. Clinical practice has certainly changed since this time and it is possible that the relationship between geriatric impairments and functional disability has changed. However, given the dominance of the disease-oriented model and relative invisibility of geriatric impairments within this model, it is unlikely that the relationship between impairments and outcomes has changed substantially. In addition, because CHS excluded institutionalized persons, this cohort is not representative of all elderly patients. 12 However, exclusion of institutionalized elderly persons is consistent with our focus on examining the onset of functional disability among those with intact function at baseline. Although we have contrasted geriatric impairments and chronic diseases, some impairments may in fact be due to diseases (e.g., vision impairments due to diabetes mellitus). The relationships between impairments and diseases are often complex, but given the prevailing disease-oriented model, it is still useful to consider impairments and diseases separately for our purposes. The observational nature of this study limits the ability to draw a causal connection between the presence of geriatric impairments and functional disability. While treatment rates of impairments and diseases, secondary complications, application of tertiary prevention, and effects of hospitalizations are all important issues to consider, they are outside the scope of the available data. Medicine has been slow to develop strategies to provide optimal care for older patients, despite the aging of the population. Although chronic diseases have been the focus of attention in the traditional disease-oriented model of care, our work demonstrates that geriatric impairments are stronger determinants of disability in ADLs, and nearly as strong for mobility disability. Previous work has called for the abandonment of disease as the primary focus of medical care, with greater attention to geriatric impairments and functional abilities. 8 Defenders of the status quo argue that \"this is nothing new, we already do this.\" 52 While some clinicians may practice in this fashion, the organization, quality assessment, and reimbursement of medical care remain firmly rooted in the disease-specific model of care, making systematic, widespread diffusion of geriatric assessments into everyday clinical practice outside of geriatric settings nearly impossible. Our results, which are consistent with prominent models of functional disability 53 , should be used to help guide the development of more patient-centered care for older patients, based on the routine assessment and management of geriatric impairments to prevent functional disability. Most older persons live in the community and are not under the primary care of geriatricians. There is a need for increased focus on geriatric impairments in diverse health care settings. With the rapid aging of our population, health care must evolve to better meet the needs of older persons.
