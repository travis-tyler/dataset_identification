In contrast, it is generally more difficult to obtain the input and output of high-volume weather and climate models and reanalysis products and data files that are useful in numerous applications (e.g., model improvement, intercomparison, validation and verification, extremes, climatology indices, and observational density spacing and process studies). Although various historical access solutions (Rutledge et al. 1998 ) exist at various government laboratories and other institutions, a U.S. national archive of operational weather and climate models has simply not existed. To address the need for access to such model data, the NCDC, National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP), and Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) have initiated the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Operational Model Archive and Distribution System (NOMADS). The primary goals of NOMADS are to act as a distributed front-end service to NCEP, and to improve access to a suite of popular model datasets and observations, ranging from numerical weather prediction (NWP) fields to Coupled Global Climate Model (CGCM) output to global and regional reanalysis. This paper describes the products currently available in NOMADS, its distributed and interoperable format-neutral approach to data management, and the NOMADS access tools that are currently available.\nNOMADS servers exist at several locations in the United States, including the real-time (R/T) server at NCEP (i.e., the R/T NOMADS), the GFDL Data Portal providing NOMADS-compatible services for CGCM output and other data, and the real-time and historical NOMADS service at NCDC, which is the focus of this article."}, {"section_title": "THE NOMADS ARCHITECTURE.", "text": "A new paradigm for sharing data among climate and weather modelers is evolving. It takes advantage of the Internet and relatively inexpensive computer hardware. In this new framework, scientists put their data onto a computer on the Internet. Software running on the computer allows outside users to see not only their local data but also data on other computers running the same software and data format descriptions. NOMADS participants serve their datasets through a client-server relationship, that is, the datasets are Internet-ready and the display is done by the user (their client). The NOMADS approach to data distribution is applicable to a large set of data products, including both observational and numerical model-based files, and can serve users interested in time scales ranging from those associated with synoptic weather features to those related to decadalto-centennial climate issues.\nThe operational NOMADS server at NCDC has three independent ingests of model data. Data feeds are compared against each other and repopulated if necessary on a daily basis before reaching the NCDC archive. This increases the possibility for a serially complete archive. Data quality control processes include checks on the raw Gridded Binary (GRIB; WMO 2001a) model data and its associated transmission and file headers to the actual product, thus ensuring the highest possible quality data are being archived and made available for distribution via NOMADS. NCDC works closely with NCEP if header or data errors are detected. Ingested models are also aggregated by model, grid, and forecast projection, which, along with locally generated \"index\" files (a file and variable identifier utility), greatly increases the access speed of requested files or subsets. NOMADS ingests approximately 250,000 individual grids a day, and with these index and filelevel optimizations users can gain online access to any single model variable within seconds. The NCDC NOMADS security and access control is achieved through read-only Network File System (NFS) mounting of the NOMADS publicly accessible servers within NCDC's firewall to the online Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID) data servers behind the NCDC firewall. The online data currently account for approximately 20 terabytes (TB) of data with a doubling of this capability in the very near term. Offline access to NCDC's mainframe archive is by request only and at the user's request is staged to NOMADS data servers where users can then access the information using NOMADS-distributed technologies. Additional operational NCDC ingest, archive, and quality control process are also performed, including system loading, back-end disk clustering, load balancing, and other backup capabilities to form a 24/7 operation."}, {"section_title": "ACCESS TOOLS.", "text": "From the early stages of its initial development the NOMADS team (Rutledge 2001) sought to leverage off existing data access approaches and to advance the concept of distributed format- neutral data access. In other words, the approach involved drawing upon existing agency and institutional solutions while developing partnerships and promoting the Open Source Project for a Network Data Access Protocol (OPeNDAP) transport protocol [formally called Data Object Design Studio (DODS); Gallagher and Milkowski 1995; Davis and Gallagher 1999] . As a result, NOMADS and other institutions provide access to distributed format-neutral data in several ways and not necessarily under the NOMADS collaboration. There are several user options for accessing NOMADS datasets, available for both advanced and novice users. A NOMADS Users' Guide is available to assist users in accessing NOMADS datasets (available online at http://nomads.ncdc.noaa. gov/guide/). The following access tools form the core of services while using NOMADS:\n\u2022 The OPeNDAP Hyper-text Transfer Protocol (http) data transport protocol and the associated OPeNDAP Data Connector (ODC) program allows users to search for and retrieve datasets published by OPeNDAP data servers. OPeNDAP servers are located at major institutions around the world and serve a wide variety of data, including weather and climate, satellite imagery, ocean, and other datasets.\nThe ODC (Fig. 1 ) is downloaded to a users' desktop and provides a search-and-download capability to import the data into client applications like Grid Analysis and Display System (GrADS), Climate Data Analysis Tools (CDAT), Interactive Data Language (IDL) Ferret, Matlab, SPSS, Excel, and ArcView, or into databases such as Access and Oracle, and plot them with advanced graphics capabilities (many of these desktop tools are more fully described below). OPeNDAP and OPeDNAPenabled clients are the core technologies to enable format-neutral access across disparate systems and data formats. More information on OPeNDAP and the ODC can be found at the OPeNDAP home page (online at http://opendap.org/).\n\u2022 The NCDC NOMADS has interactive Web browse, plot, and access tools (see the NOMADS Web pages at http://nomads.ncdc.noaa.gov):\n1) \"PLOT\": The NCDC NOMADS \"Web Plotter\" originally developed by NCEP provides browse, limited online calculations, on-and offline access to data and variable subsets, long time series, Hovmoeller diagrams, and advanced plot and animation capabilities. \"Plot\" includes the GrADS display client (Fig. 2) 2) \"FTP4U\": The ftp4u capability (Ebisuzaki et al. 2004) provides access to binary GRIB data by subsetting through time, space, and variables using traditional but enhanced file transfer protocol (ftp) processes. Data are provided in raw GRIB format either online or from NCDC's offline archive. If the data are offline, the user fills out a Web request to move the data from the NCDC archive to the NOMADS online disks. This process can take up to several hours depending on the size of the request, at which time an e-mail notification procedure informs the user to return to NOMADS and access the requested data that are now online (Fig. 3 ). 3) \"HTTP\" AND \"WGET\" AND OPENDAP CONSTRAINT EXPRESSIONS: The http link provides simple filelevel access to download entire directories or files. This access method provides users with a wellknown process to collect multiyear requests. The \"wget\" utility is a freely available network utility to retrieve files from the World Wide Web, using http and ftp, which are the two most widely used Internet protocols. Because wget is a noninteractive downloading utility, one can execute scripts containing wget commands. While http access is familiar to many users, it is highly recommended that users learn to subset their requests either by variable or time period for high-volume requests.\n\u2022 Another very powerful tool for accessing highvolume NOMADS data is using the combination of http and an OPeDNAP \"constraint\" expression. \u2022 The GrADS Data Server (GDS; Adams et al. 2004) combines both the GrADS (Doty et al. 2001) desktop analysis tool [a freeware client from the Center for Ocean-Land-Atmosphere Studies (COLA)] and the OPeNDAP server to subset and exchange data in many formats with http. GDS data are fully OPeNDAP described to present the raw GRIB and Binary Universal Form for the Representation of Meteorological Data (BUFR; WMO 2001b) as OPeNDAP-compliant Network CDF (NetCDF) files. Users execute an open URL to data rather than keep the data locally. The NCDC and NCEP NOMADS systems use GDS as its primary indexing, inventory, and host-side data manipulation and subsetting tool for users (an example GrADS display is shown as part of the \"plot\" function in Fig. 2 ).\n\u2022 The CDAT is an open-source Python-based environment for scientific calculations and graphics with a focus on the needs of climate modelers. CDAT is primarily developed at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to provide flexible access to georeferenced scientific data. It can present distributed datasets as a unified virtual database through the use of OPeNDAP networking. NWP GR IB and BUFR data are accessed by LAS though the GDS OPeNDAP capability. Ferret (Hankin et al. 1996) is the default desktop visualization application used by LAS, though other applications can also be used.\n\u2022 The Interactive Data Viewer (IDV) from Unidata is a Javabased software framework for analyzing and visualizing geoscience data in two, three, and four (time) dimensions. The IDV brings together the ability to display and work with satellite imagery, gridded data, surface observations, balloon soundings, National Weather S e r v ic e ( N WS) We at he r Su r vei l la nce R ad a r-1988 Doppler (WSR-88D) Level II and Level III radar data, and NOAA National Profiler Network data, all within a unified interface (Fig. 6 ). This desktop client can be downloaded from http://my.unidata.ucar. edu/content/software/IDV/ index.html.\nThe significant advantage that these OPeNDAP-enabled clients and servers have over traditional servers is that they provide direct access to data across multiple servers in the OPeNDAP format-neutral (NetCDF) form. For example, data served by the GDS meet OPeNDAP standards so that the raw GRIB data are seen by clients as a standard NetCDF file. Users execute an open URL to data rather then opening a local file on their disk. For high-volume data requests, data can be requested by variable, temporal, and spatial extents to reduce the overall volume of the request. Further, on many OPeNDAP-enabled servers, and the GDS in particular, users can request server-side computations on these data and even cache the results of a previously calculated value in a temporary directory for use at a later date. To use the NCDC NOMADS GDS, navigate to the data of interest under the \"gds\" Web heading using a common Web browser. Following the directory structure based on model and date, locate the OPeNDAP metadata under the \"info\" section of the OPeNDAP files. Then, copy the \"DODS url\" (Fig. 7) found there into your client as an appropriate open statement (e.g., in GrADS: \"sdfopen\"). The client now has all of the necessary information on that data file as to where it is, and how to decode, plot, and retrieve individual data elements contained within that file. Once this information is known, users can then develop scripts to automate the \"distributed\" access of the desired model data by date, time, model run, or variable.\nNOMADS also provides a catalog-level discovery and access component using Unidata's Thematic Real-time Environmental Data Distributed Services (THREDDS) Catalog Service (TCS) system , and therefore includes easy access for their OPeNDAP-enabled IDV desktop client. The THREDDS Data Server (TDS), by Unidata, combines a TCS with integrated data-serving capabilities, including OPeNDAP and Web Coverage Services (WCS), with automatic catalog generation. The data format capabilities of the TDS include NetCDF-3, OPeNDAP 2, and Hierarchical Data Format (HDF)5 data models, into what is called the \"Common Data Model.\" NCDC NOMADS has implemented and is testing the latest release of the TDS and expect it to become part of the operational NOMADS for search, use, and access services in the near future. Another catalog service being prototyped at the NCEP R/T component of NOMADS is the Distributed Metadata Server (DIMES) server for search, discovery, and access (Yang et al. 2001) .\nOther search and access tools available to the user include metadata entries and direct portal access from the Global Change Master Directory (GCMD), and metadata descriptions as required under the Federal Geospatial Data Committee (FGDC) metadata schema. Formal NCDC archive documentation is also available for NOMADS datasets in text format from NCDC.\nDATA AVAIL ABILIT Y. The NOMADS data management vision is to make model and associated data and information services uniformly available, providing seamless provision of and access to model input and output data, independent of format and how and where they are collected and stored . The NOMADS at NCDC has been distributing products since 2003 and currently has over 16 TB of online data available for direct online access. Today the NCDC NOMADS provides up to approximately 5 TB of model and observational data representing roughly 1 million downloads per month. Both the NCDC and NCEP NOMADS servers provide access to the model output as soon as it is available from the NCEP computers. The R/T NOMADS (Alpert et al. 2002) servers at NCEP provide short-term real-time services while the NCDC NOMADS provides both historical and real-time data. Additionally, a server located at NCDC provides a backup service to the NCEP server in a \"mirror\" configuration. This configuration allows researchers to transparently browse, extract, and intercompare online model data from the R/T NOMADS server at NCEP, and if needed, access historical data from the NCDC server forming a 24/7 operation. For a complete listing of data availability on the NOMADS systems at GFDL, NCDC, and NCEP, see the NCDC NOMADS pages online at http://nomads.ncdc.noaa.gov.

As noted earlier, as an example of an OPeNDAP service, the NOMADS team has developed a client application that accesses the NCEP global ensemble model forecast data to produce user-selected weather element event probabilities. Probability estimates can be defined simply as the percentage of ensemble forecasts of the total number that satisfy a specified event for some weather element. Ensembles are composed of many model realizations and access many large files for small amounts of data at specific locations, and for certain variables can be efficiently accomplished by the NOMADS GDS. In other words, the user does not have to download all of the high-volume files just to access the information contained in the one variable. The event probabilities are easily extended over ensemble model forecast times to show probability histograms defining a product for the forecast probability of user- **The real-time data are available at NCEP and available for up to 2 weeks.

Climate) that have been archived to the NCEP NOMADS public servers in GRIB format. These include forecast monthly means of all 15 members initialized in each calendar month of the year, covering a period of 23 yr from 1981 to 2003. They also include an ensemble mean of the 15 members, and the verifying observations. The forecast lead time is from 0 to 8 months. The data can be found on the NCEP NOMADS server at http://nomad6.ncep.noaa.gov/.\nNCEP NARR. The NCDC NOMADS is NOAA's primary access point for the new NARR. NARR is a reprocessing of the historical meteorological observations using NCEP's regional forecast model and associated 3D variational data assimilation (3DVAR) system. The products of NARR will be a new set of meteorological analyses covering the North American domain with a 32-km horizontal resolution, 3-h temporal resolution, and 50-hPa vertical resolution for October 1978 to the present. A \"merged\" dataset based on the analyses plus fluxes on the AWIPS grid is available on NOMADS at approximately 5-TB (60 MB every 3 h) volume. The NARR Monthly Means (NARRMON) dataset contains a monthly average (computed at NCEP) of all the fields in NARR. The NARRMON 3-h dataset is a monthly average of all fields, separated into eight 3-h time periods for each day throughout a month. See Table 1 for more information.\nOf note for NARR users: the data for each analysis time is split into two files so that the data will be compatible with the software program GrADS. For example, the \"narr-b\" file contains a 3-h forecast of the sensible heat flux whereas the \"narr-a\" file contains the average from the 0-3-h forecast. For example, suppose we set GrADS to have only one time variable to read analysis and forecast files:\n\u2022 file A: analysis at 0000 UTC 1 January 2004, \u2022 file B: 3-h forecast valid at 0000 UTC 1 January"}, {"section_title": "2004.", "text": "GrADS allows you to combine datasets together so one can make a time series. If NOMADS combined all of the \"A\" files together, GrADS users would set the time to 1800 UTC 1 January 2004 and make a successful plot. On the other hand, if the A and B files were combined together, the GrADS client would not be able to distinguish between the analyses or the forecast valid time. To avoid this GrADS limitation, all of the data were put into the A files, except for the forecasts that would cause the timing confusion. Most users will only require the A files, while those users requiring a hydrological analyses increment, for example, will require the B files.\nGFDL CGCM. The GFDL's CGCMs are available under the NOMADS framework, including model output and documentation of experiments performed using GFDL's current generation of global coupled climate models named GFDL CM2.0 and GFDL CM2.1. These two models are being applied to decadal-to-centennial (deccen) time-scale climate issues, including multicentury control experiments and climate change projections. To learn more about the GFDL CM2.0 and CM2.1 models and their output, one may visit http://nomads.gfdl.noaa. gov/CM2.X.\nThe GFDL CM2.0 and CM2.1 medium-resolution climate models consist of atmosphere, ocean, sea ice, and land surface model components coupled together. The two CM2.x models differ in some of their dynamics and physical parameterizations. While the atmosphere and land surface components use a different grid than do the ocean and sea ice components, both CM2.0 and CM2.1 share the same grid resolutions. The archived atmosphere and land surface model output is on a grid with approximately 2\u00b0 grid spacing in the horizontal. While the atmospheric GCM utilizes 24 atmospheric levels, the vast majority of the atmospheric model output is stored on 17 standard pressure levels. The ocean and sea ice model grid resolution is approximately 1\u00b0 in the horizontal with higher resolution in the Tropics, and \"tripolar\" elements in the Arctic. The ocean model component has 50 vertical levels.\nModel output from 20 experiments (10 each for CM2.0 and CM2.1) are accessible from the GFDL Data Portal (see online at http://nomads. gfdl.noaa.gov/). These experiments were driven by forcing agents consistent with those requested by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (Houghton et al. 2001 ) for their fourth assessment report (AR4), and are applicable to research projects associated with the U.S. Climate Change Science Program (CCSP). The 10 experiments include the following:\n\u2022 one preindustrial (circa 1860) control (300 yr of output available),\n\u2022 three \"Climate of the 20th Century\" experiments (140 yr each; simulating 1861-2000),\n\u2022 three Special Report on Emissions (SRES) climate change projections (A2, A1B, and B1 scenarios) in which forcing agents vary from 2001 to 2100 (the A1B and B1 experiments continue to year 2300 with forcing agents stabilized at 2100 levels),\n\u2022 one \"committed climate change\" 100-yr-long model simulation, with forcing agents stabilized at year 2000 levels,\n\u2022 two idealized forcing integrations in which atmospheric CO 2 increases 1% yr -1 to twice (the 2X run) and four times (the 4X run) its initial value, and is then held constant for a minimum of 150 additional years (220-300-yr experiment durations).\nSome model output files from GFDL's older R30 and R15 climate model integrations are still available for those interested in previous generations of GFDL coupled climate models. See the GFDL Web site for more information on all these models integrations."}, {"section_title": "OTHER APPLICABLE TECHNOLOGIES AND PROJECTS.", "text": "To respond to these changing requirements and mission goals a flexible user access infrastructure must become increasingly robust, responsive, efficient, secure, adaptable, and cost effective. NOMADS users have the capability to subset high-volume data; however, some researchers and others require access to entire suites of highvolume model data. One such effort that augments NOMADS for access to high-volume model data is the Earth System Grid (ESG) (Foster et al. 2001) . The Department of Energy's (DOE's) Program for Climate Model Diagnostics and Intercomparison (PCMDI), NCAR, and other DOE sites initiated and continue to develop GRID-based intelligent filing systems and data management software to link storage devices located throughout the United States and the international climate research community. ESG uses the Globus Toolkit (Foster et al. 2004 ) grid technology among other services and data location and management techniques developed especially for climate and other high-data-volume users. The latest U.S. climate models from GFDL and NCAR for the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change (IPCC) Model Intercomparison Project (MIP) are being accessed through the ESG at PCMDI. GRID-and Web-based \"services\" have emerged as viable technologies that are increasingly utilized by government laboratories, corporate institutions, and high-performance computing centers around the world. GRID and Web services are being developed and used in diverse applications such as high-energy physics, medical imaging, meteorology, and business applications. Recently completed efforts to define GRID software standards that align with standards from the World Wide Web, and Globus's adherence to these standards, have strengthened the interest and commitment of industry toward GRID computing (M. Govett, M. Doney, and P. Hyder 2004, unpublished manuscript) .\nIt is the opinion of the authors that Web-based services will become an ingrained part of data access and computation in the near future as \"Web services\" using Extensible Markup Language (XML) (Bray et al. 1998 ) will become as transparent as http is today. One such exploratory effort-SciFlow (Yunck et al. 2004 )-is a good example of distributed Web-and GRID-based service. Other data access efforts for high-volume model data access are being provided through Web and GRID-based portals, including the NCAR Community Data Portal (CDP) (online at https://cdp.ucar.edu /); NASA's Earth science community, especially through the Earth Systems Information Partners (ESIP) program; and the Earth System Modeling Framework (ESMF), an outstanding modular model coding project (online at www. esmf.ucar.edu/). Finally, international efforts, especially in Europe (Lawrence et al. 2004) , are advancing interoperable data and system access and computation for both the GRID and Web.\nNOMADS is monitoring the direction that the open-source and Web and GRID services communities are taking and leveraging these new tools as they develop. NOMADS is an active participant in many national and international exploratory and directed efforts, and has been selected as a candidate architecture to promote under the NOAA's Data Management Integration Team (DMIT) Global Earth Observations Integrated Data Environment (GEO-IDE) plan, and cited in plans developed by the Integrated Earth Observation System Architecture and Data Management Working Group (ADM), of the U.S. Group on Earth Observations (US-GEO). NOMADS is also involved in the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS, online at www.ceos.org) CEOS GRID project; the Linked Environments for Atmospheric Discovery (LEAD) project (Droegemeier et al. 2004) ; and members and contributors to the Global Organization for Earth System Science Portal (GO-ESSP, online at http://essp.gfdl.noaa.gov). GO-ESSP is an international grassroots effort that emerged from the original NOMADS collaborator's to address distributed data access to models and associated data, and actively works to resolve modelers' needs for interdisciplinary research and access. More information on GO-ESSP can be found online at http://go-essp.gfdl.noaa.gov/.

For the first time NOMADS users can access a historical longterm suite of model input, output, and observations to analyze and improve climate change and detection processes, to improve short-term NWP and seasonal forecasts, and to improve long-term global climate simulations under a distributed client-server framework. The goals of NOMADS are to\n\u2022 improve access to NWP and GCM models and provide the observational and data assimilation products for regional model initialization and forecast verification,\n\u2022 improve operational weather forecasts, \u2022 develop linkages between the research and operational modeling communities and foster collaborations between the climate and weather modeling communities,\n\u2022 promote product development and collaborations within the geoscience communities (ocean, weather, and climate) to study multiple earth systems using collections of distributed data under a sustainable system architecture, and\n\u2022 act as a resource for the development of a long-term framework for systematic approaches to climate change detection efforts, climate and weather model evaluation, impacts studies, and other process studies.\nTo achieve this, NOMADS uses the OPeNDAP protocol and common data schema conventions, and suggests that new participants use and advance this service methodology and that data generators' and scientists work to provide their data in one of the many applicable data schema and formats.\nThe NOMADS has been developed to address model data access needs as outlined in the U.S. Weather Research Program (USWRP) \"Implementation Plan for Research in Quantitative Precipitation Forecasting and Data Assimilation,\" which states a need to \"redeem practical value of research findings and facilitate their transfer into operations.\" The NOMADS framework was also developed to facilitate model and observational data intercomparison issues as discussed in documents such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC; Houghton et al. 2001) , and the CCSP (online at www.climatescience. gov). Finally, NOMADS directly addresses goals as outlined in the National Research Council (NRC 2003) report \"Fairweather: Effective partnerships in weather and climate services\" recommendation number five that states\nThe NWS should make its data and products available in Internet-accessible digital form. Information held in digital databases should be based on widely recognized standards, formats, and metadata descriptions to ensure that the data from different observing platforms, databases, and models can be integrated and used by all interested parties in the weather and climate enterprise.\nThe NOMADS data management vision is to make model data and information services uniformly available to all elements of NOAA, including the public and the operational and research communities, thus providing seamless provision of an interoperable access to model data independent of format, or how and where they are collected and stored. NOMADS has been developed as a unified climate and weather archive providing Web access to information so that users can make decisions about their specific research, operational, and education needs.

It is hoped that these collaborations will not only promote product development but new collaborations within the geoscience communities (ocean, weather, and climate) to study multiple earth systems using collections of distributed data under an integrated sustainable system architecture."}, {"section_title": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.", "text": "The authors acknowledge and thank the efforts of the many NOMADS partners working at the grassroots level for the advancement of distributed format neutral access to data. Acknowledgments are provided to the OPeDNAP and GO-ESSP efforts referenced earlier in this publication, and to Thomas Karl, NCDC Director, for his early and continuing support for NOMADS. Without these visionaries and the tools to access these data NOMADS would not exist."}]
