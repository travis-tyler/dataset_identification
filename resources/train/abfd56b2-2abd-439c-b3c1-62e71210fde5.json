[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "A major push for tax reform in the United States is currently underway. It would be the first major rewrite of the tax code in several decades and could potentially impact not only domestic residents but the global economy. Federal tax policy has the ability to affect the economic behavior and well-being of farm households, as well as management and profitability of farm businesses. Tax rates and tax preferences for certain activities affect not only after-tax income of farm households but also influence economic decisions. 1 Likewise, farm businesses are impacted by individual tax rates and business tax preferences provided by deductions, credits and other provisions. 2 Together, provisions of the tax code affect the welfare of family-farm households and the bottom lines of their farm operations. This article provides estimates of the direct economic impacts that major tax reform plans would have on farm households and business. The study emphasizes not only the aggregate impacts, but also the heterogeneous effects on farm households in different income groups; and, unlike other studies, in the properties and impacts of the tax regimes over a business cycle. The Great Recession reminded us that business cycles are important features of the economy and therefore it is critical to take them into consideration when analyzing taxes. Figure 1 shows that farm household income moderated between the 2007 and 2010 period, and expansed between 2011 and 2016. The tax reform plans we examine are based on the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) as proposed in the House of Representatives and the Senate. Henceforth we refer to the House version of TCJA as the \"House Bill\" while the Senate version of the TCJA is referred as the \"Senate Bill.\" We find that the TCJA reduces aggregate tax liabilities by at least $65 billion (in 2016 real dollars) on tax receipt from farm households over a ten-year period; however, there is significant heterogeneity in the allocation of the tax saving across different groups. Both tax reform plans decrease the average effective tax rate for farm households by an average of 3 percent over the ten-year period. Farm households with income between the 20th to 80th percentile see a modest reduction in their effective income tax rates, while wealthier households, the top 10 percent and top 1 percent, see the biggest decreases in their rates. Under both reform plans, the lowest quintile of farm households would see an increase in their total tax liability (net of credits and deductions). To obtain our results, we develop an individual tax model (ITM) to estimate tax variables for the farm operation and farm household using a nationally representative sample, and apply the major tax code provision changes to simulate their effects on farm household finances, both under current tax law as in effect in 2016 (\"current law\") and based on proposed changes in the TCJA. The analysis 1 Decisions such as labor force participation and labor allocation (hours worked), personal investment, timing of income realization, housing decisions, and even decisions about family formation (Slemrod, 1995;Heckman, 1993;Eissa and Liebman, 1996;Dickert-Conlin and Chandra, 1999;Saez, 2002;Saez et al., 2012). 2 These tax preferences include special provisions that allow farms to allocate income and net losses across years to help smooth tax liabilities from characteristically volatile farm business earnings; farms employing labor are allowed an extra deduction for wages paid, potentially affecting hiring decisions; and farm capital investment is subject to accelerated cost recovery provisions that effectively lowers the cost of capital (LeBlanc and Hrubovcak, 1986;Ariyaratne et al., 2009;Williamson and Stutzman, 2016). is performed at the household level, and the tax model is used to estimate (i) overall tax liability for farm households' federal income tax, and (ii) distributional effects of current law and the TCJA. We estimate the impact of the TCJA on farm households, because for most farm operations, farm income flows untaxed from the operation to the farm household where it is taxed at the individual level along with the farm household's other income; therefore, the impacts of tax reform are the result of the interrelatedness of individual and business tax reform. 3 Our model is rich in detail and is able to account for key items of the individual income tax, such as the alternative minimum tax, capital gains treatment, itemized deductions, earned income credit, child credits, multiple business deductions and other features of the income tax code. We use repeated cross-sections of farm household-level data from ten years of the USDA's Agricultural Resource Management Survey (2007-2016 to simulate the impacts of tax policy over a decade of actual economic activity, inclusive of external shocks, cyclical entry/exit, and investment decisions. In order to test for the performance of the TCJA across the farm business cycle, we hold the tax law parameters constant across time and adjust nominal variables in the dataset using the Consumer Price Index with 2016 as the base. Thus, our model estimates the effects of tax reform over a decade, but rather than relying on growth projections and other assumptions, we use past data that captures the inherent stochastic nature of business cycle. We believe that this approach gives us an advantage over competing analysis whose conclusions are not robust to changes in the growth projections, let alone switching from growth to contraction. In the next section we discuss the background of the Federal income taxation of farm households and farm operations. In Section III we describe major tax provisions affecting farm operations and the changes as proposed by the TCJA. Section IV briefly describes the data employed in the analysis. Section V presents the results of the tax simulations, and finally Section VI concludes the paper."}, {"section_title": "Taxation and Tax Reform Provisions", "text": "The vast majority of farms are pass-through entities, and as such, income from farming is subject to the federal individual income tax, rather than the corporate income tax. Data collected in the ERS/NASS Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) shows that pass-through entities are the predominant form of legal organization for farms in the United States. Figure 2 shows the types of legal organizations of family farms since 2009. 4 In 2016, farms organized as these types of pass-through constituted over 98 percent of family farms and almost 92 percent of the total value of agricultural production in the United States. Seven and a half percent of these family farms were registered LLCs. 5 Farm households receive income from both farm and off-farm activities, and for most, off-farm income accounts for a large share of the household's total income. In many cases, farms have negative net income (losses) when business expenses including depreciation and deductions for capital investments exceed farm earnings. In this case, farm losses may be used to offset off-farm income. Since 1980, farm sole proprietors as a group have reported negative aggregate net farm income for tax purposes and, over the last decade, both the share of farmers reporting losses and the amount of losses reported have increased. Because taxes on farm income are paid at the individual level, under the TCJA, changes to the individual income tax system, farm households could experience significant changes to their after-tax incomes. Furthermore, any reform of the Federal income tax code could also impact investment, management, and production decisions in the agricultural sector. The remainder of this section discusses some of the most important tax provisions for the farm sector. Readers can skip the remainder of this section and refer to table 1 for an even more succinct summary than the one below. In addition to discussing the proposed changes and contrasting to current regulation, some statistics are provided to illustrate the relative importance of each provision to farm households and businesses."}, {"section_title": "Individual Income Tax Brackets", "text": "The 2017 TCJA would reduce marginal tax rates, and in the House Bill, reduces the number of brackets, from its current seven (see table 1 for a side-by-side comparison of current law and the TCJA). The House and Senate versions of the TCJA each have their own rates and bracket structure; the House version compresses the seven current brackets into four, while the Senate retains the number of brackets as under current law, but significantly increases the income thresholds of most brackets."}, {"section_title": "Pass-through Income Treatment", "text": "The TCJA provides preferential tax treatment to income from pass-through entities, but the House and Senate versions each achieve that goal in very different ways. The House version of the TCJA proposes to tax a portion of pass-through income at a reduced maximum marginal rate of 25 percent. The Senate version of the TCJA provides a 23 percent deduction business income instead of the House's 25 percent marginal rate. Under current law, income from farms organized as pass-through 5 Along with the above mentioned business forms, farms may also choose to form a hybrid-type business structure known as a Limited Liability Company (LLC), which are registered by individual states and regulated by state statutes. An LLC may be organized as a sole proprietorship, partnership, or S or C corporation, and it is up the members to elect the organizational designation. An LLC is in many ways similar to other pass-through entities (except for those organized as C corporations), namely that the profit or loss from the business is distributed to the members (owners) and each member pays taxes on the profit (recognizes the loss) at the individual level on their personal income tax returns. In this sense the LLC is a \"pass-through\" entity. entities (sole proprietorships, partnerships, and S-corporations) are taxed at the individual level and may be subject to statutory maximum rate of up to 39.6 percent."}, {"section_title": "Standard and Itemized Deductions", "text": "Under the TCJA, all itemized deductions would be eliminated except deductions for mortgage interest and charitable donations. Personal exemptions would be eliminated and the standard deduction would be nearly doubled for a single individual from its current $6,300; married individuals filing jointly would be allowed a standard deduction of around $24,000."}, {"section_title": "Child Tax Credit", "text": "The total child tax credit is increased to $1,600, in the House Bill, $2,000 in the Senate version, up from $1,000 under current law. However, the refundable portion of the child tax credits remains the same as current law. The phase-out threshold for the credit for married individuals filing jointly is also increased. Under the House Bill, the credit would not face a phase-out of the credit until earnings reach $150,000; under current law the phase-out begins at $110,000. The Senate version is more generous and sets the phase-out level at $500,000."}, {"section_title": "Alternative Minimum Tax", "text": "The House version of TCJA eliminates the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT). We estimate that, under current law, 3.4 percent of farms would owe AMT tax in 2016 for an average amount of $8,366, conditional on owing tax. Because AMT targets higher income individuals, it is not surprising that small farms were the least likely to owe AMT (1.6 percent) since they have on average lower adjusted gross incomes (AGI) than midsize and larger farms. In contrast, about 39 percent of large farms owed AMT for an average amount of $10,761."}, {"section_title": "Long Term Capital Gains", "text": "The TCJA maintains all aspects of current law regarding the long term capital gains taxation with the exception of the net investment tax. The current tax rate on long-term capital gains is 0 percent for taxpayers in the 10 or 15 percent income tax brackets, 15 percent for taxpayers who are below the 39.6 percent income tax bracket, and 20 percent for those in the 39.6 percent bracket. The net investment tax is a 3.8 percent surtax assessed on certain high-income taxpayers. Under current law, many of the assets used in farming or ranching are eligible for capital gains treatment including breeding, dairy, draft, and sporting purpose livestock. In 2016, USDA survey data suggests about 36 percent of all family farms reported some capital gains or losses, both from the sale of farm assets and non-farm assets while IRS data indicates the average individual taxpayer is far less likely to report a capital gain or loss (13.6 percent). In additional to reducing the capital gains taxes paid, a reduction in the tax on capital gains could have a significant impact on the land market. In terms of value, land represents the largest asset by held farms, and because appreciation in land's value is considered a capital gain and realized upon its sale, a reduction in the capital gains may increase the incentive for farm land sales by reducing the so-called \"lock-in effect\" whereby assets are held longer, all else equal, in order to forego the tax on the gain."}, {"section_title": "Farm Business Deductions", "text": "Section 179 of the Internal Revenue Code allows a taxpayer to recover the cost of investments by deducting or \"expensing\" the equipment in the year of the purchase, within certain limits. In addition to Section 179, Section 168(k) allows farmers to take \"bonus depreciation\" beyond the Section 179 limits. The two provisions may be used in coordination, which has meant that much of the capital purchases made during the past decade were eligible to be completely deducted in the first year. Under the TCJA, capital cost recovery through the section 179 deduction will not be limited to a maximum amount, but instead the deduction will be allowed to the extent of the cost of the investment. Under the House version of the TCJA, the maximum amount is increased to $5,000,000; the aggregate investment limit is $20,000,000 before deduction phases out. Under current law in 2017, the maximum amount of investment cost that can be deducted under section 179 is $510,000; the aggregate investment limit is $2,000,000 before deduction phases out. While recent evidence of the effect of cost recovery provisions in the tax code suggests that the deductions can have an effect on incremental investment, the effect is likely to be small. In the case of section 179, it was reported that for every $1,000 increase in the section 179 expensing amount, farms that had been previously constrained by the section 179 limit made an incremental capital investment of between $320 and $1,110 (Williamson and Stutzman, 2016). Under current law, interest paid on debt that is used to finance the purchase of business property or to finance business activity is generally deductible by the farm as an expense. 6 In 2016, the farm sector reported paying $8.7 billion in total interest (excluding interest paid on the operator's dwelling). Under the TCJA, the business interest deduction is limited to 30 percent of business income, while businesses with less than $25 million of gross receipts are exempt from the limitation. The deduction can be of significant value to some farms, and the tax value of the deduction varies by the farm's marginal tax rate. Conditional on having an interest expense, the average amount reported by a farm in 2016 was $14,297. Overall, larger farms carry more debt and thus have larger interest expenses than smaller farms. Small farms reported an average of $6,994, while mid-sized farms had $23,607. Large farms had more than twice the interest expense of midsized farms ($49,544), potentially worth $19,619 in expense deductions if the farm is in the top marginal tax bracket. The TCJA eliminates the Domestic Activities Production deduction. An estimated 7 percent of farms directly benefit from the section 199 deduction. The deduction is limited to the lesser of 9 percent of adjusted gross income from domestic production activities income or, 50 percent of wages paid to produce income from domestic production activities. While the wages-paid provision limits the applicability of the deduction for many smaller farms that hire little or no labor, larger farms do have significant labor expenses. In 2016, family farms had nearly $28 billion in labor expenses. The average deduction for eligible farm households-those with labor expenses and income from qualified production activity-was $5,669. Among farms, commercial farm households are the primary beneficiaries since they are more likely to report both positive farm income and wages paid to hired labor. Farmer-owned cooperatives are also eligible for the section 199 deduction, and the cooperative may return the deduction to its members-owners when it pays out patronage dividends. The value of the deduction to the farmer is based on his/her effective marginal tax rate; the higher the rate the great the value of the deduction. In 2016, nearly 290,000 farm households (about 14 percent of all farm households) reported receiving patronage dividend income, and on average the amount was $4,356, for a total of $1.26 billion."}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "We use farm-household level data from the Agricultural Resource Management Surveys for 2007 to 2016. These datasets provide information about the farm businesses operation and also data on the household of the survey responder. Sample weights are provided that target a representation of the farm population in the United States. We clean the raw data and convert all nominal values into 2016 real dollars. We drop observations missing data for total household income or farm business income. For observations missing other variables such as dividends received, capital gains, and household expenses; we input a zero. 7 We use the annual CPI to deflate all nominal values into 2016 real dollars. We choose the annual CPI measure because under current tax law, it is used to adjust income tax brackets and other tax code variables for inflation. Farm businesses legally constituted as a subchapter C corporation are dropped from the sample. As mentioned in the previous section, the overwhelming majority of farms businesses are constituted as pass-through entities for tax purposes and corporations make a little over 1 percent of the weighted sample for any given year. We exclude households of C corporation farms because we do not have information regarding the corporation as a whole but only about the farm operation being surveyed. Hence, the necessary information to compute taxes paid under the corporate tax code is missing; furthermore, the farm household information would not distinguish whether the income received from this farm operation was in the form of wages, dividends, profit sharing or other forms of compensation. Table 2 presents descriptive statistics of the cleaned dataset. For every year other than 2016, the dataset targets over 2 million farms (weighted frequency) through approximately 20,000 actual observations in most years. The number of farms (not including those registered as corporations) have shown a steady decline over the last decade. Average farm household income is well above that of the general population. The income numbers show two contrasting time periods in the dataset: lower income for the first half of the decade and improving and booming average income for the latter half. The summary of income components in Table 2 illustrates the varied sources of income farm households receive. In 2016, total average income for a farm household was $117,881, with wages from off-farm earnings making up the greatest source of earnings overall. Pass-through income, coming from the farm operation and from other farm business endeavors, was a combined $44,726. Farm households also had earnings from off-farm business, $11,658 on average, also pass-through income. Sources of capital gains, were on average, smaller in amount-$1,307 on average from off-farm capital gains sources, and $1,055 from farm capital gains."}, {"section_title": "Tax Simulations", "text": "We built a model that estimates personal income and payroll taxes at the farm household level using the dataset presented in the previous section. Our model is rich in detail and accounts for the majority of components contained in a indivdual income tax return (IRS Form 1040). With the data, we can estimate provisions such as the alternative minimum tax, long term capital gains, earned income credit, child credits, self-employment (SE) taxes, itemized deductions and others. An online appendix contains the full details of the model including the programming codes used in this article. We provide a comparison of tax estimates under 3 different tax regimes over a 10 year period. The \"current law\" regime uses the regulations, rates and thresholds of the 2016 tax code. There are two \"reform\" regimes based on the TCJA: one sets parameters and regulations found in the House version of the bill (passed on November 16, 2017) and the other sets parameters and regulations found in the Senate version of the Bill (passed on December 2, 2017). The use of household-level data for a 10 year period gives our tax reform analysis an edge over competing analysis. Since, we use household-level data from the 2007 to 2016 period, our estimates account for external shocks and show the performance of the different tax regimes over a whole business cycle (contraction and expansion).In contrast to our study, most reports on the subject of tax reform present effects over a 10 year period into the future. These analyses must make assumptions regarding the growth rate of the economy and most importantly, they do not account for the presence of business cycles which are important features of the economy as we were painfully reminded during the Great Recession. As well, major reforms to the tax code are few and apart through time; thus, it is highly likely that a given tax regime would be in place through recession and expansion periods of the economy. Figure 3 shows that both versions of the TCJA significantly reduce the tax liability of farm households over the 10 year period: $60 billion under the House Bill and about $76 billion under the Senate Bill. While both tax reforms have similar costs, the type of tax that accounts for the reduced liability is different for each plan. Under the House Bill, personal federal income tax liability is reduced by about $23 billion, while the self-employment (SE) tax accounts for $36 billion of the tax reduction. In contrast, under the Senate Bill all but $0.016 billion is due to a reduction in income taxes. The small loss in SE taxes under the Senate Bill is driven uniquely by the repeal of the Additional Medicare Tax. On the other hand, the House plan considers 70 percent of the pass-through income as wages to be taxed under ordinary income and thus only the remainder 30 percent is subject to SE taxes."}, {"section_title": "Aggregate Tax Liabilities and Allocation of Tax", "text": "The Alternative Minimum Tax, eliminated in the House version of TCJA, is estimated to tax liability by close to $10 billion over the 10 year period under current law. From Figure 4 we can clearly see that this tax pro-cyclical with respect to farm household income and thus higher tax revenues from this tax item were collected during the latter half of the 10 year period. Table 3 provides average values for total income, wages and farm income for taxpayers owing AMT versus those who don't. For 2014, the year of peak farm income, we estimate that AMT affected 6 percent of farm households who had an average AMT liability of $9,425. For all other years, less than 5 percent of farm households see any liability from AMT. The average income figures for the group that owes AMT are considerably higher than the values for the group not owing AMT. During the expansion cycle, farm income for the group with AMT liabilities is more than 10 times that of the group with no liabilities while, during the contractionary period, the factor is between 25 to over 100. We estimate that the Senate version of AMT would bring tax liabilities of $2 billion in excess of those under current law over the ten year period. The purpose of AMT is to limit the amount of itemized deductions and exemptions that high income households can claim. Since many deduction, exemptions and credits have income phase-out levels, the AMT falls primarily on high middle income households. The Senate Bill raises the exemption amounts and income thresholds of AMT but also eliminates the income limitations on itemized deductions thus allowing high income households to claim itemized deductions. Table 3 shows that average income and wages for households liable for AMT in the Senate plan is significantly higher than the same group under current law. Furthermore, the average AMT liability is about double under the Senate Plan."}, {"section_title": "Average Effective Tax Rates", "text": "Effective tax rates illustrate the actual tax burden imposed on taxpayers under the different tax models. We follow the literature at large and use the following definition for average effective tax rates: where N is the number of subjects in the group, \u03c4 i is the tax liability or refund of taxpayer i, M i is total income (inclusive of capital gains) of taxpayer i and \u03c9 i is the sample weight. This definition of average effective rates allows us to circumvent the problem of computing effective rates for individual taxpayers with tax refunds (negative tax) and negative incomes. The issue of negative taxes is important in this article as our federal income tax estimates are net of other taxes and credits (earned income credit and child tax credits). The aggregate average effective rates for federal income tax and SE tax decrease under both versions of TCJA. Table 4 presents the estimated effective rates for the years between 2007 and 2016. The TCJA reduces the average effective rate of total taxes (federal income tax plus SE tax) by 2.6 percentage points in the House Bill and 3.3 percentage points in 2016. As expected from the discussion of tax revenues, the Senate Bill does not change the average effective rate of the SE tax while the House Bill reduces the effective SE tax by 1.5 percentage points. The average effective tax rates by income groups exhibit considerable variation which is masked in the aggregate measures. Table 6 shows the effective tax rates by income group across the years. 8 Effective average tax rates for farm households in the middle range of the income distribution (20-80th percentile of income) are much lower than the overall average. These farm households would see their effective federal income tax rate fall under the TCJA, but not by as much as the average farm household, or between 0.5 and 1.6 percentage points. Further, farm households in this group face a higher average SE tax rate than farm households overall under all tax scenarios. As expected, the effective average tax rates for farm households in the 90-99th percentile income group are higher than the overall average. Under the House Bill, the 90-99 income group would see a reduction of 3.4 to 4.7 percentage point in their effective total tax rate while the Senate Bill decreases such rate in over 5 percentage points across all years. Because of the income cap on the Social Security portion of the SE tax, the 90-99 income groups faces a lower average SE tax than the overall group. This property is maintained in the tax reform scenarios. Figure 5 examines the allocation of the reduction in taxes, net of SE taxes, across the farm business cycle for the House and Senate versions of the TCJA. The figures represent the percent share of the total tax reduction. Overall, farm households in the top 10 percent of the income distribution receive over 53 percent of the tax reductions proposed in the House version of the TCJA, while they receive 71 percent of the total break under the Senate version. Much of this is the results of the the Senate version allocating greater tax reductions to higher-income farm households-particularly farm households in the top 1 percent-due to lower maximum marginal tax rate and preferential treatment of pass-through income. And much of this gain comes at the expense of farm households in the third quintile income group. Under the House version, farm households in the third quintile income group (40-60th percentile group) experience a larger share of the tax cuts relative to the Senate version. Farm households in the first and second quintiles will also experience smaller breaks under the Senate version of the TCJA, though the change is smaller. Finally, farm households in the bottom quintile of the income distribution are made worse off by TCJA, once SE tax are accounted for. The negative shares for the 20th percentile income group mean that, net of SE tax, they owe more under both the Senate or House version of the tax reform, relative to current law."}, {"section_title": "Allocation of Tax Breaks", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Progressivity", "text": "The previous section highlighted that there is a heterogeneous impact on average effective tax rate depending on the income group; thus, it is natural to analyze impact of tax reform on the progressivity of the tax system. Our estimates show a sizeable reduction in farm household tax liability; therefore, we examine the allocation of these tax savings among the different types of farm households. Finally, we also highlight the evolution of the progressivity measure along the cycle for farm household income."}, {"section_title": "Progressivity in the Tax Code", "text": "To gauge the progressivity of the tax code we compute the Stroup index for the different tax code scenarios using a modified Gini coefficient that allows for negative income. Stroup (2005) proposed a measure for tax progressivity which is analogous to that of the Gini coefficient. 9 The interpretation is simple: the extreme value of 1 indicates a tax system in which the richest person pays all taxes while zero indicates that all tax liability falls in the poorest person. The advantage of the Stroup index is that it accounts for the underlying income inequality in the data. Since we are interested in the performance of the tax policy over the farm business cycle, it is important to account for the potential changes in income inequality during the contraction period and then in the expansionary period. Figures 6 and 7 show the time series of the computed Stroup index for federal individual income tax and total taxes (income taxes plus SE taxes), respectively. We observe that individual income tax progressivity of the current tax code is more stable than that of the TCJA. Surprisingly, progressivity of the individual income tax under current law is counter-cyclical or in other words, it becomes less progressive when farm income is higher. When total taxes are considered, the Stroup index values under current law present little variability over the time period. Using only individual income taxes as the tax measure, we find that the TCJA results in a less progressive system across all years. Figure 6 clearly shows that the Stroup index is consistently lower than current law over the study period. The difference in the progressivity relative to current law becomes more pronounced during the period of low income (2007)(2008)(2009)(2010)(2011) and then catches up partially due to the decrease in progressivity of the current law for the latter half of the sample period. This property once again highlights the importance importance of considering the properties of tax system over a business cycle and not only over periods of growth. Using total taxes as the tax measure provides an interesting result for the House version of tax reform: the progressivity relative to current law shift from less to more in sync with the business cycle of farm incomes. From Figure 7 we can immediately observe that the Stroup index values for current law and the House plan cross between 2011 and 2012. The time period to the left of this point is characterized by lower farm incomes over the ten-year cycle, and the resulting Stroup indexes portray a less progressive system under the reform plan. In contrast, the latter half of the time period in our sample is characterized by higher incomes and the estimated Stroup indexes point to a more progressive system under the House version of tax reform."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "In this paper we examine impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act's on farm household tax liabilities and compare them to current Law. The TCJA calls for the elimination of most itemized deductions, a modification of credits for children and dependents, as well as restructuring of tax brackets, and taxing capital gains income at a lower rate, relative to current law. Under current law, income from farms organized as pass-through entities (sole proprietorships, partnerships, and S corporations) are taxed at the individual level and therefore may be subject to statutory maximum rate of up to 39.6 percent. Among its other provisions, the TCJA lowers the maximum marginal tax rate on farm income for farms organized as passthroughs. Under both versions of TCJA, the aggregate average effective rates tax decrease relative to current law. The TCJA reduces the average effective rate of total taxes (federal income tax plus self-employment taxes) by 2.6 percentage points in the House Bill and 3.3 percentage points in 2016. On the other hand, the changes are not distributed uniformly across income groups, with the top ten percent of farm household accruing between 50 and 70 percent of the total tax cuts made under the TCJA. Consequently, the TCJA reduces the progressivity of the tax code, as much of the tax breaks instituted by the Act, are accrued by higher-income farm households.          10,15,25,28,33,35,and 39.6% Four tax brackets: 12,25,35,39.6% Seven brackets: 10,12,22,24,32,35,38.5 Long Maximum marginal rate of 25%, applies to 30 percent of net business income."}, {"section_title": "Figures and Tables", "text": "Allow individuals to deduct 23.0 percent of \"domestic qualified business income\" earned through a pass-through business (partnership, S-Corporation or sole proprietorship)."}, {"section_title": "Expensing Provisions", "text": "Section 179 maximum amount $500,000; investment limit of $2,000,000 before deduction phases out.
