To the present, both amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have been most useful biomarkers, showing good sensitivity and specificity (amyloid PET, 82% and 95% [1] ; CSF beta-amyloid (Ab) , 96.4% and 76.9% [2] ). However, these methods have some disadvantages that prevent them from coming into wide use, such as high cost, difficulty of ligand synthesis, and high invasiveness. Blood testing has been considered to offer another possible biomarker of AD, and it is less costly and invasive than PET and CSF. Recently, rapid progressing protein analysis has found some proteins as possible plasma biomarker candidates of AD. Proteomic analysis reported that plasma concentrations of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) protein and related proteins (e.g., Apo-A1, Apo-A2M) were identified as preclinical biomarkers of neocortical amyloid burden [3, 4] , and other studies reported that combinations of plasma proteins and other clinical information could predict neocortical amyloid burden [5, 6] .\nBecause Ab accumulates in cerebral cortex and is detected in both CSF and plasma, plasma Ab is one of the hopeful biomarker candidates of AD. Some studies examined plasma Ab as a predictor of AD [7] [8] [9] , but the results were inconsistent. Recently, two large-scale multicenter studies, Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), successively reported a correlation between amyloid PET and blood test. The AIBL study reported that Ab 1-42 /Ab 1-40 was negatively correlated with the neocortical Ab burden evaluated by [ 11 C]PiB uptake [10] . On the other hand, the ADNI study reported a positive correlation between plasma Ab 1-40 /Ab 1-42 and [\n11 C]PiB uptake, although this correlation was shown only in subjects without ApoE-\u03b54 [11] .\nIn this study, we examined the correlation between plasma Ab and the results of amyloid PET imaging with [ 18 F]florbetapir in a Japanese population and a singlecenter study setting. We also tried to verify the effect of ApoE on the relationship between plasma Ab and Ab accumulation."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects", "text": "We analyzed 117 Japanese participants (49 males and 68 females).

The criteria for dementia were based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder (Fourth Edition, text revision). Participants diagnosed with dementia because of other general medical conditions were evaluated if they met the criteria for dementia with Lewy bodies [13] or frontotemporal lobe dementia [14] .

However, compared with the non-E4 group, the E4 group had significantly higher SUVR (t 5 22.27, df 5 115, P 5 .03), rate of Ab positivity (chi-square 5 7.54, df 5 1, P 5 .006), Ab (Fig. 2) .

There was a significant difference between AUC of non-E4 group and a random classifier (P 5.01). Positive predictive value (PPV) was 44.1% and negative predictive value (NPV) was 93.3%."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Our results from a Japanese population could not reconfirm the finding that plasma Ab 1-42 /Ab 1-40 was correlated with the degree of Ab accumulation as reported by the AIBL study [10] , but they did support the hypothesis that this correlation differed according to the ApoE phenotype as indicated by the ADNI study [11] . Compared with multicenter studies, a single-center study has reported larger intervention effects [18] , whereas in multicenter studies, standardization of the methods to maintain the quality of the examinations is required, and sometimes this is difficult because of disparities among the various facilities. Both our study (single-center study, Japanese participants) and the ADNI study (multicenter study, most participants were Caucasian) demonstrated the same association of plasma Ab, the degree of Ab accumulation varied according to ApoE phenotype, and therefore our study was important for allowing us to generalize the results that Ab 1-42 /Ab 1-40 may be correlated with the accumulation of Ab among non-E4 subjects.\nThe extracellular concentration of Ab might be a result of the balance between synthesis and clearance rates of Ab. A previous study reported that human ApoE allele might differentially regulate the clearance of Ab from the brain and that the clearance of soluble Ab from brain interstitial fluid depends on the isoform of the human ApoE expressed (ApoE4 , ApoE3 , ApoE2) [19] . Permeability of bloodbrain barrier (BBB) might be another factor to account for the correlation between plasma Ab and cortical Ab accumulation. We suppose that Ab excretion mechanisms through BBB might account for the small contribution of plasma Ab and ApoE4 toward the variance in SUVR, because the correlation between Ab and cortical Ab accumulation in CSF samples [20] was stronger than in plasma samples.\nAnother interesting finding was that plasma Ab 1-42 /Ab 1-40 in the non-E4 group showed strong sensitivity (92.9%), NPV (93.3%), and the negative likelihood ratio was 0.16 for Ab positivity by amyloid PET. A previous study of other minimally invasive biomarkers for MCI converting to AD reported an AUC of combined cytokine, clinical measures, and ApoE genotype of 0.61 [21] . In that study, the combination of cytokine and magnetic resonance imaging showed the best AUC of 0.78, sensitivity of 0.75, specificity of 0.78, PPV of 0.75, and NPVof 0.78 [21] . It has been reported that the ApoE-\u03b53 allele is present in 50% to 90% of people of all populations, whereas ApoE-\u03b54 is present in 5% to 35% and ApoE-\u03b52 in 1% to 5% [22] . Our results suggested that Ab 1-42 /Ab 1-40 among non-E4 subjects represented good screening for excluding subjects not needing unnecessary cost and exposure, because the prevalence of cortical Ab positivity is known not to be so high in non-E4 subjects. However, E4 subjects and non-E4 subjects with lower plasma Ab 1-42 /Ab 1-40 need to undergo further testing with high specificity for Ab positivity, as lower PPV of plasma Ab 1-42 /Ab 1-40 among the non-E4 group and ApoE4 is known to be a high-risk factor of AD.\nWe need to acknowledge several methodological limitations in our study. First, we studied only 117 subjects, so this result will need to be verified with a larger number of subjects in the future. Second, our subjects comprised three clinically diagnosed groups. Therefore, one might suppose that our results may have been driven primarily by the effect of diagnosis. Unfortunately, our study group, especially the E4 group, was not sufficiently large to allow analyses within each clinically diagnosed group, so we could not exclude the possibility of a diagnosis effect. Third, our non-E4 group contained ApoE2, ApoE3, and ApoE5. Although the phenotype of ApoE might influence the clearance of Ab, the number of these subgroups was not large enough to allow analyses within them. Thus, further study will be needed to address whether the relationship of Ab 1-42 /Ab and SUVR differed only with ApoE4 or also with other ApoE phenotypes. Finally, we should conduct further study among subjects with suspected asymptomatic to preclinical stage of AD to clarify the usefulness of Ab 1-42 /Ab 1-40 as an AD biomarker. In conclusion, the relationship of Ab 1-42 /Ab 1-40 and SUVR was affected by ApoE phenotype. Although this correlation was very weak for a differential diagnosis, our results suggested that plasma Ab 1-42 /Ab 1-40 , especially among non-E4 subjects, might be a possible screening modality for deciding whether subjects should be examined by amyloid PET or not in clinical settings."}]
