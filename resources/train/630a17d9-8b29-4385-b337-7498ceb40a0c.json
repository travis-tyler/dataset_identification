[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Tropical cloud clusters (TCCs) are traditionally defined as synoptic-scale areas of deep convection and associated cirrus outflow. They play a critical role in the energy balance of the tropics, releasing large amounts of latent heat high in the troposphere. If conditions are favorable, TCCs can develop into tropical cyclones (TCs), which put coastal populations at risk. Previous work, usually connected with large field campaigns, has investigated TCC characteristics over small areas and time periods. Recently, developments in satellite reanalysis and global best track assimilation have allowed for the creation of a much more extensive database of TCC activity. The authors use the TCC database to produce an extensive global analysis of TCCs, focusing on TCC climatology, variability, and genesis productivity (GP) over a 28-yr period . While global TCC frequency was fairly consistent over the time period, with relatively small interannual variability and no noticeable trend, regional analyses show a high degree of interannual variability with clear trends in some regions. Approximately 1600 TCCs develop around the globe each year; about 6.4% of those develop into TCs. The eastern North Pacific Ocean (EPAC) basin produces the highest number of TCCs (per unit area) in a given year, but the western North Pacific Ocean (WPAC) basin has the highest GP (;12%). Annual TCC frequency in some basins exhibits a strong correlation to sea surface temperatures (SSTs), particularly in the EPAC, North Atlantic Ocean, and WPAC. However, GP is not as sensitive to SST, supporting the hypothesis that the tropical cyclogenesis process is most sensitive to atmospheric dynamical considerations such as vertical wind shear and large-scale vorticity."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "A tropical cloud cluster (TCC) has been defined as large, concentrated convection, similar to a mesoscale convective system (MCS), with a diameter of 250-2500 km (including cirrus outflow), lasting at least 6-24 h, and forming over a tropical oceanic basin (e.g., Maddox 1981) . TCCs have also been traditionally viewed (as in this study) as synoptic-scale systems composed of multiple MCSs, connected by a large cirrus shield, and lasting for a period of days (e.g., McBride and Zehr 1981; Lee 1989) . Their appearance on infrared (IR) satellite imagery is normally quite obvious, since the expansive cirrus shield TCCs produce exhibits very cold cloud tops relative to the warmer low-level clouds and the ocean beneath (Mapes and Houze 1993) .\nTCCs are important components of the tropical system and can engender thermal and dynamic changes at local and regional scales. Locally, TCCs transport significant amounts of energy from the ocean and lower sections of the atmosphere into the upper troposphere (Houze 1982) . They also create upper-level clouds, which can contribute to upper-level heating through the absorption of longwave radiation, and reflect shortwave radiation back toward space. At regional scales, Hartmann et al. (1984) showed that TCCs influence the heating profile and dynamics of the Walker circulation. Of course, TCCs can also develop into tropical cyclones (TCs), which can have significant physical and societal impacts.\nTCCs form in a number of different environments throughout the world. In the North Atlantic Ocean (NATL), easterly waves moving off the African coast often spawn TCCs. Chen et al. (2008) showed that approximately 60% of all tropical cyclones that form in the Atlantic basin develop from these easterly waves. While easterly waves can also support TCCs in the Pacific Ocean basin, the monsoonal trough is also a productive area for producing TCCs (Lee 1989) as well as TCs. Chen et al. (2008) showed that 71% of TCs in the western North Pacific Ocean (WPAC) basin are produced in the monsoonal trough. In the North Indian Ocean (NIND), monsoonal circulations also contribute to the formation of TCCs. However, it is only during the transitional seasons of spring and autumn that these features are located far enough south into the Indian Ocean to generate TCCs that have the potential to become tropical cyclones (Lee 1989) . Other atmospheric events, such as mixed Rossby-gravity waves, equatorial Rossby waves, Kelvin waves, and the Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) can help to enhance convection within monsoonal troughs near the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ; Frank and Roundy 2006) , leading to TCC development. Other relevant work includes Maloney and Hartmann (2000) , who showed how convective activity in the eastern North Pacific Ocean (EPAC) basin is influenced by the MJO phase there, and Leroy and Wheeler (2008) , who demonstrated the importance of the MJO phase in predicting tropical cyclogenesis in the Southern Hemisphere.\nThe nature of individual TCCs has been well documented. In general, TCCs tend to exhibit a strong diurnal cycle, with a peak in deep convection before dawn. They have very cold cloud top temperatures; previous studies (e.g., Williams and Houze 1987; Mapes and Houze 1993; Hennon et al. 2011 ) have used temperature thresholds of 205-235 K to identify TCCs. Similar to TCs, TCCs tend to move in the direction of the larger-scale planetary circulation. Past studies have also viewed TCCs from a mesoscale perspective (e.g., Mapes and Houze 1993; Chen et al. 1996; Kerns and Chen 2013) . Although they focus on the smaller-scale convective features of TCCs and are not climatologies per se, these papers are complimentary to this work and extend our understanding of the nature of TCCs.\nA number of automated tracking algorithms have been developed to produce TCC datasets. Williams and Houze (1987) developed a tracker to investigate TCCs off the coast of Borneo. Using Geostationary Meteorological Satellite-1 (GMS-1) IR brightness temperature data, they successfully tracked TCCs that formed during the Winter Monsoon Experiment (WMONEX). A more recent tracker was developed by Kerns and Zipser (2009 Knapp et al. 2010 )] led to a new global TCC tracking algorithm . The algorithm adopted a similar TCC definition used in Hennon and Hobgood (2003) alongside an added IR brightness temperature T(b) threshold tailored for each basin. This IR brightness temperature is similar to the cold IR satellite temperature thresholds used in previous studies (Williams and Houze 1987; Mapes and Houze 1993) . A dataset was created from this single channel dataset that cataloged TCCs from 1982 to 2009; it contains information regarding a TCC's size, location, convective intensity, cloud top height, and development status.\nThis paper will present an analysis of the Hennon et al. (2011) TCC dataset. There have been numerous studies that have investigated the nature of satellite-detected tropical convection from a global perspective (e.g., Mohr and Zipser 1996; Nesbitt et al. 2000) . This research goes beyond these earlier efforts by substantially increasing the temporal scale of the survey (28 years versus one season), expanding the scope by investigating interannual and interdecadal variability, and investigating the global and regional tropical cyclogenesis production. To our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive global survey of TCCs to date.\nThe following section will briefly describe the TCC dataset, including how a TCC is defined. The results begin in section 3, which presents a global perspective of TCC activity. Section 4 focuses on regional TCC characteristics in several ocean basins. A summary and ideas for future work are presented in section 5."}, {"section_title": "Cloud cluster dataset", "text": "We use the global TCC data, version v01r01, described in Hennon et al. (2011) for this work. TCCs were objectively identified in GridSat-calibrated IR data (8-km spatial resolution; see Knapp et al. 2011 ) based on the characteristics of atmospheric convection, including size, shape, and persistence. Table 1 shows the IR brightness temperature thresholds used in each ocean basin by the algorithm. ''Developing'' TCCs, or those clusters that formed into a tropical cyclone, are identified by comparing their locations with the IBTrACS global best track data (Knapp et al. 2010) . TCCs are tracked through time by an automated tracker that searches back in the 3-hourly GridSat data for previous TCC locations. Numerous variables are calculated for each ''fix'' and recorded in the dataset, including T(b). The data contain 28 years ) of global TCC activity, derived from numerous geostationary satellites. As with the GridSat data, the TCC data are provided in 3-hourly time increments. Mature TCs are removed from the TCC dataset. Hennon et al. (2011) contains technical details of the tracking algorithm, including thresholds, searching routines, and the application of IBTrACS to determine development.\nTwo important shortcomings of the TCC data have made it necessary to adjust the way in which the data are used and presented. First, the TCC algorithm does not detect all developing clusters (those that form into a tropical cyclone and are tracked by a forecast center). About 25% of TCs listed in IBTrACS are not tracked prior to genesis. Hennon et al. (2011) speculate on the reasons for these ''missed'' storms, which include TCs that form close to land, develop rapidly (such that they did not qualify as a ''cluster'' before genesis), or are missed from incomplete global satellite coverage prior to 1998. Prior to July 1998, there was a large north-south swath spanning 558-858E longitude over the Indian Ocean that was not covered by any geostationary satellite. This was resolved when Meteosat-5 was moved to a longitude of 638E. On average, approximately 170-200 TCCs per year were missed in the Indian Ocean prior to the satellite's repositioning. Therefore, many of the results presented here are partitioned into ''incomplete'' (1982-97) and ''complete'' (1998-2009) coverage eras. We also note that there are some inconsistencies that have been found between reporting agencies that make up the IBTrACS record (Schreck et al. 2012 ) when a storm is tracked by more than one forecast office, but this happens infrequently and the differences are small. However, it should be noted that if there is more than one IBTrACS track for a storm, they were averaged together to produce a single track (see Hennon et al. 2011 for details). To provide a complete picture on global TCC activity, all results presented here that reference developing TCCs (unless noted otherwise) were identified from the IBTrACS data.\nOther important considerations of the TCC dataset must be noted. There are no TCCs initiated poleward of 308 latitude. The algorithm used to create the data eliminated those cases in order to filter out possible midlatitude systems (TCCs that move poleward of 308 are tracked). A survey of the data showed that about 1.3% (1.2%) TCCs in the Northern (Southern) Hemisphere developed into tropical cyclones poleward of 308 latitude, a small contribution to the ;25% missed developers mentioned above.\nSecond, there is a small portion of the EPAC (bounded by 808W to the west and the Isthmus of Panama to the north) that the algorithm incorrectly labels as TCCs of NATL rather than EPAC. In some years, there could be as many as 10-20 (3%-4%) clusters misclassified. Thus, the NATL and EPAC TCC frequency should be viewed with some caution, though we do not believe this error significantly changes the conclusions presented here.\nSea surface temperature (SST) data are used to identify relationships between the ocean and TCC activity. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Optimum Interpolation SST Analysis, version 2 (OIv2), dataset was selected for use (Reynolds et al. 2002) . The OIv2 data are created from a blend of in situ and satellite data and are mapped to a 18 grid. The monthly data were accessed from NOAA Operational Model Archive Distribution System (NOMADS) development group website.\nFinally, we define genesis productivity GP as the percentage of TCCs that develop into a TC. The GP is calculated as\nwhere TC(IBTrACS) is the number of TCs in the IBTrACS dataset for the period and area of interest and TCC(total) is the number of TCCs for the same parameters. If a TC was never identified as a TCC (i.e., if the cluster did not satisfy the tracking requirements at any time prior to being declared a TC), it is included in the numerator but not the denominator of Eq. (1). This occurred for about 25% of all developing cases and may artificially inflate the GP calculations by ,1%, depending on the area and time period. Figure 1 shows how the basin boundaries are defined in the TCC data (light shaded areas); they were slightly modified from the boundaries used in the IBTrACS data. The SST data presented later are calculated from a subset of each basin (dark shaded areas); this was done to make it more convenient to work with the SST data. All SST domains, with the exception of the NATL, extend over the vast majority of the basins. However, since there is a disconnect between the SST and TCC domains, the correlations presented here should be interpreted with some caution. "}, {"section_title": "Global perspective of tropical cloud clusters", "text": "We now present the analysis in two sections, global and basin characteristics. The global section presents an overview of TCC frequency, GP, lifespan, and intensity. This section is followed by a more focused analysis on interesting patterns of TCC activity in selected individual basins, specifically the NATL, EPAC, WPAC, and NIND. Other basins are not further investigated here because of a dearth of activity Recall that TCCs that develop poleward of 308 latitude are excluded from the data, although a few do move into those regions after their formation.\nOutgoing longwave radiation (OLR) has traditionally been used as a proxy for convective activity on many time scales. Although not used for this particular study, Fig. 2b shows the average OLR over the same 1997-2008 period for comparison purposes. Note that the relative minima in OLR generally correspond to active areas of TCC activity, specifically in the ITCZ, SPCZ, eastern Atlantic, and eastern NIND regions. Machado and Rossow (1993) studied land and ocean TCCs (defined using a different IR threshold temperature than in this dataset) over an 8-month period (JanuaryFebruary and July-August 1987-88) and found a similar spatial distribution pattern. In this study, we consider oceanic TCCs only, masking out any TCCs that form or move over land, including what Machado and Rossow showed as especially strong areas of TCC activity over the South American and African continents, particularly in the austral summer months."}, {"section_title": "b.

The GP, shown as a solid line in each figure, varies from year to year but has an average value of 7.7% (6.4%) for the incomplete (complete) data period. Certain basins are more favorable for TC development than others; GP values range FIG. 1. Basin boundaries used for this study.

There is a small but perceivable downward trend in GP values from 1998 to 2009 (;0.05% yr 21 ); a longer data record is required to say with any confidence if this is significant. Noticeably higher GP values are seen in the incomplete coverage era (Fig. 3 , Table 2 ) since 188 TCCs per year, on average, were missed in the Indian Ocean prior to 1998."}, {"section_title": "d. Lifespan", "text": "The data show that approximately 7% of TCCs are able to transition into a TC and suggest that there is a finite period of time whereby a TCC has the opportunity to make this transition. Figure 4 shows the distribution of the lifetimes of both developing (Fig. 4a ) and nondeveloping (Fig. 4b) TCCs. The dark line shows the cumulative distribution of the number of TCCs for each time period. Note that the developing cases in this instance are from the algorithm, not IBTrACS.\nFor the developing cases (Fig. 4a) , about 60% of TCCs form into TCs within 24 h of being identified. Furthermore, 95% of TCCs develop within 60 h of the first identification: only 5% of TCCs develop into TCs after 60 h. These results are reflected in the distribution of the nondeveloping TCCs (Fig. 4b) . Just less than 95% of all nondevelopers persist for 60 h or less. Note that TCCs as defined in the dataset must persist for at least 24 h before being recorded; therefore, there are zero nondeveloping TCCs that had a lifetime of ,24 h. However, developing TCCs (Fig. 4a ) are allowed to form less than 24 h prior to genesis. These preliminary results on TCC lifespan, though exploratory, suggest that there may be critical genesis time thresholds. Further investigation in this area is warranted but is beyond the scope of the current study."}, {"section_title": "e. Intensity", "text": "Intensity is more easily defined for TCs, where the maximum sustained wind speed and minimum sea level pressure are commonly used. These variables are not available for TCCs, so another way of quantifying intensity is desired. For this study, we define intensity as the minimum 3-hourly T(b) of the cluster; each 3-hourly minimum is then averaged over its entire non-TC lifespan. The minimum T(b) is the TCC pixel with the lowest cloud top temperature. Note that our intensity definition is probably more indicative of a persistent upward mass flux rather than other harderto-measure indicators like updraft vertical velocity or high radar reflectivity at high altitudes. Other potential intensity data, such as Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM; Simpson et al. 1988) do not provide enough coverage for a meaningful analysis. Figure 5 shows the minimum cloud top temperature for nondeveloping and developing TCCs (from the algorithm, not IBTrACS). Figure 5a (Fig. 5b) covers the time period without (with) full coverage of the Indian Ocean. The linear trend (shown by the dotted line) in the early record (Fig. 5a) shows virtually no slope, indicating that the global average TCC intensity did not change significantly from 1982 to 1997. There is a noticeable separation between the intensity of nondeveloping versus developing TCCs. In general, developing TCCs produce higher (colder) cloud tops; the difference is about 2 K.\nThe nonparametric Mann-Whitney test (Mann and Whitney 1947) , commonly used to determine if differences in medians between two nonnormally distributed, independent datasets are significant, was performed for all of the basins. Tests were performed for both the difference between the mean T(b) and the minimum T(b) of developing versus nondeveloping TCCs. Results showed there were statistically significant differences (at the 95% confidence level) in all basins between developers and nondevelopers in the minimum T(b). For the mean T(b), all basins showed statistically significant differences between developing and nondeveloping TCCs at the 95% confidence level, except for the SIND basin. The differences between developing and nondeveloping minimum T(b) remain in the full coverage period (Fig. 5b) , but now downward linear trends are detected. A nonparametric Mann-Kendall trend significance test produced p values of 0.021 (0.545) for the nondeveloping (developing) time series. Thus, the cooling trend in the nondeveloping TCCs is statistically significant at the 95% confidence level, but not significant for the developing cases. It is unknown if the cooling trends are physical or an artifact from the inclusion of the missing Indian Ocean satellite data (or perhaps a mixture of both). A more focused examination of the NIND TCCs will be presented within the following section."}, {"section_title": "Basin comparisons", "text": "TCCs form throughout the tropics in all ocean basins, though there are differences in atmospheric and oceanic forcing mechanisms in each.

Analyses were done for all other basins, but we focus on these four because of space constraints."}, {"section_title": "a. TCC density", "text": "The total number of TCCs generated by each basin in a year were counted and normalized by the basin area. Fig. 6 shows the TCC density for the four basins. In comparison to all basins, the three most prolific in terms of average density are the EPAC (11.47 3 10 26 TCC km 22 yr"}, {"section_title": "21", "text": "), WPAC (10.95), and NATL (9.02). TCC generation in the EPAC is driven primarily by the equatorial trough, with enhancement likely from easterly waves (Serra et al. 2008) , the Madden-Julian oscillation (Maloney and Hartmann 2000) , and Kelvin waves (Schreck and Molinari 2011) . Some mechanisms in the WPAC for creating TCs (and, assumedly, most TCCs) were discussed in Ritchie and Holland (1999) ; the identified patterns include the monsoon shear line, monsoon confluence region, monsoon gyre, and easterly waves. NATL TCC generation is related to the ITCZ (these clusters typically do not develop into TCs), easterly waves (e.g., Thorncroft and Hodges 2001) , and instabilities jettisoned from midlatitude systems. Table 4 shows the annual averages for the rest of the basins as well as the global average (7.69 3 10 26 TCC km 22 yr 21 ).\nAlthough there is no discernible trend in TCC activity globally (Fig. 3) , there are some notable trends in individual basins. For example, TCC activity in the NATL has increased by about 25% over the 28-yr data period. The Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), a mode of variability that describes long-term changes in the Atlantic SST, has been positively connected to Atlantic Ocean TC activity (Goldenberg et al. 2001) and is a plausible explanation for the increase in TCC activity.\nA similar increase in TCC frequency over the period of record is seen in the WPAC (;20%). Whereas the NATL TCC numbers appear to gradually increase beginning in the mid-1990s, the WPAC exhibit two distinct periods of activity: less active from 1982 to 1998 and more active from 1999 to 2009. As we will see in the following section, this dramatic increase in TCC activity did not lead to a corresponding increase in TC development.\nOther basins, with the exception of the Indian Ocean basins, show little or no trend. There is little doubt that increases in TCCs for the Indian Ocean are at least partially caused by the satellite coverage discontinuity in the late 1990s. However, there is evidence that part of this increase arises from natural interdecadal variability. This will be discussed in section 4d."}, {"section_title": "b. Genesis productivity", "text": "The conditions that allow for TCC generation are usually not sufficient to support the development of TCs. Globally, only 6.4% of TCCs develop into TCs (Table 3) . Although skillfully predicting tropical cyclogenesis remains elusive, there has been a plethora of research that established the necessary conditions required for it to happen (e.g., Gray 1968; Simpson et al. 1997; DeMaria et al. 2001) , including warm SSTs, deep columnar moisture, and favorable upper-level winds. Table 4 shows a comparison of the genesis productivity for individual ocean basins. The WPAC is the most productive basin in the world with just over 12% of TCCs developing into TCs. The SIND basin is also productive (;8.5%), although TCCs are less numerous there. TCCs in the EPAC and the NATL develop, on average, 6% of the time.\nThe annual variability of genesis productivity is shown in Fig. 7 . There is a higher (lower) degree of variance in the data in most basins prior to (since) 1999. Also note the sudden drop in productivity in the WPAC around 1999; this is a result of a decrease in genesis events (;14% drop between the 1982-97 and the 1998-2009 periods; see Cooper and Falvey 2010) and the increase in TCC activity noted in the previous section.\nThere are no obvious differences in NATL variability in the time series.

Relationship to sea surface temperature", "text": "Although past research has shown that warm SSTs are a necessary ingredient for deep tropical convection (e.g., Zhang 1993), it is thought that the adjustment of the tropical moist adiabatic profile makes convective intensity insensitive to SST changes. Tompkins (2001) nicely summarizes recent developments in the connection between SST and tropical convection. Graham and Barnett (1987) established a critical SST value of 27.58C where deep tropical convection occurs, although they note that convective intensity is insensitive to SST above this value. Subsequent modeling work supported these observations. For example, Tompkins and Craig (1999) used a 3D cloud resolving model to investigate the response of convection to the SST in the absence of large-scale flow. They found that convection was ''very insensitive'' to SST, except for an upward shift in altitude of the convection as the SST increases. Thus, if T(b) is used to measure ''intensity'' of convection, there should be a measureable relationship to SST, since higher altitude convection will yield lower T(b) values.\nWe investigated the relationship of TCC frequency to SST by comparing annual averages of each by region (Table 5) "}, {"section_title": "d.

Figs. 8 and 9 show the average number of TCCs that form in a given month for the NATL, EPAC, WPAC, and NIND basins. The EPAC and WPAC resemble a lognormal distribution, with the TCC peak activity coinciding with the warmest SSTs in July-August. The NIND also appears to be lognormal but experiences a much sharper peak in June, coinciding with the normal Southeast Asian monsoon onset in May. Note the cooling of the sea surface in the NIND during mid-tolate summer; this can be attributed to increased mixing from the strengthening monsoonal southwesterlies, as shown in Ramage (1974) . Curiously, the NATL contains a dual peak in TCC frequency, with maxima in May and then October; this could be a manifestation of the midsummer drought (MSD), a bimodal precipitation pattern centered in the Caribbean Sea (e.g., Chen and Taylor 2002) . In general, the data suggest that interannual variability in several basins is closely controlled by atmospheric variability arising from large-scale climatic oscillations such as ENSO. In the following subsections, we will present findings related to interannual and seasonal variability for the NATL, EPAC, WPAC, and NIND basins. "}, {"section_title": "1) NORTH ATLANTIC", "text": "The annual frequency of developing and nondeveloping TCCs for the NATL is shown in Fig. 10 . We highlight two points derived from this figure. First, the total number of TCCs in a given year is related to the number of developing TCCs in that year (R 2 5 0.30), although there are exceptions (e.g., 1989, 1997, and 2006) . Although more TCCs provide more opportunities for genesis, other critical factors such as favorable atmospheric dynamics (e.g., low wind shear and positive low-level relative vorticity) and sufficient moisture must be in place for TCs to form. These conditions are controlled by a large degree by large-scale interannual oscillations, and, in fact, seasonal predictions of TC frequency are heavily based on them. For example, it is well known that ENSO phase is a strong driver of annual TC counts in the North Atlantic (e.g., Landsea 2000) . However, this relationship is not as robust with regards to TCC frequency; we find that the variance explained between the Southern Oscillation index (SOI; a measure of ENSO phase) (Ropelewski and Jones 1987) and TCC numbers in the North Atlantic to be R 2 5 0.12. Second, there is a noticeable upward trend in the numbers of TCCs generated in the North Atlantic (but no such trend in the long-term ''productivity'' of the basin). The basin has produced at least 200 TCCs each year since 1995 (with the exception of 1996). This result is consistent with the hypothesized connection between the AMO and North Atlantic tropical activity (Goldenberg et al. 2001) . A shift in the AMO occurred during the mid-1990s, producing relatively favorable conditions for TCC and TC development since.\nThe variability of annual tropical cyclone numbers has been associated with SST anomalies for some time. A threshold value of 268C has long been used as a necessary requirement for TC formation (e.g., Palm\u00e9 n 1948; Gray 1968); note that this value is lower than the 27.58C threshold for deep convection determined by Graham and Barnett (1987) . Subtropical storms with shallower convection do form over relatively cool SSTs, especially in the NATL. During the NATL hurricane season (early June to late November), the critical SST threshold normally bisects the basin in a northwest-to-southeast-oriented axis, extending from about 148N, 208W northwestward to 308N, 708W. During active TCC seasons, the 268C isotherm is farther north and east during the TC season (not shown), allowing for more TCC development in that part of the NATL basin. After examining active versus inactive TCC seasons, we found that annual differences in TCC numbers arise from variations in the density of TCCs in other parts of the basin as well. Fig. 11 shows a measure of TCC density, composited for three ''inactive'' (1986-88) and three ''active'' (2003-05) TCC seasons for the North Atlantic. The increase in the spatial reach of TCC formation can be seen during the active seasons, especially in the north-central North Atlantic near 458W. Also note the higher frequencies in the active seasons along the easterly wave track from 408W northwestward to around 658W.\nThe changes in SST discussed above may be driven in part by the variability of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). The NAO is an atmospheric pressure oscillation with centers of action focused on the Icelandic low and Azores high (Wallace and Gutzler 1981) . The ''positive'' NAO phase corresponds to strong zonal flow over much of the NATL, which would in turn lead to increased turbulent mixing, surface evaporation, and cooling of the ocean surface. Molinari and MestasNu\u00f1 ez (2003) note that observational and modeling studies have revealed a more nuanced tripole pattern in NATL SST forced by the NAO. Although these effects are most noticeable in the NATL winter, they can carry through the following NATL hurricane season. There is a notable negative correlation between TCC frequency and the NAO index (R 2 5 20.29). Some of the most active NATL seasons in recent years (in terms of TCCs) occurred during the negative phase of the NAO (2005 and , although it should be noted that the secondhighest year in terms of TCC frequency (265) occurred during a positive NAO phase in 1999. Clearly, further investigation on the interplay between the SOI, NAO, SST, and TCC variability in the NATL is warranted. event, the warm SST anomalies in the eastern and central Pacific provide a favorable environment for deep convective activity (R 2 5 20.44 between TCCs and the SOI for the EPAC). Furthermore, the low-level convergent arm of the Walker circulation shifts eastward, producing more favorable conditions for convection. Fig. 12 shows TCC and genesis productivity for the EPAC. Note that many of the peaks shown in the TCC frequency correspond to El Ni\u00f1 o seasons (e.g., 1982, 1987, early 1990s, 1997, and 2002) . Conversely, the quietest seasons (1988, 1989, and 1999 ) occurred during strong La Ni\u00f1 a events. Note that the 1989 season was very favorable for genesis despite the low numbers of genesis candidates.\nDifferences in interannual activity can be clearly seen in Fig. 13 , a density map of TCC frequency for active and inactive seasons. Unlike the NATL, there is no significant expansion of the areal extent of TCC convection. Rather, the ITCZ area produces nearly twice as many TCCs during active seasons.\nCompared to the NATL (R 2 5 0.30), there is a much weaker relationship (R 2 5 0.08) in the EPAC between the total number of TCCs and the number that develop in a given year, suggesting that tropical cyclogenesis in the EPAC is more dependent on regional dynamical considerations such as vertical wind shear and upperlevel divergence; the 1989 season is a prime example of this. There has been recent work connecting the strength and phase of the Madden-Julian oscillation to EPAC tropical cyclogenesis (e.g., Maloney and Hartmann 2000) . Also, Camargo et al. (2007) showed that vertical wind shear was the largest contributor to ENSO-related genesis anomalies in the EPAC."}, {"section_title": "3) WEST PACIFIC", "text": "Interannual variability of TCC frequency in the WPAC is also controlled by ENSO variability (R 2 5 0.45 between WPAC TCCs and the SOI). Fig. 14 is a time series of TCC activity in the WPAC. TCC minima are clearly seen in the same El Ni\u00f1 o years that maxima were observed in the EPAC (1982, 1987, 1992, and 1997) . We attribute this not to any significant changes in the SSTs of the region (the warm pool remains well above any critical SST threshold) but to a general shift of the largescale, low-level convergent region of the Walker circulation from the WPAC toward the central Pacific during El Ni\u00f1 o events (e.g., Rasmusson and Wallace 1983) .\nAs discussed previously, there are indications of a decadal time scale shift in the TCC frequency beginning in 1999. From 1982 to 1998, the WPAC produced an annual average of about 252 TCCs; the mean increased more than 20% in the following decade, producing about 308 TCCs annually. There was not, however, a corresponding increase in tropical cyclogenesis events (in fact, WPAC TCs were ;14% yr 21 less frequent on average from 1999 to 2009). Thus, the genesis productivity dropped sharply in 1999 and remained low through 2009. The shift in WPAC TCC frequency in the late 1990s is echoed in the recent work of Wang et al. (2012) . They show a statistically significant upward trend in early summer precipitation over the main TCC genesis region in the WPAC from 1989 to 2008, with a notable upward shift in the late 1990s. Wang et al. (2012) attribute the increasing precipitation intensity to enhanced trade winds forced by significant trends of eastern (western) Pacific SST cooling (warming). The trades advect moisture and increase convergence in the WPAC. They attribute the trends to natural interdecadal variability in the Pacific; this is certainly an interesting area for further investigation.\nThe correlation of annual TCC frequency and SST in the WPAC arises from adjustments from the ENSO cycle. Fig. 15 shows the TCC frequency for three active years (1999, 2001, and 2009 ) and three inactive years (1982, 1987, and 1992) . All three inactive (active) years correspond to the El Ni\u00f1 o (La Ni\u00f1 a) phase of the ENSO cycle. Fig. 15 clearly shows an eastward shift of TCC frequency, corresponding to the eastward shift of warm SSTs and Walker circulation. Note the decrease in frequency in the western portions of the basin, which is also consistent with the Walker circulation shift. Although SSTs remain very high in this area, broad low-level convergence will be weaker during a warm event."}, {"section_title": "4) NORTH INDIAN", "text": "TCC activity in the North Indian basin is primarily controlled by the Asian monsoon circulation, with a distinct frequency maximum during the summer months and minimum in winter (see Fig. 9b ). However, there is a weaker-than-expected relationship between the ''strength'' of the monsoon circulation and the TCC frequency. FIG. 12 . As in Fig. 10 , but for the EPAC basin. Fig. 16 shows the annual time series of TCC activity and genesis productivity of the North Indian Ocean. As mentioned previously, the jump in annual TCC numbers after 1997 can be partially attributed to the addition of geostationary satellite coverage in July 1998. However, the aforementioned work of Wang et al. (2012) shows that the NIND basin has been consistently ''wetter'' since the late 1990s, suggesting that TCCs may have become more frequent; without observations prior to 1999, it is not possible to know for sure.\nWe find that the correlation between TCC frequency and the South Asian summer monsoon index (a measure of the seasonal variation of the magnitude of the area wind field; see Li and Zeng 2005) is fairly weak (R 2 5 0.14). Furthermore, genesis productivity in the basin is not related to the monsoon strength at all (R 2 5 0.00). The work of Fu and Hsu (2011) suggest that the frequency and intensity of near-equatorial westerly wind bursts associated with MJO events is responsible for creating a large area of cyclonic vorticity in the Bay of Bengal, which makes genesis more likely.\nInterannual variability of TCCs is, however, related to the ENSO cycle (R 2 5 0.34). Typically, a developing El Ni\u00f1 o (La Ni\u00f1 a) leads to drier (wetter) conditions during the monsoon season (e.g., Rasmusson and Carpenter 1983) . However, there are complicating factors, in particular, the interplay between the Indian Ocean dipole (IOD), ENSO, and the Indian monsoon/TCC activity. The IOD describes the west Indian/east Indian dipole in SST; the positive phase has been shown to offset the FIG. 13 . As in Fig. 11 , but for the EPAC domain and (a) active years (1982, 1987, and 1997) and (b) inactive years (1988, 1989, and 1999). negative impact that El Ni\u00f1 o has on Indian rainfall (Ashok et al. 2004 ).\nIt should be noted that 2005 was a hyperactive season in the North Indian basin, particularly in genesis productivity (as was the case in the North Atlantic). Although TCC activity in the NIND is most strongly connected to WPAC TCC frequency (R 2 5 0.37), there is a weaker correlation to NATL TCC activity as well (R 2 5 0.20). This is another area that deserves further investigation."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions a. Summary", "text": "This paper presented an analysis of TCCs as tracked in a 28-yr global dataset. The data were from an objective TCC tracking algorithm that identified clusters according to a threshold of IR brightness temperature, size, shape, and persistence. TCCs occur in nearly all portions of the tropical oceans but are most frequent in regions of enhanced low-level convergence, such as the ITCZ, the SPCZ, and monsoonal troughs. In an average year, the tropics produce about 1600 TCCs, of which less than 7% develop into TCs. The development rate varies considerably by basin.\nMost developing TCCs develop within a short period of time after identification: 60% (95%) develop within 24 (60) hours of their identification. The developers also show a colder average IR brightness temperature (;2-3 K), on average, than the nondevelopers, which suggests that the convective characteristics of TCCs may be an important factor in tropical cyclogenesis.\nA closer investigation of basin TCC characteristics was presented. The EPAC produced the highest number of TCCs per unit area, but the WPAC was the most productive basin for developing TCs (.12%). Some basins had a noticeable trend in TCC frequency with time. In particular, TCCs in the NATL basin have been on the rise, especially since the mid-1990s. Two distinct eras in TCC frequency are found in the WPAC time series, with a noticeable active period beginning in 1999. However, there has not been a corresponding increase in tropical cyclogenesis events, so the overall genesis productivity in the WPAC has, on average, been lower since that time.\nIt has been long known that ENSO is a strong driver of atmospheric convective variability in the Pacific (e.g., Ropelewski and Halpert 1987; Kiladis and Diaz 1989; Dai and Wigley 2000) . The results presented here suggest that TCCs, a specially defined subset of convective features analyzed by these papers, are similarly affected. Anomalous TCC patterns are believed to be driven by zonal shifts of the low-level convergent branch of the Walker circulation, as suggested by Dai and Wigley's (2000) study of ENSO precipitation patterns. El Ni\u00f1 o events suppress TCC frequency in the WPAC; the EPAC sees a corresponding increase in TCC activity. In the NATL, ENSO does not play as strong a role in TCC generation as it does in genesis productivity. However, there is a notable correlation between the phase of the NAO and NATL TCC variability. It is plausible that the enhanced zonal winds that arise from the positive phase of the NAO suppress SSTs over portions of the basin through turbulent mixing of the upper ocean. "}, {"section_title": "b. Future work", "text": "With over 40 000 TCCs in the dataset, there are a number of avenues for future applied research in this area. Statistical prediction schemes for tropical cyclogenesis will benefit from the vast amount of new data. Investigations into variability on shorter time scales, along with the inclusion of atmospheric observations, may yield new paradigms on the relationships between tropical convection and their forcing mechanisms. Variability on longer time scales will become more evident if the length of the TCC time series is updated in future releases.\nThere have been several scientific questions that have been raised here that may lead to new theoretical or observational investigations. In particular, the noticeable shift in WPAC TCC activity beginning in the late 1990s is an interesting area of further research. The upturn in TCC frequency is coincident with a drop in TC frequency, producing a GP well below the 1982-98 period. Matsuura et al. (2003) provide an explanation on the largescale conditions that can lead to WPAC interdecadal FIG. 15 . As in Fig. 11 , but for the WPAC domain and (a) active years (1999, 2001, and 2009 ) and (b) inactive years (1982, 1987, and 1992) .\nTC variability, but, as we have shown here, there is not necessarily a strong relationship between TCC and TC variability. A more focused observational study on TCC activity in that area is needed to formulate a testable theory. Very few (;5%) TCCs persist longer than 60 h without developing into TCs. It remains unclear as to what extent the larger-scale (e.g., large-scale vorticity, upper-level divergence, vertical wind shear, and columnar moisture) or mesoscale and smaller-scale factors (e.g., heat fluxes and cloud physics) determine the fate of the TCC. A complicating issue is that almost all TCCs outside of field campaigns are not directly observed, so we are left with theories that have not been sufficiently tested. Another challenge is that we have no way of determining exactly when TC genesis has occurred, so there is much uncertainty in using time intervals to describe genesis studies. In situ data from recent field campaigns such as the Tropical Cloud Systems and Processes (TCSP) mission (Halverson et al. 2007 ), the Pre-Depression Investigation of Cloud-systems in the Tropics (PREDICT; Montgomery et al. 2011) , and the Genesis and Rapid Intensification Processes (GRIP; Braun et al. 2013 ) experiments will provide new insights into these unanswered questions."}]
