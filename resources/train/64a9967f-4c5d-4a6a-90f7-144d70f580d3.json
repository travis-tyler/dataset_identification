In the United States (US), coastal flooding caused by hurricanes is one of the most costly natural disasters (Lott and Ross 2006). For example, Hurricane Katrina was responsible for financial damages over a hundred billion dollars (USGS, 2005); other significant events were: Hurricane Andrew in 1992 ($40 billion), Hurricane Ike in 2008 ($27 billion), Hurricane Wilma in 2005 ($17 billion) and Hurricane Rita in 2005 ($17 billion) (Lott and Ross 2006). The state of Texas, in particular, has historically faced severe hurricanes, with Ike being the most recent major storm to hit the State. Studies by Emanuel (2005) have shown an increasing destructiveness of tropical cyclones over the past 30 years. While hurricanes are a recurrent threat to coastal communities, climate research arguably indicates a potential increase in the mean sealevel (MSL) due to global warming (Church et al. 2008;Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 2007; Nichols and Cazenave 2010) and hurricane intensification over the next century (Knutson et al. 2010;Elsner et al. 2008).

To manage a potentially increasing coastal flooding hazard, the U.S. invests a considerable amount of resources in mapping floodplains and risk areas. Improvements in the understanding of the physics of storm surge processes have led to the development of hydrodynamic models capable of accurately estimating hurricane flood elevations and floodplains (Resio and Westerink, 2008). However, increasingly higher resolution and complex numerical methods require the use of High Performance Computing (HPC), or supercomputing, for numerical simulation of hurricane storm surge (e.g., Westerink et al [2008], Tanaka et al. [2011]), which makes running these models not user-friendly. To facilitate the assimilation of geospatial information in hurricane storm surge simulation, we propose a novel framework to integrate GIS and hurricane models. In"}, {"section_title": "Chapter 2, Arc StormSurge: Integrating Hurricane Storm Surge Modeling and GIS,", "text": "we describe a geodatabase schema specifically designed to support hurricane storm surge modeling and coastal flood mapping. As part of this framework, a set of ArcGIS tools were developed to pre-and post-process model input/output by connecting the GIS interface with the supercomputing environment and streamlining the coastal floodplain mapping process. A case study simulation of Hurricane Bret is presented to demonstrate the tool's functionality. This framework is also used throughout this dissertation. Through the integration of GIS with the hurricane computational models, it is possible to take full advantage of geospatial information to better represent the physical process involved in calculating storm surge and delineating flooded areas. For example, it is expected that land cover impacts the forcing and dissipation mechanisms of hurricane storm surge, first by interference in the transfer of momentum from the wind to the water column, and second by the dissipation due to frictional drag at the sea bottom. To correctly evaluate the effects of land cover, namely wetlands and other coastal vegetation, on hurricane surge and damage, it is crucial to recognize its spatial location and composition. For the State of Texas, three types of datasets from different agencies are available for selected time periods: 1) The National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD) of 1992(NLCD) of , 2001(NLCD) of and 2006 2) The Coastal Change Analyses Program (C-CAP) of 1996, 2001 and 2006; 3) The National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) from 2011. In Chapter 3, quantification of uncertainty in hurricane storm surge response due to land cover specification, we investigate the effects of these different datasets, as well as the time periods represented, on the surge response for coastal bays in mid Texas coast. We also present a case study for Hurricane Bret, comparing the simulated surge response to measured data. SLR is expected to impact hurricane storm surge in coastal bays by the changes in the bays' geometry (i.e., deeper water depth and larger water surface area) and also by changes to the land cover (i.e., wetlands loses due to permanent inundation) with potential impacts to surge heights and inundation, and most importantly, to damages in coastal communities. The potential of wetlands to reduce storm surge in Louisiana was investigated by Wamsley et al. (2010), and the studies carried out by Loder et al. (2009), demonstrated the importance of correctly representing wetlands when making storm surge simulations. In Chapter 4, Effects of sea-level rise on hurricane storm surge and coastal damage in coastal bays, we quantify the impacts of wetlands degradation by SLR on hurricane storm surge and damage in coastal bays. These impacts are quantified by residuals in the mean maximum surge, the inundated area, by the potential damage to buildings, population and businesses affected.

In the United States, in particular, coastal flooding caused by hurricanes has been one of the most costly natural disasters totaling approximately $370 billion dollars in the last 20 years (Lott and Ross 2006). It is, therefore, indispensable to accurately predict storm surge in an efficient working framework in order to assess an area's flood risk and to facilitate planning and design to minimize its impact. The historical record of storms is too short and too sparse to support reliable statistical predictions of hurricane surge levels; therefore, numerical analysis is used for simulating and predicting flooding in coastal areas. In recent years, improvements in the understanding of the physics of storm surge processes have led to the development of computationally intensive hydrodynamic models capable of estimating hurricane flood elevations (Resio and Westerink 2008). However, entering the input to and interpreting the output from these models can be difficult and tedious, and, usually, the model output is not in a ready format for conveying findings to the public and decision-makers. In this context, Geographical Information Systems (GIS) can play an important role in pre-and post-processing spatial information and supporting input/output visualization. This chapter discusses the development of a data model and set of tools to ease the preparation of the input files of the coupled ADvanced CIRCulation and unstructuredgrid version of Simulating WAves Nearshore (SWAN+ADCIRC) hydrodynamic and wave models through an automated file conversion between the GIS and model formats and the visualization of the results through maps. As part of this working framework, we propose the use of a geodatabase specifically designed to store the spatial information needed for modeling storm surges. Examples of the application of our framework to storm surge simulations for Hurricane Bret in Corpus Christi, Texas, are also included."}, {"section_title": "BACKGROUND", "text": "A review of integration of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and GIS is presented by Wong et al. (2007). Specifically, regarding coastal hydrodynamics, a storm surge numerical forecast model was developed by Yu et al. (2001) and integrated with GIS for querying and visualizing spatial information. In their work, they used two sub-systems: a numerical scheme to calculate the surge and GIS to visualize the results. Another example of CFD and GIS integration is presented by Ng et al. (2009) in which a GIS interface is used to pre-and post-process spatial information for and from a complex coastal three-dimensional hydrodynamic sediment and heavy metal transport numerical model. They developed a user-friendly interface to generate input files for the numerical model, and they incorporated functionality to process 3D results and convert point time series into raster time series. Zerger and Wealands (2004) presented an integration of GIS and numerical model results to support stakeholders' decision-making based on static coastal flood risk maps. They used digital look-up maps, which were the result of pre-processing a set of storms, and stored the resulting surges in a raster database. They also reported the difficulty of managing the large amounts of information involved. Irby et al. (2009) used hurricane computational model results and GoogleEarth to develop visualization techniques to help raise public awareness of hurricane storm surge risk. Commercial software packages are also available to pre-and post-process hurricane computational models files and help visualize the model results (e.g., SMS [Aquaveo 2012]). There are many numerical models that simulate hurricane storm surges. The ADCIRC model (Luettich and Westerink 2004), the Sea, Lake, and Overland Surge from Hurricane model (SLOSH) (Jelesnianski et al. 1992), the fully non-linear Finite Volume Coastal Ocean Model (FVCOM) (Chen et al. 2003), the Eulerian-Lagrangian CIRCulation (ELCIRC) model (Zhang et al. 2004) and the SWAN+ADCIRC coupled surge and wave model (Dietrich et al. 2011) are examples of such models. The framework presented here has been developed to work specifically with the SWAN+ADCIRC model; however, this framework may be readily modified to work with other computational models. The selection of the SWAN+ADCIRC model responds to the recommendation of the National Research Council's Committee on the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Flood Maps for using coupled 2-D surge and wave models to calculate base flood elevations (BFEs) to decrease the uncertainty in determining water levels for coastal flooded areas (National Research Council 2009). The SWAN+ADCIRC modeling framework has been successfully applied nationwide for storm surge studies in a number of locations (e.g., Ratcliff and Smith 2011;and Dietrich et al. 2011). The ADCIRC model (Luettich and Westerink 2004) is a physically based, finiteelement, shallow-water model that solves for water levels and currents at a range of scales. The SWAN model is a third-generation spectral wave model that computes random, short crested wind-generated waves, and wave transformation in nearshore and inland waters (Booij et al. 1999). For storm surge modeling, the 2-Dimensional Depth Integrated version of ADCIRC is typically used; this version solves the vertically integrated mass (Eq. 2.1) and the momentum (Eq. 2.2) equations, which are where h is the water depth, t is the time, \u03b6 is the surge elevation above mean sea-level, \uf075\uf072 U is the depth-averaged horizontal velocity vector, p is the barometric pressure, f is the Coriolis force, k is a vertical unit vector, \u03c4 s is the free-surface shear stress, \u03c4 b is the bottom shear stress, \u03c4 w is the wave radiation stress, and \u03c1 is the water density. For wave modeling, the spectral wave model SWAN uses the following equation (Eq. 2.3) where N is the wave action density spectrum , C g is the wave group velocity, C s is the propagation velocity, s is the relative frequency, \u03b8 is the wave direction, C \u03b8 is the wave propagation velocity, S tot is the wave growth caused by the wind, and C is the current velocity. A more detailed discussion of the governing equations used in ADCIRC and SWAN can be found in Luettich and Westerink (2004) and Booij et al. (1999), respectively. For storm surge simulation, ADCIRC is forced by the wind and pressure fields and the wave radiation stress resulting from the wave model. Tides and river inflow can also be added as boundary conditions. SWAN, in turn, is forced by the wind field and uses the water elevations from the surge model as input to define wave characteristics. The coupled SWAN+ADCIRC model (Dietrich et al. 2011) uses the same unstructured mesh of finite elements for both the wave and hydrodynamic models. In this study we will consider the SWAN+ADCIRC input and output files presented in Table 2.1.  (Maidment 2002). In a geodatamodel, the modeler can additionally embed meaning to GIS features, incorporating systems states, properties and behaviors for a specific application (Glennon 2010). Examples of geodatamodels for water resources and marine sciences are Arc Hydro (Maidment 2002) and Arc Marine (Wright et al. 2007), respectively. The Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI) has also developed thematic geodatamodels for different types of applications (ESRI 2012a). According to Goodchild (2005), the coupling of numerical models with GIS can be done in three ways: (1) embedded, in which the model is entirely within the GIS system; (2) closely coupled, in which both the GIS and the model read from and write to the same files; and (3) loosely integrated, in which the model runs separately from the GIS and the communication is done via input and output files. In the first two cases, numerical models specifically developed to work with GIS are needed; in the third case, GIS is used to pre-and post-process information but requires the development of specific code to ensure an efficient communication channel. To the best of our knowledge, there is no application that integrates the SWAN+ADCIRC with GIS for hurricane storm surge modeling. Arc StormSurge is a loosely integrated approach that allows the use of the already established storm surge model SWAN+ADCIRC and GIS to pre-and post-process the spatial information."}, {"section_title": "ARC STORMSURGE DATA MODEL", "text": "Arc StormSurge includes a data model, in geodatabase format, specifically designed to store the spatial information needed for ADCIRC and SWAN.

The {RecordingPoints} feature dataset stores the location of the points for which model results, such as water levels, current velocities, wave characteristics, wind velocities, and barometric pressures, are recorded (which, in the following will be called recording points). The {FloodMap} feature dataset stores the extent of flooded areas, as well as the delineation of areas based on any user defined parameter and threshold (e.g., areas defined by waves higher and lower than 1 m, respectively [National Research Council 2009]). {FloodMap} also includes cross sections for which flood levels and wave heights can be visualized.

The {ModelResults} table set stores time series generated by the computational model including depth-averaged current velocities, water levels and depths, wind and pressure, and wave characteristics (i.e., direction, height and period) at the mesh nodes and recording points. The {ModelMax} table set is similar to the previous table set, but it stores maximum values, rather than complete time series, at both mesh nodes and the recording points. The geodatamodel includes four raster catalogs (i.e., grids of time series) and twelve grids. The four raster catalogs store interpolated values of the water elevation, water depth, wave height and wave period over time. Four of the grids store maximum water elevation, maximum water depth, maximum wave height and period from the corresponding catalogs. Other grids store the mesh resolution and friction parameters (i.e., Manning's n, surface canopy factor and wind direction reduction factor). Additionally, ground elevation and land cover grids are stored in the geodatamodel. The geodatamodel also includes seven relationship classes that relate tables to feature classes in feature datasets. These relationship classes relate wind and pressure data in {ModelInput} to the weather stations in {Atmospheric}, and water elevation, current velocity, wave characteristics (i.e., height, direction and period) and tide data in {ModelInput} to the gauge stations in {Coastal}.

The use of numerical methods to model this phenomenon is of utmost importance for predicting and simulating storm surges, as historical data on surges is limited in both the number of storms and the number of locations to support reliable statistical predictions."}, {"section_title": "SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS", "text": "Many studies investigated storm surges using this physically-based numerical models (Irish et al. 2005;Mattocks and Forbes 2008;Rego and Li 2010;Westerink et al. 2008;Ebersole et al. 2010;Xu et al. 2010;Chen et al. 2007;Huang et al. 2010;Dietrich et al. 2010;Bunya et al. 2010;Dietrich et al. 2011). Among other variables, we expect that land cover plays an important role in the forcing and dissipation mechanisms of storm surge in coastal bays (Westerink et al. 2008). A methodology for extracting friction parameters from land cover datasets is presented by Atkinson et al. (2011). Recent studies discussed how land cover information can be incorporated in hurricane storm surge modeling and, more specifically, how land cover type data can be mapped into georeferenced friction parameters (Westerink et al. 2008;Wamsley et al. 2009;Bunya et al. 2010;Dietrich et al. 2011). The impact of land cover changes (i.e., wetlands loss due to sea-level rise) on hurricane storm surge modeling has also been investigated (Wamsley et al. 2009;Smith et al. 2010;Loder et al. 2009;Wamsley et al. 2010). A better understanding of uncertainty in estimating hurricane surge flooding from numerical analyses is crucial for determining more realistic confidence intervals on storm surges used for forecasting, planning and design efforts along the coast. (Resio et al., in review, 2012) demonstrated the importance of quantifying uncertainty for design applications, showing that surge results could be underestimated by up to one m for the New Orleans area, considering annual exceedance probabilities in the 0.01 to 0.05 range. Cardone and Cox (2012) studied uncertainties in the surge response due to different wind field models. Among the many sources of uncertainty (e.g., uncertainty in terrain characteristics and bathymetry, meteorological conditions, and model errors), in this paper, we investigate the influence of land cover specification on hurricane storm surge response and quantify the uncertainty generated by different land cover datasets. The study area includes the coastal bays and estuaries in the Corpus Christi area. We also compared the simulated surge using different land cover datasets to measured data from Hurricane Bret.\nLand cover plays an important role in hurricane surge numerical modeling because of its impacts on the forcing and dissipation mechanisms of storm surge. Here we investigated the surge response in coastal bays from different land cover datasets (C-CAP [1996(C-CAP [ , 2001(C-CAP [ and 2006, NLCD [1992, 2001 and 2006] and NWI [2011]) for a set of hypothetical storm meteorological conditions. We found significant differences in the mean maximum surges when comparing all the datasets available for the region. The differences in land cover change over time captured by the C-CAP (1996-2006) dataset did not produce any significant difference on the mean maximum surge response. On the contrary, when considering the NLCD dataset, we found significant changes in the mean maximum surge over the time period of the dataset (1992)(1993)(1994)(1995)(1996)(1997)(1998)(1999)(2000)(2001)(2002)(2003)(2004)(2005)(2006). When comparing the most recent datasets from the C-CAP, NLCD and NWI datasets, we also found significantly different mean maximum surges. In contrast to the response in coastal bays, the land cover does not have a significant impact on the surge response for the locations along the open coast and Aransas Pass. A case study considering Hurricane Bret demonstrated that there is no bias towards any dataset, and comparison with measured data resulted in a RMSE in the order of 0.10 m. The NLCD dataset for 2001 resulted in the lowest RMSE when compared to observations made during Hurricane Bret, which is in alignment with the nearly coincident times between the hurricane landfall (1999) and the dataset coverage (2001). This demonstrates the importance of having correct land cover representation for a given historical hurricane event for the case of accurate reconstruction of the historical surge. Although the NWI dataset has been updated from 1993 to 2011, it presented the second lowest RMSE. We attribute its lower RMSE to the higher accuracy of wetlands and coastal vegetation mapping. The uncertainty in the surge response was quantified with an overall mean value of 0.11 m and a standard deviation of 0.12 m. We also found that the uncertainty is strongly correlated to the meteorological conditions. The higher uncertainties were found with the lowest central pressure storms, followed by the fast moving storms; Very low uncertainties were associated with the slow moving and weak storms. Location also played an important role in the uncertainty range, with sub regions such as behind the barrier islands (with higher density of wetlands vegetation) having residuals as high as 1.00 m. Residuals greater than 0.50 m were also found in the Intercoastal Waterway, Corpus Christi Bay, Copano Bay and San Antonio Bay. The higher residuals were always on the right hand side of the storm, with residuals never greater than 0.20 m at locations distant over 100 km from the storm eye. In this study, we demonstrate the impacts of land cover datasets selection on the surge response for coastal bays. We quantified the uncertainties expected for a set of meteorological conditions and locations. We concluded that on average, we can expect at least 0.1 m of uncertainties due to land cover, with values rising up to 1 m in selected location under certain storm conditions. These uncertainty ranges, among other sources of uncertainty (e.g., wind model, bathymetry, meteorology), can be used to provide guidance on estimating confidence intervals for hurricane storm surge design and planning. The uncertainty dependence on storm intensity is particularly important when considering the expected hurricane intensification with climate change and when considering storm probabilities or return periods. Although the magnitude of our results is strongly related to our study location (i.e., land cover datasets variations, topography, meteorological conditions), we believe that the overall findings are transferable to other coastal bays. A careful analysis of different land cover datasets prior to carrying out storm surge simulations might lead to a better understanding of the consequent uncertainty from dataset selection. This is especially important in areas without sufficient recorded historical data to model validation.\nWe analyzed the impacts of SLR on hurricane storm surge, building damage, population and businesses affected for coastal bays located on the Texas central coast. To evaluate the effects of SLR on surge elevation, we considered the impact of changes in land cover as well as changes in bay geometry caused by SLR. The effects of land cover change due to SLR were quantified by the changes in the frictional drag at the sea bottom and the changes in momentum transfer from the wind to the water column caused by vegetation losses. First, we evaluated the impacts of land cover changes due to SLR on the surge response. Second, we evaluated the impacts of neglecting land cover changes due to SLR on the surge response. Finally, we evaluated the overall effect of SLR on the mean maximum surge and the consequent extent of the flooded areas. The importance of considering the effects of wetland losses due to SLR on hurricane surge was quantified by the increase in the expected damages to buildings, population and business affected. Understanding the effects of SLR on hurricane storm surge is crucial to correctly incorporate future climate variability in coastal design, planning and management. In this study, we showed that the mean maximum surge increases with SLR in addition to The methodology presented here can be easily applied to other coastal locations. Although the values and relationship presented are strongly related to local environment characteristics, it demonstrates the importance of incorporating land cover changes when simulating storm surges under climate changes. Also, a more sophisticated ecosystem model could be applied to better represent the effects of SLR on coastal vegetation and therefore leading to a more realistic future storm surge prediction. representing land cover in the US.

ADCIRC is a finite-element, shallow-water model that solves for water levels and current velocities at a range of scales, and is widely used for storm surge modeling (e.g., Irish et al. 2005;Westerink et al. 2008;Ebersole et al. 2010;Dietrich et al. 2010, and Dietrich et al. 2011. We used the two dimensional depth integrated version of ADCIRC that solves the vertically integrated mass (Eq. 3.1) and the momentum equations (Eq. 3.2). where h is the water depth, t is the time, \u03b6 is the surge elevation above mean sea-level, \uf075\uf072 U is the depth-averaged horizontal velocity vector, p is the barometric pressure, f is the Coriolis force, k is a vertical unit vector, \u03c4 s is the free-surface shear stress, \u03c4 b is the bottom shear stress and \u03c1 is the water density. We used a steady-state dynamical model, the TC96 developed by Thompson and Cardone (1996), to create the wind and pressure fields. The model computes wind stress, average wind speed and direction inside the Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL). The model assumes that the tropical cyclone structure changes slowly; thus, it can be represented using snapshots (e.g., 6 hours intervals) of its meteorological conditions: hurricane central pressure, radius of maximum speeds, storm track, Holland B parameter, and storm forward speed. The wind and pressure fields were generated every 15 min and interpolated between each snapshot. The model is based on the equation of horizontal momentum, vertically averaged through the depth of the PBL (Thompson and Cardone 1996) (Eq. 3.3): \uf075\uf075\uf072 is the geostrophic velocity vector at the low center,V \uf075\uf072 is the averaged horizontal velocity vector, air \uf072 is the air density, C p is the pressure representing the tropical cyclone, c V \uf075\uf075 \uf072 is the velocity vector of the moving reference system, D C is the drag coefficient, and H is the depth of the PBL layer. A more detailed description of the TC96 model can be found at Thompson and Cardone (1996). The numerical simulations were carried out using a validated computational mesh (Dietrich et al. 2011) for the State of Texas. This mesh contains approximately three million nodes with resolution up to 50 m in the study area and 2 km in the Atlantic Ocean. The tides were neglected due to their small amplitude (e.g., 0.17 m at NOAA station Port Ingleside in Corpus Christi Bay [NOAA 2012d]). The river inflows and wave setup were also neglected to simplify the analysis. We reviewed the historical hurricane record (NOAA 2012c) and identified Hurricanes Bret (1999), Beulah (1967), Allen (1980) and Carla (1961) as indicative of typical hurricane meteorological conditions for the study area. Based on these storms, we selected key meteorological hurricane parameters (central pressure, forward speed and radius to maximum wind). The TC96 steady-state dynamical model, developed by Thompson and Cardone (1996), was used to develop nine hypothetical storms based on historical parameters. The hypothetical storms represent three landfall locations ( Figure   3.2), considering two maximum forward speeds (11.11 and 37.04 km/h), two maximum lower central pressure (930 and 960 mb) and one hurricane radius to maximum winds (31.48 km) (Table 3.1).

We considered the ADCIRC bottom friction formulation that uses Manning's n to represent the surface roughness of different land cover types. We adopted the following non-linear quadratic formulation for calculating where C f is the friction coefficient, g is the gravitational constant; and n is the Manning's n roughness coefficient. The friction coefficient is incorporated into the bottom shear stress formulation by (Eq. 3.5): The changes in the momentum transferred by the wind to the water column are accounted for in ADCIRC in two ways: 1) Negligible penetration of momentum from the wind to the water column due to dense and high canopy vegetated areas and due to the built environment. To account for this effect, ADCIRC includes a Surface Canopy parameter, which modifies the free-surface shear stress term, \u03c4 s , in the momentum equation (Eq. 3.2). The free-surface shear stress term can be represented by (Eq. 3.6): The Surface Canopy parameter is set to zero in areas where the momentum transfer is blocked, resulting in zero wind shear stress (\u03c4 s ) at the nodes within these areas, and is set to one elsewhere. 2) Land cover also affects the wind speed due to increased frictional resistance to the air. To account for land cover effects on the wind speed, the full marine wind speed (V) calculated by the TC96 model is replaced by a reduced wind speed (V land ) over the land (Eq. 3.7): where the ratio of the full marine wind velocity and the wind velocity over the land can be represented by (Eq. 3.8): where Z marine and Z o are the marine and land roughness length parameters, which are defined by the HAZUS software program (Federal Emergency Management Agency 2012) for each land cover type."}, {"section_title": "Georeferenced parameters", "text": "The Manning's n, surface canopy and the Z o parameters values are specified based on the land cover type.

This result was expected as for all simulations there is no land cover changes off shore. All simulations underestimated the peak surge by 0.20 m at the open coast station (Bob Hall Pier). In the Naval Air Station, all the datasets underestimated the peak surge. The C-CAP datasets and the NLCD 2001 and the NWI were 0.10 m below the recorded value. The other datasets were only 0.05 m below the recorded value. In Rockport, the NLCD 2006 and 1992 were only 0.50 m below the recorded value and the other datasets were approximately 0.10 m below the recorded value. In Port Aransas, the peak surges were overestimated by approximately 0.10 m by all the datasets. In Ingleside, the NWI and the C-CAP matched exactly the measured value. The other datasets were at most 0.05 m off. In South Bird Island all the simulations overestimated the peak by approximately 0.10 to 0.15 m. A root mean square error (RMSE) of around 0.1 m was registered for almost all simulations. In Figure 3.4, a scatter plot comparing the measured and simulated peak surges at each station is presented. The lowest RMSE was found with the NLCD 2001 dataset (RMSE=0.0848), which also presented the lowest mean surges in the study regions. As Hurricane Bret made landfall in 1999, the time period of this dataset is the closest to the hurricane landfall date, demonstrating the importance of correctly representing land cover for storm surge modeling. The NWI dataset resulted in the second lowest error (RMSE=0.0956), which we attribute to the higher resolution defining wetlands and other coastal vegetation. We could not identify a trend towards a positive or negative bias when using any particular land cover dataset.

Immediately behind the barrier island, the stations registered significantly different mean surges for all the lower pressure storms and also for the western (track C) fast moving storms.

The overall mean surge residual calculated using (Eq. and s=0.18m; C-37-930: \u00b5=0.18m and s=0.17m) with values much higher than the overall average.

From these analyses, we concluded that the lower pressure storms yielded surge residuals on the order of 0.2 m; the high pressure, fast moving storms yielded surge residuals on the order of 0.1 m; and the slow moving and high pressure storms, residuals on the order of 0.05 m.  Although the storm track did not significantly impact the mean maximum surge for the entire study area, the proximity to the storm eye had an impact on the mean maximum surges for the study sub-regions. The highest surge residuals always occurred close to the hurricane eye, with residuals greater than 0.5 m always located within 100 km of the hurricane eye. The greater residuals were located on the right side of the storms, whew highest wind surge typically occurs. Locations in a distance greater than 200 km from the storm eye did not present residuals greater than 0.2 m for any storm condition. Locations on the left hand side of the storm track also did not present residuals greater than 0.2 m for any storm condition. In summary, we found that for every simulation, the greater residuals were within 100 km distance from the right hand side of the storm track (Figure 3.10). Considering the residuals spatial variation, the sub regions with higher sensitivity to land cover changes (surge anomalies > 0.5 m) were the Intercoastal Waterway, areas immediately behind the barrier islands, Corpus Christi Bay, Copano Bay and San Antonio Bay (Figure 3.11).   The highest residuals occurred in the sub region behind the barrier island, mostly due to the wide presence of wetlands (mapped differently in the different land cover datasets); these residuals reached values up to 1 m in the stronger storms. Although the Intercoastal Waterway sub region had an overall low mean residual, it presented a large variance and a strong presence of outliers (up to 1 m at selected recording points). Nueces Bay presented residuals larger than Corpus Christi Bay for weaker storms but Corpus Christi Bay had larger residuals for stronger storms. Corpus Christi Bay is more sensitive to the storm intensity as it has a larger surface area than Nueces Bay. Also, larger residuals were found on the northeastern side of the bays when the storm track was located south of the bays. This trend is inverted to the southwest when the storm track was north of the bays. This can be explained by the change on the predominant wind direction, indicating that the residuals increase towards the wind direction inside the bays. The residuals at Oso Bay were always below 0.3 m indicating a low sensitivity to land cover in this area with respect to the neighboring bays (Corpus Christi and Nueces). We believe that the low sensitivity at Oso Bay is related to its relative small surface area, which does not allow for locally generated surge."}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER IV", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "EFFECTS OF SEA-LEVEL RISE ON HURRICANE STORM SURGE AND DAMAGE IN COASTAL BAYS INTRODUCTION", "text": "Hurricanes are one of the most costly natural disasters impacting US coastal areas (Lott and Ross 2006). Recent studies point towards an increase in damages caused by hurricanes most likely because climate change, which combining sea-level rise (SLR), the predicted hurricane intensification due to a warmer climate (Knutson et al. 2010;Elsner et al. 2008), and increasing coastal populations (Emanuel 2005) could double the global financial losses from hurricanes by 2100 (Hallegatte 2012 andMendelsohn et al. 2012). One of the most important factors of climate change that will impact coastal areas is the SLR, which in recent decades has a rate over 3 mm/year globally (Church et al. 2008). Thus, hurricane storm surge risk is expected to increase under climate change (Lin et al. 2012); therefore, it is critical to fully understand the effects of SLR on hurricane storm surge. Many authors have investigated the vulnerability of hurricane prone coastal areas to the effects of SLR (Park et al. 2011;Frazier et al. 2010;Wu et al. 2002;Bjarnadottir et al. 2011), the future risks and impacts caused by SLR on storm surge inundation (Cooper et al. 2008 andShepard et al. 2012), and the impact of SLR on extreme value statistics for peak surges during storm events (Warner and Tissot 2012;and Hunter 2010). The current approach to incorporate the effects of SLR on hurricane flooding is to linearly add a given SLR amount to the results of hurricane storm surge simulations or present day statistics. However, Resio and Westerink (2008) demonstrate that the storm surge is also strongly dependent on water depth and shelf width, as well as forcing and dissipation mechanisms. Although Lin et al. (2012) recognized the existence of non-linear effects of SLR on storm surge, they reported an insignificant effect of SLR on storm surge simulations for New York City. Smith et al. (2010) reported that the storm surges increased from 1 to 3 m in addition to SLR in wetland areas in southeast Louisiana. They also reported surge increases of double or triple the relative SLR over broad areas and as much as five times in others, warning of the risk of underestimating flood levels due to the non-linear nature of both surge generation and propagation and of wave breaking. Ratcliff and Smith (2011) reported significant storm surge variances due to the effects of SLR in numerical simulations for Chesapeake Bay, more specifically in marsh areas and locations protected by surrounding topography. Mousavi et al. (2011) found that although the effects of SLR on storm surge variance was negligible along the coast, they reported changes in the surge response inside coastal bays. Besides geometrical changes in coastal bays (i.e., deeper water depth and larger surface area), SLR is also expected to have substantial impacts on the patterns and process of coastal wetlands (Michener et al. 1995); therefore, affecting surge generation and propagation inside the bays. The impact of climate change and subsequent SLR on wetlands and coastal marshes has been investigated by Chu-Agor et al. (2011), Craft et al. (2009) and Galbraith et al. (2002). More specifically, Smith et al. (2010) investigated the impact of SLR on hurricane storm surges along the coast of Louisiana, incorporating the associated wetlands change. The objective of this study is to quantify the effect of SLR on hurricane storm surge and damage in coastal bays. We are particularly interested in quantifying the impacts due to land cover changes caused by SLR on the mean maximum surge, its geospatial anomalies, inundation extent, and consequent buildings damage estimation, population and businesses affected."}, {"section_title": "METHODOLOGY", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study area", "text": "This study focuses on Texas central bays, including Matagorda Bay, Lavaca Bay, San Antonio Bay, Copano Bay, Corpus Christi Bay, Oso Bay and Baffin Bay (Figure 4  We analyzed the impacts of SLR on the surge response due to changes in land cover caused by SLR, as well as the overall impact of SLR on the surge response in coastal bays.

Our mesh has 1.3 million nodes and 2.5 million elements with resolution up to thirty meters in the study area and two kilometers in the Atlantic Ocean. The areas surrounding the Texas central bays were defined by using the high resolution information from the validated mesh. The new mesh was validated in several locations with a R 2 of 0.96 when compared to the original mesh (Chapter 2). The tide was neglected due to its small amplitude in the study area (e.g., 0.17 m at NOAA station Port Ingleside in Corpus Christi Bay), and the river inflows were also neglected to simplify the analyses.

The TC96 steady-state dynamical model, developed by Thompson and Cardone (1996), was used to develop nine hypothetical storms based on historical parameters. The hypothetical storms represent three landfall locations ( Figure   4.3), considering two maximum forward speeds (11.11 and 37.04 km/h), two maximum lower central pressure (930 and 960 mb) and one hurricane radius to maximum winds (31.48 km) (Table 4.1). These values represent common mid-range hurricane conditions for the study area (Resio et al. 2007). The storm ID represents its track, forward speed and central pressure.

To characterize wetland types and define their spatial distribution along the coast, we used the National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2012). The NWI was developed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service from 1977 to the present, and is available at a 1:24.000 scale.

The land cover classification follows the Cowardin et al. (1979) system, which is hierarchical with five major groups, subsystems, classes and sub-classes. We used the raster format of the dataset with a resolution of approximately 30 m. The creation of the current geospatial parameters is based on the methods published by Atkinson et al. (2011); Leuttich and Westerink 2004 The effects of SLR on coastal vegetation are extremely complex and still a subject of active research (e.g., Alongi 2007).

Irish et al. (2010) discussed that, although the barrier islands in Corpus Christi Bay were able to form due to a slow SLR rate for the past 3000 to 7000 years, their future morphological response to SLR would greatly vary according to the SLR rate (e.g., SLR exceeding 0.1-0.2 m/year would cause them to break up and drown). On the other hand, with slow rates of SLR, the barrier island could became stable or migrate landward. Therefore it is extremely difficult to predict the exact response of the barrier island to SLR. To simplify the analyses, here, we considered a constant topography/bathymetry and do not include any morphological changes to the coastal morphology due to SLR. However, the shoreline is changing with SLR ( Figure 4.4) as the sea-level is rising (bathtub approach). In this simplified approach, an SLR of up to 1.0 m would not greatly affect the barrier island as it is today; however, SLRs greater than 1.0 m would significantly impact the shoreline and the barrier island. The barrier island would breach in several locations with 1.5 m of SLR and would almost be completely submerged for 2.0 m. We expect these effects to have a significant impact on the surge in the bays as the open coast surge can freely propagate inside."}, {"section_title": "Surge anomaly", "text": "Here, we define the surge as the increment of the water level above MSL caused by meteorological effects only, as described by (Eq. 4.7): where \uf07a the surge and MSL is the mean sea-level at the time of interest as defined by (Eq. 4.8).  The changes in the land cover due to vegetation drowning or migration might significantly affect the frictional drag resistance to the wind, the shielding effect that the vegetation canopy might have, and reduce the frictional drag at the sea bottom. We expect these changes to increase surges, especially in faster storms (Chapter III). The geometric changes are mostly related to a water depth changes (MSL increase with SLR) over the entire domain and an increase in the total water surface area, increasing the wind fetch. Theoretically, we expect surge to decrease with increasing water depth and expect surge to increase with increasing wind fetch (Resio and Westerink 2008) (Eq. 4.9). Thus, competing processes influence local surge generation in coastal bays as SLR. where W fetch is the wind fetch. In figure 4.6, we present a schematic of the expected changes from SLR on the surge forcing and dissipation mechanisms, and the bay geometry. The surge anomaly is calculated as follows (Eq. 4.10): where \uf06c is the surge anomaly, SLR \uf07a is the surge calculated under SLR, and MSL \uf07a is the surge calculated at MSL currentday .

These functions relate flood depths to percent damage for a given structure and are derived from post-event surveys, analyses of insurance claims, and historical flood data analyses (Nadal et al. 2010). An application for damage estimation in the U.S. is the Hazards US Multi Hazard (HAZUS-MH), developed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in 2004 (Schneider et al. 2006). Several applications of the above mentioned methods can be found in the literature (Schiller 2011;Jonkman et al. 2008;Frey et al. 2010;Brody et al. 2007;Elmer et al. 2010). Here, we quantified the impacts, of SLR and related wetland loss, on hurricane surge physical damages to buildings, population and businesses. The impacts are spatially estimated by a relationship between the depth of flooding and an inventory geodatabase. The damage evaluation was carried out programmatically using PYTHON, FORTRAN and ArcPY in a GIS framework, built upon the basic functionality of HAZUS. The hydrodynamic modeling of storm surge gives water levels for every node in the numerical mesh. The maximum surge level was extracted from the model results and converted to rasters using GIS. The water depths were calculated based on the National Elevation Dataset (USGS 2012) with a resolution of 10 m. The surges with respect to MSL from ADCIRC+SWAN were converted to the NAVD88 vertical datum and used with this reference from here on. For each storm meteorological condition and SLR scenario, a water depth raster was generated with a resolution of 10 m. According to Frey et al. (2010), the usual first floor elevation in the Corpus Christi area is 1 feet, thus we assumed the overall first floor elevation for both counties to be 1foot. The population inventory is extracted from the US Census block data (US Census Bureau 2000). The representation of population by census block units inherits uncertainties to where the population is actually located. Although analyses of population at risk to storm surge distributed at a parcel level (e.g., Shepard et al. 2012 and Frey et al. 2010) have been carried out, here, we evaluated the relative impact, thus spatial uncertainties are similar for all scenarios considered. The population is considered affected if for any given block the water depth is above the assumed first floor elevation (0.3 m). We adopted the U.S. Businesses database from Reference USA (Infogroup 2012)   The built-environment inventory was taken from the HAZUS-MH (FEMA 2012) geodatabase. We adopted the census block unit for the physical direct damage analysis. Here, we considered the following occupancy classes: single family, manufactured housing, duplex, triplex, multi-dwellings (from 5-9, 10-19, 20-49, and 50+ units), temporary lodging, institutional dormitory, nursing home. A detailed description of each occupancy class is provided by FEMA (2012). The physical direct damage analysis is based on the relationship between flood depth throughout the block and depth damage functions to compute damage to the building et al. 2006). The damage curves were selected from the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) fragility weighted curves and also from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) available with HAZUS (FEMA 2012). Within each building occupancy class, a depth-damage function is adopted according to the building type. The single family occupancy is divided into four groups: one floor (72%), two floors (23%), three or more floors (3%) and a split level (2%). These groups are further classified in those with a basement (95%) and those without a basement (5%). The multifamily occupancy is divided in two groups: those with a sub-grade (5%) and those with a grade (95%). The other occupancy classes have a unique depth-damage function. In total, we adopted 22 depth-damage functions for this study. With these functions, we calculated the percentage of expected damage per occupancy class in each block.

Although the 1.0 m SLR scenario did not significantly affect the mean Manning's n, higher SLR amounts did significantly impact the mean Manning's n. In fact, the permanent inundation of coastal vegetation in the study area resulted in a mean Manning's n reduction from 0.055 at present day to 0.040 for 2.0 m of SLR. The areas that currently provided wind shield were also affected by SLRs greater than 1.0 m, and were reduced by up to 150 km 2 for 2.0 m of SLR (Figure 4.7).

For 0.5 m of SLR the overall mean surge anomaly was almost 0.10 m, for 1.0 m of SLR the overall mean surge anomaly was almost 0.20 m, reaching up to 0.50 m for 2.0 m of SLR. The higher mean surge anomaly was almost 0.90 m for the stronger storm (B-37-930) with 2.0 m of SLR. The effects from SLR considered here led to an average surge increase of around 25% on top of the SLR.  where mmsa \uf07a is the mean maximum surge neglecting land cover changes. The type of storm condition also significantly impacted the surge increase from SLR. The most intense and faster storm (i.e., Vf: 37.04 km/h; Cp: 930 mb) generated surge increases of up to almost 1.00 m on average. The weaker, but faster storm (i.e., Vf: 37.04 km/h; Cp: 960 mb) also resulted in above average surge increases for two tracks (B and C). The surge generated by the weaker and slower storms (Vf: 11.11 km/h; Cp: 960 mb) were less sensitive to SLR and resulted in surge increases of less than 0.4 m for the highest SLR scenario considered. These results were expected as the SLR is mainly impacting the forcing mechanism directly related to wind speed and dissipation mechanism related to water velocity. Within the bays, Oso Bay presented the greater rate of increase on the mean maximum surge, with values up to 0.30 and 0.80 m for SLRs of 1.0 and 2.0 m, respectively. The influence of overtopping of the barrier islands was a significant contribution to surge in Corpus Christi, Nueces and Copano bays, where there was a variation on the mean maximum surge increase rate along the SLR intervals. On average, the mean maximum surge increase rate was also approximate 25% inside the bays (Eq. 4.11)."}, {"section_title": "Effects of sea-level rise on surge when land cover changes are considered", "text": "Here, we analyze the effects of SLR on surge when land cover changes are considered in addition to the previously calculated effects of geometry changes. Following the small rates of change of Manning's n and wind blockage by vegetation for SLR scenarios of 1.0 m or less, the mean maximum surge increased no more than 0.05 m for all storm simulations This could be considered negligible given the model uncertainties. The most significant increase in the mean maximum surge is for SLR rise between 1.0 to 1.5 m, resulting in surge increases from 0.10 to 0.27 m. In this interval, we also identified a greater reduction in Manning's n and in wind shield areas. For SLR scenarios above 1.5 m the overall mean maximum surge increase is 0.20 m. When considering 2.0 m of SLR, although the mean maximum surge did not increase significantly, for some storm conditions, the mean maximum surge considering all locations were up to 0.35 m above the initial condition (Figure 4.10). The mean maximum surge anomaly can be explained by the linear relationship presented Eq. 4.12, with a R 2 of 0.90: where mmsa \uf075 is the mean maximum surge increment from land cover changes in meters. The mean maximum surge variation is also directly related to the storm properties. The larger mean maximum surge increase occurred for the strongest and fastest storms (i.e., Vf: 37.04 km/h; Cp: 930 mb) for the three tracks considered, followed by the weak and fast storms (i.e., Vf: 37.04 km/h; Cp: 960 mb), leading to the conclusion that the storm intensity played an important role in increasing the surge anomalies. We believe this is directly related to the increased quantity of momentum transmitted to the water column in the SLR conditions. For the weakest and slowest storm (i.e., Vf: 11.11 km/h;Cp: 960 mb), the mean maximum surge variation was always lower than 0.2 m (Figure 4.11). In Figure 4.11, we can clearly observe the impact of SLR higher than 1.0 m on the surge anomaly. For every storm condition, the surge anomaly increased significantly for SLR above 1.0 m, following the land cover changes due to SLR trends showed in Figure 4.7. We found a linear relationship between the mean Manning's n reduction due to SLR (Figure 4.12) and the mean maximum surge increase due to land cover changes only. Here, we provide an equation (Eq. 4.13)  where mmsa \uf06d is the mean maximum surge anomaly in m and \u03b7 is the mean Manning's n value for the study area. "}, {"section_title": "Effects of sea-level rise on surge", "text": "The combined effects of SLR on surge considering geometry and land cover changes are presented here. The overall impacts of SLR on surge are highly dependent on storm conditions and specific locations within the study area. Figure 4.13 shows the mean surge anomaly for each recording location in the study area, considering the four SLR scenarios. The mean surge anomaly is positive and increases with SLR. The SLR scenario of 0.5 m caused a mean surge anomaly of 0.13 m, 1.0 m of SLR lead to a mean surge anomaly of 0.27 m, 1.5 m of SLR occasioned a mean surge anomaly of 0.57 m and the SLR scenario of 2 m resulted in a mean surge anomaly of 0.76 m. The standard deviation also increases for each SLR scenario from 0.18 m at 0.5 SLR to 0.49 m at 2.0 meters of SLR (Figure 4.14). These results contradict the findings of Ratcliff and Smith (2011) for Chesapeake Bay, where they found that the mean maximum surge decreased with an increase in SLR, but are in alignment with the results from Smith et al. (2010) for the Louisiana coast where they reported an increase in the mean maximum surge with SLR. We believe that local geometry similarity between our study area and the Louisiana coast, in terms of the presence of barrier islands and large areas of low lying topography contribute to this similarity. On the other hand, Chesapeake Bay is a very large water body on its own, which has a much greater average depth and only one connection to the open coast, resulting in a completely different interaction with the open coast surge that would be expected for shallower coastal bays separated from the ocean by low-lying barrier islands. Although most locations follow the general trend of a mean maximum surge increase with SLR, at some locations there is no surge increase at all, with surge anomalies very close to zero, and at some stations there is a decrease in the mean maximum surge with SLR. The number of recording locations with lower surge anomalies (< 0.2 m) decreases as SLR increases with very few at the 2 m SLR scenario. Considering the four SLR scenarios, the negative outliers were never below 0.5 m of surge decrease with SLR. Conversely, positive surge anomalies reached up to 3 m in selected locations. Most of the negative surge anomalies were in the Intercoastal Waterway, Aransas Pass and directly behind the barrier islands. All of these recording stations are still under high influence of the open coast surge and are very close to the tidal inlets. We also found small anomalies, but not negative, at specific sides of the bays, strongly related to the relative position of the bay with respect to landfall location (left side of landfall location). The larger surge anomalies are less than the largest values reported by Smith et al. (2010), with increments of up to 3.00 m for only 1.0 m of SLR, mostly due to the stronger storm considered in our study. Similar to Smith et al. (2010), we also verified significant surge increases with SLR in areas where the bottom friction (Manning's n) was significantly reduced by SLR. Although we found increases much greater than Mousavi et al. (2011), we also verified geospatial changes similar to those reported by their study: slight decreases in the surge in the west parts of bays for storms that made landfall to the west of the bays, as well as the surge anomaly increase in the east side of these bays. Our stronger storms (i.e., Cp: 930 mb) had similar forcing conditions as Mousavi et al. (2011) simulation of Hurricane Beulah (i.e., Cp: 924 mb), but with different tracks. As observed, the landfall location also plays an important role in the intensity of the surge anomalies from SLR, which could be a reason for the differences in surge anomalies ranges. Another important factor is the small range of SLR scenarios (up to 0.75 m) considered by Mousavi et al. (2011), with respect to the range of simulations we performed. In our simulations, the effects of the open coast surge are significantly felt in the bays with SLR, as the MSL rises above of the barrier island in several locations. In the Mousavi et al. (2011) study, the barrier islands were represented in their model as vertical barriers, thus natural barriers islands overtopping and overflow was not simulated. Therefore, we conclude that the SLR will also increase the impacts of the open coast surges within the bays of our study area. When analyzing the inundation extents, we found that the extent of the flooded areas increased from an average of 3,000 km 2 to 6,500 km 2 with SLR intervals of 2.0 m (Figure 4.15). For intense and faster storms (i.e., Vf: 37.04 km/h; Cp: 930 mb) the flooded extent reached areas almost up to 8,000 km 2 for SLR intervals of 2.0 m. The flooded areas caused by eustatic SLR had a significant increase with 1.5 m of SLR. When combining the land cover changes and the geometry effects, the variation of the mean maximum surge anomaly with respect to SLR for the study area, considering the entire bay system, can be explained by a linear relationship (Eq. 4.14): where the mmsa \uf06d is the overall mean maximum surge anomaly in m. This model has a R 2 of 0.97 and RMSE of 0.05 m (Figure 4.16). Note that, at this point, the meteorological conditions are grouped with each mean for a given SLR interval, considering all simulations results.  However, in this study, we also demonstrated that, although the mean maximum surge anomaly is a function of the SLR increase, it is also a function of the hurricane forward speed, hurricane central pressure and the mean Manning's n, and can be described by (Eq. 4.15): and a RMSE of 0.12 m. We assume \uf0a1 is equal to zero to simplify the analysis, but it should be noted that are other factors also affect the mean maximum surge anomaly. The fitting of this model against the simulated data is presented in Figure 4.17. Certainly a more rigorous analyses is needed to develop a robust model to predict mean surge anomalies (i.e., explore alternative statistical models, include a broader range of parameters space), but this model illustrates the predictive capacity of such analyses."}, {"section_title": "Sensitivity of the effects of land cover change due to sea-level rise on expected damages", "text": "Building damages As expected, the estimated damage increases with SLR. Although the mean expected   Considering storm C-11-960, which has meteorological conditions similar to Hurricane Beulah, but with landfall much closer to the study area, the expected damages for current MSL were around 200 million dollars, which is 40% more than the damage estimated by Frey et al. (2010) for Hurricane Beulah at current MSL ($140 million). The estimated damage for Hurricane Beulah under climate change (i.e., Cp: 924 mb) and SLR of 0.8 m simulated by Frey et al. (2010) was approximately 500 million dollars, which is very close to the results from our storm C-37-930 of approximately 480 million dollars. In this case, when the land cover effects are taken into account, the expected damage for the same scenario raises up to 540 million dollars. We calculated the mean residual from the building expected damage estimated for each storm, by comparing the expected damage when including and neglecting the land cover effects on surge. Although the residuals are minor for SLR increments of up to 0.5 m, the residuals increase significantly with SLR increments above 0.5 m (Figure 4.19). We expect this change to be related to the significant decrease in frictional resistance at the sea bottom and the increase of momentum penetration to the water column caused by the vegetation lost by a larger amount of SLR. A linear function can approximate the nonlinear damage residual with respect to SLR for our study area with an R 2 of 0.91 and RMSE of 67.48 following (Eq.4.17): 238.7 * 60.18 where building \uf057 is the expected direct damage to building residual in millions of dollars. This relationship is important for demonstrating the influence of changes in the dissipation and forcing mechanisms due to SLR on expected building damage. Note this relationship is specific to the study area topography and building types and layouts. The damage residual is strongly correlated to the storms' meteorological conditions (Figure 4.20). We found that the intensification of central pressure increased the damage residual. This effect is particularly important for studies considering the intensification of hurricanes with climate change (e.g., Knutson et al. 2010;Elsner et al. 2008). This effect is negligible for SLRs less than 0.5 m, where the damage residual was almost    Here we propose a model to estimate the relative increase in building damage due to land cover changes from SLR (Figure 4.21). In terms of percentage, the expected damage increases almost linearly with SLR, and can be described by (Eq. 4.18) with an R 2 of 0.98 and a RMSE of 2 %: where % \uf047 is the estimated building damage increase in percentage due to land cover changes. This equation represents an approximation of the underestimation of calculated damage for simulations that do not consider the changes in land cover due to SLR. We can also associate the relative damage increase to the actual mean Manning's n reduction at the sea bottom (Figure 4.22) with a linear relationship (Eq. 4.19): where % \uf047 is the estimated building damage increase in percentage due to land cover changes. This equation provides an estimate of the impact of land cover changes due to SLR quantified by changes in Manning's n to damage estimate with an R 2 of 0.94 for our study area, which can be used as a guide for other locations."}, {"section_title": "Population affected", "text": "Unlike the direct damage to buildings, when considering the population affected, the simulations with changes in the land cover by SLR and the simulations neglecting it, yielded very similar results for SLR increments up to 1.0 m.

With 1.5 to 2.0 m of SLR, there was a mean difference of approximately 5 thousand people affected, where the simulations considering land cover changes led to the higher numbers. For SLR scenarios below 1.0 m, the residual was always less than 2 thousand people, which given model uncertainties, can be considered negligible (Figure 4.23). For some storms, we verified a small negative residual which is caused by different spatial flooding extents. Note that the population affected analyses does not take into consideration the depth variation within the block, which is one of the most significant impacts of SLR on the land cover changes of hurricane storm surge.

SLR is also expected to impact the forcing and dissipation mechanisms of hurricane storm surge due to changes in land cover (mainly drowning of coastal vegetation).
