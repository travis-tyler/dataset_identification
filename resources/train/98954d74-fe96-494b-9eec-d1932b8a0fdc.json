[{"section_title": "", "text": "genetically associated with heritable cognitive and mental health traits (1-5), and it is an 3 active research area to understand the shared genetic influences in these traits (6). 4\nIndividual variations of human brain volume are usually quantified by magnetic 5 resonance imaging (MRI). In region of interest (ROI)-based analysis, whole brain MRIs 6 are processed and annotated onto many per-defined ROIs, and then regional volumetric 7 phenotypes are generated to measure the structure of brain ROIs. Family and 8 population-based studies have both shown that these volumetric phenotypes are highly 9 heritable (7-9), and common single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers collected 10 across the genome can account for a large proportion of phenotypic variation (10). A 11 highly polygenic or omnigenic (11, 12) genetic architecture has been observed, which 12\nindicates that a large number of genetic variants influence regional brain volumes and 13 their genetic contributions are widespread across the whole genome. 14 15 Several genome-wide association studies (GWAS) (3, 7, 8, (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) have been conducted 16 to identify genetic risk variants for brain volumetric phenotypes. However, except for 17 the whole brain volume and volumes of few specific ROIs (e.g., hippocampus in 18 subcortical area (3, 8, 19) ), GWAS of most brain volumetric phenotypes were 19 insufficiently powered, for which the largest sample size of discovery GWAS was less 20 than 10,000 in (7). Such GWAS sample size is much smaller than those of recent GWAS 21 of other heritable brain-related traits, such as cognitive function (20), neuroticism (21), 22 and intelligence (22) , where sample sizes ranged from 269,867 to 449,484. Given the 23 polygenic nature of brain volumes, most of the genetic risk variants may remain 24 undetected, and GWAS with larger sample size can uncover more associated variants 25 and enrich the pleiotropy and genetic co-architecture with other traits. Recently, the UK 26 Biobank (UKB, (23)) study team has collected and released MRI data for more than 27 20,000 participants. In addition, publicly available imaging genetic datasets also emerge 28 from several other independent studies, including Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental 29\nCohort (PNC, (24) ), Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI, (25)), Pediatric 30\nImaging, Neurocognition, and Genetics (PING, (26) ), and the Human Connectome 31 consequences of the significant SNPs. We calculated the pairwise genetic correlation 23 between ROI volumes and 50 brain-related complex traits by the LD score regression 24 (LDSC, (32) ). To confirm the robustness of UKB GWAS findings, we jointly analyzed the 25 UKB GWAS results with those from PNC, ADNI, PING and HCP. We developed 26 genome-wide polygenic risk scores (PRS) to assess the predictive ability of the UKB 27 GWAS results on the other four datasets. GWAS summary statistics of the UKB sample 28 and meta-analysis for the five studies have been made available to public at 29 Table 2) . TBV had the largest number of 21 significant associations, which was 3,408 at 4.9*10 -10 significance level. In addition to 22 TBV, left/right hippocampus, left/right putamen, and cerebellar vermal lobules VIII-X 23 had more than 500 significant associations. In the rest of this paper, we refer 4.9*10 -10 24 as the significance threshold for SNP-level associations unless otherwise stated. 25 26 287 independent significant SNPs had 392 significant associations with 54 ROIs 27 (Supplementary Table 3 ). Independent significant SNPs were defined as significant SNPs 28 that were independent of other significant SNPs by FUMA (Online Methods, (31)). The 29 number of associations for each ROI is displayed in Figure 1 and Supplementary Table 4 . 30 Left/right hippocampus, cerebellar vermal lobules VIII-X, left/right putamen, and 31 cerebellar vermal lobules I-V had at least 19 independent significant SNPs. Other ROIs 32 6 that had at least 10 independent significant SNPs included left/right precentral, brain 1 stem, X4th ventricle, left/right lateral ventricle, left/right cerebellum white matter, and 2 TBV. The number of independent significant associations on each chromosome is shown 3 in Supplementary Table 5 , and clearly chromosome 12 had the largest number of 4 SNP-level associations with ROI volumes (Supplementary Fig. 6 ). 5"}, {"section_title": "Significant genetic controls widely spread across most ROIs of the whole brain (mean 11", "text": "h"}, {"section_title": "6", "text": "The 392 independent significant SNP-level associations can be further characterized 7 (Online Methods) as 134 significant associations between genetic risk loci and ROI 8 volumes (Table 1, Supplementary Table 6 ).

We also compared our results with those 1 reported in (7). Elliott, Sharp (7) performed GWAS of 3,144 imaging phenotypes 2 (including brain volume phenotypes processed by FreeSurfer (38)) using the UKB phase 3 1 data (n=8,428). When both being corrected for the number of performed GWAS, 26 of 4 the 78 unique SNPs (covered 66 of the 368 significant associations) reported in (7) were 5 within LD of our independent significant SNPs (Supplementary Table 13 Table 17 ).

Due to the small sample size of these four datasets, the 27 probability of replicating significant findings in the UKB was low. Instead, we checked 28 whether the SNP effect signs were concordant in the five studies and whether the 29 p-value of top UKB SNPs decreased after meta-analysis (Online Methods). Smaller 30 p-values after meta-analysis indicates similar SNP effects in independent samples (52, 31 53) . 32\nThe joint analysis was carried out on 3,841,911 SNPs which were present in all five sets 2 of GWAS results. For the 5,940 significant associations (at 4.9*10 -10 significance level), 3 64.6% (3,839) associations had the same effect signs across the five studies, and 97.5% 4 (5,791) associations had the same effect signs in at least four studies (including UKB). 5 94.0% (1,880) of the top 2,000 significant associations had smaller p-value after 6 meta-analysis, and 92.3% (5,484) of all the 5,940 associations were enhanced. We then 7 performed meta-analysis on all the 8,944,375 UKB GWAS SNPs (SNPs were allowed to 8 be missing in the four independent datasets).

Five polygenic profiles were created 18 with p-value thresholds 1, 0.5, 0.05, 5*10 -4 and 5*10 -8 , respectively, and we examined 19 the incremental R-squared (Online Methods). The PRS can explain 1.51% of the variance 20 in total brain volume (p-value=4.42*10 -110 ) (Supplementary Table 23 ). We then used the 21 GWAS summary statistics of 19,629 UKB individuals to construct polygenic profiles on 22 subjects in PNC, HCP, PING, and ADNI. The UKB-derived PRS were all significantly 23 associated with the phenotype in all the four independent datasets, and can account for 24 1.38%-4.36% phenotypic variation (p-value range=[2.97*10 -22 , 1.44*10 -6 ]).

Our novel contributions include 1) identification of many newly associated 31 genetic variants at SNP, locus, and gene levels; 2) revealing the genetic co-architecture 32 11 of brain volume phenotypes and other brain-related complex traits; 3) validation of the 1 UKB results in independent studies; and 4) assessment of the predictive power of UKB 2 GWAS results. Significant (p-value<4.9*10 -10 ) associations were found for 54 of the 101 3\nROIs. With larger sample size, the present study replicated many known genetic variants 4 but also prioritized new ones. Compared to (7), our GWAS not only discovered more 5 genetic variants, but also enriched the degree of (statistical) pleiotropy (56) of the 6 associated genes and characterized the shared genetic influences with cognitive and 7 mental health traits. 8 9 However, the current GWAS sample size of ROI volumes (and many other brain imaging 10 phenotypes) is still far from being sufficient. The highly polygenic genetic architecture of 11 ROI volumes requires a larger number of subjects to identify many weak causal SNPs. In 12 the era of sharing GWAS summary statistics, well powered GWAS is essential for ROI 13 volumes to be linked to the genetic co-architecture atlas with other complex traits. For 14 example, a recent study of Watanabe, Stringer (56) to discover the global overview of 15 genetic co-architecture of 2,965 traits only focused on GWAS with sample size larger 16 than 50,000, with the average sample size of selected traits being 256,276. In our 17 genetic correlation analysis, we only obtained limited number of significant correlations, 18 even though many pleiotropic genes were found in association lookups. Therefore, we 19 expect that GWAS of ROI volumes with larger sample size will be available and can 20 further improve our understating of genetic overlaps underlying other traits.
