As a consequence, atmospheric moist convection can now be represented in sophisticated schemes such as global cloud-resolving models and super parameterization schemes [Grabowski, 2001; Khairoutdinov and Randall, 2001; Randall et al., 2003; Tomita and Satoh, 2004; Satoh et al., 2008 Satoh et al., , 2014 Stan et al., 2010] . However, most schemes used to represent atmospheric moist convection in climate models still require the representation of processes that control the initiation of convection. Such processes are commonly known as convective trigger functions, which specify a criterion or a set of criteria that have to be satisfied in order for parameterized convection to initiate [e.g., Chao 2013] . Hereby we will refer to the convective trigger function as a ''trigger criterion.''\nThe trigger criteria in convective parameterization schemes are important for the correct representation of the timing of the diurnal cycle of convection and precipitation in atmospheric models [Xie, 2004; Lee et al., 2007a Lee et al., , 2008 Silva and de Freitas, 2015] . It is worth mentioning that the trigger criterion is just a simple representation of a suite of real physical processes. Lee et al. [2008] performed a comprehensive analysis of the convective triggering criteria in the Simplified Arakawa-Schubert deep parameterization scheme in the NCEP Global Forecasting System (GFS) atmospheric model. They found that the first trigger criterion in the convective parameterization scheme (related to a pressure difference between the convection starting level and the convective cloud base) plays a key role in the representation of the diurnal cycle of precipitation over the Great Plains in the United States. Xie [2004] introduced a dynamic constraint in the convective trigger criterion of the Community Atmosphere Model version 2 (CAM2) and verified that it improved not only the representation of the diurnal cycle of convection but also several other important fields including surface temperature and tropical high clouds on weather and subseasonal timescales.\nAlthough the convective trigger criteria do not directly influence the nature or the intensity of convection, changes in the timing of convection modifies the accumulation of convective available potential energy (CAPE) over time. Therefore, the triggering criteria indirectly affect the environment that is used by the convective scheme, impacting the representation of atmospheric phenomena on a wide range of scales. Ma and Tan [2009] modified the convective parameterization scheme in the Mesoscale Model version 5 (MM5) by including the effect of moisture advection in the convective trigger criterion. They show that the distribution and the intensity of convective precipitation were significantly improved with the new algorithm. They also verified that the new algorithm improved tropical cyclone track simulation by about 10%. Zadra et al. [2014] verified that, by adjusting a parameter called ''trigger velocity'' in the trigger criterion of the Canadian Global Deterministic Prediction System (GDPS), they were able to reduce the false alarm rate of tropical cyclone forecasts, although the new configuration resulted in little difference in the tropical cyclone track error.\nOn intraseasonal timescales, Wang and Schlesinger [1999] studied the influence of convective parameterization in the representation of the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) simulated by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) atmospheric general circulation model. The authors found that the representation of the amplitude of the MJO was improved by including a relative humidity threshold criterion in the convective parameterizations. The inclusion of a relative humidity threshold in the parameterization scheme of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Climate Model version 3 (CCM3) improved the variability of the MJO in precipitation data [Zhang and Mu, 2005] . Lin et al. [2008] also verified that a moisture convective trigger improves the variance and the phase speed of coupled equatorial waves in the Seoul National University (SNU) atmospheric general circulation model.\nIn a recent paper, Bombardi et al. [2015, hereinafter B015] modified the convective triggering criterion in the deep convection scheme of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) atmosphereocean global coupled model (AOGCM) used for seasonal prediction, the Climate Forecast System version 2 (CFSv2) [Saha et al., 2014] . An additional criterion called the Heated Condensation Framework (HCF) [Tawfik and Dirmeyer, 2014] was added to the original trigger criterion in the Simplified Arakawa-Schubert convective scheme. This modification resulted in improvements in the CFSv2 representation of the Indian summer monsoon rainfall.\nIn this paper we present a follow-up to B015 using an updated version of the convective trigger criterion in SAS. Our hypothesis is that the CFSv2 precipitation biases can be reduced by improving the representation of convection through the improvement of the convective trigger criterion. It is worth mentioning that the initiation of convection refers only to the starting of a convective event and it is different from the continuation of convection [Chao, 2013] .\nThis study is part of the National Monsoon Mission project supported by the Ministry of Earth Sciences, Government of India. The project has the objective of improving seasonal forecasts of the Indian Monsoon. A description of the CFSv2, the methods, and the main differences between this study and B015 are given in section 2. Section 3 describes the application of the original and new triggering algorithms to sounding data. The impact of the HCF trigger on seasonal simulations is investigated in section 4. Section 5 describes the impact of the new triggering criterion on the diurnal cycle of precipitation. The effect of the HCF trigger in the representation of hurricanes is investigated in section 6.

[2010] ) and the land surface model is Noah [Ek et al., 2003 ] version 2.7.1."}, {"section_title": "Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems 10.1002/2016MS000668", "text": "The atmospheric component of CFSv2 uses the Simplified Arakawa-Schubert (SAS) convective parameterization scheme, which is a mass-flux column model. There are two SAS routines currently in use in the CFSv2, informally known as ''Old SAS'' [Pan and Wu, 1995; Hong and Pan, 1998 ] and ''New SAS'' [Han and Pan, 2011] . Han and Pan [2011] describe an updated physics package for the CFSv2 including the revised version of SAS (New SAS), along with a SAS-based parameterization of shallow cumulus, and a revised scheme for the PBL. They show that the new physics package improves the model forecast skill, decreases vector wind forecast error, and improves hurricane tracks and atmospheric heating. However, the new physics package also increased the surface temperature bias and negative wind speed bias throughout the atmosphere. Ganai et al. [2015] evaluated the performance of several combinations of shallow and deep convection in representing the Indian Summer Monsoon using the CFSv2. They verified that the best configuration for representing the monsoon is the use of the New SAS deep convection scheme without using the SAS-based shallow cumulus. We reached the same conclusion in a series of sensitivity tests (not shown). However, for the purposes of model development, we made the conscious decision of using the most physically appropriate routines instead of using the operational configuration of the CFSv2. Therefore, in this study we use the New SAS and the SAS-based shallow cumulus schemes.\nThe native triggering criteria in both New SAS and SAS-based shallow cumulus is organized as follows: First, the starting point of convection is defined as the vertical level with the maximum moist static energy. Next, the cloud base is defined as the level of free convection (LFC) derived from the atmospheric stability profile above the level of maximum moist static energy. If the pressure difference between these two levels is between 120 and 180 hPa, convection is allowed to occur [Han and Pan, 2011; Suhas and Zhang, 2014] . This initial triggering criterion provides a necessary but not sufficient condition for shallow or deep convection to occur. For instance, the SAS-based shallow cumulus trigger criteria depends on other conditions such as the boundary layer height and convection inhibition due to the presence of a dry layers below the cloud base. Likewise, the New SAS trigger criteria also depends on many other factors such as entrainment, detrainment, and cloud work function also play a role in the development of convection. Convection is triggered only if all these criteria are met. Nonetheless, the pressure difference trigger is the first criterion in a series of trigger criteria, the other criteria are not even considered if the initial criteria are not met. A detailed description of all the criteria in the convective trigger criteria in SAS can be found in Lee et al. [2008] .\nh def has been shown to accurately capture convective triggering and the atmospheric background state with respect to convection over maritime land-sea breeze initiated convection [Tawfik and Dirmeyer, 2014] , as well as responding to low-level jet and mesoscale convection systems over the United States Central Plains [Tawfik and Dirmeyer, 2014; Tawfik et al., 2015a] . Therefore, in order to initiate convection the HCF trigger requires the availability of large-scale convective instability allied with sufficient local surface heating. The HCF code can be accessed at https://github.com/abtawfik/coupling-metrics/blob/master/heated_ condensation/static/hcfcalc.f90.\nThe new trigger also has an impact on the onset dates of the rainy season over India. Figure 4 shows a comparison of the onset date of the rainy season over India between the numerical experiments and the TRMM precipitation data. The rainy season timing is calculated using a method based on Liebmann and Marengo [2001] that was further modified by Bombardi and Carvalho [2009] . The method depends only on precipitation (equation (3)):\nwhere S is the accumulated precipitation anomaly, P is the daily precipitation, and P C is the annual climatological mean. The accumulated precipitation anomalies are computed for each grid point starting from the dry season (date of the minimum in the precipitation annual cycle, t 0 ) and up to one year (n ranges from 0 to the number of data in 1 year and t n is any given day between t 0 and t 0 1 one year). The S curve will initially have negative values. Once the precipitation becomes frequent, the S curve undergoes an inflection and starts to increase. After smoothing the S curve using a 1-2-1 filter, the onset of the rainy season is defined as the date when the first derivative of the smoothed S changes from negative to positive. This method was applied to each member of the seasonal simulations separately.\nThe onset date (Day Of Year -DOY) in the observations shows the northwestward progression of the Indian Summer Monsoon starting in early May (DOY 125) in the south, to early June (DOY 155) over central India, Figure 4d indicates RMSE differences that are statistically significant at 5% level according to the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test of squared differences as described in DelSole and Tippett [2014] .\nand up to mid June (DOY 165) over northwestern India (Figure 4a ). These results are in agreement with the climatological values [e.g., Joseph et al., 1994; Fasullo and Webster, 2002] . The CTRL experiment does not realistically represent the northwestward evolution of the Indian Summer Monsoon (Figures 4b and 4e) , a problem that was also found in the first version of the CFS model [Yang et al., 2008] .\nWe find that the onset date of the rainy season is much closer to the observations in the HCFv2 than in CTRL (Figure 4c ). The onset date error in HCFv2 tends to be equal or just slightly smaller than in CTRL (Figure 4d ). However, there is a clear reduction in spatial RMSE and an increase in spatial correlation in HCFv2 in comparison to CTRL over central India (Figures 4e and 4f ). There are no clear changes among experiments in the onset of the rainy season in other monsoonal regions such as North America, West Africa, and East Asia (not shown). It is also worth mentioning that we did not find any clear change in large-scale features of monsoon evolution around the time of onset such as midtropospheric temperature gradient and vertical wind shear (not shown). Figure 5 shows the rainy season onset date forecast spread (Figure 5a ) as well as the forecast error spread (Figure 5b ) averaged over Central India for every year. HCFv2 onset date forecasts are closer to observations and show smaller amplitude than CTRL (Figure 5a ). In addition, the forecast error (Figure 5b ) tends to be smaller in HCFv2 than in CTRL.\nOur attempts to investigate the mechanisms whereby the HCF trigger changes the rainy season onset timing over India were inconclusive. The CFSv2 is an operational model, which means that the output of all state variables is instantaneous. Therefore, we could only store the 00Z value for each simulation day in the seasonal runs. That means that we would only have state variable values for 5:30 am local time over India (see Sec. 6 for a detailed evaluation of the mechanisms associated with the HCF trigger).\nFigure 6.

RMSE difference between HCFv2 and CTRL for g) amplitude and h) phase of the diurnal cycle of precipitation. We mask regions where the amplitude of the observed diurnal cycle is very weak (<0.1 mm/ 3h). The stippling in g-h indicates RMSE differences that are statistically significant at 5% level according to the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test of squared differences as described in DelSole and Tippett [2014] .\nover that region, as more events are triggered upwind of the Plains in the HCF and then treated in a column-based convective scheme, and therefore are not allowed to propagate after initiation (Figure 6h ).\nTo further assess the model's performance over the Great Plains we evaluate the experiments representation of different types of diurnal cycles, similar to those studied by Zhang and Klein [2010] . Since their work focuses on spatial scales comparable to a single grid point of the CFSv2, we focused our analysis on a larger region in the southern Great Plains [1058W-958W; 308N-408N ]. In addition, we divided the different diurnal cycles into 3 categories instead of 4:\nCase 1 -For the sake of simplicity, our first case is a combination of the first two cases studied by Zhang and Klein [2010] , ''clear skies'' and ''fair weather'' without any consideration about cloud cover. These are cases with precipitation less than 0.1 mm d 21 at all times. Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems 10.1002/2016MS000668 7e). On the other hand, nighttime deep convection is better represented by CTRL than HCFv2 (Figures 7g  and 7h) . Suggesting that the HCF trigger favors the delay of convection and, therefore, offers an advantage over CTRL for late afternoon or early evening precipitation (Case 2).\nThere were no significant differences in the representation of the phase or amplitude of the diurnal cycle of precipitation over India (not shown). In addition to the evaluation of the diurnal cycle of precipitation, we also evaluated the forecast skill and error of these short simulations, as defined by the lead-time anomaly correlation and anomaly root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) of 500hPa geopotential height. There was no clear difference in forecast skill or error between the two experiments over the extratropical Northern Hemisphere (208N-808N) or Southern Hemisphere (808S-208S) (not shown).\nrelative vorticity field (averaged over 850, 700, and 650 hPa levels and truncated at a spectral resolution of T63) with values greater than 5 3 10 26 s 21 . Only events that last more than 2 days are considered.\nThe observed tracks (as in postseason best track data set, such as IBTrACS) are identified in the CFSR using track matching with IBTrACS following Hodges et al. [2011] . Tracks match if they overlap in time by any amount (accounting for differences in lifetimes between the IBTrACS and CFSR tracks), their mean separation is less than 48 geodesic, and are the track pair with minimum mean separation. This method achieves a high rate of identification of observed tracks in the analyses, with those missing being short-lived, weak systems [see Hodges and Emerton, 2015] . Likewise, to identify the same TCs in the forecast, the forecast tracks are matched against the CFSR tracks following a similar approach. Observed storms are identified in the analysis to provide extended verification lifecycles. As a result, model TCs tend to include both earlier and later stages of a life cycle than the observed storms.\nWhen evaluating hurricane track intensity errors we compared simulations to the tracks calculated from CFSR (Figure 8 ). Location and intensity in both sets of tracks is based on lower-tropospheric vorticity. Error statistics based on this measure is shown to be consistent with more traditional verification metrics [see Hodges and Emerton, 2015] . In addition, 10 m wind speed and minimum sea level pressure (SLP) were compared against the IBTrACS (Figure 9 ) because these quantities are underestimated in the CFSR data due to the model's resolution [e.g., Manganello et al., 2012] . \nThere is no clear improvement of hurricane tracks error in HCFv2 in comparison to CTRL (Figures 8a and  8b ). On the other hand, the HCF trigger improves the representation of the intensity of hurricanes up to 5 days lead-time in terms of vorticity (Figures 8c and 8d) , 10 m wind speed (Figures 9a and 9b) , and minimum SLP (Figures 9c and 9d ).\nThe hurricane tracking gave us a unique opportunity to follow these convective systems in order to investigate the mechanisms whereby the HCF trigger improves the representation of the intensity of hurricanes. Figures 10 and 11 show the median and the median difference of azimuthally averaged fields within 108 radius from the center of the hurricanes. We calculated averages in 18 bins and considering only the period from 24 to 72 h of simulation.\nWe verify that in comparison to CTRL the HCFv2 experiment shows a more convectively unstable atmosphere (Figure 10a) , with increased moisture in the lower to middle troposphere (Figure 10b ), increased precipitation close to the storm center and decreased precipitation away from the center of the storm ( Figure  10c ), increased convective ( Figure 10d ) and low cloud cover (Figure 10e ), and increased PBL height ( Figure  10f) . The HCFv2 experiment also shows enhancements to the primary and secondary circulations: a slight increase in tangential wind in the lower troposphere (Figure 11a ) in the TC core as well as increased upward velocity near the center and increased downward velocity away from the center (Figure 11c ).\nOverall, the HCF trigger causes a reduction in the activation of the convective schemes, increasing convective instability in comparison to CTRL. This allows the PBL to moisten and grow higher, injecting more Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems 10.1002/2016MS000668 moisture into the lower to mid troposphere in HCFv2. The increase in atmospheric moisture is associated with an increase in precipitation, low and convective clouds, releasing latent heat and, consequently, increasing the hurricane intensity. These results are consistent with the findings of Zadra et al. [2014] . The trigger velocity is a constraint in the convective scheme of the GDPS. The authors reduced this parameter over the tropics, thus increasing the frequency of activation of the convective scheme. This increase in the convective activity led to a reduction of TC over prediction in terms of false alarm rate, due to a reduction of midlevel moisture, low-level convergence, and vorticity. Therefore, in CFSv2 a reduction in the frequency of convection led to the strengthening of TC intensity while in GDPS an increase in the frequency of convection led to a slight weakening of TC intensity.\nThis apparent inconsistency can be explained by the fact that although all coarse resolution models are expected to under predict TC intensity , the GDPS had a tendency to overintensify TCs in comparison to other models [Zadra et al., 2014] . For this reason, Zadra et al. [2014] argue that the reduction in TC intensity in the GDPS does not necessarily mean a deterioration of forecast skill. It simply means the model generates TCs with intensities that are more comparable to the intensity generated by other models at that horizontal resolution. Nonetheless, the mechanisms whereby TC intensity is increased in the CFSv2 and decreased in the GDPS are consistent.\nIt is worth mentioning that there have been several studies on the representation of track and intensity of TCs using the high-resolution Hurricane Weather Research and Forecasting Model (HWRF) [Gopalakrishnan et al., 2012 [Gopalakrishnan et al., , 2013 Biswas et al., 2014; Zhang and Marks, 2015] , including TC rapid intensification [Kieu et al., 2014; Chen and Gopalakrishnan, 2015] . Other factors related to the improvement of the representation of the intensity of TCs include: spatial resolution and initialization [Gopalakrishnan et al., 2012] , the choice of physical parameterizations [Ma and Tan, 2009; Gopalakrishnan et al., 2012; Biswas et al., 2014] , vertical diffusivity of both momentum and heat [Gopalakrishnan et al., 2013] , and horizontal diffusion [Zhang and Marks, 2015] .\nThe accumulation of moisture results in the increase of precipitation, low and convective clouds, releasing latent heat and, consequently, intensifying the hurricanes. This is consistent with Han and Pan [2011] regarding the fact that SAS initiates too frequently, removing cloud water from the middle troposphere through rainfall and injecting cloud water into upper troposphere by increased mixing and vertical motion.\nAlthough the HCF trigger shows some improvements in the representation of convection in the CFSv2, the model still has large precipitation biases on seasonal timescales. The CFSv2 tends to overestimate precipitation over the ocean and underestimate it over land, even at higher spatial resolution [Abhik et al., 2015] . Part of this problem is because some atmospheric processes in the shallow and deep convection schemes are treated differently over land than over the ocean. The implementation of the HCF trigger in the shallow convection scheme eliminates the discrepancy in the initiation of shallow convection between land and ocean. However, the convective trigger criteria in the deep convection scheme (SAS) are more complex than that in the shallow convection scheme. SAS uses the Cloud Work Function (CWF) to determine the strength of convection [Arakawa and Schubert, 1974; Lee et al., 2008] . The CWF is a metric of atmospheric stability and in the SAS scheme the CWF has to reach a critical value in order for convection to occur. The CWF critical value which gives the best performance in the model depends on a convective adjustment timescale [Moorthi and Suarez, 1992] that assumes different values over land and ocean and is also highly dependent on the pressure difference in the original initial trigger criterion in the SAS scheme. This relationship between the initial and the CWF criteria might be related to the fact that the New SAS improved the forecast skill and the representation of convection in the CFSv2, but it also increased the surface temperature bias in comparison to Old SAS [Han and Pan, 2011] . Sensitivity tests (not shown here) verified that the CWF critical value could be tuned to the HCF trigger (as it is adjusted to the initial trigger criterion in the operational version of the model) to improve the forecast skill over the NINO3.4 region. However, tuning the convective scheme is outside the scope of this work. Additionally, a new cloud base mass flux calculation is already being developed in the SAS routine (J. Han, personal communication, 2015) , and it is expected to eliminate the discrepancy in the CWF criterion between land and ocean in the deep convection scheme.\nSince the HCF convective trigger shows improvements in the representation of convection in the CFSv2 and considering that the HCF is physically based on the balance between large-scale and surface flux destabilization as opposed to the pressure difference triggering criterion in SAS, this method holds promise for future operational prediction systems. Therefore, from a model development perspective, the implementation of the HCF trigger might be a good option for the SAS scheme in the CFSv2, especially when combined with planned improvements in the representation of the vertical profile of cloud condensate [e.g., Hazra et al., 2016; De et al., 2015] and the role of hydrometeors [e.g., Halder et al., 2012] ."}, {"section_title": "New HCF Convective Triggering Criterion", "text": "The HCF was developed by Tawfik and Dirmeyer [2014] and further elaborated upon in Tawfik et al. [2015a,b] . The HCF was designed to represent the atmospheric background state with respect to convection using profiles of temperature and specific humidity. The HCF contains a diagnostic variable analogous to convective inhibition (CIN) but does not require the selection of an air parcel nor does it require the Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems 10.1002/2016MS000668 existence of a level of free convection. Instead the HCF returns a variable referred to as the potential temperature deficit, h def , representing the heating needed to achieve saturation at the top of a well-mixed boundary layer.\nh def is calculated by incrementally increasing the potential temperature, mimicking surface heating (see Figure 1) . This pseudo-heating results in a hypothetical planetary boundary layer (PBL) whose top is located at the level at which the new lowest level potential temperature intersects the environmental lapse rate. The specific humidity profile is then mixed downward from the new hypothetical PBL height to the surface, once again to imitate growth of a well-mixed PBL. The lowest level potential temperature is incremented until saturation occurs at the top of the hypothetical PBL. This new level is referred to as the buoyant condensation level (BCL) and the amount of surface heating required to reach the BCL is C p h def , where C p is the specific heat of dry air. h def and BCL height change only when temperature and humidity profiles evolve. Note that this construct is simply a diagnostic to discover the amount of surface heating required to achieve saturation accounting for moisture and temperature characteristics of a given profile. In this regard convection is triggered when h def decreases to zero, thus the analogy with CIN and applicability as a convective triggering criterion without assumptions about parcel selection or parcel mixing. It should be noted that the HCF is not a traditional CIN trigger, as it does not rely on parcel theory but rather on a well-mixed boundary layer diagnostic.\nRather than the diagnostic description of incremental surface heating described above, programmatically it is more efficient to calculate the mixed specific humidity q mix and saturation specific humidity, q*, for all explicit levels at each time step and then discover the level at which q* minus q mix is zero. The mixed specific humidity vertical profile is calculated by equation (1):\nwhere q mix, (z i ) is the mixed specific humidity at a model level z, q is the layer average specific humidity, and Dp is the pressure difference between the top and bottom model level interfaces. The index i refers to the level of interest, the index k refers to the layer average between two consecutive model layers, and k sfc refers to the surface level. The potential temperature corresponding to the level where q* minus q mix is zero (i.e., the saturation level) is referred to as the buoyant mixing potential temperature, h BM . h def is defined by subtracting the lowest model level potential temperature (or 2 m potential temperature, h 2m ) from h BM (equation (2)). In the CFSv2 we use 2 m virtual potential temperature h v,2m instead of h 2m to appropriately respond to buoyancy-driven motions over the ocean and wet land areas (the same trigger is used over land and ocean).\n( 2) and convection is triggered when h def 5 0.

Each suite was carried out in sets of control (CTRL) and modified trigger (HCFv2) experiments, where the HCF trigger was included in both deep and shallow cumulus parameterizations.\nSince the motivation of our project is to improve the prediction of the Indian monsoon, the first set of simulations consists of seasonal hindcasts. Four ensemble members have been generated for each set of seasonal experiments for each year from 1998 to 2010, totaling 104 seasonal members. These hindcasts were initialized at 0000UTC in the first 4 days of April (1 through 4). Seasonal runs were integrated for 7 months and data were saved with daily temporal resolution. Similar to the seasonal runs, another suite of short simulations with higher temporal resolution (3 hourly) were carried out with the purpose to evaluate the impact of the HCF trigger on the diurnal cycle of precipitation. The diurnal cycle runs were initialized in the peak of the summer Indian monsoon in mid-July (14 through 17).\nSince an important aspect of model physics for operational centers is the code's ability to represent tropical cyclones (TC), we also performed a third set of experiments focusing on hurricane events that made landfall in the Americas (Table 1) . We selected long lasting major hurricanes that made landfall in the United States and a few other interesting cases such as hurricane Catarina [Pezza, 2005] that made landfall in Brazil (Table  2) .

We use the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test [Wilks, 2006] as a metric to evaluate the statistical significance of all the results presented in this work."}, {"section_title": "Stand-alone Triggering Evaluation", "text": "Before investigating the impact of the HCF trigger in simulations, we tested the effect of the original SAS criterion and the HCF trigger on observed soundings. Both trigger criteria depend solely on the profiles of temperature and humidity. The other trigger criteria used in SAS require more information than just profiles of humidity and temperature. Therefore, the results shown in this section were obtained by turning off all the other trigger criteria in SAS. Results shown in subsequent sections were obtained with the other trigger criteria in SAS turned on.\nFigure 2 shows a comparison between the HCFv2 trigger and the original SAS trigger (pressure difference) applied to temperature and humidity profiles from radiosonde data from the Dynamics of the Madden Julian Oscillation (DYNAMO) project [Ciesielski et al., 2014] . The skill scores were calculated considering all radiosondes available for the 28 locations listed in Figure 2d . The skill of each of the trigger criteria was evaluated based on the occurrence of convection using a two by two contingency Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems 10.1002/2016MS000668\n( Figure 2c ) (a brief description of these skill scores is presented in Appendix A). This result is mainly due to the fact that the original SAS trigger initiates convection too often (Figure 2d ), resulting in a large number of false alarms.\nHowever, it is worth mentioning that these results are related to only the first trigger criterion in the several triggering criteria used in SAS, such as a critical value of the cloud work function [e.g., Lee et al., 2008] . Therefore, the SAS trigger criteria in reality would not initiate convection as often as shown in Figure 2d . Nonetheless, the over-activation of convection is a known problem in SAS and a common error in most convective parameterizations [Dai, 2006; Suhas and Zhang, 2014] ."}, {"section_title": "Seasonal Simulations", "text": "Because the CFSv2 is an American model and the objective of the Monsoon Mission Project is to improve the seasonal forecast for the Indian monsoon, we will focus our analyses mostly over the United States (U.S.) and India.

We verify a reduction of monthly precipitation error over the western U.S. (Figures 3a and 3b ) and over central India (Figures 3e and 3f ). On the other hand, the HCF trigger results in an increase of monthly precipitation error over eastern U.S. (Figures 3c and 3d ).

Therefore, the purpose of this section is to highlight the impact of the HCF trigger on the amplitude and phase of the diurnal cycle of precipitation (Diurnal Cycle runs). Since we are only interested in evaluating if the HCF trigger imposes any changes in the timing or intensity of convection, we define the diurnal cycle amplitude as simply the average of the range of the mean diurnal cycle and the phase as the local time of maximum peak precipitation in the mean diurnal cycle. A more rigorous analysis of the diurnal cycle involving the least-squares-fitted of the first (24 h) and second (12 h) harmonics can be found in Chang et al.

HCF AS A CONVECTIVE TRIGGER IN THE CFSv2", "text": "The CFSv2 underestimates the amplitude of the diurnal cycle of precipitation over land (Figures 6a, 6c , and 6e) and there are no clear differences in the amplitude of the diurnal cycle of precipitation between HCFv2 and CTRL (Figure 6g ). Even though the phase in the observations are representative only of the second half of July (Figure 6b ), these results are consistent with the findings from observational studies of summertime diurnal cycle of precipitation [Lee et al., 2007b; Kikuchi and Wang, 2008; Sahany et al., 2010; Biasutti et al., 2012] .\nThe phase is not very well represented by the CFSv2 (Figures 6b, 6d , and 6f), a common problem in climate models [e.g., Bechtold et al., 2004] . The largest phase differences between simulations and observations occur over the Great Plains in the U.S. (Figures 6b, 6d, and 6f ), which has a maximum during nighttime (Figure 6c ). The latter error is common in atmospheric models, because they do not accurately represent mesoscale convective complexes (MCS) that originate over the Rocky Mountains in early afternoon and propagate across the Great Plains over a period of several hours, which are responsible for most warm season rainfall in that region [Fritsch et al., 1986; Dirmeyer et al., 2012] . There is a remarkable difference between the phase simulated by CTRL and HCFv2 (Figures 6d and 6f) . While CTRL simulates phases with maximum during nighttime over the Central U.S. (Figure 6d ), the maximum precipitation simulated by HCFv2 falls during the afternoon (Figure 6f ).\nThe largest impact of the HCF trigger in the phase of the diurnal cycle of precipitation is observed over the western U.S. (Figure 6h ). Tawfik et al. [2015b] found that the HCF accurately identified the leeside of the Rocky Mountains as the primary triggering region. However, precipitation over the Great Plains is derived from the propagation of MCS from the lee of the Rocky Mountains toward the Great Plains. Therefore, it is not surprising that the HCF trigger did not improve the representation of the phase of the diurnal cycle Figure 7 .

Therefore, we test the impact of the HCF trigger in the representation of 24 hurricane events that made landfall (Table 2) using a higher horizontal resolution (T382; $38km) implementation of CFSv2.\nHurricane tracks are identified using a method similar to that used by Bengtsson et al.

B015 introduced the HCF trigger as an additional criterion (maintaining the original criterion) to trigger the deep convection scheme (Old SAS) in the CFSv2. B015 observed an increase of summer Indian monsoon rainfall and an improvement of the representation of the onset date of the rainy season over India as a result of the implementation of the HCF trigger. In B015 the mechanism whereby the HCF trigger improved the representation of the rainy season over India was the fact that the convective scheme was allowed to trigger more often. By allowing the convective scheme to trigger more often, there was an increase in the amount of summer precipitation over India, which resulted in a reduction of the well-known dry bias over India. In this study, however, apart from using revised convective schemes (New SAS and SAS based shallow cumulus) in the CTRL experiments, the original trigger criterion of both deep and shallow convection were completely replaced by an updated version of the HCF trigger, which uses 2 m virtual potential temperature instead of 2 m potential temperature.\nThe HCF trigger outperforms the original trigger in SAS when applied to observed tropical soundings from the DYNAMO campaign. The improvement results from a reduction in convective initiation events (in contrast to B015) alleviating the high false alarm rate found in the original SAS triggering mechanism. It is worth mentioning that the SAS trigger function is based on several criteria. In this paper we investigate the impact of changing only the initial criterion.\nOn seasonal timescales, the HCF trigger improves the summer precipitation over the western U.S. and over India, including improvements in the onset date of the rainy season over India. However, there is an increase in precipitation error over the eastern U.S. The impact of the HCF trigger on the amplitude and phase of the diurnal cycle of precipitation is small and improvements were observed mostly over regions with weak diurnal cycle amplitude.\nThe mechanisms whereby the HCF trigger improves the representation of the intensity of hurricanes seems to be due to the fact that the HCF triggers convection less often than the original criterion, the convective scheme adjusts the atmospheric profiles less frequently, leaving the atmosphere in a more convectively unstable condition. This allows the PBL to grow and to inject more moisture into the lower troposphere."}, {"section_title": "Appendix A: Forecast Skill Scores", "text": "A two by two contingency table is constructed in a way where ''a'' is the number of observed events that were correctly forecasted, ''b'' is the number events forecasted to occur but were not observed, ''c'' is the number of observed events that were not forecasted, ''d'' is the number of events that did not occur and were not forecasted, and n is total number of points (sum of a, b, c, and d). From this table, a number of forecast skill scores can be calculated. The Heidke Skill Score (HSS) is a measure of the proportion of correct forecasts that would be achieved by random forecasts that are statically independent of the observations (equation (A1)). Hence, perfect forecasts receive HSS 5 1, forecasts equivalent to the reference forecast receive HSS 5 0, and forecasts worse than the reference forecast receive negative scores [Wilks, 2006] .\nThe Equitable Threat Score (ETS) is a score that is particularly useful when the event being forecasted occurs much less frequently than its nonoccurrence (equation (A2)). The ETS ranges form 0 to 1, where perfect forecasts receive ETS 5 1 [Wilks, 2006] .\nLikewise, the Bias can be calculates as equation (A3). "}]
