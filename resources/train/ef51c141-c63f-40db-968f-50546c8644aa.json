In addition to their base-year NPSAS interview, bachelor's degree recipients in each B&B cohort (1992-93, 1999-2000, and 2007-08) completed a follow-up interview 1 year after graduating (as of 1994, 2001, and 2009). This Brief analyzes data from both base-year and first follow-up interviews. More information about data collected for these cohorts can be found at http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/b&b. In all three cohorts, cumulative debt included private loans and federal loans (Direct loans [formerly Stafford], Perkins loans, and Public Health Service loans, but not PLUS loans to parents). 1 1 In 2007-08, some 35 percent of undergraduates took out Direct loans (the primary federal loan), and 14 percent took out private loans. Among all those who borrowed, 27 percent took out both types of loans (Woo 2011). In 1994In , but not in 2001In or 2009lative debt also included loans from family and friends. 2  and 2009. This measure was used in Choy andLi (2005, 2006). By definition, it excludes students not in repayment. Researchers and analysts suggest that a monthly loan payment greater than 12 percent of monthly income is burdensome to borrowers (Baum and O'Malley 2003;Baum and Schwartz 2006;Clark 2009;Greiner 1996;Hopkins 2012). So in this study, a debt burden greater than 12 percent is considered high. When comparing changes in the rate of borrowing and the amount borrowed across cohorts, findings are broken out by key factors associated with the total price of attendance (institution control-public, private nonprofit) 3 and students' financial resources. Students' 3 The total price of attendance (tuition, room and board, and other required expenses), on average, is higher at private institutions than at public ones and highest at private nonprofit institutions (Wei 2011). financial resources are analyzed in three ways: by income combined with whether or not students were financially dependent on their parents in their graduation year; 4 by Pell Grant status; 5 and by employment status while enrolled. Student income was divided into three categories: dependent students in the lower half of income distribution, dependent students in the upper half of income distribution, and all independent students. 6 These income and dependency groups were examined separately for students who graduated from public and private nonprofit institutions, but a small sample size precluded this breakout for private forprofit institutions. 4 Independent students are age 24 or older or meet one of the following requirements: have children or other dependents, served in or are a veteran of the U.S. armed forces, or are an orphan or ward of the court. 5 Pell Grants are federal grants awarded almost exclusively to low-income undergraduates; thus, they are used as a proxy for low-income status. 6 Independent students are not divided by income level because most are low-income relative to median family income. Full borrowing rates by dependency and income level are available in Woo and Matthews (2013). When examining the relationship between debt and experiences after graduation (graduate school enrollment and moving back to live with parents), the amount that students owed was categorized into four levels of debt (lowest 25 percent, lower middle 25 percent, upper middle 25 percent, and highest 25 percent). Students who did not borrow were included as a fifth category. All comparisons of estimates were tested for statistical significance using the Student's t-statistic, and all differences cited are statistically significant at the p < .05 level. 7 7 No adjustments for multiple comparisons were made. The standard errors for the estimates can be found at http://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/pubsinfo.asp?pubid=2014011.

Likewise, the average cumulative debt (in constant 2009 dollars) from all sources increased in each successive cohort, from $15,000 to $22,400 to $24,700. \u2022 In all three cohorts, the rate of borrowing was highest among students at for-profit institutions (70 to 90 percent). \u2022 Among students at public and private nonprofit institutions, the most frequent borrowers were lower income dependent students at private nonprofit institutions (70 to 80 percent borrowed) for all three cohorts. \u2022 Proportionately fewer borrowers in the latest cohort (2009) were in repayment 1 year after graduation than were their counterparts in 1994 and 2001 (60 vs. 65 and 66 percent, respectively). \u2022 Also in 2009, a larger percentage (31 percent) of graduates in repayment faced high monthly loan payments (greater than 12 percent of their monthly income), than their counterparts in 1994 and 2001 (22 and 18 percent, respectively). \u2022 Levels of student debt were not consistently associated with students' subsequent graduate school enrollment or living arrangements with parents 1 year after graduation. 1 Among recent college graduates, how did the percentage who borrowed to pay for undergraduate education and their cumulative debt change across the three cohorts? Within cohorts, how did borrowing vary by factors related to price of attendance and student financial resources?   1992-93, 1999-2000, and 2007-     The data did not allow these conditions to be further distinguished. 9 The difference between 2009 and 2001 estimates (12 and 9 percent no longer outstanding) was not statistically significant.  1 Borrowers can be not repaying but still owe when they have a deferment, forbearance, are in a grace period, or are in default. Borrowers are eligible for deferment, the temporary cessation of loan payments, for one of the following conditions: education, economic hardship, temporary disability, parental leave, unemployment, public service, or displaced homemaker. Most borrowers who obtain deferments do so to continue their education. Forbearance is granted at the discretion of the lender.     3 Within each cohort, how did students' level of debt vary with their subsequent enrollment in graduate education and living arrangements with their parents 1 year after graduation?
