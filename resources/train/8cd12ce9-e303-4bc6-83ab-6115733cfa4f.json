Methods: Thirty-three participants from the Argentina-Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database completed a cognitive battery, the Cognitive Reserve Questionnaire (CRQ), and an Argentinian accentuation reading test (TAP-BA) as a measure of premorbid intelligence, and underwent lumbar puncture for CSF biomarker quantification. Results: The CRQ significantly correlated with TAP-BA, education, and A\u03b21-42. When considering A\u03b21-42 levels, significant differences were found in CRQ scores; higher levels of CSF A\u03b21-42 were associated with higher CRQ scores. Conclusion: Reduced A\u03b21-42 in CSF is considered as evidence of amyloid deposition in the brain. Previous results suggest that individuals with higher education, higher occupational attainment, and participation in leisure activities (cognitive reserve) have a reduced risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.

It is defined by objective evidence of cognitive impairment, subjective memory complaints, and preserved global cognition and activities of daily living. 2, 3 Although rates of conversion from MCI to AD range from 5% to 23%, many individuals diagnosed with MCI remain stable or progress to a non-AD dementia.\nsubmit your manuscript | www.dovepress.com"}, {"section_title": "Dovepress", "text": "\n"}, {"section_title": "2600", "text": "harris et al deposition of amyloid-beta in plaques while high total tau levels reflect active axonal and neuronal damage. [5] [6] [7] In other types of dementia, as well as in a subgroup of patients with MCI, less specific changes in these biomarker concentrations have been reported. [8] [9] [10] Likewise, correlations between cognitive status and amyloid burden at autopsy have not been found. This fact raises the question about a possible relationship between cognitive status, amyloid burden, and disease progression.\nOn the other hand, many studies indicate that a set of life experiences, such as educational and occupational attainment and leisure activities, is associated with reduced risk of developing dementia and with a slower rate of memory decline during normal aging. Several prospective studies reported that up to 25% of older subjects who were cognitively normal in life met full pathological criteria for AD at autopsy. 11, 12 The cognitive reserve (CR) construct has been proposed to account for the discrepancy between the degree of brain pathology and its clinical manifestation. Therefore, individuals with high CR may tolerate substantial pathology before showing cognitive loss, whereas those with low CR may decline earlier. The CR paradigm postulates that individual differences in cognitive achievement, and/or neural networks underlying task performance, allow some people to cope better than others with brain damage; according to the CR hypothesis, persons with higher CR can sustain cognitive function in the presence of more brain pathology than subjects with lower CR. 13 Stimulating environments, a component of CR measured in humans by variables such as engagement in leisure activities and occupational attainment, promote neurogenesis in animals, and upregulate brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which fosters neural plasticity.\n14 There is evidence suggesting that environmental enrichment might act directly to prevent or slow the accumulation of AD pathology. 15 Therefore, as cognitive stimulation regulates factors that increase neuronal plasticity, a complete account of CR should integrate the interactions between genetics, environmental influences on brain reserve, pathology, and the ability to actively compensate for the effects of pathology.\nRoe et al have investigated the relationship between CR, AD biomarkers, and the risk of cognitive impairment, and found that A\u03b21-42 combined with education and normalized whole brain-volume better predicts progression across follow-up. 16 The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between CR and A\u03b21-42 con centrations.

The research was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (1975) .\nCSF was collected by lumbar puncture at the L3/L4 or L4/L5 level during the morning. The first 20 drops were discarded and the remaining CSF (approximately 4-5 mL) was collected and aliquoted in polypropylene tubes. These tubes were stored at -80\u00b0C until analysis. Quantification of A\u03b21-42, total tau, and phosphorylated tau181 was performed using commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits (Innogenetics, Ghent, Belgium) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 25 \u00b5L or 75 \u00b5L of CSF samples were used for measurement of A\u03b21-42 and total tau or phosphorylated tau181, respectively. Samples were incubated in the corresponding capture antibody-coated polypropylene plate with specific biotinylated monoclonal detector antibodies. After washing, the antigen-antibody complexes were detected by peroxidase-labeled streptavidin followed by addition of tetramethyl benzidine as the peroxidase substrate. Absorbance at 450 nm and 620 nm (used as reference wavelengths) was measured using a Benchmark Plus microplate spectrophotometer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Standard curve interpolation of the data and subsequent analysis were performed using GraphPad Prism 5 software. Receiver operating characteristic analysis using a cohort of cognitively normal controls and AD patients showed that the cut-off point of 532.5 pg/mL best discriminated these two populations (sensitivity 100%, specificity 87.5%).

ADNI includes adult subjects aged 55-90 years who meet entry criteria for a clinical diagnosis of amnestic MCI, probable AD, or normal cognition. Participants receive baseline and periodic physical and neurological examinations and standardized neuropsychological assessments, and provide biological samples (blood, urine, and in a subset, CSF) throughout the study. Imaging (magnetic resonance imaging and for a subset, F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography [PET] and Pittsburgh compound B PET) is performed at baseline and at regular intervals thereafter (http://www.adni-info.org/).\nThe ADNI neuropsychological battery comprises the Spanish versions of: MMSE; 20 Logical Memory; 21 Clinical Dementia Rating; 22 The Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog); 23 Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT); 24 Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA); 25 Clock Drawing Test; 26 Category fluency-animals; 27 Trail Making Test A and B; 28 and Boston Naming Test. 29 Some of the tests selected for ADNI are: \u2022 The MMSE, a 30-point questionnaire that is widely used to screen for cognitive impairment (10 points for spatial and temporal orientation; 6 points for memory retention and recall; 5 points for attention and calculation; 8 points for language; and 1 point for visual construction).\n\u2022 The Boston Naming Test, a confrontation naming test that measures word retrieval using a set of pictures (30 items in the ADNI version).\n\u2022 Story A from the WMS-III Logical Memory (subtest of the Wechsler Memory Scale) is an immediate and delay measure of episodic memory.\n\u2022 The RAVLT, a list-learning paradigm in which the patient, after hearing a list of 15 nouns (list A) is asked to recall as many words from the list as possible (five repetitions of free-recall). An \"interference\" list (list B) is presented in the same manner, after the interference trial, the participant is immediately asked to recall the words from list A. After a 20-minute delay, the participant is asked to again recall the words from list A, followed by a recognition phase (50 words).\n\u2022 The ADAS-Cog, a brief standardized test battery that assesses learning and memory, language production, language comprehension, constructional praxis, ideational praxis, and orientation. Following the objective testing, subjective clinical ratings of language ability and the ability to remember test instructions are performed by the examiner.\n\u2022 The Clinical Dementia Rating, a global measure of dementia, which is usually completed by a clinician by means of an interview with the patient and the caregiver (covered areas are memory, orientation, judgment and problem-solving, community affairs, home and hobbies, and personal care).\n\u2022 Category fluency (animals), a widely used measure of semantic memory in which the subject is asked to name different exemplars from a given semantic category. The number of correct unique exemplars named is scored.\n\u2022 The MoCA, designed as a rapid screening instrument for mild cognitive dysfunction, assesses attention and concentration, executive functions, memory, language, visuoconstructional skills, conceptual thinking, calculations, and orientation.

With the advent of CSF biomarkers, such as tau and amyloid-beta (A\u03b21-42), measuring in vivo levels of peptides in CSF has been helpful for the diagnosis of AD. 30 Some studies have reported that these markers could reflect brain pathology and could be used as surrogates for AD lesions.\nBased on the CR theory, highly educated subjects would have more marked abnormalities in the CSF than those with a shorter education because of the compensatory effect over brain damage.

According to Stern et al AD patients with higher education exhibited a stronger brain pathology, including reduced temporoparietal PET with fluorodeoxyglucose or single photon emission computed tomography measurements, when compared with patients with AD with low educational attainment at similar levels of dementia severity. 31 The aim of the current investigation was to investigate the relationship between CR and concentrations of A\u03b21-42 in patients from our ADNI cohort. Several studies found an inverse correlation between A\u03b21-42 and CR, suggesting that subjects with high CR have greater biomarker abnormalities than subjects with low CR. Similarly, Rolstad et al observed that, at the same level of clinical severity, patients converting to dementia with high CR had lower A\u03b21-42 than converters with a medium and low CR (measured by educational level). 32 On the other hand, recent studies proposed that amyloidbeta secretion might be affected by neural activity and that enhanced lifestyle practices are associated with reduced amyloid-beta deposition (based on Pittsburgh compound B PET and CSF A\u03b21-42). [33] [34] [35] Jagust and Mormino observed that brain activity regulates amyloid-beta secretion and deposition. 11 They hypothesize that CR may play different roles during pre-amyloid and post-amyloid plaque stages: once A\u03b21-42 deposition begins, CR allows high CR individuals to cope better with neuronal dysfunction than in individuals with low CR. However, in pre-amyloid plaque stages, CR could act to diminish A\u03b21-42 production through better neural efficiency.\nOur study revealed a significant direct relationship between CSF A\u03b21-42 level and CRQ score. These results are consistent with the observation that participation in cognitively stimulating activities is associated with less accumulation of amyloid-beta.\nLiang et al examined associations between exercise engagement and biomarker levels in older adults without clinical symptoms of AD, and observed that individuals with elevated Pittsburgh compound B PET, CSF tau or phosphorylated tau181, or decreased CSF A\u03b21-42 consistently exercised less. 36 The notion that cognitive activity influences the development of AD pathology is supported by recent findings that cognitively normal older individuals with greater lifelong participation in complex mental activities showed less hippocampal atrophy, another biomarker of AD pathology. These authors reported a direct association between cognitive activity and [11C] Pittsburgh compound B uptake, suggesting that lifestyle factors found in individuals with high cognitive engagement may prevent or slow deposition of A\u03b21-42-amyloid. 35 Bennet et al using crude counts of AD pathology from the maximally involved area from four 6 \u00b5m sections stained with modified Bielschowsky silver stains, reported that education modified the relationship between senile plaques -but not neurofibrillary tangles -and level of cognition. 37 Thus, focusing on amyloid-beta as the measure of primary AD pathology is based on previous studies showing that education (cognitive reserve) reduced the impact of amyloid-beta pathology but not tau pathology on cognitive performance.\nThis preliminary result supports the hypothesis of the protective role of enhanced lifelong neural activity on amyloid deposition and the utility of biomarkers, specifically A\u03b21-42, as substitutes for pathology in relation to CR. To our knowledge, this preliminary study is the first Argentinian investigation reporting this association. A prospective analysis of cognitive decline in a larger cohort would be important in order to determine the frequency of conversion from MCI to dementia. The limitations of this paper include the small size of the sample due to the inclusion criterion requiring that patients from the ADNI protocol consent to a lumbar puncture. "}]
