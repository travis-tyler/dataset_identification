Using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data set, properties of the 11-item ADAS-cog (ADAS.11), the 13-item ADAS-cog (ADAS.All) and novel composite scores were compared, using weighting schemes derived from the Random Forests (RF) tree-based multivariate model.

The ability of the RFweighted ADAS-cog composite and individual scores, along with neuroimaging or biochemical biomarkers to predict MCI to AD conversion over 12 months was also assessed. Although originally optimized to discriminate across diagnostic categories, the ADAS.\nAll, weighted according to the RF model, did nearly as well or better than individual or composite baseline neuroimaging or CSF biomarkers in prediction of 12-month conversion from MCI to AD. These suggest that a modified subscore weighting scheme applied to the 13-item ADAS-cog is comparable to imaging or CSF markers in prediction of conversion from MCI to AD at 12 months."}, {"section_title": "T", "text": "here is burgeoning interest in the development of therapeutics for prodromal Alzheimer disease (AD). This is driven by the hypothesis that disease-modifying therapy is most likely to be efficacious in the earliest stages of the pathologic cascade of events leading to neuronal dysfunction and death. Unfortunately, clinical trials of early-stage patients who have not yet met National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Diseases and StrokeAlzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA)-defined criteria for AD 1 pose special challenges. One difficulty revolves around the most appropriate metric to assess the efficacy of therapeutic interventions in mildly affected patients. Most pharmacotherapy trials of individuals with prodromal AD have used conversion from a cognitively impaired but nondemented state (so-called mild cognitive impairment, or MCI) 2 to AD as an outcome measure because AD has an accepted clinical definition for registration and labeling purposes, and standard cognitive measures, particularly the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog), 3 are not sensitive to change at milder degrees of impairment. 4, 5 However, the low rates of conversion of MCI to AD (10% to 15%/y) 6 necessitate either enrolling very large numbers of participants, or following participants for several years to achieve sufficient power to detect a change in the rate of conversion. 7, 8 Several approaches have been used to deal with these issues. One has been to redefine AD to shift the diagnostic threshold to earlier stages of disease by removing the requirement for functional decline and including a requirement for positive biomarker findings. 9 This approach takes advantage of the impressive body of literature showing the utility of biological biomarkers as markers of the underlying disease process in AD, and potentially removes the regulatory hurdle described above, but the problems of poor scale sensitivity remain. In addition, by incorporating biomarker data, such as positive amyloid imaging or depressed levels of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid beta (Ab), this strategy makes a fundamental assumption about the relationship between drug efficacy and the biology of AD that may not be warranted. For example, participants with low CSF Ab levels may be less sensitive to antiamyloid therapy as it may be more difficult to remove deposited amyloid than to prevent its deposition. Another approach has been to use MCI to AD conversion as an outcome measure, but to \"enrich\" MCI patient pools by using either cognitive or biomarker data to enroll participants that have a higher likelihood of converting from MCI to AD in a short period of time. The major advantage of this approach compared with the first is that it retains the current regulatory taxonomy and the primacy of functional decline as the outcome measure.\nThe success of any biomarker-based enrichment scheme depends on the appropriateness and practical applicability of candidate markers. The ideal marker should not only predict short-term conversion from MCI to AD with a high degree of accuracy, but should be suitable for screening a large population to recruit an adequate number of participants. Certain markers, such as 11 C-PIB binding, are not widely available, and many imaging modalities are prohibitively expensive to apply across hundreds of potential participants. In addition, some markers, such as loss of hippocampal volume or deposition of amyloid, should be viewed with caution, as they may reflect a state of disease that is too advanced to allow many therapeutic approaches to show efficacy.\nIn this report, we use data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, which is ideally suited to compare multiple potential markers of disease progression in a population of MCI patients, to develop a tractable strategy to predict over a short period of time (12 mo) the conversion from MCI to AD. Specifically, we use modern forms of multivariate analysis of cognitive data to compare the ability of cognitive measures versus neuroimaging and biochemical biomarkers to predict the conversion from MCI to AD."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)", "text": "ADNI is a naturalistic, longitudinal study of AD onset and progression being conducted at 57 sites in the United States and Canada.

ADNI's aim is to develop validated surrogate markers for early detection and monitoring of disease progression, in order to inform the design and conduct of clinical trials for the development of new AD therapeutics.\nThe ADNI study was designed to follow over time approximately 200 normal elderly individuals (36 mo), 400 patients with amnestic MCI (36 mo), and 200 with AD (24 mo).

Weights for the ADAS-cog components were derived using the Random Forests (RF) tree-based algorithm 12, 13 that compared the 3 diagnostic categories (AD, MCI, and Normal). In this algorithm, 10,000 bootstrap datasets of the same size as the original data are drawn randomly by sampling with replacement. In this sampling process, some samples get repeated multiple times, and approximately one-third of the original data get left out; these left-out data corresponding to each bootstrap dataset are referred as the Out-Of-Bag (OOB) datasets. Classification Trees are grown to the maximum possible depth for each of the 10,000 bootstrap datasets. At each tree node, only a small random subset of the ADAS-cog components is used to split that node. Predictions of the diagnostic categories for each sample in the omitted OOB datasets are then made using majority vote from the 10,000 Trees. The predictive accuracy of this RF model on all the ADAS-cog components is then obtained by comparing the predictions with the true diagnosis of the OOB samples.\nThe weight for each ADAS-cog component was derived as follows. First, each component was replaced by noise, one at a time. The RF model was then fit on this noise component and the remaining ADAS-cog components using the algorithm described above. The predictive accuracy of the OOB samples was then derived and compared with the predictive accuracy determined from the RF model on all ADAS-cog components. The resulting drop in predictive accuracy became the importance score and this became the \"weight\" for the component that was replaced by noise. This was repeated for each ADAS-cog component, resulting in weights for all the components. These weights were then used to calculate a weighted average of all the 13 components. The resultant new ADAS-cog composite is referred to as ADAS.Tree.\nThe significance of the ADAS-cog components and composites between the three diagnostic categories (AD, MCI, and Normal) was assessed using a Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric test."}, {"section_title": "Evaluation of Cognitive and Imaging Markers for Prognostication of Disease Progression", "text": "We determined the prognostic performance of baseline cognitive markers (ADAS-cog components, ADAS-cog composites, MMSE), CSF amyloid/tau markers (Ab 1-42 , total tau, and phospho-tau) and imaging markers (FDG-PET and volumetric MRI) in MCI individuals to correctly identify those that progressed to AD and those that did not over a 1-year period. PIB amyloid imaging was not included in this analysis because baseline data were not available. The primary objectives of these analyses were as follows: 1. Evaluate the relative usefulness of ADAS.Tree, ADAS.All, ADAS.11, MMSE, and the individual ADAScog components to predict conversion from MCI to AD over 1 year. 2. Identify an optimal subset of markers (called \"signature\") from the ADAS-cog domain, CSF amyloid/tau domain, FDG-PET domain and the MRI domain for predicting MCI-AD progression (separately for each domain, and then in combination). This will help determine how much value is added by the baseline CSF and imaging markers over and above the performance of baseline signatures from the cognitive markers, and in particular, the relative usefulness of ADAS.Tree and ADAS.All.\nFDG-PET, volumetric MRI and CSF data were not available on all MCI patients at baseline. To enable \"apples-to-apples\" comparison, separate datasets were created for these analyses; one in which the ADAS-cog and CSF data were available in all patients (called Cog-CSF dataset), another in which the ADAS-cog and FDG-PET data were available in all patients (called Cog-PET dataset), and a third in which the ADAS-cog and MRI data were available on all patients (called Cog-MRI dataset).\nTo address objective no.1, the significance of each of the baseline cognition composites and components was determined separately using the nonparametric Wilcoxon test. This was compared with the significance of the individual CSF and imaging markers.\nTo address objective no. 2, multivariate analyses were done to determine the optimal subset of markers (called \"signature\") that best detects the progression of MCI to AD. For the Cog-PET dataset, this analysis was done separately for the cognition markers alone, FDG-PET markers alone, and the cognition and FDG-PET markers together. This was similarly repeated for the Cog-MRI dataset and Cog-CSF datasets. From all these analyses, the performance of the optimal subset of markers to predict MCI-AD progression was determined and compared. This helped determine whether the CSF and imaging markers added value over and above the cognition components and composites, and also the relative usefulness of ADAS.Tree and ADAS.All in this context.\nFor each dataset (eg, Cog-PET dataset), and for each subgroup of markers (cognition alone, FDG-PET alone, and cognition together with FDG-PET), optimal signatures were derived by first filtering out the most significant markers using a robust version of the Student t-test. The optimal signatures were derived using one of the following methods: (1) Relative importance scores from Random Forests algorithm described above, and (2) Simulated Annealing. These derived signatures were then used in one of the following classification algorithms: (1) Linear Discriminant Analysis, (2) Diagonal Linear Discriminant Analysis, (3) Diagonal Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, (4) Random Forests, (5) Support Vector Machines, (6) Neural Network, and (7) k-Nearest Neighbor method.\nThe predictive performance from these classification algorithms on the optimal signatures was evaluated using 10 iterations of a 5-fold stratified cross-validation. This was carried out by first dividing the original dataset randomly into 2 equal parts, stratified to ensure that each of these parts had the same balance between disease progressors and nonprogressors as was found in the original dataset. Then each part was left out one at a time (test-set), and the remaining four parts were used as a training set to derive the optimal signature and fit the classification model described above. The models on the training sets were then used to predict the test-sets, and the predictions from all the five test-sets were pooled together to estimate the performance measures, sensitivity (ability to correctly identify MCI-AD progression) and specificity (ability to correctly identify nonprogressors). This entire procedure was iterated 10 times to yield robust estimates of sensitivity and specificity. Such a rigorous derivation of optimal signatures is recommended also for high throughput datasets such as genomics, 14 and it provides a more accurate reflection of the true performance in a future cohort of MCI patients. For example, when the cross-validation is done only in the final model fitting step after the signatures are derived from the entire dataset, estimates of sensitivity and specificity will be significantly biased upward. 15 Therefore, performance measures reported by different publications should be compared with caution.\nThe optimal signature from the list of several signatures that were derived as described above was selected on the basis of Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), 16 sensitivity and specificity. Unlike the usual means of describing overall classification accuracy, such as area under the curve (AUC) measurements from receiveroperator curves (ROC), MCC takes into consideration the different number of participants in each class. This is appropriate for this study, as only approximately 20% of participants progressed from MCI to AD over the 12 month period. MCC values are expressed as percentages. A diagram of the dataflow for these analyses is shown in Figure 1 .\nAnalyses were done with R (http://www.R-project. org), version 2.7, and the contributed libraries for different machine learning methods used in our analyses.

In all 3 diagnostic groups, there were more men than women (52.0%, 64.5%, 52.8%, for Normal, MCI and AD, respectively), and the proportion of men was greatest in the MCI group (P=0.002, likelihood-ratio test)."}, {"section_title": "Analysis of Baseline ADAS-cog Data", "text": "We analyzed baseline ADAS-cog data (the routine subscales, ie, ADAS.11, plus delayed word recall and number cancellation, ie, ADAS.All) from 197 AD patients, 397 MCI patients and 229 elderly control individuals in the ADNI database. In the ADNI dataset, the subscales are given the labels Q1 to Q12, and Q14, and we have kept this nomenclature. Figure 2 shows the distributions of the scores of each of the subscales. All the components are highly significant (P<0.0001, Kruskal-Wallis test) in their ability to distinguish diagnostic categories. However, these box plots show an uneven capacity of the components to separate the different diagnostic categories. For example, Word Recall and Delayed Word Recall show clearly separable modal values among the 3 diagnostic categories (test statistics=359.37 and 431.57, respectively). In contrast, other tests, such as Commands and Ideational Praxis, have scores that cluster near the lowest values, suggestive of prominent ceiling effects in these populations (test statistics=48.7 and 41.85, respectively). This implies that weighting these components equally by simply summing them up to define the composite, as presently done for the traditional ADAS-cog, might not provide an optimal diagnostic for AD.\nAs described in the statistical methods section, the relative importance (rank) of each of the 13 components and composites for differentiating AD, MCI, and Normal at baseline was assessed within the framework of the Random Forests multivariate tree-based algorithm. These are plotted in Figure 3 , expressed as mean decrease in FIGURE 1. Diagram of data flow for characterization of performance of cognitive, CSF and imaging markers for prediction of MCI to AD conversion. The total pool of MCI participants was divided into partially overlapping subgroups that contain participants for which baseline ADAS-cog and candidate marker data were available.

These relative importance scores defined the weights for these components, and a weighted sum of these components was used to define a new composite: ADAS.Tree. Note that Delayed Word Recall and Number Cancellation are excluded from the usual clinical endpoint (ADAS.11), but these are among the most powerful components for differentiating AD, MCI, and Normal. Construction and Ideational Praxis do not add significant predictive value to the composite, so these received negligible weight. The weights given for the 12 components (Fig. 3) , in order from Q1 to Q12 and Q14, are 1.05, 0.38, 0, 1.17, 0.61, 0.13, 1.13, 0.41, 0.54, 0.49, 0.69, 0.39, and 0.68, respectively.

All, and ADAS.Tree composite scores was evaluated for the separation of the diagnostic categories of Normal, MCI and AD (n=229, 397 and 193 for Normal, MCI and AD respectively). All of these measures achieved highly significant (P<0.0001) separation of diagnostic categories, with the ADAS.Tree generating the numerically highest test statistic of the 4 scales (Fig. 4) . We also assessed the performance of these composite scores on a dataset separate from the training dataset. In this case, we used the 24 month data for all participants for whom such data were available (n=197, 284 and 135 for Normal, MCI and AD respectively). We again found that all of these measures were highly statistically significant (P<0.0001) and found that the test statistic was highest for ADAS.Tree (test statistics=401.1, 393.3, 378.9, and 368.8 for ADAS.Tree, ADAS.All, ADAS.11 and MMSE, respectively)."}, {"section_title": "Prediction of MCI to AD Conversion", "text": "We examined the relationship between the individual ADAS-cog subscales and the composite ADAS measures and the likelihood of conversion from MCI to AD over 12 months. The overall rate of conversion in one year was 18% (66/349).

Table 2 shows the P-values from the nonparametric (Wilcoxon) tests for each of the subscales or composite measures for differentiating MCI to AD converters versus ) were among the best of the individual subscales in predicting decline. Other subscales, such as Comprehension (P=0.961) and Ideational Praxis (P=0.756), showed no differences between converters and nonconverters. Univariate comparisons were made among the composite measures (ADAS.Tree, ADAS.All, ADAS.11, and MMSE) for the prediction of MCI-AD conversion and the ROC curves for these comparisons are shown in Figure 5 . The AUCs for prediction of MCI-AD conversion were 0.746, 0.730, 0.696 and 0.589 for the ADAS.Tree, ADAS.All, ADAS.11 and MMSE, respectively. Pairwise comparison of the ADAS.Tree to the other composites using a w 2 statistic 16 showed marginal superiority over ADAS.All (P=0.124), and that it was superior to ADAS.11 (P=0.027) and MMSE (P=0.00024).\nWe assessed the relationship between baseline ADAS. Tree and the probability of conversion from MCI to AD, which is shown in Figure 6 . Logistic regression on the relationship between ADAS.Tree and the probability of progression yields the sigmoidal function shown in Figure 6 , such that for each one unit increase on the baseline ADAS.Tree, the odds ratio for conversion from MCI to AD is 1.223 (P=2.49 \u00c210 \u00c0 9 ). Given this, and the distribution of baseline ADAS.Tree values [mean (SD)=15.98 (5.14), dotted line, Figure 6 ], one can compute the number of participants needed to screen to enroll a group of individuals with a desired rate of 12-month MCI-AD conversion.\nWe also compared the ability of individual ADAS-cog components and ADAS-cog composite measures versus individual imaging or CSF biomarker values to predict conversion from MCI to AD over 12 months. Table 3 lists the results of univariate analysis of the 3 CSF markers and the ratio of total tau and p-tau 181 to Ab 1-42. The most robust predictor of MCI-AD conversion is the ratio of P-tau 181 to Ab 1-42 (P=0.006). Table 4 lists the top 10 FDG-PET biomarkers and Table 5 lists the top 10 volumetric MRI biomarkers [for a full list of P-values for all 85 FDG-PET and 142 volumetric MRI markers, (Supplemental Table 1 http://links.lww.com/WAD/A9) and (Supplemental Table 2 http://links.lww.com/WAD/A8), respectively]. Note that the P-value of even the most highly predictive imaging marker (TEMPINFL_uas, left inferior temporal cortex) is almost 3 orders of magnitude higher than the most predictive cognitive subscale (Word Recall) and 4 orders of magnitude higher than the most predictive cognitive composite score (ADAS.Tree). Among the CSF markers, Ab 1-42 and p-tau 181 were significantly associated with conversion to AD, but these associations were several orders of magnitude less significant than the best cognitive and imaging markers.\nWe then compared the MCI to AD prediction accuracy of the ADAS.Tree to optimized composite markers from each of the three other biomarker domains: CSF, FDG-PET, and volumetric MRI. To do this, we applied machine-learning predictive modeling methods to determine the optimal subset of markers (\"signature\") that best detects the 12-month progression of MCI to AD (see statistical methods section for details).\nComparisons between the ADAS-cog and imaging or biochemical biomarkers for the prediction of MCI to AD conversion are shown in Table 6 . For the Cog-CSF dataset, the optimal signature from the CSF markers alone had 62.65% sensitivity and 54.2% specificity (MCC=13.4%). The optimal signature from the cognitive markers alone had 76.5% sensitivity and 63.9% specificity (MCC= 32.2%), and the optimal signature from the CSF and cognitive markers had 76.8% sensitivity and 63.9% specificity (MCC=32.5%). Thus, the performance of cognitive markers alone was superior to the CSF markers alone, and the addition of CSF markers to the cognitive markers did not substantially improve the predictive performance.\nFor the Cog-PET dataset, the optimal signature from the PET markers alone had 55.4% sensitivity and 85.5% specificity (MCC=36.4%). The optimal signature from the cognitive markers alone had 63.1% sensitivity and 82.2% specificity (MCC=37.8%), and the optimal signature from the PET and cognitive markers had 56.9% sensitivity and 83.7% specificity (MCC=34.7%). Thus, the performance of cognitive markers alone was quite comparable to the PET markers alone, and the addition of PET markers to the cognitive markers did not result in substantial improvement.\nFor the Cog-MRI dataset, the optimal signature from the MRI markers alone had 57.5% sensitivity and 62.3% specificity (MCC=15.6%). The optimal signature from the cognitive markers alone had 67.3% sensitivity and 67.4% specificity (MCC=27.7%), and the optimal signature from the MRI and cognitive markers had 66.6% sensitivity and 66.5% specificity (MCC=26.3%). Thus, the performance of cognitive markers alone was superior to the MRI markers alone, and the addition of MRI markers to the cognitive markers did not improve predictive performance.\nLists of the most frequently occurring cognitive and CSF, MRI, and PET markers in the signatures from 10 repetitions of 5-fold cross-validation (out of 10 \u00c25=50 signatures) are summarized in Figures 7A to C, respec- tively. ADAS.Tree plays the most prominent role among the cognition markers. ADAS.All, MMSE and some specific ADAS-cog components such as Q1 (Word Recall), Q4 (Delayed Word Recall), and Q7 (Orientation) feature fairly prominently as well. Most importantly, we continued to observe that the primary endpoint, ADAS.11, has considerably less predictive value relative to the other cognitive composites considered and also relative to some of the specific ADAS-cog components."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "Multivariate modeling using a Random Forests approach applied to the ADNI dataset showed that modified weighting of the subscales of the 13-item ADAScog (ADAS.Tree) is better able to separate the diagnostic "}, {"section_title": "Alzheimer Dis Assoc Disord", "text": "Prediction of Conversion from MCI to AD categories of elderly control, MCI, and AD than the traditional version of the ADAS-cog. Furthermore, we showed that ADAS.Tree provides at least comparable predictive power for 12-month conversion from MCI to AD when compared with optimized biomarker profiles derived from volumetric MRI, FDG-PET, or CSF analysis. Much of the predictive power of the ADAS.Tree model is derived from the Delayed Word Recall task, with a lesser, but significant, contribution from the Number Cancellation task, both of which are not typically included in the ADAScog when used as a primary outcome measure for registration trials. It is important to note that the ADAS.Tree, which was optimized to discriminate between diagnostic categories, not to predict MCI to AD conversion, performed as well as composite imaging signatures that were optimized for the conversion from MCI to AD. These data suggest that a modified weighting system of the expanded ADAS-cog may play a role in an optimal screening algorithm for the prediction of MCI to AD conversion.\nMultiple previous studies have identified prognostic markers for progression of MCI to AD. Deficits in episodic memory and/or executive function, 19 total ADAS-cog, 20 abnormal CSF [low Ab (total or subtypes), high tau and/or high P-tau], 21 whole brain or regional volume changes, 22, 23 decreases in brain metabolic activity, 24, 25 brain PIB binding, 26, 27 or combinations of the above, 28 can predict the conversion from MCI to AD. However, few studies have compared CSF or imaging markers with cognitive markers. One example is Fleisher et al 29 who studied 129 MCI participants over 36 months, and found that the optimal prediction model consisted of delayed 10-word recall, the NYU delayed paragraph recall and the ADAScog. Addition of volumetric MRI did not increase the performance of the model. Similarly, Jack et al 30 found that baseline free and cued selective recall performed as well as baseline hippocampal volume in the prediction of conversion of MCI to AD. These studies are consistent with our findings that cognitive assessments perform similarly to imaging biomarkers in the prediction of MCI to AD conversion. In contrast, Anchisi et al 31 found that a composite of several volumes of interest in temporoparietal regions and posterior cingulate cortex was a better predictor than any of several individual cognitive tests, with the California Verbal Learning Test-long delay being the best cognitive predictor (AUC from the ROC curve for FDG-PET=0.863 vs. 0.783 for CVLT-long delay). In addition, Devanand et al 31 found that a model that contained demographic data and the Selective Reminding Test and the WAIS-Digit-Symbol test (encompassing similar cognitive domains as the Delayed Word Recall and Number Cancellation Task, tested here), had 80% sensitivity (at a fixed specificity of 80%) for prediction of conversion from MCI to AD over 3 years. Addition of baseline hippocampal and entorhinal cortex volumes enhanced sensitivity to 83.3%.\nIn interpreting the findings from the present analyses, it should be noted that the MCI participants in ADNI were selected to meet Petersen criteria for amnestic MCI, and as such, represent a more advanced point in the disease spectrum than MCI participants in some other studies. This may account in part for the predictive value of the number cancellation task, which is more attuned to later-stage MCI patients. Our analyses may well have yielded different ADAS-cog weightings and predictive biomarkers if applied to an earlier MCI population.\nOur approach differs from many of the other approaches in 2 important respects. First, we have focused on the short-term (12-mo) conversion rates from MCI to AD, whereas many of the others have looked at longer periods. Indeed, many other types of biomarkers such as CSF Ab/p-tau 21 or combinations of CSF and brain blood flow 33 have shown a very impressive ability to predict conversion from MCI to AD over a 4-year to 5-year followup period. However, in both of these studies, review of the 12-month conversion data shows very modest separation at best. The second major difference is the use of a novel multivariate approach to generate a weighting system for the ADAS-cog. Multivariate approaches coupled with machine learning algorithms provide a powerful means to The number of markers prefiltered (if any), final signature size, fitted model, and the corresponding sensitivity, specificity, AUC, and MCC from the 10 repetitions of fully embedded 5-fold stratified cross-validation are shown. Standard Errors (SE) are derived from these 10 repetitions.\nDLDA indicates Diagonal Linear Discriminant Analysis; DQDA, Diagonal Quadratic Discriminant Analysis.\nexplore a massive dataset (such as ADNI) for optimal and robust combinations of predictors. In this study, the ADAS.Tree, whose components were weighted using a Random-Forest-based algorithm, outperformed the unweighted ADAS.All by nearly an order of magnitude. This is consistent with other work demonstrating a substantial advantage of the use of machine-based multivariate analyses. 34, 35 There are several advantages to an enrichment scheme based on cognitive testing, rather than imaging or CSF biomarkers. First, from a pragmatic and cost-containment point of view, cognitive testing is clearly superior. Unlike proposals to use imaging and CSF biomarkers as outcome measures, which could potentially be feasible when applied to satellite populations, 36 assessing all potential participants through volumetric MRI, FDG-PET, or lumbar puncture for purposes of enrichment could severely limit the number of participants screened for a study. In addition, screening participants through a biological marker such as Ab deposition (eg, as imputed indirectly based on low concentrations of CSF Ab 1 \u00c0 42 ), may enrich for a population that is less sensitive, for any given level of cognitive performance, to drug effects as the pathology may be further along its destructive cascade. It may also be argued that CSF or imaging biomarkers add specificity to the prediction of MCI to AD conversion. However, we found that the addition of these markers did not substantially alter the model's specificity for progression from MCI to AD.\nWe have relied on processed data from the ADNI dataset to derive our predictive models. It is possible that other approaches to processing the raw imaging data may produce more robust predictors of MCI to AD conversion. This is suggested by this study, where similar anatomical regions that were processed differently (eg, left precuneus in Table 4 ) are seen more than once, but with different P-values for prediction of MCI to AD conversion. It is also possible that markers that combine modalities, such as CSF+imaging or genotype+imaging may provide better predictors of MCI to AD conversion. However, on the latter point, it is worth noting that combination biomarker approaches that cross domains (eg, imaging+CSF), place a high burden on the conduct of the study, such that enhanced predictive power may be of very little practical value.\nAnother important methodologic issue raised by this study is that of cross-validation. Many studies of the predictive and diagnostic utility of AD biomarkers report sensitivity and specificity values, or ROC AUC values, based on the application of a decision rule onto the same set of data from which that model was generated. This may generate inflated values of specificity and sensitivity. 15 By contrast, we have used a form of cross-validation, described in the Methods section, to determine the sensitivity and specificity of our predictive models. For this reason, the values of sensitivity and specificity reported in this study are lower than those typically reported in other studies that have not used cross-validation. Clearly, the optimum form of validation will involve testing our model on a novel database, and this external validation will be pursued in the future.\nThis study also raises questions about the overall utility of the traditional ADAS-cog as a metric of cognitive function. The ADAS-cog has not changed in form since it was first introduced in 1984. Although it has gained popularity, primarily driven by its ability to detect drug effects in the pivotal trials of the cholinesterase inhibitors, it has well-recognized ceiling effects that limit its usefulness in patients with MCI or mild AD."}]
