[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Continental", "text": "shelf circulation results from both local and offshore forcing. Local forcing is by momentum and buoyancy input at the sea surface and buoyancy input at the land boundary. Offshore forcing is by momentum and buoyancy input at the shelf break. The partition of influence between these contributing factors varies with shelf location and geometry, and nowhere is this partition quantitatively accounted for. How clarified in section 6. These boundary layer influences, coupled with the coastline constraint, result in kinematical and dynamical characteristics of the inner shelf that may differ markedly from those occurring farther offshore. Generally, for synopticscale variability where wind stress is the principal motive agent, the inner shelf reacts to the presence of the coast through the establishment of a surface pressure gradient. This occurs through divergence brought about by surface and bottom Ekman layer transports [e.g., Gill, 1982 Lentz, 1995] . Two dimensions, however, exclude the interactions that may occur between local and large-scale processes and the possibility that the dynamical interactions controlling divergence and vertical motion may vary in the along-shelf direction. For example, in contrast with the two-dimensional circulation pattern of equal and opposite upper and lower layer flows reported by Lentz [1994] for the northern California coast, Munchow and Chant [2000] report a fully three-dimensional flow with a net across-shelf transport for the New Jersey coast. Three dimensionality there is attributed to an along-shelf pressure gradient force due to coastal geometry and baroclinicity. Long-wave models that assume a boundary condition of no net across-shelf flow at some distance from the coast [e.g., Clarke and Van Gorder, 1986; Lopez and Clarke, 1989] are to some extent contrary to these findings, and additional sensitivity studies such as that by Samelson [1997] are warranted. While the general physical concepts espoused in all of these studies apply, it is becoming increasingly clear that each individual continental shelf environment is somewhat unique and that the region of the inner shelf, where important across-shelf transports occur, requires better understanding."}, {"section_title": "The Observations and the Model", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Observations", "text": "Exploratory measurements of inner shelf velocity profiles on the WFS were initiated in November 1996 with the deployment on the 20 m isobath offshore of Sarasota, Florida, of a bottommounted 300 kHz acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) manufactured by RD Instruments, Inc. Using 0.5 m bin spacing, and after editing surface effects, the data set yielded horizontal velocity profiles between depths of 2.5 and 16 m. Ancillary data sets include sea level from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) tide gauge at St. Petersburg, Florida, surface winds from NOAA buoy 42036 located at midshelf, and velocity profile data from a buoy of either downslope or upslope density transports, respectively, has been offered in explanation. As we will discuss, however, these boundary layer turbulence arguments do not explain the response asymmetry reported here."}, {"section_title": "Model", "text": "We employ the Princeton Ocean Model (POM) [Blumberg and Mellor, 1987] Sixteen sigma levels are used in the vertical, distributed logarithmically about the middle to achieve finer resolution of the surface and bottom boundary layers relative to the interior. Other WFS applications of this model grid, along with discussions of the open boundary conditions, are given by Li [1998] and Li and Weisberg [1999a, 1999b] .\nThe model is forced from mid-March through April 1998 by a spatially uniform, time-dependent wind stress.

We begin with daily snapshots of sea level from day 7 through day 14 (Figure 6a ) for the stratified experiment. Peak downwelling and upwelling responses in the sea level fields (as with all other fields) appear on days 9 and 12, respectively. During these peaks the setdown at the coast for the upwelling response in general is more than a factor of 2 larger than the setup at the coast for the downwelling response. Moreover, the offshore scale for the upwelling response largely exceeds that for the downwelling re- 12 is shown in Figure 13 . The ordering of terms is the same as in Figure 12 . The difference is in the magnitude and the offshore scale of the Coriolis and pressure gradient terms. Here the pressure gradient nodal line extends out to the 100 m isobath, the coastal jet is much stronger, and hence the bottom Ekman layer is much more developed. Opposite to the downwelling case, the pressure gradient increases across the bottom Ekman layer because of the slope of the isopycnals there. We will return to this point in section 7."}, {"section_title": "\u00beorticity Balance", "text": "Our analysis of the vertically integrated vertical component of vorticity is similar to that of Ezer and Mellor [1994] . Taking the curl of the vertically integrated momentum equations, we discuss the vorticity balance with respect to four terms: (1) stress torque, (2) bottom pressure torque, (3) stretching of planetary vorticity by free surface deformation (plus the planetary beta effect), and (4) the material rate of change of relative vorticity (plus the stretching and tilting of relative vorticity by the flow field). Since we employed a spatially uniform wind stress, the stress torque is entirely due to bottom stress. The bottom pressure torque, through the bottom kinematic boundary condition, is the stretching of planetary vorticity by geostrophic flow across the sloping bottom. This is generally much larger than the stretching by free surface deformation (or by the planetary beta effect that we lumped together with free surface term). The residual of these tendencies is the variation in relative vorticity (that we lumped together with the kine- Figure 15 shows the four fields for the day 9 peak downwelling response. Once the pressure field and coastal jets are established, the inner shelf is the region where the primary vorticity balance is between the bottom stress and bottom pressure torques. At this time the stretching of planetary vorticity by free surface deformation is small everywhere except for regions of strong eddies that form along the shelf break. The bottom pressure torque is large everywhere, but this tendency to induce relative vorticity can only be offset where large near-bottom currents are capable of producing large bottom stresses, i.e., only in the inner shelf region for this local windforced experiment. Elsewhere, the imbalance in these vorticity tendency terms leads to a large material rate of change of relative vorticity. Thus the primary balance for the inner shelf is between the bottom stress and bottom pressure torques, whereas the primary balance for the shelf break is between the bottom pressure torque and material rate of change of relative vorticity. Similar field representations for the day 12 peak upwelling response are shown in Figure 16 . The conclusions are the same as with Figure 15 with the added point of asymmetry. The offshore scale of the inner shelf is larger for the day 12 upwelling response than it is for the day 9 downwelling response. an understanding of the shelf responses to its various forcing agents: momentum input at the sea surface and shelf break and buoyancy input at the sea surface, shelf break, and land. Since each continental shelf is different, and since so many processes are involved, it is useful to isolate regions and forcing conditions to answer smaller subsets of questions. Along this vein we focus on the WFS, which is wide enough for its inner shelf to be distinguished from the shelf break. Using in situ data and a numerical model simulation, we ask how well the currents over the inner shelf are accounted for by local wind forcing alone. In doing this we describe the boundary layer effects that account for the transports across the inner shelf, provide a dynamical definition of the inner shelf, and describe an asymmetry in the inner shelf responses to upwelling versus downwelling favor- [1993] provide a conceptual and analytical basis for it. Their argument is that stratification impedes across-shelf transport in the bottom Ekman layer on a slope when the buoyancy force tends to balance the Coriolis force of the along-shelf velocity component. We diagnose this concept from both momentum and vorticity perspectives. With respect to momentum the sea level response to downwelling winds results in an offshore-directed pressure gradient force that drives the offshore-directed flow in the bottom Ekman layer. Isopycnals bending into the bottom result in a buoyancy force that opposes this (Figure 12) . In contrast to downwelling the sea level response to upwelling winds results in an onshoredirected pressure gradient force that drives an onshoredirected flow in the bottom Ekman layer. Isopycnals bending into the bottom now result in a buoyancy force that enhances this (Figure 13) . Granted, fewer isopycnals bend into the bottom; nevertheless, the ones that do act constructively rather than destructively."}, {"section_title": "Summary and Discussion", "text": "The simplest explanation for the asymmetry derives from the \nwhere u and v are the across-shelf and along-shelf velocity components, respectively, p is density, K is the vertical eddy coefficient, and R is the residual. For downwelling, planetary vorticity tilting tends to be balanced by buoyancy torque, requiring less relative vorticity dissipation. For upwelling the buoyancy torque, while reduced in magnitude from the downwelling case, adds to the planetary vorticity tilting, requiring increased relative vorticity dissipation. We demonstrate these effects in Figure 17 by Figure 11) that the bottom boundary layer scale is actually larger for upwelling. We reconcile this discrepancy by noting that our larger boundary layer scale for upwelling follows from the larger upwelling response. Had the upwelling and downwelling responses on the WFS been of equal magnitude with regard to the interior along-shelf flows, as in the numerical experiments reported by Garrett et al. [1993] , then we would have expected results similar to theirs. Asymmetry in the bottom boundary layer is important in nature for the rea-sons espoused in these earlier papers, including Weatherly and Martin [1978] .\nThe inner shelf provides added importance to these stratified boundary layer concepts on a slope. For the inner shelf the surface pressure gradient set up by surface Ekman layer divergence, the geostrophic interior flow adjustment to the pressure gradient, and the bottom Ekman layer reaction to the interior flow all occur nearly in unison. Anything that impedes one of these three steps will impede all of them. Thus, by inhibiting (or promoting) the bottom Ekman layer, thereby reducing (or increasing) the near-bottom divergence that is necessary to feed the near-surface divergence, stratification produces the asymmetry in the magnitude and offshore extent of the responses to downwelling and upwelling A related conclusion is that the seasonal and synoptic scales cannot be fully separated. With synoptic-scale wind-forced responses dependent on stratification it is necessary either to assimilate density data into a model or to simulate density changes through a combination of surface buoyancy fluxes and active offshore boundary conditions. In our case a 45 day (15 days of startup and 30 days of analysis) simulation worked well, whereas attempts to carry the model integration longer met with increasing deviations from the in situ data because of density field changes. Nowcasting and forecasting of the inner shelf must be supported by sufficient in situ data for density field assimilation and boundary conditions."}]
