These images show a gross reduction of volume of brain matter with enlarged lateral ventricle. We conducted the experiment of registration using T 1/ T 2 weighted MR and CT imaging modalities of ventricular region of brain in AD patients [3] . Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (DMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of brain provide a cognitive assessment in white matter fibers tract integrity as a biomarker for AD. These findings are correlated with cognitive assessments and rates of AD progression and differentiate between mild cognitive impairment, AD, and other dementias. DTI provides information about anatomical microstructures changes in tissues with aging and aging-related cognitive decline in [4, 5] . Diffusion process of water molecules in tissue is either isotropic or anisotropic. In isotropic diffusion, water molecules diffuse equally in all directions and are found in the gray matter (GM) of the brain. In the anisotropic process, water molecules have a preferred direction of diffusion and are found in the white matter of the brain. In such tissue, diffusion is normally highly restricted along the fiber membranes. DTI measures of diffusion anisotropic movement of water in white matter of brain provides more information about white matter fiber tract integrity [6] . DTI provides the parameters such as fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) or mean diffusivity to quantify the degree of preferred water diffusion restriction in different tissues. FA have values with ranges from 0 to 1, indicating the degree of anisotropy, and tissues with high anisotropy in white matter tracts have a value closer to 1. FA values were found to be significantly reduced in AD patients, especially in the posterior of the brain. These findings may provide image methods to diagnose patients with early stage AD. Mean diffusivity, which is calculated as the mean of the three eigen values in the three different axes of the diffusion tensor [7] and its value max, increase or decrease depending on the histopathological progression of the lesion [8, 9] . This paper proposes a model for early detection of AD using the measurements of ADC, FA, and GM from the diffusion magnetic resonance images of brain white matter. These are taken as input parameters into fuzzy tools, and using fuzzy rules, we evaluate the AD score as an output variable. We have presented a neural network (NN) system which is an important model for the purpose of classification of AD. LevenbergMarquardt (LM) is a feed forward back propagation learning algorithm which is used to train the NN for the diagnosis of AD [10, 11] . The performance of the feature extraction method is evaluated on an experimental data set of 20 samples, taken from a database in the literature [12] .

We used the fuzzy (if-then) rules by taking three extracted features of ADC, FA, and GM values from the DMRI images of brain as input variables and evaluated the AD score as an output variable, which provides a useful platform to physicians in determining the status of the disease.

DTI provides information about anatomical microstructure changes in tissues with aging and aging-related cognitive decline in the brain of AD patients. DTI is an important tool to map the anisotropic water diffusion in the tissues. It visualizes the brain white matter tracts and tracks the diseased fibers or trauma. DTI can reveal abnormalities in white matter fiber structure or neurological disorder patterns in a variety of diseases including stroke, multiple sclerosis, dyslexia, schizophrenia, and tumor in brain white matter and provides a model of brain connectivity.

The processed images appear better in quality for diagnostics purpose and to distinguish more clearly the superimposed structures of the images. For certain specific application, the digital radiographs are modified by image enhancement and restoration to get more suitable results. Enhancement techniques convolve the gray level of a pixel independently of its neighbors using spatial masks. Enhancement includes image smoothing by two-dimensional filtering of images, sharpening, edge detection, and contrast stretching. Image segmentation is the process of localization of the ROI in the images. This is particularly true in radiographic image analysis where one needs accurate outlines of an object which is not too clearly defined in the original image.
