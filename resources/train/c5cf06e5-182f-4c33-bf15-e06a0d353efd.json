Additional data were collected outside the northern Cape Cod Survey area during USGS surveys 06012, 07001, 07003. The data from those surveys, not included in this report, may be found in Barnhardt and others (2010 "}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "This report presents high-resolution geophysical data of the seafloor between Duxbury Beach and Provincetown, MA, in northern Cape Cod Bay ( fig. 1 ). Approximately 480 square kilometers (km2) of the inner continental shelf were mapped focusing on the northern (deeper) section of Cape Cod Bay. This report is the fifth in a series (Barnhardt and others, 2006 (Barnhardt and others, , 2009 (Barnhardt and others, , 2010 Ackerman and others, 2006) published through a cooperative mapping program between the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the Massachusetts Office of Coastal Zone Management (CZM) (Web address: http://woodshole.er.usgs.gov/project-pages/coastal_mass/).\nThe long-term objectives of this mapping program are to provide a framework for scientific research and to develop geologic information to manage coastal and marine resources. High-resolution spatial data and detailed maps of seafloor geology build a foundation for protecting fish habitat, delineating m arine resources, and assessing environmental changes caused by natural or human impacts. This report documents the data collection and processing methods used during the five surveys conducted between 2006 and 2008. Also included in this report are the processed geophysical datasets (bathymetry, acoustic-backscatter intensity, and seismic-reflection), seafloor photographs and, textural analyses of sediment samples. These data products are integrated within a Geographic Information System (GIS) to help guide future management decisions and will form the basis for interpretive geological maps that will be published for the region.\nCape Cod Bay is a large, semi-enclosed embayment at the southernmost margin of the Gulf of Maine. It is bounded on the east and south by the Cape Cod peninsula, on the west by the mainland, and on the north it opens into Massachusetts Bay ( fig. 1 ). The general configuration of the bay is controlled by the lithology and structural features of the region's underlying bedrock (Oldale and Bick, 1987) . During the last glaciation, a large lobe of the Laurentide Ice Sheet advanced from the north and occupied Cape Cod Bay. Sediments deposited along the margins of this ice lobe form the moraines, outwash plains, and other glacial features that characterize the region (Uchupi and others, 1996) . During retreat of the ice, proglacial lakes briefly occupied the bay (Oldale, 1982) prior to marine incursion caused by rising sea level in the late Pleistocene. Following deglaciation of the region, relative sea-level change has been the major process shaping the coast and inner shelf over the last 14,500 years (Oldale and others, 1993) . Shoreline regression and transgression have reworked a broad expanse of seafloor along the western margin of the bay. These shallow (0-40 m) nearshore areas are characterized by rugged rock outcrops, large piles of boulders, and relatively thin, discontinuous deposits of sand and gravel. In contrast, thick deposits of sandy and muddy sediment have accumulated in the deeper (> 40 meters) central part of the bay, creating a generally low relief, smoothly sloping seafloor (Oldale and O'Hara, 1990; Uchupi and others, 2005) ."}, {"section_title": "Data Collection and Processing", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Survey Operations", "text": "The data presented in this report were collected in northern Cape Cod Bay during four geophysical surveys (USGS field activity numbers 06012, 07001, 07002, and 08002) and one bottom sampling survey (07003) "}, {"section_title": "Bathymetry", "text": "Bathymetric data were acquired using a Systems Engineering & Assessment, Ltd. (SEA) SWATHplus interferometric sonar system operating at a frequency of 234 or 117 kilohertz (kHz) (figs. 3-4; table 1). During surveys 06012 and 07002, the sonar transducers were mounted on a rigid pole from the starboard side of the R/V Megan T. Miller ( fig. 2A) , about 2.6 m below the water line. During surveys 07001 and 08002, the sonar transducers were mounted on a rigid pole from the bow of the R/V Rafael ( fig. 2B ), about 0.5 m below the water line. A motion reference unit (TSS Ltd. Dynamic Motion Sensor (DMS) 2-05 for 06012, and Coda Octopus F180 for 07001, 07002, and 08002) was mounted directly above the transducers and continuously measured vertical displacement (heave) and attitude (pitch and roll) of the vessel during acquisition. Data were acquired with a sonar transmit power of 6-8 (on a relative scale ranging from 1-15 representing 0-100 percent power levels), transmit length of 11-39 cycles, and a receive length of 2,048 or 4,096 samples, depending on the individual survey. Navigation was recorded with a GPS antenna mounted on top of the pole, directly above the SWATHplus transducers. Horizontal and vertical offsets between navigation and attitude antennas and the SWATHplus transducers were applied during acquisition in the configuration files for the SWATHplus and Octopus F180 software. Sound-velocity profiles were collected approximately every 2 hours during all surveys using a hand-casted Applied MicroSystems SV Plus sound velocimeter. A total of 3,289 km of bathymetry were surveyed at an average speed of 5 knots ( fig. 3) . The lines were spaced 75 to 200 m apart to obtain overlapping swaths of data and complete coverage of the seafloor. The swath width collected by the SWATHplus system was adjusted based on the trackline spacing for the specific survey.\nReal-Time Kinematic Global Positioning System (RTK-GPS) navigation was used to determine the horizontal and vertical position (x, y, z) of the GPS antenna mounted above the SWATHplus transducers with sub-meter accuracy. The RTKcorrected coordinates were transmitted to the ship from a land-based RTK-DGPS station established by the USGS at NOAA tidal station # 8446009 in Brant Rock, MA ( fig. 1) . Vertical water-level heights were referenced to Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW) using the offset between North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD 88) and MLLW published for the tidal benchmark at the station. SWATHplus acquisition software and the Computer Aided Resource Information System (CARIS) Hydrographic Information Processing System (HIPS 6.1) were used to process the raw bathymetric soundings. Navigation data were inspected and edited to eliminate erroneous fixes. Soundings were adjusted using corrections from the motion reference unit (MRU), RTK-GPS water-level heights, and sound-velocity profile data. Spurious soundings were eliminated, and the final processed soundings were gridded at a resolution of 5-m per pixel (fig. 4) ."}, {"section_title": "Acoustic Backscatter", "text": "Approximately 3,009 km of acoustic backscatter data were acquired using a Klein 3000 dual-frequency sidescan-sonar operating at 132/445 kHz, or a SWATHplus interferometric sonar operating at 117-kHz ( fig. 5 ). During surveys 06012 and 07002 the Klein 3000 towfish was deployed from an A-frame and towed approximately 20 m astern and 5 m below the surface and collected data with a 200-m swath width (100 m on either side of the vessel). During surveys 07001 and 08002, the Klein 3000 towfish was deployed approximately 3 m astern from a davit on the port side and 1 m below the sea surface and collected data with a 100-m swath width. Backscatter data collected with the SWATHplus sonar were used for lines L68-L73 of survey 07002 because the A-frame used for the Klein 3000 sidescan sonar was inoperable between August 1 and 2, 2007.\nThe 132-kHz data were acquired using a 75-100 m range, a 50 millisecond (ms) pulse length, and a time-varying gain (tvg) of 9-12 decibels (dB) as recorded in the Klein SonarPro acquisition software (versions 9.6 and 10.0) and later corrected for beam angle and slant range distortions by using Xsonar/ShowImage as described in Danforth (1997) . The SWATHplus backscatter data were acquired with Swath Processor acquisition software and processed for radiometric normalization corrections using SXP Tools (unpublished USGS software). Each survey line was mapped into geographic space at 1 m pixel resolution, then imported into PCI Geomatica (version 10.1) and combined into a single mosaic. The mosaic was exported out of PCI as an 8-bit georeferenced Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) image ( fig. 6 )."}, {"section_title": "Seismic-Reflection Profiling", "text": "Approximately 3,270 km of chirp seismic-reflection data were collected in the northern Cape Cod Bay survey area ( fig. 7) . During surveys 06012 and 07002, chirp seismic data were collected using an EdgeTech Geo-Star FSSB sub-bottom profiling system and an SB-0512i towfish (FM swept frequency 0.5-12 kHz), which was mounted on a catamaran and towed astern of the R/V Megan T. Miller. EdgeTech J-Star seismicacquisition software was used to control the Geo-Star topside unit, digitally log trace data in the EdgeTech JSF format, and record GPS navigation coordinates to the JSF trace headers. Data were acquired using a 0.25-second (s) shot rate, a 9-millisecond (ms) pulse length, and a 0.5-to 6-kHz frequency spectrum during survey 06012, and a 0.25-s shot rate, a 5-ms pulse length, and a 0.5-to 8-kHz frequency spectrum during 07002. Recorded trace lengths were either 250 or 266 ms. Northwest-southeast oriented tracklines were spaced 100 m apart for 06012 and 07002. Tielines collected during 07002 were spaced between 1,000 and 3,500 m apart.\nDuring survey 07001, chirp seismic data were collected using an EdgeTech GeoStar FSSB sub-bottom profiling system and an SB-424 towfish (FM swept frequency 4 24 kHz), which was mounted on a rigid pole on the starboard side of the R/V Rafael. EdgeTech J-Star and Triton Imaging, Inc. SB-Logger seismic-acquisition software was used to control the Geo-Star topside unit, digitally log trace data in EdgeTech JSF and SEG-Y Revision 1 formats, respectively, and record GPS navigation coordinates to the JSF and SEG-Y trace headers. Data were acquired using a 0.25-s shot rate, a 10-ms pulse length, and a 4-to 16-kHz frequency spectrum. Recorded trace lengths were approximately 250 ms. Northwest-southeast oriented tracklines were spaced between 75 and 100 m apart.\nDuring survey 08002, chirp seismic data were collected using a dual-frequency (3.5 and 200 kHz) Knudsen Engineering Limited Chirp 3200 system with transducers mounted on a rigid pole on the starboard side of the R/V Rafael. Knudsen SounderSuite seismic-acquisition software was used to control the Chirp 3200 system, digitally log trace data in the SEG-Y Revision 1 format, and record GPS navigation coordinates to the SEG-Y trace headers. Data were acquired using a 0.25-or 0.5-s shot rate, a 1-or 2-ms pulse length, and a center frequency of 3.5 kHz. Recorded trace lengths were 67 and 135 ms, depending on the shot rate interval. Northwest-southeast oriented tracklines were spaced between 75 and 150 m apart.\nAll of the raw chirp seismic-reflection data were post-processed using SIOSEIS (Henkart, 2007) and Seismic Unix (Stockwell and Cohen, 2007) . Post-processing included the inspection and editing of navigation data, the auto identification of seafloor reflections based on amplitude, and the removal of sea-surface heave from the trace data. Profiles of the final processed trace data are included in this report as 8-bit, grayscale, variable-density plots in the Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) format. The final shot-point and trackline navigation are also included in two ESRI shapefiles."}, {"section_title": "Ground Validation Surficial Sediment Samples and Grain-Size Analyses", "text": "Sediment samples were collected at 98 stations with a modified Van Veen grab sampler at the end of the drift. Sediment samples were not obtained at 10 locations because of hard or rocky seafloor. The upper 2 cm of sediment from the top of the Van Veen grab were sampled and analyzed at the USGS sediment laboratory for grain size following the standard procedures described in Poppe and others (2005) . The analytical data for each sample included location, bulk weight, percent of sample in each 1-phi size class from -5 phi to 11 phi, sediment classification, kurtosis, and other sediment-related statistics. These data are available in spreadsheet or geospatial format in Appendix 2 (Textural Analyses)."}, {"section_title": "Photography and Video", "text": "The USGS SEABed Observation and Sampling System (SEABOSS; Valentine and others, 2000) was deployed from the R/V Connecticut during survey 07003 to validate the geophysical data collected in the northern Cape Cod Bay survey area ( fig. 6 ; table 1). At each of the 109 planned stations, the SEABOSS was lowered to the seafloor from a J-frame on the starboard side of the R/V Connecticut and collected continuous bottom video (not included in this report) as the vessel and sampler drifted for about 5-7 minutes at each station. One hundred of the stations were located within the northern Cape Cod Bay survey area, and nine stations were sampled to the west, at the entrance to Plymouth Bay. Six hundred and seventy-three high-resolution digital photographs were taken with a Minolta Dimage A2 digital camera at user-defined locations along the drift.
