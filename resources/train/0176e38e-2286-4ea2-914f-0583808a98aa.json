[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The expansion of the service sector provides some questions regarding the forms of innovation in the industry. In this sense, there are concerns about the need to establish models and ways to measure innovation activities. Services got the attention of researchers in the '70s, albeit with strictly technological innovations (Bilderbeek et al, 1998). In the '90s, there were the first improvements especially for innovations in services Savona, 2009). This incipient scientific production provides industry analyses that influence the myths about the sector. Since innovation processes in the service sector are not completely different than those identified in the manufacturing sector, integrating models seem to open new possibilities for their analysis. Although some progress has been made regarding the convergence in the definition and models of innovation in industry and services, the particularities of the tertiary sector instigate some questions about the background of the innovation process. This way, research on the innovation processes in the sector allows some particularities to be better studied. In this sense, the adequacy of concepts and indicators of Research and Development (R&D) used to evaluate the innovative activities of the service sector are questioned. Despite R&D in services being a reality, its identification and measurement is difficult, considering the particularities of the sector that do not fit the concepts and indicators used primarily by the industrial sector. As described by Djellal et al (2003), the fact that most of the activities in service fit in the Social Sciences and Humanities brings bias to much of the service surveys. In services, the production process is often adjacent to consumption. The interactivity among producers / providers -consumers / customers determines which processes are carried out among the several departments and organizations, making it impossible to identify a specific R&D department or sector (OECD, 2002;Miles, 2007). Furthermore, the unique interactivity of production in services is extended to its innovation processes and R&D activities. In these situations, the indicators used in the industry are unable to monitor R&D management and to conduct a reliable evaluation of its investments and profits. The way these different characteristics of the service sector influence the identification and measurement of their R&D should be studied in a more specific way. Thus, this paper aims to improve the analysis and measurement of R&D in services, from concepts and indicators adopted in international surveys, but incorporating those elements to the reality of services. In order to empirically test the appropriateness and limitations of concepts and indicators, considering the particularities of the service sector, thirty-five R&D case studies were analyzed in hospital services in French university hospitals (CHU). To expose the results of this research, this paper is organized as it follows. In the first section, we deepen the debate about the conceptual aspects of the analysis of R&D in services just as they are defined in the main international standards. Then, we bring to the fore, the main features of service activities and discuss their implications for the analysis of R&D in the sector, taking as theoretical background the representation of the service product based on its features, as proposed by Gallouj (2002). In the third section, we present and discuss the categories of analysis based on the results of case studies in the university hospitals in France. Finally, in our conclusion remarks, we aim to list the contributions of this study to expand the concept and indicators of R&D in the service sector."}, {"section_title": "The particularities of services and their impacts on the innovation process", "text": "The service sector keeps particularities which differ from other economic sectors, consequently impacting on their products and processes of innovation. Although neo-Schumpeterian authors devoted to the service sector do not indicate the need for a specific innovation theory to services, they advocate an integrated analysis between services and industry (Gallouj, 1994;Vargas, 2006). The analysis of such specificities is important for understanding their impacts on innovation processes and the analysis of R&D in services. Amongst the most striking features of the service sector is the difficulty in defining the service product. The intangible nature of services is revealed as a major obstacle in identifying and measuring the sector activities. In addition, since most of service industry is included in the field of Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH), as described by Djellal et al (2003) and OECD (2002), the typical challenges of the area apply to the sector. Admitting that the SSH deal with the study of social aspects of human reality, the intangibility of the product of these activities, mainly those related to the service sector, determine that its measurement is greatly affected in the statistics. As noted by Miles (2007), due to the characteristics of the social research, it is hard to operationalize the concepts and indicators of Frascati Manual (OECD, 2002), which gives a number of caveats to the concepts applied to the sector. Even if it is not possible to determine that all R&D in services is considered within the scope of the SSH (Djellal et al, 2003), many activities involve the creation of new and unique social relationships and new modes of organization and behavior of the human relations. This way, it seems to be understandable the role of services sector in its development. The challenges arise because the intangibility of R&D inputs, resulting in intangible products, which will not be easily identified and measured. These characteristics seem to expose the service sector to measurements that do not suit its actual role in the results of its R&D activities. In international surveys the difficulties are due to the classification used by OECD (2002) for the fields of science and technology, six major areas are presented. The Social Sciences includes four sub-fields: Psychology, Economics, Educational Sciences and other sciences. Humanities are represented by three sub-fields: History, Languages and literature and Other humanities. Classified as \"Others\" are huge innovation fields, as management, law, political sciences and sociology. Even if these fields are listed in the Manual, in some surveys, the sectors included in the SSH are displayed as \"other.\" This demonstrates a degree of skepticism about the possibility of producing R&D from such fields. Moreover, it seems to lead to an underestimation of the R&D produced by economic sectors dealing with them, mainly the service sector. In an attempt of overcoming such problems, in 2007, the OECD published a reclassification of fields of science and technology, maintaining the six areas, but expanding the sub-fields. The classification allows different implications in different fields of interest such as R&D surveys, R&D projects, and issues regarding the public administration (OECD, 2007). Although some manuals seem to be moving to a better adequacy of concepts, as we shall see in the next section, surveys are not always able to seize such advances empirically, as noted by Miles (2007, p. 254) in criticizing the survey guide of a British research that indicates the exclusion of activities that fall within the SSH, such as \"Market research, operational research, work study, cost analysis, management science, surveying . . .\" The second element that is objective of our analysis, concerning the particularities of the service sector, is the fact that any service provision involves a degree of client / consumer involvement. This is due to the fact that in services the production occurs usually at the same time of its consumption and it is not simple to analyze product and procedure as a separate phase (Kon, 2004;Gallouj, 2002;Miozzo;Soete, 2001;Gadrey, 2001). Then the relatioships blurred throught the production/consumption can be object of multiple analysis. De Bandt and Dibgiaggio (2002) distinguish very well the degree of client consumer involvement as follow: when this relation occurs in a superficial way with no competences interaction or complementarities, it is called as \"service relation\"; otherwise, if the service provision/consumption occurs under a process of complex knowledge transmission or interaction of complementary competencies, a \"co-production\" might happens. Vargas (2006), analyzing hospital services from a techno-economic network view, realizes that there is interaction between heterogeneous actors in the development of a hospital product. Thus, besides the user, the author represents the production of hospital services from the interaction of institutions in regulating services (government and its enforcement agencies, boards or professionals), technical/scientific arena where the influence of science and technological equipment, medicines and laboratory procedures converge, as well as the training of professionals working in the hospital. Finally we suggest that if the service is produced by the involvement of multiple actors (producer and consumer, at least) and that the production and consumption phase are usually the same, it is difficult to indicate a department where the service transactions occur. As a consequence, innovations in services are sparsely produced, as the relationships necessary to the production of services are configured in different sectors or institutions. Miles (2007) affirms that innovations in services are usually organized by means of a temporary project development group or by means of a networking across parts of the organisation. Also, the staff involved on these activities do not have an occupational title related to R&D or others innovative activities. Such forms of organization should not be seen as opposites but as complementary in the establishment of the many forms of organization in services. Trying to represent these multiple specificities of services, considering the immateriality of the final product of a service, the mobilization of different actors and its competences, Gallouj and Weinstein (1997) formulate a general representation of the product as the combination of different competencies and technical characteristics that can influence directly on the service product. Then, the general formulation of the product can be represented as a set of vectors that result in the final characteristics of the service, as represented by Figure 1.  Gallouj (2002, p.58) Considering the approach of the service product as a set of vectors, as shown in Figure 1, Gallouj (2002) Gallouj (2002) show that innovations may be the result of changes that affect one or more elements (competences or characteristics) in the vectors that define the service product. As described by Gallouj and Savona (2009), these dynamics can be either intentional (product of R&D, for example) or unintentional, the result of learning processes. Invariably, affirm the authors, such dynamics represent the evolution or variation, addition or subtraction of one of these elements and the association, dissociation or formatting of one or more elements, which alter the composition of the service product. Besides, explaining the innovation models, the figure above helps us to better understand the particularities and factors involved in the analysis of the production and consumption processes of services, which impact greatly on the R&D activities of the sector. Moreover, as discussed in the following section, these elements will bring difficulties to conceptualize and measure R&D in the service sector. This way, the next section will be dedicated to the analysis of the way the main international surveys are capable of overcoming such difficulties."}, {"section_title": "The design of R&D in international surveys: challenges posed by the service sector", "text": "While the markets were becoming increasingly competitive, innovation processes have become vital to the success of organizations. At the same time, there is a major concern of institutions to better understand the processes of innovation and innovative activities preceding them. In order to guide the interest of the institutions on innovation activities, different national and international institutions have made efforts in proposing definitions and indicators of R&D. Moreover, as noted by the OECD (2002), the need for international comparisons has led many international organizations to establish indicators of Science and Technology (S&T). Concerning specifically the analysis of R&D activities, in 1963 a group of specialists in R&D gathered to organize and publish the Proposed Standard Practice for Surveys of Research and Development well known as Frascati Manual (OECD, 2002). The document is in its sixth edition, is published by OECD, and has been republished to satisfy economic necessities and tendencies concerning R&D. In 1994, a new version was published to fulfill the specificities of the services and human resources sectors. Wider definitions were developed to enable an increment in researches about human and financial indicators (inputs used to measure R&D activities) and public policies (OECD, 2002). Since its origin, the Frascati Manual guides the main efforts in the identification and measurement of R&D internationally. Moreover, it has served as a basis for research, funding, and development of public policies in R&D. According to its concept, R&D activities \"comprise creative work undertaken on a systematic basis in order to increase the stock of knowledge, including knowledge of man, culture and society, and the use of this stock of knowledge to devise new applications\" (OECD, 2002, p.30). The Frascati Manual also distinguishes R&D from other activities of generation and increase of knowledge because they present a considerable element of novelty and resolution of a scientific or technological uncertainty (OECD, 2002). Considering the particularities of the service sector, analyzed in the previous section, and the key elements that compose the idea of R&D, we will conduct a critical analysis on the advances and limitations regarding the main R&D surveys and manuals used internationally."}, {"section_title": "Community Innovation Survey (Eurostat, 2008)", "text": "In Europe, the main surveys on science, technology and innovation are compiled and published by Eurostat, which is the statistical department of the European Community. Eurostat uses the definitions in the Frascati Manual to conduct its surveys. The concept of R&D, quoted above (OECD, 2002) is partially presented in the Community Innovation Survey, the main survey about innovation in Europe: \"Creative work done in the company to increase the stock of knowledge and the use of this knowledge to develop products and new or improved processes (including software development)\" (CIS, 2004, p.5). Even if this definition does not clarify the inclusion of services in the survey, the questionnaire presentation brings the following information: \"...Most questions cover new or significantly improved goods or services or the implementation of new or significantly improved processes, logistics or distribution methods. Organisational and marketing innovations are only covered in section 10.\" (CIS, 2004, p.1). The inclusion of the service sector is mentioned as soon as the respondent begins to answer the survey. However, in the tenth section, which deals with organizational and marketing innovation, R&D is not integrated. Thus, it excludes the possibility of measuring R&D activities that resulted in organizational and marketing innovations, mainly those that fit in the SSH. Although much of the R&D produced by the SSH is not covered by the CIS (2004), it is interesting to notice that the compilation of the many surveys conducted by Eurostat (Eurostat, 2008), takes into account the different fields of science where R&D investments are allocated, and the SSH are part of the results. This analysis is important to make estimates of the service sector, especially considering that most innovations in the sector are related to the social sciences and humanities (Djellal et al., 2003). Regarding the indicators used to assess R&D, there is no innovation in the research by Eurostat, which uses conventional indicators, see in Table 1. Considering R&D personnel, the Survey does not add any information to establish the concepts that enable their identification and it does not stratify this indicator to the field of science (CIS, 2004). In the compendium of surveys, the methodological notes (Eurostat, 2008, p. 211) bring the definitions of the Frascati Manual (OECD, 2002): \"Researchers: They are professionals engaged in the conception or creation of new knowledge, products, processes, methods and systems, and in the management of the projects concerned (Frascati Manual, \u00a7 301); Technicians and equivalent staff: they are persons whose main tasks require technical knowledge and experience in one or more fields of engineering, physical and life sciences or social sciences and humanities (Frascati Manual, \u00a7 306): Other supporting staff: This includes skilled and unskilled craftsmen, secretarial and clerical staff participating in R&D projects or directly associated with such projects (Frascati Manual, \u00a7 309)\". The definition makes no restrictions to the necessity for a department of R&D or the fact that other professionals have to be necessarily linked to the researchers. Thus, it opens a field of possibilities in identifying the actors involved in R&D."}, {"section_title": "Business R&D and Innovation Survey (NSF, 2008)", "text": "In the U.S. there is a specific research for R&D activities conducted by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the U.S. Census Bureau. In 2009, the research entitled Survey of Industrial Research and Development (SIRD) was replaced by the Business R&D and Innovation Survey (BRDIS). The new survey aims to approach elements of a new economy that is not based on industry and attempts to supplant the image that R&D is conducted by laboratories in the institutions where the government is the main funder and that companies have the domestic economy as their main focus (NSF, 2008). The new 2008 survey questionnaire, when compared to 2007, brings appreciable differences that demonstrate concern for better understanding the service sector. R&D definition used in 2007, when the survey was still called \"Industrial\", clearly excluded research in social sciences and psychology. It also mentions that the service sector can benefit from R&D only with regard to applied research and development. Moreover, the new survey clearly includes the service sector in its broad definition of R&D (BRDIS, 2008, p. 4): \"R&D is planned, creative work aimed at discovering new knowledge or developing new or significantly improved goods and services (our mark)\". There are developments in the unfolding of new survey, including the costs of R&D in social sciences, defined as \"the application of scientific methods to the study of the human aspects of the world, including such disciplines as economics and psychology\" (BRDIS, 2008, p.13). However, despite the fact that some expenditure with social sciences was considered, the exclusion of expenditures with \"Costs for routine product testing, quality control, and technical services unless they are an integral part of an R&D project; Market research; Efficiency surveys or management studies; Literary, artistic, or historical projects, such as films, music, or books and other publications and Prospecting or exploration for natural resources\" (BRDIS, 2008, p.4) seems to neglect, for example, the possibility of administrative and socio-cultural studies as being the fruit of the generation and increasing the stock of knowledge that can generate new applications, as described by Bohrer and Vargas (2008). Currently, BRDIS establishes the definition of R&D employees in a similar way to the Frascati Manual (OECD, 2002). This definition is as it follows (BRDIS, 2008, p. 44): \"Include scientists and engineers working on R&D as well as R&D managers, technicians, administrators, clerical staff, and interns providing direct support to R&D\". Although the occupational titles are invariably related to R&D, there is no definition to connect these professionals to an \"R&D department\". Regarding the expenditure indicators used for the survey, it is mentioned that despite efforts to include the service sector, all examples described in the questionnaire were from industry, making it difficult the expansion of concepts for the service sector. Finally, in order to identify the products of R&D activities, the Survey aims to recognize the types of innovation arising from R&D. The alternatives vary widely and meet the neo-Schumpeterian definition."}, {"section_title": "Observatoire des Sciences et Techniques (MESR, 2008)", "text": "In France, the compendium of indicators of science and technology is conducted by the Centre for Science and Techniques (OST, acronym in French for Observatoire des Sciences et Techniques). The publication is produced from the database of research conducted by the Ministry of Higher Education and Research (Minist\u00e8re de l'Enseignement Superieur et de la Recherche -MESR), which will also serve as a reference to us. The questionnaire of the French Ministry (MESR, 2008) conceptualizes R&D in a similar way of the Frascati Manual (OECD, 2002). One of the limitations of the concept is the fact that services are explicitly listed only as a result of development, which puts in doubt the role of industry in research activities (basic and applied).The definition of R&D is thus presented in the Survey: \"creative work (with the objective of getting new knowledge, development, adaptation or improvement of new procedures or products) performed in a systematic way (which implies a minimum of organization and resources) with the objective of increasing the stock of knowledge, as well as the use of this stock of knowledge in new applications\" (MESR, 2008, p.2). The indicators used by the Ministry are presented in Table 1. The survey delimits the different disciplines related to R&D expenditure, asking respondents to indicate the percentage of total expenditure on R&D in every field of science, which also corroborates the indicated by Djellal et al. (2003). Regarding R&D professionals, the survey shows very similar specifications to those presented in the Compendium of the Eurostat (2008), considering researchers and engineers of R&D, technicians, and administrative staff. The definition also covers a range of professionals who carry out different tasks among the complex R&D activities (MESR, 2008). This way, we can see activities that are beyond the limits of an R&D department, whereas related to R&D. The problem is that, as described in the OECD (2002) and Miles (2007), many professionals are not hired as \"researchers\", and therefore are not counted in these surveys. The table below describes the main elements highlighted in the concepts and indicators examined and the advances or limitations related to the service sector. \"Systematic\" is defined as the work undertaken with minimum organization and means. Service innovations are explicitly related to \"development\" outputs. The concepts of R&D presented show a certain movement of the main international surveys to suit the market dynamics that have recognized the efforts of the service sector in searching for innovations. In this sense, the R&D as one of the antecedents of innovation activities, must be identified and measured in the best way by the researches. At the same time, indicators need to evolve to take account of R&D to generate knowledge and add value to relationships that are triggered along the provision or consumption of services. In the next section, we will analyze how the particularities of services are covered by the concepts and indicators used by the major international research, or the way its limitations are shown by them."}, {"section_title": "How R&D in French University Hospitals fits (or not) concepts and indicators", "text": "Our goal in this section is more than to describe cases; it is also to try to show how the specificities of services and of the different international research have an impact in the identification and measurement of R&D in hospital services. Based on this exercise and on the understanding of the determinants, the actors, and the forms R&D has in hospital services, we expect to lead to a better understanding of R&D in services and propose indicators that describe the evolution movement of R&D concepts and indicators in the sector. Hospital services were chosen because they offer an exceptional variety of customized services and professionals (Gadrey, 2002;Marinho and Fa\u00e7anha, 2001). The choice of university hospitals is related to the fact that they are associated with universities, providing undergraduate and graduate programs to form health professionals and researchers. Thus, they bring together competencies that are more prone to R&D, because of the intense activity of teaching, research and science outreachcarried out in its facilities. Based on the concepts presented in the previous sections, we understood that when the generation and increasing the stock of knowledge happens systematically and results in new products or services, it may be considered R&D activities. From the analysis of cases of new products or services that have emerged in the four university hospitals with better performance in the Hospital Program for Clinical Research (PHRC), we noticed the advancements and limitations related to the ways of identifying and measuring R&D in the sector. Hospitals taking part of this research are: Assistance Publique -H\u00f4pitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Hospices Civils de Lyon (HCL), Assistance Publique -H\u00f4pitaux de Marseille (AP-HM) and Centre Hospitalier R\u00e9gional Universitaire de Lille (CHRU de Lille). The research strategy was developed based on the case study (Yin, 2005). In each hospital, innovative services which were introduced based on activities identified as R&D have been analyzed. The first step of the research was to identify new services and/or modified ones, by considering that R&D activities would result in \"new applications\". The option was to investigate the services established or modified between 2005 and 2007. During this period it is believed that the services would have already been tested and consolidated. Thus, services which had already been extinguished were not considered since they were useless or economically unviable. Data collection was conducted between July and August 2009 and supplemented in June 2010. Initially, we searched for the new services in specialized magazines (hospitals own magazines) and a search website on the Internet. It was found thirty-five new services that have become the object of analysis. At a second moment, thirty-four semi-structured interviews were conducted with the coordinators or people responsible for the new services identified, being one of the people interviewed responsible for the creation of two new services and, therefore, was interviewed twice. The interviews and analyses of documents provided by the hospitals have constituted the dataset needed to characterize the new services and activities associated with R&D, which allowed analyzing them according to the concepts and indicators adapted to services. In this paper, three categories of analysis have been privileged in order to face some major challenges of the study of R&D in services: the intangible character of R&D results, especially those belonging to Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) and two categories related to the organization of R&D activity, which are R&D personnel, and the existance of specific R&D departments. It is important to highlight the fact that the cases presented here started from an initial sample of forty case studies. However, since some of them did not meet the requi-rements to be considered as R&D and then they were removed from the sample. Considering the fact that the interviews were conducted with the coordinators of those new services or those significantly modified, innovation was a condition fulfilled by all. However, not all the innovative activity was R&D since either the activity was not the product of the generation or increase the stock of knowledge, or the generation and increase the stock of knowledge had not taken place with minimal organization and resources, as defined by MESR (2008). We do not consider as a starting point the term \"systematic\", by agreeing with the view of Djellal et al (2003). According to the authors, in \"systematizing\" the production of knowledge, the Frascati Manual excludes the possibility of considering \"automatic\" learning processes that produce R&D unintentionally and in a disorganized way. Thus, we state a blurred line between these two terms, identifying a research or administrative project regarding the service to be established or modified or, at least, the identification of the moment in which knowledge started being mobilized to establish the service."}, {"section_title": "The multiplicity of scientific and technological fields in hospital services", "text": "Our first objective will be to examine the field of science on which our cases fit. In order to facilitate the exposure of the cases, we chose to separate them into two major scientific and technological fields, namely, the Natural Sciences and Engineering (NSE) and Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH). The choice of these two fields is justified by the fact that they are the two fields considered by the Government Budget Appropriations or Outlays for R&D by Socio-economic Objectives (GBAORD), presented at the Frascati Manual (OECD, 2002, p.137). We suggest that other areas, especially medical and health sciences might be included in these two fields, as discussed below. It can be supported by the fact that hospital services not only mobilize knowledge in health sciences, their product is the result of scientific and technological advances in several areas, as described by Vargas (2006). The analysis of thirty-five cases allows us to state that, besides the fact that most of them are linked to medical and sanitary sciences, they can also be recognized within the field of SSH, considering that most of them are involved in the mobilization of knowledge related to psychology, administration, and sociology. The Meeting and Information Place (ERI or Espace Rencontre Information, in French) and the Therapeutic Education Group (EET or \u00c9quipe d\"\u00c9ducation Th\u00e9rapeutique, in French) for kidney patients are services that illustrate the assembly of these disciplines to the development of services within medical and hospital services. ERI created at the AP-HP is led by an anthropologist who sought information on specific conferences of this type of service and other hospitals that already had their ERI to set its course of action. Among the activities undertaken by the service are the dissemination of guidelines, provision of material and informative lectures, easily understandable and especially about cancer. After seeking medical knowledge with hospital professionals, the anthropologist articulates information with non-medical vocabulary, without an appointment, not wearing a white coat and through a conversation which allows the reformulation of ideas and exchanges with and between patients. Such actions require specific skills that are linked to her area, such as psychology and sociology, but which depended on expertise developed especially to create the new service. EET implemented at the HCL, by a nurse, has its focus on generating knowledge aimed at issues related to the approach and management of the kidney patient and his family, which involves a lot of knowledge that goes beyond the medical courses, to include social and psychological aspects of hospital service. Therefore, the nurse in charge sought knowledge on the recommendations of the Health Department and met with other teams in search of practical knowledge, especially regarding the issues addressed in team meetings, as well as for formulating the questionnaire that aims to record the history of medical and social aspects of the patient. Professors give courses to professionals, which allowed the generation of theoretical knowledge in terms of clinical aspects of the patient. Finally, the various professionals who compose the service exchange knowledge that result in a service to prevent the consequences of kidney failure from an approach specifically geared to the lifestyle of the patient served. In some cases, the knowledge mobilized is linked specifically to the management of a service, while they referred to the generation of knowledge concerning the reorganization of the physical, financial and human resources of the existing services. In order to illustrate these cases, we cite the establishment of the Dental Emergency at the HCL. The dental clinic already existed, but did not have an emergency ward, which caused problems to the patients who had an appointment, but were not seen on time because of the emergencies. To solve this problem, the service administrators (dentists) prepared a hospital-clinic project, where they estimated the staff, equipment, and consultation costs and expenses. They also certified the financial balance of the proposed activities, which required the generation of knowledge specifically of administration. Knowledge was exchanged with other heads of service in the meetings of department coordinators, in which information regarding the operation of services is exchanged and discussed. Organizational skills related to the admission of patients in emergency were mobilized. Unlike patients who do not need emergency care, emergency patients must be seen as soon as they reach the hospital and, therefore, are admitted without filling the admission form. This procedure was perceived and implemented in emergency dental records, according to organizational knowledge. Comparing these cases with previously analyzed concepts and indicators, we could predict that if we consider the concepts of the CIS (2004), R&D activities linked to this organizational innovation would not be counted in European research. The case illustrates some limitations still present in international studies, which ignore the role of services in relation to innovation and R&D. By neglecting the innovations related to the introduction of new planning techniques, processes management, adoption of indicators, etc.., very common in the service sector, as described by Djellal et al. (2003), R&D activities both in the service sector and the industrial sector are not measured. This issue corroborates the works by Miles (2007) on the difficulty of recognizing organizational R&D, and the activities of social research and design. However, continues the author, this type of R&D has become increasingly important because of the internationalization of markets and the need for public-private partnerships. It is important to notice that Eurostat (2008, p. 85), in finding the deficiencies related to the exclusion of R&D as an input for organizational or market innovations, observes: \"Among other things, the next CIS should contribute to a better understanding of the \"non-technical\" aspects of innovation, such as management techniques, organisational change, design and marketing issues\". Thus, it is expected an evolution both in research and in the results from the service sector. Recognizing the fact that organizational innovations are a reality in services, besides suggesting the inclusion of SSH in international researches, the cases analyzed in French hospitals allow us to suggest that activities that favor the dissemination of knowledge of the organization might be R&D indicators for the services sector. Thus, we recommend that investments in education, spread of manuals, routines and protocols are considered in the statistics. It is important to highlight that, as discussed in previous sections, the difficulty of measuring R&D and innovation in SSH is linked to the intangibility of the product of service, especially in this area of knowledge. Thus, as illustrated by the cases presented, indicators that deal with material components are not sufficient to evaluate the efforts of R&D and innovation in the sector. Components related to intangible knowledge, on the other hand, as those linked to efforts to generate and increase the stock of knowledge on methods and / or processes, as well as on the relationships necessary to complement the knowledge are necessary for innovation, are difficult to be measured. Six services depended particularly on knowledge from the natural sciences and engineering, though not exclusively. As an example, it is cited the development of software SIGAPS at the CHRU of Lille. The SIGAPS is a bibliometric tool created in 2004 to record the number of scientific publications of a researcher and a research team or institution. In 2006 the Department of Health decided to implement a charging system for research, based on the productivity of institutions; and SIGAPS was chosen (in a national competition) to be installed in the whole country. In 2006 the software needed to be modified in order to receive and consolidate data and national results. Among the skills sought to develop the program and make the necessary modifications, are the skills of computer and statistical competencies. The team sought knowledge in literature, besides using the information technology medical laboratory of the University. Furthermore, when implementing the program in the institutions, three interlocutors were designated as administrators of the SIGAPS in the institution (client), which facilitates the exchange of constant knowledge regarding new applications. Also, there was an exchange of knowledge between the hospital and the provider of the bibliometric indicators (Thomson Reuters), as well as the company that makes the installation and maintenance of software within the hospitals. The illustration of the results allows us to indicate that the generation and increase of the stock of knowledge, in creating new or different services is a reality, both in the SSH and the NSE. However, it is important to call attention to include them in the SSH international research. Although the major European researches had already clearly adopted this scientific field, other countries, like Japan, for instance, do not consider it (Eurostat, 2008). Also, as we saw, even though the BRDIS (2008) presents some caveats, there is a significant development when compared to the old survey. The examination of innovations verified in hospital services confirms that most services are part of the field of SSH. In the analyzed cases, few were the services created or modified due to the development or adoption of technological innovations. Such results confirm the difficulty in defining the service product and the diversity of actors who interact informally which limit the industrialist indicators proposed by the Frascati Manual (OECD, 2002). Because of the diversity of sources of knowledge that serve as base to these cases, some different indicators to R&D funding, can be suggested, such as: investments in books, subscription of journals, technical visits, and partnerships. Also, investments in educational programs and campaigns of knowledge dissemination on the organization may be measured; as well as the investments in communication technology to promote contacts between the different actors."}, {"section_title": "Diversity of actors and the inexistence of a specific R&D department", "text": "As previously seen, the relationship producer / supplier -consumer / customer and the fact that the production is contiguous to the consumer are quite well known in the literature of services. But as demonstrated by Vargas (2006), several actors can act in the development of innovation in services. In this sense, our investigation pervades the analysis of the different actors that contributed to the generation and increase the stock of knowledge to the development of innovations within hospital services. Thus, it will be possible to examine how the concepts and international indicators can cover the diversity of actors participating in the activities of R&D services. The changes in the sterilization service of Hospital Robert-Debr\u00e9 of AP-HP is an example of a number of actors involved in the generation of knowledge for the development of innovations. After an audit, it was recommended that the sterilization service was transferred to the pharmacy service. To start providing the services, the pharmacy organized project that was conducted by a multidisciplinary team of different actors: surgeons, nurses from the surgical ward and sterilization, sterilization agents, and pharmacists. The surgeons participated in the validation of the boxes compositions of the surgery ward. It enabled the definition of the amount of materials and tools to be prepared in the surgery boxes. The nurses were the formerly in charge of the service. Thus, they were in charge of the training of sterilization agents, with an external training provider. Since the pharmacists were in charge of the service, they put a lot of efforts to organize it. Papers and experiences exchanged among colleagues and speeches from the French Sterilization Congress were important sources of research and knowledge. These relationships illustrate the completion of R&D efforts among the actors, as said by Tether (2002), through the generation and increase of the stock of knowledge of different actors. Moreover, the transfer was supported by the management department and the president of the Medical Commission which complied with the audit recommendations and authorized the changes proposed by the pharmacy in order to improve productivity and quality of service. Regarding R&D personnel, according to the R&D indicators presented in the previous section, due to the generation and increase the stock of knowledge, only pharmacists could be considered as staff employed directly on R&D. Even so, they would not be professionals specialized in R&D, with no positions designating such status, but performed R&D activities in a specific project, which is: to conduct the changes in the service of sterilization. In the same characteristics could be included surgeons and nurses, who contributed in knowledge generation, in an interactive way and with the participation of the client (surgeons and nurses of the ward), as described by Djellal et al (2003), resulting in the presented innovation. These particularities, com-mon to almost all other cases composing our research, and well determined by Miles (2007), did not allow R&D to be accounted. It is interesting to notice, however, that R&D personnel statistics seems to advance. The old American survey was restricted to the accounting for scientists and engineers involved in R&D (SIRD, 2007, p.7), which certainly would exclude from R&D statistics great part of the staff involved in our research. With regard to BRDIS (2008), R&D employees indicators are broader, like the other surveys analyzed here. However, certain impasse seems to persist when the inclusion of the name \"R&D\", determining the staff employed, when the concept of R&D itself does not fully apply to the services or SSH. BRDIS (2008) questions R&D agreements regarding the management of relationships specifically on management of expenditure strategies with R&D. Although there is no indication as to the formality of contracts, the definition presented and the questions seem to refer to formal contracts for R&D. According to BRDIS (2008, p.24) R&D agreements means the involvement of \"two or more parties pooling resources and expertise to undertake R&D and share in any resulting intellectual property. R&D agreements involve shared risk and shared reward\". Although it seems to deal with formal contracts, it is interesting to notice that one of the issues is related to the definition of the type of partner. In this sense, the options \u00ab Customers, Vendors / suppliers and Competitors \u00bb and the many items of the survey that are improved in the attempt of further elucidate the types of relationships with the research, seem to extend the possibilities of relationships considered as part of R&D. This limitation seems to hold correspondence with the actors involved in the process of innovation in services (competitors, customers, public sector, and suppliers), presented by Sundbo and Gallouj (1998). To deal with this great sort of actors involved in R&D, the existence of indicators that enable the identification and measurement of the efforts that increase the stock of knowledge related to the management of the relationships might be interesting. Based on our results, we can suggest that the investments in satisfaction polls and information and communication technologies means may be used as R&D indicators in services. The advances allow the recognition of different relationships at the same time that the boundaries of R&D activities in services are expanded, allowing a better measurement of the sector results. However, while there are many actors (internal and external) that may be involved in the production of services and, consequently, their R&D activities and innovations, it seems to be recurrent the need to set up organizational barriers to such dynamics. It is difficult to establish a department in which it is possible to allocate the costs of equipment, materials, infrastructure, and personnel. It happens due to the fact that R&D is carried out by many actors, located in different departments that are not specialized in that activity. At university hospitals in Brazil, Bohrer and Vargas (2009) identified innovations resulting from the generation and increase of the stock of knowledge from various actors and departments that did not have R&D as the main activity. In the cases we analyzed, only two innovations had formal relationship with research projects, in these cases PHRC. Only the doctors in charge of these services would be designated as \"researchers\", which is not a condition to characterize a \"research unit\" or \"research department\". One of them was the Service for Magnetic Stimulation (SMS) and the other, the Neurovascular Emergency Service, both from AP-HM. The generation of knowledge to create the SMS occurred in different departments, through multiple actors: different medical service, but also the Medical Association of SMS and the equipment supplier, which would involve other sites in the analysis in question. Considering such results, it is interesting to consider the suggestion by Miles (2007, p.256-7): \"Instead of asking about whether staff engage in R&D, a survey could ask about whether they engage in creative work undertaken on a systematic basis in order to increase the stock of knowledge\u2026 [etc.]. While more cumbersome, this would remove the terminological barrier that appears to exist between the content of the construct as perceived by surveyor and surveyed\". In the second case, the doctor idealized and implemented the service without the technical and scientific collaboration of other actors, since he had extensive knowledge in many areas of the service, as well as internationally recognized competence in the subject. This would be the only case, among the thirty-five analyzed, in which the innovation was developed within the limits of what we might call a \"department of R&D\". This \"department\" would consist of a single researcher (from the neurology service), even if the researcher does not have research as his main activity, but the medical and hospital care, as the chief doctor of the unit. Moreover, the findings confirm what was described by Djellal et al (2003) that the \"marginal R&D\" is more common in services than \"core R&D\" meaning that R&D is usually carried out informally in units for which it is not the main activity. To attend to these characteristics, we suggested some indicators that might deal with the informality of the R&D personnel in services: publications of the research group, publications of professionals, number of trainees or bachelors\" researchers, among others."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Considering the particularities of the service sector and the concepts and indicators of the main surveys analyzed, this paper aimed to present some of the advances and limitations of research in services. Then, the cases analyzed in the university hospitals have shown that R&D activities in services do not follow any conventional pattern. The empirical results showed that great part of the service activities fit the SSH and because of the immateriality of its products and inadequacies on the concepts and indicators, some loses to the sector statistics may be logical. The analysis of the case studies in the French university hospitals allows us to envisage that the generation and increase of the stock of knowledge in services goes beyond those reported in the material component. The knowledge generation related to different methods and/or processes is usual in the analyzed cases. Also, the R&D related to relational operations was important to a good connection among the many actors involved in the conception of services. One of the indicators used to evaluate R&D activities is R&D employees. Regarding to this indicator, we verified a diversity of actors who contributed to the generation and increase of the stock of knowledge, necessary to create or modify the services in the analyzed hospitals. The results corroborate the literature, highlighting that just one of thirty-four interviewees charged of innovations was considered a researcher or had any period of the day dedicated exclusively to formal research activities. Thus, there was an inadequacy of one of the main indicators of R&D proposed by the Manual (OECD, 2002) and most of the researches based on strict concepts. In order to supplant this difficulty, we suggested some indicators that might deal with the informality of the R&D personnel in services. Concerning R&D funding, we noticed that not always R&D in services is planned through a formal project. Then the measurement of R&D expenses and funding is not always a compulsory process or an easy task. However, the mobilization of theoretical, practical, organizational, and relational competencies might reveal a series of other useful indicators to services. Investments in books, subscription of journals, technical visits, and partnerships are some suggestions. Also, investments in educational programs and campaigns of knowledge dissemination on the organization may be measured; as well as the investments in communication technology to promote the contacts between the different actors. The feasibility of expanding R&D indicators by the suggestion of measuring forms that are related to non-material inputs seems to contribute to the improvement of statistics related to R&D in services. At the same time, the possibility of considering informal projects and researchers widens the scope and allows the inclusion of a net of actors that might interact and contribute with R&D, especially in services. This expanded vision of R&D indicators in services seems to be capable of changing the identification and measurement of such activities. However, the proposals made might not be valid for other sectors. It is suggested that the indicators should be applied and tested in non-university hospitals, which in general do not have a so fruitful knowledge production as the university hospitals analyzed, being possible to reach divergent results."}]
