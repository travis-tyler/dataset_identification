[{"section_title": "FOOD INSECURITY ACROSS THE FIRST FIVE YEARS: TRIGGERS OF ONSET AND EXIT: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY", "text": "In 2011, 1.0 percent of households with children experienced very low food security among children, indicating that children themselves were hungry or went without food (Coleman-Jensen et al., 2012) . Although the prevalence of very low food security among children can be viewed as low, the short-and long-term consequences cannot be overlooked, particularly during early childhood. Still, little is known about the patterns of very low food security among young children. This study addresses this gap in the literature by examining the predictors of the entry into and exit from very low food security over the first five years of life.\nSpecifically, the two primary research aims of this study are the following: (1) Understand the triggers or shocks that explain movements into or out of very low food security among children from birth to age five, and (2) Examine the first aim using different definitions of food insecurity, including low and very low food security among children, very low food security among adults and children, and low and very low food security among adults and children.\nThe analysis relies on data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort (ECLS-B), a longitudinal, nationally representative dataset of approximately 10,700 births in 2001, which followed children from birth to kindergarten entry. Data used in this study were collected when children were nine months, two years, four years, and at kindergarten entry-the first four of the five waves of data. Information on food insecurity from the 18-item Core Food Security Module (CFSM) and a rich set of variables on child, maternal, and household characteristics were collected at each time point. The ECLS-B also includes zip codes, which allows the data to be merged with county-level contextual variables such as the rates of poverty, unemployment, and participation in food assistance programs.\nUsing an analysis sample of 18,950 transitions between waves of data, this study tests the hypothesis that events or changes in child, maternal, and household circumstances affect the likelihood of entry into and exit from very low food security among children (Aim 1) by estimating two linear probability models. In the first model, which investigates the entry into very low food security, children who transitioned into very low food security between waves of data are compared to those who were food secure in both waves. In the second model, which examines the exit from food insecurity, children who transitioned out of very low food security between waves of data are compared to children who experienced very low food security in both waves. For Aim 2, these same models were estimated using different definitions of food insecurity."}, {"section_title": "Graph 1. Percentage of Transitions Entering and Exiting Food Insecurity", "text": "Note: Sample size is 18,950 transitions.\nDescriptive analysis in Graph 1 provides an overview of the percent of the baseline sample experiencing transitions in food insecurity status. Not surprisingly, a very small percentage of the transitions represent children moving into very low food security or out of very low food security. As expected, a larger percentage of transitions involve movements into low or very low food security or out of low or very low food security. By comparison, household-level food security status changed more often in the transitions between waves than child-level food security.\nRegression results suggest that residential moves and declines in maternal or child health are associated with transitioning into food insecurity, whereas increases in the number of adults in the household are associated with exits from food insecurity. Changes in income and maternal depression are associated with both entrances and exits. These findings are robust to different definitions of food insecurity and model specifications. Findings can help nutrition assistance programs target parents and their children for assistance and information on coping strategies when they are most at risk of experiencing food insecurity."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "In 2011, 14.9 percent of households in the United States were classified as food insecure (Coleman-Jensen et al., 2012) , defined as \"having limited or uncertain availability of food, or limited or uncertain ability to acquire acceptable foods in socially acceptable ways\" 1 (Skalicky et al., 2006) . Of these food-insecure households, more than one-third (5.7% of all households in the U.S.) experienced very low food security (Coleman-Jensen et al., 2012) . Very low food security is more severe than low food security, and can entail reduced food intake and disrupted eating patterns. While children are typically protected from food need, 9.0 percent of households with children were classified as experiencing low food security among children and 1.0 percent of all households with children experienced very low food security among children, meaning that children themselves did not have adequate food (Coleman-Jensen et al., 2012) .\nAlthough the prevalence of food insecurity among children can be viewed as low, the consequences cannot be overlooked, especially with regard to food insecurity experienced during the early childhood period. Even when children themselves do not experience hunger, their parents' experiences of food insecurity pose serious threats to children's physical, behavioral, and cognitive development, mediated through parental stress or depression (see Nord [2009] for a comprehensive review of this literature). Young children who live in food-insecure households are more likely to experience fair or poor health (Bronte-Tinkew et al., 2007; Cook et al., 2004; , are more likely to have been hospitalized since birth (Cook et al., 2004; , and exhibit more behavioral problems, including aggressiveness, hyperactivity, depression, and anxiety (Whitaker, Phillips, & Orzel, 2006) than their counterparts in food-secure households.\n1 Food insecurity measures both the quality and quantity of food based on an 18-item scale developed by the USDA. The scale captures experiences at the household level (in the last 12 months), such as running out of food, perceptions that food in a household is of inadequate quality or quantity, and reduced food intake by adults or children, all because of financial constraints (Bickel et al., 2000) . The scale assesses food insecurity as \"low food security\" and \"very low food security\". For more information see Coleman-Jensen et al. (2012) .\nPresumably, the health consequences of directly experiencing food insecurity in terms of lack of food are more severe than the indirect effects via parent stress or other household processes. Furthermore, the health consequences of food insecurity are likely to be more severe when experienced during early childhood, as opposed to older ages, as developmental psychology theory and research emphasize the importance of early experiences for children's physical, cognitive, and social-emotional development (e.g., Bronfenbrenner & Morris, 1998; Shonkoff & Phillips, 2000) . For example, Shonkoff and Phillips (2000) suggest that nutritional deficiency during infancy can lead to impaired brain development. Because of these consequences, this study focuses on food insecurity directly experienced by children from birth to five years of age.\nDespite the severe and long-lasting consequences of food insecurity, little is known about the factors related to child-level food insecurity, especially among young children. This study uses a nationally-representative, longitudinal dataset, the Early Childhood Longitudinal StudyBirth Cohort (ECLS-B), to examine the triggers or shocks that contribute to the onset of and exit from very low food security among young children. Triggers examined include changes in employment, income, household composition, child health, maternal mental and physical health, and residential moves. Specifically, the two primary research aims of this study are.\n1) Understand the triggers or shocks that explain movements into or out of very low food security among children from birth to age five.\n2) Examine the first aim using different definitions of food insecurity, including low and very low food security among children, very low food security among adults and children, and low and very low food security among adults and children.\nBy understanding the triggers of very low food security, food assistance and other public programs can better target resources to serve the families most at risk or most in need; likewise, policies can be improved to build upon identified predictors that help lift children out of food insecurity."}, {"section_title": "BACKGROUND", "text": "The limited research on the factors related to child-level food insecurity experienced during early childhood, which focuses on children of all ages and uses varying definitions of food insecurity, indicates that household income, employment, and education level, which are indicators of families' social and economic resources, are important predictors. Approximately one-quarter (24.1%) of U.S. households below the poverty line had food-insecure children (Coleman-Jensen et al., 2012) . Households classified as food insecure are less likely to have health insurance (Gundersen & Gruber, 2001) , and food-insecure households with children are more likely to be mother-headed, have more children, and average lower education among adults than their food-secure counterparts (Bartfeld & Dunifon, 2006) . In 2007, about half (55%) of households with food-insecure children had no adult with any education beyond the high school level; among households with children experiencing very low food security, 59 percent had no adult members with more than a high school degree (Nord, 2009 ). However, employment and higher income do not guarantee food security. More than two-thirds (69%) of households with children classified as having low food security had one or more persons employed full-time; 62 percent of children with very low food security lived in households with one or more persons employed full-time (Nord, 2009) .\nWhile several studies document the correlates of food insecurity, less is known about why children themselves enter or exit food insecurity -that is, what factors, events, or \"shocks\" trigger the onset of or exit from food insecurity among young children. Understanding these factors is important because food insecurity tends to be episodic rather than chronic (ColemanJensen et al., 2012) ; thus, changes in food insecurity status are likely frequent among young children living in low-resourced families. Further, these predictors of very low food security among young children may be different from those associated with the food insecurity of older children and adults. For example, the effect of maternal depression on school-age children's food insecurity may be mitigated by the receipt of school breakfast or lunch; however, young children, who receive more of their nutritional intake from their families, may be negatively affected by maternal depression as it may impede a mother's ability to purchase and prepare food.\nRelevant to understanding triggers of changes in food insecurity status, poverty research indicates that changes in employment, family composition, parent or child health, and receipt of public programs predict entry or exit from poverty (e.g., Blank, 1997; Chen & Corak, 2008; Lichter, Qian, & Melliot, 2006) . Indeed, previous research suggests that unexpected losses in income, particularly among low-income families, create budget constraints that render households susceptible to food insecurity (Gundersen & Gruber, 2001) . Similarly, parental job loss, divorce, the birth of a child, or unexpected health expenses may place greater strain on families' economic resources. Conversely, a parent's entry into the labor force, income increases, marriage or union formation, or improvements in health may help lift children and their families out of food insecurity."}, {"section_title": "METHODLOGY", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "ECLS-B", "text": "The ECLS-B is a longitudinal dataset collected by the National Center for Education Given the broad motivations of the ECLS-B, these data are rich and appropriate for this study. 4 The ECLS-B is the only longitudinal dataset of young children that contains the full 18-item U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Core Food Security Module (CFSM) in every wave of data collection. The use of a dataset that includes the CFSM allows for comparisons of results with other studies and an exploration of the research aims at multiple levels of food insecurity. The very low food security rate among children generated using the first wave of data from the ECLS-B is remarkably similar to that generated using the Current Population Survey Wellbeing Study. The ECLS-B also contains a rich set of variables on child, maternal, and household characteristics.

Given that the dependent variables are binary, linear probability models are appropriate. 6 Separate regression models predicting entry into and exit from very low food security are estimated instead of one regression model with child fixed-effects to determine if factors that influence entry into and exit from very low food security are different as suggested by the finding in Heflin and Butler (in press ) that different factors predict entry into and exit from material hardship. Hazard models are not used because children can move in and out of states over the four waves of data collection and the data are not collected at consistent intervals.\nThe dependent variables capture experiences of food insecurity over the past 12 months using the 18-question CFSM. Ten questions correspond to the experiences of the household and adults, while the remaining questions focus on the children. Questions ask respondents about their experiences over the past 12 months regarding their food purchases, consumption, and concerns (e.g., whether they were worried their food would run out before they had money to buy more, whether they cut the size of or skip their own or their children's meals because there wasn't enough money to buy food). From these questions, a raw score, a scale score, and a categorical measure of food security at the following three levels are generated: household food security, adult food security, and child food security. 7 For each level of food security, a household, adult, or child is classified as being food secure, having low food security, or having very low food security. 8 To address the study aims, this analysis relies on the food security categorical variables for children and households where child-level food insecurity captures whether a child in the household is experiencing the condition and household-level captures whether any member of the household (adult and/or child) is experiencing the condition.\nThe first dependent variable is a binary variable for which those who enter very low food security (from any food security status) are coded as \"1\" and those who are food secure or have low food security in both waves are coded as \"0\". Essentially, the entry model includes only those who were food secure or had low food security in the first wave of the transition. Those transitions that experienced very low food security in the subsequent wave were coded \"1\" and those that remained low food secure or food secure were a \"0\". The second dependent variable is a binary variable representing those who exit from very low food security (to any food security status), who are coded as \"1\", compared to those who experience very low food security in both waves and are coded as \"0\". Therefore, the exit model includes only those transitions that experienced very low food security in the first wave. Those transitions that remained very low food secure in the subsequent wave were coded as a \"0\" and those that became food secure or experienced low food security were coded as a \"1\". See Appendix Table 1 for a detailed explanation of these variables and other variables used in the analysis.\nThe vector X includes factors that trigger entry into very low food security or exit from 7 The raw scores are the number of questions answered affirmatively (i.e., yes; often or sometimes; almost every month or some months but not every month). The scale score is a Rasch transformation of the raw score. See Ohls, Radbill, and Schirm (2001) for more information. The household-level variables are calculated according to Bickel et al. (2000) , and the child-level variables are calculated according to Nord and Bickel (2002) . 8 Note that the ECLS-B refers to these categories as food secure, food insecure without hunger, and food insecure with hunger. The above terms are used in accordance with the National Academies of Sciences recommendation (Wunderlich & Norwood, 2006) . very low food security among children from birth to age five, focusing on multiple levels of children's environments. The analyses focus on child-, maternal-, and household-level factors that change, with an emphasis on those identified as influencing transitions into and out of poverty. Specifically, triggers that capture a change in resources, resources needed, or the ability to manage resources are examined. Changes in these characteristics are calculated for the transitions between each of the four waves of data collection used in this study (9 months and 2, 4, and 5 years). Although there are a few years between each wave of data collection, previous research demonstrates that economic and household changes can have long-lasting impacts on food security (e.g., Gundersen & Gruber, 2001) . When predicting entry into very low food security, we include \"negative events\" experienced by the household as predictors for entry into very low food security as we hypothesize that negative events or changes in circumstances such as job loss will predict the onset of very low food security. Conversely, when examining exit from very low food security, \"positive events\" are included in the models. Three of the events in the models (change in employment status, health, and depression) are asked of the survey respondent, but are attributed to the mother in this analysis because 96.5 percent of the interviews were conducted with the biological or adoptive mothers of the sampled children.\nThe first trigger examines change in maternal employment status, as reported by survey respondents, with the following four variables representing this event: became employed, became unemployed and exited the labor force, became unemployed and remained in the labor force, and employment status remained the same. To code these variables, the mother's selfreported job status in one wave is compared with that in the next wave, and binary variables representing the change are generated. Moving to unemployment is divided into two categories to distinguish between those who are not looking for work (e.g., stay-at-home mothers) and those who are. Becoming employed is considered a positive event, as it represents the introduction of more resources, and becoming unemployed is considered a negative event as it results in a household having fewer resources.\nThe next triggers capture how changes in household composition influence the entry into and exit from very low food security: a change in the number of adults aged 18 years or older in the household, and a change in the number of children under 18 years living in the household, as\nreported by respondents at each wave. Both of these events are represented by the following three binary variables: number increased, number decreased, and number remained the same. An increase in the number of adults and decrease in the number of children is considered a positive event as an additional adult could represent more resources for the family, whereas an additional child will consume more resources. In contrast, decreases in the number of adults and increases in the number of children are considered negative events.\nNext, how changes in household income influence food security is investigated. At each wave, respondents reported the bracket that included their total household income, capturing resources for all adults. Brackets were measured in $5,000 intervals for income under $40,000 (e.g., $0-$5,000, $5,001-$10,000, and $10,001-$15,000) and were much larger for higher incomes (e.g., $75,001-$100,000, $100,001-$200,000 and $200,001 or more). Like changes in household composition, this trigger is coded as three binary variables: income increased, decreased, or remained the same. Increasing income is considered a positive event and decreasing income is considered a negative event. This income variable is also used to approximate the household's FPL level at each wave.\nAlso examined is whether improvements or declines in the mother's or child's physical health over time predicts the onset of or exit from very low food security. The predictor is derived from the question asking the respondent to rate her general health and her child's general health as excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor. Changes between waves in both of these general health variables are coded as health improved, health declined, or health remained the same. An improvement in health is considered a positive event, as an improvement in maternal health facilitates maternal employment and an improvement in child health requires less household resources. In contrast, a decline in health is considered a negative event.\nRelated to health, whether maternal depression triggers entry into or exit from very low food security is investigated. Maternal depression was measured from mothers' responses to a modified version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D; Radloff, 1977) at 9 months, preschool, and kindergarten entry and using the Depression Scale of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview Short Form (CIDI-SF; Kessler et al., 2003) at 2 years. Consistent with other research using the modified 12-item CES-D, we considered those with moderate or severe symptoms (a raw score greater than 9) to be depressed. The CIDI-SF was originally created for the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) using questions from the full CIDI, an instrument used internationally in cross-cultural epidemiological studies of mental disorders. Only the depression questions were included in the ECLS-B. Whereas the CIDI-SF asks about the participants' experience over the previous 12 months, the questions were revised to ask about the period since the previous interview in the ECLS-B. The CIDI-SF uses a stembranch logic in which individuals are first asked 3 stem questions pertaining to their feelings of dysphoria and its persistence. If respondents deny symptoms or the persistence of symptoms, they are considered as not a having major depressive disorder; if an individual responds affirmatively to at least one stem question, they are asked 7 additional branch questions about other symptoms including losing interest, difficulty sleeping, changes in weight, trouble concentrating, feeling down, and thoughts about death. Consistent with previous studies using the CIDI-SF, mothers who reported an affirmative answer to one of the stem questions were considered moderately or severely depressed. Becoming depressed is considered a negative event, as depressed mothers may need more resources, be less able to manage resources, and be less likely to be employed. Recovering from depression is considered a positive event.\nFinally, whether household residential moves predict changes in children's food security is tested. This variable is based on a question asking the respondent if they moved since the last interview, and is coded as a household moved residences compared to a household did not move.\nWhile moving is a stressful event for children, if a child moves to a better neighborhood with better schools, lower poverty, improved access to food, or a lower crime rate, it has positive implications and thus predicts exit from food insecurity. Hence, the effect of moving on entry into and exit from very low food security is ambiguous.\nIn addition to the triggers explained above, regression models include additional, childlevel variables (Z) including binary variables representing that the child is female, race/ethnicity, and part of a multiple birth. Child race/ethnicity is coded as a series of binary variables including child is non-Hispanic White (reference), child is non-Hispanic Black, child is Hispanic, and child is other race/ethnicity. An indicator variable for whether the child is part of a multiple birth is included as the ECLS-B oversamples twins and being part of a multiple birth may influence transitions into and out of very low food security. Finally, binary variables for each transition in the model to capture age and year effects of the child are included, with the final transition (between waves 3 and 4) being the reference category.\nDescriptive statistics and regression estimates from the linear probability models are not weighted because the ECLS-B dataset is transformed with the unit of analysis being the transition between waves, and an appropriate weight is not provided. Standard errors of the regression coefficients are adjusted to account for multiple observations for the same child. For Aim 2, the Aim 1 analyses are re-estimated using the following three additional definitions of food insecurity: very low or low food security among children, very low food security among children and adults, and very low or low food security among children and adults."}, {"section_title": "Analysis Sample", "text": "The baseline analysis sample represents 7,850 children who resided in a household with income at or below 300 percent of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL; $60,000 for a family of 4 in 2006) at some point during the first four waves. 9 In other words, if household income at any wave is at or below 300 percent of the FPL, then the child remains in the sample. In contrast, if a child resides in a household with income above 300 percent of FPL for every wave, then the child is excluded from the analysis. In the case of missing income information, if all non-missing income values are above 300 percent of FPL, the child is excluded from the sample; otherwise, the child is included. A large number of children (4,050) with missing data in at least one of the first four waves remain in the sample because low-income households tend to be less likely to report income and to preserve sample size. 10 The analysis sample is broadly defined because many food-insecure children live well above the poverty line; 0.2 percent of households above 185 percent of the FPL contain children who are considered as having very low food security, and 8.0 percent of households with children above 185 percent of the FPL contain adults or children classified as food insecure (Coleman-Jensen et al., 2012) . In total, 2,850 children are excluded from the sample because they do not meet the income-related criteria.\n9 Income and household size from the ECLS-B and Census Bureau thresholds are used to determine whether a household is at or below 300 percent of the FPL. Because the ECLS-B provides income ranges, each child is assigned the midpoint of the range. This midpoint is compared to three times the FPL based on household size for the first year of each wave. 10 Results (available upon request) excluding these children missing income are qualitatively similar to those presented.\nGiven that our research questions seek to identify the predictors of entry into and exit from food insecurity, the unit of analysis is the transition of a sampled child from one wave to "}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Descriptive Statistics", "text": "Tables 2A and 2B describe characteristics of children who entered into and exited from very low food security themselves, and who resided in households who entered into and exited from very low food security, respectively. Because the triggers for movement into and out of very low food security among children and very low food security among all members of the household follow similar patterns, the results are discussed together. Compared to the full sample, becoming unemployed, experiencing a decline in income, and experiencing a decrease in the number of adults in the household between data collection waves are more common among those who moved into very low food security. A decline in both child and maternal health are associated with moving into food insecurity along with maternal depression. Finally, a change in residence is associated with moving into food insecurity. The opposing set of triggers (i.e., the opposite or positive changes in these variables) predict exits from food insecurity, with a couple of notable exceptions: a decrease in the number of children and an increase in the number of adults in the household each predict exits from food insecurity."}, {"section_title": "Regression Analysis", "text": "Addressing Aims 1 and 2, Table 3 shows results from linear probability models predicting entrance into different levels and definitions of food insecurity. The results in Column 1 address the onset of very low food security at the child-level. Triggers that predict this transition include maternal health declines, the onset of maternal depression, and a change in residence. Turning to the models predicting entry into other forms of food insecurity (Columns 2 through 4), a decrease in income, the onset of maternal depression, and a change in residence consistently predict the onset of food insecurity. Interestingly, maternal health declines are only associated with movement into very low food security at the child-and household-level, although the coefficients are small in magnitude. Other triggers that appear to be important in predicting movement into low or very low food security among the household include a decrease in the number of adults, child health declines, and becoming unemployed and remaining in the labor force. It is possible that these factors are important in predicting movement into very low food security among children, in particular, but the sample size of children experiencing very low food security is too small to detect significant effects. Table 4 provides the results predicting exit from different forms of food insecurity from positive triggers or events. The only trigger that predicts a transition out of very low food security among children is a decrease in the number of children. It is likely that other factors are important in explaining this transition; however, it may be that the sample size is too small to detect significant effects. The sample used in the exit regression is smaller than that of the entry regression because fewer transitions are eligible to move out of very low food security. In the models that predict exit from other definitions of food insecurity (Columns 2 through 4), an increase in the number of adults residing in the household is statistically significant in each\nmodel. An increase in income and an exit from maternal depression are also consistently significant in each model. In contrast to the entry models, a change in residence does not predict movement out of food insecurity.\nThe control variables included in the models are consistent with findings in other studies.\nBeing non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic are associated with movements into and out of food insecurity compared to being non-Hispanic White. Although not as consistent, being an other race/ethnicity is also related to movements into and out of food insecurity."}, {"section_title": "Additional Analyses", "text": "Maternal depression, an important factor in both entry and exit models, warrants further investigation. Regression results suggest that becoming depressed or recovering from depression predicts movement into or out of food insecurity, respectively. However, these results must be interpreted cautiously, as it is not clear whether maternal depression is leading to food insecurity or mothers are becoming depressed because they are food insecure. Other studies such as Heflin and Ziliak (2008) have used fixed effects models to attempt to estimate a causal effect of maternal depression on food insufficiency. However, given the structure of the analysis sample, such models are not possible to run. To further understand the relationship between maternal depression and food insecurity and establish a temporal order between the two variables, a lagged model for maternal depression is estimated, testing whether changes in maternal depression are antecedent or subsequent to changes in food insecurity. The results from these models (available upon request) are similar to the entry models in Table 3 , but there is no consistent influence of exiting depression in the previous time period on exiting food insecurity.\nChange in residence is also a predictor of entry into food insecurity. To identify the characteristics of moves that correspond with entrance into food insecurity, data were collected Many sensitivity analyses are estimated to determine the robustness of the main results.\nFirst, models are estimated to determine if the results are sensitive to using the categorical food security variables and examining the predictors of entry into and exit from food insecurity separately. To accomplish this, two models are estimated using the raw food insecurity scale scores at the child-and household-levels as the dependent variables. Further, the positive and negative triggers of food insecurity are jointly included in each model. Table 5 shows that the results from the main models are robust with several exceptions; change of residence and declines in child and maternal health no longer have statistically significant influences on entry 12 SNAP helps low-income households buy food they need for a nutritionally adequate diet. WIC provides food assistance, nutritional counseling, and health and social services referrals to low-income pregnant and post-partum women, infants, and young children.\ninto food insecurity.\nSecond, in additional analyses available from the authors, the definition of food insecurity is changed to include those who are marginally food secure. Child-level marginal food security is defined as responding affirmatively to one of eight questions and household-level marginal food security is defined as responding affirmatively to one or two of 18 questions.\nFinally, the models are estimated among a sample of children in the ECLS-B whose parental respondent reported having a high school degree or less education, to ensure our results are not sensitive to one of the income-based inclusion criteria for the analysis sample. The results for both of these analyses are similar to those generated by the main models in Tables 3 and 4 ."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "This study investigated the triggers or shocks that explain the onset of and exit from food insecurity among young children. Results suggest that, as hypothesized, changes in income and maternal depression are consistently associated with transitioning into and out of food insecurity in the directions predicted. Declines in maternal and child health and residential moves are associated with entry into food insecurity, whereas increases in the number of adults in the household are associated with exits from food insecurity. These results are robust across different definitions of food insecurity, analysis samples, and model specification. Given that these are common household changes or events experienced by many young children, these findings have important implications for policy and future research.\nAs expected, changes in family income were consistently associated with changes in child-and household-level food insecurity. Increases in income result in more resources with which to purchase food; conversely, decreases in income lead to a tighter budget constraint.\nAlthough many low-income families are food secure, and many higher-income families are food insecure, income and family poverty are major predictors of food insufficiency and insecurity (e.g., Alaimo et al., 2001 ). Interestingly, after controlling for changes in income and maternal mental health, changes in employment status were not strongly related to changes in food insecurity, suggesting that the resources derived from employment, rather than the benefits of employment itself, are important for food insecurity. This result may be a consequence of the limited employment variable, which captures the work status of the respondent, who is typically the mother. Likewise, an increase in the number of adults in the household was important in lifting families out of food insecurity. An increase in the number of adults living in the home, whether they are a spouse, partner, or grandparent, may contribute to household income and, independent of income, may serve as an important source of child care, allowing parents to work or to work longer hours.\nChanges in maternal mental health appear particularly important to food insecurity.\nBuilding on previous research that has linked maternal depression with food insecurity (e.g., Laraia, Siega-Riz, Gundersen, & Dole, 2006) , this study identified associations between the onset of maternal depression and the onset of food insecurity; in turn, improvements in maternal depressive symptoms are associated with exit from food insecurity. Also consistent with hypotheses, declines in self-reported maternal and child health were related to the onset of food insecurity (although unlike maternal depression, improvements in health were not related to exits from food insecurity). Reductions in health may increase health care needs and expenses, and possibly affect parenting behaviors or parents' time, supplanting the resources typically used to purchase or prepare food. However, it is also possible that the onset of food insecurity leads to reductions in parent and child health. Unfortunately, this study is not able to assess timing or order of changes in mental and physical health and food insecurity or the causal directions of these relationships. Indeed, previous research indicates that the causal relationship between food insecurity and depression is bidirectional (Huddleston-Casas, Charnigo, & Simmons, 2009 ).\nMore research is needed to better understand the causal relationships between maternal depressive symptoms and child-and household-level food insecurity. Given the negative impact of food insecurity on multiple domains of children's development (e.g., Cummings & Davies, 1994; Grace, Evindar, & Stewart, 2003; Hay et al., 2003 , Gundersen et al., 2008 , and evidence that maternal depression mediates the relationship between food insecurity and some aspects of children's development (Bronte-Tinkew et al., 2007) , policies and programs that identify and treat maternal depression and other health problems early may have beneficial impacts on children's long-term health and development.\nInterestingly, residential mobility is associated with movement into but not out of food insecurity. Due to data limitations, we could not determine why a family moved -for positive reasons, such as to a bigger home or better school district, or for negative reasons, such as a divorce or home foreclosure. This finding builds on previous research that has primarily focused on the negative associations between residential instability and food security (Nord & Parker, 2010) . In our study, among children who moved counties and entered food insecurity, there were no clear differences in county-level characteristics (including poverty level, employment rate, and median income) between the first wave of the transition and the second. However, these analyses included a relatively small sample of children. Previous research has found that intrastate moves are more highly associated with food insecurity than inter-state moves (Tapogna et al., 2004) ; similarly, we found that intra-county moves drive the associations between residential moves and food insecurity. Further, earlier work suggests that families classified as high-or middle-income who experience food insecurity are disproportionately more likely to report residential moves, which may indicate that a substantial change in income or job loss occurred during the previous year that precipitated the move (Nord & Brent, 2002) . Our analysis sample of children at or below 300 percent FPL may exclude these children.\nSeveral limitations of this research should be acknowledged. First, because the CFSM asks about food insecurity among any child in the household and younger children tend to be protected, the sample child may not be the child experiencing food insecurity, but rather, the respondent may be referring to an older sibling. Second, given that so few children of this age group experience very low food security, it is difficult to detect statistically significant effects for this level of food insecurity. Third, caution should be used in interpreting the coefficients on maternal depression and changes in residence and health, as these changes may be a predictor or consequence of changes in food insecurity. Fourth, our independent and dependent variables were based on reliable, valid measures, but were self-reported; desirability bias or poor memory recall about respondents' food security situation, depressive symptoms, or other conditions could affect the validity of results. Finally, given the relatively long periods of time between data collection waves (e.g., two years between the two-year and preschool waves), we are unable to determine the timing or sequence of changes in family circumstances and food security. For example, we do not know whether an increase in income predated exit from food insecurity, or vice versa. This may underlie our findings regarding changes in public food assistance receipt and the onset of and exit from food insecurity, such that having started receiving food assistance is an indication that a family entered food insecurity, not that receiving food assistance predates food insecurity.\nDespite these limitations, these findings have important policy implications. Results will help nutrition assistance programs target parents and their children when they are most at risk of experiencing food insecurity, particularly those experiencing changes in family structure, maternal health, or residential mobility. Moreover, findings can help inform programs that provide parents with strategies to cope with food insecurity, particularly strategies that help treat parents' physical or mental health problems. child-level food security or low food security in previous wave and very low food security in current wave 0 = Respondent reports child-level food security or low food security in both the previous and current waves Child Level: Exited Very Low Food Security 1 = Respondent reports very low child-level food security in previous wave and food security or low food security in current wave 0 = Respondent reports very low child-level food security in both the current and previous waves Child Level: Entered Low or Very Low Food Security 1 = Respondent reports child-level food security in previous wave and low or very low food security in current wave 0 = Respondent reports child-level food security in both the previous wave and current waves Child Level: Exited Low or Very Low Food Security 1 = Respondent reports low or very low child-level food security in previous wave and food security in current wave 0 = Respondent reports child-level low or very low food security in both the previous wave and current waves Household Level: Entered Very Low Food Security 1 = Respondent reports household-level food security or low food security in previous wave and very low food security in current wave 0 = Respondent reports household-level food security or low food security in both the previous wave and current waves Household Level: Exited Very Low Food Security 1 = Respondent reports very low household-level food security in previous wave and food security or low food security in current wave 0 = Respondent reports household-level very low food security in both the previous wave and current waves Household Level: Entered Low or Very Low Food Security 1 = Respondent reports household-level food security in previous wave and low or very low food security in current wave 0 = Respondent reports household-level food security in both the previous wave and current waves Household Level: Exited Low or Very Low Food Security 1 = Respondent reports low or very low household-level food security in previous wave and food security in current wave 0 = Respondent reports household-level very low food security in both the previous wave and current waves Predictors Mother Became Employed 1 = Mother had no job in previous wave but has a job (or multiple jobs) in current wave 0 = Mother lost job or job status has not changed since previous wave Mother Became Unemployed 1 = Mother had a job (or multiple jobs) in previous wave but has no job in current wave 0 = Mother got a job or job status has not changed since previous wave Increase in # of Adults 1 = Number of adults (18+) in the household has increased since previous wave 0 = Number of adults in the household has decreased or stayed the same since previous wave Decrease in # of Adults 1 = Number of adults (18+) in the household has decreased since previous wave 0 = Number of adults in the household has increased or stayed the same since previous wave "}, {"section_title": "Appendix", "text": ""}]
