[{"section_title": "Background", "text": "During the past two years, the UCAR Board of Trustees and other members of the UCAR university community have become increasingly concerned about an apparent drop in the number, and perhaps quality, of students applying for graduate school. University participants in the 1999 UCAR Forum on the future of the atmospheric sciences concluded that there was serious problem regarding the quantity and quality of students entering the atmospheric and related sciences (including oceanography, space science and earth science) 2 . In the subsequent UCAR survey of broad issues that was conducted during June and July of 2000, the issue of quantity and quality of graduate students received more comments than any other . Apparently many university departments around the world are experiencing similar difficulties recruiting highly skilled students in the environmental sciences (Brasseur, 2000). Anecdotal evidence suggests that this decline has led to increased competition nationally for good students, a shortfall of graduate students to assist in teaching, and a smaller pool of students to contribute to the university research efforts. If the decrease is real and continues, the number of Ph.D. graduates could be insufficient to meet national needs in the near future. To gain a more objective view of the situation, we conducted a survey of UCAR universities and investigated other statistical data related to the issue of future human resources at the Ph.D. level. In order to limit the scope of the study, we focused primarily on Ph.D graduates and to a lesser extent on MS graduates. This article presents the results of the UCAR survey and what these and other demographic data imply for meeting the needs for university teachers and researchers in atmospheric sciences in the coming years. This 'pipeline issue' is a vital one for any discipline and to our knowledge there have been no recent studies of this issue within the atmospheric science community. The goal of the web-based UCAR survey on graduate enrollment was to collect information on recent trends in the quantity and quality of students entering graduate programs in atmospheric sciences. We asked UCAR Member institutions to report enrollment data over the past five years. While five years constitute a short time scale for such a study, we deemed it preferable to request data that are relatively easy to access, and to thereby assure that a large number of institutions would participate."}, {"section_title": "Graduate enrollment survey results", "text": "The questionnaire was posted on the web in April 2000 and requested data on graduate student enrollments from the 1995/1996 academic year to 1999/2000. We asked for the numbers of students applying, the number admitted, the number that actually entered the program and the GRE scores of the admitted students. The latter were broken into two groups, those with and without financial support. In addition, we asked respondents to rate on a scale of 1-5 how significant they felt this graduate enrollment problem to be, with 1 being insignificant and 5 being very significant. We received responses from 36 out of 63 institutions contacted, a response rate of 57%. We consider this a good response rate given the relatively large amount of effort required to collect and report the information. We promised that the identity of the respondents would be kept confidential, hence in the tabulated data the institutions were identified only by a serial number. Also, prior to writing this paper all institutions agreed to publication of the statistical analyses. The average rating on the 'significance' question was 3.25 and the median was 3.75, indicating that the respondents considered this issue to be an important one, but not yet extremely serious. The results are summarized in Tables 1 and 2 and Figures 1 and 2. We computed five-year trends by a least-squares fit to the data graphed in Fig. 1. For all schools combined, applications declined over five years at an average rate of 8.7 % per year, admissions decreased by 1.3 % per year, and 3.2 % per year fewer students entered the programs. We stratified the data by school size by sorting the schools in order of the average number of students who entered in the 5 years. We divided the respondents into quartiles so that each group contained roughly one quarter of the total number of entering students 3 . The 3 largest schools admitted a fourth of the total number, the next group of 6 schools another quarter, 8 schools fell in the third quartile and 19 schools admitted the last fourth. The four groups are referred to in the following as 'largest', 'large', 'medium' and 'small'. For the 5-year period, the annual average of the total number of students applying to graduate schools at the 36 institutions reporting was 2765, and the average number entering graduate school was 388. The average numbers of entering students per institution for the four groups were 30.7, 18.0, 11.4 and 5.0. Because only 57% of the universities contacted responded, the total numbers of students applying to, accepted by and entering the departments of atmospheric and related sciences at UCAR universities are larger than these numbers. An estimate of the total may be obtained by multiplying these numbers by 1.75 under the assumption that the sample that responded is representative of the total sample. The 8.7% decrease per year in the number of applications represents a decline of about 240 applications per year. The 3.2 % per year decrease in the number of entering students is equivalent to an annual decrease of about 12 students. Variations by school size are evident in the rate of decrease of applications, but all groups experienced negative trends. In the two other categories (admitted and entering) there are positive trends for the largest and small schools and negative trends for the large and medium schools. The overall trends are negative in both cases 4 . The impacts of the changes in the numbers of applications is seen even more clearly if one looks at the ratios of the admissions to applications. This is shown in Fig. 2. along with other ratios of the three categories. Because the number of applications is decreasing faster than the number of admissions, the universities are having fewer choices and are therefore possibly becoming less selective in the students they admit. The GRE scores of students admitted to the graduate programs of the reporting institutions reveal no clear trends with time. The data are noisy. There are, however, significant and interesting differences in the average scores by school size, as shown in Table 2. Scores are highest for the 'largest' schools and lowest for the 'large' schools. One or few schools in the group do not skew the averages for these groups, but the differences apply, with small variations, to all members of the groups. Comparing the three scores in Table 2 with the results reported for all those taking the test and indicating earth, atmospheric and marine sciences as their intended field, the admitted student represent, roughly, the upper 32, 17 and 4 Generally, the data seem to be fairly stable, i.e. without excessive 'noise', except for the numbers of students entering in 1996-97. That year there was a sudden drop in the number of students entering in the largest schools (in all three of schools individually), and this was only partially offset by the number entering in the medium schools 6 33 % (ETS 2000; Table 4). Interestingly, the average scores of student heading into the earth, atmospheric and marine sciences are nearly identical to those going into biological sciences, but much below those interested in physics or chemistry or computer sciences, especially on the quantitative test (ETS 2000; Table 4.)."}, {"section_title": "Other indicators", "text": "The generally unsatisfactory state of science education in this country has been often noted and much debated. Two indicators will suffice to make this point with respect to the number of students receiving graduate degrees in science. First, a fairly broad measure is provided by the fraction of young adults who obtain degrees in the natural sciences or engineering. As an international comparison the following figures are noted: the proportion of the 24-year-old population with degrees in the natural sciences or engineering was near 5.5 % in the U.S. compared with 9.5 % in the U.K., 8.9 % in South Korea and 8.2 % in Germany. Japan and Taiwan are also ahead of the U.S. in this measure. Of the same group of six countries, the U.S. held second place on this score in 1975, slipping to last by 1997 (NSB, 2000a, Fig. 4-15.). Time trends for 1966 to 1997 in science and engineering graduation rates, in relation to the number of people in the appropriate age groups, are upward at the bachelor's and master's levels. At the doctoral level the proportion in 1997 was back to the 0.7% level of the early 1970's after dipping to 0.5 % through the 1980's (NSF 2000b, Tables 56, 57 and 58.) Another indicator of relevance is the number of bachelor's degrees awarded in various disciplines. The number of graduates in physical sciences in 1995 was about 20% lower than in 1981 even though the overall number of bachelor's degrees grew by nearly 20% over the same period (NCES 1998, Indicator 29). Of the many disciplines listed in the survey, ranging from the humanities to engineering, the only field where a decrease has taken place was the physical sciences. A small bit of positive news can be added to this: after ten years of steady decline, the number of physics bachelor's degrees remained unchanged in 1998 from the previous year (AIP 2000). We next consider trends over the past two decades in the number of graduate degrees awarded in the atmospheric and related sciences (NSB 2000b, Tables 4-23 and 4-25;NSF 2000b, Tables 12, 19, 41 and 43). As Fig. 3 shows, the trends are quite different in atmospheric sciences than in oceanography. The long-term upward trend in atmospheric science doctoral degrees appears to have been accompanied by an equally strong downward trend in M.S. degrees earned. On the shorter term, the last two years (1997 and 1998) are down for the Ph.D. degrees. No data are available for M.S. degrees for these years, but the last two years of data (1995 and 1996) also show a downward turn. Trends are more complex for graduates in oceanography, but there seem to be decreases there too in the last two or three years. The differences in patterns are perhaps more clearly evident from Fig. 4, where changes relative to 1999 are shown for doctoral degrees. The rate of increase in Ph.D.s in atmospheric science was considerably greater than in the combined earth-atmosphere-ocean sciences group or for the even larger group of physical-earth-mathematicalbiological sciences. Over the 10-year period shown, the average rate of increase for atmospheric sciences was 3.8% per year. The last two years show a decrease in comparison with all years since 1994. The decreasing rate of growth in the latter part of this period is also evident for the other groupings. A frequently asked question is how the proportions of advanced degree earners vary by race, gender and other social classifications. We have not asked these questions in the survey, for the sake of simplicity. NSF statistical reports contain such information, but only for broad disciplinary divisions. Based on those data, Fig. 5 shows the trends in the numbers of doctorates earned by U.S. citizens and permanent residents versus non-U.S. citizens with temporary visas for earth-atmospheric-ocean sciences (NSF 2000b, Table 3). There is a moderate downward trend for the former group and a sharper increase for the latter group since 1994, but, overall, the 10-years trends are close to insignificant."}, {"section_title": "Present demographics of Ph.D.s in atmospheric sciences", "text": "It is a common perception that the faculty in departments of atmospheric and related sciences is aging, following the trend in all scientific and engineering fields. As Fig. 6a shows, the percentage of full-time doctoral faculty in science and engineering under age 45 has declined from 62% in 1973 to 38% in 1997. The percentage of faculty under 35 has decreased even more, from 26% in 1973 to 8.3% in 1997. Fig. 6b shows the age distribution in a different way; a clear shift in the frequency distribution from younger to older scientists over this 24-year period is evident. Using the same data, the average age of science and engineering faculty increased from 42.5 years in 1973 to 48 years by 1997 (Fig. 7). The rate of increase in average age was nearly constant at about 0.3 number of Ph.D.s in the earth/atmosphere/ocean sciences increased from 15,580 to 18,360 (17.8%) from 1995 to 1999. The decrease in the < 35 year old category, and the accompanying increase in the 35-39 year old category, is evident in both relative and absolute numbers. This may be a reflection of students embarking on Ph.D. programs at a somewhat older age. In the 45-54 year age groups the relative proportions decreased, but the actual numbers increased during the period. The 55 and older age groups show increases both in numbers and in percentages over the period. Overall, there is an aging of Ph.D. scientists in this country, and the trend is likely to continue over the near future unless there is a increase in the numbers of young Ph.D.s entering the field. The spike that appears in Fig. 8 for the 55-59 year age group portends a significant increase in average age over the next ten years or so. Assuming that much of the creativity in the field is contributed by scientists in their younger years, these trends suggest that the vitality of the scientific work force may be a serious issue. They also suggest that a rapid residents. increase in retirements will occur in the next decade, resulting in a shortfall of Ph.D.s unless the number of Ph.D.s entering the field increases."}, {"section_title": "Meeting future needs", "text": "As shown in the previous section, an increasing percentage of the Ph.D. workforce in the atmospheric sciences is approaching retirement age (assumed here to be age 65). If the 5-year decline in the number of graduate applications to departments of atmospheric science is the start of a widespread and persistent trend, the implications for the field could be significant and disturbing. In an extreme case, the viability of some departments may be threatened. More generally, the opportunities and challenges offered by the environment, where the atmospheric sciences play a critical role, demand a steady supply of young, energetic, and creative talent. If these trends continue indefinitely, there will obviously not be enough doctorates in the field to meet future needs. In this section we make some estimates of what these future needs might be and the number of graduates per year required to meet these needs. Obviously any predictions of this type are uncertain, but the scenarios are instructive. We have developed a simple model that estimates the need for future Ph.D. graduates for the field given a number of quantitative assumptions that can be varied to produce different scenarios. Let N t be the total number of  The total number of Ph.D.s needed in M years, N t , is given by where P n is the assumed percent increase (or decrease) in the need.  where P is the percentage of N p in the three age ranges and P R is the probability of retirement of the people in these ranges. We Another way to look at the situation is to interpret the relatively small variabilities of the curves in Fig. 9 as indications for a slowly varying age distribution. If the age distribution were steady state, then, the slope of the lines in Fig. 9  Noting from Fig. 3 that the average number of Ph.D. graduates per year in recent years (1995)(1996)(1997)(1998)(1999) has varied between 100 and 150, we conclude that if this rate is maintained for the next decade, there will be a sufficient number of Ph.D.s by the year 2011 for the base and least need cases. (Note that this does not say anything about the quality or appropriate mix of skills of these Ph.D.s.). However, should either the number of Ph.D graduates continue the recent decline, or the \"greatest need\" scenario occur, there could be a significant shortfall in the number of Ph.D.s required by the field."}, {"section_title": "Implications and conclusions", "text": "One conclusion from the survey is that monitoring of graduate school application and entry numbers can reveal trends well ahead of graduation rates and other measures normally used for examining the human resources health of a research discipline. The atmospheric science community could benefit from a sustained effort to monitor such trends, and this paper can be considered a baseline study to be updated in about 5 years. Our survey and other statistics related to the production of Ph.D.s, and the demographics of Ph.D.s in the atmospheric sciences, indicate reason for concern about the possibility that declining numbers of applications to graduate school and Ph.D. graduates will lead to a significant shortfall in Ph.D.s by the year 2011. However, short-term trends and projections into the future are highly risky. Only a few years ago, the UCAR community was worried about overproduction of graduate students (Mass, 1996). The universities and the National Weather Service were hiring very few new graduates, and a significant concern was whether there would be enough suitable jobs for the large and increasing number of graduates in the atmospheric and related sciences. There were even suggestions that departments of atmospheric science should begin limiting the number of graduates. The community eventually decided that it was not up to the universities to artificially limit graduates and that growing opportunities in the private sector could make up for the reduced hiring in the universities and the government. This decision may turn out to have been wise, but not necessarily for the reasons given at the time. It is important to understand the reason for the drop in graduate school applications and, if it continues, to address the underlying causes. It seems inevitable that the reduced size of applicant pool lead to the entry of less qualified students (even if that is not yet reflected in the GRE scores). The intellectual excitement of the atmospheric sciences, the importance of the field to society, and the availability of powerful observational and theoretical tools to advance the science have never been higher. Perhaps our community is not communicating these aspects of our field to students across a range of disciplines, backgrounds, and cultures. As discussed at the UCAR Fora in 1999 and 2000, more practical issues, such as the long time and great effort needed to obtain a doctorate and the relatively meager financial rewards at the end of the process, may be among the most important reasons for the declining interest. For example, the salaries of new doctorates in the earth and space sciences run considerably below those in other disciplines (CPST 1998;NSF 1997, Table F-1.). Whatever the reasons for the decline in the number of graduate applications and the number of doctoral graduates, we as a community should 15 seek ways to increase the number of qualified applicants. An important aspect of any strategy is to increase the diversity in our field. Caucasian males, who have for so long dominated the field, compose only 33% of the primary and secondary student population in the United States. In addition to all the other good reasons for increasing diversity, the demographics say that we must extend our human resource recruiting pool to all people of the nation. UCAR will respond to these challenges by continuing to monitor the situation through annual surveys of UCAR members and through increased efforts to recruit students from diverse backgrounds into the field.
