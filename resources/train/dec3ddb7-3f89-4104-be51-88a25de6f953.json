In the next century, the rate of global sea level rise is anticipated to be several times higher than measured over the past century Rahmstorf, 2007). The US Northeast coast experiences a rate of relative sea level rise greater than the global average due to substantial regional variations in glacial isostatic adjustment effects and oceanographic processes . Along the US Atlantic coast, the highest rates of subsidence occur from southern Massachusetts to Virginia  and predicted changes in ocean circulation driven by climate change could potentially add meters of dynamic sea level rise near the Northeast coast . The frequency and extent of severe coastal storms is expected to increase (Bender et al., 2010), and large surge levels may cause significant damage to coastal infrastructure and alteration of ecosystems (Irish et al., 2010;Kirshen et al., 2008;McInnes et al., 2003). A discussion of factors driving sea level rise in the region is provided in Appendix 1. This investigation will assess inundation risk from sea level rise and storm surge at sentinel sites in three coastal, northeastern United States National Parks-Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area, Cape Cod National Seashore, and Assateague Island National Seashore. Sentinel sites are locations of natural or cultural resources of special importance to the National Park Service. The term \"at risk\" is used to indicate that a sentinel site is predicted to be inundated as a result of sea level rise or storm surge. Some sites that are predicted to be at \"at risk\" are not necessarily threatened or impacted; natural features may be altered as a result of rising water levels yet persist because of their resilience to change. However, habitats, cultural, or infrastructural resources may be severely impacted if they are inundated. Thus, \"risk\" does not imply \"impact\" in my study. In either case, an understanding of the relative vulnerability of each sentinel site to inundation will allow park resource managers to develop management and mitigation strategies for these sites. A variety of quantitative approaches have been used to assess the impact of sea level rise and storm surge on coastal inundation and flooding. Several hydrodynamic models are used to model inundation from rising sea levels, for example: MIKE 21 and MIKE FLOOD (Sto. Domingo et al., 2010), LISFLOOD-FP (Lewis et al., 2011) and ANUGA (Van Drie, Milevski, and Simon, 2010). The US Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) relies on a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) model, HAZUS-MH, to estimate the physical, economic and social impacts of largescale flooding events . Other GISbased methods have been applied as well (Brown, 2006;Hennecke and Cowell, 2000). A review of sea level and storm surge inundation models is provided in Appendix 2. Coarse-scale assessments for sea level rise and storm surge risk have been previously conducted. The Coastal Vulnerability Index (CVI) technique was applied at Cape Cod National Seashore (Hammar-Klose et al., 2003) and at Assateague Island National Seashore (Pendleton, Williams, and Thieler, 2004). The method combines a number of physical variables in order to classify the relative risk of 1.5 km shoreline segments to sea level rise impacts. Gutierrez, Williams, and Thieler (2007) studied potential shoreline changes from sea level rise along the U.S. Mid-Atlantic Coast. The CVI and shoreline change assessments were designed to provide a regional overview of coastal vulnerability and do not have the spatial resolution for site-specific risk assessment. All vulnerability models and methods rely on elevation data, which are often highly limited in their vertical accuracy and cause large ranges of uncertainty in results . The National Elevation Dataset (NED) is the largest scale, readily available topographic dataset for the country but with a vertical accuracy (RMSE, or root mean square error) of 2.44 m (Gesch, 2007) is of little value in assessing inundation risk at specific sites. My study relies on two sources of higher accuracy elevation data for sentinel sites: light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data and real time kinematic global positioning system (RTK GPS) data. My assessment integrates output for three sea level rise scenarios and four storm surge scenarios from several modeling approaches: bath-tub inundation modeling with tidal-orthometic datum conversion, application of the Sea Level Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM), and application of the Sea, Land and Overland Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH) model. The probabilities of inundation at sentinel sites are calculated for each modeled scenario and an index is developed to estimate overall inundation likelihood at a sentinel site. This overall index of inundation likelihood will be a valuable tool for prioritizing long-term management and climate change adaptation plans at sentinel sites in the National Parks."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study Areas", "text": "I conducted analyses at three coastal parks ( Figure 1 and contains a variety of marine, estuarine, and terrestrial ecosystems.

The three study areas represent a diversity of coastal ecosystem landscapes: a barrier island of the mid-Atlantic (ASIS), an extensive peninsula (CACO), and a rocky coast within the Gulf of Maine (BOHA).

LiDAR data are typically accurate to 0.15-1 m .

RTK GPS provides data to within 5 cm vertical accuracy."}, {"section_title": "Sea Level Rise Scenarios", "text": "Three scenarios were selected to represent the current range of sea level rise predictions for the year 2100: 0.6 m (IPCC, 2007), 1 m , and 2 m . They were modeled using two methods. The first approach-the bath-tub model-involved creating a planar water surface that represents the sea level rise scenario added to the Mean Higher High Water (MHHW) tidal elevation. Modeling sea level rise or storm surge in addition to the MHHW level represents the worst case inundation scenario. These water surface elevations were calculated using VDatum software (NOAA, 2011), which performs elevation conversions between NAVD88 (an orthometric datum) and tidal datums. The land surface elevation and modeled water surface were compared and probabilities of inundation at sentinel sites were calculated using the z-score inundation uncertainty technique described by NOAA Coastal Services Center (2010a). Standard scores, or z-scores, were calculated at each sentinel site using the formula: Where the total RMSE (root mean square error) is calculated as: RMSE for LiDAR DEMs is calculated as: Where X LiDAR is the elevation from LiDAR at a single location and X GPS is the elevation as determined by GPS in the same location. RMSEs for the GPS survey elevations were reported by Trimble Software. RMSEs for water surfaces were reported by VDatum. The standard normal cumulative distribution function was used to calculate probabilities of inundation and the certainty of the prediction given errors associated with the data and models (Ott and Longnecker, 2010). Two probabilities of inundation were calculated for each sentinel site: one using the elevation from the LiDAR-derived DEM, and the second using the elevation determined from the RTK GPS survey. The two methods used to measure elevation at sentinel sites -LiDAR-derived DEM and RTK GPS of the site -had very different vertical accuracies (RMSE values) and resulted in different estimates of the probability of inundation. The second approach used to evaluate sea level rise inundation was the Sea Level Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM). The model requires a digital elevation model (DEM) layer, a slope layer (derived from the DEM), a detailed land-use layer, parameters for tidal ranges (NOAA, 2007), and if known, accretion rates for nearby marshes. The land-use layer was created by merging Coastal Change Analysis Program data (NOAA, 2006) and National Wetlands Inventory data (USFWS, 2010) and recoding them to SLAMM categories as specified by the User Manual (Warren Pinnacle Consulting, 2010). Some accretion parameters were obtained from Surface Elevation Table (SET) data (Lynch, 2012;NPS, 2009). When parameters were unknown or unavailable, SLAMM's default settings were used. Using linear relationships and decision tree rules, SLAMM calculates water elevation at a particular location, and computes inundation and habitat response over large areas . The output maps showed expected habitat classes and areas of inundation based on the different rates and magnitudes of sea level rise. Sentinel site locations were mapped over the output. Change matrices were created to show changes from initial habitat to the predicted habitat for each sentinel site."}, {"section_title": "Storm Surge Scenarios", "text": "The SLOSH (Sea, Land and Overland Surges from Hurricanes) model, a forecast model for hurricane-induced water levels for the Gulf and Atlantic Coasts ) was used to model expected surge heights along park coasts from Saffir-Simpson Category 1-4 hurricanes. Surge heights are not uniform along the coastline and depend on the hurricane track, wind speed, and topography and bathymetry at the point where the storm makes landfall (FEMA, 2003). Storm surge heights were derived from the Providence/Boston and Ocean City storm basins in SLOSH and used as input in the Applied Science Associates, Inc. (ASA) Inundation Toolbox -Interpolation tool . The tool interpolated the point heights to a raster surface of the same extent and resolution as the DEM. Elevations from the DEM were compared to the elevations from the storm surge surfaces and probabilities of inundation at sentinel sites were calculated using the z-score uncertainty technique described above. The uncertainty technique incorporated known sources of error unique to the water surface modeled by SLOSH. For each of the four storm scenarios, two probabilities were calculated: one given the elevation of a sentinel site from the DEM and another given the elevation of a sentinel site from the RTK GPS survey. ArcGIS 10 software was used for all geospatial data processing (ESRI, 2011).

To validate the accuracy estimates, I calculated the vertical RMSE using ground control points of high quality and accuracy (< 2 cm vertical and horizontal accuracy) collected using survey-grade GPS (Table 3) For CACO, the control points were obtained from the park's surveys in [2004][2005][2006][2007][2008][2009] and from the URI-NPS monumentation project surveys of recently installed and stable existing geodetic monumentation in 2011 . Using 35 control points, the vertical RMSE of the LiDAR DEM was 0.53 m. For ASIS, the control points were obtained from topographic profiles collected in 2010, and from surveys of geodetic monumentation in 2011 . For ASIS, the vertical RMSE was 0.33 m. Based on the recommendations of NOAA (2010), vertical accuracies were sufficiently high for ASIS that inundation models could be run for all three sea level rise scenarios (0.6 m, 1 m, 2 m). LiDAR data for CACO were accurate enough so that inundation probabilities could be reasonably estimated for the 1 m and 2 m scenarios."}, {"section_title": "Inundation Models", "text": "Sea level rise scenarios were mapped and are shown for selected parts of CACO ( Figure 2) and ASIS ( Figure 3). Maps with park-scale views of each scenario modeled are found in Appendix 5 (Figures A5.1-A5.5). Expected surge heights from Category 1-4 storms were modeled at CACO and ASIS (Table 4). The bath-tub and storm surge models were used to map areas at risk from inundation. An area was considered at risk from inundation if it had an elevation less than or equal to the water surface elevation that was expected in any given location (Table 5) \nBath-tub modeling is a technique that tends to overestimate inundation extents and calculate uncertain predictions . The use of high accuracy RTK GPS equipment helped minimize the error in estimating inundation risk. Because the error associated with each sentinel site elevation was low, there was less uncertainty associated with each modeled scenario, i.e. many of the sentinel sites had probabilities of inundation of either 0 (very unlikely) or 1 (very likely). This was not the case with probabilities of inundation calculated using elevations at sentinel sites based on LiDAR data, where many probabilities of inundation were included in the range of 0.25 to 0.75. Therefore, the LiDAR-derived DEMs were used only for mapping areas at risk and providing a map assessment of the extent of inundation (Figures 2-5 and A5.1-A5.13). Inundation probabilities at sentinel sites using LiDAR-derived elevations were not used for developing the overall inundation index. One of the most valuable products of this assessment is the range of storm surge heights modeled by SLOSH (Table 4). These surge heights can be used for predictions of hurricane impacts in the near future. For example, the SLOSH model predicted extensive inundation in Provincetown and the salt marsh sites in Cape Cod.

Probabilities were determined using the RTK GPS and LiDAR elevations. Mean probabilities from RTK GPS elevations are reported (Table 6 and Table 7) due to their higher accuracy. The complete list of sentinel sites and probabilities of inundation can be found in Appendix 4 (Table A4.1). The mean probabilities of inundation at CACO were significantly different under the two sea level rise scenarios (Wilcoxon signed rank V=0, p < 0.001). At ASIS, the mean probabilities of inundation were significantly different under the three sea level rise scenarios (H=66.02, df=2, p < 0.0001). The mean probabilities of inundation for four storm surge scenarios were significantly different in both CACO (H=44.51, df=3, p < 0.0001) and ASIS (H=96.52, df=3, p < 0.0001)."}, {"section_title": "Habitat Changes Predicted by SLAMM", "text": "The SLAMM model predicted habitat classes under selected sea level rise scenarios by the year 2100. Change matrices show the number of sentinel sites in each habitat class initially, and their expected conversions as a result of sea level rise. In CACO, only 2 scenarios were modeled because of the vertical accuracy of the LiDAR data (the primary input driving the model) was inadequate to support the 0.6 m scenario. Many of the sentinel sites were originally in the \"Developed Dry Land\" category (12 out of 63) and remained unchanged because one of the assumptions of the model is that developed dry land would be protected by human actions over time. This may not be an appropriate assumption for some National Park study sites. A few sentinel sites in the \"Undeveloped Dry Land\" category experienced conversions to \"Transitional Marsh,\" \"Estuarine Beach,\" and in one case, to \"Open Ocean\" after 2 m of sea level rise (Table 8). In ASIS, many sentinel sites were in the \"Undeveloped Dry Land\" class (24 out of 34) and experienced conversions to \"Transitional Marsh,\" \"Estuarine Beach,\" \"Ocean Beach,\" and \"Open Ocean\". Points that started out in the \"Irregularly Flooded Marsh\" converted to \"Salt Marsh\" after 2 m of sea level rise (Table 9). According to the recommendation of Scarborough (2009), similar classes were aggregated for ease of interpretability (Table 10 and Table 11). Similarly, mapping the SLAMM output with the aggregated classes aided in interpretability.  (Table 12). Nearly all variables had similar loading values on PC1, thus PC1 represents a \"size\" effect (August, 1983) and is an excellent index of overall inundation likelihood. The other principal components had high loadings on only one or two variables and reflected specific risk factors. Furthermore, they did not predict a large amount of overall variation, thus are not candidates for an overall risk index. The range of PC1 values for each park was separated into five quintiles. Large positive PC1 scores for sentinel sites indicate that inundation is very unlikely; large negative PC1 scores indicate that inundation is very likely (Table 13). Sentinel sites' raw PC1 scores are given in Table A4.1. Overall inundation index classification at sentinel sites is mapped for CACO ( Figure 8) and ASIS ( Figure 9)."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Quality of Elevation Data", "text": "The poor accuracy of the BOHA LiDAR data and the reduced spatial extent of the CACO LiDAR data were limiting factors in my analyses of sea level rise and storm surge vulnerability. Differences in data accuracies are likely due to differences in the data collection technologies. The Boston LiDAR data were collected in 2002 using the Digital Airborne Topographic Imaging System II (DATIS II), while the CACO and ASIS LiDAR data were collected in 2005 and 2009, respectively, using the Experimental Advanced Airborne Research LiDAR (EAARL) system . Furthermore, different geoid models were used to compute the elevations for the DEMs. A geoid is a representation of the equal gravitational potential surface of the earth, or the sea level surface of the earth, and a geoid model is used to convert heights from the NAD83 ellipsoid reference system to the NAVD88 vertical datum (NGS, 2011). The BOHA and CACO DEMs were computed with the Geoid99 model, while the ASIS DEM was computed using the Geoid09 model. All RTK GPS points were computed using the Geoid09 model. For the Boston region, I found a 2 cm difference in elevations between the two geoid models using the NGS Geodetic Toolkit (NGS, 2011). This explains a small part of the results I obtained in the accuracy assessment of the LiDAR data. However, the poor vertical accuracy of the BOHA LiDAR data (1.65 m) was significantly greater than the error from mixing geoid models (2 cm). All three of the LiDAR datasets had reported vertical RMSE of 0.15 m. If I had used the BOHA LiDAR data for the inundation modeling using the reported vertical error, the results would have been seriously misleading. Therefore, it is prudent to independently evaluate the vertical accuracy of the elevation data used to be certain they meet the requirements of the analysis. The excellent quality of the RTK GPS elevation data was an important asset for this project. GPS field surveys allowed us to collect accurate elevations of sentinel sites that most likely could not be reached by LiDAR signals and sensors (NOAA CSC, 2010b). For example, we surveyed elevations of groundwater monitoring wells located in forests with heavy canopy cover. Because these elevations were measured with great accuracy using the RTK GPS (0.006-0.087 m), inundation probabilities were calculated with greater certainty. The application of RTK GPS is a promising solution to elevation uncertainty issues in sea level rise inundation risk assessments. It is important to note, however, that RTK GPS protocols require operating a GPS base station at a location that has been surveyed to within a few millimeters. Thus, a network of accurate geodetic control sites within 5 km of potential sentinel sites is an essential requirement for RTK GPS measurement ."}, {"section_title": "SLAMM", "text": "The SLAMM model was limited by the quality of the data driving the model (LiDAR-derived DEMs). Using the RTK GPS elevations to enhance the results of the model was not possible. An important baseline dataset for the SLAMM model was initial land use classification. In this study, initial land use conditions were obtained from National Wetlands Inventory maps created using aerial photography from 1988 (ASIS) and 1993 (CACO), and as a result these maps did not reflect changes that might have occurred over the past two decades. Furthermore, there is no way to quantitatively determine the uncertainty associated with a SLAMM prediction. These factors and others limit the output results Scarborough, 2009).  (Table 6). At CACO, three (1 m scenario) and 11 sites (2 m scenario) have probabilities of inundation greater than 75%, and at ASIS, 11 (1 m scenario) and 32 (2 m scenario) sites have probabilities of inundation greater than 75%. This difference confirms the notion that bath-tub models over estimate inundation NOAA, 2010), but it may also suggest that SLAMM under estimates inundation. In presenting the SLAMM output in maps, it was important to stress the uncertainty of habitat predictions due to errors in input elevation and land cover maps.  Figure   A6.1). In their study, segments of shoreline were ranked low to high vulnerability using an index that combined geological and physical variables. The locations of high vulnerability sentinel sites as ranked by the Inundation Index tend to appear immediately inland of those shoreline segments with a high CVI vulnerability rank. At Assateague Island, all of the sentinel sites were in low elevations below 2.6 m. Many of them are at risk from sea level rise and storm surge from large hurricanes. The CVI assessment (Pendleton, Williams, and Thieler, 2004) at ASIS ( Figure A6.2) and spatial pattern of the overall Inundation Index corroborate each other also. Disagreement occurs at points near the Chincoteague Inlet.

The report projects 0.26 to 0.59 m of global sea level rise by 2100 under the \"business as usual\" greenhouse gas emissions scenario (IPCC, 2007). This represents a conservative estimate because it does not consider either increased greenhouse gas emissions over the next century, or changes in ocean volume caused by increased flow of Greenland and Antarctic ice . Determining the rate and acceleration of local sea level rise is complicated by the small number of long-term tide gauges (Houston and Dean, 2011), strong spatial variation in the distribution of melting ocean waters , and seasonal-to-decadal temporal variation (Church, White, and Arblaster, 2005). However, many climate scientists agree that the Northeast coast is particularly vulnerable to higher rates of relative sea level rise (Frumhoff et al., 2007). Along with high rates of subsidence, the northeast North American coast faces a predicted increase in dynamic sea level due to Atlantic meridional overturning circulation slowdown in the 21 st century . Global climate models predict ocean surface warming would shut down deep convection in the Labrador Sea and slow the sub-polar gyre, and these impacts would result in dynamic, or ocean circulation driven, sea level rise in the Northeast region .

The most basic models are 0D and do not include any physical laws. 0D models overlay the determined high water level with a digital elevation model to create a water surface. This is a popular method and is also referred to as \"linear superposition\" or \"bath-tub modeling.\" It is relatively inexpensive to run and can coarsely approximate coastal vulnerability for a variety of scenarios. The results can be incorporated into a Geographic Information System (GIS) to calculate potentially inundated areas. The bath-tub approach provides quick analyses of vulnerability at regional and global scales. The analysis is done in a raster environment. The approach identifies all cells with elevations lower than the projected sea level rise as vulnerable to inundation. A more sophisticated approach incorporates connectivity and requires that the cells identified as vulnerable have elevations lower than the projected sea level rise and are adjacent to the ocean or to other inundated cells . The approach is limited: it does not incorporate flood defenses, or recognize coastal processes such as wetland accretion. It tends to result in large overestimations of flood extents. Like all modeling approaches, it is limited by uncertainties in sea level projections and elevation data, and lack of data on the feedback of physical and social systems (e.g. sediment transport regimes and human adaptation responses).

The user inputs the bathymetry and topography for the study area, the initial water level and boundary conditions such as tide or any forcing terms that may drive the system such as wind stress or atmospheric pressure (Nielsen et al., 2005). The study area is represented by a mesh of triangular cells. The model was developed primarily for modeling effects of tsunami and was validated with a wave tank simulation of the 1993 Okushiri Island Tsunami (Nielsen et al., 2005). Developers suggest using the model for detailed inundation modeling of small sections . ANUGA is being developed to incorporate riverine flooding and storm surge flooding scenarios. The model has only been tested at a few locations and the current release (Version 1.2.1) is still in the development and debugging process. I downloaded and installed the software from the website and found that the documentation and forums were unhelpful in understanding implementation. I also found that I did not have enough technical knowledge of Python to debug some of the issues."}, {"section_title": "MIKE by DHI Software Series", "text": "The ArcGIS and was used in Sweden to simulate riverine flooding and obtain flood information for emergency planning (Yang and Rystedt, 2002).The program is available for $57,400 and there is a university discount for student researchers (DHI, 2011). The prohibitive nature of the price also led me to remove it from consideration for the NPS study. However, the model seems to be a suitable tool for engineers and could be appropriate for other research endeavors."}, {"section_title": "ADCIRC", "text": "The ADCIRC (Advanced Circulation) Model was developed as a joint project between the University of Notre Dame and University of North Carolina Chapel Hill (Luettich, Westernick, and Scheffner, 1992;Westerink et al., 1992). The 2D and 3D components of the program solve equations for motion for a moving fluid on a rotating earth using traditional hydrostatic pressure and Boussinesq approximations. The software is used to model tides and wind driven circulation, analyze hurricane storm surge and flooding, and conduct dredging and material disposal studies and larval transport studies. FEMA uses ADCIRC to develop FIRMs (Flood Insurance Rate Maps). ADCIRC has been used to model storm surge for New Orleans, Louisiana (Westerink et al., 2008), the Chesapeake Bay (Shen, Gong, and Wang, 2005;Shen, Gong, and Wang, 2006) and the northeastern Gulf of Mexico (Chen, Wang, and Tawes, 2008). These studies have demonstrated the high accuracy of the ADCIRC model in simulating coastal storm surge . The program is extremely complex, run on over 100 computers simultaneously at the UNC campus and cannot be used by me for the NPS study. While the software is too computer intensive for the NPS study, it could be an appropriate approach for other projects."}, {"section_title": "HAZUS-MH", "text": "The calculates the physical damage and economic loss using census block and default building inventory data . The user can edit this database or incorporate locally available flood information using the Flood Information Tool (FIT) in the software. I decided not to use HAZUS-MH for the NPS study. Damon (2010)  There is great debate surrounding this model and its outputs. One limitation of the model is that it is sensitive to the time-step selected. Regardless of the sea level elevation change chosen, SLAMM will only convert habitats once per time step and only to the next category defined. For example, a cell that begins as dry land, but becomes inundated due to SLR, will convert as follows: Dry Land \u00bb Transitional Marsh \u00bb Salt Marsh \u00bb Tidal Flat \u00bb Open Water (Hancock, 2009). Selecting a smaller time step (ex. 2 years) can address this issue, but is computationally demanding. The modeling approach also does not account for infrequent events that influence wetland vertical development such as storms and floods. Furthermore, there is no way to quantitatively determine the uncertainty associated with a SLAMM prediction. Another concern is that SLAMM does not consider increased rates of accretion due to sea level rise, a feedback mechanism that can be incorporated into numerical models. Many wetland scientists recommend use of the elevation capital technique  and the use of numerical coastal models that predict the response of sea level through non-linear feedback mechanisms  for local studies."}, {"section_title": "SLOSH", "text": "The SLOSH (Sea, Land and Overland Surges from Hurricanes) model was developed by the National Weather Service (NWS) to predict storm surge heights resulting from historical, hypothetical or predicted hurricanes (FEMA, 2003).  . The output can be used to estimate potential surge and flooding for a given hurricane category, forward speed and direction (FEMA, 2003). Storm surge heights can be viewed in two ways. For each storm category, forward speed and direction of motion, the model creates a MEOW, Maximum Envelope of Water, which is the set of the highest surge values at each grid location. MOMs represent a worst case scenario of surge inundation, and therefore should not be used for emergency planning (Marcy, 2011). The reported accuracy for the SLOSH model is plus or minus 20% of the peak storm surge. If the model calculates a peak storm surge of 10 feet for the event, the observed peak ranges from 8 to 12 feet. The accuracy was accessed by looking at surge measurements (primarily high water marks) from past hurricanes. The model does not account for rainfall amounts, river flow or wind-driven waves (FEMA, 2003). SLOSH has been utilized in many inundation vulnerability assessments Stockdon and Thompson, 2007)."}, {"section_title": "Coastal Vulnerability Indices", "text": "The Coastal Vulnerability Index (CVI) was developed by the USGS Coastal and Marine Geology Program to determine the relative risk that physical changes will occur as sea level rises (Thieler, Williams, and Hammar-Klose, 1999). The index is a simple classification of the relative vulnerability of shoreline segments. The index is based on six criteria: tidal range, wave height, coastal slope, geomorphology, shoreline erosion rate and historical relative sea level rise rate, gathered from a variety of sources. The approach yields a relative ranking of possibility that future physical change will occur."}, {"section_title": "Decisions", "text": "For my inundation risk assessment of National Park study sites, I chose to utilize the bath-tub modeling approach and address some of its limitations, following recommendations from NOAA (2010). For example, I incorporated an orthometrictidal datum conversion to ensure that projected sea level rise was added to a tidal surface and not to heights from the orthometric datum. I also performed a calculation of uncertainty in inundation predictions that incorporated known errors from the elevation dataset, tide gauges and vertical conversion software. When reporting predicted areas of inundation, I only reported areas that were connected to the ocean surface or other flooded areas. Areas that may be protected by land barriers or other features were not included. I decided to use SLAMM because it is a large scale landscape model that simulates general trends over large areas. I understand its limitations and that the output is not suitable for site-specific research problems. Scaling down results to the local level is not feasible with any degree of certainty, because so many variables are unknown. However, I believe it can provide us with some level of understanding to discuss overall vulnerability and shape management goals. The model has great potential to be modified and improved as more knowledge about wetland processes is acquired. For storm surge modeling and risk assessment, I chose to use output from the SLOSH model. I used the MOM (Maximum of MEOW) heights from the Providence/Boston and Ocean City basins for Saffir-Simpson Category 1-4 Hurricanes (Figure A2.1). The horizontal resolution of the output data varied in each study area; it ranged from 1.3 to 1.9 km in the Cape Cod area, from 0.4 to 0.7 km in the Boston area, and from 1.0 to 2.3 km in the Assateague Island area. The model is widely used in the risk mapping community and has benefited from National Weather Service's consistent updates of parameters following large storm events. The output was processed with the help of Kelly Knee, a water resources engineer, at Applied Science Associates, Inc. I used their \"Inundation Toolbox\"  to model and map flooding results.
