The degree could be high, low or moderate. The need could be self-actualisation, or esteem, social or safety need hygiene factor which influences their retention. Job satisfaction is the level to which teachers' wants, resources and mental, inherent and extrinsic are achieved while performing their job. Sempane (2002) opined that job uniqueness add significantly to teachers' job satisfaction and retention. Job satisfaction is linked to enhanced teachers' job performance and good pointer of retention. What comprises teachers' job satisfaction are used to offer sustenance for new and experienced teachers to improve their performance and retention in teaching (Wood & Weasmer,(2004) .\nOver the years, one challenge that continued to stare the Post Primary Education Board in Akwa and Owerri in the South -East Geo of Nigeria in the face is over staffing in the urban secondary schools and acute manpower shortage in the corresponding rural and riverine schools. Though some of the issues accountable for this intolerable dichotomy are both real and serious, the need for a balance through mindful efforts to optimally staff the rural and riverine schools need not be exaggerated. Empowerment of teachers in urban and rural location enhances their job performance and boosts their initiative and retention in the schools (Cote & Morgan, 2002) ."}, {"section_title": "Statement of the Problem", "text": "Most developing states in Nigeria are concerned with how to foster development more rapidly so as to bridge the gap between them and the developed states. Thus education has become an instrument per excellence in the rapid fostering of objectives. However, the operation of the educational enterprise in Anambra and Imo States seems to leave much room for concern. The caliber of the teaching force to a large extent determines the accomplishment or malfunction of teaching in the schools. The educational system is not attracting and retaining the right type of people to carry out teaching in ways that will lead to the achievement of educational objectives. The recruitment and retention of competent teachers into secondary schools is a perennial problem the entire world, but the case of Anambra and Imo States, Nigeria is particularly serious and disturbing.\nThe basic task of schools is teaching and public secondary schools in Anambra and Imo States are experiencing a high rate of attrition of teachers due to poor funding, poor working conditions, inadequate facilities, lack of incentives for teachers , nonpayment of teachers' salaries etc. The total educational environment frustrates dedicated teachers who are forced to operate in a chronic state of discontent. Turnover is a very serious problem in the schools as performance is eliminated and corrective actions will no more be taken. Standards of acceptable performance and behaviour are not set governments of Anambra and Imo States, Nigeria. Job satisfaction is described in terms of teacher's general stance and response in relation to their positive approval of situation surrounding their job. For teachers to be satisfied with their job, they have to be satisfied with the various aspects of job situation, such as the pay, promotion, among others that encourages teachers' retention. The degree of teachers job satisfaction could be determined by the level of job fulfillment they needed. The degree could be high, low or moderate. The need could be self-actualisation, or esteem, social or safety need hygiene factor which influences their retention."}, {"section_title": "Research Questions", "text": "The following research questions were raised to guide the study: There is no significant relationship between years of experience as a moderating variable, job satisfaction and teachers' retention in public secondary schools in Anambra and Imo States."}, {"section_title": "3.", "text": "There is no significant relationship between gender as a moderating variable, job satisfaction and teachers' retention in public secondary schools in Anambra and Imo States."}, {"section_title": "4.", "text": "There is no relationship between location and teachers' retention in public secondary schools in Anambra and Imo States."}, {"section_title": "Purpose of the study", "text": "The main purpose of the study was to investigate relationship between job satisfaction and teachers' retention in public secondary schools in Anambra and Imo States.

Alastaire (2011) in a study on relationship between personality factors, occupational adjustment and productivity, established that there was significant relationship between mental ability, retention, inclination to panic and job satisfaction. It was further established that there was significant relationship between job security, job satisfaction and retention. Commey, Pfiffner and Beem (2013) in a study on factors influencing organisational effectiveness established that staff in the better rated offices had more democratic supervision, less disagreement, job satisfaction and retention. Judge, Thoresan , Bono and Patton (2001) in their study o established that there was a stronger relationship between mentoring , job satisfaction , performance and retention . Harter, Schmidt and Hayes (2012) in their study on business unit level relationship between employee's satisfaction, employee's engagement and outcome, established that when satisfaction is described and measured by teachers' engagement, there was a significant relationship with performance outcomes, satisfaction, and retention. Basich (2018) established that the teachers' leadership does not stand alone in enhancing teachers' job satisfaction and retention. Bogler (2001) in a study on influence of two different types of leadership styles and their influence on teacher job satisfaction. He further examined the decision-making procedure of principals and its influence on teacher job satisfaction and personal beliefs about their profession. He studied two management approaches and their influence on teacher satisfaction. The first was transformational leadership, which is typified by sustenance of teachers, originality and idea in their job performance. Principals who are transformational leaders are supposed to be charismatic, take personal thought in accepting their group, and have the scholarly aptitude to arouse group. The other type of leadership as transactional leadership, are typified by constancy and situational administration of schools matters. Every method of leadership utters a climate and reply from teachers.\nBogler wanted to investigate a particular method of leadership that would guide to higher levels of job satisfaction for teachers and to determine if the technique principals' employed in circumstances where decisions had to be made have influence on the levels of teachers' job satisfaction. Findings of the study showed that there was a high rate of teachers' job satisfaction and retention in teaching profession. Further finding revealed that there are variables that enhance teacher's job satisfaction to a higher extent; and there are variables, to some extent that cannot be controlled that influence teacher's level of job satisfaction. Certo and Fox (2002) in a study on retaining quality teachers. This study was based on teacher attrition and retention in seven Virginia school districts, with focal point at teachers who continue in teaching and those who left the profession within these districts. Findings showed that school background obviously leads to levels of teacher job satisfaction and retention. Edey and Huston (2004) in a study on the high rates of attrition and retention problems in the San Diego schools. Findings showed that there was a negative influence between teachers' years of experience, extent of satisfaction and retention. Further findings showed that new teachers were more likely to leave within the first three years in the profession.\nOkorodudu (2005) in a study on motivational indices as predictors of work attitude of teachers in public secondary schools in Delta state. Findings showed that there was significant inter correlation between motivational indices and its components of economic and non economic indices including interdependent r 33, f (N-2, 682) =. l9, P<.05) and r =.73, df (N-2,682)=.19, P<. O5) respectively Furthermore a significant relationship was established between non economic motivational indices and teachers work attitude and retention indicating significant degree of association r .34, (N-2, 682) =.19, <.05). George (2005) studied determinants of job satisfaction among beginning academic staff established that job satisfaction as academic staff emotional response to their job environment which as influence on their retention.\nParmer and East (2007) in their study, established that job satisfaction significantly relates with retention of teachers. Job satisfaction is an essential factor that influences teacher's' plan and eagerness. Perrachione, Rosser, and Peterson (2008) in a study on the internal and external needs of teachers. Findings showed that three intrinsic issues such as individual teaching effectiveness, functioning with students, and job satisfaction positively influence teachers' satisfaction and retention. Furthermore, two extrinsic motivators such as poor salary and job overload, negatively influence teachers job fulfillment and retention Alfonso and Sousa-Poza (2011) in their study established that teachers' job satisfaction is determined by decision and equilibrium between job inputs and outputs. Findings showed that having a motivating job and -having high-quality relationships with principals\u2016, determines the proportion of variance in teachers' job fulfillment and retention. Petty, Fitchett, and O'Connor (2012) in their study, established that teachers were motivated to prolong teaching in a high want school since they were concerned about their students, had strong managerial maintenance, and a constructive school background. Sims (2017) in a study on working conditions, teacher job satisfaction and retention. Findings showed that more cooperation between teachers and more effective specialised improvement is connected with increased teacher job satisfaction and retention.\nSelzer (2000) in a study on 553 teachers who were in their first year of teaching. Findings showed that they deemed assistance from experienced teachers and job security as the main support they could have to persist through their first year of teaching. They deemed inadequate administrative assistance, inadequate direction to guidelines and working conditions as the most determinant of job satisfaction and retention. Bogler (2001) in a study on influence of two different types of leadership styles and their influence on teacher job satisfaction. He further examined the decision-making procedure of principals and its influence on teacher job satisfaction and personal beliefs about their profession. He studied two management approaches and their influence on teacher satisfaction. Findings showed that the more teachers considered teaching profession, the more they supposed that principals should be transformational leaders. Judge, Thoresan, Bono and Patton (2001) in their study on the job satisfaction and job performance : A qualitative and quantitative review . Findings showed that there was a stronger relationship between mentoring, job satisfaction, performance and teachers' retention."}, {"section_title": "Years of Experience as a Moderating Variable, Job Satisfaction and Teachers' Retention in Public Secondary Schools in Anambra and Imo States", "text": "Bedeian, Ferris and Kacmar (1992) in their study established that years of experience of male and female teachers is a steadier predictor of job satisfaction and retention than their age. Further findings revealed that there was a encouraging relationship between years of experience, teacher's job satisfaction and retention. The National Center for Education Statistics (1997)conducted a study based on the assessment of the working conditions of teachers and additional information based on the work of Choy et al. (1993) who studied the factors associated to teacher dissatisfaction and teacher turnover. Findings of this study showed many issues had a positive influence on teachers' job satisfaction and retention. They are administrative support; students discipline, positive school climate, and teachers' independence have relationship with higher levels of teacher satisfaction and retention. Additional findings showed that salary was indistinctly related with teacher's job satisfaction and retention. National Center for Education Statistics (1997) as well examined the descriptors of teachers' current levels of satisfaction; they separated the sample into one of three groups (low, medium, or high satisfaction). Findings showed that 34% of teachers interviewed agreed that they were not certain if they would remain in teaching if they had the opportunity. Thirty-two % agreed they would surely become a teacher once more if they had to do it all over again, and the remaining 35% surveyed agreed that they were moderately satisfied with teaching profession. Klecker and Loadman (1997) in their study established that the years of experience was a factor that was influencing teachers' satisfaction. Findings showed that teachers' job satisfaction and retention significantly relate with communication with students and working conditions do not significantly relate with job satisfaction and retention.\nFindings as well showed that years of experience, do not relate with teacher's' job satisfaction and retention based on salary and fringe benefits, working conditions and interactions with their students. There was significant relationship between teachers' job satisfaction following the initial five years of teaching. Ma and MacMillan's (1999) in their study established that older and more experienced teachers expressed significantly less satisfaction with their professional role than their younger and less experienced male teachers and that elementary teachers were more satisfied than the secondary teachers. Henke et al (2002) in their study used the National Center for Education Statistics' (1993) Baccalaureate and Beyond Survey (B&B) to study experiences of new teachers, as well as the relationship between fresh teachers' involvement in mentoring programmes and their attrition. Findings showed that there was 21% of new teacher attrition by spring 1997. That is about one-fifth of fresh college graduates who had entered teaching between 1993 and 1997 were no longer teaching by July 1997.Findings as well showed that participation in induction was significantly and negatively related to attrition from teaching profession. 15 % of those who had participated in mentoring had left teaching, in contrast with 26% of persons who had not participated in mentoring programme. Richards (2003) in a study on characteristics of satisfied teachers. Findings showed that teachers valued just, truthful, and reliable behaviour in their principals. The desire for support with parents in issues of discipline improved with years of experience. Further findings showed that new teachers continue to leave teaching profession in the initial year of employment; government must recognise factors that will encourage teachers to remain in the profession and issues connected to attrition if the present teacher deficiency should be corrected.\nBivona (2002) in a study on the influences of teachers' attitudes toward their perceptions of teaching. The sample was 20 teachers. Findings showed that teacher confidence positively relates with teachers' satisfaction and retention. More than half of the teachers intended to remain in teaching. Loeb, Darling-Hammond and Luczak (2005) in a study on the factors affecting teacher satisfaction, but focused their attention on newly employed teachers. Findings showed that there was a significant relationship between school conditions and teacher retention Furthermore, 22% of sampled teachers expressed their serious anxiety about teacher retention in schools. Henry, Bastian, and Fortner (2011) in their study on novice teachers in the public school setting, attempted to uncover particular areas that relate to retention. Findings showed that teachers' efficiency for new teachers increased significantly between the first and second years of teaching."}, {"section_title": "Gender as a Moderating Variable, Teachers' Job Satisfaction and Teachers' Retention in Public Secondary Schools in Anambra and Imo States", "text": "Sempane (2002) opined that job uniqueness add considerably to teacher's job satisfaction and retention. Working condition is a factor that influences teachers' job satisfaction and retention (Griffen 2002) . The environment in which people work has a great influence on their extent of self-importance for themselves and their job performance and retention .Working conditions are only likely to have a significant influence on job satisfaction when conditions are either extremely good or extremely poor. Mertler (2002) in a study on the levels of teacher satisfaction among middle and high school teachers. Findings showed that75% of the teachers, who were respondents, agreed that they were satisfied in teaching job .Further findings showed that gender significantly relate with job satisfaction and retention. Males teachers agreed a higher extent of satisfaction than female teachers and teachers previously in teaching profession showed a higher extent of job satisfaction and retention than teachers who were in the middle of teaching profession. Teachers in the age bracket of 26 to 30 years and 36 to 40 years agreed that they were more satisfied than teachers in other categories. Teachers with 1 to 5 years, 21 to 25 years and 31 to 35 experience as teachers agreed that they were more satisfaction than teachers in other categories. Teachers who had 6 to10 years of teaching experience agreed that have the lowest levels of satisfaction. The respondents agreed that they were motivated in the schools. Klassen (2010) in a study established that female teachers are more probable to experience job pressure from student misbehavior and workload stress than their male counterparts.\nPapin (2005) in a study on the elements that promote teachers' satisfaction in inner-city public school in Phoenix, Arisona. Findings showed that there was no link between teachers' satisfaction and gender or ranking. Again, there was a negative relationship between teacher satisfaction and retention based on age, salary, and years of experience. Al-Haydar & Bin Taleb (2005) in their study focused attention on the approach that teachers' have towards their job to multifaceted notions employed to establish the factors of teachers' job satisfaction and retention. Aspects of job uniqueness which have featured highly in text, comprise work itself, salary, supervision, promotion, interpersonal relation, and working conditions which has relationship with retention.\nO'Reilly (2014) in a study on teachers at work and the factors influencing satisfaction, retention and the professional well-being of elementary and secondary teachers at work and also of elementary and secondary educators. Findings showed that both inherent and extrinsic issues influence teachers' job performance and retention."}, {"section_title": "Location and Teachers' Retention in Public Secondary Schools in Anambra and Imo States", "text": "Xiao & Li (2003) , in their study established that teachers in urban location in China are liable to experience less satisfaction with their salary, but more pleased with their job protection, job background, and self-accomplishment . Steinhardt et al. (2011) established that that more experienced teachers in stress issues, as they seem to be able to manage related stress levels better than those with less experience. Adeyemi and Ogboro (2017) , in a study on the levels of deployment, utilisation and job performance of teachers in the public senior secondary schools in Edo state. Findings showed that there was low deployment, uneven distribution of graduate and retention of graduate teachers in rural and urban public secondary schools. Hanushek and Rivkin (2012) in their study on the distribution of teacher's quality and implications for policy. Findings showed that teachers tend to prefer schools with higher achieving students and appear to have heterogenoues preferences concerning school location and retention. Location, hiring and retaining quality teachers will be of vital importance to the public secondary schools in Anambra and Imo states in the 21 st century."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": "The study adopted ex-post facto design.

The sample of Anambra State public secondary schools was 100 principals and 735 teachers while the sample for Imo States public secondary schools was 150 principals and 1095 teachers. The stratified random sampling method was utilised to select 40 % of principals and 5 % of teachers in Anambra and Imo States That were used in the study. The research instrument that was used to collect data was an instrument titled -Relationship Between Job Satisfaction and Teachers' Retention Questionnaire\u2016 (RJSTRQ\ufd3f. Specialist authenticated the questionnaire and it was found reliable at 0.93. The researcher employed the services of research helpers who were educated on how to administer the instrument. The research helpers were informed on the purpose of the study, on how the respondents were expected to fill the instrument and the facts required in every item of the questionnaire. Four research aides helped the researcher in Anambra and Imo states respectively. Items on the questionnaire were scored with the four points scoring scale of Strongly Agree (4 points), Agree (3 points), Disagree (2 points) and Strongly Disagree (1 point). Out of 2,080 copies of the instruments administered, a total of 1806 copies were returned. Multiple regression and correlational information were employed to respond the four research questions and test the four null hypotheses formulated in the study at 0.05 rank of confidence. In testing hypothesis 1, the correlation model in table 1b showed that job satisfaction has significant relationship with teachers' retention. The calculated F = 1131.527, df (1, 1804), level of significance. The null hypothesis is therefore rejected and the alternative holds.
