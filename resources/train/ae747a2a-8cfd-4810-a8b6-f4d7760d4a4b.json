Whereas adverse effects of overweight on self-esteem, general psychological distress and quality of life have been observed in clinical samples of obese children, these findings have not generally been replicated in general population samples of children with comparable levels of obesity. 7, 8 Findings from population-based studies do suggest that associations between obesity and impairment in children's psycho-social functioning may be mediated by age and gender, with greater impairment in older children and in females. 7, 10 Few studies have addressed the possible effects of childhood obesity on other aspects of developmental functioning. A recent study of first-grade children in Germany (mean age \u00bc 6.7 years) 11 found that obesity was associated with impairment in motor development in both boys and girls, whereas Datar and Sturm (2004) , 12 in a large and nationally representative sample children beginning kindergarten in the US, found that obesity was associated with higher levels of teacher-and parent-reported behavior problems in girls, but not boys, after controlling for socio-demographic, lifestyle and family variables. In a separate analysis of data from the same sample, 13 it was found that overweight children had significantly lower scores on measures of mathematics and reading ability compared with non-overweight children.\nA study in Thailand found that overweight children and adolescents (mean age \u00bc 13.8 years) were twice as likely to perform poorly in mathematics and language tests as normal-weight children, after controlling for age, gender, school and grade. 14 The early years of school are a critical period in cognitive and motor development, during which time skills likely to impact on a broad range of functioning are acquired. 15 Impairment in developmental functioning during childhood may have adverse effects on self-esteem, psycho-social functioning more generally, and academic performance, as well as increasing the risk of obesity later in life. 10, 12 To date, the vast majority of studies that have examined associations between childhood overweight and impairment in specific aspects of functioning have been conducted in adolescents. Hence, where associations have been observed, it is unclear whether these effects were apparent earlier in the child's development and, if so, at what point. 7 The aim of the present study was to expand the current knowledge base by examining the behavioral correlates of obesity in a large community-based sample of pre-school children. Specifically, we considered the associations between obesity and the prevalence of impairments in motor, speech, cognitive and psychosocial development in nine consecutive cohorts of children residing in the Lower Bavaria region of Germany.

The same team of investigators, consisting of a medical doctor and two assistants, was employed over the duration of the study period and each examination was conducted by a trained specialist using the same manual. All members of the team were blind to the research questions. A modified version of the 'Bavarian Model' for school entry examinations 17 was employed that yielded data on physical and psychological health in four main developmental areas: motor, speech, cognition and psychosocial development. Date of the examination and date of birth of the child were used to obtain exact age at the examination. For body weight measurement, a standard scale was used, which was checked for accuracy according to requirements of the responsible institution after the examinations in 1998, 2000, 2002 and 2005. Other socio-demographic information, obtained by parent self-report, included number of siblings and duration and location (rural vs urban) of the kindergarten."}, {"section_title": "Definition of obesity", "text": "Obesity was defined according to the method proposed by Cole and co-workers, 18 in which the accepted cut-off for adult (at age 18 years) obesity is interpolated to yield ageand sex-specific cut-off points for obesity in children and adolescents aged 2-18 years. Hence, children with a BMI at or above the cut-off value corresponding to a BMI of 30 kg/ m 2 in late adolescence (for example, BMI of 19.8 for 6-yearold boys and 19.7 for 6-year-old girls) were classified as obese. This classification was based on the exact age of the children rounded to the nearest half year. Specific domains of functioning assessed and definitions of impairment Within each of the four broad areas of developmental functioning assessed, subdivisions were identified, each of which was assessed with one or more standardized tests. Table 1 shows the subdivisions of performance identified within each domain and the tests used to measure them. Motor development was considered to be impaired if problems (false performance or failure on) were observed in at least two standardized tests. Impairments of speech and cognition were recognized if a child was unable to perform correctly (false performance or failure in) in at least one of the standardized tests. Impairment in psychosocial functioning was recognized if a child showed at least one distinctive Obesity in pre-school children JM Mond et al deficit in performance in behavior, emotionality or psychomotor functioning according to the standardized tests. For technical reasons, data relating to impairment in subdivisions within the psychosocial domain were not available."}, {"section_title": "Statistical analysis", "text": "Bivariate associations between obesity and impairment in each of the 12 performance subdivisions were first examined by means of w 2 tests. Logistic regression models were used to examine associations between obesity and impairment in each subdivision while controlling for potential covariates, namely, age, gender, nationality, year of recruitment and location and duration of kindergarten. 17 Where the effects of both obesity and gender on performance in a given subdivision were significant, the analysis was repeated separately for males and females. A significance level (a) of Po0.05 was adopted for all tests and all analyses were conducted using SPSS Version 14.0.\nResults Table 2 shows the prevalence of impairments by gender. It can be seen that boys had significantly higher rates of impairment than girls in all performance subdivisions. Associations between obesity and the prevalence of specific impairments are shown in Table 3 . It can be seen that the prevalence of impairments was generally similar among obese and non-obese children, with the exception that impairment in gross motor skills tended to be higher among obese children than non-obese children (P \u00bc 0.08).\nResults of the initial regression analyses indicated that there was a significant association between obesity and impairment in gross motor skills (adjusted odds ratio \u00bc 1.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) \u00bc 1.06, 2.56, Po0.05), while the association between obesity and impairment in perseverance approached significance (adjusted odds ratio \u00bc 1.53, 95% CI \u00bc 0.97, 2.39, P \u00bc 0.07). Additional analysis indicated that obese male (but not female) children were more likely to have impairment in gross motor skills (adjusted odds ratio \u00bc 1.76, 95% CI \u00bc 1.02, 3.01, Po0.05), while obese female (but not male) children were more likely to have impairment in perseverance (adjusted odds ratio \u00bc 1.86, 95% CI \u00bc 1.00, 3.44, Po 0.05). There were no significant associations for any of the remaining subdivisions."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "We examined the associations between obesity and impairment in specific aspects of motor, speech, cognitive and psychosocial development in a large, population-based sample of pre-school children recruited in consecutive cohorts over a 9-year period. In the entire sample, there was a significant association between obesity and impairment in gross motor skills, after controlling for potential covariates. Additional analysis, in which the sample was stratified by gender, indicated that the prevalence of impairment in gross motor skills was higher among obese male children than normal-weight male children, whereas the prevalence of impairment in perseverance, namely, the ability to focus attention continuously during the examination, was higher in obese female children than normalweight female children. Obesity in pre-school children JM Mond et al"}, {"section_title": "Strengths and limitations", "text": "There were a number of notable strengths of the present study. First, this is one of the few population-based studies to consider associations between obesity and developmental functioning in younger children. To our knowledge, the US Early Childhood Longitudinal Study 10 is the only other population-based study of pre-school children comparable in terms of sample size. Second, the same rigorous, standardized assessment procedures, were employed at each assessment during the entire study period. Third, impairment in a range of aspects of developmental functioning was considered. Fourth, we were able to control for a range of potential covariates that previous research suggested may be associated both with overweight and with impairment in one or more performance subdivisions. 17 Finally, an internationally accepted definition of obesity was employed.\nLimitations of the present research should also be noted. First, the definitions of impairment employed did not conform to any recognized international standard. Findings relating to the absolute levels of impairment should therefore be interpreted with caution. Second, for technical reasons, data for performance on specific subdivisions within the psycho-social domain could not be considered. Associations between obesity and impairment in specific aspects of psycho-social functioning may have been observed were these data available. Third, the use of a cross-sectional design limits any inferences concerning the direction of the observed relationships. Impairment in specific aspects of functioning might be either the cause or the effect of overweight, or both. 19 Alternatively, obesity and impairment in psycho-social and other outcomes might both be the product of other factors, such as socio-demographic and/or behavioral variables. 12, 13 Even where a prospective design is employed, it may be difficult to draw firm conclusions as to cause and effect. 10, 20 Associations between obesity and impairment in specific aspects of functioning We found that obesity was associated with impairment in (gross) motor skills, after potential covariates were statistically controlled. Children with poorer motor skills may be less likely to participate in organized and recreational physical activities, due to perceived stigma and/or lack of Obesity in pre-school children JM Mond et al confidence, thereby increasing the risk of obesity. 11 Alternatively, participation in a higher level and range of activities from an early age may be conducive to both improved motor skills and healthy weight maintenance. In the present study, obesity was associated with impairment in motor skills only in male children. Cairney and co-workers 21 similarly found a significant association between obesity and impairment in developmental coordination for boys, but not girls, in a sample of elementary school children (ages 9-14 years). Findings from both studies may reflect greater societal pressure for participation in physical activities and/or athletic prowess in boys. 21 The only other significant association between overweight and developmental functioning was that the prevalence of impairment in perseverance, namely, the capacity to focus attention during the examination, was higher in obese girls than non-obese girls. Findings from other studies also suggest that obesity is associated with impairment in cognitive functioning and other adverse outcomes in girls but not boys. 10, 12, [22] [23] [24] [25] These findings may reflect, at least in part, higher levels of weight concerns and/or a greater susceptibility to weight-related teasing/stigmatization in girls. 7, 10 In any case, the findings of the present study indicate the need to monitor the developmental functioning of obese children, both boys and girls, to recognize the developmental, as well as the medical, consequences of childhood overweight, and to implement early intervention programs to optimize children's health. 11, 25, 26 In the present study, there was no association between obesity and impairment in psycho-social development in either boys or girls. In view of the limitation associated with the assessment of this domain noted previously, this finding should be interpreted with caution. However, associations between obesity and impairment in psycho-social functioning have not generally been observed in unselected samples of children and adolescents, in contrast to the marked impairment observed in clinical samples. 7 Hence, and paralleling obesity research in adults, 9 attention has turned to the factors that might mediate the effects of childhood obesity on specific aspects of functioning. 7, 27 These factors are likely to include the degree of overweight, 28 chronic medical conditions and/or pain, 29, 30 body image dissatisfaction, 22, 10 and personality variables such as resiliency and coping style. 31, 25 Although the focus of the present study was on associations between obesity and impairment in developmental functioning, two other findings are notable. First, the prevalence of obesity in girls was almost double that of its prevalence in boys. A recent study of children aged 5 to 12 years in Ireland similarly found higher rates of obesity in girls than in boys, 32 whereas other studies of younger children have found no difference 33 or higher prevalence in boys. 34 These discrepancies likely reflect the different ages of the populations sampled in different studies as well as the fact that levels of overweight and obesity in younger children are particularly susceptible to the effects of different possible definitions of these terms. 32 Second, in all domains, and in each performance subdivisions within each domain, the prevalence of impairment was higher in boys than in girls. This finding is consistent with findings from a number of population-based studies indicating that the prevalence of disruptive disorders is higher in boys than in girls. [35] [36] [37] Disorders of this kind are among the most common psychiatric conditions in younger children and are associated with a range of comorbid conditions, including learning difficulties. 35, 37, 38 To conclude, in a large general population sample of preschool children, the prevalence of impairment in gross motor skills was higher among obese male children than normal-weight male children, whereas the prevalence of impairment in the ability to focus attention was higher in obese female children than normal-weight female children. The findings suggest that gender-specific associations between overweight and impairment in specific aspects of developmental functioning are evident in this younger population."}]
