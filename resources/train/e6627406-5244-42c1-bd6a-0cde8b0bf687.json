[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Depressive symptoms are frequently seen in patients with dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Evidence suggests that there may be a link between current depressive symptoms and Alzheimer disease (AD)-associated pathological changes, such as an increase in cortical amyloid-b (Ab). However, limited in vivo studies have explored the relationship between current depressive symptoms and cortical Ab in patients with MCI and AD. Our study, using a large sample of 455 patients with MCI and 153 patients with AD from the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiatives, investigated whether current depressive symptoms are related to cortical Ab deposition. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Geriatric Depression Scale and Neuropsychiatric Inventory-depression/dysphoria. Cortical Ab was quantified using positron emission tomography with the Ab probe 18 F-florbetapir (AV-45). 18 F-florbetapir standardized uptake value ratio (AV-45 SUVR) from the frontal, cingulate, parietal, and temporal regions was estimated. A global AV-45 SUVR, defined as the average of frontal, cingulate, precuneus, and parietal cortex, was also used. We observed that current depressive symptoms were not related to cortical Ab, after controlling for potential confounds, including history of major depression. We also observed that there was no difference in cortical Ab between matched participants with high and low depressive symptoms, as well as no difference between matched participants with the presence and absence of depressive symptoms. The association between depression and cortical Ab deposition does not exist, but the relationship is highly influenced by stressful events in the past, such as previous depressive episodes, and complex interactions of different pathways underlying both depression and dementia."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "There is mounting evidence in support of a link among depression, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer disease (AD). [1] [2] [3] [4] Depressive symptoms occur very commonly in patients with MCI, 5 with previous findings reporting that the comorbidity rate is approximately 44%. 6 Current literature suggests that depression in MCI is a strong risk factor for AD. 7, 8 A lifetime history of depression (LMD) confers an increased risk of developing AD, and a single episode of late-life depression increases the risk of developing AD by 4-to 5-fold. 9 Studies have shown that patients with MCI having depressive symptoms are more likely to develop AD than those without depression. 10, 11 A recent study noted that currently patients with depression having MCI, who have elevated amyloid-b (Ab) in the frontotemporal region, are more likely to convert to AD than nondepressed patients. 12 These aforementioned findings suggest a complex relationship among depression, MCI, and AD.\nFurther, depression is strongly linked with the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disorders. 13, 14 One study demonstrated that patients with AD having an LMD have higher hippocampal deposits of Ab than those without an LMD. 15 In addition, our group recently showed that patients with MCI having an LMD had higher Ab accumulation mainly in the bilateral frontal region in comparison to those without an LMD. 16 Therefore, the literature suggests that past depressive episodes are associated with elevated Ab level in patients with MCI and AD.\nNevertheless, the relationship between current depressive symptoms and Ab deposition in MCI remains to be characterized. Although several studies of peripheral Ab levels in the elderly patients have not demonstrated an association between Ab and current depressive symptoms, [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] there are others suggesting a positive relationship. [22] [23] [24] Moreover, there are no studies that have examined the relationship between symptoms of depression and cortical Ab levels. It is also important to note that previous studies did not clearly distinguish LMD from the current depressive symptoms. At least 50% of patients who recover from their first depressive episode will have additional episodes, and approximately 80% of those with LMD will have recurrent episodes. 25, 26 These inconsistent findings suggest that the association between current depressive episode and Ab level may be attributable to past depressive episodes rather than current depressive symptoms. Therefore, it is critically important to investigate the association between cortical Ab accumulation and current depressive symptoms while controlling for the confounding effect of LMD to understand the role of AD pathology in patients with MCI and AD who have comorbid depression.\nPresently, cortical Ab deposition can be measured with positron emission tomography (PET) using radiotracers such as 18F-florbetapir (AV-45). 27 A recent finding using PET-AV-45 demonstrated that in patients with depression, Ab accumulation is increased in frontal, temporal, and parietal regions, in comparison to nondepressed patients. 28 In addition, there is evidence of elevated Ab accumulation in the cingulate region in patients with depression. 29 In this study, investigating these 4 a priori regions-frontal, temporal, parietal, and cingulatewe examined cortical Ab deposition in 455 patients with MCI and 153 patients with AD from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiatives (ADNI) 30 databases. The primary objective was to assess the relationship between cortical Ab deposition in the 4 aforementioned regions of interests (ROIs) and current depressive symptoms, controlling for LMD in vivo. Findings from this study will further characterize the relationship between current depressive symptoms and cortical Ab deposition in patients with MCI and AD. Negative results would suggest that current depressive symptoms in MCI and AD might be explained by multiple factors independent of Ab pathology."}, {"section_title": "Method", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study Patients and Diagnosis", "text": "The entire data set was downloaded from ADNI-1, ADNI-2, and ADNI Grand Opportunity (ADNI-GO) databases on March 29, 2014. 30 The ROI-based AV-45 data set that we used was updated as of May 2, 2014.

The GDS 33 and NPI 34 were obtained from ADNI-1, ADNI-2, and ADNI-GO. The GDS Short-Form is a 15-item self-assessment addressing depressive symptoms in elderly individuals. 35 Its score ranges from 0 to 15, 15 referring to the most severe depressive symptoms, scores 5 or above are suggestive of depression, and scores 10 or above almost always indicate depression. 36 The GDS is a valid and reliable way of measuring depressive symptoms in patients with MCI. 37 For our study, the cutoff score used to distinguish between ''low depressed'' and ''high depressed'' was 5. The NPI-D was assessed using information from primary caretakers or informants of the participants. The severity score of NPI-D is classified into ''mild,'' ''moderate,'' or ''severe'' (score 1-3), and the frequency into ''less than once a week,'' ''once a week,'' ''most days but not every day,'' and ''every day'' (score 1-4). 38 The score of NPI-D is the product of severity and frequency of the depressive symptoms and has a range from 0 to 12. The NPI-D also has high validity and good reliability in measuring depressive symptoms in elderly individuals. 39 For our study, the definition of ''absence of depressive symptoms'' was having a score of 0 in both GDS and NPI-D scores and ''presence of depressive symptom'' as having a score 1 or above in both GDS and NPI-D scores. Participants who showed inconsistency in their scores were excluded. Medical history of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), psychiatric disorders (PDs), neurological disorders (NDs), metabolic disorders (MDs), smoking, and alcohol and drug abuse was obtained by trained research assistants from patients with MCI and AD, their caretakers or informants during ADNI screening, and during follow-up visits. 40 This was similarly done for ADNI-1, ADNI-GO, and ADNI-2. The presence of an LMD was determined using patients' self-reported medical history from ADNI-1, ADNI-GO, and ADNI-2.

Analyses were performed after controlling for aforementioned demographic and clinical factors.\nAdditionally, analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs) were performed for each group of patients with MCI and AD. We used 2 different approaches for ANCOVA. For the first approach, we separated participants based on low depressive symptom and high depressive symptom based on their GDS score. Then, participants with low depressive symptom were matched to those with high depressive symptom based on their demographic and clinical profiles. The 2 groups were matched for ApoE4 genotype, gender, race, ethnicity, marital status, MMSE score, and education years. For each participant with high depressive symptoms, 3 matched participants with low depressive symptoms were selectively found, and an ANCOVA was carried out controlling for any factor that was significantly different (P < .05) or at a trend level of difference between the 2 groups (P < .10).

Symptoms of depression were assessed with the GDS and NPI-D, 2 instruments widely used in the elderly, and AV-45 SUVR was used as a surrogate measure of cortical Ab deposition in 4 ROIs: frontal, cingulate, parietal, and temporal regions. There was no association between current depressive symptoms and cortical Ab levels, after controlling for multiple confounding factors, such as age and gender. Current literature highlights that there is a link between depression and atrophies in several cortical regions, 46, 47 such as hippocampus and orbitofrontal cortex. In order to account for potential atrophies in patients with depressive symptoms, controlling for total brain volume in the Pearson partial correlation did not influence the relationship between current depressive symptoms and cortical Ab levels. The Ab protein hypothesis of AD states that increased production of Ab plaques is the first step in the molecular cascade, ultimately leading to the impaired functions that manifest in dementia. 48 This hypothesis proposes that amyloid accumulation in the brain occurs before the clinical symptoms and functional impairment of dementia. Brain atrophy is linked to cortical Ab level only in the pre-MCI stage but not in MCI and AD stages, 49 suggesting that cortical Ab deposition and neuronal loss start prior to clinical evidence of cognitive decline. In addition, a recent study proposed that the rate of cortical Ab deposition slows down over the course of life, whereas the process of neurodegeneration accelerates. 50 A recent prospective study further reinforced that the process of cortical Ab accumulation is extremely slow and protracted, showing approximately 3% of increased deposition per year. 51 Therefore, current depressive symptoms in patients with established MCI or AD are less likely to be associated with the cortical Ab level. Findings from a recent study by our group suggest that in patients with MCI, an LMD is linked to an increase in cortical Ab deposition in the frontal region. 16 Our previous and current findings strongly suggest that LMD is a stronger predictor of cortical Ab accumulation than current depressive state in patients with MCI or AD. Overall, we can speculate that although LMD is strongly associated with cortical Ab accumulation, current depressive symptoms might have an underlying pathology independent of Ab neuropathological changes.\nOur results are in accordance with a number of previous studies that did not find a relationship between depression and Ab deposition. In a neuropathological study of older adults, increased Ab accumulation was not associated with current depression. 52 In a recent investigation, NPI-D score was unrelated to cortical Ab deposition in patients with AD (n \u00bc 28). 53 Similarly, another group concluded that depression was not associated with more severe AD-type pathology in patients with SCI and MCI. 18 Moreover, another study observed no correlation between current Hamilton Depression Scale score and Ab42 level in patients with late-life depression. 54 The mechanism underlying why depressive symptoms are common in patients with MCI and AD is still elusive. Nevertheless, our current finding reinforces the recent hypothesis that states elevated risk of AD in old patients with depressive symptoms may not be due to abnormalities in Ab deposition but rather due to reduced brain reserve secondary to pathological changes in patients. 21 According to this hypothesis, Ab accumulation makes brains vulnerable to other neurotoxic events that may result in emergence of symptoms of dementia. These events include reduced neurotrophic factors, 55 elevated oxidative stress markers, elevated cortisol, higher white matter intensity volume, and neuroinflammation. 21 Therefore, our negative result is in agreement with both the Ab hypothesis of AD, proposed by Diniz et al, and a finding that suggests that MCI in late-life depression may be caused by non-AD pathology, such as vascular changes in the brain. 56 Overall, based on previous literature and our current finding, we conclude that the association between depression and cortical Ab deposition does not exist, but the relationship is highly influenced by the presence of LMD, heterogeneity of participants, and complex interactions of different pathways underlying both depression and dementia.\nThere are several limitations to this study. First, there was inconsistency between NPI-D and GDS measures of depression. Based on participants' NPI-D score, more than half of the study participants included in ADNI did not have depressive symptoms, whereas according to GDS score, the majority of patients with MCI and AD had symptoms of depression. This inconsistency may be attributable to methodological differences between the scales. The GDS is a self-report measure, and NPI-D is based on information provided by participants' caregivers or informants. The NPI-D is a more objective measure of participants' depressive symptoms and is less affected by subject bias or cognitive decline. The GDS and NPI-D scores were modestly correlated in MCI and AD groups (n \u00bc 455, r \u00bc 0.25, P < .01 and n \u00bc 153, r \u00bc 0.19, P \u00bc .03, respectively). In order to increase the sensitivity of measuring depressive symptoms, we combined the 2 scales, especially as depression contains both subjective and objective clinical features. Second, few patients had severe depressive symptoms, which is attributable to the ADNI protocol's preferential inclusion of patients with GDS less than 6. The majority of patients had mild to moderate or no symptoms of depression. The inclusion of patients with severe depression could have provided a wider range of symptoms and more conclusive analyses. Third, given that cortical Ab deposition reaches a plateau in the early illness phase of AD, 51 our study was limited in that we restricted our cohort to patients who had their PET scan and clinical assessment within a close temporal proximity. By including more patients, we could have increased the statistical power of our study. Fourth, we did not investigate the relationship between cortical Ab accumulation and antidepressant usage. There is one study showing that antidepressants may reduce cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Ab production in healthy individuals and transgenic AD mice. 57 Future studies need to investigate how antidepressant usage influences cortical Ab deposition in patients with MCI and AD. Lastly, the selection bias created by matching participants may influence group differences. To address this, we utilized 3 matched groups to allow comparisons between the 3 groups. Fifth, one of the inclusion criteria of participants in ADNI is their baseline GDS score less than six 58 ; excluding patients who are depressed based on their GDS scores may be another limitation, which may reduce the sample sizes of participants with depression and mask the relationship between depressive symptoms and cortical Ab levels. However, in our study, we did not restrict our inclusion criteria only to patients at baseline but also included patients with PET-AV-45 scan and clinical assessments at any time point (ie, 2 years after the baseline). This method allowed us to increase the patient samples and statistical power. Sixth, the causality between the level of cortical Ab and depressive symptoms may be bidirectional. There is evidence of infusion of Ab peptides inducing depressive-like behaviors in mice. 59, 60 Although these were rodent studies, it is very important to investigate whether there is a bidirectional relationship between depressive symptoms and Ab levels in humans. We did not look into the potential role of Ab promoting depression, and future studies should investigate this relationship.\nSeventh, our finding shows no correlation between current depressive symptoms and cortical Ab levels in 4 ROIs that showed increased Ab deposition in populations with depression. In addition to ROI analyses, future studies should take a voxel-based approach to confirm whether any other regions show elevated cortical Ab levels that may be related to current depressive symptoms. Eighth, MCI has heterogeneous etiologies; thus, patients with MCI have different causes explaining their illness state. In order to eliminate this confounding effect of heterogeneity of MCI, we classified patients with MCI into either ''MCI due to AD'' (n \u00bc 281) or ''MCI not due to AD'' (n \u00bc 91) based on their biomarker criteria, including positive cortical Ab and high CSF phosphorylated tau, as suggested by previous studies. 51, 61 In each group, there was no relationship between current depressive symptoms, assessed by GDS and NPI-D score, and cortical Ab deposition in frontal, parietal, cingulate and temporal regions ( Supplementary Table 5a and b). Thus, current depressive symptoms were not linked to cortical Ab, regardless of different etiologies of MCI. Lastly, future prospective studies investigating the changes in Ab levels over time in patients with depression versus nondepressed patients should be carried out to verify no difference in the rate of amyloidogenesis between the 2 groups. This finding will further reinforce that cortical Ab deposition is not influenced by late-life depressive symptoms.\nIn conclusion, using a large sample size, we did not find a relationship between current depressive symptoms and cortical Ab accumulation in patients with MCI and AD. This finding suggests that the mechanisms associated with current depressive symptoms in AD-MCI may be different from AD pathology."}, {"section_title": "Appendix A", "text": "The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) was launched in 2003 by the National Institute on Aging (NIA), the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), private pharmaceutical companies, and nonprofit organizations, as a $60 million, 5-year public private partnership.
