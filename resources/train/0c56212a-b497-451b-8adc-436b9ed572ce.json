[{"section_title": "", "text": "and Figure 1 , COVID-19 has caused 82 623 confirmed cases and 2858 deaths globally. The total case-fatality rate is 3.46% as shown in Table 1 . Because COVID-19 started from Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei province with a large population of nearly 14 million people, 58.3% cases are in Wuhan. A total of 1932 health workers have been infected in Wuhan alone, 9 which overwhelmed the local health system and resulted in the highest case-fatality rate (4.42%). Excluding Hubei province, the rest of China has 13 045 cases, 109 fatalities (0.84%). Outside of China, COVID-19 has spread to 46 countries and has caused 3664 infections and 67 fatalities (1.83%). Overall, the case-fatality rate of COVID-19 so far is much lower than either SARS (9.6%) or MERS (34.5%). 10 Here, we summarized common and discrete features of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to its two predecessors (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) in genetics, epidemiology, clinical features, and further discussed challenges for diagnosis and special control measures for COVID-19."}, {"section_title": "| GENETIC BIOLOGY OF SARS-COV-2", "text": "Full-length genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 were obtained from early infected individuals related to a wild animal market in Wuhan by different research groups through next-generation sequencing. 1, 2, 11 Full genomic length of this novel coronavirus ranges from 29 891 to 29 903 nucleotides (nt). 2 1, 2, 11 The close phylogenetic relationship to RaTG13 suggests bats are probably natural hosts for SARS-CoV-2. 2 Human SARS-CoV-2 have a unique RRAR motif in the spike protein which is not found in coronaviruses isolated from pangolins, suggesting SARS-CoV-2 may not come directly from pangolins. 12 An evolutionary study 13 based on 86 genomic sequences from GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org/) showed three deletions were found in isolates from Japan, USA, and Australia, 93 mutations found over the entire genomes. Of note, eight mutations were found in the spike surface glycoprotein, especially three mutations (D 354 , Y 364 , and F 367 ) located in the spike surface glycoprotein receptor-binding domain (RBD), which suggested SARS-CoV-2 may rapidly evolve to evade immune response and adapt to other hosts in the future. SARS-CoV-2 share 79% nt sequence identity to SARS-CoV and around 50% to MERS-CoV. 2 However, the seven conserved replicase domains in ORF1ab (used for CoV species classification) of SARS-CoV-2 are 94.6% identical to SARS-CoV, implying the two belong to same species. 1, 2 The receptor-binding protein spike (S) gene of SARS-CoV-2 is highly divergent to all previously described SARSr-CoVs with less than 75% nt sequence identity to except a 93.1% nt identity to RaTG13. Homology modeling revealed SARS-CoV-2 had a similar RBD structure to that of SARS-CoV. 11 Further study showed SARS-CoV-2 uses the same cell entry receptor, ACE2, as SARS-CoV, not CD26 as MERS-CoV. 2 Structural analysis by cryo-electron microscopy revealed SARS-CoVs protein binds ACE2 with 10 to 20 folds higher affinity than SARS-CoV, 14 which suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may be more infectious to human than SARS-CoV."}, {"section_title": "| EPIDEMIOLOGY OF COVID-19", "text": "Transmission of infectious diseases must rely on three conditions: sources of infection, routes of transmission, and susceptible hosts. 21 With enforced implementation of isolation strategies, R 0 was expected to decline in coming days. The mean incubation period was around 6.4 days (ranges from 0 to 24 days). 19, 22 Similar to SARS and MERS, nosocomial transmission was a severe problem to COVID-19, and even worse. A recent retrospective study 9 indicated that a total of 1716 health workers were infected, accounting for 3.84% of total cases. Nosocomial infections extremely burdened the health system and hindered early infected individuals from getting immediate medical supports, therefore resulting in high case-fatality rate in Wuhan as shown in Table 1 Vertical transmission was sporadically reported in some media\nbut not yet proved.
