Doctorate recipients whose postgraduation status involves either returning to their predoctoral position or accepting a new position are considered to have definite commitments for a position in the coming year. The proportion of doctorate recipients reporting definite commitments is an indicator of the overall strength of the job market for doctorate recipients and the availability of positions relative to the supply of new doctorate recipients. The job market for doctorate recipients varies according to the citizenship status of doctorate recipients (figure 2). Each year from 1999 to 2009, U.S. citizens were more likely (by an annual average difference of 3.3 percentage points) than temporary visa holders to have definite postgraduation commitments for a position, and each year temporary visa holders were more likely (by an annual average difference of 5.1 percentage points) than permanent residents to report definite commitments. Although doctorate recipients in the three citizenship categories differ with respect to their rates of definite commitments, the data trends for the three groups have been similar. The proportions of definite commitments were at high points in 2001 and 2006 for all three citizenship groups, and 2007 to 2009 marked a low period for all three. Direct comparison of pre-2007 data on definite postgraduation commitments with later data should be made with caution, however, as one response category for the postgraduation status item-signed contract or commitment for a new position-was changed beginning with the 2007 SED, which may have resulted in an overstatement of the rate of definite commitments in the pre-2007 data (see \"Data Sources and Limitations,\" below). Consequently, the remainder of this discussion focuses on the 2007 to 2009 period.  1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009  groups. The proportion of U.S. citizen doctorate recipients reporting definite commitments remained essentially unchanged, the rate of permanent resident doctorate recipients with definite commitments declined slightly (-0.8 percentage points), and the percentage of temporary visa holder doctorate recipients with definite commitments increased slightly (0.7 percentage points). The job market has been relatively stronger for doctorate recipients in some fields of study than in others (table  3). The rate of definite commitments among doctorate recipients in physical sciences, social sciences, education, health, and professional fields exceeded 70% in every year from 2007 to 2009. Humanities and life sciences doctorate recipients had the lowest rates of definite commitments, at or below 65% in those years. The year-to-year changes also varied by field of study. In every non-S&E field of study, the percentage of doctorate recipients reporting definite commitments increased from 2007 to 2008, whereas the proportion of definite commitments declined in 2008 or stayed roughly the same for doctorate recipients in every S&E field except social sciences. From 2008 to 2009, the overall rate of definite commitments for all fields fell by 0.5 percentage points, with declines in every field except social sciences and life sciences. The data suggest that the 2009 job market for new doctorate recipients was only slightly weaker than in 2008 and was essentially the same as in 2007, the year before the advent of the recession. A closer look at the data on postgraduation status provides mixed indicators of the state of the job market for new doctorate recipients from 2007 to 2009. The data show a declining proportion of doctorate recipients returning to predoctoral positions, as the overall rate fell 1.0 percentage point from 2007 to 2009 (table 3). 4 Over the same period, however, the overall proportion of doctorate recipients having definite commitments for a new position increased by a comparable amount (0.9 percentage points), and the overall rate at which doctorate recipients reported they were still seeking a position decreased slightly (0.5 percentage points). Compared with 2008, employment conditions in 2009 were worse for non-S&E doctorate recipients than for S&E doctorate recipients. In every non-S&E field, 2009 doctorate recipients were less likely to have a signed contract or commitment for a new position and were more likely to report they were still seeking a position than were 2008 doctorate recipients. 2009 S&E doctorate recipients in every field except engineering were more likely than their 2008 counterparts to have a signed contract or commitment for a new position. However, when the 2009 data are compared with the 2007 (prerecession) data, no strong claims can be made about the different employment conditions faced by S&E versus non-S&E doctorate recipients. The \"other postgraduation status\" category includes doctorate recipients who do not plan to work or study in the coming year and, beginning in 2007, doctorate recipients who plan to pursue another full-time degree program. Since 2007, other postgraduation status has become a more frequently reported postgraduation plan of doctorate recipients in all fields of study except education and professional fields, where the percentages declined slightly. The higher rate of this response among doctorate recipients in life sciences may be attributable to doctorate recipients who are in joint MD/PhD programs and are still in school for the MD degree."}, {"section_title": "Type of Position", "text": "Four types of positions are discussed here: postdoc position, employed position in academe, employed position in industry/business, and other employed position. 5 The overall trends from 2004 to 2009 (table 4) show that doctorate recipients are increasingly likely to accept postdoc positions (2.8 percentage points) and employed positions in industry/business (1.9 percentage points), and are less likely to take positions in academe (-3.2 percentage points) and other employment (-1.6 percentage points). 2009 had the largest single-year increase in the proportion of doctorate recipients taking postdoc positions during the 5-year span (2.0 percentage points) and the largest single-year decrease in the rate of academic employment (-1.4 percentage points). Over the past 5 years the data trends within each type of position have varied by field of study. Historically, postdoc positions have been far more common among S&E doctorate recipients than among doctorate recipients in education, humanities, and professional fields. In every S&E field, the proportion of doctorate recipients accepting postdoc positions declined from 2004 to 2006 and then increased from 2006 to 2009. In every S&E field except social sciences, the largest singleyear increase in the proportion of doctorate recipients accepting postdoc positions occurred in 2009. Although postdoc positions remain relatively uncommon in humanities and professional fields, the proportion of     Numbers of Doctorates Awarded Continue to Grow in 2009... doctorate recipients in those fields taking postdoc positions has increased over the period 2004-09. Employment in academe is the most likely early career destination for doctorate recipients in non-S&E fields, and also for social sciences doctorate recipients. However, the proportion of doctorate recipients taking positions in academe declined over the period 2004-09 in every non-S&E field except professional fields and in every S&E field except life sciences. The drop from 2008 to 2009 in the rate of academic employment resulted from decreases in life sciences (-1.2 percentage points), engineering (-3.6 percent points), and humanities (-1.1 percentage points). The rate of employment in academe increased in 2009 for doctorate recipients in health and physical sciences, by 3.4 and 0.4 percentage points, respectively. Employment in industry/business is the most likely initial destination for new doctorate recipients in engineering and is also a common postgraduation position for new doctorate recipients in physical sciences. In both of these fields, and in life sciences, the proportion of doctorate recipients taking employed positions in industry/business increased from 2004 to 2008 and then decreased in 2009. The proportion of humanities doctorate recipients taking industry/business positions dropped slightly over the 2004-09 period, but none of the remaining fields showed a discernible trend over the past 5 years. A large and nearly constant proportion of doctorate recipients in education secured positions in other employment over the period 2004-09. (This is to be expected, as employment in \"preschool, elementary, middle, secondary school or school system\" is one of the survey response categories aggregated within the other employed position category.) In every non-education field but engineering, the proportion of doctorate recipients taking other employed positions increased from 2004 to 2006, and then (including engineering) decreased or did not change from 2006 to 2009."}, {"section_title": "Data Sources and Limitations", "text": "The data presented here are from the Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED) for academic year 2009 (1 July 2008 to 30 June 2009). The SED is sponsored by six federal agencies: the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services), the U.S. Department of Education, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Each individual completing requirements for a research doctorate from a university in the United States or Puerto Rico receives the SED. Research doctoral programs are oriented toward preparing students to make original contributions to knowledge in a field and typically entail writing a dissertation. Doctoral degrees such as the PhD, DSc, and research EdD are considered research doctorates and are covered by this survey; professional degrees (e.g., MD, DDS, JD, and PsyD) are not. The terms \"doctorate\" and \"doctoral degree\" are used to represent any of the research doctoral degrees covered by the survey. In 2009, 92.3% of the 49,562 new doctorate recipients completed the survey. Limited records are constructed for nonrespondents from administrative lists of the university, such as commencement programs and graduation lists. Consequently, the 2009 item response rates for some items exceed the 92.3% unit response rate: the field of study information used in this report was obtained for all doctorate recipients, information on sex was obtained for 99.9%, race/ethnicity for 94.1%, and citizenship status for 94.7%. The response rate for the postgraduation status item over the period reported in table 3 ranged from 92.2% in 2006 to 89.6% in 2009. The major fields and subfields of study are reported differently in this InfoBrief than in the SED questionnaire instrument and the interagency report Doctorate Recipients from U.S. Universities: 2009 (forthcoming). In this InfoBrief, the major field \"health\" is in the non-S&E category rather than in S&E. The fine fields American/ U.S. studies; archeology; and history, science, and technology and society are counted in social sciences (S&E category) rather than humanities (non-S&E category). Agricultural economics is included in social sciences rather than agricultural sciences. Finally, public administration is counted in social sciences (S&E category) rather than professional fields (non-S&E category). Before 2007 the \"signed contract\" response category to the postgraduation status item was worded, \"Have signed contract or made definite commitment for other work or study.\" Commitments for a postdoc position and commitments for a full-time degree program could both be considered commitments for \"study.\" Thus, to distinguish these commitments the wording of this response category was changed in 2007 to \"have signed contract or made definite commitment for a 'postdoc' or other work,\" and a new response category, \"other full-time degree program,\" was added to the postgraduation status item. In this report, \"other full-time degree program\" responses are aggregated within the \"other postgraduation status\" reporting category. Changes in the proportions of doctorate recipients in the \"other postgraduation status\" and \"signed contract\" categories beginning 2007 may be partly attributable to the changed wording of the survey item. As a result, the pre-2007 percentages of doctorate recipients indicating the \"have signed contract\" response are slightly overstated in comparison with the 2007 to 2009 data because the figures include an indeterminate number of respondents who might have selected the \"other fulltime degree program\" response had it been available. Similarly, the pre-2007 percentages of doctorate recipients in the \"other postgraduation status\" category are slightly understated in comparison with the later data. The full set of detailed tables from this survey, providing more information on doctorates awarded in S&E fields, will appear in Doctorate Recipients from U.S. Universities: 2009 and forthcoming reports of the Science and Engineering Doctorate Awards series, at http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/doctorates/. Individual detailed tables from recent surveys may be available in advance of publication of the full reports. For further information, please contact the author. 2. Minority groups include American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian, black, Hispanic (Mexican American, Puerto Rican, and other Hispanic ethnicities), Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander, persons who reported two or more races, and other race/ethnicity. 3. On the SED, postdoc is defined as \"a temporary position primarily for gaining additional education and training in research, usually awarded in academe, industry, government, or a non-profit organization.\" Some institutions consider postdocs to be employment, whereas other institutions consider them to be \"study.\" 4. Returning to predoctoral employment is a common postgraduation plan of doctorate recipients in education and (to a lesser extent) health, as many doctoral programs in these fields enroll graduate students who pursue the degree on a part-time basis and remain employed during their doctoral studies. 5. The use of the term \"employed position\" is intended to distinguish postdoc from non-postdoc positions, and is not meant to suggest that a postdoc position is not a form of employment."}]
