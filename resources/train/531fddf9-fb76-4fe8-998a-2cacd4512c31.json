[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The purposes of this study were to establish a school support service model for students with disabilities in general classroom, and to explore the current status of school support services provided for students with disabilities in preschools, primary, and junior high schools. Therefore, this study used data from the Special Needs Education\nLongitudinal Study in Taiwan, collected in the 2007-2008 academic year. There were 2,924 students with disabilities selected in the study who were placed in general classrooms; 855 were in preschool, 1,079 were in primary school and 990 were in junior high school. The questionnaires in the database were answered by their teachers. The results of this study are listed, as follows: In terms of the school support service model for students with disabilities in the three stages of education, adjustment in teaching accounts for 1~15% of the explanatory power regarding the overall model, while support services account for 63~85%, which peak in junior high schools.\nSecondly, itinerant teachers are found to be the most important human resource in preschools. For primary and junior high schools, parents and special education teachers are the more prevalent influences. The more common school support services are tuition refunds, itinerant services, adjustments in examinations, and scholarships."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "According to a report of U.S. Department of Education regarding the educational environments of students with disabilities aged 6 through 21 in 2010, students spending 80% or more of the day in a regular classroom account for 60.5% of the total, those spending 40~79% of the day in a regular classroom account for 20.1%, while those spending less than 40% of the day in a regular classroom account for 14.2% (U.S. Department of Education, 2014) . This means that as many as 94.8% of students with disabilities were educated in regular classroom, while enjoying various special education services. This leaves only 5.2% of students with disabilities educated in special schools, facilities, and homebound education services. However, these studies found that some regular classroom teachers in primary and secondary schools argued against the idea that all students with disabilities were suitable for regular education (Cook, 2001; Cook, 2004; Varma, 2007) . Moreover, it was the opinion of some regular classroom teachers that most students with disabilities were incapable of mastering what they learned in a regular 1065 (Coffey & Obringer, 2004; Jindal-Snape, Douglas, Topping, Kerr, & Smith, 2005; Koenig, Bleiweiss, Brennan, Cohen, & Siegel, 2009) .\nThe Special Needs Education Longitudinal Study (abbreviated as SNELS) is a longitudinal database for students with disabilities, which was established to collect the data of individuals with disabilities, their families, and schools in the four stages of education, preschool, primary school, junior high school, and senior high school in a comprehensive and longitudinal manner, thus, facilitating investigations into the important issues for the education of individuals with disabilities. SNELS is mainly characterized by: (1) the inclusion of the fifteen-year-long longitudinal studies of students with disabilities regarding their education or exit from education; (2) longitudinal studies of students with disabilities spanning 3~5 years, thus, enabling comparisons and analysis of cross-year data; and (3) collection of information on the administrative implementation of special education services by the department of education at the county (municipal) level, thus, providing a full picture of the education of individuals with disabilities in Taiwan (Academia Sinica, 2014) .\nTherefore, this study was to establish a school support service model for students with disabilities in regular classroom by using the data retrieved from the SNELS, in addition to probing into school support services for students with disabilities currently in regular classroom."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Research Model", "text": "On the basis of relevant literature, a theoretical model of school support services for students with disabilities in regular classroom is established in this study. As seen in Figure 1 , the latent independent variables of this model are \"teacher expertise\" and \"human resources\". \"Teacher expertise\" is represented by the two observed variables of participation in special education workshops and the benefits of these workshops. \"Human resources\" is represented by the four observed variables of extra human resources, help from itinerant teachers, cooperation with special education teachers, and the assistance of relevant professionals. The latent dependent variables include \"Teaching adjustment\" and \"School support services\". \"Teaching adjustment\" is constituted by the two observed variables of the means and adequacy of teaching adjustments. \"School support services\" are represented by the four observed variables of assistance from the school, support services for students, support services for parents, and the adequacy of the services. This model hypothesizes that the two latent independent variables of teacher expertise and human resources can directly influence on the provision of teaching adjustments and school support services, while indirectly influence on the latter via the mediators.

In terms of human resources, the most prevalent category is itinerant teachers, followed by speech and language therapists and parents. At the stage of primary school, the most prevalent categories are itinerant teachers and school-based special education teachers. In junior high schools, the most prevalent categories are school-based special education teachers, counselors, and parents. Since resource room and special education classes are already part of the school settings of primary and junior high schools in Taiwan, the support provided by school-based special education teachers is actually greater than that provided by itinerant teachers. However, parents are important human resources support in all the three stages of education.\nIn terms of adjustments in teaching, classroom environments, teaching strategies, and the contents or time allowed for the completion of homework are the most frequently used methods in different stages of education. However, rarely are efforts made to design curriculums or teaching materials and tools that fit the needs of students with disabilities. Although O'Rourke and Houghton (2008) found that adjustments in curriculum, homework, and support from teachers were effective in helping students with mild disabilities to SCHOOL SUPPORT SERVICES MODEL FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES 1076 enhance their learning outcomes, Carlson, Bitterman, and Daley (2010) showed that as many as 44% of preschool teachers were not making any changes or adjustments to their curriculum for children with special needs. Dowrick, Anderson, Heyer, and Acosta (2005) also indicated that regular classroom teachers had low intentions to adjust their curriculum or teaching materials in response to the needs of students with disabilities.\nIn terms of school support services for students with disabilities, the most prevalent services provided in preschools are itinerant services, tuition refunds, speech and language therapy, and occupational therapy. In primary schools, the more common support services are tuition refunds, itinerant services, adjustments in examinations and assessment, and stipends and scholarships. In junior high schools, tuition refunds, stipends and scholarships, psychological counseling, and itinerant services are more often seen. As resource rooms are not available in preschools, they tend to attach more importance to early intervention, itinerant services, speech and language therapy, and occupational therapy, which account for the highest proportion of all their support services. In primary and junior high schools, itinerant services are provided at a lower frequency, while support services, such as tuition refunds, stipends and scholarships, psychological counseling, and adjustments in examinations and assessment account for the higher proportion. These results support Tagayuna et al. (2005) , who found that the more frequently provided school support services were adjustments in examinations, individual counseling, etc. However, these research findings differ from that reported by NLTS2, who highlighted that the most prevalent support services for secondary school students with disabilities were speech and language therapy, occupational therapy or vocational rehabilitation, transcription, and mobility services (U.S. Department of Education, 2004)."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "In summation, this study establishes a school support service model for students with disabilities in preschools, primary, and junior high schools. In this study, though the path coefficients of the school support service models at the three different stages are different, they all reached a significance level of 0.01. In addition, the support services show a satisfactory explanation of the variation of the overall model, peaking in the case of the school support service model for junior high school at 85%. Moreover, this study found that, while itinerant teachers constitute an important human resource for preschools; in primary and junior high school-based special education teachers and parents play this role. Regular classroom teachers rely most frequently on adjustments to classroom environments, teaching strategies, and the content or time allowed for the completion of homework. The most prevalent services provided in preschools are itinerant services, tuition refunds, speech and language therapy, and occupational therapy. In primary and junior high schools, stipends and scholarships, psychological counseling, and adjustments in examinations and means of assessment are more often used.\nThe results of this study show that regular classroom teachers in primary and junior high school tend to spend less time on special education workshops, which might create a difference in their professional competencies when teaching students with disabilities, as well as their use of teaching adjustments. It is therefore suggested that education authorities should adopt regular classroom teachers taking a more active part in special education workshops, in order to better teach students with disabilities."}]
