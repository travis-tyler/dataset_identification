[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder characterized by neuropathologic changes involving beta-amyloid (A\u03b2), tau, neuronal loss, and other associated biological events. While levels of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A\u03b2 and tau peptides have enhanced the antemortem detection of AD-specific changes, these two markers poorly reflect the severity of cognitive and functional deficits in people with altered A\u03b2 and tau levels. While multiple previous studies identified non-A\u03b2, non-tau proteins as candidate neurodegenerative markers to inform the A/T/N biomarker scheme of AD, few have advanced beyond association with clinical AD diagnosis. Here we analyzed nine promising neurodegenerative markers in a three-centered cohort using independent assays to identify candidates most likely to complement A\u03b2 and tau in the A/T/N framework. Methods: CSF samples from 125 subjects recruited at the three centers were exchanged such that each of the nine previously identified biomarkers can be measured at one of the three centers. Subjects were classified according to cognitive status and CSF AD biomarker profiles as having normal cognition and normal CSF (n = 31), normal cognition and CSF consistent with AD (n = 13), mild cognitive impairment and normal CSF (n = 13), mild cognitive impairment with CSF consistent with AD (n = 23), AD dementia (n = 32; CSF consistent with AD), and other non-AD dementia (n = 13; CSF not consistent with AD). Results: Three biomarkers were identified to differ among the AD stages, including neurofilament light chain (NfL; p < 0.001), fatty acid binding protein 3 (Fabp3; p < 0.001), and interleukin (IL)-10 (p = 0.033). Increased NfL levels were most strongly associated with the dementia stage of AD, but increased Fabp3 levels were more sensitive to milder AD stages and correlated with both CSF tau markers. IL-10 levels did not correlate with tau biomarkers, but were associated with rates of longitudinal cognitive decline in mild cognitive impairment due to AD (p = 0.006). Prefreezing centrifugation did not influence measured CSF biomarker levels. Conclusion: CSF proteins associated with AD clinical stages and progression can complement A\u03b2 and tau markers to inform neurodegeneration. A validated panel inclusive of multiple biomarker features (etiology, stage, progression) can improve AD phenotyping along the A/T/N framework."}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": "The clinicopathologic description of Alzheimer's disease (AD) underwent recent revisions to better characterize, on parallel continuums, the cognitive and neuropathologic features associated with beta-amyloid (A\u03b2) deposition, tau hyperphosphorylation, and neurodegeneration [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . This A/T/N framework has the advantage of providing a multidimensional view of AD, although accurate antemortem detection of all three features remains an obstacle in early diagnosis and clinical trial design. AD biomarkers, including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) [6] or positron emission tomography (PET) [7, 8] measures of amyloid and tau proteins, correlate well with postmortem amyloid and tau (A/T) pathology, but their levels have not been shown to accurately track disease progression [9, 10] to provide information on neurodegeneration. We and others have previously identified CSF proteins which accompany altered amyloid and tau biomarkers in large discovery cohorts, and these non-A\u03b2, non-tau (NANT) markers are candidate markers of neurodegeneration [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . However, successful replication of these markers' association with AD has been challenging. This may be due to many issues, including recruitment bias [18] , processing artifacts when assays are performed by commercial vendors [19] , and different antibodies, and few of them have been replicated across cohorts and assay platforms to undergo further standardization and application.\nCSF is a ready source for simultaneously testing multiple markers reflecting AD core pathology, copathology (ischemia, Lewy bodies), neurodegeneration, common biological alterations (e.g., neuroinflammation), and unique exposures (e.g., environmental toxins) [20] . We previously sought to identify NANT biomarkers through single-center studies [12, 14, 19] , and subsequently determined that some replication failures resulted from biases in recruitment, diagnosis, preanalytical handling, and analytical algorithms [18] .

Here we used multicentered samples and independent assays to confirm CSF Fabp3 and NfL as stage-dependent biomarkers in AD. The levels of these two markers also correlated with t-Tau (both) and p-Tau 181 (Fabp3) in the CSF, and can be prospectively tested as surrogate markers of response in future clinical trials targeting tau. Furthermore, we found a complex relationship between CSF IL-10 levels, AD, and cognition, but associated lower CSF IL-10 levels to faster cognitive decline in MCI. Altogether, these findings point to a set of unique biochemical events associated with cumulative and on-going cognitive decline in AD, and add a suite of NANT biomarkers to the A/T/N scheme.\nPrevious work-including our own-has primarily focused on NANT biomarkers whose levels differed between NC -and AD dementia. Subjects with normal cognition but abnormal AD biomarkers (CSF or PET) were variably included with or excluded from those whose cognition and AD biomarkers were both normal, and the distinction between MCI + and AD dementia could be based on the number of impaired neuropsychological domains, functional independence, or consensus. Aside from these study design biases, our current study showed that analyzing only the two extreme groups overlooked at least one biologically meaningful marker, IL-10. At the same time, levels of the most commonly cited candidate staging marker-NfL, a neuronal cytoskeletal protein associated with axonal injury-were most elevated in the dementia stage of AD, but did not sufficiently distinguish between the earlier stages (NC infiltrating macrophages) was consistent with previously reported ranges [11] .\nFabp3 levels better distinguished between different AD stages than NfL and YKL-40 [11] , and may serve as a good neurodegenerative biomarker since its levels correlated well with CSF t-Tau and p-Tau 181 levels. Fabp3 is a small soluble protein expressed in neurons, astrocytes, and brain endothelial cells [25] [26] [27] . It is involved in the intracellular transport of polyunsaturated fatty acid [28] as well as modulation of acetylcholine and glutamate release [29] . Brains with AD and schizophrenia were found to have reduced Fabp3 levels [30, 31] , and serum Fabp3 levels are elevated in multiple dementia and brain injury syndromes [32] [33] [34] . Data from the ADNI and other studies have shown that CSF Fabp3 levels do not differ between NC -and NC + [35, 36] , but do increase in the symptomatic AD stages [36, 37] and with progressive entorhinal atrophy [38] . Consistent with these prior findings, we also found similar Fabp3 levels in MCI + and AD dementia. Thus, whereas increased NfL levels may reflect sufficient neurodegeneration to result in functional decline [39] , Fabp3 may be a more sensitive marker to predementia neurodegeneration.\nWe found IL-10 levels to differ between clinical AD stages but not between NC -and AD dementia. This came as counter-intuitive for us, which led to further experiments related to IL-10. CSF IL-10 levels were variably linked with AD in previous discovery-based studies [12, 14] . Among potential explanations for these discrepant findings, we eliminated analytical and preanalytical variabilities as confounds in our study since IL-10 levels were all measured at a single site and did not differ in a prospective follow-up study targeting the effects of pre-freezing centrifugation. At the same time, selection bias in banked biospecimens may account for reduced IL-10 levels in MCI + compared with AD as lower IL-10 levels were associated with greater rates of memory decline, a feature often considered when MCI samples are selected retrospectively. This is supported by our follow-up study where MCI subjects with the lowest CSF IL-10 levels tended to experience greater memory decline. At the same time, there exist potential biological explanations for lower IL-10 levels in NC + and MCI + . IL-10 has often been considered an anti-inflammatory cytokine, but it is released by proinflammatory, anti-inflammatory, and regulatory T helper cells. Its release and effects are thus complex, and IL-10 does not exist or act in isolation. Lower IL-10 levels in NC + may be interpreted as a failure in anti-inflammatory processes associated with onset of pathologic AD, or alternatively balanced anti-and proinflammatory responses in asymptomatic AD (e.g., we previously showed complement activation to accompany the MCI + to AD transition [18] ). Similarly, higher IL-10 levels in AD than NC + and MCI + may represent exaggerated anti-inflammatory responses or appropriate IL-10 response to AD-related neuroinflammation. These challenges call for the simultaneous measurements of cytokines representing different pro-and anti-inflammatory pathways in future studies, as well as immunophenotyping analysis in the CSF. This approach will also better explain why reduced IL-10 levels may predict faster rates of decline in MCI. Instead of measuring promising AD biomarkers only at a single site (academic or commercial), we show here that a collaborative model of replication moves the most promising NANT biomarkers towards further development. It enables a greater number of candidate markers to undergo simultaneous validation in subjects recruited from each center in a head-to-head design, identifies analytes with inter-site variabilities, and permits follow-up experiments to empirically determine the effects of different preanalytical procedures. At the same time, our study is limited by the sample size, as yet unidentified factors to account for center-to-center variations, genetic background of populations at the three geographically separate sites, and imperfect matching of some diagnostic categories among centers (NC + , OD). We did not include CSF biomarkers for non-beta-amyloid/tau neurodegenerative processes (e.g., a-synuclein, phosphorylated TDP-43 levels) as they are less mature, and accounting for them may help explain variability across centers and AD stages. We also did not analyze the NANT biomarker levels in a large group of OD since cases with high confidence pathology (through autopsy confirmation or, less preferably, mutation because of the mutations' potential direct impact on inflammation) are limited in number. Translation of promising markers validated here into the A/T/N biomarker suite will need to prospectively determine the impact of biological, preanalytical, and analytical variabilities on the levels and stability of these markers, and the A/T/N scheme itself may need future revision to account for copathology and other contributors."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "In summary, we successfully confirmed three proteins (Fabp3, NfL, and IL-10) as potentially informative biomarkers to complement established AD biomarkers (A\u03b2 and tau) through a three-centered, North American, non-ADNI study. Importantly, we used assays easily accessible to investigators who can further optimize their development and translation. "}]
