Field surveys of the federally endangered razorback sucker were conducted in FY06 on the Colorado River from Davis Dame to Lake Havasu and on Lake Mohave. Using a combination of boat surveys and high-resolution digital aerial pho tography, researchers tested the efficiency and effectiveness of these survey methods for find ing and counting these unique fish. Boat sur veys, which involve surface counts and elec trofishing, appear to be a cost-effective alter native to traditional trammel-net fish sam pling, which has the significant drawback of sometimes catching water birds and mammals in addition to fish. Evaluation of aerial sur veys, flown in winter when the reservoir is clear and shallow, will continue into FY08. In a related task, researchers conducted studies to determine whether physical conditioning and predator recognition behavior could be en hanced in hatcheries and thereby improve short-term stocking survival rates. Razorback suckers were subjected to water velocities of 30 cm/s for 10 weeks and given predator survival tests. Results showed that survival of velocity-conditioned fish exposed to predators was 22 percent greater than in non-conditioned fish. This work demonstrated that predator avoidance by razorback suckers was a learned behavior, and that physical conditioning improved survival."}, {"section_title": "Lake Havasu Fishery Management Memorandum of Understanding (MOU).", "text": "An MOU was signed in FY06 to implement the multi-agency Lake Havasu Fishery Enhancement Program, established to optimize habitat conditions for improved recreational fishing. The USGS is a signa tory along with the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Arizona Department of Game and Fish, and California Fish and Game Depart ment. The group's purpose is to oversee and make recommendations on the program, which in cluded one-time stocking of 30,000 bonytail and 30,000 razorback suckers. Both are endangered species native to the Colorado River. A FORT scientist is the primary scientific contact for this work and is monitoring these native fish populations using the survey methods described above.\nDecision Support System (DSS) for the Upper Delaware River. FORT scientists deliv ered to the Delaware River Basin Commission Version 2.0 of a DSS prototype for predicting the effects of different water management strategies on habitat for fish and mussels in the upper Dela ware River Basin. As input to the DSS, investigators used two-dimensional models of habitat for trout, American shad, and dwarf wedgemussels at 11 sites in the East and West Branches, the mainstem Delaware, and the Neversink River, and at 15 different discharges in each river. This in put enables the DSS to quantify and display changes for a variety of decision variables that result from changes in reservoir operations and water supplies. Several modifications were made in re sponse to stakeholder comments and perceived needs. The final report, with Version 2.1 documen tation, is in preparation.\nDecision Support System Template for the Yakima River. FORT scientists provided to U.S. Bureau of Reclamation staff a prototype DSS template for their review and suggested revi sions. The DSS will support water management decisions by quantifying changes in salmonid habi tat in the Yakima River, Wash., resulting from changes in water supply (by transbasin diversion from the Columbia River) and reservoir operations. Placeholders have been reserved in the DSS template for model outputs as they become available from cooperators. Investigators conducted a Delphi exercise to define the habitat characteristics to be used in developing habitat maps for each of the target species and life stages. Habitat-versus-discharge maps have been completed for vari ous life stages of salmon and steelhead for one of five floodplain reaches in the Yakima.

Tamarisk, or salt cedar, is an exotic plant species that has in vaded riparian areas throughout the West. Multi-agency efforts toward controlling and removing tamarisk are ongoing and more are proposed. FORT scientists are working on several levels to as sist Federal and State land and water management agencies by providing sound science for effec tive decision-making. Projects include leading research coordination and information exchange among the many involved agencies, tribes, and private groups; developing predictive models to estimate vegeta tion changes and their effects on water supply in response to different flow regimes; and researching tamarisk ecol ogy and the effectiveness of different management, control, and removal processes.

Predicting which species will invade and which habitats will be invaded requires collecting field data at the appropriate spatial scales. In this study of 36 vegetation types across the central United States, the FORT research team with the USGS National Institute of Invasive Species Science (NIISS) discov ered through FY06 data analysis that typical 1-m 2 plots greatly underestimated invasion potential, and that multi-scale and larger-scale plots are needed to accurately predict vulnerability to invasion. The proposed field and analysis methods can be applied on all DOI lands. They are featured in a new book by FORT/NIISS investigator Tom Stohlgren (Measuring Plant Diversity, 2006, Oxford University Press), and in recent journal articles.\nNew System for Sensitive Data Sharing on Invasive Species. Data sharing is a critical component for knowledge of non-native, invasive species distributions to create watch lists, predic tive models, and an early warning rapid-response system. Invasive species do not recognize politi cal boundaries, making it necessary for resource managers in different agencies to know what spe cies are found in their vicinity. Data can be sensitive for many reasons, precluding data sharing, especially if the data are from private lands or include the location of a novel biological control agent. FORT staff have developed a system available on the NIISS Web site (www.niiss.org) that synthesizes disparate datasets shared by different users, including a mechanism to mark locations as sensitive. Sensitive data are \"fuzzed\" to all but the contributor for the mapping application and data download, but can still be used for analyses. This technique to overcome the problems of data sen sitivity is featured in an upcoming article in Biological Invasions.\nCreating a Volunteer Network for Weed Data Collection on Refuges. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service needs statistically sound, cost-efficient surveys of invasive plants and animals on over 500 National Wildlife Refuges. In cooperation with the FWS, FORT's research team at the National Institute of Invasive Species Science developed and tested a volunteer network to map in vasive species. Researchers developed sampling protocols, trained refuge staff, and advised volun teers from the local community on gathering extensive field data on high-priority weeds in the Hart Mountain national Antelope Refuge in Oregon. They also gathered plot data to create maps and models of key invaders and to guide further surveys. The team created a generalized protocol, called \"The Art and Science of Weed Mapping,\" that will be published after expanding and testing the system at three additional refuges across the country in 2007. Creating networks of trained vol unteers for invasive species surveys is the first step in creating a cost-efficient early detection and rapid response program in the National Wildlife Refuge System."}, {"section_title": "Coal Bed Methane (CBM) Development Effects on the Establishment on Non-native", "text": "Plants.

Working closely with U.S. Bureau of Land Manage ment officials, FORT investigators evaluated the vegetation and soil characteristics of well pads, water release areas, and \"undisturbed/control\" sites in the Powder River Basin, Wyo. They found increased invasion on CBM-developed areas, reduced native plant diversity on pads, and extensive invasion in water release areas. However, control sites were also invaded to some degree. This pilot study suggested the need for a more extensive regional evaluation of cumulative effects of CBM development and associated infrastructure (roads and fences) relative to background conditions."}, {"section_title": "Filling in Data Gaps for Native and Non-native Species Using Modeling Techniques.", "text": "Knowledge of species richness patterns for both native and non-native species is an important com ponent of setting conservation priorities. Many large-scale datasets exist, but these datasets often suffer from incomplete sampling. In this study using county-level species lists, our research team at the NIISS took spatially incomplete datasets and used the best sampled areas to develop models that could predict the richness of native and non-native species in poorly sampled areas. A key finding was that native species richness was the best predictor of non-native species richness. These methods, featured in a recent article in Diversity and Distributions, can be applied at different spa tial scales and for different taxonomic groups important to Federal land management.\nModeling Capture Probability of the Invasive Brown Treesnake. The brown treesnake is a highly destructive, non-native species introduced on Guam in the 1940s that has extirpated most of the island's native bird species, as well as bats and lizards. Trapping is one of the main techniques currently used to detect and control brown treesnake populations. Heterogeneity (vari ability) in trap-capture probabilities poses a serious challenge for control efforts, particularly con trol programs directed at eradicating an incipient or nearly extirpated population. In order to facili tate the development and refinement of detection and control technologies, project biologists identified and quantified the factors that affect capture probability of brown treesnakes. FORT scientists are using these fac tors to model capture probabilities as a function of in dividual covariates (size, sex, condition, prior capture history, etc.) and latent (unexplained) heterogeneity. Improvement in our understanding of the causes of heterogeneity will not only refine our ability to strate gically plan eradications, but also will greatly improve the precision of abundance estimates."}, {"section_title": "Documenting Introductions and Pathways of Invasion of New Exotic Prey Species on Guam.", "text": "Shipping and air traffic out of Guam provides opportunities for the destructive, invasive brown treesnake (BTS) to be transported to other islands and beyond. Lizard and amphibian species are the primary prey of small BTS on Guam. Small size classes of BTS are least likely to be inter cepted by current trapping interdiction efforts and are also the size class most often detected in cargo. Thus, keeping the prey base for small snakes as low as possible in order not to increase ju venile survival seems desirable in preventing accidental snake transport to Hawaii and other Pacific islands. This study documented new exotic frog species introductions to Guam and provided an overview of the various pathways by which they entered the island. The identification of major pathways allows for strategic targeting of prevention efforts. Targeting pathways rather than indi vidual species is a more productive approach to invasive species control, because each pathway can be a vector for a suite of organisms."}, {"section_title": "Status and Trends of Biological Resources", "text": "Status and trends research identifies ongoing or impending changes to species, habitats, and ecosystems.

Long-billed Curlews are a species of special concern in North America due to apparent declines in their population. Because Long-billed Curlews are not adequately monitored by existing programs (for example, the North American Breeding Bird Survey), at the request of U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service FORT undertook a two-year study with the goals of (1) determining present Long-billed Curlew distribution and breeding population size in the United States, and (2) Results showed that Long-billed Curlews were patchily distributed within their range and were present and presumably breeding in areas with rela tively little native grassland. The study report makes recommendations for improving sampling methodology and presents power curves to provide guidance on minimum sample sizes required to detect trends in abundance.\nIntegrating Agriculture and Conservation. Assistance to the USDA Farm Service Agency (FSA) focused on refinement of management of lands enrolled in the CRP and other conservation programs administered by the USDA. In cooperation with the Kansas De partment of Wildlife and Parks, field data col lection was completed on a two-year study to determine effects of incidental cattle grazing on linear conservation practices associated with winter grazing of crop stubble fields. Results of this investigation have the potential to show that conservation policies and viable economic uses are complementary uses of agricultural lands. FORT scientists completed an investiga tion of the Farmable Wetlands Program and delivered a final report and presentation of management implications for these lands to FSA headquarters staff. In cooperation with the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service, Colorado State University, and a private landowner, FORT scientists continued an investigation of grazing to refine management of CRP grassland in the shortgrass steppe. This long-term study has the potential to refine agricultural conservation policies and make them more beneficial to both ag ricultural operations and wildlife endemic to shortgrass ecosystems. In addition, FORT staff pro vided assistance to the Wildlife Management Institute and FSA pertaining to a National Corn Grower Association request for documentation of conservation program effectiveness in the Little Blue River watershed of Kansas and Nebraska. Key findings of this investigation highlighted the interest of landowners for continued participation in conservation programs, their desire for infor mation describing local results, communication of this information to the general public, and the need for local assessments of the effectiveness of conservation policies.\nPublic Knowledge and Perception of Bats. Bats are reservoirs for viruses that can poten tially impact the health of humans and other mammals. Along Colorado's Front Range, bats are finding new roosts in homes and buildings (commensalism) as urbanization diminishes the avail ability of natural roosts. This puts bats and people in greater likelihood of contact and thus at in creased risk for disease transmission. This collaborative study involves scientists from FORT, Colorado State University, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The objective is to expand the very limited knowledge base on public knowledge, perceptions, and preferences concerning bats and disease transmission by investigating the human dimensions impacts of com mensal bats and humans. Such information is vital for managing bats and developing effective communica tions protocols regarding bat disease and ecology. In FY06, FORT investigators analyzed data and presented findings at The Wildlife Society's annual meeting. They also developed a draft report of survey results to share with partners and interested survey respondents. Papers for submission to peer-reviewed journals are underway."}, {"section_title": "Assessing the Use of Geospatial Data in Response and Recovery Efforts for Hurricanes", "text": "Katrina and Rita.

Research Supporting the Comprehensive Conservation Planning Process for National Wildlife Refuges. The Comprehensive Conservation Plan (CCP) for each National Wild life Refuge must contain an analysis of local social and economic conditions and evaluate social and economic results from likely management scenarios. FORT researchers continue to provide assistance with CCP development for refuges in the Pacific, Southwest, Northeast, and MountainPrairie Regions. Research involves social analyses of public attitudes related to specific refuges and their management; regional economic impact analyses of current and proposed management activi ties; nonmarket valuation of refuge visitor benefits; and stakeholder assessments to identify and classify (1) the primary policies, regulations, and stakeholders affecting the refuge's CCP and (2) To help the refuge in its planning process related to CCP development and in particular the so cial science questions, FORT staff conducted an assessment of both identified stakeholders and the planning team. Stakeholders were evaluated in terms of their preference for process (nego tiation or arbitration) and their preference for outcome (status quo or change) in identifying and addressing planning issues. They found that stakeholders perceived negotiation as the most likely process, and that parties were very mixed in their views of whether the status quo was an acceptable outcome. They also found that the planning team was not unified in their view on these questions. These results, which were shared with the planning team, are important be cause successful negotiation teams must share a common understanding of the structure and goals of a problem in order to speak with one voice and reach agreement."}, {"section_title": "Terrestrial Ecosystems", "text": "Ecosystem investigations aim to quantify and understand factors that influence variation in key ecosystem components over time and space.

Together the agencies will develop a nitrogen deposition goal and related standards assisted by Dr. Baron's paper, \"Hindcasting nitrogen deposition to determine an ecological critical load,\" which appeared in the April 2006 issue of Ecological Applications.\nResults of Bighorn Sheep Studies. Like many popula tions of bighorn sheep in the West, bighorn sheep in the greater Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area (BICA) of Montana and Wyoming were extirpated in the late 1800s. A small herd was reintroduced to the area in 1973 and increased to about 211 animals. Then, for un known reasons, the population declined sharply in the mid-1990s. The numbers leveled off at around 100 ani mals by 1998. In 2000, at the request of National Park Service resource managers, FORT researchers began a study to evaluate (1) the causes for this decline, (2) herd population dynamics, and (3) Recovery after Wildfire. By October 2006, wildfires throughout the West had consumed more than 9.1 million acres of wildland, the highest as of this date in 10 years, and new fires were developing daily. Families living in communities hit by such fires face years of coping with the aftermath. FORT staff and a handful of local partners developed a community-based approach, the Volunteer Task Force, that engaged Los Alamos, N.M., citizens and schools in post-fire reha bilitation and environmental education. Task Force efforts-including coordination of more than 70,000 volunteer hours since the summer of 2000, when the Cerro Grande fire burned some 43,000 acres-are catalyzing the recovery of the ecosystem, and they continue to help the residents recover as well. The techniques applied in Los Alamos also have assisted other fire-affected communities in the Southwest. In addition, FORT scientist John Hogan has led countless educational/field-work trips with local students who collect data and help with restoration activities in a burned watershed as part of learning about fire and forest ecology in their community. As an outgrowth of this work, Mr. Hogan was a primary coauthor responsible for developing Investigating Fire Ecology in Pon derosa Pine Forests: A Curriculum for Sixth Grade.

Accurate herd counts lie at the heart of management decisions concerning herd and habitat health. FORT re searchers are working with the BLM and Colorado State University to test aerial survey techniques for more accurate population estimates, and they are also conducting field trials on immunocontracep tion in horse herds. In 2006, FORT scientists com pleted the final applications of fertility control to mares in two Herd Management Areas, and pro vided managers with pregnancy test results from treated mares in all three research herds. The fertil ity control applications conducted by FORT in the Little Book Cliffs (Colorado) has decreased the foaling rate by 43 percent in the last three years, thus reducing the physical and financial burdens associated with capture and removal strategies for population reduction. Behavioral and demographic data collected during FY06 provided real-time adaptive management information for BLM wild horse specialists and for analysis of key research questions. Tests of aerial population estimation techniques continued in FY06; FORT coordinated with BLM herd managers to conduct joint sur veys on all flights. Models for analyzing the aerial survey data were refined in FY06 and applied to all recent survey results to further improve estimation techniques.\nEndangered Bat Conservation. Three species of nectar-and pollen-feeding bats are criti cal to the health and maintenance of ecosystems in the borderland area. The lesser long-nosed bat and greater long-nosed bat are endangered, and the Mexican long-tongued bat is a candidate for listing. All three species are jeopardized by vandalism and destruction of roosting sites, killing by humans, and loss of habitat and food resources. FORT scientists recently completed a study of the distribution, abundance, and roosting behavior of the bats in southwestern New Mexico to inform U.S. Bureau of Land Management conservation and management activities affecting the bats and their associated desert ecosystems. Of substantial interest is the discovery of a natural cave roost on BLM lands in the Big Hatchett Mountains, which houses the largest known colony in the United States comprising both lesser and greater long-nosed bats. Over 5,000 bats were counted exiting from one of the two known entrances to this new roost. Another new roost was discovered in the Animas Mountains as well. The roost in the Big Hatchet Mountains is over 30 km to the east of the Animas roost and falls outside the known range of both species. The discovery of these additional roosts suggest that adequate roosting habitat for the two species in the region may be more common than previously suggested, and that both species of long-nosed bat have more extensive ranges in southwestern New Mexico than previously believed."}, {"section_title": "Ecology of Rabies Transmission in Commensal Bat", "text": "Colonies. FORT bat biologists have completed field and laboratory phases of a collaborative venture with Colorado State Uni versity and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta on the ecology of rabies transmission in big brown bats. This work was supported by the National Science Foundation and the National Institute of Health's Ecology of Infectious Diseases program, of which the USGS was a founding partner. FORT biologists concentrated on determining the population dynamics and ecology of bats that roost in human-occupied buildings in Fort Collins, Colo. They also coordinated field sampling of marked and released bats for serological studies of antibodies and determination of rabies virus in bat saliva. The 5-year study spanned disciplines ranging from molecular studies of genetic variants of the virus to seasonal migrations of the bats and integrated modeling to character ize the overall rabies transmission dynamics. This study has revealed a unique capacity of bats to acquire a degree of immunity to this virus, heretofore typically considered fatal in mammals. The unique application of passive integrated transponders for individual identification and remote moni toring of bats formed the foundation for determining bat survival rates (a key component of host dynamics) in relation to multiple ecological factors. The work is now concentrating on final data analysis and comprehensive modeling of the bat population-rabies transmission system. Bat Use of Coniferous Forests at Mesa Verde National Park. In FY06, FORT biologists initiated a new study of bats at Mesa Verde National Park as part of the Natural Resource Preserva tion Program. Nearly 1,000 bats were captured, identified, and released as they drank or foraged over water during this first summer of study. New distribution records for two species of bats were established for this park, and 2006 capture records documented 15 species of bats that use Mesa Verde. Selected individuals of multiple species were radio-tracked to determine roosting locations of reproductively active females. Most of these bats favored roosting in rock crevices, particularly in steep canyon cliff faces. For these bats, the recent extensive wildfires in pi\u00f1on-juniper wood lands may not have severely impacted roosting habitat.

The black-footed ferret was formally recognized on the very first endangered species list and has had a his tory of devastating losses and remarkable successes ever since. Incrementally through time, re searchers and managers have progressed in understanding the issues complicating ferret recovery and how to manage or overcome these challenges. In anticipation of the upcoming need to evaluate the status of ferrets and update the Recovery Plan, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service requested FORT's assistance in jointly hosting a symposium to evaluate the progress of blackfooted ferret recovery and identify next steps to advance ferret recovery. The 2004 symposium provided a forum for dissemi nating existing information and bringing together technical experts and resource managers to collaboratively discuss nec essary future actions. Much of the information presented at this forum-on ferret behavior, physiology, management re quirements, available habitat, and factors affecting survival and recovery-had not been readily available for use in recov ery planning. In FY06 FORT staff produced the symposium proceedings, Recovery of the Black-footed Ferret: Progress and Continuing Challenges.

A pilot study was completed showing that DNA can successfully be ex tracted from single Indiana bat fecal pellets collected from beneath roost trees. Additionally, re searchers isolated and developed primers for a suite of highly polymorphic microsatellite loci that can be used to gather a variety of data regarding Indiana bats, including information about demo graphics (population size, survival rates, and individual movements), social structure (relatedness of individuals in roost trees), and population structure.\nPopulation Genetics of Gunnison Sage-Grouse: Implications for Management. The newly described Gunnison Sage-Grouse is a species of concern for management because of marked declines in distribution and abundance. Loss and fragmentation of sagebrush habitat have also caused remaining populations to be unusually small and isolated, and therefore genetically at risk. In collaboration with the Colorado Division of Wildlife and scientists at the University of Denver, FORT recently completed a range-wide DNA analysis of Gunnison Sage-Grouse populations. These data were used to assess the extent of population subdivision among Gunnison Sage-Grouse populations and to document levels of genetic diversity. The study provided data for a range-wide conservation plan for this bird, including information pertaining to monitoring and maintaining ge netic diversity.\nShorebird Ecology on U.S. National Wildlife Refuges. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Ser vice conducts surveys of migratory birds, including shorebirds, at individual refuges in the National Wildlife Refuge system.

Southwest Wyoming possesses major en ergy resources as well as significant blocks of public land featuring world-class wildlife species and habitats. Accelerating energy and other human developments could have significant impact on these wildlife resources. To ensure full consideration and adaptive management of Wyoming's wildlife and habitats in the face of these increasing land-use pressures, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Wyoming Game and Fish Department, USDA Forest Service, and USGS are developing the Wyoming Landscape Conservation Initiative (WLCI). The WLCI is a long-term, science-based collaboration de signed to assess and enhance aquatic and terrestrial habitats at a landscape scale while facilitating responsible energy development. The initiative already has been rec ognized for partial funding under the Department of the Interior's FY 2008 American Landscape Initia tive for Healthy Lands, Communi ties, and Economies. In September 2006, FORT hosted a meeting of the partners (including FORT staff) to develop a strategy based on re search priorities and infrastructure needs. Because of its ample energy resources, prime wildlife habitat, and number of at-risk species, Southwest Wyoming serves as an ideal laboratory for developing new approaches to landscape conservation. As such, this region will be the initial focus of the WLCI. If successful, this concept could be applied to other ecosystems anywhere in the country.\nInstream Flow Listening Session. Scientific support for complex management decisions involving water use and impacts to aquatic systems requires a better understanding of critical instream flow and habitat needs. The USGS Central and Western Regions sponsored an instream flow listening session April 18-20 in Fort Collins, Colo., entitled \"Tools and Approaches for Decision-making and Resource Management.\" Federal natural resource agency managers and scientists discussed information needs as well as approaches for analyzing water requirements re lated to streamflow and habitat needs for instream aquatic communities. Workshop participants identified key resource management issues, new directions for advancing scientific understanding and support of these issues, and suggested directions for the USGS. Workshop results are provided in USGS Open-File Report 2006-1256.\nTravel Management on Public Lands Workshop. In order to make effective land man agement policies and decisions, public lands managers require information about recreational travel on public lands, including natural and cultural resource impacts, policy and regulation effects, visi tor needs and expectations, and techniques for collecting and applying scientific data to these is sues. Recreational travel includes trekking on foot (hiking and walking), animal-assisted travel (as with llamas or horses), and motorized off-highway vehicle travel (such as motorcycles, ATVs, or 4 wheel drive vehicles). Off-highway vehicle use on BLM lands alone increased 42 percent from 1999-2004. To help Federal land managers address this issue, FORT social scientist Phadrea Ponds and colleagues organized and hosted a workshop February 21-23, 2006, bringing together research and information about collaborative processes to help build the background for decisions concern ing travel management on Federal lands.

The Brown Treesnake (BTS), a destructive invasive species that became established on Guam in the 1940s, has extirpated many indigenous species and causes frequent power outages on the island. To help prevent incursions on other snake-free islands in the Pacific region, USGS estab lished the BTS Rapid Response Team (RRT). With local support and public assistance, the RRT can re spond quickly to snake sightings with teams of visual searchers, trained dogs, snake traps, and other tools to capture and remove BTS from snake-free locations. RRT membership and member refresher training is ongoing through yearly workshops. Currently there are more than 40 team members located throughout the Pacific region.

A metadata record is a file of information that captures the basic characteristics of a data or information resource, includ ing publications. Metadata documents, organizes, and maintains accessible information about re search projects, datasets, and scientific publications that help people who use these data locate the data they need (whether produced by themselves or others) and determine how best to use it. Be cause the generators of the data (e.g., scientists) move on over time, metadata also preserves the data history so that datasets can be re-used or adapted as needed. The Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) requires the application of metadata standards to all federally served metadata. The standards provide a common set of terminology and definitions for the documentation of data, including items such as title, geographic area covered, dates, data quality, spatial reference used, and contact information. FORT not only produces metadata for its own research and publications, but also serves as a national contact for quality control of metadata for the Web-based National Biological Information Infrastructure (NBII) Principal Node. All FORT metadata is available on the NBII Web site at http://nbii.gov.\nFORT Metadata. In FY06, FORT created and served approximately 202 new, nonpublication, project-overview metadata records and 25 new non-publication theme/dataset metadata records on the NBII Clearinghouse Principal Node. All existing publications metadata records were updated and new records created for a total of 2013 publication metadata records. Publications metadata were served in the NBII Clearinghouse Bibliographic Node. FORT developed a database tool that uses information extracted from the USGS project database to create a significant portion of the non-publication overview metadata. FORT specialists employ this same tool to begin devel opment of the detailed non-publication, theme/dataset metadata, which is then supplemented by information provided by the principal investigators. Metadata staff also refined and enhanced pre viously developed tools to more efficiently produce the publications metadata.\nNBII Metadata Quality Control. In support of the NBII, FORT in FY06 served as the na tional contact for quality control of metadata files submitted by numerous public and private data providers for serving on the NBII Clearinghouse Principal Node.

Developing a Regional Approach for Integrated Monitoring Related to Energy Explo ration and Development: Colorado Pilot Study. The U.S. Bureau of Land Management faces a difficult task in developing and implementing monitoring programs that are effective and efficient across different geographic and time scales. Further, such programs must be capable of satisfying multiple institutional and legal requirements associated with environmental compliance and landuse planning. To this end, FORT and BLM are developing a practical approach to integrated moni toring related to energy development that capitalizes on existing monitoring programs and readily available data and information. This effort is part of a national focus on monitoring by BLM and is one of three pilot studies being conducted, with the other two projects occurring in Wyoming and Alaska.\nEvaluating Species Models for the Ecoregional Analy sis of Sagebrush Ecosystems within the Wyoming Basin. Eco regional assessments are valuable predictive tools for addressing large-scale, range-wide factors likely to affect the well-being of species of concern, and they can guide the development of man agement plans to reduce further loss or degradation of included habitats. In this task, FORT scientists will (1) develop spatially explicit models for 5 additional sagebrush-dependent species oc curring across the Wyoming Basin Ecoregional Assessment Study Area, (2) conduct field surveys to sample the distribution of spe cies of concern in relation to habitat and disturbance, and (3) use field data to assess the accuracy of all 10 different species models, update the model parameters, identify regions of significant im pact by land use, and test the response of species to human distur bance.\nMapping Sagebrush Habitats in Human-Influenced Landscapes. The BLM, which manages approximately 50 percent of remaining sagebrush habitats, needs methodologies to accurately assess and monitor habitats at landscape scales to meet management objectives. Scientists involved with this task are developing statistically rigorous methods to map the distribution, cover, and height of sagebrush as well as identify the distribution of roads, trails, and oil and gas infrastructure. In part this work involves testing the relative effectiveness of differ ent remote sensing technologies in identifying and mapping various sagebrush species at larger scales using ground-truthed vegetation data. During the summer of 2006, researchers compiled all existing remotely sensed and digital data and acquired additional remotely sensed imagery at sites across the range of sagebrush habitat within Wyoming. They also began mapping anthropogenic features in southwestern Wyoming, using existing and newly acquired digital data.\nQuantifying the Physical Impacts of Reenacted Mormon Handcart Journeys across the Historic Oregon-California Trail. In 1843, a train of wagons and people began their journey to the new frontier, traveling from Missouri across parts of Wyoming along the only corri dor that provided access to Oregon, Idaho, Washington, California, and Nevada. Over the next 25 years, as many as half a million people made this historic journey along the Oregon-California Trail. The trail was still used into the early 1900s, although to a lesser extent. In1998, Mormon handcart companies be gan reenacting their ancestors' historic westward trips, re sulting in short-duration but intense use of certain sections of the trail. Because this trail is considered a historic relic, BLM managers are concerned about damage to the trail caused by the intense use of wagons, handcarts, and motor ized vehicles during these reenactments, as well as other off-highway vehicle use. FORT scientists are quantifying those impacts by (1) compiling all existing remotely sensed, digital, and air-photo data of the study area and (2) working with BLM field staff to compare the number, duration, and types of users along various segments of the trail in order to assess the impacts of each type of use and of combined uses.
