In 1990, ground water accounted for nearly 85 percent of the State's drinking water; in 1995, it accounted for almost 95 percent others, 1993, 1998) . Previous studies conducted in Idaho detected high concentrations of nitrate in many of the State's aquifers (Rupert, 1994; Crockett, 1995; Rupert and others, 1996) . Previous studies also detected increasing concentrations of nitrate in a growing number of public-and domestic-use wells Young and others, 1987a; Young and others, 1987b; Rupert, 1994; Clark and Ott, 1996; Rupert and others, 1996) . The predominant sources of nitrate throughout much of the State are inorganic fertilizer, cattle manure, and legume crops (Rupert, 1996) .\nThese increasing nitrate concentrations are of particular concern in the mid-Snake region of south-central Idaho. The region is experiencing substantial growth in some agricultural industries associated with the discharge of nitrogen to the environment, including dairies and other confined animal feeding operations. Gooding, Jerome, and Twin Falls Counties are experiencing particular growth in dairy operations (Idaho Agricultural Statistics Service, 1999; U.S. Department of Agriculture, 1999). These potential new sources of nitrogen to ground water are additional to those sources from existing, long-term agricultural activities in the region. Because of declining ground-water quality in parts of the mid-Snake region, the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality (IDEQ) designated those areas as priority water-quality management areas and targeted them for further study and assistance to improve land-use planning, nitrogen monitoring, and nitrogen management. At present (2006), planners and resource managers in the region lack analysis tools that could assist them in land-use planning and in managing and protecting water resources. When they attempt to evaluate how new and proposed changes to land use might affect their water resources, they must do so on an operation-by-operation basis without the ability to consider the cumulative effects from all nitrogen sources.\nIn response to these concerns and needs, the IDEQ proposed a project to study nitrogen loading effects and to develop planning tools to help assess how various land-use decisions might affect nitrate concentrations in the region's ground water. The IDEQ asked the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) to conduct an investigation in the mid-Snake region of south-central Idaho that comprises Jerome and Minidoka Counties and parts of Blaine, Bingham, Butte, Camas, Cassia, Elmore, Gooding, Lincoln, Power, and Twin Falls Counties ( fig. 1 ). \nLayered basalt flows in the eastern Snake River Plain aquifer yield exceptionally large volumes of water to wells and springs. Individual well yields are some of the highest in the Nation, typically ranging from 2,000 to 3,000 gal/min to as much as 7,000 gal/min with minimal drawdown (Whitehead, 1992; Lindholm, 1996) . Transmissivity is commonly 100,000 ft 2 /d and can be as high as 1,000,000 ft 2 /d (Whitehead, 1992) . Locally, aquifer properties can vary greatly; on a regional scale, however, the variability is minimal.\nRegional ground water in the eastern Snake River Plain aquifer moves from the northeast to the southwest (Rupert, 1997) . Ground water is discharged as springs and seeps to the Snake River along the reach bordering Twin Falls, Jerome, and Gooding Counties. Ground-water discharge to this reach of the Snake River increased considerably from about 1910 through the early 1950s (Kjelstrom, 1992) . The increase is attributed to recharge from surface-water irrigation north of the Snake River. Since the early 1950s, ground-water discharge to the Snake River has decreased as a result of (1) increased ground-water withdrawals for irrigation (Moreland, 1976) , (2) introduction of more efficient irrigation practices such as the conversion from flood to sprinkler irrigation, and (3) local droughts (Kjelstrom, 1992) ."}, {"section_title": "Purpose and Scope", "text": "The purpose of the study was to improve understanding of past and future effects of land-use-related nitrogen loading on ground water in the study area.

The simulator's graphical user interface (GUI) is enabled for use with geographic information systems (GIS). Objective 3 is addressed by this report, which documents the construction and calibration of the subregional flow and transport model, provides instructions for using the GIS-enabled GUI, and offers guidance for modeling the differences in nitrogen loading resulting from changes in land use.\nTo meet Objective 2, we developed a subregional model of the study area, based on a regional, three-dimensional ground-water flow model of the eastern Snake River Plain (ESRP model) that was developed and calibrated during the USGS Regional Aquifer System Analysis (RASA) program (Garabedian, 1992) .

The study area is in the downstream part of the eastern Snake River Plain. About 66 percent of the area is rangeland, 11 percent is flood-irrigated land, 21 percent is sprinkler-irrigated land, and the remaining 2 percent is comprised of several land-use types. The area is predominantly semiarid; mean annual precipitation ranges from 8 to 16 in. Therefore, most of the agricultural land in the study area lies near the Snake River, a major source of water for irrigation.\nThe ground-water system in the study area is made up of two types of aquifers: a regional basalt aquifer and a local perched alluvial aquifer. The regional basalt aquifer underlying the eastern Snake River Plain provides most of the ground water that moves through the study area. The local perched alluvial aquifer ( fig. 1 ) overlying the eastern Snake River Plain in Minidoka and Cassia Counties is a lesser source of ground water and is not included in the flow and transport modeling."}, {"section_title": "Snake River Plain Aquifer", "text": "The eastern Snake River Plain aquifer, which encompasses the study area, is composed primarily of vesicular and fractured olivine basalt flows (Quaternary age) of the Snake River Group (Whitehead, 1992) .

Water in this perched aquifer moves northward at the southern boundary of the perched aquifer and westward near the western boundary. The water level in the perched aquifer is about 100 ft above that of the Snake River Plain aquifer. The perched aquifer is recharged predominantly from the infiltration of irrigation water. Several wells completed in this aquifer go dry seasonally after irrigation ceases and become operational again after the start of the next irrigation season (Rupert 1997) ."}, {"section_title": "Development of the Snake River Nitrate Scenario Simulator", "text": "The water resources of the mid-Snake region have been studied in investigations of regional and local hydrologic systems of Idaho, including investigations of the Snake River Plain in southern Idaho that were part of the USGS RASA and National Water-Quality Assessment (NAWQA) programs. The RASA and NAWQA programs in southern Idaho have produced an assemblage of geologic, hydrologic, and waterquality information about the region's ground-water systems, as well as computer simulation of those systems. For the mid-Snake region study, we used this information, augmented with data collected in more recent and ongoing water-quality assessments of the area, to develop the Snake River Nitrate Scenario Simulator (SRNSS). Because similar information resources are available for much of the Snake River Plain, the investigation and tool-building approach developed in this study might be applicable to other priority water-quality management areas of the plain.\nSimulation results indicated that the nitrogen source layer was not necessarily the driving factor in the resulting nitrate concentration map; rather, the ground-water velocity appeared to be the prime controlling factor ( fig. 7 ). Some areas with large nitrogen loads and large ground-water velocities resulted in relatively small simulated nitrate concentrations, and other areas with relatively small nitrogen loads and small groundwater velocities had large simulated ground-water nitrate concentrations. The simulated results reasonably represent the measured data."}, {"section_title": "Eastern Snake River Plain Model", "text": "We based the configuration of the subregional model used in this study on a regional, three-dimensional ground-water flow model of the eastern Snake River Plain (ESRP model) that was developed and calibrated during the USGS RASA program (Garabedian, 1992) . We derived flow boundary conditions and initial estimates of aquifer properties for the new subregional model from the calibrated ESRP model. Because the ESRP model and its use influenced our modeling approach, it is important to note here some of the ESRP modeling techniques described by Garabedian (1992) that we used to develop the subregional model for this study.\nThe goal of the eastern Snake River Plain modeling was to reproduce known aquifer conditions (for example, head and spring discharge) within reasonable ranges of values, and to examine the hydrologic effects of changes in model input data through sensitivity testing. Initial values of aquifer hydraulic properties, recharge, discharge, and pumpage were estimated for model input based on geologic and hydrologic information. Model output was compared with known aquifer conditions to determine whether the initial estimates were reasonable. The model was tested to determine its sensitivity to changes in transmissivity, storage coefficient, aquifer leakance, recharge, riverbed or spring-outlet conductance, ground-water pumpage, and boundary flux. Input data were adjusted within reasonable ranges to achieve a better fit to known conditions. Adjustments were made to least-known and to most-sensitive model parameters. Simulation results indicated how the aquifer might have responded to past stresses, such as increased pumping and reduced recharge, and how the aquifer might respond to hypothetical stresses in the future.\nTo model the regional aquifer system, assumptions were made about aquifer properties, hydraulic fluxes, and initial conditions for transient analysis. The three-dimensional finite-difference ground-water-flow model MODFLOW-88 (McDonald and Harbaugh, 1988) was used most extensively. Vertical variations in head within each model layer were assumed to be negligible, and head losses between layers were assumed to be controlled by confining beds near the base of each layer. Therefore, model-simulated heads were an approximate average of heads within that aquifer layer.\nAccording to Garabedian (1992) , the regional aquifer system was subdivided vertically into four model layers. The layers were assigned equal thicknesses because differentiating the predominantly basalt aquifer system into distinct geohydrologic units was not possible. Layer 1 represents the upper 200 ft of the aquifer system; layer 2 is the next 300 ft below. Layers 1 and 2 contain Quaternary basalt of the Snake River Group and Tertiary basalt. Layers 3 and 4, are of lesser areal extent, and they are present only where basalt of the Snake River Group and interlayered sedimentary rocks are greater than 500-ft thick. Layer 3 is \u2264500 ft in thickness, and is present only across the central part of the plain. Layer 4 ranges in thickness from 0 to about 3,000 ft in the central part of the plain.\nLocal aquifers perched above the regional aquifer system were not simulated, although recharge to perched aquifers was assumed to reach the regional aquifer. Vertical hydraulic conductivity was assumed to be anisotropic, owing to low-hydraulic-conductivity basalt between permeable flow tops and fine-grained layers within sand and gravel zones. Horizontal hydraulic conductivity was assumed to be isotropic because two-dimensional simulations indicated small differences in modeling results between isotropic and anisotropic conditions.\nA steady-state model was constructed using 1980 wateryear fluxes (Garabedian, 1992, table 16 ). The 1980 fluxes were assumed to approximate the average annual flux for 1950-80. During that period, hydrologic conditions were stable relative to conditions from 1880 to 1950. Groundwater recharge was assumed to equal discharge (steady-state conditions) from 1950 to 1980 because irrigation diversions and ground-water levels were assumed to be stable relative to conditions from 1880 to 1950 (Garabedian, 1992, fig. 8 and pl. 4) . Declines in ground-water-level due to pumping, climatic variations, and decreased surface-water diversions during that period were generally small, and changes in storage were accordingly small (about 1 percent). These small changes in storage were included as a part of the recharge term by including them in the computation of approximate steady-state fluxes. Recharge from irrigation was assumed to take place directly below surface-water-irrigated areas.\nInitial conditions were approximated by the steady-state solution obtained after removing recharge due to surfacewater irrigation and discharge by ground-water pumping from the calibrated 1950-80 steady-state model. Surface-water altitudes, used in the model for river-leakage simulations, were corrected for pre-reservoir conditions. The estimated preirrigation steady-state condition was a stable initial condition for transient simulation. Therefore, simulated changes in head and discharge were assumed to result from changes in model input fluxes rather than from non-equilibrium initial conditions."}, {"section_title": "Subregional Model Development", "text": "To develop the subregional model used in this report, we converted the calibrated ESRP flow model from Modflow-88 to MODFLOW 2000 (Harbaugh and others, 2000) . Initial model runs were made on the calibrated regional model to calculate the quantity of ground-water flow across a newly-defined upgradient subregional model boundary. This boundary was set near the western boundary of Minidoka County at column 25 in the ESRP model (Garabedian, 1992) .\nWe then \"clipped\" the ESRP RASA model grid to this new upgradient boundary. The original ESRP model grid was divided into square cells approximately 4 mi per side. After the model area was reduced, the model area was rediscretized with each grid cell divided into approximately 1-mi square cells. Therefore, the number of grid cells increased by 16 times. A schematic drawing of this operation is illustrated in figure 2 .\nThe subregional model includes only the western portion of the ESRP model. Flow values across column 25 of the ESRP model were input as constant flow into the subregional model cells along the upgradient boundary. The flow was input into these cells as line wells. The model was run with this new configuration and resultant water levels and budget values were checked against the original model. Results were nearly identical to the original model.\nNo changes were made to the model configuration that affected ground-water elevations, discharge from springs, recharge sources, and other critical values or conditions. Also, we did not change the hydraulic parameters from the original ESRP model. The only change to the subregional flow model resulted from the use of a much smaller grid cell size than the one used in the ESRP model. The ESRP model incorporated the use of wells as recharge sources. Because of the smaller grid size used in the subregional model, we needed to increase the number of cells into which recharge was input in order to more accurately incorporate the recharge volume; otherwise, the model would not match the original results. Therefore, the total volume of recharge remained the same as in the ESRP model, but this volume was distributed over 16 times the number of recharge wells. Wherever possible, we placed these additional recharge wells in the rediscretized adjacent grid cell blocks. The volume of each original recharge well was evenly distributed between the 16 smaller cells. A few minor adjustments in the locations of these new recharge wells were needed so the new simulations matched the original simulations, especially along the model boundary.

MOC3D simulates three-dimensional solute transport in flowing ground water, computing changes in concentrations of a dissolved constituent over time that can be caused by factors such as advective transport, hydrodynamic dispersion, and mixing or dilution. MOC3D uses the method of characteristics to solve the transport equation for a given time step on the basis of hydraulic gradients computed with MODFLOW others, 1996, Kipp and others, 1998) . Particle tracking is used within the model to represent advective transport. The conceptual model of nitrogen input developed by Skinner and Donato (2003) was used in the transport model as a GIS, nitrogen-input data layer. This nitrogen source layer was used to define nitrogen flux at the surface in the flow and transport model. The flow and transport models were simulated using steady-state conditions in three dimensions.\nData collected or compiled during recent and ongoing studies that define ground-water nitrate concentrations were used to refine the new model and to evaluate model calibration. All concentrations of nitrate are presented consistently as milligrams per liter of nitrite plus nitrate as nitrogen with negligible nitrite concentrations in the area."}, {"section_title": "Nitrogen Source Layer", "text": "Data used for nitrogen input into the solute transport model were calculated as a nitrogen-input layer during a separate study, and described in Skinner and Donato (2003) . The input was updated to account for differences in study area extent between the two studies. This study's area includes additional areas of Bingham, Blaine, Butte, Camas, Elmore, and Power Counties; and less area of Cassia, Gooding, Lincoln, and Twin Falls Counties. The areas of the original nitrogen-input layer not in this study's area were simply \"clipped off.\" The expanded portions of this study area are primarily upgradient to the solute transport model, and represent background conditions for nitrogen input. We assigned nitrogen-input values to the expanded study area portions that corresponded to similar approaches in the adjacent counties ( fig. 3) .\nInput from the nitrogen source layer was incorporated in the MOC3D transport model by using the area wells function in all active model cells in layer 1. The area wells function allows for the nitrogen source layer load to be introduced into the flow model by assigning a volumetric stress to each cell. The stress applied is a small volume of water that contains a specified concentration of nitrogen derived from the source layer. The initial pre-agriculture background concentration applied throughout the model was 0.5 mg/L in the upper model layer, 0.4 mg/L in the second and third underlying layers, and 0.3 mg/L in the fourth underlying layer. A very small stress term was initially given, and this term was adjusted based on available nitrogen in ground-water data in the USGS National Water Information System (NWIS) database. These data were used to refine the new model and to evaluate its calibration. The calibration points included about 300 wells located throughout the model area, and 11 springs that discharge into the Snake River. The well data usually included one analysis per well. The data for most of the bedrock springs discharging from the aquifer included many analyses over numerous years (Clark and Ott, 1996) . The model continued to be simulated as steady state because the additional stress term was small in relation to overall stresses.\nCalibration of the transport results was accomplished by comparing areal nitrate concentrations results from the simulations with nitrate data from the wells and springs. No rigorous calibration techniques, such as parameter estimation, were used in the calibration process because such techniques likely would have required changes to the underlying hydraulic parameters in the already-calibrated ESRP model, which was not part of the process. Therefore, calibration was done mostly using trial and error techniques.\nCalibration began by taking the nitrogen source layer as representing current source conditions, and then adjusting it to start in 1910. County agricultural statistics for the six counties that overlap with Skinner and Donato (2003) were used to determine the total numbers of agricultural acres and dairy cattle. Those statistics were used to approximate the percentage of current nitrogen load that could be used to represent the 90-year period. The amount of available nitrogen loading was increased during sequential model time steps by a factor related to those statistics (fig. 4) . The result of the simulation, therefore, represents the end of a 90-year historical period simulation based on the increase in the area's crop farming and the introduction and increase of dairy farms.\nComparing maps of measured ground-water nitrate concentration data from the Skinner and Donato (2003) study area and simulated ground-water nitrate concentration data from this study and graphs of measured and simulated spring nitrate concentration data showed that the model was reasonably able to simulate the general pattern of measured nitrate concentrations ( fig. 5) . The springs flow from a bedrock wall, in a range of elevation of hundreds of feet and are therefore represented in model layers 1 and 2. We input the vertical locations of these springs into the model, with most springs located in model layer 1. The results of simulations indicated that the model was capable of approximating the nitrate concentrations for springs in both model layers ( fig. 6 ). Simulated nitrate concentration was about 0.5 mg/L higher than data collected for a 3-year period from Box Canyon Spring and showed similar intra-annual variability. Simulated results represent nitrogen loading conditions from the same period as the measured data. The simulated results were acceptable for the objective of this project and model to simulate regional nitrate variability in response to changes in proportions of nitrogen sources."}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "Data gathered from previous studies in the mid-Snake region, including USGS RASA and NAWQA programs, allow for the development and assessment of detailed conceptual and computer simulation models.

However, the accuracy of such models will be limited because of the simplifying assumptions used in the models and uncertainty in model parameters. These limitations must be understood and considered when applying the model to resource-management issues.

The GUI was created using ESRI's royalty-free software MapObjects LT. The GUI provides a GIS interface for viewing and editing the nitrogen loading conditions, running the flow and transport model, and viewing the results of the modeling. The flow and transport model along with the GUI are collectively called the SRNSS. The components of the SRNSS and other associated files are available in a zip file that accompanies this report. One of the files, readme.txt, provides installation instructions. The appendix of this report provides detailed instructions for using the SNRSS software.\nAt startup, the SRNSS loads a base distribution of nitrogen loading and nitrate concentration distribution that represents the conditions in approximately the year 2000. The base-case run represents the end of a 90-year historical period simulation of the increase in the area's farming and the introduction and increase of dairy farms. The increases in agriculture in the area are estimated from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Census of Agriculture.\nUsers can then choose from predefined zones to increase or decrease the nitrogen loading for those zones by a multiplication factor of 0.1 to 5.0 ( fig. 8) . We delineated these predefined zones to maintain political, hydrological, and predominant land-use boundaries while preventing any one zone from becoming so small that the SRNSS could not simulate that zone effectively. For the same reason, the SRNSS does not allow users to create loading zones. After users edit the nitrogen loading zones, the SRNSS software prompts the users to run MODFLOW-MOC3D with the new nitrogen loading conditions. When MODFLOW-MOC3D completes its model run, the results are displayed in the simulator, allowing users to view the results in 5-year increments up to 30 years.\nAltering the nitrogen loading factors simulates land-use changes for a zone. Nitrogen loads represent an entire zone that can contain multiple land-use types. Therefore, a change in nitrogen loading will represent a change from one predominant land use to another for the entire zone. The loading factor selected depends on the type of land-use change being modeled. For instance, a land-use change from rangeland to agriculture results in an increase in nitrogen loading that would be modeled by a loading factor between 1 and 5, depending on the amount and extent of the landuse change. Conversely, a land-use change from agriculture to residential results in a reduction of nitrogen loading and requires a loading factor between 0.1 and 0.9. Other typical land-use change scenarios would be to convert agricultural land to rangeland, resulting in a decrease of loading (or a loading factor between 0 and 1), or to increase the dairy cattle in an area, modeled with a loading factor between 1 and 5, depending on the magnitude of the increase in dairy cattle. Choosing appropriate loading factors for simulating land-use change is left to the user, however, some guidance is provided below.\nThe nitrogen loading values used by the flow and transport model are based on fertilizer, cattle manure (from dairy and beef operations), septic systems, atmospheric deposition (precipitation), and legume crops (alfalfa and beans), with the largest inputs coming from fertilizer and dairy cattle. The nitrogen input data also account for crop uptake of nitrogen, listed as crop losses. Nitrogen inputs are countylevel estimates except those for dairy cattle and atmospheric deposition. Table 1 lists the nitrogen input and loss values for each county and land-use type as estimated in Skinner and Donato (2003) , and describes the loading values for the 30-year run used to create the base case in the SRNSS flow and transport model. Table 2 lists the percentage of area that each nitrogen input type (except precipitation, which is 100 percent for each zone) occupies within each zone. Nitrogen input for dairy cattle was applied by determining spatial densities of dairy cattle from known dairy locations. Dairy cattle densities ranged from 1 to 450 animals per square mile with an increase of 33 lbs of nitrogen per acre per year for an increase of 50 per square mile ( fig. 9) . A more complete explanation of the nitrogen-loading layer is provided in Skinner and Donato (2003) .\nAn example change in nitrogen loading input follows in which the predominant land-use changes from rangeland to dairy agriculture. The high nitrogen input values in southern Gooding and western Jerome Counties are primarily due to dairy cattle inputs (figs. 3 and 9). To change the nitrogenloading estimate for other parts of Gooding County to mimic the introduction of similar dairy cattle facilities would increase nitrogen loading by a multiplication factor of 2 to greater than 4, depending on the original nitrogen input value. For example, the zone in northern Gooding County, primarily rangeland, would require a loading factor of 4 to resemble the nitrogen loading in southern Gooding County, primarily from dairy agriculture, (less than 55 lbs/acre/yr to greater than 220 lbs/acre/yr).\nIn simulating changes in nitrogen inputs, be aware that the nitrogen inputs discussed above are general values representing large areas. Small spatial changes in land use cannot be simulated effectively with the SRNSS. However, large-area land-use changes occurring over long periods are ideal scenarios to simulate with the SRNSS.

These options include:\nShowing and hiding the model grid.\nShowing and hiding basemap layers for cities, counties, lakes, roads, and streams.\nSelecting rendering options.\nZooming and panning.\n\u2022 "}, {"section_title": "To Select Rendering Options", "text": "To change the display of nitrate concentration values, select View > Renderer\u2026. The Renderer Properties dialog box lets you select minimum and maximum nitrate concentration values and a color ramp for displaying those concentrations ( fig. A10 ). You also can specify colors in which to display values that fall below or above the defined range. In the example shown in fig. A10 , a Spectrum color ramp is selected for data values between 1 and 5 mg/L. Values less than 1 mg/L will display in gray, and values greater than 5 mg/L will display in red. By experimenting with the data range and colors, you can focus on different aspects of the simulation data."}, {"section_title": "To Zoom and Pan", "text": "The plot can be zoomed by selecting the Zoom tool from the toolbar and dragging a rectangle over the area of interest ( fig. A11) . The plot will then zoom to that extent ( fig. A12 ). You can pan the view of the simulation either by using the scrollbars on the map or by selecting the Pan tool from the toolbar, holding down the left mouse button, and then dragging the mouse. To return to the full view of the simulation, click the globe button on the toolbar."}, {"section_title": "To Export a Map Image", "text": "The SRNSS software easily allows a user to export an image of the display by selecting File > Export Map ( fig.
