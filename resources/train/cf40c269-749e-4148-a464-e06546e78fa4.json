Onset is usually peripubertal and AN mainly affects females. The lifetime prevalence of AN in women is 2-4 % [5] , the median duration is 5-7 years and 30 % have an illness duration greater than 15 years [6] . AN is associated with functional and structural brain changes and some studies find that these correlate with chronicity [7] [8] [9] . Converging evidence suggests that after 3-5 years at low weight, treatment responsivity of AN lessens and outcomes become poorer, possibly due to neurotoxic effects of starvation and stress hormones (cortisol) on the brain [10, 11] . Thus, the first years after onset seem critical for successful intervention [12] . For example, 60-70 % of adolescents with AN who typically have a short illness duration (that is, <3 years) make a full recovery with family-based psychological treatments [13, 14] , whereas only about 10-30 % adults, who usually have a more enduring form of AN, achieve full remission after a course of the best available psychotherapy [15] [16] [17] [18] . Pharmacological treatments (antidepressants, antipsychotics) are largely ineffective and have low acceptability [19] [20] [21] [22] .\nCases of AN where there is a sustained (>3 years) period of being significantly underweight (body mass index (BMI) < 18.5 kg/m 2 ), can be defined as a severe and enduring eating disorder 1 (SEED) [23] [24] [25] . For this group, treatment options are limited, especially as these patients will often have had several previous unsuccessful interventions [25] . A systematic review of treatments for severe and enduring anorexia nervosa (SEED-AN [25] ) identified only one randomised controlled trial (RCT) (N = 63) comparing two psychological therapies, and reported limited improvements in both groups [23] . One further trial [26] evaluated dronabinol (a cannabinoid agonist) against placebo in patients with SEED-AN (n = 25) and found a small but significant weight gain. However, only 18% of those approached agreed to participate. Finally, deep brain stimulation (DBS) has shown promise in highly selected SEED-AN patients [27] . As DBS is an invasive procedure, it may not be an appropriate and/or desirable treatment option for the majority of patients with SEED-AN. Thus, there is a strong need for new, non-invasive treatment strategies for this group [28] . Treatment advances are most likely to arise from neuroscience-based interventions that probe and target disease mechanisms [28, 29] .\nFunctional neuroimaging studies of AN using symptom provocation paradigms have proposed aberrant functioning of 'top-down' (evaluative) prefrontal regions (involved in executive control) and/or subcortical regions promoting 'bottom-up' (stimulus-driven) responses, including anxietyrelated mesolimbic circuits, reward-related regions (for example, the striatum) and parietal somatosensory regions [30, 31] . Such findings have been incorporated into disease models that suggest that in AN, altered neural circuitry underlies phenotypic difficulties in the regulation of appetite, emotion and self-control [32] [33] [34] and the fact that AN symptoms (such as food restriction and excessive exercise) become rewarding, compulsive and/or habitual with increasing illness duration [35, 36] . This may explain the persistent nature of the illness [37] . Underpinning the hypothesis that altered self-regulation plays a key role in the development and/or maintenance of AN, a number of behavioural and neuroimaging studies have reported that individuals with AN show differences from other eating disorders (EDs) and healthy individuals on tasks of motivational self-control (see, for example, [38] ) and response inhibition (see, for example, [39] ). Neuroimaging research using such tasks has implicated the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in these cognitive processes [40] [41] [42] . Such neural models of AN and the role of the DLPFC in selfregulation provide a strong rationale for targeting the DLPFC in treatment.\nNeuromodulation techniques, such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), that directly alter brain activity provide a promising avenue for delivering precise brain-directed treatments for mental disorders, such as EDs [27, 28, [43] [44] [45] [46] . rTMS is a non-invasive procedure that can be used to stimulate (high frequency) or inhibit (low frequency) cortical activity, and the DLPFC is a widely used target. It has shown promising therapeutic effects in several psychiatric disorders [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] , leading to its approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a second line treatment for depression in the USA. It appears to increase neuroplasticity, that is, the ability of the brain to form new nerve connections, and hence rTMS is proposed to be of particular value in chronic or treatment-resistant neuro-circuit-based disorders [52] , such as SEED-AN.\nEvidence is accumulating to support rTMS as safe, well-tolerated, and of some benefit in the treatment of EDs. Two recent reviews have summarised the effects of neuromodulatory interventions, including rTMS, on ED symptoms, body weight and food intake in human and animal studies, and highlight the potential for treating EDs [45, 46] . Proof-of-concept studies in EDs have shown that in the short term, high-frequency rTMS applied to the left DLPFC reduces key symptoms [46, [53] [54] [55] . A single-session sham-controlled RCT of rTMS indicated that cue-elicited food craving can be reduced in healthy women who have high levels of food craving [56] . In bulimia nervosa, a single session of rTMS has been reported to reduce food craving, binge eating and salivary cortisol levels, suggesting the effects of rTMS on food craving involve the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis [53] . Evidence also suggests key symptoms of AN (for example, urge to restrict food intake, feeling full/fat) are reduced after a single session of rTMS to the left DLPFC [57] (20 sessions) found sustained improvements (for at least 6 months) in ED symptomatology and/or affective symptoms in five patients with SEED-AN who had had multiple unsuccessful previous treatments [58] . Finally, studies in healthy participants have shown that rTMS to the DLPFC can improve performance on selfregulation tasks, and thus it may have promise in targeting the self-regulation difficulties in EDs [59] . Given the success of rTMS to the DLPFC in treating other neurocircuit-based disorders (such as treatmentresistant depression) and the encouraging preliminary data on its effects on symptoms of AN [46, 58] , McClelland et al., unpublished observations, there is a strong rationale for further exploring the therapeutic potential of rTMS in SEED-AN.\nIn summary, the evidence base for treatment of SEED-AN is limited [23, 25] , and use of rTMS appears promising. To date, no sham-controlled RCT of therapeutic rTMS in AN has been conducted. The proposed feasibility study is an RCT comparing real (active) to sham (placebo) high-frequency rTMS to the left DLPFC as an adjunct to treatment as usual (TAU) in individuals with SEED-AN. Participants will be randomly allocated to receive 20 sessions of either real or sham rTMS. Participants' ED symptoms and other clinical outcomes will be measured before, during, immediately after and 3 months after treatment. Additionally, the effects of rTMS on neuropsychological processes such as self-regulation, attentional bias and food choice behaviour will be explored. Neuroimaging measures will be used pre-and post-treatment to explore neural mechanisms underlying treatment effects. Lastly, participants will be interviewed about their experiences of this treatment."}, {"section_title": "Aims", "text": "The specific objectives of the proposed feasibility study are to:\n(1)establish the feasibility of conducting a large-scale RCT of rTMS in patients with SEED-AN by assessing recruitment, attendance and retention rates; (2)determine the best instruments for measuring outcomes in a full trial by examining the quality, completeness and variability in the data; (3)estimate the treatment effect sizes and standard deviations for outcome measures to inform the sample size calculation for a large-scale RCT; (4)evaluate whether the treatment is operating as designed by analysing process measures, for example, within-session visual analogue scales (VAS) of key ED symptoms; (5)explore patients' views on the acceptability, credibility, tolerability and experience of rTMS; (6)obtain information about patients' willingness to undergo random allocation to 20 sessions of real or sham rTMS; (7)investigate neurocognitive changes underlying treatment response; and (8)investigate neural mechanisms underlying treatment response, including changes in structure, cerebral blood flow and in regional activity and functional connectivity at rest and during computer-based tasks assessing behavioural control.\nTentative underpinning hypotheses are based on pilot studies previously conducted by our group and others in patients with EDs [53, 55, 58, McClelland et al., lished observations] and other disorders that are frequently comorbid with EDs, including depression [60] [61] [62] and addictions [63] . It is predicted that, compared to sham rTMS treatment, 20 sessions of high-frequency rTMS applied to the left DLPFC will:\n(1)reduce AN symptomatology, encourage an increase in weight/BMI and improve related psychopathology (such as depression, anxiety and stress) and quality of life; (2)improve self-regulatory control, emotion regulation, attentional-bias processes, and food choice behaviour. Improvements in self-regulatory control abilities will be associated with changes in task-based neural activity and connectivity between the DLPFC and the inhibitory control network (the right inferior frontal gyrus, pre-supplementary motor area) and areas implicated in reward processing (for example, the ventral striatum [64] ); (3)alter neural activity in the DLPFC at rest (for example, cerebral blood flow) and during task performance during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which will be correlated with symptom improvement; and (4)be considered by patients as an acceptable and useful treatment adjunct for AN."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Design", "text": "This is a parallel group, double-blind, two-arm RCT.\nParticipants with SEED-AN will be randomly allocated to receive 20 sessions of either real rTMS (treatment group) or sham rTMS (control group) on consecutive weekdays.

Given the paucity of effective treatments for adult AN, specifically SEED-AN, new treatments are needed. In light of this, and with the growing understanding of the neural underpinnings of AN, research into novel non-invasive brain-directed therapeutic approaches is warranted [28, 45, 46] . This paper has outlined the protocol for a feasibility trial that will inform future studies (for example, provide effect sizes for a large RCT) and add to the evidence for braindirected interventions for AN [57, 58, 104] , McClelland et al., unpublished observations. Strengths of the study include the use of an individualised (neuronavigated) neuromodulation technique. Moreover, the protocol is designed to probe disease mechanisms (that is, with the inclusion of multiple structural and functional neuroimaging measures) and will provide important insight into the neural correlates of the therapeutic effect. Finally, the protocol adheres to guidance on the optimal conduct of neuromodulation trials [105] [106] [107] . Several potential practical and operational issues may pose challenges to the timely completion of this study, particularly with regards to recruitment and attrition. Patients with AN are often ambivalent about treatment and this is reflected in poor take-up rates of certain treatments (for example, medications leading to weight gain) and high drop-out rates [108] . Whilst rTMS appears promising in AN, it is unclear what the take-up, attendance, and retention rates will be if this is offered to SEED-AN patients. Although participants who took part in our previous single-session rTMS trials [McClelland et al., unpublished observations] showed interest in having rTMS therapeutically, adherence and completion of the treatment may prove challenging, for example, if the participant believes they are receiving sham, if the treatment is too uncomfortable or if the research is too cumbersome.\nAlthough we are using the most up-to-date equipment with an improved sham coil that elicits a more realistic TMS-like sensation, it is not clear whether participants, especially those who may have previous experience of rTMS in other research studies, will be able to distinguish between the real and sham treatment and what impact this will have on attrition rates. However, in our previous RCT of a single rTMS session in people with AN there was no difference between groups in the ability to correctly guess stimulation type [McClelland et al., unpublished observations].\nIt will be important to ascertain patients' willingness to undergo random allocation to real or sham rTMS. This is not trivial, as rTMS is a relatively demanding treatment, requiring daily attendance for an extended period. However, this type of RCT is considered the gold-standard method of evaluating the clinical efficacy of rTMS treatment in other disorders, such as depression [50] . Providing participants who were randomised to receive sham rTMS with the opportunity to receive real rTMS after they have completed the study is thought to be critical in encouraging recruitment and participant retention. Addressing these challenges will be particularly useful in informing the development of future large-scale RCT of rTMS in EDs.\nIn summary, research into novel treatments for SEED-AN is essential. rTMS is a promising neuromodulatory technique that has shown preliminary benefit in AN, including individuals with SEED-AN. This innovative feasibility RCT will be the first to systematically assess the acceptability, efficacy and neural correlates of this promising treatment in comparison to an active control condition. This will provide a foundation for the development of future large-scale RCTs and, if the results are positive, will provide support for the implementation of this as a treatment adjunct in clinical practice."}, {"section_title": "Trial status", "text": "Participant recruitment and data collection for this study began in August 2015.
