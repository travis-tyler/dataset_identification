Different measures include the number of food outlets within a predetermined area, [12] [13] [14] [15] distance to the nearest food outlet, 9, 16 and densities of food outlets in various forms. 8, [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] Whereas some studies employed only 1 of these measures, others examined multiple measures to investigate the consistency of effects. [22] [23] [24] A second explanation for the mixed results centers on particular covariates included or missing from the analysis. Although 1 line of research focuses on the home food environment, few studies that focused on the neighborhood food environment also included covariates that described the home food environment. If covariates that accurately describe the home food environment are not accounted for, behavioral choices may possibly mask or confound associations between obesity and neighborhood food environment measures.\nTwo reviews concluded that commonly used measures of food availability at home (which the reviews discussed in detail) had various limitations. 25, 26 Although open inventories examined by researchers can capture any type of food available at home, they are labor intensive and constrained by the time points of data collection. 25 Other measures, such as predefined inventory checklists, food frequency questionnaires, and self-reported checklists, include a limited number of items, most of which focus on fruits and vegetables. 25, 26 In addition, a biomarkerbased observational study 27 indicated that both food frequency questionnaires and 24-hour recalls are subject to considerable measurement errors, and the bias is larger for food frequency questionnaires. The availability of household-level scanner data in multiple years enabled us to generate a comprehensive home food environment measure with an extended period of time and potentially less bias. This measure indicates households' compliance with the US Department of Agriculture's (USDA) recommended food purchase shares by food category, which are designed for households that would like to meet the Dietary Guidelines for Americans for at-home food consumption, even on a limited budget. 28 In this sense, it is related to a substantial body of literature that examines the association between overall dietary patterns and various health outcomes. These studies' findings are summarized in a number of review articles. [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] A broader review of studies found that there is an inverse relationship between compliance with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and obesity. [34] [35] [36] By including a novel home food environment variable, as well as rich measures of the neighborhood food environment, our study addressed some of these confounding issues and other deficiencies in the literature. Following a number of related studies and research recommendations, 1, 37 our research was premised on the social environmental approach to health and health interventions, which places emphasis on how the health of individuals is influenced not only by biological and genetic functioning and predisposition, but also by social and familial relationships, environmental contingencies, and broader social and economic trends. 38(p150) Our research, therefore, investigated how obesity and overweight status was influenced by (1) individual-level factors, including age, gender, and several self-reported behavior responses; (2) household-level factors, including race, ethnicity, education, income, and a home food environment measure that indicated the overall healthfulness of a household's aggregate food-at-home purchases; and (3) neighborhood-level factors, including county-level densities of various food store types, poverty rates, metro status, and a census tract-level indicator of food desert status as defined by the USDA."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": "We compiled a multilevel data set from several sources. 39 We categorized children with BMIs lower than the 85th percentile for their age and gender as being underweight or normal weight, those with BMIs greater than or equal to the 85th percentile but lower than the 95th percentile as overweight, and those with BMIs greater than or equal to the 95th percentile as obese. 40 Individual-Level Variables \"Diet feature\" was a factor analysis score constructed from 7 MedProfiler questions related to special diets, including high-fiber, high-protein, low-calorie, low-carbohydrate, low-fat, low-salt, and low-sugar diets. All responses to these dietary features were either yes (coded as 1) or no (0). Additional covariates included individuals' age, gender, whether they ate at a fast-food restaurant on most days of a week (\"fast food\"), and whether they exercised for at least 20 minutes per day on most days of a week (\"exercise\")."}, {"section_title": "Household-Level Variables", "text": "Household-level demographic characteristics, including race/ethnicity, household size, income, education, and marital status, were available directly from the IRi Consumer Panel.\nOne of the main household-level measures in our analysis, USDAScore, reflected the home food environment and was constructed from the detailed food purchase information in the IRi Consumer Panel. Following Volpe and Okrent, 28 USDAScore measured adherence of a household's monthly expenditure shares of 24 aggregated food categories-defined by the USDA's Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion (CNPP)-to the recommended values based on USDA food plans. We calculated the USDAScore by a squared-error loss function:\nwhere CNPPExpShare jf is the recommended household-specific food expenditure share for household j in CNPP food category f and ExpShare jfm is household j's actual expenditure share in category f in month m. The recommended shares varied across households depending on household demographics, which included the age of male household head, age of female household head, and presence and age of children. Table  1 lists the 24 food categories and shows how the expenditure shares based on USDA food plan recommendations for each category compared with observed average expenditures in the sample. Further explanation of this score can be found in Volpe and Okrent. 28 In this study, we used the 5-year average of the monthly scores (USDAScore) for households that stayed in the IRi panel from 2008 to 2012, thus emphasizing the long-term impact that the at-home food environment might have on obesity."}, {"section_title": "Neighborhood-Level Variables", "text": "We collected data on the average number of food stores or restaurants per 10 000 county residents. Definitions and specific examples of each category can be found in Morland et al. 41 We extracted numbers of establishments from the 2008 County Business Patterns and divided them by county-level population estimates for the corresponding year. Previous studies adopted similar density measures at various geographic levels to investigate their relationship with individual weight outcomes. 3, 17, 21 Note that our 2008 store density measures lagged the obesity and overweight status variables by 4 years; we intended that this lag would lessen any potential endogeneity problems associated with the mutual relationship between consumer preferences and availability of food outlets. 42, 43 Additional neighborhood-level covariates included county-level poverty rates, metro versus nonmetro classification, and food desert status measured at the census tract level. We included county-level poverty rates as a covariate because studies have shown that disadvantaged communities are especially vulnerable to adverse food environments. Urban and rural areas generally differ in their food landscapes. Important factors that determine store choice and food choice, such as population density or vehicle ownership, also differ along the rural-urban divide. Metro versus nonmetro location was a binary variable, with 1 denoting metropolitan counties and 0 indicating nonmetro counties. According to the 2013 Rural-Urban Continuum Codes, metropolitan counties are divided into 3 subcategories by population: 1 million or more, 250 000 to 1 million, and fewer than 250 000. 44 Census tracts referred to as food deserts must meet both low-income and low-access thresholds defined by the USDA. 45 Lowincome communities are tracts that have \"either a poverty rate of 20 percent or greater, or a median family income at or below 80 percent of the area median family income.\" Low-access communities, which differed between metro and nonmetro areas, were defined as tracts with \"at least 500 persons and/or at least 33% of the census tract's population live more than one mile (10 miles for non-metro tracts) from a supermarket or large grocery store.\" 45 "}, {"section_title": "Statistical Analysis", "text": "We calculated descriptive statistics for the variables at each level.

The 2 dependent variables in the models involved 2 comparisons: (1) underweight or normal-weight versus overweight individuals and (2) underweight or normal-weight versus obese individuals. All models employed the variables at the 3 levels discussed earlier in the Methods section as independent variables. We calculated the conditional intraclass correlation coefficient for each model. We performed all statistical analyses using Stata version 13 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX)."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": "About one third of the total sample was overweight and about one third was obese, which was consistent with statistics based on other nationally representative surveys such as the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES; Table 2 ). Individuals in our adult sample had an average BMI of 28.50, which was comparable to a calculation by Flegal et al. of 28.7 for US adults based on measured heights and weights in the 2009 to 2010 NHANES. 46 More than 85% of the households were non-Hispanic White and more than half had a college-educated household head. The average household size was 2 and the mean household income was estimated to be above $69 000.\nResults from multilevel random intercept logistic models are presented in Table 3 . Almost all the individual-level demographics and lifestyle choices were significantly associated with obesity or overweight status. "}, {"section_title": "Continued", "text": "Specifically, age was positively associated with obesity or overweight status, and being female was negatively associated with obesity or overweight status. A higher diet feature score was related to a higher probability of being obese or overweight, which was expected if individuals adopted special diets (low-fat, low-sugar, low-salt, etc.) when concerned about their weight or BMI. Although regular fast-food consumption was positively associated with obesity status, it was not significantly associated with overweight status. Finally, regular exercise was negatively related to the probability of obesity or overweight. The household-level food environment measure, USDAScore, was negatively associated with the probability of obesity, after we controlled for a number of individual-, household-, and neighborhood-level covariates. However, it was not significantly associated with overweight status. A 1-point increase in average USDAScore would decrease the odds of obesity status by about 7% (odds ratio [OR] = 0.93; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.90, 0.96). On the basis of estimates of parameters from this model, we predicted the average probabilities of obesity with increasing levels of USDAScores by gender. The estimated probability of obesity for individuals living in households with the highest USDAScores (USDAScore = 13) was about 0.15 lower than for those in households with the lowest USDAScores (USDAScore = 1). Additional analysis indicated that county-level obesity rates were negatively correlated with average USDAScores at the county level (Pearson correlation coefficient = -0.12; P < .001).\nResults from other household-level measures indicated significant socioeconomic disparities in obesity or overweight status. Compared with Whites, Non-Hispanic Blacks were more likely to be obese or overweight, whereas Asians had significantly lower probabilities of being obese or overweight. Although higher income was associated with lower odds of obesity, it was related to higher odds of being overweight. Individuals living in families with college-or post-college-educated household heads were less likely to be obese than those whose household heads had a high school education or less. Household size and marital status were not significantly associated with obesity or overweight status.\nAfter adjustment for individual-and household-level characteristics, most store count measures of the neighborhood food environment were not significantly associated with obesity or overweight status. One exception was that densities of full-service restaurants were negatively associated with obesity status (OR = 0.97; 95% CI = 0.94, 0.99). County-level poverty rates were not significantly associated with obesity or overweight status. Living in metropolitan counties was significantly associated with lower odds of being obese. The tract-level food desert indicator was positively associated with obesity or overweight. With other factors remaining constant, a census tractlevel switch from a non-food desert to a food desert increased an individual's odds of being obese by about 30% (OR = 1.30; 95% CI = 1.06, 1.59) and of being overweight by about 19% (OR = 1.19; 95% CI = 1.02, 1.38)."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "Our study is among the first to encompass the roles of both food at home and the neighborhood food environment, along with a host of important controls, in studying obesity and overweight status prevalence. Our main food-at-home measure, USDAScore, largely performed in a manner consistent with dietary-quality indices used by other studies, in that higher compliance with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans was associated with lower risk of obesity status. 34, 35 Additional models, with USDAScore quartiles in place of the continuous USDAScores, showed that only high compliance or higher quartiles of USDAScores were associated with lower odds of being obese (Table A , available as a supplement to the Clubs and supercenters (n = 2 103) 0.18 60.18\nConvenience stores (n = 2 103) 0.71 60.71\nSpecialty food stores (n = 2 103) 0.62 60.61\nPharmacies and drug stores (n = 2 103) 1.58 60.85\nFull-service restaurants (n = 2 103) 7.45 64.12\nLimited-service restaurants (n = 2 103) 6.09 62.19\nPoverty rate f (n = 1 583) 16.37 65.86\nMetro area g (n = 2 104) 47.34\nFood desert tract h (n = 14 511) 5.66\nNote.

All responses to these dietary features were either yes (coded as 1) or no (0). online version of this article at http://www. ajph.org). Overall, the food environment at the neighborhood level generally had less significant impact on overweight and obesity than individual-or household-level characteristics. Similar to what was reported by Mehta and Chang, 21 higher densities of full-service restaurants were found to be associated with lower odds of being obese in this study. In contrast to most store format density measures, living in food desert tracts posed relatively strong risks for getting overweight or obese. Additionally, households in metro areas had a lower probability of being obese, which concurred with findings based on data from the 2005 to 2008 NHANES. 47 We checked the robustness of our findings by estimating models applied to metro and nonmetro subsamples. Although descriptive statistics for the metro subsample differed significantly from those for the nonmetro subsample (Table B , available as a supplement to the online version of this article at http:// www.ajph.org), estimation results from the subsamples were generally consistent throughout and similar to those from the full sample, with a few exceptions (Tables C and D, available as supplements to the online version of this article at http://www.ajph. org). Mixed results were found for the relationships between neighborhood food environment variables and obesity or overweight status. On the one hand, a food desert indicator was positively related to obesity or overweight status in the metro subsample. On the other hand, relationships between densities of various store types and obesity status had no strong or consistent pattern. Nonetheless, some of our mixed results were similar to those of other research. Consistent with the findings of Courtemanche and Carden 2 and of Volpe et al. 48 that increased expenditure shares from supercenters could reduce the healthfulness of households' shopping basket, our study found that higher densities of club stores and supercenters were associated with higher odds of overweight or obesity status in our nonmetro subsample.\nAlthough our study addressed some gaps in current research, several measurement issues are worth noting. First, rather than using traditional retrospective approaches employing food frequency questionnaires or Because of the small number in the underweight population, we combined the underweight and normal-weight population as the reference category. b Random-intercept logit models.\n24-hour recalls, our study used scanner data to provide potentially more accurate information about the home food environment. However, the scanner data reflected purchases rather than consumption. Additionally, the scanner data and our USDAScore measure accounted only for food-at-home purchases, not food away from home. However, by controlling for fast-food consumption via responses in the MedProfiler data set, we sought to mitigate the effects of potentially omitted food-awayfrom-home variables. Our diet feature variable also accounted for individuals' food choices and dietary restrictions. Second, our study relied on self-reported information found in IRi's MedProfiler data and might be subject to various measurement errors. A systematic review of previous studies comparing self-reported with measured heights and weights concluded that, in general, heights tend to be overreported and weights are underreported, leading to underestimated BMIs. 49 However, this bias has been shown to be small and stable in the past 3 decades in the United States. 50 If it was true for our sample, then the overweight and obesity prevalence might be slightly higher than what our data suggest.\nThird, the number of food stores or restaurants per capita basically identified a \"supply ratio,\" but it did not take into consideration geographic distance and mobility obstacles to access the food outlets that might be measured if data were geocoded. 18 However, the density measures were supplemented by the food desert indicator variable, which measured access to a supermarket or large grocery store within a predetermined distance, and which was significantly associated with obesity and overweight status in this study."}, {"section_title": "CONTRIBUTORS", "text": "D.
