In recent work on this topic, I reframed the debate about the relationship between college quality and graduates' earnings to focus on the reconciliation of empirical evidence and social theories. In other words, social theories (such as human capital theory) and everyday observations suggest that college quality should have a substantial economic effect, while the majority of the empirical work suggested instead that college quality has only a small, though statistically significant, effect on graduates' earnings. My focus was on the social role of these prestigious institutions; however, in talking with colleagues and presenting my work in various venues, I found that the most frequently question was how to accurately measure college quality. The critique is simple and clear: Any single measure of college quality is not capable of capturing the complexity of higher education institutions; thus, any conclusion based on a particular measure of college quality may be misleading.\nIt is necessary, then, to look closely at measures of college quality. To that end, I pose the following questions to guide this inquiry:\n1. What were the most commonly used measures of college quality in previous studies?\n2. In using these measures, did researchers arrive at different empirical results?\nI hypothesized that perhaps the best way to evaluate the differences caused by different measures of college quality would be to evaluate the effect of college quality by an array of quality measures using the same data set, and then to compare the results with those in previous studies which used one particular measure of college quality. Continuing, if the estimates indeed vary by different measures of college quality, then the next question would be whether the accepted wisdom that it pays to attend high-quality institutions still holds, given that different measures of college quality also affect the average costs of attending institutions of varying quality.\nIn posing these questions, I treat college quality as a \"black box,\" quoting one professor's critique. That is, I am not modeling the infinite characteristics of those high-quality institutions, such as smarter peers, better resources, and higher level of academic and social engagement, to name but a few aspects; and I am not examining the detailed sources of the presumed positive effect of high-quality institutions. Further, in asking these questions, I still maintain the convenient assumption that college quality is somehow measurable. Admittedly, phrases such as \"college quality\" and \"high-quality colleges\" may sound ambiguous and suspect to some researchers. They suggest that such terms as \"selectivity\" seem more concrete and easier to measure. Nonetheless, I choose to use \"college quality,\" partly because it is the term used in previous studies (and my goal is to reconcile the differences in those studies), and partly because students and their families do care about the quality of colleges they attend. This article first presents an overview of previous studies on the economic effect of college quality, with an emphasis on their methodological approach, measures of college quality, and main findings. Then I set up a baseline model using a national data set (Baccalaureate and Beyond: 93/97) and one popular measure of college quality in recent research work (Barron's ratings) to estimate the effect of college quality and further to examine whether it pays to attend high-quality colleges.\nI then use the same baseline model and the same data set but different measures of college quality to explore the possible differences among the estimates for different measures. I consider three additional measures at this stage: mean SAT scores of the entering freshman class, tuition and fees, and Carnegie institutional classifications. Based on regression results, I reevaluate the main policy question: Does it pay to attend high-quality colleges? In the concluding section, I summarize all the findings and answer the original question: Do measures of college quality matter? I also explore some implications of this analysis for future research on this topic."}, {"section_title": "LITERATURE REVIEW", "text": "Generally speaking, the modern literature on the economic effect of college quality began in the late 1960s and early 1970s with studies by Weisbrod and Karpoff (1968) , Wales (1973) , Wachtel (1975), and Wise (1975) . Pascarella and Terenzini completed a summary and critique of this literature in 1991. After about 20 years, the subject has undergone a renaissance beginning in the late 1990s with works by Behrman et al. (1996) , Brewer and Ehrenberg (1996) , Brewer et al. (1999) , Dale and Krueger (2002) , and Thomas (2000 Thomas ( , 2003 . Not only were the results of these studies important for academic and theoretical purposes, but they were also important to prospective students and their parents, who were paying an increasing fraction of the steadily increasing costs of higher education, especially at prestigious institutions (Ehrenberg, 2000) .\nRepresentative studies on the effect of college quality included Weisbrod and Karpoff (1968) , Reed and Miller (1970) , Wales (1973) , Solmon (1973 Solmon ( , 1975 , Solmon and Wachtel (1975) , Wise (1975) , Wachtel (1976) , Griffin and Alexander (1978) , Morgan and Duncan (1979) , Trusheim and Crouse (1981) , Mueller (1988) , Kingston and Smart (1990) , Karabel and McClelland (1987) , Smart (1988 ), Fox (1993 , James et al. (1989) , Loury and Garman (1995) , Rumberger and Thomas (1993) , Behrman, Rosenzweig, and Taubman (1996) , Ehrenberg (1996), Brewer, Eide, and Ehrenberg (1999) , Dale and Krueger (2002) , and Thomas (2000 Thomas ( , 2003 . Although the list was by no means exhaustive, it included most of the published, methodologically rigorous studies. Brewer et al. (1999) provided an excellent overview and summary of some of the studies listed above. Almost without exception, these studies used more or less the same methods: Individual i's log earnings or hourly wage rate (ln(Y i )) was a function of the quality of institution j he or she actually attended (Q ij ), demographic characteristics (D i ), family background (F i ), academic background (A i ), job market conditions (J i ), and an individual disturbance term (m i ). In mathematical notation, ln\nPopular measures of college quality included mean SAT scores of entering freshmen (Dale & Krueger, 2002; Griffin & Alexander, 1978; Morgan & Duncan, 1979; Mueller, 1988; Solmon, 1973 Solmon, , 1975 , 2003 Wise, 1975) , Gourman rating (Solmon, 1973 (Solmon, , 1975 Wales, 1973) , Carnegie classification (Solmon & Wachtel, 1975) , tuition (Smart, 1988) , expenditure per FTE student (Morgan & Duncan, 1979; Wachtel, 1976) , and Barron's ratings (Brewer & Ehrenberg, 1996; Brewer et al., 1999) .\nEarly research usually used the conventional ordinary least squares (OLS) technique (e.g., Wales, 1973; Weisbrod & Karpoff, 1968) . Structural equation models have sometimes been employed to examine the direct and indirect effect of college quality on earnings (e.g., Mueller, 1988) . Recent studies paid more attention to the econometric problems in estimating the earnings equation (e.g., Equation 1). For example, Behrman et al. (1996) used data on female twins to control for common unobserved effects, and Brewer and Ehrenberg (1996) and Brewer et al. (1999) used structural models to allow for the correction of selection bias. Thomas (2000 Thomas ( , 2003 employed a hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) technique to entertain the multi-level structure of the survey data.\nThese studies' findings were not completely unequivocal. Some studies, for example, demonstrated significant and handsome economic benefits from attending high-quality colleges. A recent exemplary study was Brewer et al. (1999) . After controlling for gender, race/ethnicity, family size, parental education, test scores, and part-time job, they found that students who attended private elite institutions enjoyed a large salary premium. In contrast, other studies have indicated either statistically nonsignificant or even negative effects of college quality on earnings. For example, Dale and Krueger (2002) found that college quality had nonsignificant effects on earnings after controlling for some salient, confounding variables.\nSetting aside those studies with \"extreme\" results (both strongly positive and negative effects), most studies suggested that college quality had a statistically significant though generally very small effect on earnings (Pascarella & Terenzini, 1991) . For example, a study by Solman and Wachtel (1975) analyzed a sample of white male college attendees in the 1943 NBERThorndike survey, which reported 1969 earnings. They found that college quality, assessed at the mean, had a statistically significant but economically very small effect on earnings: only about an additional 1% of the vari-ance in 1969 earnings above and beyond control variables. Mueller (1988) reached a similar conclusion, confirming that college quality could explain only a minute percentage of variance in earnings above and beyond the controls. In a more recent study using a nationally representative sample of 4,061 college graduates in 1992, Thomas (2000) found that college quality had a small but statistically significant effect on earnings one year after college graduation. Findings of most studies belonged to this category: College quality had a small although statistically significant effect on college graduates' earnings.\nIt is noteworthy that different measures of college quality might be partially responsible for the varying magnitudes of the estimated effects of college quality. For example, studies using mean SAT scores usually found a relatively small effect of college quality (e.g., Dale & Krueger, 2002; Mueller, 1988; Thomas, 2000) , and those using Barron's ratings often resulted in a relatively large effect of college quality (e.g., Brewer & Ehrenberg, 1996; Brewer et al., 1999) . Of course, these differences could also result from other factors such as different data sets and estimation strategies. Thus, to replicate their findings in a single data set using a uniform estimation strategy but different measures of college quality would be an ideal method of showing whether measures of college quality contribute to the differences among previous results. Further, because attending a high-quality institution usually means higher costs relative to attending other colleges, it would be important to show whether the earnings premium of college quality is large enough to offset the corresponding cost differences among colleges of varying quality."}, {"section_title": "THE BASELINE MODEL", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data Set", "text": "The major data set I used in this analysis is the second follow-up of the Baccalaureate and Beyond study (B&B: 93/97). B&B is a national longitudinal study designed to provide information concerning education and work experiences after completion of the baccalaureate degree. It provides (a) cross-sectional information one year after completion of the bachelor's degree and (b) longitudinal data concerning entry into and progress through graduate-level education and the work force. The second B&B follow-up was conducted in April 1997 with more than 10,000 baccalaureate recipients who completed their degrees between July 1992 and June 1993. I used the restricted data set to match up students with institutions. All analyses reported in this paper have been weighted by the B&B second follow-up weights, normalized on final samples."}, {"section_title": "Variables", "text": "The outcome of interest in this study is earnings, measured as the annualized self-reported earnings in the graduates' primary job in April of 1997. The main independent variable is college quality; and other control variables include various demographic, family backgrounds, academic, labor market factors. Demographic variables consist of gender and race/ethnicity, consisting of such dummy variables as \"female,\" \"Hispanic,\" \"Black,\" and \"Asian.\" Family background variables consist of \"family income\" and \"firstgeneration college graduate.\" Academic variables include college majors (divided into business, education, engineering, health, public affairs, biological science, social science, math/science, history, humanity, psychology, and other majors) and student academic performance (measured as merged SAT/ACT quartiles). Finally, labor market variables include age, tenure, and their square terms. Because B&B reports only annual earnings instead of hourly wage rate, I used the number of work hours per week as an adjustment."}, {"section_title": "Measure of College Quality", "text": "The college quality variables in the baseline model are constructed from two sources including the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System 1992-93 (IPEDS) and Barron's Profiles of American Colleges. I extract the variable \"types of institutional control\" (i.e., public versus private) from IPEDS. College selectivity data are from Barron's Profiles of American Colleges. Barron's rating categorizes institutions into six selectivity groups on the basis of entering students' class rank, high school grade point average, average SAT scores, and the percentage of applicants admitted.\nIn the baseline model, I follow the conventional approach by collapsing six selectivity categories into three based on a rating of most competitive or highly competitive (with Barron's rating of 5 or 4), very competitive or competitive (with Barron's rating of 3 or 2), and less competitive or noncompetitive (with Barron's rating of 1 or 0). Because perceptions of public and private institutions are quite different, I further distinguish between privately and publicly controlled institutions in each selectivity group. This function yielded six college types: high-quality private, high-quality public, middle-quality private, middle-quality public, low-quality private, and lowquality public. This measure of college quality was used in Brewer and Ehrenberg (1996) and Brewer et al. (1999) ."}, {"section_title": "Sample", "text": "I took the full sample of the second follow-up of B&B and limited it to graduates who (a) received bachelors' degrees between July 1992 and June 1993, (b) were working full-time, as of April 1997, with annual earnings between $1,000 and $500,000 per year, (c) were not enrolled in school full- time, and (d) had institutional-level data available. These criteria limited the final sample to 3,965 students across 500 institutions. Table 1 presents the descriptive statistics of variables used in the baseline model for this final sample. In Table 2 is the distribution of students in each type of institution. For this particular measure of college quality, only about 11% of all graduates in the final sample are from high-quality institutions. I will return to this point later when comparing different measures of college quality.\nEstimating Strategy I estimated Equation 1 using conventional OLS techniques. This model has been tested in several recent studies by Thomas (2000 Thomas ( , 2003 and Thomas and Zhang (forthcoming). I used it in this study as the baseline model for several reasons. First, it is desirable to maintain consistency with previous research (provided the model is good) so that results can be compared without confusion caused by methodological differences. Second, although it is interesting to employ statistically more advanced methods, such as correcting for selection and HLM, I intended to keep the technical aspect of this study as parsimonious as possible. Finally, I experimented with other methods, and those results did not differ substantially from the baseline model. (See the appendix for results using HLM estimation. Results from Heckman type self-selection models are also available on request.) on graduates' log earnings. Because my focus is on the effect of college quality on graduates' earnings, I will not discuss the impact of other variables in detail. An overview of the results confirms that the estimated effects of other variables are consistent with a large body of earlier work. Clearly, college quality has a large and significant impact on graduates' earnings. For example, holding all student characteristics constant, graduates from high-quality institutions-both public and private-enjoy a nearly 20% earnings premium over those from low-quality public colleges. Even graduating from middle-quality institutions yields about a 10% earnings advantage over graduation from low-quality colleges. There seems to have been no earnings advantage for students who graduate from private colleges vs. public colleges in the same quality category. The estimated effect of high-quality institutions is comparable to the findings of Brewer and Ehrenberg (1996) and Brewer et al. (1999) using several other data sets including National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972 and High School and Beyond."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "An immediate question from analyzing the effect of college quality on graduates' earnings is whether the benefits are worth the associated costs because high-quality institutions usually cost more to attend. Researchers have been very cautious about conducting such cost-benefit analyses, partly because the real costs of a college education are too complex to measure easily. It is widely held that the costs of college education should include not only direct costs (e.g., tuition, fees, living expenses, etc.) but also such indirect costs as foregone income. Fortunately, because this inquiry studies whether the benefits are worth the costs in attending a high-quality college compared to attending a low-quality college, many components of the cost which are probably common to attending both types of colleges can be omitted, making it more feasible to carry out a simple cost-benefit analysis.\nTo illustrate, suppose a high school graduate faces the following three choices: to join the labor market, to attend a low-quality college, or to attend a high-quality college. Further assume that tuition and fees, living expenses, and foregone income are the only three components of costs of attending college. The following calculation illustrates the cost-benefit analysis: Option 1. Joining the labor market L 1 B Option 2. Attending a low-quality college"}, {"section_title": "Costs Benefits", "text": "Where T refers to tuition and fees, L refers to living expenses, F refers to foregone income, and B refers to benefits. Subscript 1 refers to attending low-quality colleges, and h refers to attending high-quality colleges. Due to the inability to estimate L's, F 's, and B's, it is difficult to decide between Options 1 and 2 and between Options 1 and 3; however, it is possible, with an additional assumption which is not very strong, to make a comparison between Options 2 and 3. The additional assumption is that living expenses and foregone income are the same whether attending a low-quality college or attending a high-quality college for the same individual. Intuitively, individuals would incur the same amount of foregone earnings and living expenses as long as they choose to attend college regardless of college quality. That is, L 1 = L h and F 1 = F h . Then, Option 3 is preferred if and only if\nunder the above assumption. In other words, the decision of which type of college to attend hinges on the relative magnitude of the benefit difference, which is readily available from analyzing the effect of college quality, and the cost difference, which boils down to the difference in tuition and fees. It should be noted that adding more cost components to the table does not change the results as long as they are incurred when attending both types of colleges. More complicated analyses of net present value that may require discounting factors do not change the main point either. Table 4 shows the average tuition and fees for each type of institution. The tuition and fees are much lower and less dispersed in public institutions than in private institutions. From Table 4 , the difference in tuition and fees among different types of colleges can be calculated. For example, the average difference in tuition and fees between low-quality public institutions and high-quality private institutions is $10,633 (that is, $12,201 minus $1,568) per year. The benefit difference can be calculated by taking the coefficient in Table 3 and evaluating it at the mean of the earnings distribution. For example, the earnings difference between low-quality public institutions and high-quality private institutions is 0.1754 log points, which is about $5,890 per year when it is evaluated at the mean of the earnings distribution. With reasonable estimates for the length of a college education and the length of a career, the comparison is quite clear: The benefit difference over one's career well exceeds the cost difference.\nA question raised by this comparison is whether the benefit, i.e., the effect of college quality, is stable over an individual's career span. Thomas and Zhang (forthcoming) showed that, in the early stage of a graduate's career, the earnings differences among graduates from different types of colleges grow significantly. This result strengthens the current argument. The cost-benefit analyses can be carried out in the same way among other categories of colleges. The results seem clear: It pays to attend a high-quality college versus a low-quality college.\nOne interesting observation from this exercise is that public institutions appear to be a better investment than private institutions because the tuition level at public institutions is much lower, while the earnings advantages are comparable to private institutions in each quality category. This finding could have provided a rationale for the recent skyrocketing raises in tuition in good public institutions. Certainly this simple comparison may amplify the advantage of attending public institutions over private ones because many cost components have been suppressed from the analysis. Adding other components (which are assumed to be the same for both types of institutions) would make the relative magnitude of their costs much similar.\nThe above calculation is on a ceteris paribus basis in that the comparison is based on the coefficients from multivariate regression. Admittedly, college choice may affect other variables in the equation that in turn would change the comparison. For example, college choice could affect academic performance and undergraduate majors. It is possible that attending a highquality college might lower one's academic performance; thus, the positive effect associated with college quality could be partly offset by the negative impact associated with lower academic performance. Similarly, lucrative majors could be more competitive at high-quality colleges than at low-quality colleges. Nevertheless, given the substantial earnings advantage provided by high-quality colleges, it is safe to conclude that it pays to attend a highquality college versus a low-quality college, on average."}, {"section_title": "OTHER MEASURES OF COLLEGE QUALITY", "text": "In the baseline model, the quality measures are constructed from the Barron's ratings. Previous studies on the effect of college quality on earn- "}, {"section_title": "Institutional Type N Tuition", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "TABLE 4 AVERAGE TUITION BY COLLEGE QUALITY AND TYPES OF CONTROL", "text": "ings have used different measures of college quality, such as mean SAT score, Carnegie classification, and tuition and fees. Yet little is known about whether the estimated effect of college quality is sensitive to measures of college quality. I use these three additional measures of college quality to explore the sensitivity of the estimated effect of college quality on earnings.\nThese three measures are constructed from 1992-1993 IPEDS data. I used these data because that was the year when students in this sample graduated from college, although the measures of college quality are fairly stable over the years. The first set of college quality variables is based on the average SAT scores of the entering freshman class. Following the method used in Thomas (2000 Thomas ( , 2003 , I separate the colleges into three groups: (a) colleges with an average SAT score higher than 980 are classified as high-quality colleges, (b) those between 980 and 885 are classified as middle-quality, and (c) the remaining colleges with average SAT scores lower than 885 belong to the low-quality group. (For a detailed discussion of these thresholds, see Thomas, 2000 Thomas, , 2003 .\nSimilar to the college quality measures that I constructed from Barron's ratings, I distinguish the privately controlled institutions from the publicly controlled institutions in each SAT group. This method yields six college types of college quality measure. Table 5 presents the distribution of graduates among categories of colleges. The final sample, using the SAT score as a quality measure, is slightly smaller than the sample using the Barron's rating, because of missing values. Clearly, under this measure of college quality, more students are classified as graduates from high-quality colleges than under the measure of college quality constructed from Barron's ratings. For example, Table 5 shows that about one-third of graduates are now classified as graduates from high-quality colleges, while the Barron's ratings yielded a classification of only about 11% of all graduates from high-quality colleges. One would expect, then, that the effect of college quality as measured by SAT scores would be smaller than that measured by Barron's ratings.\nThe second measure of college quality is the 1994 Carnegie institutional classification. The Carnegie classification is based on degree programs and research funds, both of which measure some dimensions of institutional quality. Table 6 shows that, in the final sample, the largest group of students is from Comprehensive I institutions, and graduates from Research I institutions constitute the second largest group. The final sample, when the Carnegie Classification is used as a quality measure, is slightly larger than the sample when the Barron's rating is used because the Carnegie Classification variable is available for more institutions. The reference group in the following regression analysis is graduates from Liberal Arts II institutions.\nThe last measure of college quality is undergraduate tuition and fees. Although it is a very crude measure of college quality, it provides a direct and intuitive way to compare the costs of attending different types of col-leges. The accuracy of tuition and fees as a measure of college quality might be different for public and private institutions. Because of government support in the form of block grants at public institutions, the tuition and fees at public institutions are much lower and less dispersed than those at private institutions. Moreover, because the funding levels for public higher education vary for different states, the accuracy of tuition and fees as a measure of college quality for public institutions is further limited. Admittedly, a few high-quality public institutions attract a substantial proportion of their undergraduates nationally and thus charge out-of-state tuition and fees that are arguably highly relevant to college quality. However, because the number of high-quality institutions that are able to attract a large number of out-of-state students is relatively small, I use only in-state tuition and fees as a measure of college quality for public institutions, thus maintaining consistency across institutions. Generally speaking, private institutions behave more like competitive firms than their public counterparts. If college education is regarded as an investment in human capital, then I would hypothesize that tuition and fees are more correlated with returns at private institutions than at public institutions. I estimated an earnings equation similar to the baseline model for each of the above three measures of college quality. For simplicity's sake, I present only the regression coefficients for college quality variables below. (Results from the full models are available on request.) Table 7 presents the OLS estimates for the effect of college quality measured by SAT scores. As expected, the estimated effects are generally smaller than those in the baseline model where Barron's ratings are used. Results suggest that, other things being equal, graduates from high-quality public institutions enjoy about a 6% earnings advantage over those from low-quality public institutions. The comparable figure using Barron's ratings is 20%. (See Table 3.) Similarly, the earnings advantage for graduates from high-quality private institutions over graduates from low-quality institutions is about 10% (Table 7) , and the advantage is about 20% (Table 3 ). The effects of other types of colleges such as middle-quality public, low-quality private, and middle-quality private institutions are also smaller than the corresponding estimates in Table 3 . These results are consistent with Thomas's (2000 Thomas's ( , 2003 finding which used mean SAT scores as the measure of college quality.\nIt appears that the effect of college quality constructed from mean SAT score is much smaller than the effect of college quality measured by Barron's ratings. Meanwhile, as one would expect, the cost differentials among different colleges are smaller when the SAT score is used. Are the relatively small earnings differentials sufficient to cover the relatively small cost differentials? To answer this question, I tabulated the average tuition and fees level for each category of college. (See Table 8 .) The numbers show that the average tuition and fees for high-quality colleges measured by mean SAT score are lower than the corresponding tuition and fees at high-quality institutions measured by Barron's ratings. From Table 8 , the difference in tuition and fees can be calculated. For example, the differential between low-quality public institutions and high-quality private institutions is $9,445 per year. The benefit differential can be calculated by taking the coefficient in Table 7 and evaluating it at the mean of earnings distribution. For example, the benefit differential between low-quality public institutions and high-quality private institutions evaluated at the mean of the earnings dis-tribution is $3,248 per year. With reasonable estimates for the length of college education and the length for career time, the conclusion that it pays to attend high-quality colleges still holds. The same pattern of the difference between public and private institutions within each quality category is also notable. Note: Also controlled for other variables as in Table 3 . Standard errors are corrected for heteroscedasticity. Grubb's (1992) findings. Using a nationally representative sample of high school graduates in 1972 (with 1986 earnings data), he found that the economic effect of graduating from a Liberal Arts I institution was among the highest of all Carnegie categories. The contradictory finding in the current analysis may be due to the relatively short period of time after graduation in the sample. If most graduates from Liberal Arts I institutions obtain post-graduate degrees, then the comparison between baccalaureate holders between Liberal Arts I and Liberal Arts II institutions likely underestimates the effect of Liberal Arts I institutions. Another possibility is that graduates from different types of institutions may have different earnings trajectories over their careers (e.g., Thomas & Zhang, forthcoming) ; thus, the earnings profile 10 years after graduation (as in Grubb's study) could be quite different from the profile four to five years after graduation (as in this analysis).\nSimilarly, I ask whether the cost differentials are offset by the earnings differentials among institutions of Carnegie categories. Table 10 shows a general pattern of positive association between average costs and benefits. For example, average Research I institutions charge higher tuition and fees than Research II institutions (Table 10) , and the estimated effect of the former is also larger than that of the latter (Table 9 ). The same results hold for Doctoral I and II institutions.\nMore interestingly, Table 10 shows that the average tuition and fees of Comprehensive II institutions are higher than those of Comprehensive I institutions, and somehow, surprisingly, the estimated effect of Compre- hensive II institutions is larger than that of Comprehensive I institutions.\nAs an exception, the earnings differential between graduates from Liberal Arts I institutions and Liberal Arts II institutions does not appear to be sufficiently large to cover the differential in tuition and fees. Finally, Table 11 presents the estimates for the effect of college quality measured by tuition and fees (in $1,000s) by types of institutional control. The first row presents a pooled model with a dummy variable indicating types of institutional control. Results show that tuition and fees are positively related to graduates' earnings. The results in the first row, however, do not reveal potentially different patterns of the effect of college quality (as measured by tuition and fees) between private and public institutions. It is clear from Tables 4 and 8 that the tuition and fees charged at private institutions are generally higher and more dispersed than at public institutions.\nMy hypothesis is that the effect of college quality as measured by tuition and fees should be larger at private institutions than at public institutions. To test this hypothesis, separate regressions are fitted for private and public institutions. The results appear in the second and third rows. For private institutions, a $1,000 increase in tuition and fees is associated with about a 2.4% increase in graduates' earnings, which, in dollar terms, is about $733 evaluated at the mean of the log earnings.\nFor public institutions, the effect is lower. A $1,000 increase in tuition and fees is associated with about a 1.8% increase in graduates' earnings, which in dollar terms is about $570 evaluated at the mean of the log earnings. For both private and public institutions, however, the benefit is large enough to cover the tuition and fees differentials. The insignificance of the estimated effect of tuition and fees at public institutions suggests that, as "}, {"section_title": "SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION", "text": "The standard critique of efforts to measure college quality is unambiguously expressed as follows: In studying the relationship between college quality and graduates' earnings, researchers often measure college by a single index, which is not capable of capturing the complexity of higher education institutions; thus, any conclusion based on a particular measure of college quality may be misleading. My defense is also clear. Instead of judging what the best measure of college quality is, I focus on understanding how different measures of college quality may lead to different estimated effects of college quality on graduates' earnings. If the estimated effect of college quality is sensitive to the measures of quality used, then those different measures may provide partial explanations for the different estimated effects of college quality in previous studies. Further, if the estimated effect of college quality is sensitive to the measures of college quality, it is also important to examine whether the common wisdom that it pays to attend high-quality colleges is robust to different measures of college quality.\nI started with Barron's ratings, a popular measure of college quality in recent work on the relationship between college quality and graduates' earnings. I used these ratings to estimate an established earnings model by conventional OLS technique. Then I reestimated the earnings equation using three different measures of college quality, namely, the average SAT score of the entering class, the institution's Carnegie classification, and tuition and fees.\nThis series of analyses produced several observations. First, no matter what measures of college quality are used, the effect of college quality on earnings is generally positive and significant. For example, when I used the mean SAT scores of the entering class as a measure of college quality, the effect of high-quality private institutions is about 10%, and graduating from other categories of institutions (high-quality public, middle-quality private, and middle-quality public) is also associated with 4-8% earnings advantages relative to low-quality public institutions. When I used the institution's Carnegie classification as a measure of college quality, research institutions and doctoral institutions are associated with higher earnings relative to Liberal Arts II institutions. The only exception is that graduating from Liberal Arts I institutions does not seem to provide significant earnings advantages relative to Liberal Arts II institutions. Finally, when I used tuition and fees as an approximation of college quality, it was highly associated with graduates' earnings, especially at private institutions.\nSecond, it appears that the estimated effect of college quality is sensitive to the measure of college quality. For example, the estimated effects of college quality constructed from Barron's ratings and the mean SAT scores of the entering class are quite different. At each quality level (especially for high-quality colleges), the estimated effect of college quality is much higher with Barron's ratings than with mean SAT scores. This observation helps reconcile some of the discrepancies in previous studies. For example, using the same college quality measure constructed from Barron's ratings, Brewer et al. (1999) found that the effect of private elite colleges was approximately 20-40% above that of low-quality public institutions. However, Thomas (2003) , using the mean SAT scores of the entering class as a measure of quality, found that the effect of private elite colleges is on the order of 10% relative to low-quality institutions.\nThese varying effects of college quality should not be a surprise. My analyses show that, under different measures, the same institution (or the same group of graduates) may be classified in different categories of quality. To the extent that the estimated effect of college quality is nothing more than the differences among the mean earnings of graduates in different categories of quality, after controlling for some other factors, it is straightforward that the differences among the mean earnings will change when institutions (or graduates) are categorized in different ways.\nThird, the main point of this analysis is that, no matter what measures of college quality are used, the earnings differentials among colleges of varying qualities are sufficiently large to compensate for the difference in tuition and fees among institutions. The most direct comparison is provided by the regression with tuition and fees as the college quality measure. A $1,000 increase in tuition and fees at private institutions is associated with a $733 earnings increase annually, and at public institutions a $1,000 increase in tuition and fees is associated with a $570 earnings increase annually. Similar cost-benefit analyses are carried out for different measures of college quality, and the conclusion of the baseline model (i.e., it pays to attend a high-quality college versus a low-quality college) is quite robust.\nResults of this study have several important implications. First, in future discussions of college quality, we need to be very explicit about how college quality is measured and defined. Assuming that every higher education institution has its own effect on graduates' earnings, then the method chosen of classifying institutions into quality categories has a direct impact on the effect of that quality category because, statistically speaking, the latter is the average (sometimes weighted) of the institutional effects within each quality category. This factor is especially crucial in comparing results across different studies. Some of the discrepancies among the results from previous studies may be caused by the different measures of college quality employed.\nSecond, because this analysis compares the earnings of terminal baccalaureate recipients from different types of institutions, it perforce ignored a host of other effects of high-quality institutions. For example, graduating from certain types of institutions (such as Liberal Arts I) may not have immediate significant effects on earnings, but the longer term effect may operate through graduate education and different life-time earnings profiles than those from other institutions. As more longitudinal data are collected, it will be possible to study the long-term effects of college quality.\nThird, the common wisdom that it pays to attend high-quality institutions seems to be quite robust over an array of measures of college quality. This finding is reassuring in confirming that high-quality college education appears to be a good investment, although educational researchers may have a difficult time in identifying the sources of the advantages those highquality institutions provide. Possible explanations include peer effects, better resources, higher level of engagement, sorting effects, and possibly favoritism; however, the empirical evidence is rather thin for each possible explanations considered singly. Future research should look into characteristics that contribute to the positive effects of high-quality institutions on such student outcomes as graduates' earnings, with an eye to improving those aspects at other institutions.\nFinally, the large and significant effect of college quality may not be good news because it provides an excuse for high-quality institutions to continue to raise their already high tuition and fees in their pursuit of academic excellence. This issue becomes an equity concern, especially in light of the increasing socioeconomic stratification among college participants. Once it became possible for the majority of high school graduates in the United States to attend college, the differentiation of educational attainment shifted away from the simple college graduate/noncollege graduate dichotomy. We also know that the largest increase in the college-going population in the foreseeable future will be from the low-income families. If prestigious institutions continue to increase their tuition and fees, college quality may work to increase the socioeconomic stratification. Future research should focus on the college choice behaviors of students from poor families with particular attention paid to promoting their participation at high-quality institutions. Future research should also redirect its emphasis on the social returns to high-quality college education as an incentive for the society to provide it at a reasonable price for individuals."}, {"section_title": "APPENDIX HLM ESTIMATION OF THE BASELINE MODEL", "text": "Due to the multilevel nature (i.e., institutional and individual) of the factors shown to have effects on the outcome of interest (i.e., earnings) in this analysis, econometric techniques which characterize this multilevel characteristic, such as hierarchical linear modeling (HLM), are often recommended (Bryk & Raudenbush, 1992; Heck & Thomas, 2000) . The HLM model characterizes the multilevel nature of the data by simultaneously estimating two sets of equations, a within-unit set and a between-unit set. Taking the current analysis as an example, the within-unit set estimates the relationship between individual earnings and individual-level variables while the between-unit set estimates the relationship between the coefficients estimates from the within-unit set and institutional-level variables.\nAs a routine for HLM estimation, I first decomposed the total variance into \"within\" and \"between\" variances. The result of this simple one-way ANOVA analysis is presented in Table A .1. The majority of variance (78%) in log earnings is within colleges, while between variance makes up the remaining 22%.\nAfter the estimation of variance components, I estimated the formal HLM model using the same data as in the pooled baseline model. Table A .2 presents HLM estimates of the effects of the various demographic, family background, educational background, and labor market variables on graduates' earnings. "}]
