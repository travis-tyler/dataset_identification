[{"section_title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "B", "text": "ETTER characterization of the dynamics of land surface microwave emissivity (MWE) holds promise for improving over-land precipitation retrievals in the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) era [1] . This study concerns the forward model simulation of MWE, which consists in the coupling of a land surface model (LSM), forced by meteorological data, to a microwave emissivity model (MEM). The work presented builds off of the study of Ringerud et al. [2] , which assessed the potential of forward model simulation of MWE for GPM, by tuning the parameters of the forward models to improve predictive power. We compare calibrated forward models against uncalibrated forward models in their ability to simulate MWE. The analysis is limited to MWE, leaving the evaluation of the impact on precipitation retrievals as future work.\nThe microwave emission from the land surface is important as its signal must be separated from that of the precipitation [3] . MWE can widely vary, given its sensitivity to soil moisture and vegetation. Bare soil MWE responds to soil moisture changes due to the large dielectric constant of water, with MWE decreasing with increasing soil moisture. Vegetative cover absorbs and scatters the underlying soil MWE signal, and very dense vegetation can completely obscure the soil MWE signal. If very dense, the signal is that of vegetation alone, which is very high.\nSimilar to the work of Ringerud et al. [2] , we focus on the MWE dynamics in the U.S. Southern Great Plains (SGP; 34\n\u2022 N:39\n\u2022 N, 100\n\u2022 W:95 \u2022 W) as the SGP exhibits a large MWE variation, both spatially and temporally, attributable to the region's pronounced soil moisture and vegetation dynamics. The SGP is characterized by abundant cropland but also has representation of other land covers and a range of soil classes. Unlike the work of Ringerud et al. [2] , we restrict the focus of the study to the MWE simulation of the soil-vegetation system as snow, frozen ground, and distinct land types (e.g., deserts and wetlands) present distinctly different modeling challenges.\nFor the GPM radiometer precipitation retrievals, forward models can supply the MWE estimates that are required for simulation of top-of-atmosphere brightness temperatures. A physical database, which is searchable by the retrieval algorithm, relates a set of geophysical parameters to the brightness temperatures at all relevant frequencies and polarizations [4] - [6] . Forward modeling can also provide a supporting role by helping in determining the set of geophysical quantities (e.g., leaf area index (LAI), soil moisture, surface temperature, and total precipitable water) by which to index into the precipitation 0196-2892 \u00a9 2015 IEEE.

Current work is ongoing to assess the level of accuracy required for these fields at the algorithm level. Alternatives to forward modeling address MWE more indirectly and include the identification of \"surface-blind\" pseudochannels [7] , [8] , indexing by similarity classes based on monthly MWE climatology [9] , empirical approaches to account for recent precipitation [10] , [11] , and hybrid approaches that combine both modeling and statistical approaches [12] , [13] . The forward model configuration is similar to that by Ringerud et al. [2] , consisting of the Noah LSM (version 3.3) coupled to the land MEM of the Community Radiative Transfer Model (CRTM) developed by the Joint Center for Satellite Data Assimilation (JCSDA). Here, we also test a coupling of Noah to the Community Microwave Emission Model (CMEM) developed by the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). Both MEMs are used in globally run operational satellite data assimilation systems. We use as a benchmark the same set of cloud-cleared MWE retrievals developed by Ringerud et al. [2] but, with our focus here on the soil-vegetation system, clearing for snow and frozen-ground conditions and reserving a portion, a single warm season (April-September 2008), for calibration.\nIn intercomparison studies focused on soil moisture, including in the SGP [14] , while LSMs were found to have some skill in capturing anomalies they exhibited large root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) and biases. The story is similar for MEMs. Weng et al. [15] ran CRTM over bare soil and short grass at five microwave frequencies (4.9-94 GHz) and, while noting some ability to capture broad features, reported sizeable MWE simulation errors. Uncertainty propagation and sensitivity studies involving CMEM have also indicated large forward modeling MWE errors [16] , [17] . Ringerud et al. [2] found errors that exceeded the GPM passive microwave algorithm team assessed accuracy value of 1% or better required for the coupling of emissivity to the physical atmosphere retrieval and separation of dynamic surface emission from emission by hydrometeors in the atmosphere [2] . For reference, an accuracy value of 3% emissivity, while sufficient for retrievals of heavy rain, would be insufficient for discriminating rain/no-rain events and retrievals of lighter precipitation [3] .\nPoor specification of LSM and MEM parameters is likely a large contributor of error. On the LSM side, many parameters are specified via tables indexed by variables such as soil texture and land cover. The limitations of lookup tables are well documented for soil moisture modeling [18] , [19] and relate to the representativeness of the underlying soil databases [19] - [21] and the accuracy of the inputs (i.e., soil texture maps) [22] . On the MEM side, parameters are similarly poorly specified. Weng et al. [15] attributed much of the bias in CRTM predictions to the \"arbitrary\" specification of many important parameters, including land surface roughness, leaf thickness, and canopy gravimetric water content, due to the lack of available data.\nGiven the poor specification of both the LSM and MEM parameters, here we jointly calibrate the LSMs and MEMs. This is a significant departure from prior related studies calibrating to remote sensing data. In one set of studies [18] , [21] , [23] - [26] , LSMs are calibrated to remote sensing data products (e.g., soil moisture and soil temperature), the generation of which relies on uncalibrated radiative transfer models. In the other batch of studies [27] - [30] , MEMs were calibrated to brightness temperature data products, taking inputs from uncalibrated LSMs. (In some cases, the LSM was not simultaneously calibrated as this would upset model climatology [28] , [29] .) The approach of jointly estimating the LSM and MEM is further motivated by prior studies specifically attributing forward modeling errors to errors in soil moisture dynamic range [27] , [30] . Given this departure from previous studies, we also compare the benefits, if any, of joint calibration over the independent calibration of the LSM or MEM.\nThe forward modeling is conducted using National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC)'s Land Information System (LIS), with the calibration done using the LIS optimization and uncertainty estimation subsystem (LIS-OPT/UE) [31] , [32] . As in several recent studies [28] - [30] , optimal parameter sets are sought for each grid cell (i.e., \"locally\" estimated), and a stochastic search algorithm is applied. This approach is distinct from other studies (e.g., [27] ) in which an ad hoc search was applied to identify a single best global parameter set.\nThe focus here is on assessing calibration's impact on the forward models' predictive ability and not on the evaluation of the physical consistency of the resultant parameter values. The hydrological literature is replete with examples, even in field or finer-scale studies [18] , [23] , [33] - [35] , of calibration leading to significant and important improvements in simulation but resulting in parameter values that are inconsistent with in situ measurement. There are several theoretical reasons for this seeming dissonance, including parameter distortions introduced from the necessary model simplifications [36] , the incompleteness of the error models employed [36] - [40] , and inability to access and tune hard-coded parameters [41] , and an active area of research exists exploring these issues [18] , [40] , [42] - [49] . An additional problem is the lack of in situ data of a spatial sampling density sufficient for comparison to model-scale (here, 0.25\n\u2022 ) estimates [19] . For these reasons, land surface property retrieval is considered beyond the scope of this study.\nAn important caveat of the study is that retrievals of MWE are themselves subject to considerable error. Intercomparisons [3] , [50] , [51] of MWE retrieval products generated by a range of research groups using different and, in some cases, even the same instruments [Special Sensor Microwave/Imager, Thematic Mapper Imager, and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System (AMSR-E)] have revealed significant differences. Even for relatively homogeneous scenes such as desert or rainforest, the mean emissivity at GPM-relevant frequencies can vary up to 0.04 across products [50] , [51] . Likely error sources at lower frequencies include the surface skin temperature not being representative of that of the emitting soil layer [52] - [57] , and at higher frequencies, errors in atmospheric profile data [57] . As such, the error statistics reported here should be viewed more as a test of whether it is viable to bring the model predictions and retrievals into better agreement through the calibration process than as a confirmatory statement on the value of the calibrated forward models. We therefore report on root-mean-square difference (RMSD) rather than on RMSE. An MWE benchmark data set, which is based on in situ measurement, is needed to fully validate the forward models along with the retrievals.\nThe RMSD of MWE forward model estimation at the time of AMSR-E overpasses, approximately 2:00 P.M. and 1:00 A.M. local time in the SGP, is evaluated for the following approaches to MWE estimation: 1) forward modeling without calibration; 2) forward modeling with calibration; 3) 1) and 2), after bias correction; 4) daily climatology (based on MWE retrievals).\nThese results are further broken down by land cover class. Finally, to evaluate the worth of the joint LSM-MEM calibration, the percent change in RMSD is reported for LSM-only calibration and MEM-only calibration."}, {"section_title": "II. METHODS AND DATA", "text": "LIS facilitates studies of the land surface through an objectoriented interoperable high-performance computing software architecture [31] , [32] . The object-oriented design enables the interchange of physical models, meteorological and model parameter data sets, and data assimilation methods. In addition, it supports the coupling of LSMs to a range of models. For example, LSMs can be coupled to meteorological models (e.g., the Weather and Research Forecasting (WRF) system), routing models, radiative transfer models (RTMs), and, as illustrated here, MEMs. Important to this study, LIS also includes an optimization and uncertainty estimation subsystem (LIS-OPT/UE) [18] , [58] , which is used here for the joint LSM-MEM calibration. LIS can be run at a user-designated spatial and temporal resolution. Here, the forward models are run hourly at 0.25\n\u2022 \u00d7 0.25\n\u2022 over the SGP. The overall forward modeling and calibration approach, as implemented within LIS, is depicted in Fig. 1 . Each solid box (e.g., \"LSM\" and \"MEM\") refers to a software abstraction; implementation of the required interfaces associated with an abstraction defines a new instance (e.g., \"Noah\" and \"CRTM\"). The arrows indicate the passing of information between these abstractions. Below, we describe the methods and data in relation to Fig. 1, starting [62] . It is currently employed as the land surface scheme in National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP)'s global and regional operational models, including the Global Forecasting System and the NCEP Weather Research and Forecasting Nonhydrostatic Mesoscale Model. The modeling of soil moisture in the Noah LSM, which has been extensively evaluated [14] , [63] , is handled by a formulation of the Richards' equation governed by the Campbell [64] functions, with the soil profile discretized into four layers in the standard configuration, with a top layer of 10 cm.\nNoah and LSMs, generally, are driven by near-surface atmospheric forcings (e.g., temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation). Here, downward shortwave and longwave radiation, air temperature, specific humidity, wind speed, and surface pressure are obtained from the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS2). NLDAS2 is generally regarded as a high-quality forcing data set for the continental United States as it incorporates data and analysis that are not available in real time (e.g., gauge observations of precipitation, adjustments for topographical influences on precipitation, further quality control checks, and downscaling) [65] . As a result, NLDAS2 can be expected to be of relatively higher quality than forcing data sets with global coverage.\nLSM simulations depend on a wide range of parameters, including radiative parameters (e.g., albedo and emissivity), vegetation parameters (e.g., vegetation fraction, minimum stomatal resistance, and LAI), thermal properties (e.g., quartz content), and soil hydraulic properties (e.g., porosity and hydraulic conductivity). Monthly climatologically derived values of albedo from NCEP are applied. While monthly climatological estimates of green vegetation fraction (gvf ; the Noah variable SHDFAC) are typically used, given the importance of vegetation to the modeling of MWE, the eight-day LAI product from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Collection 5 (MCD15A2.005) [66] is applied, with the raw 1-km data gridded to the 0.25\n\u2022 running resolution. The product is only nominally 8-day as persistent cloud cover can result in interpolation between observations further than eight days apart. To obtain gvf , we apply the conversion of Niu [67] as\nwhere k lai2gvf is 0.52.\nAs noted in Section I, most parameters in Noah (and other LSMs) are typically specified via lookup tables based on soil texture or land cover. Soil texture and vegetative land cover dominant at the 0.25\n\u2022 \u00d7 0.25\n\u2022 running resolution is shown for the SGP (34 Fig. 2 . The soil texture, as well as the underlying sand, clay, and silt fractions that serve as the direct inputs to the models, is drawn from the State Soil Geographic Database (STATSGO) maps [68] . Loams are the major soil texture type: Silt loam (41% of pixels), Sandy loam (21%), followed by Loam (13%), Silty clay loam (13%), and Clay loam (5%). Other less represented soils include Sand (6%), Clay (1%), and Silty clay (0.25%).\nThere is considerable variation in dominant land cover in the SGP (see Fig. 2 , bottom). Of the 13 land cover types in the classification of Hansen et al. [69] , nine are represented. Cropland, which is defined as crops occupying more than 80% of the landscape, is the most prevalent (43% of pixels). As MWE has been shown to be sensitive to crop type [70] , [71] , we note that winter wheat represents approximately a third of all harvested (cultivated and noncultivated) crops in the SGP according to the 2007 Census of Agriculture; west of 97\n\u2022 W, by acreage, it is the predominant crop. Corn, soybeans, and sorghum together represent an additional third, and Hay, which is harvested nearly uniformly in all but the northwestern corner of the SGP, represents the final third. Even where Grassland (22% of pixels) and Wooded Grassland (21%) dominate, Cropland is typically the second dominant land cover class including within the majority of the Grassland pixels shown in Fig. 2 , and, north of 37\n\u2022 N, most of the Wooded Grassland pixels. The remaining land cover in the SGP is Woodland (6%) and Closed Shrubland (5%), and less than 2% each of Evergreen Needleleaf Forest, Deciduous Broadleaf Forest, Mixed Forest, and Urban and Built areas. The two Urban and Built pixels correspond to the cities of Wichita, Kansas and Tulsa, Oklahoma.\nThe LSM-MEM interface (see Fig. 1 ) specifies the mapping of the outputs of the LSM to the inputs of the MEM. At each of the hourly time steps, the LSM passes through or computes the variables needed by the MEM. For example, sand and clay fraction and LAI are passed through to the MEM. Soil moisture and soil temperature and other state variables are computed. The MEM then takes these inputs and generates estimates of MWE for different frequencies and polarizations (SIM in Fig. 1 ) using parameterizations that capture the sensitivity of MWE to soil moisture, the effects of surface roughness, and the scattering effects and emission of vegetation (and snow).\nBoth MEMs were designed for global operations. For computational tractability and in recognition of data limitations, their development invoked lower-order approximations of the radiative transfer equations [72] . For example, over vegetated surfaces, both adopt the \"tau-omega\" model that is limited in its ability to capture multiple scattering and radiometrically important vegetation characteristics (e.g., leaf shape, size, and orientation) [72] - [76] . Several studies [74] , [77] , however, have recognized that despite these simplifications, with adjustments to parameter values, the tau-omega model can often reasonably mimic more complete solutions, for example, with the lowering of albedo to capture the darkening that results from multiple scattering. The identification of these \"effective\" parameter values has been achieved in two ways, either with tuning to a more complete radiative transfer solution [74] or, the approach taken here, with tuning to MWE observations [77] .\nCRTM is one component of a comprehensive modular radiative transfer modeling system developed by National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/NASA/ Department of Defense JCSDA. The version of CRTM used in this study is CRTM REL-2.0.2. CRTM is designed to simulate specific satellite-based sensors and, as such, is equipped to conduct radiative transfer calculations for a broad set of frequencies, including infrared, visible, and microwave. Here, only that portion of CRTM that computes land surface MWE is invoked. The NESDIS_LandEM_Module developed at NOAA's Environmental Satellite and Information Service (NESDIS), which is now referred to as the CRTM Surface Emissivity Model for Microwave (CSEM-MW) [78] , is applied. Land MWE is simulated using a two-stream radiative approximation [15] . Reflection and emission occurring at the interfaces above and below the scattering layer (i.e., vegetation and snow) are incorporated. Cross polarization is expressed as a function of roughness height and frequency [79] . The input vegetation parameters are used to derive the absorption and scattering coefficients, which are then used in the tau-omega model to simulate the effect of vegetation cover [80] . Inputs relevant to snow-free MWE calculation are the satellite zenith angle, MW frequency, soil moisture content, vegetation fraction, soil temperature, and land surface skin temperature. We refer to the forward model approach involving CRTM as Noah-CRTM to make explicit the dependence of the simulated MWE on the LSM.\nThe second MEM, CMEM [16] , [17] , [27] version 3.0, was designed to support radiative transfer calculation at lower microwave frequencies only (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) . In this paper, we present results above 20 GHz, but these should be considered experimental only. CMEM is similar to CRTM in that it contains modules for both surface MWE and atmospheric transfer calculations and essentially relies on the same physical principles for MWE calculation. In contrast, CMEM includes several optional modules for testing alternative empirical relationships and parameterization schemes, for example, for absorption and scattering [16] , [17] . For this study, we have generally followed the choices made by Drusch et al. [27] . As with CRTM, to reflect the dependence on the LSM, we refer to Noah-CMEM (rather than CMEM).\nIn this paper, two choices related to vegetation modeling are made that affect the MEM modeling. First, we introduce a simple coefficient, i.e., WATER_CONTENT_PER_LAI, that recognizes MODIS LAI as a, albeit limited [81] , proxy measure of vegetation water content. Second, for the purpose of MWE estimation, each pixel is considered mixed in a twocomponent scene model, consisting of a bare ground fraction and homogenously vegetated fraction. This strategy, which is similar to that used in the vegetation index/LAI literature [82] , [83] , recognizes the limitations of applying an average LAI value to a pixel due to the nonlinearities in the response of MWE to soil moisture and vegetation. Here, the bare ground fraction consists of a fixed year-round bare ground fraction (bgf fixed ) and, using the Niu [67] relationship (1), a variable bare ground fraction. The vegetated fraction is computed as earlier (1), but applied only to the area that is not permanent bare ground, and therefore with an inflated LAI (factor: 1/(1 \u2212 bgf fixed )). At each time step, the MEM is run twice, i.e., once for the vegetated fraction and once for the bare ground fraction, with appropriate averaging. The motivation for this simplified approach over a more computationally intensive tiling approach is the general recognition of the significant limitations of the data and models and indications that, even at fine scales, the mixed-pixel problem is not avoided [84] .\nThe calibration was conducted with LIS-OPT/UE [18] , [58] . The LIS-OPT/UE subsystem provides a computational infrastructure that facilitates the application of parameter estimation and uncertainty estimation algorithms to land surface and coupled models. Here, we are invoking the LIS-OPT subsystem to conduct parameter estimation. As shown in Fig. 1 , the LIS-OPT Optimization Algorithm guides the search for \"decision variables,\" here the model Parameters, in a direction of improved match of SIM and OBS, where the quality of the match is defined by an Objective Function.\nThe Parameters to be optimized are given in Table I . As noted in Section I, the parameter estimation is conducted \"locally.\" The set of parameters requiring tuning is denoted as \u03b8 i,j , where i and j refer to the row and the column, respectively, of the grid cell within the 0.25\n\u2022 SGP domain. The parameters to be tuned also include k lai2gvf , which determines gvf as a function of LAI [see (1)], and, given its uncertainty and variation by land cover [81] , WATER_CONTENT_PER_LAI that determines vegetation water content.\nThe inclusion of the LSM parameters results in a much larger set of parameters requiring tuning. For comparison, Drusch et al. [27] limited calibration to selection from among three parameterization schemes and adjustment of three CMEM parameters-soil roughness, vegetation structure coefficient, and vegetation water content for dense vegetation. In [28] - [30] , five physical process parameters were tuned: two surfaceroughness-related parameters (describing surface roughness and its angular dependence), two vegetation-structure-related parameters (relating vegetation optical thickness to LAI), and scattering albedo. Still, a greater number of parameters could, in principle, be tuned, leading to a superior calibration, as there are numerous parameters not accessible through toplevel interfaces-a point recently made for LSMs [41] and also certainly the case for MEMs.\nThe OBS in Fig. 1 derive from the SGP cloud-cleared AMSR-E MWE retrievals of Ringerud et al. [2] , the details of which are provided in that study. The retrievals were performed using level-1 C AMSR-E brightness temperatures under \"Confident Clear\" conditions in all 1-km MODIS pixels within the AMSR-E largest footprint. The retrievals also relied on space and time-interpolated ECMWF interim reanalysis (ERAInterim) 3-hourly, 1-degree surface skin temperature, and water vapor. The retrieval scheme involved radiative transfer modeling in an iterative procedure to determine the surface microwave emission best matching predicted and AMSR-Eobserved brightness temperatures.\nWe restrict the observations used in the calibration to lowfrequency channels to avoid the atmospheric contamination errors of the higher frequency channels [50] . Five different sets of low-frequency channels, i.e., C, were tested: (6.925 H), (6.925 V), (6.925 H, 10.65 H), (6.925 V, 6 .925 H), and (10.65 V, 10.65 H). We present only the results of C = (10.65 V, 10.65 H), as the conclusions of this study were insensitive to the selection of calibration channel combination and as (10.65 V, 10.65 H) was a slightly better performer; differences (after bias correction) in RMSD between the channel sets tested were less than 1%. In the validation, the model applies the calibrated parameters to predict at all channels. To improve the quality of the calibration data set, the retrievals were processed beyond that done by Ringerud et al. [2] . For each overpass, the retrievals were geolocated into the grid cells based on the lat/lon center points. If there were at least five retrievals falling within the 0.25\n\u2022 grid cell for that overpass, then the retrieved MWE was averaged to obtain the grid cell estimate; otherwise, the average was presumed to lack sufficient accuracy for the purposeof calibration (and validation).\nIn addition, as the scope of this study was restricted to the MWE dynamics of the soil-vegetation system, if at the time of overpass, any of the models indicated a land surface or soil temperature below 275 K, or snow, the retrieval was excluded. The number of retrievals greatly varied within the year, and from year to year, with far fewer retrievals in the months of December through February due to the cloud masking and conservative masking for frozen ground and snow. [26] , [85] . Calibration was restricted to the warm season to avoid frozen soil and snow. For the grid cell at row i and column j, we refer to the retrieval for channel c at model time step t as y t,c,i,j . The full set of time steps of retrievals, which correspond to the cloud-cleared snow-and frozen-ground-free descending and ascending overpasses, for the calibration period is referred to as T and, as previously mentioned, the full set of channels calibrated to as C, with C = (10.65 V, 10.65 H). The forward-model-simulated emissivities (SIM in Fig. 1 ) using trial parameter set \u03b8 i,j are denoted by \u03b5 t,c,i,j (\u03b8 i,j ).\nAs in other LSM and MEM calibration studies [23] - [25] , [86] , the familiar least squares Objective Function is applied. The following problem was solved for each grid cell:\nEach channel c in C was equally weighted, i.e., w c = 1. The resulting least squares solution can be viewed as a maximumlikelihood solution if the residuals \u03b5 t,c,i,j (\u03b8 i,j ) \u2212 y t,c,i,,j can be described by an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) normal error model [87] . A genetic algorithm was selected as the Optimization Algorithm to solve the above optimization problem (2) . Genetic algorithms are stochastic global search algorithms that draw on concepts from evolutionary search, mimicking the process of natural selection [88] . They are particularly suited to challenging problems such as parameter estimation in which the objective function response surface may not be smooth and may have multiple local optima, which are properties that can confound deterministic (e.g., gradient-based) search algorithms. The genetic algorithm within LIS is described in detail in the work of Kumar [58] . The particular configuration used here relies on a population size of 20, a mutation rate of 2%, 90% crossover rate, elitism, and a two-point crossover scheme.\nIn all calibration (and default) runs, the Noah LSM was run over a two-year spin-up period to obtain the land surface states (e.g., soil moisture and soil temperature) just prior to the calibration period. The spin-up is a typical land surface modeling practice that allows for the land surface states at the beginning of the period of interest to become independent of the guess states at the start of the spin-up period. The additional two years of simulation greatly adds to the computation time but is necessary as the spun-up initial land surface states are impacted by changes to the parameters (e.g., maximum soil moisture).\nAfter finding the genetic algorithm solutions to (2), the models are run over the validation period using the \"optimal\" parameter values \u03b8 i,j * . The approximately seven-year validation period consists of the AMSR-E period of record less the twoyear spin-up and six-month calibration period.\nThe daily climatological estimates, which provide an additional point of reference, were developed in the following way. For each grid cell and AMSR-E channel, climatological monthly means were computed using retrievals developed over the AMSR-E record. Daily estimates were arrived at by interpolating between the climatological monthly means, each pinned to the 15th day of the month."}, {"section_title": "III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION", "text": "Here, the forward model performance over the seven-year validation period is discussed. RMSD is the metric selected to evaluate consistency with the AMSR-E retrievals. For readability, in the tables and text, RMSD * 100 is reported. In Table II , RMSD * 100 was computed for each frequency, for both the calibrated and uncalibrated models. To differentiate results in the figures and text when discussing the calibrated models, we append \"C-\" to the model name, e.g., C-Noah-CRTM and C-Noah-CMEM. Moreover, given atmospheric contamination in retrievals particularly at 89 V and 89 H, averages including and excluding 89 are supplied.\nFirst, we consider the RMSD of Noah-CRTM and Noah-CMEM prior to calibration. Neither Noah-CRTM nor Noah-CMEM outperform climatology. Noah-CRTM is more consistent with retrievals than Noah-CMEM. As averaged across all channels, RMSD * 100 computed for Noah-CRTM was 2.4, which is more than 40% less than that of Noah-CMEM, i.e., 4.2. The maximum RMSD across channels was 3.4 for Noah-CRTM as compared with 6.0 for Noah-CMEM. The finding of a lack of agreement with retrievals is consistent with prior studies [2] , [50] .\nAfter calibration, the model estimates are much more consistent with the retrievals, with C-Noah-CRTM resulting in lower RMSD. C-Noah-CRTM achieves an RMSD * 100 of 2.2, whereas that of C-Noah-CMEM remains higher, i.e., 2.9. The improvement in RMSD from calibration is considerable. The extent of improvement was slighter for C-Noah-CRTM, with RMSD * 100 decreasing from 2.4 to 2.2, as compared with C-Noah-CMEM, which decreased from 4.2 to 2.9. Excluding 89 from results, C-Noah-CRTM estimates remain more Fig. 3 . Estimated pdfs for 10.65-GHz horizontal-polarization emissivity across the SGP, for the forward models (uncalibrated and calibrated) and retrievals. As compared with the retrievals, Noah-CMEM has much lower emissivities, whereas Noah-CRTM has a narrower dynamic range. The calibrated models, i.e., C-Noah-CRTM and C-Noah-CMEM, are more in line with the retrievals, but the dynamic range remains too narrow by comparison.\nconsistent with the retrievals, with an average RMSD * 100 of 1.8, as compared with C-Noah-CMEM's 2.1. However, only at 10.65 H do C-Noah-CRTM and C-Noah-CMEM outperform climatology.\nThe high average RMSD of C-Noah-CMEM is a result of performance at the higher frequency channels, with C-Noah-CMEM quickly degrading to 3.7 at 36.5 H and 6.0 at 89.0 H. This is perhaps a result of CMEM's design focus on frequencies only up to 20 GHz. At the lower-frequency channels, i.e., 10.65-18.7, C-Noah-CMEM generally outperformed C-Noah-CRTM.\nAt the lower frequencies, calibration had the effect of removing the large emissivity simulation differences between the models. This is nicely summarized by the plot (see Fig. 3 ) of the probability density functions (pdfs) of 10.65-GHz horizontalpolarization MWE for the uncalibrated and calibrated models, which were generated using all points in the domain. Noah-CMEM systematically simulated emissivities much lower than Noah-CRTM. These differences are mostly erased with calibration, with the mode of C-Noah-CMEM only slightly lower, i.e., by about 0.01 emissivity, than that of C-Noah-CMEM and with virtually no differences at the low-emissivity end of the pdf.\nFurthermore, shown in Fig. 3 are the pdfs for the retrievals at 10.65-GHz horizontal polarization. Against the retrievals, uncalibrated Noah-CRTM has a somewhat narrower dynamic range in MWE. Uncalibrated Noah-CMEM emissivities are markedly different, with simulated MWE much lower than the retrievals, which explains the large RMSD. In postcalibration, both models are more consistent with the retrievals, although their dynamic range is clearly narrower than that of the retrievals.\nA number of factors may be contributing to the narrower dynamic range of the model emissivity postcalibration. Errors in the emissivity retrievals themselves stemming from incorrect values of surface temperature are one source [3] , [50] , [51] , [53] . The surface temperatures used in the retrievals will depart from the effective temperature of the emitting soil layer at 10.65 GHz at the AMSR-E overpass times (about 2:00 P.M. and 1:00 A.M. local in the SGP) and, particularly, at the time of the afternoon overpass [89] . In addition, the dependence of Fig. 4 . Estimated pdfs for soil moisture across the SGP, prior to and after calibration. Calibration to the emissivity retrievals shifts soil moisture to a much drier state, more so for C-Noah-CMEM than C-Noah-CRTM.\nthe effective depth of the emitting soil layer on soil moisture is a complicating factor.\nThe narrower pdf may also reflect inadequate physics for the LSM or MEM. For example, LSMs, including Noah version 3.3, lack the ability to capture inundation, which has the effect of greatly reducing emissivity and increasing polarization. Within the calibration period, there was extreme precipitation from September 11-15, 2008 from a continental-type storm event (12-in rain in some parts of Kansas) followed by the remnants of a hurricane [90] . Moreover, within the validation period, specific locations experienced serious flooding on April 28, 2009 . The retrieved microwave polarization difference index and emissivities at these points and times were consistent with inundation [91] , [92] . To fully explore the effects of inundation on the calibration, ancillary data sets (e.g., scatterometer) would be needed as passive microwave alone is not sufficient to indicate flooding, as different mixed scenes of open water and wet soils present similar MWE signatures [91] , [93] , [94] .\nMoreover, limitations in the MEM physics may be a contributing factor. For example, CRTM and CMEM apply the same roughness value to all frequencies and polarizations. Several studies have investigated roughness parameterizations that have frequency dependence [95] and that also introduce dependence on soil moisture [96] - [98] . In addition, the models do not account for phenomena such as dew or intercepted water, both of which can exert influence over emissivity, including, it is thought, in the SGP [99] . To improve the models, these issues need further exploration.\nThe calibration moved both models toward a generally drier state to increase MWE sensitivity to soil moisture changes. MWE is more responsive to the addition of water to dry soils rather than wet soils. PDFs for soil moisture (see Fig. 4 ) illustrate the drying out. The pdfs were generated for the domain, both before and after calibration, using all points in the SGP. Calibration had the effect of shifting both models' estimates of soil moisture toward a generally drier state. The pdf mode of C-Noah-CRTM and C-Noah-CMEM, respectively, was approximately two thirds and one third that of Noah left uncalibrated. While this change in soil moisture is large, it is well within the range of biases reported for Noah and other LSMs, including in the SGP (e.g., [14] ). The validity of both C-Noah-CRTM and C-Noah-CMEM soil moisture estimates across the SGP is generally unknown. The soil moisture estimates were not compared with products based on AMSR-E or other passive microwave instruments as these products cannot be considered independent as they, too, rely on similar modeling (typically without calibration). One of the few grid cells for which spatially averaged in situ soil moisture data are believed to be fairly representative is for the single grid cell (34.875 \u2022 N, 98.125\n\u2022 W) that corresponds to the USDA Agricultural Research Service (ARS) Little Washita River Experimental Watershed [55] , [100] , [101] . The grid cell encompasses a large fraction of the experimental watershed. Land cover consists of pasture and rangeland and winter wheat. The soil moisture time series (see Fig. 5 ) illustrates that the drying out brought about by calibration is warranted, as the in situ data are much drier than Noah left uncalibrated. In addition, the time series indicates differences in dynamic range and rate of dry-down for the calibrated models-behaviors that were seen in many such time series across the SGP that we plotted. C-Noah-CMEM exhibits a wider dynamic range and faster dry-down than C-Noah-CRTM, which appears more consistent with the in situ data. However, both models continue to exhibit a wet bias with respect to the in situ data.\nThe adjustment in the models' simulation of soil moisture was accompanied by simultaneous changes in the sensitivity to LAI. Differences between the calibrated models are evident when examining MWE as a function of soil moisture and LAI. The average MWE for bins of soil moisture and LAI are shown in Fig. 6 for 10 .65 H, for the uncalibrated models [see Fig. 6(a)  and (b) ] and the calibrated models [see Fig. 6(d) and (e)] . If the models were to exhibit the same behaviors, we would expect the plots to be very similar. However, referring to Fig. 6(d)   Fig. 6 . 10.65-GHz horizontal-polarization emissivity for bins of soil moisture and LAI, for the (a) and (b) models and (c) retrievals prior to calibration and for the (d) and (e) models and (f) and (g) retrievals after calibration. Axes are as labeled in (c). Soil moisture (x-axis) is as estimated by (a)-(c) Noah, (d) and (f) C-Noah-CRTM, and (e) and (g) C-Noah-CMEM.\nand (e), at high values of soil moisture and at LAI around 3, the MWE response is markedly different. In this region, in these average terms, C-Noah-CRTM shows MWE sensitivity to soil moisture, whereas C-Noah-CMEM does not. A caveat of these MWE-soil moisture-LAI plots is that they indicate only average MWE, lumping together many different SGP locations, each of which has its own optimal parameter set and, therefore, unique MWE-soil moisture-LAI relationship, and which generally occupies only a portion of the soil moisture-LAI space shown . TABLE III  SAME AS TABLE II, BUT AFTER BIAS CORRECTION. AFTER BIAS CORRECTION, THE CALIBRATED FORWARD  MODELS IMPROVE UPON CLIMATOLOGY BY AN AVERAGE OF 19% (25% IF EXCLUDING 89 GHz) Moreover, in Fig. 6 , the MWE-soil moisture-LAI plots are shown for the retrievals. Prior to calibration, the plots for both models [see Fig. 6(a) and (b) ] are quite different as compared with the retrievals [see Fig. 6(c) ]. For the case after calibration, two plots are needed to show the retrievals' sensitivity to soil moisture and LAI, as the calibration affects the soil moisture modeling on the x-axis. By comparing each model's plot with the respective retrieval plots [i.e., Fig. 6 (d) with (f) and (e) with (g)], two observations can be made. First, the distinct patterns seen for each model are largely replicated in each corresponding retrieval plot. As a consequence, absent other information, no one model appears more consistent with the retrievals than the other at 10.65 H. Second, in comparison to the retrievals, both tend to overestimate MWE in very dry conditions and exhibit too little soil moisture sensitivity at values of LAI near 1 and below. The overly high MWE in dry conditions is more evident with C-Noah-CRTM than C-Noah-CMEM, whereas the low sensitivity to soil moisture at low LAI is more evident with C-Noah-CMEM. It is not clear why. The general appearance of the plots for C-Noah-CMEM appears consistent with that of [13] , which, while showing vegetative water content in place of LAI, indicates little emissivity sensitivity to soil moisture at all, but the lowest, levels of vegetation.\nNext, we applied a simple bias correction to the model estimates. This was motivated by the earlier observation of the smaller dynamic range as compared with retrievals (see Fig. 3 ) and by having observed significant anomaly correlations (not shown) in the Cropland and Grassland land cover classes. For each grid cell, month, and channel, linear regression was applied with the retrievals as the dependent variable and model estimate as the independent variable. To put on an equal footing with climatology, the full set of observations used in the development of the climatological estimates was used in the linear regression. By doing so, this approach also partially addresses any systematic biases in the retrievals themselves (e.g., surface temperature and emitting-layer temperature mismatch at lower frequencies and atmospheric contamination at higher frequencies).\nThe results (see Table III ) indicate that use of the models would improve upon climatology to a significant degree. Even if left uncalibrated, once bias corrected, there is improvement. The across-channel average RMSD * 100 for Noah-CRTM and Noah-CMEM, respectively, is 1.40 and 1.42-a 14% and 13% reduction from that of climatology (excluding 89 GHz: 17% and 14%). Calibration leads to further improvements. The across-channel average RMSD * 100 was 1.36 and 1.32 for C-Noah-CRTM and C-Noah-CMEM-a 17% and 19% reduction from climatology (excluding 89 GHz: 21% and 25%).\nThus, incorporating calibrated forward model estimates of the dynamics of MWE, after correcting for systematic biases through linear regression, can result in an approximately 20% channel average reduction in RMSD as compared with reliance on climatology.\nIn Table IV , we show RMSD for bias-corrected C-Noah-CRTM and C-Noah-CMEM by land cover class. C-Noah-CRTM and C-Noah-CMEM are in general agreement. Evergreen Needleleaf Forest has the lowest RMSD * 100, i.e., 1.02 and 1.01, respectively, for C-Noah-CRTM and C-Noah-CMEM (excluding 89 GHz: 0.72 and 0.71). Cropland, which is the predominant land cover class in the SGP, has the highest RMSD * 100, i.e., 1.44 and 1.39 (excluding 89 GHz: 1.24 and 1.19). Overall, the models, once calibrated and after addressing the bias, are very similar and appear almost interchangeable.\nThe percentage change in RMSD from climatology is also listed in Table IV . For forested land cover (Evergreen Needleleaf Forest, Deciduous Broadleaf Forest, Mixed Forest, and Woodland), the reduction is small-less than 10%. This is followed by Wooded Grassland, Closed Shrubland, Grassland, and Cropland. The percentage reduction from climatology is smaller for Noah-CRTM than for Noah-CMEM for these classes. For Cropland, RMSD is reduced by 20% and 23% for Noah-CRTM and Noah-CMEM, respectively (excluding 89 GHz: 26% and 29%). For the Urban and Built land cover class, calibration reduces RMSD by about 10% from climatology.\nWe then explore the losses, if any, of calibrating only the LSM or only the MEM. As mentioned in Section I, for understandable reasons, e.g., so as not to upset the LSM climatology given the range of uses of the models, typically, the MEM alone has been calibrated with the LSM left unchanged, e.g., [28] and [29] . The risk of restricting the calibration only to the MEM is that the issue with soil moisture dynamic range that was identified in [27] and [30] is left un-addressed. It is therefore important to know the extent of any potential gains of joint calibration, which we briefly address here.\nIn Table V , for each model, the change in RMSD is shown when calibrating only the LSM or only the MEM. With the exception of 89.0 V/H, RMSD is higher if not performing joint calibration. Excluding 89.0 V/H, for C-Noah-CRTM, RMSD is as much as 10% higher and, for C-Noah-CMEM, as much as 22% higher. For C-Noah-CRTM and C-Noah-CMEM, respectively, the increase in the average RMSD (excluding 89 GHz) is 2.3% and 2.7% for LSM-only calibration and 5.5% and 12% for MEM-only calibration. This would suggest that for MWE estimation, it is more important to calibrate the LSM than the MEM. For these results, the bias-corrected model estimates were used. Absent bias correction, the results (not shown) are similar but amplified, with the percentage change in RMSD at lower-frequency channels significantly higher."}, {"section_title": "IV. CONCLUSION", "text": "Improving the accuracy of forward-model-simulated land MWE would be beneficial, as retrieving precipitation over land requires removal of the land background signal. Prior studies, however, have highlighted the limited predictive power of forward models for MWE estimation. This paper has evaluated the potential for improving forward modeling through calibration to address the problem of poor model parameter specification.\nThe goal of the calibration exercise was to maximize the closeness of forward model predictions of MWE with retrieved estimates of emissivity during snow-free unfrozen conditions. The domain selected was the SGP. CRTM (version 2.0.2) and CMEM (version 3.0), two MEMs, both taking inputs from the Noah LSM (version 3.3), formed the two basic model configurations that were subjected to the calibration. AMSR-E cloud-cleared retrievals for channels very similar to those of GPM were used for calibration and validation. An optimization method (genetic algorithm) was applied to search for the values of 35 land surface and MEM parameters minimizing the familiar \"least squares\" criterion.\nCalibration improved the agreement of the forward model and retrieved estimates of MWE. The calibration of Noah-CRTM and Noah-CMEM resulted in drier soil moisture states being simulated (more so for Noah-CMEM) and with simultaneous adjustments to vegetation sensitivity. Calibrated Noah-CMEM resulted in a better match to the retrievals at lower-frequency channels than Noah-CRTM (RMSD as averaged over 10.65-and 18.7-GHz channels, V and H polarizations: Noah-CRTM, 0.0089; Noah-CMEM = 0.0087), but a worse match overall due to high RMSD at high-frequency channels (RMSD as averaged over all channels: Noah-CRTM, 0.022; Noah-CMEM = 0.029), although it is important to note that CMEM is designed only up to 20 GHz. A systematic bias of the calibrated forward models was observed, specifically a distinctly narrower dynamic range than the retrievals. Possible explanations include surface temperature errors in the retrievals, a lack of an inundation modeling ability in LSMs, and limitations in the models' roughness parameterization schemes.\nA bias correction scheme was applied to the model estimates, as would be done if implementing the models in operations. This led to a much better match to retrieved emissivities. The average RMSD for both forward models was just over 0.013, which, compared with the before-bias-correction scenario, represents a one-third and one-half reduction for Noah-CRTM and Noah-CMEM, respectively. This also represents an approximate 10% improvement over the models when left uncalibrated but bias corrected.\nUse of the forward models to capture the dynamics of emissivity can lead to improvements over reliance on daily climatology (as interpolated from monthly emissivity climatology). In average terms, the models achieve an approximate 20% reduction in RMSD over climatology.\nThe improvements in RMSD from calibration differed by land cover. RMSD (after bias correction) was least for forested areas in absolute terms (0.010) and in percentage reduction from climatology (< 10%). RMSD was highest for grasslands and cropland in absolute terms (0.014) and percentage improvement (near 20%).\nNumerous calibration exercises were performed. Joint calibration of the LSM and MEM was found to result in lower RMSD than calibrating only the MEM, which was the approach taken in previous related calibration studies. The calibration of the MEM alone resulted in RMSD that was 6% and 12% higher than the joint calibration for Noah-CRTM and Noah-CMEM, respectively. LSM-only calibration resulted in approximately 2% higher RMSD for both models. In another calibration exercise, the study conclusions were found to be insensitive to the choice between five different channel combinations against which to calibrate (bias-corrected RMSD < 1% difference). Calibration to 10.65-GHz V and H polarizations, equally weighted, proved adequate.\nThe validation of the calibrated forward models depends on high-quality calibration data sets. A sound in situ-based emissivity data set would help in discerning the source of discrepancies between the forward models and retrievals, both of which are subject to error. The availability of sound data sets would also help in guiding model development.\nWith further development, the forward models, with their ability to capture the dynamics in MWE, could improve the accuracy of overland precipitation retrievals in the GPM era. However, further studies are needed to quantify the impact of improved emissivity estimation on precipitation retrieval accuracy and, ultimately, on the applications (e.g., water budgets, flooding, drought, and landslide assessment) that rely on precipitation retrievals.
