[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract-The identification and characterization of regional body tissues is essential to understand changes that occur with aging and age-related metabolic diseases such as diabetes and obesity and how these diseases affect trajectories of health and functional status. Imaging technologies are frequently used to derive volumetric, area, and density measurements of different tissues. Despite the significance and direct applicability of automated tissue quantification and characterization techniques, these topics have remained relatively underexplored in the medical image analysis literature. We present a method for identification and characterization of muscle and adipose tissue in the midthigh region using MRI. We propose an image-based muscle quality prediction technique that estimates tissue-specific probability density models and their eigenstructures in the joint domain of water-and fat-suppressed voxel signal intensities along with volumetric and intensity-based tissue characteristics computed during the quantification stage. We evaluated the predictive capability of our approach against reference biomechanical muscle quality (MQ) measurements using statistical tests and classification performance experiments.

INTRODUCTION", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "C", "text": "HANGES in body composition occur in all aging individuals and have profound influences on risk for diseases and decline of physical function. Assessment of body composition is critical in the study of age-related and metabolic diseases [1] , [2] . Loss in muscle strength and mass associated with agingtermed as sarcopenia-is a correlate of poor function and a risk factor for limited mobility. This pathological condition has important health and economic implications. In the East Boston cohort of the Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly, it was observed that 38% of the men and 59% of the women over 65 years of age had difficulty stooping, and 24% of men and 29% of the women had difficulty lifting their arm over the shoulder height [3] . It is estimated that a large portion of such disability is attributed to muscle impairment. Direct healthcare costs due to sarcopenia in the U.S. in 2000 were estimated to exceed $18.5 billion dollars [4] . It has been shown that age-related loss in muscle strength is caused in part by a decline in muscle mass [5] . However, it is becoming clear that decline in muscle strength that occurs with aging is much larger than what would be expected by changes in muscle mass alone [6] . To explain this discrepancy, investigators have explored the relationship between skeletal muscle composition and structure, and functional measures of muscle strength. For example, it is widely acknowledged that fat infiltration in the muscle may contribute to muscle weakness, metabolic diseases and frailty [7] . Therefore, image analysis techniques that could capture tissue characteristics associated with muscle quality (MQ) are attracting considerable interest. Medical imaging technologies provide a noninvasive and accurate means for body composition assessment. The more frequently utilized imaging modalities in related clinical studies are computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging [1] , [8] - [11] . MR imaging can distinguish different types of soft tissue, especially if tissue-selective imaging techniques are used [8] , [12] . CT has also been used to characterize MQ as a correlate to muscle strength [1] , [13] mainly because the voxel intensities are measured in the standardized Hounsfield unit scale and due to the relatively fast image acquisition speed. Despite the increasing interest in assessment of MQ by medical imaging, the specific literature on this topic is limited. Most of the published studies have employed supervised workflows, including manual segmentation and selection of regions-of-interest (ROIs), to quantify tissue volumes and tissue intensity averages. More importantly, there have been, to the best of our knowledge, no previous reports on automated muscle characterization with MRI.\nIn this report, we propose a method for assessment of MQ from tissue-selective MRI. This method is applied to volumetric nonsuppressed (NS), water-suppressed (WS) and fat-suppressed (FS) images acquired at the midthigh level. An example of our data is displayed in Fig. 1 . Tissue segmentation follows the main stages of the method proposed in [11] . After the segmentation of subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and bone, we estimated muscle and intermuscular adipose tissue (IMAT) normal density models in the joint domain of WS and FS voxel intensities, and produced a MQ descriptor using subspace decomposition of muscle and statistical measures of variability. Our premise is that this set of features can be used to assess MQ. Here, we test the method in its ability to discriminate between individuals with high and low MQ. The reference standard for MQ is a functional measure defined as the ratio of muscle strength to muscle mass. Our experiments suggest that the proposed descriptor extracts information that is relevant for prediction of MQ."}, {"section_title": "II. TISSUE IDENTIFICATION", "text": "The objective of this stage is to identify regional adipose tissue, muscle, and bone compartments as seen in Fig. 2 and to extract information related to the volume of different tissues and their distribution of intensities.\nIn the first stage, we identified the midthigh ROI along the superior-inferior axis to restrict our analysis within the anatomical site of interest. We then applied the N4ITK inhomogeneity correction algorithm [14] on the set of non-, water-and fat-suppressed images. This algorithm reduces the low-frequency intensity nonuniformity, or bias, that is present in MRI data and is more pronounced for scanners with higher B 0 field, such as 3 T and above. In this method, authors first assumed an image formation model with multiplicative bias field of the form v(\u03c9) = u(\u03c9)f (\u03c9), where v is the acquired image, u is the ideal image, f is the bias field, and \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9 is the vector of spatial coordinates for an\nThe objective is to restore the original image\u00fb(\u03c9) =v(\u03c9) \u2212f (\u03c9). A numerical solution is found in an iterative scheme\u00fb n = v n \u22121 \u2212f r e at the nth iteration. The residual bias fieldf r e is approximated using B-splines S * {} in multiple resolutions b\u0177 f r e = S * {\u00fb n \u22121 \u2212 E \u00fb |\u00fb n \u22121 }. Next, we linearly coregistered the FS and WS images into the NS spatial domain to correct for possible subject motion using the method proposed in [15] . Because the optimization functions in image registration are in general nonconvex, the authors proposed cost function apodization and a global-local optimization method. We used mutual information-based cost function to address multimodal variations. After the coregistration, we applied linear intensity transformations to standardize the MR intensity dynamic range and reduce the intersubject variability. We identified the fat region using centroid clustering [16] on the NS volumetric image and used the average fat intensities of NS, FS, and WS volumes as reference values to linearly scale the voxel intensities and standardize their dynamic range. Our hypothesis is that the fat tissue intensities are mostly dominated by the subcutaneous fat, whose MR intensity values are largely invariant to the physiological factors, therefore, can be used as a reference point to define linear intensity transformations.\nAfter selecting one leg using the spatial image coordinates, we used parametric active contour models to extract the subcutaneous fat of the selected leg in the nonsuppressed image. In short, these physics-based models [17] guide the deformation of a parametric contour toward the boundary between the subcutaneous fat and the muscle under the influence of imagebased, internal and external forces seeking energy minimization. The authors in [17] defined an energy functional of the form\n2 is the image spatial domain. The image-based energy E im is computed from the image gradient magnitude so that the snake is attracted to image edges, hence\nwhere G \u03c3 denotes a Gaussian kernel with \u03c3 standard deviation. The internal energy E int penalizes stretching and bending,\n, where \u03b1, \u03b2 are the penalty weights. We used a balloon external force E ext to guide the snake from the internal SAT surface to its muscle interface. The minimizing snake is the solution of the Euler equation that is found numerically using a discrete system [17] . Here, we implemented active contour segmentation in a multiscale hierarchical scheme. That is, starting from a coarser scale an approximate solution is found that is used as initial condition for finer scale segmentation. Following this strategy, we achieved faster convergence. Next, we removed the bone region as follows: we first applied multiple Otsu thresholding to identify the air, fat, and muscle groups on the nonsuppressed image, and then, ranked the regions according to their circularity to select the bone marrow. Finally, we used morphological operations with adaptive recursion to label voxels previously unclassified due to the partial volume effect between bone marrow and cortical bone as cortical bone."}, {"section_title": "III. TISSUE DISTRIBUTION MODELS", "text": "We hypothesize that statistical models of MR muscle and IMAT voxel intensity distributions can define a predictive descriptor of fatty infiltration in skeletal muscle. We first modeled the joint WS and FS intensities by a two-component Gaussian mixture model (GMM) corresponding to muscle and IMAT. We then computed the eigenstructure of joint water-and fat-suppressed signal intensity distributions from MRI data. The parametric probability models together with the computed eigenvectors and eigenvalues define a multiparametric descriptor of fat infiltration in midthigh muscle.\nThe normal density parametric model of a voxel intensity sample X in the joint intensity domain [FS, WS] for each tissue type denoted by N tissue is defined as\nwhere tissue \u2208 T = {muscle, IMAT}, \u03c9 tissue denotes each tis-\nThe muscle and IMAT distributions produce the observed Gaussian mixture\nWe used the Expectation-Maximization (E-M) algorithm to fit the Gaussian mixture model and find N tissue (X|\u03c9 tissue , M tissue , C tissue ) and a tissue \u2200 tissue \u2208 T . We note that a tissue = P (\u03c9 tissue ), where P (\u03c9 tissue ) denotes the prior probability of each tissue. Given the tissue density models N tissue and priors P (\u03c9 tissue ) we classified each voxel into the IMAT or muscle group using the likelihood ratio-based discriminant function\nP (\u03c9 muscle ) according to the Bayesian framework. The estimated tissue distribution models correspond to ellipsoids in the 2-D sample domain.\nIn the next step, we aim to obtain a transformed feature space in which to define measures of compactness of computed tissue distribution models under the hypothesis that the dispersion of samples is caused by fat infiltration into the muscle. A solution in the least-square sense is obtained by finding the unit vectors u tissue that maximize u T tissue C tissue u tissue , subject to the constraint ||u tissue || = 1 [16] with tissue \u2208 T = {muscle, IMAT}. Using Lagrangian multiplier optimization, with \u03bb tissue being the undetermined multiplier, we seek to optimize\nBy setting \u2202 L \u2202 u t is s u e = 0, we arrive at the eigenvalue problem\nAfter solving (4), the covariance matrices C tissue of muscle and IMAT can be factored as Fig. 3 helps to explain the rationale behind the proposed tissue distribution modeling. This figure illustrates the tissue intensity distributions of three thigh MRI samples corresponding to low, medium, and high MQ reference measurements computed as the ratio of muscle strength to muscle volume. Muscle strength is a functional variable obtained by isokinetic dynamometry and muscle volume is computed from supervised muscle delineation and anthropometric measures as explained in the experiments section. We display the scatterplots of labeled muscle and IMAT samples after E-M clustering in the joint domain of WS and FS image intensities, the corresponding tissue distribution models, and the scatterplot of the muscle samples overlaid on the muscle distribution model using an enlarged vertical and horizontal scale for visualization purposes.\nWe draw three central conclusions from this analysis. First, we note that the lengths of both principal axes increase with decreasing MQ. We attribute this to the infiltration of skeletal muscle with fat-a major contributor to MQ decline-that increases the inhomogeneity of muscle intensity distribution. If a larger proportion of muscle mass is fat, then a lower proportion of the mass consists of contractile proteins, which explains the low MQ. Second, the orientation of principal axes differs somewhat between the different levels of MQ because of varying correlation between the sample components (sometimes caused by intensity inhomogeneities or other quality artifacts), so it may be beneficial to identify the dispersion along principal axes rather than in the original domain of FS and WS intensities. Equivalently, this method performs decomposition of the voxel intensities into subspaces of reduced intervariable correlation, thus producing more accurate estimation. Third, this approach is amenable to MRI analysis because it computes relative distances in the feature space of standardized intensities as described in Section II. This representation is therefore not dependent on the absolute MRI voxel intensities, which may vary between different scans."}, {"section_title": "IV. TISSUE CHARACTERIZATION", "text": "In this stage, we developed a machine learning system to classify subjects into high and low MQ based on MRI-derived features produced by the tissue quantification and distribution modeling stages.\nOur technique produced the following features; 1) tissue distribution model parameters including the means, covariances, and eigenspace parameters of muscle and intermuscular adipose tissue described in Section III, 2) {NS, FS, WS} scaled intensity means as described in Section II, computed over the muscle, subcutaneous fat, intermuscular adipose tissue, and bone regions, and 3) average areas over the ROI, and area fraction measurements of the muscle, subcutaneous fat, intermuscular adipose tissue, and bone. The resulting dimensionality of the joint domain is 40. The complete list of features can be found in Appendix A.\nStarting with the full feature domain, we applied a dimensionality reduction stage. We first implemented a Fisher's distance ranking-based feature selection approach that we denote by FDR. This method computes the Fisher's distance (or F-score) for each feature. Greater distances correspond to features that produce increased separation; therefore, we next sorted distances in descending order and selected the highest scores according to a user-defined threshold. In addition, we employed the hierarchical dimensionality reduction technique [16] denoted by HDR. This method computes the correlation between all feature pairs and iteratively merges the pair of maximum correlation, thus reducing redundancy in the feature space. Both FDR and HDR can be considered correlation-based methods, but FDR selects the more discriminant features after univariate tests, whereas HDR reduces the redundancy by removing features that are very highly correlated with other features in our space. The third approach that we utilized was the minimum redundancy-maximum relevance (MRMR) feature selection method [18] . This method uses mutual information to measure the entropy produced by each feature set and appropriately selects the set of features that minimizes the redundancy and maximizes the relevance.\nWe utilized support vector machines [19] to build our classification models. Our decision was mainly driven by the wide applicability and good performance of support vector machines in variable classification problems. We tested the hypothesis that our image-based analysis can characterize MQ by cross validation of our classifier against labeled samples of high and low MQ."}, {"section_title": "V. EXPERIMENTS AND DISCUSSION", "text": "We validated the performance of our descriptor against reference biomechanical MQ measurements computed from clinical variables collected in the same study. Maximum quadriceps muscle strength was defined as the highest value of torque from the left leg in up to three consecutive measures of concentric knee extensor strength at an angular velocity of 0.52 rad/s using an isokinetic dynamometer (Kin-Com model 125E, ver. 3.2; Chattanooga Group, Chattanooga, TN, USA). Cross-sectional thigh muscle area was measured from midthigh CT slices with 10-mm slice thickness acquired on a Somatom CT scanner (Somatom Sensation 10; Siemens, Malvern, PA, USA), and quantified using a supervised quantification workflow (Geanie software, ver. 2.1; BonAlyze, Jyvaskyla, Finland). The MQ measure was defined as MQ = T KE CSA MTM \u00b7H , where T KE is the knee extensor torque, CSA MTM is the midthigh muscle cross-sectional area, and H is the participant's height [2] .\nTo determine a threshold for separating the subjects between low and high MQ, we first divided the MQ range of our measurements into 100 intervals, trained and tested our classifier using the complete set of features in a repeated tenfold crossvalidation experiment, and plotted the true positive rate (TPR) and true negative rate (TNR) for each MQ value as displayed in Fig. 4 . We then selected as threshold between the low and high MQ subjects the point of intersection between TPR and TNR for minimal classification error. The resulting threshold is 63.1 (N \u00b7 m/cm 3 ). We performed tissue quantification over a subset of MRI data acquired on an Achieva 3T scanner (Philips Healthcare, Best, The Netherlands) for the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, which is an ongoing, prospective study of longitudinal physical and cognitive changes associated with aging and agerelated diseases [20] . Three scans were acquired sequentially using a 3-D multislice FFE pulse sequence, with parameters: repetition delay T R = 25 ms, echo time T E = 3.8 ms, and flip angle 25\n\u2022 . The first scan was acquired without fat or water suppression while the second and third scans were acquired with water-and fat suppression, respectively, using the selective pulse inversion recovery technique provided on the Philips platform. The entire thigh region was imaged with 80 5-mm-thick slices with in-plane resolution of 0.98 \u00d7 0.98 mm 2 and the field of view was 440 mm \u00d7 300 mm \u00d7 400 mm. The participants remained at rest before and during MRI acquisition according to the imaging protocol.\nIn our experiments, we defined cube-shaped ROIs with the same orientation as the volumetric MRI. The ROI centerpoint is determined to be the midpoint between the femur head and patella of the left leg, which was also the centerpoint of the volumetric MRI during acquisition. The superior-inferior length of ROI was fixed at 25 mm. The ROI in-plane dimensions are equal to the MRI in-plane field of view noted in the previous paragraph. An ROI example is displayed in Fig. 2 . We applied our tissue identification and characterization techniques to the part of each MRI scan defined by these ROIs. Furthermore, in order to reduce the effect of gender differences on our analysis, we selected a cohort of female participants. Our final dataset consisted of 64 female subjects with age 67.44 \u00b1 3.15 (95% CI) years.\nTo estimate the group separation produced by each feature, we first calculated p-values produced by t-tests and Fisher's distances. Table I contains the list of statistically significant features with p < 0.05, the corresponding p-values, and the Fisher's distances. Out of the 14 features with statistically significant pvalues, 11 originated from the proposed tissue density modeling in the original or the transformed feature space, but none of these features was related to absolute tissue area measurements. Table II displays the pairs of highly correlated features that were \niteratively merged to perform dimensionality reduction according to HDR. This technique identified increased correlation between covariance and eigenvalue features, and intensity means and GMM parameters, as expected. The limitation of HDR is that it does not explicitly seek the most discriminant features. Table III lists the features selected by MRMR in our classification experiments. Out of the 12 selected features, 5 features originated from our intensity distribution model parameters either in the standardized or the transformed domain, 5 features were mean estimates in the standardized intensity domain, and the remaining 2 were the mean IMAT area computed over the ROI-that is, a volumetric measure-and the muscle area fraction, which is defined as the fraction of mean muscle area over the sum of the mean muscle area and mean IMAT area. It is interesting that the last two tissue area-related features have also been identified as possible predictors of muscular degeneration.\nIn addition, we trained and tested a support vector machinebased classifier to separate low MQ from high MQ participants in the same feature domain. Classification accuracy was estimated in a stratified tenfold cross-validation framework. The stratification was employed to ensure that the number of subjects assigned to each class was approximately equal in the training and testing phases. Furthermore, the tenfold cross-validation technique reduced the possible effect of overfitting. Each crossvalidation experiment was repeated 100 times to reduce variability due to randomized fold selection. Moreover, we repeated our aforementioned experiments using leave-one-out cross validation. Classification performance metrics produced by the different domains are summarized in Tables IV and V. To estimate classification performance, we used the following measures derived from the contingency table.\n1) TPR, also called Recall, or Sensitivity-Ratio of true positives TP to the number of detected positives P given by TPR = Table IV presented as mean \u00b1 95% confidence interval half widthindicated that our analysis technique can separate low from high MQ subjects with an accuracy of 71.4 \u00b1 0.6% in the complete feature space. Among the reduced feature spaces, the MRMR method produced the highest classification accuracy at 70.9 \u00b1 0.9%. The hierarchical dimensionality reduction technique with a correlation threshold at 95%, which iteratively merged features with greater than 95% correlation, yielded classification accuracy of 69.3 \u00b1 0.7% in a domain reduced to The leave-one-out cross-validation experiments yielded some interesting results (see Table V ). The MRMR technique produced the highest classification accuracy at 78.1%, followed by the complete feature domain and Fisher's distance ranking at 73.4%, and hierarchical dimensionality reduction at 71.9%. We also computed ROC performance for the leave-one-out cross validation, as displayed in Fig. 5 . We note that MRMR produced the largest area under the curve (AUC) among the tested feature selection approaches. The superior performance of MRMR may be attributed to the fact that it simultaneously reduces the redundancy and optimizes for relevance of the feature set as explained in [18] .\nWe observe that the sets of more discriminant features selected by the Student's t-test and MRMR dimensionality reduction, shown in Tables I and III , lend credence to our premise that the proposed tissue intensity distribution models contribute to the prediction of low MQ. Also, our feature selection and classification results reported in Tables III-V, suggest that the MR intensity standardization using SAT reference intensities largely suppresses the effects of intersubject variability on the dynamic range of MR voxel intensities, therefore, producing discriminant features. Nevertheless, the standardized intensities may still change when different MRI acquisition parameters, such as flip angle and TR, are used. In addition, our multivariate classification experiments indicated an encouraging separation between groups of low and high MQ, further supporting the relationship between characteristics of muscle composition and function.\nThe fact that the proposed methodology is automated, is by itself an advantage that greatly reduces the need for manual delineation of tissues and quantification. When considering the computational cost of this approach, the computational time for segmentation and feature calculation over an ROI of five slices is 56.6 \u00b1 0.8 s. The feature selection and prediction procedures at the online stage-that is, excluding the offline trainingare very fast: 10 \u22124 \u00b1 3.5 \u00d7 10 \u22126 s for the complete domain, 6 \u00d7 10 \u22124 \u00b1 2.7 \u00d7 10 \u22125 s for FDR, 2.4 \u00d7 10 \u22123 \u00b1 2.8 \u00d7 10 \u22125 s for HDR, and 1.1 \u00d7 10 \u22123 \u00b1 2.2 \u00d7 10 \u22125 s for MRMR. These computational times were obtained from our MATLAB implementation on a Linux-based platform with an 8-core Intel Xeon x86_64 CPU at 3.3 GHz and with 8 GB of RAM. We used the MATLAB wrapper of the libsvm library for support vector machine classification. The segmentation code can be significantly optimized for time and space once it is implemented in a compiled language such as C/C++.\nAs an alternative means of acquiring distinct fat and water images for determination of MQ, one could employ the so-called Dixon technique [21] - [23] . Dixon sequences achieve fat-water separation based on the chemical shift difference between fat and water and the consequent modulations of the echo train generated by a multiecho sequence, and do not rely upon chemical species suppression as in this study. This study was performed in the absence of this specialized capability, but nevertheless demonstrates our ability to perform MQ assessments and correlations. These outcome measures are essentially independent of whether the method we chose, or a Dixon method, was used for data acquisition.\nAlthough the assessment of MQ could be estimated in clinical practice by simpler measures such as DEXA and hand grip, those simpler measures do not provide any clue on the origin and pathophysiology of the decline in MQ with aging and diseases. On the contrary, particular imaging characteristics that are associated with lower MQ may help understanding the underlying mechanisms of the decline in MQ with aging, and therefore, suggest possible interventions, and provide biomarkers for tracking their effectiveness. For example, the findings of this study suggest that muscle fat infiltration is one nonexhaustive mechanism that leads to reduced MQ. Thus, intervention that prevents muscle fat infiltration is likely to be effective in preventing the decline in MQ with aging. The proposed analysis could also be utilized to track the effect of interventions that may theoretically improve MQ, such as resistance exercise. It is well known that resistance training in the first week is associated with substantial increment in strength without any change in mass. It would be interesting in the future to verify that the descriptor of MQ computed by this technique captures the changes in the muscle over the first week that account for the increase in strength.\nWe should also note that the MRI techniques used for our analysis are sensitive to body composition, but do not provide data on other contributors to MQ decline, such as denervation and bioenergetic alterations, due to either mitochondrial dysfunction or metabolic changes."}, {"section_title": "VI. CONCLUSION", "text": "We have presented an MRI-based muscle and IMAT characterization model that utilizes information produced by tissue quantification. Our central hypothesis is that we can use the MRI-based MQ signatures to predict biomechanical properties of the midthigh, namely the muscle quality index MQ. In our method, we estimate statistical properties of [NS,FS,WS] MR intensity distributions with emphasis on Gaussian mixture models of muscle and IMAT voxel intensities in the joint [FS,WS] domain and the eigendecomposition of the covariance matrices. To test our hypothesis, we validated the separation capability of our technique against reference data produced by independent clinical measures of muscle strength. Our technique produced encouraging separation between low and high MQ subjects. "}]
