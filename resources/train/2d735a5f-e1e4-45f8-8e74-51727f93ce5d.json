Targeted farmers make up as much as 40 percent of all U.S. farms, and, although many participate in conservation programs, targeted farmers typically have not participated in government agricultural programs at the same rate as other farmers.

Such Federal provisions can alter program outcomes in unintended ways if targeted farmers adopt different conservation practices, address different environmental needs, or operate land that is more or less environmentally sensitive than the land operated by other farmers. Targeting certain farmer types could result in tradeoffs between environmental performance, cost-effective delivery of program benefi ts, and improved access to Federal conservation programs. This report addresses this issue by examining participation patterns in the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), and Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP) to provide information on the types of farmers who enroll, the geographic distribution of participants, the types and costs of conservation practices they implement, the resource issues they address, the natural resource characteristics associated with their farms, and whether different types of farmers participate in different ways. Participation rates are measured where possible based on both the number of farms and acres enrolled in conservation programs, as these two measures can provide very different pictures of targeted farmer participation. Those three conservation programs account for 74 percent of authorized conservation spending in the 2008 Farm Act."}, {"section_title": "What Did the Study Find?", "text": "During 2004-07, targeted farmers participated differently in conservation programs than did other farmers. While not defi nitive, evidence shows that targeted farmers tended to operate more environmentally sensitive land than other farmers, had different conservation priorities, and received different levels of payments. Those differences suggest that economic and environmental outcomes could change if the proportion of targeted farmers enrolled in the programs increases signifi cantly."}, {"section_title": "Enrollment Patterns", "text": "Beginning and limited-resource farmers-two of the three targeted-farmer groups-were less likely to participate in EQIP than was the U.S. farm population as a whole (data on socially disadvantaged farmer participation in EQIP were not available). These two farmer types operated about 27 percent of all farms in 2006 but held 12 percent of EQIP contracts. This participation trend was observed in nearly every region of the country, suggesting that policies that make it easier for these farmers to enroll could increase participation. One new policy aimed at encouraging participation, however, is likely to have little effect. The 2008 Farm Act requires that 5 percent of EQIP funds be set aside annually for beginning farmers, but beginning farmers have typically received more than 10 percent of EQIP payments annually in recent years.\nLike their participation patterns in EQIP, targeted farmers enrolled disproportionately fewer farms in conservation programs that retire land from production. Twenty-two percent of farms operated by all three groups of targeted farmers were enrolled in the CRP and WRP, even though they operate 31 percent of all farms. A different pattern emerges, however, when the amount of enrolled acreage is evaluated instead of the number of enrolled farmers: Targeted farmers enrolled disproportionately more acreage in CRP and WRP than other farmers. Targeted farmers operated 15 percent of farmland acres in 2007 but controlled 17 percent of acres enrolled in these programs."}, {"section_title": "Environmental Problems and Priorities for Treatment", "text": "Beginning farmers in the Delta region (the only area for which we could analyze soil data) who participated in EQIP tended to enroll more highly erodible land than other participating farmers. This trend suggests that conservation efforts by these farmers could provide more program benefi ts than efforts by other farmers. The available data, however, make it diffi cult to determine with certainty if targeting these farmers would increase program benefi ts because the characteristics of program participants may not represent this farmer group as a whole. If, in general, few beginning farmers operate highly erodible land (and the few that do have \"self-selected\" and have already chosen to enroll), targeting more of these farmers for enrollment may not provide more conservation benefi ts than are provided by other farmer types.\nConservation priorities of farmers participating in conservation programs differ by farmer type. Beginning and limited-resource farmers enrolled in EQIP addressed livestock forage and health needs and plant productivity/ quality issues more often than did other farmer types. And although both beginning and limited-resource farmers participating in EQIP were more likely to farm closer to quality-impaired waters, the limited-resource farmers were less likely to address water quality problems. Several possible reasons may explain these tendencies. First, limited-resource farmers may face fi nancial or other constraints in adopting practices that might improve water quality. Second, these farmers may derive more direct benefi ts by focusing on other issues (like improving plant health and vigor). Finally, limitedresource farmers tend to operate smaller farms that are not subject to the same regulatory requirements facing larger farm operators who use EQIP to fund water pollution reduction practices (e.g., pollutant discharge regulations for concentrated animal feeding operations). In land retirement programs, targeted farmers of all types were more likely than other farmer types to be located in areas where proposed conservation efforts were expected to achieve the greatest reduction in soil erosion and the greatest improvement in water quality."}, {"section_title": "Costs of Treatment", "text": "The size of conservation payments varied among farmer groups.\n\u2022 In EQIP, average payments (which represent the cost to government) to beginning farmers were signifi cantly higher than the average payments to other farmers, while payments to limited-resource farmers were significantly lower.

The analysis used the ARMS data from 2004-07 to analyze payment and acreage enrollments in CRP and WRP by farmer type and to summarize the characteristics of targeted farmers. The 2001 ARMS data on conservation practice adoption (the most recent year data were available) were used to examine conservation practice adoption patterns in land retirement programs. The census, NRI, and other data characterized the distribution of farmer types relative to measures of environmental conditions. EQIP, CRP, ARMS, NRI, and census data were used to characterize differences among current conservation program participants and to suggest that targeted and other farmers may differ in their ability to provide environmental benefi ts cost effectively. Providing fi rm answers about the impacts of favoring particular farmer types would require more information, including quantitative estimates of the environmental benefi ts provided by different farmer types and whether targeted participants are more cost-effective providers of benefi ts than nonparticipants. Also, targeted farmers' acreages are disproportionately small, and information about program participants' farm sizes would be needed to distinguish whether differences between farmer types are due to the type of farmer or farm size."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The Federal Government has a long history of providing assistance to farmers and ranchers to encourage the adoption of practices that reduce unintended negative environmental spillovers from agricultural production. Much of this conservation assistance is provided through voluntary programs that help fi nance the installation of conservation structures (e.g., riparian buffers and grassed waterways) and the adoption of environmentally friendly land management practices or that provide technical support to identify conservation needs and develop implementation plans. The 2008 Food, Conservation, and Energy Act (2008 Farm Act) is projected to increase conservation program funding by more than 17 percent. If appropriated at authorized levels, $11.5 billion in conservation assistance will go to working farm and ranchland that remain in production, and $13 billion will go to land retirement programs.\nBoth the 2002 and 2008 Farm Act legislation included provisions that ensure accessibility for all eligible farmers and ranchers to conservation programs. These provisions provide favorable payment terms to reduce unintentional barriers to participation for farmers who may face unique circumstances, such as limited farming experience, limited fi nancial resources, and limited opportunities. The favorable payment terms are available to beginning, limited-resource, or socially disadvantaged segments of the farm population (\"targeted farmers\" for the purposes of this report).\nTargeted farmers' characteristics can affect their participation in conservation programs (see box, \"Defi ning Targeted Farmers\"). For example, recent Economic Research Service (ERS) research shows that beginning farmers tend to have smaller farms, lower levels of onfarm income, and different personal and household characteristics than do established farms (Ahearn and Newton, 2009 ) and that these differences can affect decisions about conservation activities (Lambert et al., 2006; Caswell et al., 2001 ).\nProviding favorable payment terms to particular types of farmers may make Federal conservation programs more accessible if targeted farmers could not participate without them. Some evidence suggests that encouraging participation by targeted farmers may also alter the environmental benefi ts generated by conservation programs. Comparing the distribution of farmer types and highly erodible land suggests that socially disadvantaged farmers are more likely than other farmers to be located in counties where a higher proportion of cropland is highly erodible (fi g. 1). 1 When farmers are more likely to operate marginal land, targeting them for participation could increase the environmental benefi ts provided by conservation programs.\nChanging program participation rates among targeted farmers could also affect program costs, and whether costs increase or decrease depends on the cost effectiveness of practices implemented by new participants. If the farmers who enroll in conservation programs provide environmental benefi ts at the lowest cost, encouraging their participation achieves both economic and accessibility goals. If applicants from targeted groups provide benefi ts at a higher cost, encouraging their participation may improve access at the expense of economic goals.\n1 This comparison uses 2007 Census of Agriculture data, which identifi es the principal operator's race and ethnicity, and 1997 National Resources Inventory data that identifi es cropland by erodibility level. The ARMS data used in this report defi ne socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers, but the Census data do not allow us to identify these farmers in precisely the same way (see appendix, \"Data Sources\"). However, the geographic distribution of these farmers is comparable between Census and ARMS.\nThis report examines participation patterns of targeted farmers relative to other farmers in major Federal conservation programs. We focus on the extent of their participation, the geographic distribution of participants, the types and costs of conservation practices implemented, and resource issues farmers typically face and address. Although the available data preclude a defi nitive assessment of economic tradeoffs from improving accessibility, this report improves our understanding of how these farmers use and impact conservation programs.

Our defi nitions correspond to USDA defi nitions to the extent that available data allow us to do so.\nBeginning farmers and ranchers (BF)-Using data from USDA's Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) (see appendix, \"Data Sources\"), we can identify up to three operators per farm and defi ne beginning farmers and ranchers as operators with not more than 10 years of experience. In 2006, however, ARMS identifi es more than one operator in only one version of the survey. For that year, we defi ne beginning farms as those operated by a primary operator with not more than 10 years of experience. USDA generally defi nes beginning farmers and ranchers as those who materially and substantially participate in farm or ranch operations, but have not operated a farm or ranch for more than 10 consecutive years. If operated by an entity, this requirement applies to all members of the entity (USDA, 2007).\nLimited-resource farmers and ranchers (LR)-Farmers and ranchers are defi ned as limited resource if in each of the last 2 years they earned less than $105,000 in gross farm sales (adjusted for infl ation) and had low household income (USDA, 2007; Hoppe et al., 2007) . Low household income means that the household income was less than the national poverty level for a family of four or was less than half the county median household income in the 2 previous years.\nSocially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers (SDA)-In this report, we defi ne a farm as operated by a socially disadvantaged farmer and rancher if the principal operator is African American, American Indian, Alaskan Native, Hispanic, Asian American, or Pacifi c Islander. We do not include women in this defi nition. While some socially disadvantaged farmer defi nitions include groups subject to gender prejudice, our defi nition is consistent with the Conservation Title in the 2008 Farm Act, which excludes women (unless they meet the socially disadvantaged defi nition some other way). Prior to the 2008 Farm Act, conservation programs administered by USDA did not use socially disadvantaged farmer defi nitions. USDA does, however, have various credit, insurance, and outreach programs to improve access to USDA programs for such farmers and ranchers (Dismukes et al., 1997a) ."}, {"section_title": "What We Know About Targeted Farmers", "text": "Targeted farmers include beginning, limited-resource, and socially disadvantaged farmers, and most farm operators identify with just one of these three groups (fi g. 2). During 2005-07, the largest proportion (59 percent) of farms operated by targeted farmers was beginning-farmer operations. Socially disadvantaged (SDA) farmers accounted for 21 percent and limited-resource farmers, 33 percent. These percentages sum to more than 100, signaling that some farmers belong to multiple groups. For example, 5 percent of these farmers were both beginning and socially disadvantaged farmers, and 4 percent were both beginning and limited-resource farmers. Only 1 percent of these farms were operated by farmers who belonged to all three groups.\nThe characteristics of these operations can improve our understanding about why targeted farmers might participate in conservation programs differently than other farmers. Targeted farmers operate a sizable proportion of land. In 2007, they operated about 677,000 farms-nearly 31 percent of the Nation's 2.1 million farms (fi g. 3). Yet, these farmers account for a disproportionately small amount of farm production value, contributing only 12 percent of the nearly $290 billion in farm commodities produced by all U.S. farms in 2007. This smaller farm production value refl ects the fact that a larger proportion of these farmers operate small-scale family farms (defi ned as those with less than $250,000 in sales) and that a smaller proportion of beginning and socially disadvantaged farmers identify farming as their major occupation-residential or lifestyle farms-compared with other farmer types (table 1) . 2 Limited-resource farmers are more likely to report farming as their major occupation; however, fewer farms are operated by them. Low-sales farms and farmers who devote time to nonfarming occupations may face fi nancial or labor constraints that preclude use of conservation practices that are capital-or management-intensive.\n2 The Economic Research Service developed a classifi cation system that categorizes farms based on sales, major occupation of the primary operator, and farm ownership structure. For a detailed description, see Hoppe et al., 2007 . Beginning and limited-resource farmers are somewhat more likely than other farmers to report no production value. The share of these farmers reporting zero production value varies between 26 and 28 percent, compared with 23 percent of small family farms operated by other farmer types. 3, 4 Recent research that analyzes production and conservation behavior revealed that decisions not to produce crops or livestock are positively associated with conservation payments (Lambert et al., 2006) . This suggests that conditions that temporarily rule out farming may not preclude conservation program participation, although a lack of production over several years could make some farmers ineligible to participate.\nFor farms reporting a positive production value, commodity production by targeted farmers appears similar to small family farms, at least at fi rst glance. Livestock accounts for most of the production value for farmers of all types, and more than half of socially disadvantaged farmers specialize in livestock (table 2) . Specialization in beef cattle and other grazing livestock is common among small farms, due to the low labor and low cost requirements (Hoppe et al., 2007) . Of farmers with a majority of their production value from crop 3 Production value refl ects the market value of what is produced in a given year, regardless of whether it is shared among multiple parties or put into inventory. Farms may have no production due to adverse weather conditions, disease, or other reasons (Hoppe et al., 2007) . 4 When women are included in the defi nition of socially disadvantaged farmers, the proportion of socially disadvantaged farmers reporting zero production value rises from 20 percent to 33 percent.

Limited-resource farmers may be more likely to face liquidity constraints due to lower net farm income and a higher operating expense ratio compared with other farmer types (table 2) . Limitedresource farmers rely most heavily on off-farm income, the majority of which comes from unearned sources (Social Security, pensions, dividends, interest, and rent) (Hoppe et al., 2007) . Most socially disadvantaged and beginning farmers operate residential farms, and most of their off-farm income comes from earned wages or self-employment (Hoppe et al., 2007) .\nTargeted farmers are located across the United States, but some geographical concentration exists. The proportion of farms owned by beginning farmers ranges from 4 percent to 50 percent across U.S. counties, with higher proportions concentrated in Texas, Arizona, Colorado, and Florida (Ahearn and Newton, 2009 ). Socially disadvantaged farmers appear dispersed as a whole, but a large majority of African American farms are found in the South, and most American Indian farmers are found west of the Mississippi River. Farms operated by Asian/Pacifi c Islander operators are concentrated in California and Hawaii, while Hispanic-operated farms are concentrated in California, Colorado, Florida, New Mexico, and Texas (Dismukes et al., 1997a (Dismukes et al., , 1997b "}, {"section_title": ". Participation in Conservation Programs by Targeted Farmers / EIB-62", "text": "Economic Research Service/USDA"}, {"section_title": "Conservation Programs Available to Targeted Farmers", "text": "All farmers have the opportunity to participate in Federal conservation programs, as long as they meet program eligibility requirements. Certain program provisions are specifi cally designed to increase access to workinglands programs for targeted farmers and ranchers. Understanding the differences in program incentives, eligibility, and purpose help explain observed patterns of program participation by members of these groups.\nFederal agricultural conservation programs use a voluntary approach to improve environmental conditions related to agricultural production. Federal conservation funding is divided among land retirement, working-lands conservation, land preservation, and technical assistance programs. Of these, the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), and Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP) are the three largest programs and constitute about 70 percent of USDA conservation spending (see box, \"Major Federal Conservation Programs\").\nConservation programs use different approaches to address environmental concerns. Some goals of the major Federal conservation programs are similar-including reducing soil erosion, improving water and air quality, and enhancing wildlife habitat-but the approaches used to achieve these goals are different. The CRP and WRP seek to improve environmental quality by retiring environmentally sensitive land from production. EQIP helps producers address environmental concerns by providing fi nancial assistance to install conservation structures and adopt management practices on agricultural lands that remain in production.\nSome farmers may be more likely than others to participate in land retirement than in working lands programs, although many farmers may participate in both. The CRP and WRP have historically been popular, in part, because of the steady source of income that producers can receive from annual rental payments. Retired farmers and operators whose primary occupation is not farming may be more likely than other farmers to retire land and enroll in CRP and more likely to use land retirement conservation practices than working-lands practices (Lambert et al., 2006) . As a working-lands program, EQIP may be most attractive to producers who want to improve environmental performance without reducing the operation's productive capacity, who operate land that is not eligible for CRP or WRP enrollment, who apply to CRP or WRP but are not accepted, or who favor shorter term conservation program contracts.\nEQIP and land retirement programs have different enrollment methods and criteria. In CRP, highly erodible land is eligible for enrollment if it has been planted with an agricultural commodity (including alfalfa and other multi-year grasses and legumes in rotation) in 4 of the 6 crop years prior to 2002 or is located in a designated conservation priority area. 5 In general signups, which account for the vast majority of enrolled acreage, applications from across the country are pooled, ranked, and selected according to an Environmental Benefi ts Index (EBI) score (see box, \"Major Federal Conservation Programs\" Many factors can affect farmers' decisions to participate in conservation programs, including whether the fi nancial benefi ts from enrolling exceed the costs, the type and severity of environmental problems they face, and whether they believe their chances of being accepted will offset the transaction costs of enrolling. Analyzing enrollment patterns can illuminate whether different types of farmers participate in these programs to different degrees.\nBeginning and limited-resource farmers may be under-represented in EQIP, but representation in CRP and WRP is less clear. Participation in EQIP can be measured for farms operated by beginning farmers and limitedresource farmers-the two groups for which data on farmer status were collected during our study period (fi g. 4). 6 These two groups operated about 27 percent of all farms, but were associated with only 12 percent of EQIP contracts and received 15 percent of EQIP fi nancial assistance payments. 7 Data on the number of acres operated by type of EQIP participant were not available, so evaluating participation by this measure was not possible. Also, although limited-resource farmers were about twice as likely to report farming as their major occupation than beginning farmers, they were no more likely to participate in EQIP.\nThe extent to which particular farmer types participate in land retirement programs depends on how participation is measured. When participation is measured based on enrolled acres, the data suggest targeted farmers are proportionally represented in these conservation programs. These farmers operated nearly 15 percent of farmland acres and controlled 17 percent of acres enrolled in CRP and WRP in 2007 (fi g. 5). On the other hand, these 6 Although we are not able to identify socially disadvantaged farmers in the EQIP contract data, we are able to determine which contracts are on or near Indian reservations. See box, \"EQIP Participation on American Indian Reservations.\"\n7 Some farms have more than one EQIP contract. However, counting contracts instead of farms does not appear to bias the representation of beginning and limited-resource producers. farmers operated 31 percent of all farms, but they operated only 22 percent of farms enrolled in CRP or WRP. Taken together, the data suggest that, although disproportionately fewer of these farmers enroll land in land retirement programs, those that do enroll tend to enroll more of their land.\nComparing payment patterns across programs suggests that participation rates by beginning and limited-resource farmers were not clearly higher in EQIP than in CRP/WRP (data on socially disadvantaged farmer participation in EQIP are not available). These two groups of farmers received similar proportions of payments in both programs (15.1 percent in EQIP and 15.0 percent in CRP/WRP). The proportions are similar despite the eligibility of beginning and limited-resource farmers for more favorable payment terms in EQIP since 2002 and their enrollment priority in some States. However, a gap between EQIP and CRP/WRP, in terms of these farmers' participation rates (as measured by payments), could have existed without the favorable terms. A gap might also have existed if a CRP eligibility requirement that all land offered for retirement be previously cropped 4 of the 6 crop years prior to 2002 had not been in effect (USDA-FSA, 2008) . A signifi cantly smaller proportion of beginning and limited-resource farmers specialize in crop production (table 2), so fewer of these farmers qualify for CRP enrollment. The relative sizes of the programs may also matter. CRP and WRP expenditures exceeded EQIP expenditures by at least 2 to 1 in recent years, so land retirement programs were able to enroll more participants of all types. A preference for land retirement programs may be due, in part, to beginning and limited-resource farmers fi nding reduced labor requirements of land retirement practices more appealing Lambert et al., 2006 Although much of this report focuses on the enrollment patterns of different types of farmers, it is also important to examine conservation programs in certain types of communities or geographic areas. This places more emphasis on where conservation practices are adopted and what types of communities may accrue environmental benefi ts from conservation programs.\nAs an example, we examined EQIP participation and practice adoption on American Indian reservations and trust land. Reservation communities may be considered disadvantaged by a variety of measures, including household income and poverty rates, educational attainment, health outcomes (Ward et al., 2004) , and food security (Gundersen, 2008 EQIP=Environmental Quality incentives Program; BF = Beginning farmer; LR = Limited resource farmer. *Indicates signifi cant differences between reservation and nonreservation farms based on pairwise two-tailed delete-a-group jackknife tstatistics at the 90-percent confi dence level. See Kott, 2001 .\nNationwide, 641 contracts in 2006 were on a reservation, or about 2 percent of all contracts. We then compared these reservation contracts with contracts outside American Indian reservation borders.\nContracts on reservations received larger total payments from EQIP contracts than contracts off reservations. The median total contract payment was between $6,000 and $11,000 larger on reservations, even after accounting for differences between beginning and limited-resource farmers and other farmers. Beginning and limitedresource farmers are eligible for higher cost-share rates, which may result in larger payments for the same size practice. In this case, the scale of practices may account for a portion of the larger payments on reservations.\nCalculating the average sizes of the most common structural practices (e.g., fences and pipelines) confi rm that contracts on reservations tend to involve larger structures. Some evidence suggests that larger payments and practices may yield greater environmental benefi ts, at least when addressing certain environmental concerns . To the extent that this relationship holds for EQIP participants, per contract environmental benefi ts may be greater for reservation contracts.\nFarms on reservations are less likely to be enrolled in EQIP than nonreservation farms. Reservations account for about 9.3 percent of farms and 7.7 percent of operated farmland in the comparison States, but about 4.2 percent of EQIP contracts and 6.2 percent of EQIP funding in 2006. Participation in EQIP depends on a variety of landscape and farm-level factors, so it is diffi cult to say if under-representation in this case amounts to being underserved. For example, contracts on reservations are less likely to be associated with cropland that is designated as highly erodible. Underrepresentation in EQIP may refl ect differences in environmental conditions that make participation less likely on reservation farms.\nAre American Indian reservations less likely to accrue benefi ts from participation in EQIP? The results suggest a mixed conclusion. Reservation farms appear to be under-represented in EQIP, but this fact alone is not conclusive. EQIP contracts on reservation farmland are more likely to be associated with beginning or limitedresource farmers and to be eligible for higher cost-share rates. The higher cost-share rates may encourage participation among farmers who might not otherwise be able to participate in EQIP. Also, the typical contracts in EQIP are larger and may provide greater environmental benefi ts per contract on reservations. Contracts on reservation farmland also appear to address different environmental issues, which suggests that the benefi ts derived from EQIP contracts are different for reservation communities. Reservation contracts are less likely to address soil erosion and water quality problems and more likely to address issues related to plant condition and domestic animals. Addressing different environmental concerns may also affect the cost and the size of practices. A variety of factors, however, infl uence the benefi ts derived from conservation practices, and further study is needed to examine how these factors may be related to the distribution of environmental benefi ts from EQIP.\nAnother program design difference between working lands and land retirement programs could affect relative participation patterns across programs. Applicants in CRP and WRP can bid down the amount of payment they are willing to accept to improve their chances of enrollment, but bidding has not been allowed in EQIP since 2002 due to perceptions that it favored larger or more well off farmers (USDA, 2003) . Beginning and limited-resource farmers' participation at similar rates in land retirement programs-programs where bidding is allowed-raises questions about whether bidding puts these farmers at a competitive disadvantage. Allowing producers to bid down the payments can improve program cost effectiveness, when enrollment priority is given to producers who could provide environmental benefi ts most cost effectively. However, many factors affect decisions about participation in working lands and land retirement programs (Lambert et al., 2006) , and further studies would need to account for these characteristics to determine whether bidding options do affect participation rates.

The U.S. territories also play an important role in limited-resource producer contracts, both in terms of numbers and as a percentage of contracts in the region. In 2006, 174 contracts were written with limited-resource farmers in the Pacifi c Basin and Caribbean, and these contracts represent over 50 percent of all contracts held by farmers in the U.S. territories.\nIn CRP and WRP, 18 percent of all contracts were held by beginning farmers during the 2005-07 period, and these farmers participated in proportions similar to that of the farm population in a few regions (fi g. 8).

These farmers represented 17 percent of the farmer population and operated about 14 percent of the acres, but accounted for 23 percent of CRP/WRP participants and about 35 percent of acres enrolled in the region.\nIn land retirement programs, notable differences also exist in regional participation patterns for limited-resource and socially disadvantaged farmers.

Producers will choose the problems they want to address and practices they want to implement that best meet their needs, provide the greatest fi nancial returns, and are likely to receive funding from conservation program managers. Examining natural resource characteristics and enrollment data highlight whether targeted farmers participate in conservation programs differently than other farmer types."}, {"section_title": "EQIP", "text": "Do beginning and limited-resource farmers participating in EQIP operate more environmentally sensitive land? Some evidence suggests \"yes.\" While precise data on the underlying physical characteristics of land receiving treatment through EQIP-funded practices are not available, we can characterize two aspects of the land in the general vicinity of EQIP contracts: soil erodibility and proximity to quality-impaired waters. 9 When examining correlations between producer types and highly erodible soils, we limited our analysis to four States-Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi (States in the Delta region), and Alabama-because of the computational burden involved in associating soils data with EQIP contracts. These States were selected because they have both a relatively large number of EQIP contracts (each had more than 1,000 contracts signed in 2006) and a minimum of about 5 percent of contracts each with beginning and limited-resource producers.\nWhen examining the relationship between EQIP contracts and qualityimpaired waters, we used national-level data. We determined proximity of farms to streams and water bodies with pollution problems by using hydrologic data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's database on waters considered impaired under the Clean Water Act. These distance measures were used for all EQIP contracts in the continental United States.\nUsing 2006 EQIP contract data, our analysis reveals: 10\n\u2022 In the Delta region, beginning-farmer contracts were located in areas with signifi cantly greater average percentages of highly erodible land (54 percent) compared with contracts with other farmer types (47 percent).\n\u2022 For limited-resource producers in the Delta region, an average of 50 percent of nearby land was highly erodible, which was not statistically different from the percentage for other farmer types.\n\u2022 Nationally, both beginning and limited-resource farmer contracts tended to be located in areas signifi cantly closer, on average, to impaired waters than contracts with other farmer types.\nThese analyses suggest that of those with EQIP contracts, beginning farmers in the Delta region may be located in areas that are more marginally productive compared with other farmer types, but that limited-resource farmers may 9 Geographic data on the location of farms with EQIP contracts, State-level estimates of farm size, and Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) data allow us to identify highly erodible soils in the \"neighborhood\" of EQIP contracts. Here, we defi ne the neighborhood as the average farm size in the State using ARMS data, and we allow this average to vary by farmer type if targeted farmers have farms signifi cantly larger or smaller than other farmer types in the State. not necessarily operate in areas with more erodible soils. Limited-resource farmers may be more likely to occupy more productive land than beginning farmers because a larger percentage of limited-resource farmers report farming as their major occupation and thus may seek to farm less highly erodible land. Producer characteristics and the underlying qualities of the land they operate can vary substantially across regions of the country, so additional analysis could determine if the correlations with erodible land in the Delta region are representative of the United States. The national analysis of a farm's proximity to impaired waters revealed that both beginning and limited-resource farmers may be operating in more environmentally sensitive areas than other farmers.\nBeginning and limited-resource farmers participating in EQIP have different conservation priorities from other participants. When different types of producers face different environmental problems, the greatest conservation program benefi ts can be reaped when their particular problems are treated. The resource concerns treated with EQIP funds depend on the producer's willingness to treat the problem, as well as government priorities. Eight broad categories of resource issues are addressed through EQIP:\n1. Air quality."}, {"section_title": "Domestic animal needs.", "text": "3. Fish and wildlife.\n4. Plant productivity/quality. 5. Soil condition.\n6. Soil erosion.\n7. Water quality."}, {"section_title": "Water quantity.", "text": "Of these, the four most frequently addressed issues are domestic animal needs, plant productivity/quality, soil erosion, and water quality, which are treated by more than 85 percent of all EQIP contracts.\nOf the four most commonly addressed resource issues, beginning and limitedresource farmers enrolled in 2006 were more likely to address plant productivity/quality issues and domestic animal forage and health needs compared with other participating farmer types (table 3) . Limited-resource farmers appeared less likely to address water quality problems compared with beginning farmers or other farmer types, even though our analysis revealed that they tended to be located closer to quality-impaired waters than other program participants. Only 25 percent of limited-resource farmers address water quality, while 36-38 percent of beginning and other farmer types do.\nThese data suggest that farmer groups have different priorities for treating resource problems. They also suggest that a closer look at whether particular constraints prevent limited-resource farmers from treating water quality problems may be warranted. A similar proportion of beginning-farmer contracts treated water quality problems compared with other farmer types in EQIP, even though other farmer types are larger and face more regulatory requirements for reducing water pollution under the Clean Water Act.\nBeginning farmers had more expensive EQIP contracts compared with other participating farmer types, while limited-resource farmers had less expensive contracts. Beginning and limited-resource farmers in EQIP have somewhat different resource priorities than other participating farmer types, and costs differ as well. On average, beginning farmers enrolled in EQIP had signifi cantly more costly contracts overall ($33,682 compared with $28,883, including both producer and government share of the costs) and received larger EQIP payments (the government share of the costs was $26,646 compared with $18,056) (table 4). Because EQIP funds a larger portion of the costs for beginning farmers to install structural practices, such as fences, waste-handling facilities, and vegetative buffers, larger payments to these producers are not surprising. Beginning farmers, however, are more likely to operate residential, retirement, or smaller farms, and a smaller proportion specialize in livestock production compared with other farmer types (see tables 1 and 2)-all characteristics that could contribute to smaller payment sizes. Livestock producers often install more expensive conservation practices to treat animal-related resource problems.\nUnlike beginning farmers, limited-resource farmers in EQIP tend to have less costly contracts overall compared with other farmer types. Limited-resource farmers also tend to have smaller farms, on average, in addition to being the most likely group of farmers to face liquidity constraints (see table 2 ).\nBeginning and limited-resource farmers received smaller per practice EQIP payments and implemented smaller scale practices but adopted a greater number of practices. Beginning and limited-resource farmers differ from other farmer types in terms of the sizes and types of practices funded by EQIP. The average incentive payment per management practice was signifi cantly smaller for beginning and limited-resource farmers (table 4), due to implementation of management practices on a smaller scale. For example, beginning farmers implemented nutrient management (the most EQIP=Environmental Quality Incentives Program. 1 Remaining four resource concerns not listed are air quality, fi sh and wildlife, soil condition, and water quantity. None of these four issues are treated by more than 10 percent of contracts for each group. 2 Includes all contracts held by farmers who are neither beginning nor limited-resource farmers or ranchers. 3 Counts are not weighted by the number of practices implemented to treat the resource concern. If treated by multiple practices, the resource concern is counted once to eliminate the effect of multiple practice adoption choices.

Beginning farmers also appear to implement this practice at a greater cost per acre.\nIn contrast to incentive payments for management practices, government payments for structural (cost-share) practices were larger for beginning farmers than for other participating farmer types, even though beginning farmers tended to implement these practices on a smaller scale. Beginning farmers are paid at higher cost-share rates, so the Federal Government picks up a higher portion of the total practice cost (see table 3 ). An analysis of structural practice sizes by farmer type confi rms that, for two of the most common structural practices (e.g., fences and pipelines), beginning farmers installed signifi cantly fewer feet of the structures. While higher per practice payments suggest that beginning farmers may not be treating environmental problems cost effectively, they may also signal that beginning farmers face more serious problems that need treatment. Both beginning and limitedresource farmers implemented signifi cantly more cost-shared practices within a single contract-3.6 and 3.1 cost-shared practices on average, compared with 2.7 cost-shared practices by other farmer types.\nA policy designed to pay a larger portion of the costs of structural and vegetative practices for typical targeted farmers could ease fi nancial constraints to adopting certain practices. Such a policy, however, may encourage these farmers to adopt more structural and vegetative practices than they would otherwise, simply because they face a lower out-of-pocket cost per unit of practice installed. While the policy could be a contributing factor, a variety of other factors may explain the higher incidence of cost-shared practices in beginning and limited-resource farmer contracts. For example, differences in production and household characteristics could matter. Previous research has found that the number of structural practices installed was positively associated with land ownership (Lambert et al., 2006) , and a larger percentage of beginning and limited-resource farmers tend to be full owners of the land they operate (see table 2 ). Differences in opportunities to receive funding for practice installation through other national and local government programs may also affect practice adoption patterns in EQIP (Feng et al., 2006; Feng et al., 2005) .\nHistorically, not all States offered higher cost-share rates to beginning and limited-resource farmers. For example, Oregon, Missouri, and Iowa did not pay higher cost-share rates to beginning or limited-resource producers in 2006. However, the 2008 Farm Act provision mandating that all targeted farmers receive a cost-share rate at least 25 percent higher than the normal rate in EQIP (up to a maximum share rate of 90 percent) may increase their participation, particularly in States that previously offered them no cost-share advantage.\nIn addition to a greater number of practices, beginning and limited-resource farmers have increasingly adopted cost-shared structural practices in combination with management practices. The proportion of beginning farmers using combinations of structural and management practices in EQIP increased from 43 percent to about 51 percent during 2004-06 (fi g. 10). The proportion of beginning farmers implementing strictly cost-share practices through EQIP declined from 52 percent to 42 percent over the same period. Practice adoption patterns were similar for limited-resource farmers. The practice combinations adopted by other participating farmer types, however, remained steadier over this period, with about 31 percent adopting a combination of structural and management practices and 50 percent installing strictly structural practices. Beginning farmers are more likely to have longer contracts than other program participants. Other farmer types participating in EQIP are more likely to have single-year contracts (40 percent compared with 27 percent for beginning farmers). Over the 2004-06 period, more beginning farmers signed EQIP contracts that lasted at least 4 years (up to 27 percent of farmers in 2006), whereas only 17 percent of other farmer types had contracts that long. Although the 2002 Farm Act legislation reduced the minimum length of EQIP contracts from 5 years to 1 year, the reduction in length appears to be less important for beginning farmers. Shorter contract length can reduce risks from having long-term obligations to fulfi ll, as well as uncertainty about farm returns, which could be considered attractive benefi ts to all farmer types (USDA, 2003) . Spreading implementation of certain practices over more contract years, however, may suit farmers who face labor or capital constraints that pose diffi culties for rapid adoption.\nTaken together, these fi ndings reveal that beginning and limited-resource farmers participate in working-lands programs in different ways than other farmer types. Beginning and limited-resource farmers participating in EQIP may be located in areas that are more environmentally sensitive and, in the Delta region, more marginally productive compared with other program participants, and they address somewhat different resource issues at different costs."}, {"section_title": "CRP and WRP", "text": "Analysis of environmental problems, resources receiving treatment, and costs incurred by participants suggest that farmer participation in land retirement may not follow the same pattern as in EQIP. CRP and WRP involve a different set of program incentives that may affect the pattern of enrollment choices.\nTargeted farmers participating in CRP/WRP tend to be concentrated in counties with the highest average percentage of cropland designated as highly erodible. Other program participants are more likely to be located in counties with a lower percentage of land that is highly erodible. This distribution of farmers is similar to that between beginning farmers and other program participants in EQIP in the Delta region. Contract data do not identify producer status in land retirement programs, so only general characterizations are possible using ARMS and the 1997 National Resources Inventory data on the erodibility of land.\nTargeted farmers who participate in CRP may be more likely to treat soil erosion and water quality problems that provide more environmental benefi ts. Targeted farmers participating in CRP tend to be concentrated in counties where participants, in general, were expected to generate the highest soil erosion reduction and water quality benefi ts. Approximately 44 percent of targeted farmers who participate in CRP/WRP are located in counties where participants as a whole generate the highest third of Environmental Benefi t Index (EBI) scores for average soil erosion reduction benefi ts. 11 About 33 percent of other participating farmer types are located in those counties. Similarly, about 40 percent of targeted participants in CRP/ WRP farm in counties with the highest third of EBI scores for average water quality benefi ts, compared with about 29 percent for other farmer types. 12 11 CRP contract data contain information on the environmental problems that participants agree to treat in that program. The EBI score associated with each contract provides a relative ranking of the anticipated benefi ts (effectiveness of retiring land and installing contracted practices) in treating resource problems (see box, \"Major Federal Conservation Programs\"). Thus, scores vary by participant, depending on the physical characteristics of the participants' land and the effectiveness of practices that participants are willing to adopt. Although these data do not distinguish participants by farmer type and we cannot precisely identify the resource issues targeted farmers agree to treat in land retirement programs, the EBI allows us to characterize average expected benefi ts at a county level. For this analysis, we focus on variation in average scores for two factors that are part of the contract's EBI: the scores associated with soil erosion reduction and water quality benefi ts. 12 The difference between farmer types' concentration in high-EBI-score counties was statistically tested using a binary Pearson's chi-square test statistic. The frequency of targeted farmers in counties with the highest 10 percent, 20 percent, and 30 percent of soil erosion and water quality EBI scores was signifi cantly different from other farmer types at a 99-percent confi dence level.\nContract costs and practices adopted by targeted farmers participating in CRP and WRP share some similarities to contracts with other farmer types, but differences exist among particular groups. Beginning farmers received land retirement payments that were about $1,400 less than payments to other farmer types. This payment difference is statistically signifi cant, but the number of acres enrolled was not signifi cantly different. 13 The opposite holds for limited-resource and socially disadvantaged farmers; average payments were not signifi cantly different from those of other farmer types, but the average total acres enrolled is signifi cantly larger (table 5) . Differences in payment and enrolled acreage patterns could exist due to differences in characteristics between these groups of farmers (tables 1 and 2). Unlike EQIP, differences in CRP/WRP payments across producer types are not a result of special treatment, such as the differential cost-share rates offered to targeted farmers in EQIP.\nOn a per acre basis, targeted farmers received signifi cantly lower CRP/WRP payments, relative to other participating farmer types (table 5); per acre payments were between 25 percent and 30 percent lower for these farmers. Several characteristics could contribute to this per acre difference, including concentrations of these farmers in the Southern Plains where payment rates are typically low (Ahearn and Newton, 2009 ). The differences could also arise due to underlying infl uences on bidding behavior. CRP and WRP allow landowners to bid down the rental payment they are willing to accept to improve their chances of enrollment. Many targeted farmers do not farm as a primary occupation and rely more heavily on off-farm sources of income (table 2) . These farmers, in particular, may be willing to bid down the rental payment more than other farmer types.\nTargeted farmers enrolled a larger portion of their operated acreage in CRP or WRP. The average beginning farmer had more than 54 percent of operated acreage enrolled in CRP or WRP; the average limited-resource or socially disadvantaged farmer enrolled 57 percent (table 5) . A greater percentage of targeted farmers tended to be full owners and may fi nd it easier to make decisions to retire larger amounts of land under CRP/WRP contracts of 10 13 Payments in land retirement programs include rental payments (CRP), easement payments (WRP), and costshare payments for practice installation (CRP and WRP). Payments in CRP also include the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP). The ARMS data on conservation program payments do not readily distinguish between the three payment types. This fi nding is consistent with Ahearn and Newton (2009) . years or more (Lambert et al., 2007) . Indeed, previous research found tenure is positively associated with the proportion of farm acreage enrolled in land retirement programs (Lambert et al., 2006) . Also, many of these farmers are retired and may be more likely to enroll land in land retirement programs (Wu, 2004) .\nTargeted farmers do not implement signifi cantly different types or numbers of practices in land retirement programs. Whole-fi eld practices were the most common practices among all participants in 2001, according to the most recent data available that allows analysis of practice adoption by producer type. A larger percentage of targeted farmers retired whole fi elds and rehabilitated land for wildlife needs than other farmer types, and a larger percentage adopted a greater number of the listed practices, but these differences were not statistically signifi cant (table 6 ). 14 14 The 2001ARMS questionnaire included questions about types of conservation practices applied. These data allow some analysis of adoption patterns of CRP-eligible practices funded through land retirement programs, although the small sample sizes limit the reliability of tests for statistically signifi cant differences between farmer types. Sample size limitations also preclude analyzing each of the three types of underenrolled farmers separately. "}, {"section_title": "Conclusions and Policy Implications", "text": "Since 2002, some Federal conservation programs have included provisions aimed at encouraging participation by targeted farmers. Little is known, however, about whether changing the participation rates of targeted farmers might affect benefi ts generated by, or the cost effectiveness of, conservation programs. To improve understanding about the impact on program outcomes from improving accessibility for targeted farmers, we analyzed participation patterns in EQIP and CRP/WRP to identify whether targeted farmers differ from other farmers in the types of conservation benefi ts they provide and the costs of doing so. Our analyses suggest that targeted farmers may play an important role in conservation, and they participate in conservation programs in different ways from other farmers.\nBy several measures, beginning and limited-resource farmers appear less likely to participate in EQIP relative to their prevalence in the farmer population as a whole. Targeting these farmers for participation could provide them with greater access to conservation program funding. In land retirement programs, the relationship is less clear. Relative to their proportion in the general farm population, a smaller proportion of farms operated by targeted farmers participated in CRP and WRP. The proportion of enrolled land controlled by these farmers, however, was similar to the proportion of all farmland they operate.\nUnderstanding participation patterns across working lands and land retirement programs is also important, particularly since the 2008 Farm Act increased funding for working-lands programs, but reduced the amount of land that could be enrolled in the CRP. If socially disadvantaged farmers are similar to beginning and limited-resource farmers and are less likely to enroll in EQIP, then a shift in conservation support to working-lands programs could reduce the overall access targeted farmers have to conservation funding. Data on socially disadvantaged farmer participation in EQIP would be needed to more defi nitively address this issue.\nSome evidence suggests that targeted farmers participating in conservation programs, as a group, may face more pressing environmental problems than other farmers. In the Delta region, beginning farmers may be able to provide more conservation benefi ts than other farmer types because they are more likely to farm more erodible land. Encouraging participation by such farmers in regions where this relationship holds could increase the environmental benefi ts provided by conservation programs.\nChoices about which environmental problems to address and which practices to adopt ultimately determine the benefi ts and costs of program participation. For example, limited-resource farmers are less likely to adopt practices in EQIP that address water quality problems, although they are more likely to be located in watersheds with impaired water quality. In CRP and WRP however, targeted farmers are concentrated in counties with more highly erodible cropland, and they are also concentrated in counties that provide the greatest expected levels of soil erosion reduction and water quality improvement benefi ts.\nWhile targeted farmers may provide more of some benefi ts, it is not clear that these farmers can provide benefi ts more cost effectively than other farmers. Beginning farmers in EQIP tended to receive larger payments per practice, to implement smaller practices, and to incur larger per acre practice costs for nutrient management (the most common management practice) relative to other farmers. Yet, beginning and limited-resource farmers adopt greater numbers of practices in EQIP, and they have increasingly adopted cost-shared structural practices in combination with management practices.\nResearch suggests that combinations of practices are more effective at providing environmental benefi ts than single practices, implying that, even if their treatment costs per acre are higher, beginning and limited-resource farmers are not necessarily providing fewer benefi ts than other farmers (Lerch et al., 2005; Berry et al., 2003) .\nProgram costs per enrolled acre in CRP and WRP were smaller for targeted farmers. If lower per acre payments in CRP/WRP imply that targeted farmers may provide environmental benefi ts more cost effectively, targeting enrollment in land retirement programs to these producers could increase program cost effectiveness. Our analysis of costs and the distribution of contracts relative to soil erodibility suggest a closer look at the issue may be warranted. Land retirement contract data that included identifi ers of farmer type along with benefi ts data could assess whether farmers with low-cost contracts generate the same or greater levels of benefi ts.\nDesigning programs to be broadly accessible can increase the fl exibility program managers have to achieve program goals cost effectively. Quantifying the environmental benefi ts generated by participating farmers would be needed to determine if targeting farmers (beginning, limited resource, or socially disadvantaged) provides benefi ts more cost effectively. 15 This analysis fi nds that these farmers participate in different ways than other farmers, leaving open the possibility that encouraging targeted farmers to enroll in conservation programs could result in tradeoffs with cost-effective provision of environmental benefi ts. These types of farmers, however, tend to operate fewer acres, so an important consideration is whether differences between these and other farmer types are due more to smaller farm size than to farmer type."}, {"section_title": "Appendix: Data Sources", "text": "This research relies on the observation of farmer and rancher participation in conservation programs and on the ability to distinguish between different types of farmers and ranchers.

Not all producers surveyed in ARMS receive the same questionnaire, so some information -including separate payments received for CRP and WRP participation -is available for only part of the surveyed population. For some analyses, the limited number of useable observations prevents analyses at regional or subregional scales.\n2. Operators with certain household characteristics may be undersampled in ARMS. Such undersampling may preclude statistically reliable conclusions about targeted farmers and ranchers in some cases (data in tables are notated where large coeffi cients of variation suggest that reliability is suspect).\n3.
