[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Implementation of amyloid biomarkers in clinical practice would be accelerated if such biomarkers could be measured in blood. We analyzed plasma levels of A\u03b242 and A\u03b240 in a cohort of 719 individuals (the Swedish BioFINDER study), including patients with subjective cognitive decline (SCD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia and cognitively healthy elderly, using a ultrasensitive immunoassay (Simoa platform). There were weak positive correlations between plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels for both A\u03b242 and A\u03b240, and negative correlations between plasma A\u03b242 and neocortical amyloid deposition (measured with PET). Plasma levels of A\u03b242 and A\u03b240 were reduced in AD dementia compared with all other diagnostic groups. However, during the preclinical or prodromal AD stages (i.e. in amyloid positive controls, SCD and MCI) plasma concentration of A\u03b242 was just moderately decreased whereas A\u03b240 levels were unchanged. Higher plasma (but not CSF) levels of A\u03b2 were associated with white matter lesions, cerebral microbleeds, hypertension, diabetes and ischemic heart disease. In summary, plasma A\u03b2 is overtly decreased during the dementia stage of AD indicating that prominent changes in A\u03b2 metabolism occur later in the periphery compared to the brain. Further, increased levels of A\u03b2 in plasma are associated with vascular disease.\nRecent clinical trials in Alzheimer's disease (AD) suggested that the success of new disease-modifying treatments critically depends on biomarkers that could reliably detect AD pathology already at prodromal stages 1 . Considerable progress has been made towards developing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 2 and brain imaging 3 biomarkers of AD. CSF \u03b2 -amyloid 42 (A\u03b2 42), the 42 amino acid isoform of A\u03b2 , and amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) have been established as the most specific biomarkers of amyloid deposition in the brain 2 . In sporadic AD, CSF A\u03b2 42 is reduced as early as 10-20 years before the onset of clinical symptoms 4, 5 .

In Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), plasma A\u03b2 fails to differentiate AD patients from control individuals and amyloid-positive from amyloid-negative individuals, although a weak positive relationship between plasma A\u03b2 40/A\u03b2 42 ratio and A\u03b2 ligand retention on PET was observed in APOE \u03b5 4-negative subjects only 14 . The Australian Imaging Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) research team have reported that plasma levels of either A\u03b2 40 or A\u03b2 42 do not associate with AD or neocortical A\u03b2 burden 15 . However, the A\u03b2 42/A\u03b2 40 ratio (note inverse ratio as compared to the ADNI results above) was slightly reduced in patients with AD and correlated inversely with amyloid burden as determined by amyloid PET.\nThe difficulties in getting consistent data could be, at least in part, related to poor performance and insufficient sensitivity of available analytical methods (mostly ELISA-based techniques) for adequate quantification of the minute amounts of A\u03b2 present in peripheral blood 9 . The recently developed ultrasensitive Simoa technology offers improved analytical sensitivity 16 that makes it suitable for measurements of AD-related biomarkers in serum and plasma 17 . In the present study, we measured plasma levels of A\u03b2 42 and A\u03b2 40 using Simoa assays in a cohort of 719 individuals including patients with subjective cognitive decline (SCD, n = 174), mild cognitive impairment (MCI, n = 214), AD (n = 57) and cognitively healthy elderly (n = 274). We combined plasma measurements with the analysis of CSF samples, amyloid PET, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and cognitive assessments in order to establish whether plasma A\u03b2 42 and A\u03b2 40 may be useful biomarkers of AD."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": "Study populations. All participants gave written informed consent to participate in the study. Ethical approval was given by the Ethical Committee of Lund University, Lund, Sweden and all the methods were carried out in accordance with the approved guidelines. [ The study population stemmed from three cohorts from the prospective and longitudinal Swedish BioFINDER study (www.biofinder.se). The first cohort consisted of 274 cognitively normal elderly participants who were recruited from the population-based Malm\u00f6 Diet Cancer study. Subjects were eligible for inclusion if they 1) were aged \u2265 60 years old, 2) scored 28-30 points on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) at the screening visit, 3) did not have cognitive symptoms as evaluated by a physician, 4) were fluent in Swedish, 5) did not fulfill the criteria of MCI or any dementia. The exclusion criteria were 1) presence of significant neurologic or psychiatric disease (e.g. stroke, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, major depression), 2) significant systemic illness making it difficult to participate, 3) refusing lumbar puncture and 4) significant alcohol abuse. Data was collected between 2009 and 2014 in accordance with a standardised protocol.\nIn the second cohort, 388 non-demented patients were enrolled consecutively at three memory outpatient clinics in Sweden. They were referred for assessment of cognitive complaints and evaluated by physicians with special interest in dementia disorders. Patients were included between 2010 and 2014. The inclusion criteria were: 1) referred to the memory clinics because of cognitive impairment; 2) not fulfilling the criteria for dementia; 3) an MMSE score of 24-30 points; 4) age 60-80 years and 5) fluent in Swedish. The exclusion criteria were: 1) cognitive impairment without doubt explained by another condition (other than prodromal dementia); 2) significant systemic illness making it difficult to participate, 3) refusing lumbar puncture and 4) significant alcohol abuse. Classification into SCD and MCI was based on a neuropsychological battery assessing the cognitive domains of verbal ability, visuospatial construction, episodic memory, executive functions and the clinical assessment by a senior neuropsychologist. These criteria resulted in a clinically relevant population where 45% were classified as SCD and 55% as MCI.\nIn the third cohort, we included 57 patients with AD at baseline, who were recruited consecutively at the Memory Clinic, Sk\u00e5ne University Hospital, Sweden between 2010 and 2014. The patients were assessed by a medical doctor specialized in dementia disorders. All cases met the DSM-IIIR criteria for dementia 18 as well as the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for AD 19 . The exclusion criteria were: 1) significant systemic illness making it difficult to participate and 2) significant alcohol abuse.\nIn all three cohorts, a medical doctor made the diagnosis of hypotension, diabetes and ischemic heart disease. Ischemic heart disease was defined as stable angina, unstable angina, and myocardial infarction. Thiazide diuretics, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, and beta blockers were categorized as anti-hypertensive/cardio-protective medications.\nPlasma and CSF sampling and analysis. Blood and CSF samples were collected on the same day and at the same time of day (plasma was obtained within 15 min of CSF sampling). For plasma collection, blood was drawn into tubes containing EDTA as anticoagulant. After centrifugation (2000 g, + 4 \u00b0C, 10 min), plasma samples were aliquoted into polypropylene tubes and stored at \u2212 80 \u00b0C pending biochemical analyses. Lumbar CSF samples were collected according to a standardized protocol 2, 20 . CSF samples were centrifuged (2000 g, + 4 \u00b0C, 10 min) after collection and aliquoted into polypropylene tubes followed by storage at \u2212 80 \u00b0C. The analysis of CSF followed the Alzheimer's Association Flow Chart for CSF biomarkers 2 . Plasma A\u03b2 42 and A\u03b2 40 were analyzed using ultrasensitive Simoa immunoassay (Quanterix, Lexington, MA, USA). In traditional sandwich ELISA of complex matrices such as plasma and serum, issues with spike recovery and lack of dilutional linearity (suggesting matrix interferences) have been reported 21, 22 . The ultrasensitivity of the Simoa assays, allowing dilution of the plasma/serum samples at 1:4 minimizes these matrix effects. The overall benefits of the Simoa assays are not only its high sensitivity and precision, but also the elimination of matrix interferences. The Simoa A\u03b2 40 and A\u03b2 42 assays both utilize the same capture antibody targeting the N-terminus of \u03b2 -amyloid and different C-terminus detection antibodies specific to A\u03b2 40 and A\u03b2 42. The A\u03b2 40 assay uses \u03b2 -amyloid (1-40) peptide from AnaSpec (AnaSpec, Fremont, CA, USA) as standard and the A\u03b2 42 assay uses the \u03b2 -amyloid (1-42) peptide from Covance (Covance Inc., Princeton, NJ, USA) as standard. For each assay, capture antibody was first covalently conjugated to magnetic particles utilizing a standard EDC coupling procedure and detection antibody was biotinylated. In the first step of the assay, antibody coated paramagnetic capture beads, biotinylated detection antibodies, and samples were combined, during which target molecules present in the sample were captured by the capture beads and labeled with the biotinylated detection antibodies. After washing, a conjugate of streptavidin-\u03b2 -galactosidase (S\u03b2 G) was mixed with the capture beads where S\u03b2 G bound to the biotin, resulting in enzyme labeling of captured target molecules. Following a second wash, the capture beads were resuspended in a resorufin \u03b2 -D-galactopyranoside (RGP) substrate solution and transferred to the Simoa array disc for detection 16 . All samples were diluted 4-fold for A\u03b2 42 and 8-fold for A\u03b2 40 using a proper sample diluent (PBS containing carrier protein and detergent) for measurement. The lower limit of detection (LLoD), defined as a concentration corresponding to a signal level of 2.5 SD above assay background, was 0.019 and 0.16 pg/mL for Simoa A\u03b2 42 and A\u03b2 40 assays, respectively. The lower of limit of quantification was 0.167 pg/ml for A\u03b2 42 (11% dose CV and 90% recovery) and 1.939 pg/mL for A\u03b2 40 (5% dose CV and 99% recovery). Mean spike recoveries of the Simoa A\u03b2 42 and A\u03b2 40 assays were 78.4% and 95.6%, respectively. Both Intra-assay (n = 3) and Inter-assay (n = 13) CVs were less than 10% for both assays. The average CV of measurement of A\u03b2 42 and A\u03b2 40 in all tested plasma samples during this study was 7% and 3%, respectively.\nCSF levels of A\u03b2 42 and A\u03b2 40 were analyzed with Euroimmun immunoassay (EUROIMMUN AG, L\u00fcbeck, Germany) 23, 24 in all study participants. This was done before the analysis of plasma samples using Simoa platform. Because CSF levels of A\u03b2 obtained with Simoa and Euroimmun immunoassays strongly correlated in a subset of 69 of patients, (A\u03b2 42, Pearson's r = 0.912; A\u03b2 40, Pearson's r = 0.913; all p < 0.001, Supplementary Fig. S1 25 . PET/CT scanning of the brain was conducted at two sites using the same type of scanner (Gemini, Philips Healthcare, Best, the Netherlands). Summed PET images from 90-110 min post injection representing the average uptake of [ 18 F]flutemetamol over this time were analyzed using NeuroMarQ software (provided by GE Healthcare, Cleveland, OH). A volume of interest (VOI) template was applied for the following 9 bilateral regions: prefrontal, parietal, lateral temporal, medial temporal, sensorimotor, occipital, anterior cingulate, posterior cingulate/precuneus and a global neocortical composite region 26 . The standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) was defined as the uptake in a VOI normalized for the mean cerebellar cortex uptake."}, {"section_title": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging.", "text": "A total of 620 individuals underwent MRI imaging including 266 control subjects, 161 SCD and 193 MCI patients.

The 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the slope estimates were calculated using bootstraping. RMA and all subsequent statistical analysis were adjusted for age and gender.

The effects of APOE genotype, CBM, hypertension, ischemic heart disease and anti-hypertensive/cardio-protective medications on plasma A\u03b2 levels were assessed with univariate general linear models additionally adjusting for diagnosis (with controls, SCD, MCI and AD as diagnostic categories). To test associations between plasma A\u03b2 and cognitive function (cognitive measures of global function (MMSE) or delayed memory recall (ADAS-cog item 3)) and WML we performed linear regression analysis also adjusting for diagnosis.

However, there were no differences in A\u03b2 42 levels between SCD or MCI patients and controls (Table 1) . Plasma levels of A\u03b2 40 were decreased in the AD group compared with controls (p < 0.001), SCD (p < 0.0001) and MCI (p < 0.0001) ( Fig. 2B ; Table 1 ). The A\u03b2 42/A\u03b2 40 ratio was lower in the MCI group than in control subjects (p = 0.002) and in AD patients compared with controls (p < 0.0001), SCD (p < 0.0001) and MCI (p = 0.003) ( Fig. 2C ; Table 1 ). The levels of A\u03b2 42 and A\u03b2 40 in CSF were found to be in agreement with existing data 6 ( Fig. 2D-F ; Table 1 ). We also compared diagnostic subgroups with pathological CSF signature (control-P, SCD-P, MCI-P, AD-P with CSF A\u03b2 42/A\u03b2 40 ratio \u2264 0.1) with control subjects showing normal CSF status (control-N with CSF A\u03b2 42/A\u03b2 40 ratio > 0.1).

Associations between plasma A\u03b2 and composite Plasma A\u03b2 and APOE4. Given that individuals with one or two APOE \u03b54 alleles have a several fold higher risk for AD and that CSF levels of A\u03b2 42 are affected by APOE genotype [29] [30] [31] we assessed the effects of APOE4 on plasma levels of the A\u03b2 isoforms.\nIn the total sample, APOE \u03b54 carriers showed lower levels of A\u03b2 42 (p < 0.001), A\u03b2 40 (p = 0.009) and lower A\u03b2 42/A\u03b2 40 ratio (p = 0.015) in plasma than non-carriers. When analyzed within individual diagnostic groups, plasma levels of A\u03b2 42 were decreased in APOE \u03b54 carriers in controls (p < 0.001) and SCD (p < 0.001), but not in MCI and AD dementia patients. There were no differences in A\u03b2 40 and the A\u03b2 42/A\u03b2 40 ratio between APOE \u03b54 carriers and non-carriers in any of the groups.\nPlasma A\u03b2 and cognitive function.

In addition, individuals with CMB (n = 51) showed higher plasma, but not CSF, A\u03b2 42/ A\u03b2 40 ratio (p = 0.005) than those without CMB (n = 569).\nFurther, plasma levels of A\u03b2 42 and A\u03b2 40 were increased in subjects with hypertension (A\u03b2 42, p = 0.002; A\u03b2 40, p = 0.002) (Fig. 4A-C) , ischemic heart disease (A\u03b2 42, p = 0.050; A\u03b2 40, p = 0.011) (Fig. 4D-F) and diabetes (A\u03b2 42, p = 0.006; A\u03b2 40, p< 0.001) (Fig. 4G-I (Fig. 4J-L) . Notably, we did not observe any changes in CSF A\u03b2 42 or A\u03b2 40 in relation to cardiovascular factors (Supplementary Fig. S3 ).\nThere were no associations between plasma A\u03b2 and smoking or hyperlipedmia.

We also demonstrate increased plasma levels of A\u03b2 were associated with WML, CMB, hypertension, diabetes and ischemic heart disease. Numerous previous studies investigated plasma levels of A\u03b2 42 and A\u03b2 40 in patients with prodromal AD and AD dementia using conventional ELISA 2, 9, 12, [32] [33] [34] . However, because of the inconsistency of the available data, it has been difficult to draw definite conclusions with respect to changes in plasma A\u03b2 concentration in AD. Heterogeneity of sample population, small sample size, confounding factors (in particular age) and insufficient analytical sensitivity for the ELISA methods are all thought to contribute to low reproducibility of the reported results 9 .

Using the Simoa platform and large cohorts of well-characterized patients and cognitively healthy controls, we found that plasma levels of A\u03b2 42 and A\u03b2 40 are decreased in AD whereas the plasma A\u03b2 42/A\u03b2 40 ratio is decreased in MCI and even more in AD. Although most of the previous investigations showed no differences in plasma A\u03b2 42 between AD patients and cognitively healthy controls 2, 12, 35 our data are in agreement with some studies demonstrating low plasma A\u03b2 42 and/or low plasma A\u03b2 42/A\u03b2 40 ratio in AD 15, 36 . Further, our results of decreased concentration of plasma A\u03b2 42 in APOE \u03b54 carriers compared with non-carriers are also consistent with earlier reports 12, 37 . We found reduced levels of A\u03b2 42 and the A\u03b2 42/A\u03b2 40 ratio in plasma of patients with preclinical and prodromal AD (e.g. cognitively healthy individuals, SCD and MCI patients with pathological CSF signature). However, the differences were small in comparison with a marked decline in CSF levels of A\u03b2 42 (Fig. 3) that is observed decades before the onset of clinical symptoms 4, 5 . These results indicate that AD pathology can be identified in CSF years before overt changes in peripheral blood. Other studies demonstrated that individuals with low plasma A\u03b2 42/A\u03b2 40 ratio (but not plasma A\u03b2 42) at baseline have a somewhat greater risk of future AD and that decrease in plasma A\u03b2 42 levels over time is linked to cognitive decline 10, 13 . Thus, the low plasma levels of A\u03b2 42 in AD patients could be due to the slow decline along the disease course.\nCSF A\u03b2 42 measurements and amyloid PET imaging are increasingly integrated in the clinical work-up of AD as biomarkers of amyloid pathology. However, development of less expensive and less invasive blood biomarkers that could predict CSF A\u03b2 42 and/or amyloid PET status will greatly facilitate widespread implementation of amyloid biomarkers in routine clinical practice. In the present study, we observed significant positive correlations between plasma and CSF concentrations for A\u03b2 42 and the A\u03b2 42/A\u03b2 40 ratio. Moreover, low plasma A\u03b2 42 and A\u03b2 42/A\u03b2 40 ratio were significantly associated with high total brain binding of [ 18 F] flutemetamol. Yet similar to previous reports, we found that both associations were relatively weak 12 . Furthermore, neither plasma A\u03b2 42 nor the plasma A\u03b2 42/A\u03b2 40 ratio showed sufficient accuracy to identify individuals with pathologic CSF signature or abnormal amyloid PET. Collectively, our findings suggest that blood A\u03b2 levels reflect only to some extent the dysregulated A\u03b2 metabolism and aggregation in the brain. Other factors that are unrelated to brain amyloid pathology might be modulating the peripheral levels of these peptides. First, A\u03b2 entering peripheral blood may be degraded by circulating enzymes or metabolized in the liver, which would reduce the potential to monitor brain A\u03b2 metabolism. Second, production outside the central nervous system by platelets, skeletal muscle cells and other cells types 38 probably contributes to the circulating pool of A\u03b2 . Consequently, while cerebral amyloid deposition is accompanied by a considerable decline in CSF A\u03b2 42 levels, the peripheral effects of plaque accumulation in the brain might be more diluted. Notably, we found decreased plasma levels of A\u03b2 40 in AD patients compared with cognitively healthy elderly, whereas in line with available evidence, no change was observed in CSF samples 2 . Altered levels of A\u03b2 have been shown in the skeletal muscle and liver of AD patients 38 indicating that AD-related changes in the periphery might affect plasma levels of A\u03b2 40 while the CSF levels remain unaltered.\nIn our study, elevated A\u03b2 42 and A\u03b2 40 in plasma, but not CSF, were associated with WMLs and the plasma, but not CSF, A\u03b2 42/A\u03b2 40 ratio was increased in individuals with CBM. Plasma A\u03b2 42 and A\u03b2 40 have been previously linked to WMLs in non-demented elderly as well as in AD and MCI patients 37, 39 . Increased plasma levels of A\u03b2 40 have also been described in individuals with infarctions in the ADNI study 12 . There are several potential mechanisms that could explain the association between plasma A\u03b2 and cerebrovascular pathology. Plasma A\u03b2 may affect endothelial cell function and vascular tone thereby leading to cerebral hypoperfusion that eventually results in WMLs 40 . Alternatively, reduced cerebral blood flow, which is an early clinical feature of AD 41 could promote overproduction of A\u03b2 in endothelial cells and its secretion into the circulation 42 . Increased production of A\u03b2 with marked increases in plasma levels are in fact found after severe ischemia due to cardiac arrest in patients that are resuscitated 43 . In this context it would be of interest to establish if vascular amyloid deposition in cerebral amyloid angiopathy is accompanied by altered blood levels of A\u03b2 42 and A\u03b2 40. Studies in small patient groups have so far produced inconclusive results and warranty future investigations [44] [45] [46] . Our finding also indicate that increased A\u03b2 42 and A\u03b2 40 in plasma, but not CSF, are associated with hypertension, diabetes and ischemic heart disease, conditions that adversely impact the function of the vascular system. This is in agreement with previous studies reporting association between plasma A\u03b2 and hypertension 12, 47 . Further, high plasma A\u03b2 40 has been recently linked to increased cardiovascular mortality in patients with coronary heart disease 48 .\nIn conclusion, we demonstrate that elevated plasma A\u03b2 is associated with vascular disease both in the brain and in the periphery. In AD, plasma A\u03b2 42 and A\u03b2 40 are markedly reduced during the dementia stages, which is in contrast to the CSF where there is a clear drop in A\u03b2 42, but not A\u03b2 40, already during preclinical stages. However, although low plasma A\u03b2 42 and A\u03b2 42/A\u03b2 40 ratio were associated with amyloid deposition in the brain, these markers did not show diagnostic value in AD. Several panels of plasma AD biomarkers have been recently reported 49, 50 . Future studies need to determine whether inclusion of plasma A\u03b2 measures might potentially improve the diagnostic performance of the plasma biomarker panels, especially during the dementia stage where we show a clear decrease in plasma A\u03b2 levels."}]
