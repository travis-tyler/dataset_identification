Methods: CSF was collected from 140 subjects with normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment, AD, and non-AD dementia. CSF levels of beta-amyloid 1-42 (Ab42), total Tau (t-Tau), and Tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (p-Tau181) were analyzed following the standard and modified protocols. CSF levels of apoJ, apoE, albumin, and a-synuclein were measured in a subgroup (n = 69), and their effects on measured AD biomarker levels were also determined in vitro using human CSF samples. Results: CSF Ab42 levels measured using the AD Neuro-imaging Initiative (ADNI) protocol (which we call suspended Ab42 or susAb) were lower than total measurable CSF Ab42 in all groups, and on average represents 57% of the latter. Logistic regression analysis showed this proportion (% susAb) to be directly correlated with CSF Ab42 and apoJ levels, but inversely correlated with CSF t-Tau levels. Finally, we showed in vitro that increasing apoE and apoJ levels directly increased % susAb. Conclusion: CSF susAb levels are influenced by biological and technical factors, and may represent a marker of Ab susceptible to lipoprotein-mediated clearance.

[1] [2] [3] Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of b-amyloid 1-42 (Ab42), total tau (T-tau), and tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (p-tau 181 ) represent such biomarkers, and altered levels of these biomarkers are highly associated with future conversion to dementia due to AD pathology. [4] [5] [6] Studies using antemortem CSF samples from subjects followed longitudinally to autopsy showed that CSF Ab42 is sensitive for AD, 7, 8 CSF t-Tau is specific for AD, and the ratio of CSF t-Tau to Ab42 (t-Tau/Ab42) appears to strike a balance between sensitivity and specificity. Despite ongoing international standardization efforts, 9 ,10 variability in measured biomarker levels persists even after accounting for reagent-related factors. It remains also unclear why subtle interoperator differences can result in significant measurement imprecision. During a two-site standardization process, we discovered that CSF Ab42 measured using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuro-imaging Initiative (ADNI) protocol captures only a fraction of the total measurable CSF Ab42, and this apparent Ab42 is further influenced by technical factors and other CSF proteins implicated in AD. [11] [12] [13] We then identified values equivalent to published ADNI thresholds for diagnosis based on processing techniques, and experimentally determined how Ab-binding proteins directly influenced the relative measured Ab42 levels.

Total measurable CSF Ab42 levels were significantly higher than those measured using the ADNI protocol (Fig. 1A) , which led us to test manipulations which can potentially replicate (centrifuge) this difference. In keeping with our hypothesis, Ab42 levels were indistinguishable between the ADNI and centrifuge protocols. Because ADNI samples were never centrifuged, we considered the CSF Ab42 levels from these two protocol to reflect the pool of Ab42 that remains suspended (susAb) in solution after table-top incubation (at room temperature) or centrifugation (Fig. 2) . Using the entire cohort of subjects (n = 140, Table 1 ), susAb levels, on average, represented 57.0% of total Ab42 levels (SD = 16.6%, P < 0.001), and correlated moderately with total measurable Ab42 levels (R = 0.818, P < 0.001, Fig. 3 ). Subjects with clinical AD had lower % susAb than subjects with normal cognition, MCI, or non-AD dementia (P < 0.017 by Mann-Whitney U-test, Fig. 1B ). This association persisted (F = 9.235, P = 0.003) even when adjusting for age, gender, and total Ab42.

Paired T-tests also showed suspended t-Tau and pTau 181 levels to be lower than total measurable t-Tau and p-Tau 181 levels (P < 0.001 for both), but the difference in levels (15.3 AE 16.5% for t-Tau, 12.4 AE 20.9% for p-Tau 181 ) is much smaller than that seen for Ab42 and there was no difference across clinical categories. Thus, we hereafter focused on susAb and factors which influence this measure.

To determine which candidate CSF proteins influence % susAb, we first determined whether susAb levels were influenced by levels of other proteins implicated in AD (apoE, apoJ, a-synuclein, and total protein) in a smaller cohort (n = 69). The four diagnostic groups did not differ in levels of apoE (P = 0.919), apoJ (P = 0.724), a-synuclein (P = 0.629), and total protein (P = 0.833). Linear multivariate regression analysis showed that while total measurable CSF Ab42 levels were only correlated with MCI or AD diagnosis, susAb levels were also influenced by levels of apoJ and t-Tau (Table 2) . Similarly, % susAb was most associated with apoJ (F = 26.5, P < 0.001) and t-Tau (F = 16.0, P < 0.001) levels, even when age, gender, diagnosis, disease duration, and CSF biomarker (Ab42, p-Tau 181 , apoE, a-synuclein, and total protein) levels were entered into the model.

We observe in a large cohort that the difference between total measurable and susAb is most strongly associated with CSF apoJ and t-Tau levels, and % susAb can be manipulated by increasing levels of apoJ and apoE. As CSF % susAb is influenced by AD-related and AD-unrelated factors, we propose that apparent susAb is a much more complex measure than total measurable CSF Ab42 and does not directly represent the total Ab42 abundance.\nReproducible measurements of CSF AD biomarkers, especially Ab42, have been a major challenge in their translation to clinical use. 10 As we report here, seemingly minute differences in standard operating procedures can result in large differences in the measured biomarker levels. Since CSF AD biomarkers are already susceptible to preanalytical factors such as diurnal variation 29 and collection tube material, 30 it was not surprising that preanalytical protocol variations following lumbar puncture can result in approximately twofold difference in Ab42 levels. The biggest alterations in Ab42 levels may have come from the standard freeze-thawing cycle universally applied to biomarker studies. Because clinical trials targeting Ab clearance or production measure susAb levels 31, 32 to determine whether there is global Ab reduction and have unknown effects on Ab-binding proteins, we propose that total measurable Ab42 levels better reflect total Ab42 \"load\" than susAb.\nSusAb levels were previously associated with cerebral amyloid deposition, hippocampal atrophy, and longitudinal cognitive decline, and the strong correlation between suspended and total Ab42 suggests that total Ab42 would have the same predictive power. At the same time, the reduction in CSF Ab42 level is further accentuated by AD diagnosis and increased CSF t-Tau levels, which may make CSF susAb42 a more clinically useful diagnostic marker despite its \"non-physiologic\" nature. Because % susAb is associated with increasing levels of Ab-binding proteins, susAb may represent the pool of protein-bound peptides available for lipoprotein-mediated clearance. The association between increasing apoE, apoJ, and albumin levels with higher % susAb at 37\u00b0C is in keeping with the observation of higher susAb without freeze-thawing than with freezing, and suggests that Ab42 may lose its physiologic interaction with its binding proteins after freezing and may be more prone to aggregation. 33 With the duration of vortex representing the major difference between ADNI and Vortex protocols, this binding likely is promoted by prolonged vigorous vortexing. Vigorous vortexing prior to plate loading likely promotes this protein-protein interaction, and the interaction is likely saturable as nonphysiologic levels of apoE and apoJ could not bring % susAb to 100%. If apoE-directed therapy 34, 35 is used in AD with or without Ab-directed therapies, the most robust biomarker profile would then consist of susAb, total measurable Ab, as well as t-Tau, apoE, and apoJ rather than any single biomarkers alone.\nThis study has a number of limitations. Very few of the 140 subjects had autopsy confirmation or amyloid imaging, which makes it challenging for us to derive autopsycorrelated biomarker cut-off values beyond those which correspond to previously reported values. 28 We did not determine the influence of exact timing of day on % susAb. We only measured a subset of abundant Ab42 interacting proteins, and other CSF proteins may alter % susAb ratios in parallel to or in conjunction with apoJ and apoE. We did not provide direct evidence that exogenous apoE or apoJ directly bound to CSF Ab42 to enhance its solubility, even though apolipoproteins are known to interact with Ab and may prevent its aggregation 22, 33, 36, 37 We also did not use gamma-secretase inhibitors to account for de novo production of Ab42 peptides, but gamma-secretase activity has not been reported in CSF and presenilin 1 and 2 fragments detected in CSF are felt to represent nonspecific aggregation rather than gamma-secretase complexes. 38 We propose that alterations in CSF % susAb are due to technical and biological factors, and susAb42 levels, t-Tau/susAb42 ratio, as well as their impact on other biological correlates of AD should be interpreted with care because these in vitro measures reflect amyloid protein's total abundance as well as its dynamic interactions with other AD-associated proteins and AD itself. addition, Dr. Shaw has a patent CSF Alzheimer's Biomarkers pending, and a patent Amyloid diagnostic imaging with royalties paid to Amyvid.
