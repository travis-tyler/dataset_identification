[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has created an unprecedented global demand for rapid diagnostic testing. Most countries are employing reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) for confirmation of infection [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . Consequently, a global shortage of RNA extraction kits as well as RT-qPCR assay kits and their associated reagents has ensued [8] [9] [10] . Therefore, alternative diagnostics not dependent on these commonly used materials are required. First described 20 years ago by Notomi et al., the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay is robust, rapid and straightforward, yet retains high sensitivity and specificity [11] . These features have seen the LAMP assay and the inclusion of a reverse transcriptase (RT-LAMP) implemented for a broad range of molecular diagnostic applications extending from infectious diseases, including detection of the original SARS-CoV-1 virus [12] , bacteria and parasites [13] [14] [15] to cancer [16] . The advantages of RT-LAMP include using different reagents than RT-qPCR, the potential for direct processing of samples without the need for prior RNA extraction and an extremely rapid turn-around time. Several groups have now described different RT-LAMP assays for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] .\nIn this study, we developed a RT-LAMP assay that targets the CDC N1 region of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid gene (N-gene) [3] and used a commercial mastermix from Opti-Gene. This mix contains a proprietary reverse transcriptase for cDNA synthesis and the thermophilic GspSSD stranddisplacing polymerase/reverse transcriptase for DNA amplification ( www. optigene. co. uk) with a dsDNA intercalating fluorescent dye. Detection was achieved by measuring the increase in fluorescence as amplification products accumulate. The N1 gene Single Tube Optigene LAMP assay (hereafter called N1-STOP-LAMP) was assessed for the direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, following FDA Policy for Diagnostic Tests for Coronavirus Disease-2019 during the Public Health Emergency against the four parameters and acceptance criteria summarized in the following reference [5] . Validation samples were human upper respiratory tract specimens, collected using nasopharyngeal flocked swabs stored in universal transport media (UTM)."}, {"section_title": "Specimen collection and handling", "text": "Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected by qualified healthcare professionals from patients meeting the epidemiological and clinical criteria as specified by the Victorian Department of Health and Human Services at the time of swab collection [1] between the 23 March [8] and 4 April 2020.

Samples were collected at metropolitan hospitals in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, and transported to the Doherty Institute Public Health Laboratories for further testing as per World Health Organization recommendations [6] . All swabs were processed in a class II biological safety cabinet."}, {"section_title": "Cell culture and SARS-CoV-2 RNA extraction", "text": "Vero cells (within 30 passages from the original American Type Culture Collection [ATCC] stock) were maintained in Minimal Essential Media (MEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated foetal bovine serum (FBS), 10 \u00b5M HEPES, 2 mM glutamine and antibiotics. Cell cultures were maintained at 37 \u00b0C in a 5% CO 2 incubator. All virus infection cultures were conducted within the High Containment Facilities in a PC3 laboratory at the Doherty Institute. To generate stocks of SARS-CoV-2, confluent Vero cell monolayers were washed once with MEM without FBS (infection media) then infected with a known amount SARS-CoV-2 virus originally isolated from a patient [25] . After 1 h incubation at 37 \u00b0C in a 5% CO2 incubator to enable virus binding, infection media containing 1 mg ml \u22121 TPCK-trypsin was added, and flasks returned to the incubator. After 3d incubation and microscopic confirmation of widespread cytopathic effect (CPE), the supernatants were harvested, and filter sterilized through a 0.45 \u00b5m syringe filter. To assess infectious SARS-CoV-2 viral titres, both Tissue Culture Infectious Dose 50 (TCID 50 ) and plaque assays were performed. Briefly, serial dilutions of the stock virus were added to washed monolayers of Vero cells. After 1 h incubation to allow virus to adhere, for the TCID 50 assay, infection media containing 1 \u00b5g ml \u22121 TPCK-Trypsin was added, while for the plaque assay the infected cell monolayer was overlaid with Leibovitz-15 (L15) media supplemented with 0.9% agarose (DNA grade, Sigma), antibiotics and 2 \u00b5g ml \u22121 TPCK Trypsin. After 3d incubation, the dilution of stock required to cause CPE in at least 50% of wells (TCID 50 ) was determined via back calculation of microscopic confirmation of CPE in wells for a given dilution. For quantitation via plaque assay, plaques present in the monolayer were macroscopically visualized, individually counted and back calculated for each given dilution to determine the number of p.f.u. per ml in the original stock. Stocks of SARS-CoV-2 used by this study had a TCID 50 of 5.4\u00d710 5 ml \u22121 and plaque assay gave 9.78\u00d710 5 p.f.u. ml \u22121 . To heat inactivate the virus, 200 \u00b5l of neat stock was heated to 60 \u00b0C for 30 min, then cooled. Inactivation was confirmed via complete lack of CPE and plaque formation using both TCID 50 and plaque assays. To prepare SARS-CoV-2 RNA from stocks, 500 \u00b5l aliquots were thawed and RNA extracted using the RNeasy mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's specifications, with an elution volume of 50 \u00b5l.

This was indicated by an absolute detection threshold between 50 and 500 viral genome copies per reaction. We achieved a reliable detection of 5/5 replicates at 500 viral genome copies and detection of 4/5 replicates at 50 viral genome copies per reaction (Fig. 1a) . Of note, this threshold is likely an underestimate of the true detection limit, as we assumed all RNA yielded from the viral stock generated from the Vero cell supernatant was of viral origin.

Sterile UTM had no impact on N1-STOP-LAMP (data not shown). However, the nasopharyngeal secretions in patient samples were observed to be inhibitory. Most pronounced when 5 \u00b5l of patient sample was used as the direct RNA template (Fig. 1b) , but relieved at a 1/5 dilution of the patient sample, thus 5 \u00b5l of a 1/5 dilution of the patient sample or a 1 \u00b5l of neat patient sample was selected as the optimum template volume for N1-STOP-LAMP (Fig. 2a) . Experiments were also conducted using dry swabs eluted in PBS. We tested elution in 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 ml and found that an elution volume of 1.5 ml of PBS was a good compromise between unnecessary dilution of potential virus in the sample and sufficient dilution to alleviate assay inhibition (data not shown). To reduce the risk associated with handling clinical specimens containing infectious SARS-CoV-2, we also assessed the impact of a heat inactivation step on detection sensitivity.

This has required massively upscaled SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic capabilities. Particularly, a worldwide focus on developing improved technologies [29] . There have been more than 20 molecular tests recently receiving FDA Emergency Use Authorisations (EUAs) [5] . In this current study, we demonstrate the potential of N1-STOP-LAMP. We focused efforts on the LAMP assay because it has been previously employed for the rapid and robust detection of numerous RNA viruses including Zika, Chikungunya, Influenza and SARS-CoV-1 [12, [30] [31] [32] [33] and was of great assistance during these outbreaks, particularly in resource constrained settings. Advantages of LAMP testing include rapid turnaround time, ease of implementation, non-standard reagent use and potential utility at point of care [19] [20] [21] . To date, there has been limited detail on the performance characteristics of emerging RT-LAMP-based tests in head-to-head comparisons with Table 2 . Comparison of N1-STOP-LAMP and RT-qPCR performance using titred virus diluted in universal transport medium Here we have shown the specific detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA directly from clinical swabs without the need for RNA purification, using a LAMP assay targeting the N1 region of the SARS-CoV-2 N-gene in conjunction with the reverse transcriptase/GspSSD LF DNA polymerase mastermix from OptiGene. With a detection limit of 54 TCID 50 ml \u22121 the N1-STOP-LAMP assay met each of the four FDA criteria for EUA. Based on reported data, as opposed to head-tohead comparisons, the N1-STOP-LAMP detection limit is higher than several recently reported FDA-EUA COVID-19 tests. Expressed as virus copies per ml the N1-STOP-LAMP LoD is estimated at 54 000 virus copies per ml (assumes our TCID 50 underestimates virus copy number by 1000-fold, see Methods), compared to Cepheid GeneXpert Xpress 250 virus copies per ml or Abbott ID NOW COVID-19 test 125 virus copies per ml. Other EUA assays reporting LoDs similar to N1-STOP-LAMP include the Luminex ARIES SARS-CoV-2 assay (75 000 copies per ml) and the GenMark ePlex SARS-CoV-2 test (100 000 copies per ml). Given these performance metrics, and the test's high positive predictive value (100 %), we see N1-STOP-LAMP as well suited for widespread screening of large populations when COVID-19 prevalence is low. N1-STOP-LAMP could be used in large-scale, national testing programs to support aggressive COVID-19 contact tracing and disease suppression or elimination activities. The test could also play a role in near-point-of-care settings, such as outbreak investigation in hospitals and nursing homes, providing rapid-turnaround-time of results for health-care workers and highly vulnerable patients. The relatively simple assay format of N1-STOP-LAMP is also suitable for deployment in lower and middle-income countries, where access to sophisticated laboratory infrastructure is limited.\nDuring this evaluation we noted opportunities for improvement of N1-STOP-LAMP. We observed that although 1 \u00b5l of UTM was tolerated in the OptiGene RT-LAMP formulation, larger quantities of sample matrix (UTM or PBS containing additional human material from the nasopharyngeal swab) were inhibitory to the RT-LAMP reaction. If more than 1 \u00b5l of spiked (purified virus or RNA as template) sample matrix was used in the assay, no amplification was observed (Fig. 1b) . However, under ideal conditions (i.e. no sample inhibition from human components), the impact of using an increased template volume was shown, where 5 \u00b5l of UTM added directly to the N1-STOP-LAMP reaction was equal to the sensitivity of using purified RNA (Fig. 2b) . Furthermore, addition of a simple RNA purification step, that does not require commercial kits, improved the detection sensitivity of N1-STOP-LAMP to rival RT-qPCR. Our follow-up of five false-negative results ( Table 4 , Fig. 3c) , demonstrated the feasibility of including a simple, scalable and rapid magnetic-bead RNA purification step [26] , with which we were able to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA with N1-STOP-LAMP in 4/5 UTM specimens that had previously tested negative by the assay (Table S3) . Other opportunities for improvement include the use of specific fluorescent probes to detect amplification products, thus facilitating multiplex reactions and the inclusion of an internal amplification control within each test [24, 34] .\nAs mentioned, recognized strengths of the LAMP assay include the rapid time to test result, with the majority of the positive clinical samples yielding a result in under 15 min, and the robust test format, testing directly from the swab eluate. Our preferred specimen type for N1-STOP-LAMP is a dry nasopharyngeal swab. Detailed examination of optimum swabs for the detection of influenza and other RNA viruses has shown dry swabs offer superior performance [35] . In the current study we have shown that N1-STOP-LAMP has satisfactory performance using dry swabs eluted in 1.5 ml of PBS (Fig. 3b) ; a format that potentially doubles the effective concentration of virus in the sample compared to 3 ml of UTM in the Copan format. Another strength of N1-STOP-LAMP is that the assay readily scales from small sample numbers (e.g. 8-well with portable detection unit) to high throughput (run with sample robotics and 96-well thermocyclers in a centralized laboratory).\nWhile establishing the assay, we noted susceptibility to contamination that was easily addressed by the standard precautions used to prevent template carryover for any nucleic acid amplification test, such as physical separation of mastermix preparation from sample inoculation; not opening post-amplification reaction tubes or plates; and inclusion of negative extraction controls. Addition of uracil-N-glycosylase has been reported as a strategy to limit the risk of amplicon contamination, however this is associated with a loss of detection sensitivity [36] .\nIn this report we have shown N1-STOP-LAMP is a robust diagnostic test for the specific and rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2. It is an alternative molecular test for SARS-CoV-2 that can be readily and seamlessly deployed, particularly when access to standard RT-qPCR-based approaches are limited. "}]
