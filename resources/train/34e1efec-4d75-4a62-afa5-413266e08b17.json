[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Prescription drug safety is a growing, yet undermanaged health issue. There has been a 24% increased risk of adverse drug reactions for older adults (1), and a 3000% increase in fatal medication errors related to alcohol and illicit drug use between 1983 and 2004 in the US, more so than deaths from either medication or alcohol/illicit drug use alone (2). Possible explanations for this increased risk of adverse drug events is the increase in older adults with concomitant use of alcohol and medications (3,4) the decreased medication metabolism with aging (5), and older adults being the highest consumers of medications (6). For instance, approximately 60% of adults use medications by age 60, nearing 90% by 80 years (7), and recent estimates indicating that among adults 65 years and older, 90% take at least one, 65% take three or more, and 39% take five or more prescription drugs (8) Additionally, 77% of 65+ years medication users take at least one alcohol-interactive medication (9). Alcohol consumption is also fairly common with more than half of individuals report consuming alcohol in the past 30 days, 70% in the past year (10,11), and almost 88% reporting the consumption of alcohol in their lifetime (12). Excessive drinking is also fairly common in older adults, with almost 25% of older women and 50% of older men drinking above recommended drinking thresholds of 1+ drinks/day (13). Additionally, the risk of adverse alcohol events increase after the age of 50, due to decreases in gastric alcohol dehydrogenase, leading to raised blood alcohol concentrations in middle and old age (14,15). For instance, it has been estimated that older adults are hospitalized for alcoholrelated complications as often as for myocardial infarctions (16) Furthermore, approximately half of 65+ year-old drinkers are consuming alcohol while also taking an alcohol interaction medication (17,18), with one-third consuming alcohol while having an alcohol sensitive condition (19). The combination of alcohol and medications can lead to: a) compromised medical treatment, b) injuries and negative health complexities (i.e., falls, cognitive impairment), and c) fatalities; thereby increasing morbidity, mortality, and health costs for older adults (2,20,21). Additionally, medication overdoses in older adults have been commonly associated with alcohol (22). Further concern comes from expected increases in drinking rates among future aging cohorts due to higher reported use of substances compared to earlier cohorts (23). Such evidence lends support for the need to better understand recent trends of concurrent alcohol and medication (alcohol/medication) health incidents in aging adults. The development of programming to prevent concurrent alcohol/medication health incidents is considered a rural health priority (24), and aging adults who reside in rural areas are considered to be at highest risk of experiencing prescription drug misuse (25). This study sought to explore rural/urban differences due to existing evidence indicating rural health differences based on limited resources and accessibility (2628) greater burden of disease (29,30), and the rural culture of independence (31). In the present study, Kentucky hospital records were analyzed over time to: (a) estimate concurrent alcohol/medication hospitalization rates; (b) compare alcohol/medication hospitalization rates between urban and rural settings; (c) compare alcohol/medication hospitalization rates by age cohort between middle-aged (50-64 years) and older adults (65+ years) due to differences in health status and medication use. Greater concurrent alcohol/medication hospitalization rate increases are expected in older adults due to their greater medication use, and among rural adults due to their increased risks for medication misuse. Kentucky is an appropriate setting to explore alcohol/medication incidents, because it has a 12% prevalence rate for heavy/binge drinking, 29% of driving deaths involving alcohol, and a rate of 20 drug poisoning deaths per 100,000 population (32). Additionally, 14.4% of the state population is 65+ years of age, only slightly more than the 14.1% 2013 US Census estimate (33). The near balanced population distribution among rural (46%) and urban (54%) that exists in the state of Kentucky (34) was examined to explore regional differences. Alcohol/medication hospitalization prevention is especially important in the 54 Appalachian counties (out of 120) in Kentucky, where prescription drug abuse is among the highest in the nation (35)."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study Design and Data Source", "text": "In the present study, Kentucky hospital records were analyzed over time to: (a) estimate concurrent alcohol/medication hospitalization rates; (b) compare alcohol/medication hospitalization rates between urban and rural settings; (c) compare alcohol/medication hospitalization rates by age cohort between middle-aged (50-64 years) and older adults (65+ years). Kentucky inpatient hospital discharge uniform billing electronic records for state residents 50 years and older treated in Kentucky non-federal, acute care facilities from 2001 to 2012 were analyzed. Annual alcohol/medication hospitalization rates were calculated based on the actual count of alcohol/medication hospitalization occurrences (episodes of care) that year per 100,000 corresponding population (according to 2001-2012 census estimates (36)). All personal identifiers were removed from the data by the maintaining agency prior to receipt, as per human subjects approval. The data were coded using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) (37). For each episode of care, the data contained a principal diagnosis, up to 24 secondary diagnoses, and three designated external-cause-of-injury (E-code) fields.

However, to our knowledge there were no medical record data obtained that contains this exact collective diagnostic information. Based on previous research (38,39) an operational definition was adapted where a concurrent alcohol/medication case was classified as 1) any diagnosis of medication drug poisoning (ICD-9-CM codes 960-979) {excluding poisoning by illicit drugs (965.00, 965.01, 968.5, 969.6, 970.81)}; AND 2) at least one of the following alcohol diagnoses: toxic effect of ethyl alcohol (980.0), excessive blood level of alcohol (790.3), alcohol dependence syndrome (303), alcohol abuse (305.0), or alcohol withdrawn delirium (291.0). Because these are independent diagnoses, no causality can be confirmed; there is no data indicating whether the alcohol caused the medication poisoning, or the medication use causing the alcohol poisoning. As defined in the Injury Surveillance Workgroup on Poisoning's consensus recommendations, medication drug poisoning are considered overdose injuries (40) and were classified by intent based on a listed medication overdose Ecode in the range E850-E858 (unintentional); E950.0-E950.5 (self-harm); E962.0 (assault); and E980.0-E980.5 (undetermined) with medication (substance) involved during poisoning event."}, {"section_title": "Age", "text": "Groups-This study sought to compare rates by age cohort between middleaged (50-64 years) and older adults (65+ years).

Examining rural-urban differences, findings indicated that there was a 220.00% increase in alcohol/medication hospitalizations from 2001 (n=35) to 2012 (n=112) in older rural adults; a smaller increase of 171.01% was found for urban adults (2001: n=69; 2012: n=187). When comparing the annual crude rates, older rural adults experienced a 162.32% increase from 2001 (6.37 per 100,000) to 2012 (16.71 per 100,000), while older urban adults experienced a 102.15% increase (11.16 per 100,000 in 2001 and 22.56 per 100,000 in 2012).

The increase was seen in both 50-64 aged adults with a 112% increase and 159% increase in the 65+ aged adults, with aged 50-64 year olds having 4.6 times the estimated rate of those aged 65+. The characteristics of the hospitalizations were chiefly medication poisonings, selfharm intent in middle-agers and accidental intent in older adults, with the involvement of benzodiazepines. There were increases over time in both rural and urban regions, with greater increase in the rural regions despite lower overall rates. Greater increases in rural areas and the 65+ aged adults were noted, yet there were higher rates in urban and 50-64 aged adults. This increase is similar to those identified in past studies examining national samples (2,38). Unique to this study was a focus on aging adults with the exclusion of an illicit drug use; accordingly the study results are focused on medication drug poisonings in middle and older adults. This evidence indicates a great need to address and prevent concurrent alcohol/medication incidents in hospital and community settings, and developing and using evidence based interventions in the area of alcohol and medication management. This case is particularly true for middle-agers that are aging into old age, as this study indicates that greater prevalence of alcohol/medication hospitalizations. While the objective of the current study was not to identify causal mechanisms of alcohol/ medication hospitalization rate change, the growth in alcohol/medication hospitalizations can be conceptually explained by 1) continuous alcohol consumption across the lifespan; 2) the aging of the baby boomers, with more liberal substance use behaviors; and 3) increased medication use with age. Specifically, research has indicated that alcohol consumption continues through old age despite guidelines to decrease drinking with age and disease onset, to no more than no more 1 drink per day (43). Also with the aging of the baby boomers comes a stronger culture of substance use including alcohol use (44). Another possible contributor to the growth of alcohol/medication hospitalizations, is the increase in medication use with aging without a matching increase in medication safety measures (6,7). The rise in alcohol/medication hospitalizations make the case for increased public health attention and interventions to promote alcohol and medication safety in aging adults. Increased medication and regular alcohol use have not translated into medication safety health promotion priorities (45). Consequently, another explanation for the alcohol/ medication hospitalization growth can be a result of limited knowledge about the dangers of combined alcohol and medication use (45). A medication safety health promotion campaign should address this issue by focusing on the health risks and outcomes associated with combined alcohol and medication use, including how alcohol consumption reduces medication compliance (46,47). In the US, the need for increased alcohol use screenings and medication instructions provided by pharmacists has been acknowledged when prescribing alcohol-interacting medications (21,48) The growth in alcohol/medication hospitalizations can also be conceptually explained as a plausible mental health treatment crisis as indicated by mental disorders being the second most common identified principal diagnoses with self-harm being the most frequent intention in this study for middle-agers. For middle and older adults, mental illness can be particularly detrimental because it is under recognized, misrepresented, and under treated (49). Only half of all patients needing psychiatric treatment actively engage in recommended treatment regimens, and consequently experience increased morbidity and mortality, including suicide (50). Furthermore, alcohol and medications are often used to self-medicate underlying mental illness (51). There is also evidence that rural residents with a mental health disorder are at increased likelihood of also meeting criteria for a substance use disorder (52). Addressing mental health in rural areas is however challenging due to limitations in formal and informal medical care, including mental health management resources (53). In this context, there is a need for an increased focus on promoting high quality treatment and community living for individuals experiencing mental health issues in both rural and urban areas to prevent alcohol/medication hospitalization growth. These results indicate that alcohol/medication hospitalizations have dramatically increased across middle and older adults in both rural and urban communities, however findings in this study need to be considered within some limitations. The results were based only on cases within Kentucky. However, research conducted in Kentucky is generalizable to at least 16.6 million Americans who also reside in similar Appalachian environments (54). Another limitation to consider is that the statistical analysis assumed independence of observations, which may not necessarily be the case because the study dataset only recorded number of occurrences, not the number of unique individuals. Future research needs to track validated unique individuals to verify the current results (55). Also as a caveat of the analysis, the study database only obtained up to nine diagnoses prior to 2005 and up to 25 diagnoses from 2005 forward. Therefore, data from 2001-2004 may have been underreported compared to 2005-2012 data. This underreporting in the earlier years could considerably contribute to the apparent increased alcohol/medication hospitalization rates, however graphic trends between 2005-2012 continued to show increasing trajectories. Also, the study analysis combined intentional with unintentional poisoning in the analysis. Future research should consider separately analyzing and comparing the risk factors within a larger database. Separate analysis for intentional with unintentional poisoning could also better explain the source of the increase. For example, a greater increase in intentional could indicate a mental health crisis and a greater increase in unintentional could indicate an educational/training problem. Finally there was no estimate of alcohol intake other than a diagnosis of alcohol morbidity in the current study. To obtain a more accurate understanding of alcohol and medication interactions future research should collect concurrent alcohol behaviors. Furthermore, to better understand trends, future research should examine causality between alcohol and medication poisoning, and compare concurrent trends between alcohol/medication hospitalization vs. alcohol and medication independent poisoning trends for middle-aged and older adults. In conclusion, there is a growing wave of hospitalizations in Kentucky involving concurrent alcohol/medication use among adults aged 50 years and older. As a result, there is a need for interventions that can reduce alcohol and medication interactions in middle and older adults, particularly those adults that reside in rural regions. Future research needs to explore the increase in alcohol and medication use nationally and globally in aging adults, while considering more diverse populations, using unique individual cases, and developing, evaluating, and disseminating effective interventions across rural and urban areas to combat concurrent alcohol/medication health incidents.
