Multiple research and policy objectives are addressed through the NELS:88 design. The study is intended to produce a general purpose dataset to develop and evaluate educational policy at all government levels. NELS:88 aims to infonn decision makers, education practitioners, and parents about the changes in the operation of the educational system over time and the effects of various elements of the system on the lives of the individuals who pass through it. Specifically, NELS:88 focuses on a number of interrelated policy issues, including: students' academic growth over time, and the family, community, school, and classroom factors that promote or inhibit student learning; the transition of different types of students from eighth grade to secondary school; the influence of ability grouping and differential course-taking opportunities on future educational experiences and outcomes; determinants and consequences of dropping out of (and of returning to) the educational system; changes in educational practices over time; the role of the school in helping students at risk of school failure, and the school experiences and academic performance of language-minority students; the nansition from school to work; and postsecondary access, choice, and persistence. A Profile of the American High School Senior in 1992 A detailed description of the NCES National Education Longitudinal Studies program, and of the design and history of NELS:88, is provided in Appendix A of this report. Analytic Levels: Across-Wave, Within-Wave, and Across Cohort Analyses NELS:88 was designed to support cross-wave or longitudinal analysis; within-wave or crosssectional analysis; and trend analysis, based on cross-cohort comparisons of within-wave NELS:88 data with results from earlier studies. In addition, NELS:88 data can be used either descriptively (for example, one can describe what changes 1988 eighth graders had undergone by their senior year), or relationally, (for example, one might try to account for why certain changes had taken place). A descriptive analysis might tell us how many seniors were enrolled in spring term 1992, how much course work the average senior had completed, or what proportion of different racial/ethnic subgroups were proficient in higher level mathematical operations. The focus of this report is primarily descriptive. However, a more sophisticated analysis, which may be undertaken with longitudinal data, might model the process through which some change occurred such as gains in achievement as measured by the NELS:88 cognitive test battery. In longitudinal analysis, whether descriptive or analytic changes from the 1988 baseline are measured 22 or 4 years later, or 1990 sophomores may be re-examined two years later. Longitudinal analysis typically involves repeated measures of the same outcome. (For example, test data can be used to measure growth in academic achievement over time; enrollment status may be measured at multiple points to determine dropout rates.) Or, longitudinal analysis may illuminate the manner in which conditions at an earlier time point are predictive of outcomes at a later time point. (For example, one might examine how eighth graders with various \"risk factors\"--such as coming from a low-income home, having parents who did not finish high school, having a poor attendance record in eighth grade, and so on--fared two years later--for example, what proportion had dropped out, repeated a grade, and so on.) A second level of analysis is cross-sectional, or focused on a single time point. The base year sample provided a representative national cross-section of 1988 eighth graders. Because the longitudinal sample has been \"freshened\" with 1990 sophomores who were not in eighth grade in the United States in the 1987-1988 school year, it is a representative sample of the nation's spring-term 1990 sophomores. Likewise, for the 1992 round, the NELS:88 sample was freshened to generate a representative sample of the nation's 1992 seniors. This descriptive summary--A Profile of the American High School Senior in 1992--illustrates the cross-sectional level of analysis, which, as it were, takes a snapshot at a single point in time. Earlier NCES reports profiled 1988 eighth graders' and 1990 sophomores.' Finally, by maintaining a degree of comparability in questionnaire and test measures employed, NELS:88 first follow-up results support comparisons with HS&B sophomores of 1980,5 and NELS:88 1992 senior results may be compared to findings on HS&B and NLS-72 seniors.6"}, {"section_title": "Focus of This Report", "text": "This report examines the nation's high school seniors in the spring term of the 1991-92 school year. The senior year of high school marks a critical point in the passage of adolescents to adulthood. High school graduation represents the completion of formal schooling and the point of entry into the work force for some individuals, and the point of transition to postsecondary schooling for others. For some, marriage and parenthood have already begun. High school seniors follow different paths: these transition events--completion of schooling, entry into the labor force, and family formation--take place in afferent sequences and at different times for different individuals. But all seniors find themselves at a crossroad. The decisions they make at this point in their lives will have a lasting impact not only for them, but for society as well. Earlier in the century, most high school seniors were at the point of transition into the work force, having completed the course of their formal education. Today, about 75 percent plan to continue their education immediately after high school, and nearly 90 percent expect eventually to obtain at least some college training. Whether their plans include further education or the beginning of a career, data gathered at the completion of high school provides a unique vantage point for evaluating the experiences of the past and assessing the promise of the future. This report examines the background of 1992 high school seniors, the school environments that shaped their educational experiences, the curriculum in which they were enrolled, their academic achievement, their plans and expectations for the future, and their non-academic experiences during this important period of development. Chapter 1 of this report provides a demographic profile of high school seniors. Chapter 2 depicts their school and peer environment by recording seniors' perceptions of school and school safety, as well as the values of their peers. Chapter 3 describes their course and program enrollments. Chapter 4 examines the tested achievement of 1992 seniors. Chapter 5 describes their shortterm plans--their postsecondary plans, steps they have taken to gain entrance to college, and factors they considered in choosing a postsecondary institution. Chapter 6 reports on seniors' plans and expectations for the future. Finally, Chapter 7 describes the senior cohort's experiences outside of school--use of illicit drugs and alcohol, television viewing, jobs, participation in school government, and community volunteer work. Taken together, these seven chapters provide a statistical profile of the American high school senior in 1992. Clearly, with a data set of this size, it would be impractical to analyze all of the possible pairwise subgroups comparisons in a single report. We have attempted to provide an overview of the 1992 Senior Cohort and hope this sampling of results will prompt interested readers to conduct further research on additional questions. 6 See, for example, Green, P.J., (1993), High School Seniors Look to the Future, 1972 and 1992, (NCES 93-473); and Green et al., Trends Among High School Seniors, 1972 x xi A Profile of the American High School Senior in .1992 In order to streamline the analysis of data and provide a consistent, workable set of comparisons throughout, we have adopted the following procedures, recognizing that this is certainly not the only meaningful way to look at the data. Unless specifically prompted by previous woik reported in the text, generally comparisons on variables reported in quartiles or as subgroups based on cutpoints are conducted only as a contrast of the upper and lower quartiles (e.g., socioeconomic status, class rank, test quartiles), or as a contrast of extreme groups (e.g., percent of students receiving free or subsidized lunch). For non-quantitative variables, a single comparison group was used for all contrasts. For example, comparisons on type of school compare public to all other types; comparisons on race/ethnicity compare all groups to white. Once again, this is in no way meant to imply that these are the only meaningful comparisons, and the tables in the text and appendices provide meaas and standard errors that will allow the interested reader to conduct further analysis using the approach described in Appendix C. No data or comparisons are represented for American Indians because of the small sample size.

Many of these background characteristics have a lasting impact on students' perfonnance in high school and on their pursuit of further education.' Social class, parents' education, and race have all been demonstrated to have direct effects on achievement and expectations. For nearly 30 years, following the publication of Equality of Educational Opportunity by James Coleman and his colleagues,5 controversy has raged over mechanisms that might be used to diminish the gap between students from advantaged backgrounds and those from disadvantaged backgrounds, majority and minority students. Rather than enter this debate, this chapter will use NELS:88 data to outline social and economic differences that exist between subgroups of high school seniors. This will be followed by an examination of the types of schools these various social and economic groups attend. Parental educational attainment. There is strong evidence that the educational attainment of parents strongly influences their children's educational choices.' It is typical for children to meet or exceed the educational attainment of their parents. Figure 1.1 presents information on the highest level of schooling completed by seniors' parents. Approximately six out of ten seniors (62 percent) have a parent who continued his or her education beyond high school; almost four out of ten seniors (38 percent) come from families with parents who have a high school diploma or less.1\u00b07 For a description, based on NELS:88 data, of background characteristics that put students \"at-risk\" of school failure, see Kaufinan "}, {"section_title": "Some Trade or College 24.7%", "text": "Racial and ethnic background. During the past several decades, there has been substantial growth in the number of minority students enrolled in the nations' schools. For example, by some estimates, in Califorina, the most populus state in the nation, \"minority\" students will comprise the majority of entering students by the year 2010.11 The distribution of high school seniors for NELS:88 by race or ethnic group is presented in Figure 1.2. Over a quarter of all 1992 seniors (27 percent) are from racial and ethnic minority groups. Twelve percent are black, 10 percent are Hispanic, about 4 percent are of Asian descent12 and less than me percent are American Indian. Approximately 73 percent of seniors are white non-Hispanic students, a substantially smaller proportion than a decade earlier, in 1980, when 80 percent of seniors were white. '3 .. 2  Language minority status. Nine out of ten seniors speak English as their native language. English is the native language of nearly all white (98 percent) and black (96 percent) seniors. Approximately the same proportion of Asian (46 percent) and Hispanic (44 percent) seniors report English as their native language. A Profile of the American High School Senior in 1992 CY) CY) .cht Race and social class. Gaps in achievement and attainment between racial groups have been the subject of intense scrutiny over the years. Because race and class covary, it is important to consider race and class simultaneously. Figure 1.4 presents information on socioeconomic status (SES), a measure based on income, education, and occupation, by racial group (described in detail in Appendix B). From these data it is evident that race and class are related: Hispanics and blacks are more likely than whites to come from families in the lowest quartile of socioeconomic status. While fewer than 20 percent of white seniors come from the lowest SES quartile, one-half of Hispanics and 43 percent of blacks come from this group. Hispanics (10 percent) and blacks (10 percent) are far less likely than whites (29 percent) to come from high SES families. a.]  A Profile of the American High School Senior in 1992 Distribution of parental education by race. Data in Table 1.1 demonstrate that the level of parental education varies greatly across racial and ethnic groups. Students who are Hispanic are far more likely than white students to have parents who did not complete high school. And, compared with Asian and white seniors, a smaller percentage of black and Hispanic seniors have parents who graduated from college. Over one-quarter of Asian seniors (29 percent) come from families in which one or more parents completed graduate school. Approximately 20 percent of white seniors are from families in which one or more parents completed graduate school. Black and Hispanic seniors are far less likely than whites or Asians to have parents who completed graduate school: 10 percent of black and 10 percent of Hispanic seniors have parents who completed graduate school. Over 30 percent of Hispanic seniors have parents who did not graduate from high school, while 5 percent of white seniors have parents who did not complete high school. Distribution of racial and ethnic groups. Racial and ethnic groups are not distributed evenly throughout the United States. As Table 1.2 shows, nearly half of all Hispanic and Asian seniors live in the West, while black seniors disproportionately reside in the South. These figures are consistent with those reported by the U.S. Census Bureau for the same age group.'  A Profile of the American High School Senior in 1992"}, {"section_title": "Types of Schools Attended", "text": "Academic outcomes vary by the typss of schools students attend. Whether this results from selfselection, a superior environment for teaching and learning, or both, students who attend independent private schools with rigorous academic standards, or Catholic schools, demonstrate higher levels of achievement on standardized tests than students in public schools.\u00b0T ype of school. Differences in achievement between public and private school students are well docurented. There is widespread agreement that much of this gap is due to the cost of private education and the resulting selection bias of students into such schoolsaffluent families are more likely to send their children to private or parochial schools than less affluent parents. More controversial is the contention that, when background characteristics of students are held constant, students in private schools still appear to perfonn at a higher level than their public school peers. 16 Table 1.3 presents infonnation on the types of schools attended by race and social class. Nearly 20 percent of seniors in the highest quartile of socioeconomic status attend private or parochial schools, while 2.5 percent of seniors in the lowest quartile of socioeconomic status attend private or parochial schools. A larger percentage of black seniors (94 percent) than white seniors (90 percent) attend public schools. Black seniors (one-tenth of a percent) are somewhat less likely than white seniors (3 percent) to attend other private schools. In comparison to white seniors (1 percent), a smaller proportion of Hispanic seniors (twotenths of a percent) attend NAIS private schools. In addition to school control, several other characteristics of schools are associated with differential student outcomes: the location of the school in an urban, suburban, or rural environment; the socioeconomic status of the students attending school; and the racial and ethnic composition of the school. Table 1.3 also presents information on all these factors by race and social class. Location. Twenty-eight percent of seniors attend high schools located in urban areas. Approximately 42 percent of seniors attend suburban high schools and 31 percent go to high schools located in rural areas and small towns. Again, there are marked variations in this pattern by race. Whites are less likely than others to attend urban high schools. Twenty percent of white seniors attend urban high schools compared to between 46 and 49 percent of all other groups. Black seniors aro under-represented in suburban schools; 29 percent of black seniors attend suburban high schools compared to 45 percent of whites and 43 percent of Asians. Over one-third (35 percent) of white seniors attend schools in rural areas. In contrast, 11 percent of Asians, 20 percent of Hispanics and 22 percent of blacks =end rural schools. Forty-nine percent of seniors from high SES families attend suburban schools compared to 31 percent from low SES families. By contrast, 41 percent of low SES seniors attend rural schools, compared to 21 percent of high SES seniors. All social class groups are equally represented in urban schools. However, seniors from high socioeconomic status families disproportionately attend suburban schools and those from the lowest socioeconomic groups are disproportionately found in rural schools. "}, {"section_title": "44", "text": "Socioeconomic composition of school. As a result of residential housing patterns, schools vary enormously in the proportion of their students who are poor or rich. Previous research suggests that the wealth or poverty of neighborhoods has a direct impact on children's achievement.'7 In addition, the social class composition of schools has often been correlated with student success although the causal relationship has been debated. Arguments have been offered that the association between social class composition and student achievement results from the economic resources of the school, the influence of peer groups, or the instructional process. 18 The one thing that is not debated is that school composition .is related to measures of school achievement. An indicator of the number of economically disadvantaged students within a school is the proportion of students who are receiving free or reduced-price lunches. Overall, 44 percent of seniors attend schools where fewer than 10 percent of students receive reduced-price lunches and another 45 percent attend schools in which between 10 percent and 49 percent receive reduced-price lunches. Just 11 percent of seniors attend schools in which 50 percent or more of the students receive free or reducedprice lunches. Again, there are substantial differences between racial and ethnic groups. Five percent of white seniors attend schools in which the majority of students receive free or reduced-price lunches. In contrast to whites, a far greater percentage of Hispanic and black seniors attend schools that have high concentrations of students receiving free or reduced-price lunches. One-third of Hispanic seniors and 23 percent of black seniors attend schools in which the majority of students receive reduced-price lunches. It should be noted that, even amorv low SES seniors, the majority (7 8 percent) attend schools in which less than half of all students receive subsidized lunches. Twenty-two percent of low socioeconomic status seniors attend schools in which more than 50 percent of students receive subsidized lunches. Minority enrollment. School desegregation was a major policy goal in the late 1960s and 1970s. A variety of means (for example, busing and magnet schools) have been used to accomplish this end. However, housing patterns and residential segregation persist to the present, influencing the distribution of students within schools. Table 1.3 presents infonnation about the proportion of seniors attending schools in which over half of all students are members of racial or ethnic minority groups. About 8 percent of white seniors attend schools in which over half of the students are from racial or ethnic minority groups. Over one-third of Asian seniors (35 percent) attend schools which have high concentrations of minority students. Over half of black seniors (59 percent) attend schools in which minority students are the majority. Over two-thirds of Hispanic seniors (68 percent) go to schools that are primarily composed of minority students. Thirty-five percent of seniors in the lowest socioeconomic status group attend schools in which 50 percent or more of the students come from minority groups; 13 percent of those in the highest socioeconomic status group attend such schools.

Within that structure lies another infonnal organizationschools provide a social forum for adolescents and an organizing basis for forming friendships. These friendships are important because peer influence is perhaps more pronounced during this stage of life than during any other stage, and friends' attitudes toward school, grades, studying, and social life often set boundaries for a student's own views. Together these two forces, the school and peers, shape the context for learning. This chapter explores seniors' perceptions of the school climate, the prevalence of fear and crime within schools, and friends' value systems."}, {"section_title": "Seniors' Perception of School", "text": "Perceptions of teaching. As Table 2.1 demonstrates, over three-quarters of all seniois report that the quality of teaching in their schools is good, that teachers are interested in students, and that grading is fair. There is little variation in these perceptions by gender or region. However, differences between other subgroups do exist. Hispanics are somewhat more likely than whites to report that teaching at their school is good (88 percent compared to 85 percent, and blacks are somewhat less likely than whites to believe that students are graded fairly (72 percent compared to 80 percent). The largest differences observed occur between students in public and private schools. Five out of six public school seniors, 85 percent, agree with the statement \"the teaching is good.\" But a greater percentage of seniors at NAIS private schools, 99 percent, and Catholic schools, 90 percent, believe the teaching at their school is good. Ninety-one percent of seniors enrolled in Catholic schools, 98 percent in NAIS private schools, and 94 percent in other private schools report that teachers are interested in students, compared to 80 percent of seniors in public schools. Similarly, 84 percent of seniors at Catholic schools, 95 percent at NAIS private schools, and 90 percent at other private schools indicated that students are graded fairly, compared to 77 percent of the seniors at public schools. A Profile of the American High School Senior in 1992 A Profile of the American High School Senior in 1992 This variable represents respondents' self-report of the type of high school program in which they participated. A Profile of the American High School Senior in 1992 Perceptions of school are also tied to seniors' perfomiance in school, as measured by their class rank reported on their transcript, tested proficiency assessed by a standardized achievement test, and selfreported enrollment in a college preparatory program. Seniors who rank in the top quarter of their class are more likely than those in the lowest quarter to believe that teaching is good (89 percent compared to 79 percent), that teachers are interested in students (88 percent compared to 75 percent), and that students are graded fairly (85 percent compared to 69 percent). Seniors who demonstrate basic proficiency in reading, math, and science are more likely than those who failed to demonstrate basic proficiency in one or more of those areas to agree that teaching is good, that teachers are interested in students, and that grading is fair. Those enrolled in a college preparatory program are more likely than those in general education or vocational programs to report that teaching is good, teachers are interested in students, and that grading is fair.'9 Seniors at urban high schools are more likely than seniors at suburban high schools to believe teachers are interested in students (83 percent compared to 80 percent). Those attending schools with more than 50 percent of students receiving free or reduced-price lunches are less likely to report that teaching is good than those in schools where fewer than 10 percent of the students receive a free or subsidized lunch (84 percent compared to 89 percent). Parents' education and socioeconomic status influence seniors' perceptions of teacher interest in students. Eighty-six percent of seniors whose parents have graduate degrees perceive that their teachers are interested in the students, compared to 80 percent of seniors whose parents are only high school graduates. These two groups also differed in their perception of the fairness of grading: 82 percent of those whose parents have graduate degrees believe grading is fair compared to 76 percent of seniors with parents who completed only high school. Similarly, a significantly greater percentage of seniors from high socioeconomic status families (85 percent) than low SES families (80 percent) report that teachers are interested in students. And 83 percent of high SES seniors report that the grading is fair compared to 75 percent of low SES seniors. A Profile of the American High School Senior in 1992"}, {"section_title": "Perceived Safety at School", "text": "One of the national educational goals, instituted in 1989, is that \"every school in America will be free of drugs and violence and offer a disciplined environment conducive to learning\" by the year 2000. Obviously, the ability of schools to keep children safe is as important as the ability of schools to promote student learning. The climate for learning is also affected by student perceptions of their own safety. Feeling unsafe at school. The majority of seniors perceive schools to be safe placeS; approximately 90 percent of seniors report they feel safe at school. However, the crime and violence that occurs on our nation's streets has also spilled over to threaten some students' feelings of safety at school. From Table 2.2, it can be observed that one-in-ten seniors report that they do not feel safe in school. Minorities are more likely than whites to feel unsafe in school. Sixteen percent of black and Asian seniors, and 15 percent of Hispanic seniors, report feeling unsafe in school compare d to less than 9 percent of white seniors. Seven percent of seniors from families in the highest SES quartile, compared to 13 percent of seniors from the lowest SES quartile, feel that their schools are unsafe. Similarly, 7 percent of seniors whose parents have graduate degrees feel unsafe at school, compared to 11 percent of seniors whose parents did not continue their education beyond high school. Feeling unsafe is more prevalent at public schools than at any other type of school.\" And, in keeping with the fact that crime rates are highest in urban areas, seniors in urban schools are more likely to feel unsafe than their peers in suburban or rural schools. Eleven percent of seniors at public schools say they do not feel safe at school compared to 5 percent of seniors at Catholic schools, 4 percent of seniors at other private schools, and 2 percent of seniors at NAIS private schools. Fourteen percent of seniors in urban schools report they do not feel safe in school compared to 10 percent in suburban schools and 8 percent of seniors in rural schools. Fights between racial and ethnic groups. Seniors were also asked about fights between different racial and ethnic groups at school. Approximately 23 percent of seniors report that such fights occur often. Seniors whose parents have only a high school diploma are more likely to report interracial fighting occurring often than seniors whose parents have graduate degrees (30 percent compared to 19 percent). However, this percentage fluctuates widely among demographic subgroups. A Profile of the American High School Senior in 1992 Asian and Hispanic seniors are more likely to report that interracial fights often occur at their schools than white or black seniors. Nearly one-third of Asian and of Hispanic seniors report that fights often occur between different racial and ethnic groups at their schools. Twenty-one percent of white and 22 percent of black seniors report interracial fighting often occurring. Language minorities are more likely than native English-speaking seniors (30 percent compared to 22 percent) to report inter-group fighting often occurring. Seniors who rank in the bottom quarter of their class are more likely than those ranked in the top quarter to report that interracial fights occur often (28 percent compared to 20 percent). Twenty-eight percent of seniors from schools in a which a majority of students receive free or reduced-price lunches report that interracial fights occur often, compared to 18 percent of seniors attending schools in which 10 percent or less of the student body receive subsidized lunches. Interracial fights also vary by the type of school students attend. Racial and ethnic fights are more commonly reported by seniors in public schools (24 percent) than by seniors in Catholic (8 percent) or NAIS (2 percent) or other private schools (3 percent). In short, one-quarter of seniors at public schools, compared to 2 percent of seniors at NAIS private schools, say that fights often occur between different racial and ethnic groups. And finally, seniors attending urban and suburban high schools are more likely to report frequent interracial fights than are seniors attending rural schools (26 percent and 24 percent compared to 18 percent). Gangs in school. Sixteen percent of seniors, one out of every six, report that there are \"many gangs\" present in their schools. Large differences exist among demographic subgroups in reports of gang presence in schools. Hispanics are almost three times as likely as whites to report that there are many gangs in school. Thirty-six percent of Hispanic seniors report many gangs in schools compared to 12 percent of white seniot Asian seniors also report the presence of many gangs in approximately twice the proportion (27 percent) of white seniors. There is no significant difference between white and black seniors in the proportion reporting gang presence at school. Seniors from higher socioeconomic status families are less likely than seniors from lower socioeconomic backgrounds to report that there are many gangs in their schools (12 percent compared to 21 percent). The presence of many gangs is also reported approximately three times as often by seniors in schools in which more than half of all students receive free or reduced-price lunches than by seniors attending schools in which 10 percent or less of the student body receive free or reduced-price lunch (31 percent compared to 10 percent). A strong relationship exists between native language and reports of gangs in school. Fourteen percent of native English-speaking seniors report many gangs in their schools compared to 32 percent among non-native English speakers. A Profile of the American High School Senior in 1992 Seniors in public schools are more likely than seniors at other schools to report that gangs are present in school. Eighteen percent of public school seniors report there are many gangs in school. Less than 5 percent of Catholic school seniors and less than 2 percent of private school seniors report the presence of many gangs. As might be expected, the existence of gangs in schools varies by the location of the school. Gangs appear to be more prevalent in urban schools than in suburban or rural schools. And a higher percentage of seniors in Western states than other states report that many gangs exist in school. Over one-quarter of seniors in urban schools report that there are many gangs in school. Sixteen percent of suburban seniors and 8 percent of rural seniors report that there are many gangs in their schools. Gangs appear to be more prevalent in the West than in any other region, perhaps because of the previously mentioned difference in reports of gangs by Asian and Hispanic seniors. Thirty percent of seniors attending school in western states say that many gangs are present in school, more than twice the percentage of seniors from any other region (10 percent in the Northeast, 13 percent in the Midwest and 14 percent in the South).

Table 2.3 presents data on three experiences: having items stolen, being approached to buy drugs, and being threatened with physical harm Approximately 31 percent of all seniors state that they have had something stolen from them while at school. Physical violence and the threat of violence are less common--just 15 percent of seniors say someone has threatened to hurt them while at school. About this same proportion of seniors (16 percent), say that someone has offered to sell or give them drugs while in school. Exposure to the more serious of these offenses at school is more widespread among males than females. Young males are approximately twice as likely as young females to report that someone has offered them drugs (22 percent vs. 10 percent) or threatened to hurt them (20 percent compared to 11 pe rcent). Threats of physical violence are experienced by members of all racial and ethnic groups. However. Hispanic seniors are more likely than white seniors (21 percent compared to 17 percent) to report being offered drugs, while a significantly smaller proportion of blacks (9 percent) and of Asians (12 percent) report being offered drugs. This is congruent with the fact that drug use is more prevalent among white and Hispanic seniors than among other racial groups (see Chapter 7 of this report). There are no significant differences among racial/ethnic groups in the reported incidence of theft. The type and location of the school does affect the likelihood that a senior will report one of these three types of experience. Threats of physical violence are reported by a higher percentage of public school seniors (16 percent) than among Catholic school seniors (11 percent), and reports of offers of drugs are more prevalent in public (17 percent) than in \"other\" private schools (2 percent).

Table 2.4 presents these items for various subgroups. Among high school seniors, more women than men report their friends value regular class attendance, grades, and studying. Gender differences in the importance of studying are marked. While 43 percent of females say their friends think studying is very important, just 29 percent of males believe studying is very important to their close friends. Nearly 56 percent of females compared to 41 percent of males believe that their friends value getting good grades. Fifty-seven percent of females compared to 45 percent of males report that friends feel regular class attendance is very important. A number of differences by race and ethnicity are also apparent in Table 2.4. In particular: Forty-nine percent of Asians and 43 percent of blacks say that studying is very important, compared to 34 percent of whites who believe their friends feel studying is very important. (These is no significant difference between white and Hispanic seniors. Similarly, 59 percent of Asians and 56 percent of blacks feel their close friends think grades are very important compared to 46 percent of whites. Again, there is no significant difference between white and Hispanic seniors. The emphasis placed on academic activities varies with the location and type of school. Seniors at public schools, compared to those at Catholic schools, are less likely to report that studying is very important to their friends (35 percent vs. 43.7 percent), and are also less likely to think that attending class very important (50.3 percent vs. 59.4 percent). There is no significant difference between public and NAIS or other private schools. Suburban seniors feel less peer pressure than urban seniors with regard to attending class (47 percent compared to 55 percent), getting good grades (46 percent compared to 52 percent), and studying (33 percent compared to 41 percent). Not surprisingly, the proportion of seniors reporting that these activities are important to their close friends is significantly higher among those in the top quarter of their class as compared to those in the bottom quarter. For example, 57 percent of those in the top quarter of their class say that friends think it. is important to get good grades compared to 38 percent of those ranked in the bottom quarter of their high school class. A Profile of the American High School Senior in 1992 During the 10 years preceding the graduation of the high school class of 1992, a concerted effort was mounted to strengthen the curriculum taught in high schools. The call for a renewed emphasis on basic courses was outlined by the National Commission on Excellence in Education (NCEE) in 1983. This group recommended that every high school graduate complete four years of English, and three years of social studies, mathematics, and science, and its recommendation was echoed and amplified by others. In 1988, the Secretary of Education recommended to the President and the na+ion that graduation requirements be extended to include at least two years of a foreign language. In response to these suggestions, a campaign was mounted to modify the existing high school graduation requirements mandated by the 50 states and District of Columbia. The senior class of 1992 was enrolled in high school during the period following state implementation of more rigorous requirements for high school graduation. For example, by the fall of 1987, the year preceding 1992 seniors' entrance into high school, 88 percent of states had imposed graduation requirements in mathematics compared to only 76 percent of states in 1983.21 Additionally, many states with existing requirements had increased the number of mathematics courses required for graduation: 59 percent of states required two or more mathematics courses in 1983 compared to 85 percent of states in 1989. This chapter explores the extent to which this call for a strong national curriculum has been achieved and is reflected in the course-taking patterns of high school seniors. This chapter examines three indicators of curriculum: high school program, the combination of \"New Basics\" courses taken, and enrollments in specific courses. In addition, this chapter also considers the amount of time seniors spend studying outside of school."}, {"section_title": "High School Program", "text": "T pically, high school programs can be classified into one of three broad types: college preparatory programs, vocational programs, and general education programs. Students' academic experiences can vary considerably depending upon the program in which they are enrolled. In addition to differences in the sequence and content of courses, differences have been noted among programs in terms of teachers' experience, education, and expectations for student performance.22 Table 3.1 presents the distribution of seniors by program based on seniors' self-reports. 23 Nearly half of all seniors (48 percent) report they are in a college preparatory track. Most of the remaining seniors (40 percent) report they are in a general high school program. Twelve percent of seniors say they are enrolled in vocational or technical programs. Previous surveys in 1972 and 1980 indicated that females were less likely than males to be enrolled in a college preparatory program and more likely than males to be enrolled in a vocational high school program. From 1969-1980, a large percentage of women (between 55 and 68 percent) took consumer and/or home economics courses which were classified as vocational education. The gap noted by the earlier surveys has now disappeared,2A and today a considerably smaller proportion of women is enrolled in vocational education courses.25 Program placement26 is also strongly tied to gender and socioeconomic status. Males and females are enrolled in college preparatory (47 percent compared to 49 percent), general education (41 percent compared to 39 percent), and vocational programs (13 percent compared to 12 percent) at approximately the same rates. Sixty-five percent of seniors from the highest socioeconomic quartile report being in college preparatory programs while 28 percent of those from the lowest socioeconomic quartile report being in a college preparatory program. Seniors from the highest SES groups are also less likely than those from the lowest SES group to be enrolled in general education (32 percent compared to 49 percent) or vocational programs (3 percent compared to 23 percent). Differences between racial and ethnic groups are also pronounced. While about half of the white 12th graders are enrolled in a college preparatory pmgram, just 35 percent of Hispanic and 43 percent of black seniors are in that type of program. In contrast to white seniors, Hispanic seniors are more likely to be in a general education program (51 percent compared to 39 percent). And black seniors are more likely than white seniors to be enrolled in vocational education (17 percent compared to 11 percent). Almost half of all seniors (49 percent) whose native language is English are enrolled in college preparatory programs, compared to 43 percent of non-native English-speaking seniors. Green   It may be that student placement is constrained by the programs availabl lie at school. For example, many private high schools only offer a college preparatory curriculum. School-level curricular constraints are evident in the data presented in Table 3.1. Forty-five percent of seniors in public, 76 percent of seniors in Catholic, and 91 percent of seniors in NAIS private schools are enrolled in college preparatory programs. Seniors enrolled in Catholic and NAIS private schools are more likely than seniors in public schools to report being enrolled in a college preparatory program. Forty-two percent of public, 22 percent of Catholic, and 9 percent of NAIS private school seniors are enrolled in general education programs. Fourteen percent of seniors in public schools are in a vocational program; 2 percent or less of seniors in other schools are in vocational programs. Other school characteristics also appear to affect program placement.27 Seniors attending rural high schools ate more likely than those attending urban high schools to report enrollment in vocational (16 percent compared to 12 percent) or general education (42 percent compared to 36 percent) programs and are less likely to be in college preparatory programs (42 percent compared to 52 percent). Seniors in schools whem the majority of students receive free lunches are less likely to be enrolled in college preparatory programs than their counterparts in schools with 10 percent or less receiving a subsidized lunch, (39 percent compared to 55 percent) and they are more likely to be enrolled in vocational programs (16 percent compared to 8 percent). This variable represents respondents' self-report of the type of high school program in which they participated. A Profile of the American High School Senior in 1992"}, {"section_title": "Enrollment in New Basics Courses", "text": "Students enroll in courses for many different reasons: they are interested in the subject matter, the course is required for graduation, or they feel they need the course to prepare for future educational or career pursuits. Thus, students' course enrollment patterns can be indicative of many things: personal interests, program limitations or requirements, graduation requirements, postsecondary plans, and postsecondary opportunities. The \"New Basics\" curriculum first advocated in A Nation at Risk consists of a standard set of courses that students should be expected to take. The sequence of New Basics courses examined here reflects these National Commission on Excellence in Education (NCEE) guidelines: The \"minimum standard\" consists of 4 English, 3 social studies. 2 math, and 2 science yearlong courses. The NCEE recommended level includes the minimum standard plus 1 additional math and 1 additional science course. The highest level includes the minimum standard, plus 1 additional math and 1 additional science course, plus two courses in a foreign language, and a half-year course in computer science. As part of the 1992 round of NELS:88, high school transcripts were collected for a large subsample of NELS:88 seniors. Using these transcripts, it is possible to examine the pattern of courses typically completed by seniors and evaluate whether or not these seniors are meeting the recommended guidelines.28 From Table 3.2 it is evident that these standards are not yet universal. Over one-third of seniors have not taken the minimum sequence of courses recommended.29 And just 16 percent of all seniors have completed the advanced sequence recommended for college entrance which includes foreign languages and computer science. 18 The Tables and Analyses in this report which refer to New Basics Courses Taken are based on all seniors for whom 1992 transcripts were collected. For a complete description of the computation of this variable, see Appendix B. 2' Two of the reasons seniors failed to meet the New Basics minimum standard is that they either failed to take four English or three social studies courses.   Males are more likely than females to have taken less than the minimum standard combination of courses (40 percent compared to 35 percent). Parents' education and socioeconomic status are related to course-taking patterns. Seniors from low-SES families are more likely to take less than the minimum set of courses than those from high-SES families (48 percent compared to 27 percent). Similarly, seniors whose parents have less than a high school diploma (48 percent) or who have only a high school diploma (42 percent) are less likely to have completed the recommended basic sequence of courses than those who have completed college (32 percent) or received graduate degrees (26 percent). Racial differences are not sharp. Approximately the same proportion of white (36 percent) and Asian (33 percent) or black (40 percent) seniors fail to take the minimum recommended core courses. However, Hispanic seniors are more likely than white seniors to be below the recommended minimum for course-taking: nearly half (48 percent) of Hispanic seniors have not taken the minimum recommended core courses and only 12 percent have taken the most advanced combination. Some characteristics of the schools attended by 1992 seniors--the type of school, and the incomelevel of the student body--are also related to patterns of course work taken by seniors. Approximately the same percmtage of seniors at public (39 percent) and NAIS private (34 percent) schools fail to complete the minimum set of recommended coursee; fewer Catholic school seniors (21 percent) complete less than the recommended minimum set of courses. Seniors attending Catholic schools are more likely than seniors at public schools (33 percent compared to 15 percent) to have completed the courses in foreign languages and computer science as well as three courses in math and science. No differences exist among seniors in urban, suburban, and rural schools in the pattern of New Basics courses taken. Seniors from schools in which over half of all students receive free or reduced-price lunches are less likely to take the most rigorous sequence of recommended courses than those attending schools with fewer than 10 percent of students receiving subsidized lunches (11 percent compared to 18 percent). O Over ninety percent of NAIS private school seniors complete two math and two science course. However, some do not have four years of English or 3 years of social studies recorded on their transcripts. A Profile of the American High School Senior in 1992"}, {"section_title": "Courses Taken", "text": "Student course work and achievement in mathematics and science has caused some concern in recent years. Studies of international achievement in mathematics and science have found that American students' knowledge of science and mathematics lags considerably behind their counterparts in other industrialized countries.31 One of the determinants of tested achievement is the level of course work taken. Historically, student participation in advanced science and math courses has been low. A majority of high school seniors enroll in algebra and biology during the early years of high school, but fewer go on to enroll in geometry and advanced algebra or chemistry and physics. In 1982, the following patterns of course-taking were evident:3' In mathematics, 65 percent of 1982 graduates had taken Algebra I, 46 percent had taken geometry, and 35 percent had taken Algebra H. In science, three-quarters of 1982 graduates took biology, 31 percent took chemistry, and 14 percent took physics.      The figures cited here reflect the progress that has been made in curricular reform. To estimate the magnitude of this change more precisely, it is necessary to redefme the sample somewhat and compare high school graduates in 1992 with high school graduates in 1982. As reported in the Condition of Education, 1994, members of the Class of 1992 took far more advanced course work in mathematics and science than their 1982 counterparts.33 The percentage of graduates who completed four units of English and three units each of social studies, mathematics, and science increased significantly over the decade, from 13 to 47 percent. An increase was also observed for both sexes and all racial and ethnic groups. In addition, the proportion of graduates who complete both algebra II and geometry increased from 29 percent in 1982 to 50 percent in 1992. A similar increase in science is evident; 29 percent completed biology and chemistry in 1982 compared to 54 percent in 1992.34"}, {"section_title": "Student Engagement", "text": "Learning requires the active participation of the learner, which in turn requires both psychological investment in learning and effort directed toward learning.35 This student engagement can be gauged in a number of ways including measuring the amount of time spent in doing homework. Hours spent in completing homework outside of school is a clear example of an activity that is directed toward learning and requires active involvement on the part of the learner. While time spent doing homework in school is also important, time spent studying in school is often dictated by the school rather than by the student's own motivation to learn. Cross-national studies suggest that American I3-year old students spend less time engaged in homework than students in other countries. Students in Korea, Taiwan, Hungary, the Soviet Union, Italy (Emilia-Romagna), Israel, France, Spain, Ireland, and Jordan report spending more time on homework than students in the U.S. Although the link between hours spent doing homework and tested achievement is tenuous, the disparity has focussed attention on the amount of time U.S. students spend doing school work.\" Table 3 Perhaps most striking is the relationship between type of school attended and the amount of time spent on homework. Twice the proportion of seniors at NAIS schools, compared to public schools (80 percent compared to 38 percent), report spending an hour a day or more on homework. Part of this may be due to the fact that amount of time spent on homework varies with the type of high school program. One-quarter of seniors in vocational programs and one-third of seniors in general education programs spend at least an hour a day doing homework outside of school, compared to half of all students in college preparatory programs. Even though seniors in college preparatory programs spend more time engaged in homework than other seniors, the fact remains that only half spend at least an hour each day doing homework outside of school. Similarly, just half of students who plan to attend four-year colleges spend an hour a day on homework outside of school. Chapter 4 explores the impact of student effort on tested achievement.  The President and the National Governors Association have established national goals for student achievement. One of these goals states that \"American students will leave grades 4, 8, and 12 having demonstrated competency in challenging subject matter including English, mathematics, science, history and geography\"; another states that \"U.S. students will be first in the world in science and mathematics achievement\" by the year 2000. These are ambitious goals. hi 1990-1991, U.S. 13 year-olds ranked 13th out of 15 countries in which students were tested. In mathematics, U.S. students ranked next to last, 14th out of the 15 countries participating.37 Clearly, a substantial effort will be needed to meet the national goal."}, {"section_title": "An Overview of Proficiency Levels", "text": "As part of the NELS:88 Second Follow-Up, seniors were askeo to take a series of exams to test their achievement in reading, math, science, and social studies. For each of the first three subjects, proficiency levels are defined. While scores can also be calculated to indicate relative achievement level and gains since last tested, the scores indicating proficiency levels will serve as the focus for this chapter.' The primary advantage of examining scores based on proficiency levels is that the skills and content knowledge necessary to meet each proficiency level are clearly defmed. (see page 136ff). Reading. Figure 4.1 presents information on the seniors' proficiency in reading. Proficiency in reading is measured at three levels: Below Basic: Cannot comprehend author's main thought."}, {"section_title": "Basic:", "text": "Simple reading comprehension including reproduction of detail and/or the author's main thought. Intermediate: Ability to make relatively simple inferences beyond the author's main thought and/or to understand and evaluate relatively abstract concepts. Advanced: Ability to make complex inferences or valuative judgments that require piecing together multiple sources of information from the passage. As Figure 4.1 demonstrates, approximately one in twelve seniors (8 percent) cannot comprehend basic written information, and another 31 percent of seniors can grasp the main point of a paragraph but cannot go beyond this simple task. In other words, nearly four out of ten seniors (39 percent) have only basic, or less than basic, reading skills. Less than one-quarter of all seniors (23 percent) can understand and evaluate written arguments and make complex inferences based on the information presented. Mathematics. Seniors' exposure to mathematics varies quite dramatically depending on the academic track in which they are enrolled. It is common for seniors pursuing a rigorous college preparatory track to have completed courses in algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and advanced algebra by the time of graduation. In contrast, seniors in general or vocational tracks may take only business or general mathematics. Thus, mathematics proficiency is measured at five levels to capture the wide range of concepts covered in the multitude of different high school mathematics courses: Below level 1: Unable to perform simple arithmetic operations. Level 1 (low): Simple arithmetical operations on whole numbers: essentially single step operations which rely on rote memory."}, {"section_title": "Level 2:", "text": "Simple operations with decimals, fractions, powers, and roots. As the data in    Science. During the past 10 years, concern about student proficiency in science has escalated. The nation's ability to compete effectively in world markets depends in part on the scientific and technological skills of its labor force. Thus, schools have been called upon to renew their emphasis on science. High school science is taught at a wide range of levels, from general science to advanced placement physics. The test used in this study distinguishes scientific knowledge at three levels: Below Basic: Intermediate: Advanced: Does not demonstrate understanding of every day science concepts. Understanding of everyday science concepts; \"common knowledge\" that can be acquired in everyday life. Understanding of fundamental science concepts upon which more complex science knowledge can be built. Understanding of relatively complex scientific concepts; typically requiring an a iditional problem solving step. Sixteen percent of seniors fail to attain the most basic level of science proficiency. If that number is combined with the 30 percent of seniors who possess only \"common knowledge\" of science, it is apparent that nearly half (47 percent) of all seniors do not understand the fundamental principles of  Parents' education is strongly associated with proficiency in all three subjects. For example, seniors from families in which a parent attended graduate school are four times more likely to score at the advanced level of reading than seniors from families in which neither parent completed high school (39 percent compared to 10 percent). In mathematics, the difference between the two groups is staggering: 59 percent of seniors whose parents attended graduate school are classified in the top two levels of mathematics achievement. Only 11 percent of seniors whose parents failed to complete high school demonstrate this level of proficiency. Clearly, the level of parental education is strongly related to student achievement. School characteristics. Seniors who attend Catholic or NAIS private schools are more likely than those who attend public school to demonstrate advanced proficiency in reading, math, and science. Seniors attending NAIS private schools perform especially well on these tests. Again, the results in mathematics are striking: 81 percent of seniors in NAIS private schools tested at the highest level of proficiency in math. Only 32 percent of public school seniors, 47 percent of Catholic school seniors, and 42 percent of seniors attending non-NAIS private schools scored at this level. A Profile of the American High School Senior in 1992   School composition is correlated with student performance on these examinations. Seniors attending schools in which more than half of the student body qualifies for reducedprice lunches are more likely than those attending schools in which few students receive subsidized lunches to fail to meet minimum levels of proficiency in math (10 percent compared to 4 percent), and science (28 percent compared to 13 percent). Achievement of advanced proficiency in subject areas also appears to be less common among seniors attending schools with large proportions of students receiving free or subsidized lunch. Half as many seniors in schools with a majority of students receiving subsidized lunch, compared to seniors in schools with 10 percent or fewer students receiving subsidized lunch, demonstrate advanced proficiency. This is true across all three subject areas (in reading, 14 percent compared to 28 percent.; in math, 19 percent compared to 42 percent; in science, 9 percent compared to 26 percent). These findings should be interpreted cautiously. Because of their complexity, it is important to re-examine some of these relationships controlling for social class. In the next section, the relationship between race and achievement will be re-examined controlling for socioeconomic status, along with the relationship between school social class composition and achievement."}, {"section_title": "Race, Social Class, and Achievement", "text": "Many of the disparities in achievement between racial and ethnic groups result from economic and social inequities that are a reality in U.S. society. To make meaningful comparisons of achievement across racial and ethnic groups, it is important to hold social class constant. Tables 4.2a-c present data on the tested achievement of Asians, Hispanics, blacks, and whites controlling for socioeconomic status. From these data, it is apparent that some differences persist even when the effects of social class are held constant. Within each socioeconomic group, disparities between blacks' and whites' test performance can be observed. These differences are significant and exist in reading, mathematics, and science. Blacks are less likely than whites to demonstrate advanced proficiency in science; this is true in the low (2 percent compared to 11 percent), middle (6 percent compared to 24 percent), and high socioeconomic groups (18 percent compared to 40 percent). A significant difference in reading proficiency is also evident, but only for blacks and whites in the middle SES group: 9 percent of blacks compared to 24 percent of whites in this group demonstrate advanced proficiency in reading. Significant differences exist between Hispanic and white seniors, but only in the high SES    The relationship between the percentage of children receiving reduced-price lunches and achievement is strong because social class and achievement are closely associated. As shown in Table  4.3, if the relationship between achievement and the proportion of the student body receiving free lunches is examined separately for socioeconomic subgroups, it is apparent that the relationship is considerably weakened, but still significant. The socioeconomic composition of the school does affect middle-class seniors. In reading, at schools where at least half of all students receive subsidized lunches, 16 percent of seniors demonstrate advanced proficiency, compared to 25 percent of their peers in schools in which 10 percent or less of the student body receive subsidized lunches. In mathematics, at schools where at least half of all students are low-income, 19 percent of seniors demonstrate advanced proficiency compared to 35 percent of the seniors at schools in which 10 percent or less of the student body receives subsidized lunches. In science, at schools where at least half of all students receive subsidized lunches, 10 percent of seniors demonstrzte advanced proficiency, compared to 22 percent of their peers in schools in which 10 percent or less of the student body receive subsidized lunches. Seniors from the middle socioeconomic quartiles are more likely to demonstrate advanced proficiency if they attend a school in which relatively few students receive free or reduced-price lunches than if they attend a school with a majority of such students.  Student achievement is not a direct consequence of social background or school attendance. Rather, student effort is a major determinant of student achievement. One indicator of student effort is the amount of time spent doing homework outside of school. Also, student achievement in school, as measured by class rank, might be expected to .; associated with tested achievement. Additionally, the pattern of courses taken by a student is also known to impact student achievement. This section examines two measures of course-taking: the type of high school program in which the student is enrolled and whether the student completed a New Basics sequence of courses. Tables 4.4a-c presents information on proficiency in reading, math, and science by enrollment and effort. Class rank and proficiency. Not surprisingly, seniors who rank at the top of their class also demonstrate high levels of proficiency in reading, math, and science. However, it is also notable 'hat graduating in the top quarter is not synonymous with proficiency. Sixteen percent of those ranking in the top quarter of their class cannot read above the basic level. In math, 12 percent of those in the top quarter are unable to go beyond simple, single-step problems. In science, the results indicate that 23 percent of those in the top quarter demonstrate only basic proficiency, or less, in science. Among those in the top half, but not top quarter, of their class, 44 percent demonstrate basic or less than basic proficiency in science. Thus, even among the \"best\" seniors, there are some who possess only common-sense knowledge of science. Homework and proficiency. Seniors who spend more than one hour a day completing homework are more likely than their peers who spend only an hour a week to demonstrate advanced proficiency in reading, mathematics, and science. For example, 46 percent of those who spend at least 7 hours a week doing homework perform at the highest level of mathematics proficiency, while 20 percent of thosc who spend less than one hour per week perform at that level.   For most, the end of high school marks the beginning of a transition either to college or to the world of woik. The choices young people make during this rransition period can profoundly affect their future. This chapter explores how seniors negotiate the transition from high school to work or college by first examining their plans for after high school and then by looking at how they intend to carry out those plans."}, {"section_title": "Twelfth Graders' Postsecondary Plans", "text": "Having a college education has become increasingly important for employment and income.40 It is not surprising then that roughly three-quarters of all 12th graders plan to continue their education after high school. Table 5.1 presents data on postsecondary plans of high school seniors. Females are more likely than males to intend to continue on to college or trade school immediately after graduation--78 percent of women compared to 69 percent of men plan to go to a postsecondary institution right after high school graduation. There are no significant differences bl.,tween racial and ethnic groups in their plans to attend postsecondary schools immediately after high school graduation. Seniors' postsecondary plans appear to be linked to the educational background of their parents, type of high school they attend, and their performance in high school. There are noticeable differences between seniors with parents of differing levels of education. In fact, the percentage of seniors planning to go on to additional schooling climbs as parental education rises. While 64 percent of those whose parents did not go beyond high school say they will continue their education right away, 88 percent whose parents have graduate degrees say the same thing. Seniors' postsecondary plans differ depending on the type of high school they attend. Public school seniors are considerably less likely than seniors in NAIS private, other private schools, or Catholic schools to plan on continuing their education. Nearly all seniors (92 percent) who rank in the top quarter of their senior class plan to continue their education after high school. Fifty-seven percent of those in the bottom quarter of their senior classes have the same plans. Rural seniors are less likely to intend to continue their education after high school than urban seniors (67 percent compared to 77 percent). 40 For a discussion of the economic rate of return on the individual's investment in higher education, see Murphy, L., and F. A Profile of the American High School Senior in 1992 A significantly greater percentage of seniors in college preparatory programs (88 percent) intend to continue their education immediately after high school than seniors in general education (66 percent) or vocational education programs (50 percent). Ninety percent of the seniors who have taken 3 math and 3 science courses intend to continue their schooling, compared to 68 percent of those who completed 2 math and 2 science courses. A Profile of the American High School Senior in 1992 This variable represents respondents' self-report of the type of high school program in which they participated. A Profile of the American High School Senior in 1992 However, many seniors who appear to lack preparation for further schooling intend to continue their education. As just noted, over half of the seniors who rank in the bottom quarter of their high school classes plan to continue their education after high school. Other indicators of preparation also suggest that many seniors who plan to continue their schooling have limited preparation for doing so. Six out of ten seniors who fail to demonstrate basic proficiency in either reading, mathematics, or science intend to continue their education past high school. Two-thirds of seniors who have taken less than the minimum standard of New Basics courses anticipate pursuing further education. As will be seen in the next section, many of these seniors plan to confinue their education in four-year colleges and universities. A Profile of the American High School Senior in 1992"}, {"section_title": "Types of Postsecondary Schools Seniors are Most Likely to Attend", "text": "College enrollments have increased steadily throughout the last century. Just in the past 30 years, enrollments have increased from under five million in the early 1960s to over fourteen million in the early 1)90s. Much of this growth has occurred in the community college sector--two-year colleges now enroll over one-third of all college students. During this same period access to college has been broadened with increasing proportions of women and minorities attending college.4' Table 5.2 presents information on the types of postsecondary schools college-bound high school seniors plan to attend. Among seniors who plan to continue their education after high school, 62 percent plan to attend a four-year college, 18 percent plan to attend an academic program at a two-year college, 11 percent plan to enroll in a technical program at a two-year college, and 8 percent plan to go to a trade or vocational school. Women are somewhat more likely than men to report they will attend a two-year academic program (20 percent compared to 16 percent), and are somewhat less likely than men to plan to enroll in a trade school (7 percent compared to 10 percent). There are no differences between black and white seniors in their plans for postsecondary education. Approximately equal proportions of black and white seniors intend to continue their education at a four-year college. However, some ethnic differences are apparent in plans for postsecondary education. Nearly three-quarters (73 percent) of college-bound Asian seniors say they will attend a baccalaureate institution compared to 63 percent of white seniors. Ash'. wniors are also less likely than white seniors to plan to pursue a technical education at a community college (7 percent compared to 11 percent) or trade school (3 percent compared to 8 percent). About half (53 percent) of all Hispanic seniors plan to attend a four year college, a significantly lower percentage than white seniors (63 percent). However, a larger percentage of Hispanic than white seniors intend to condnue their educations at two-year colleges in academic programs (27 percent compared to 18 percent). Approximately equal percentages of Hispanic and white seniors intend to pursue some type of technical education. A Profile of the American High School Senior in 1992 As might be expected, parents' education has a strong influence on seniors' choices of postsecondary schools. Seniors whose parents hold college and graduate degrees are far more likely to plan on attending a four-year school than seniors whose parents have only high school diplomas (78 and 84 percent compared to 48 percent). They are also far less likely to plan on attending two-year program of any kind, or a trade school. The type of high school and high school program are also related to postsecondary plans. While 60 percent of college-bound seniors enrolled in public schools plan to go to a four-year college, 81 percent of those in Catholic schools and 95 percent of those in NAIS private plan to attend a four-year college. Over 80 percent of college-bound seniors in academic high school programs plan to go to a four-year college. In comparison with seniors in urban areas, a smaller percentage of seniors in rural and suburban school districts choose four-year colleges (68 percent compared to 61 percent and 57 percent). Rural seniors are also far more likely than urban seniors to plan to attend technical programs at two-year colleges (13 percent compared to 8 percent) or vocational schools (13 percent compared to 6 percent). Seniors attending schools in which the majority of students receive subsidized lunches are more likely than seniors in schools with few low-income students to plan to pursue technical programs in two year colleges (17 percent compared to 9 percent) or trade schools (13 percent compared to 5 percent). They are also less likely to plan to attend a four-year school (55 percent compared to 67 percent). College preparation and college choice are related. Clearly, seniors who have taken rigorous sequences of New Basics courses and those ranking in the top quarter of their high school class attend four-year colleges at a higher rate than other seniors. However, many of the seniors who plan to attend four-year colleges appear to have only limited preparation. Over 40 percent of the seniors who plan to continue their education and lack basic proficiency in one or more of the tested areas plan to go to a four-year college. One-third of seniors who rank in the bottom-quarter of their class and intend to continue their education plan on going to a four-year college. Almost half of the seniors who have failed to take the minimum sequence of New Basics courses and intend to continue their education plan to do so at a four-year college. A Profile of the American High School Senior in 1992 Steps Seniors Have Taken to Gain College Entrance Clearly, ambitious plans are of little value unless steps are taken to realize those plans. Realizing plans for postsecondary education involves completing a number of preliminary activities: entrance tests must be taken, colleges must be evaluated and chosen, and applications must be filed. This section examines two of the steps seniors take in order to realize their postsecondary goals: taking *college aptitude examinations and applying to colleges. Data are presented in Table 5.3 Six-out-of-ten seniors take at least one of the major entrance tests, usually the SAT or the ACT. Approximately the same number (63 percent) proceed to the next step and apply to a college. Striking differences in the social background of those who take entrance examinations and apply to colleges exist. In particular, the percentages of whites (64 percent) and Asians (72 percent) who take enft.ance tests are much larger than the percentages for Hispanic (44 percent) and black seniors (49 percent). Hispanics are also less likely to have applied to college than white seniors (51 percent compared to 65 percent). The education level of seniors' parents also appears to be strongly related both to taking college entrance exams and applying to one or more colleges. The general pattern observed is that seniors with more highly educated parents are more likely than others to take an entrance test or apply to college. For example, while three-quarters of seniors whose parents are college graduates report taking a college entrance examination and applying to a college, about half of those whose parents did not continue past high school report completing these steps. It is not surprising to find that seniors in college preparatory programs and those who attend private schools are much more likely to have taken concrete steps to get into college than public schoo1 seniors or those in general and vocational programs. For example, more than 80 percent of all seniors in Catholic schools, and 96 percent of those in NAIS private schools, applied to college, but fewer than 62 percent of all public school seniors applied. And while over 80 percent of seniors in college preparatory programs have taken entrance exams, less than half of seniors in other programs have done so. Finally, seniors planning on attending four-year colleges are far more likely than those planning to attend other types of schools to have taken formal steps to gain admittance to a postsecondary institution."}, {"section_title": "li7", "text": "A Profile of the American High School Senior in 1992  "}, {"section_title": "Choosing a College", "text": "What issues do seniors consider when deciding what college to attend? In choosing colleges, students' thinking is very much like that of a consumer.42 Like consumer goods, students evaluate colleges on the basis of their financial cost and on the basis of their perceived potential short and long term benefits. An example of the former would be a safe and friendly learning environment while an example of the latter would be facilitating career goals. In the Second Follow-Up questionnaire, seniors were asked the importance of 18 items in making their college selections. The items art listed in Figure 5.1 according to the number of seniors who ranked it as \"important\" or \"very important.\" While college is an enjoyable and satisfying experience in itself, it is also a \"stepping stone\" over which students pass before beginning a career. This fact appears to weigh heavily in seniors' thinking about the type of college they want to attend. Two of the three items considered important in choosing a college reflect the relationship between educational and career aspirations. The two items are the availability of degree programs that allow students to get jobs in their chosen fields (considered very important by 66 percent), and the college's record in placing graduates in jobs (cited as important by 53 percent of seniors). Two-thirds of all seniors report that the availability of degree programs that allow students to .get jobs in their chosen fields is very important. Over 60 percent cite the availability of specific courses or curriculum as an important factor in selecting a college. Over half of all seniors (53 percent) think that the college's record in job placement is important. Clearly, high school seniors are seeking college experiences that will help them realize their career goals. At the same time, seniors are also concerned about the academic quality of postsecondary schools. Half of all seniors think that the academic reputation of a college is important. Thirty-five percent of seniors report that the graduate school placement record is important.   "}, {"section_title": "70 80 122", "text": "Personal safety and financial matters are also factors that many high school seniors take into consideration when choosing colleges. Nearly half (45 percent) say that the availability of financial aid, such as school loans, scholarships, or grants make colleges much more attractive to them. Similarly, nearly one-third (31 percent) of seniors report that they seriously consider the cost of tuition, books, and housing. Roughly the same percentage of seniors say that location in a low-crime environment is an important feature of a school. A number of factors appear to play a significant role in the college decision-making process for a small minority of seniors. Fewer than 10 percent think that a college's ethnic composition, the availability of athletic programs, the existence of a religious environment, or attending the same school as their parents are important factors. A Profile of the American High School Senior in 1992 Chapter 6: Plans and Expectations for the Future This chapter examines seniors' educational and occupational plans and aspirations, and describes seniors' own expectations as well as their perceptions of parental expectations. Finally, the chapter explores how seniors view the connection between their education and their ability to achieve their occupational goals. Overall estimates and breakdowns by gender are discussed in the text of this report. Additional breakdowns by race/ethnicity and by socioeconomic status are presented in Appendix F (Percentages) and Appendix G (Standard Errors). They are not discussed here because the variables in this chapter have so many categories that these additional breakdowns result in rather small sample sizes; they should be used with caution."}, {"section_title": "Educational Expectations of Seniors and Their Parents", "text": "High school students' aspirations for higher education have increased significantly over the past decade, both in terms of expectations for completing a basic college program and for obtaining a graduate degree.43 Table 6.1 presents data on the level of education high school seniors expect to complete. Overall, approximately 66 percent of seniors expect to complete a college program; 34 percent expect to end their education with a baccalaureate degree and 32 percent expect to complete a graduate degree. Parental expectations and encouragement are key factors in children's successful achievement of academic goals.\" To assess the relationship between parental expectations and seniors' own expectations, seniors in this study were asked to identify the highest level of education their parents expect them to attain. A significantly higher percentage of seniors report that their parents expect them to finish a college program than report that they themselves expect to obtain a four or five year college degree. A significantly larger percentage of seniors think that their fathers, compared to their mothers, are uncertain about their academic future (9 percent compared to 7 percent). As can be seen in Figure 6.1, when educational expeqations are examined by gender, some important differences emerge. While approximately equal proportions of male and female seniors expect to end their education with a college degree, significantly more females expect to obtain a graduate degree. This is consistent with trends in females' educational ambitions observed since"}, {"section_title": "1972.45", "text": "Five percent of all seniors expect to go no further than high school, but the percentage is significantly lower for females (3.8 percent) than for males (6.3 percent).

By far the largest number of seniors choose business as their most likely field of study, approximately 14 percent of all seniors. Other fields of study selected by large numbers of seniors include \"pre-professional\" programs, health, engineering, and education. Each of these fields is mentioned by approximately 7 percent of seniors. Home economics, mathematics, foreign languages, philosophy, and ethnic studies are selected by less than 1 percent of seniors.

While some fields attract equal percentages of men and women, interesting differences emerge for other fields of study. Business remains the field chosen by the largest percentage of both males and females, and is chosen by them in approximately equal proportions (14 percent). Several fields are chosen by a greater proportion of females than males: Education (10 percent compared to 4 percent, health (11 percent compared to 3 percent), and psychology (6 percent compared to 2 percent). A significantly greater proportion of males than females think they will study engineering (12 percent compared to 2 percent). Seniors' choices for vocational training are presented in Table 6.3. No single field of vocational study attracts a large number of seniors, and preferences appear quite diffuse across the alternatives. Auto mechanics and health care are the most frequently chosen fields of vocational training; about 2 percent of seniors say they are likely to pursue training in those fields. Elect Tonics, cosmetology, secretarial training, business management, data processing, and computer programming are each selected by about 1 percent of seniors. A Profile of the American High School Senior in 1992 It is evident from the data presented in Figure 6.3 that a number of differences exist between senior men and women in the fields of non-academic training they are likely to pursue. Among occupations selected by at least 1 percent of the seniors, Gender differences can be observed in health care, cosmetology, secretarial, auto mechanics, and electronics. Males are more likely than females to intend to pursue training in auto mechanics and electronics; females are more likely than males to plan to pursue health care, cosmetology, and secretarial training. No significant differences were found in computer programming or business management.  Occupational Goals In this study, seniors were asked about the occupation they expected to have at age 30. The list of occupations presented to respondents included two categories of general professionals, as well as separate categories for teachers and managers. These data are presented in Table 6.4. Approximately 18 percent of all seniors expect they will have a professional occupation at age 30 that is generally regarded as requiring graduate education (such as being a minister, dentist, doctor, lawyer, scientist, or college teacher). Another 27 percent expect to hold some other type of professional job at age 30. An additional 11 percent think they will hold business management positions, either as a manager in an organization (5 percent) or as a small business owner (6 percent). Once again, gender differences in occupational preference are observable (see Figure 6.4). A larger percentage of females than males expect pmfessional occupations. Among seniors, males are more likely than females to see themselves as managers (6 percent compared to 5 percent) and small business owners (8 percent compared to 4 percent) at age 30. Males also show a greater preference than females for technical (  Education and Occupational Choice Students' perceptions about the level of education they will need to work in their chosen fields can be expected to influence their postsecondary plans. Because of this, seniors were asked to gauge the level of educadon they thought they would need for the occupation they expect to have at age 30 (see Table 6.5). Six percent believe that their high school diploma will be sufficient to attain their occupational goals at age 30. Another 25 percent think they will need to attend at least some college. Over two-thirds believe they will need to complete at least a college degree: 38 percent believe they will need to complete a baccalaureate degree, and 30 percent report they will need a graduate degree. Perceptions of educational requirements are seen differently by men and women, as illustrated in Figure 6.5. Approximately equal proportions of males (38 percent) and females (39 percent) expect that a college degree will be sufficient. A greater proportion of females than males believe that they will need a graduate degree (33 percent compared to 27 percent), while a higher percentage of males than females feel they can get by with a high school diploma or less. (8 percent compared to 4 percent).  Only part of a student's life is spent in school. What happens after school--at home, with friends, and at work--is equally important. Extracurricular activities, for example, can play an important role in students' growth and development. They can provide students with an opportunity to explore interests outside of the classroom, and can offer students a means for organized social interaction. There are other activities, however, in which many students engage that can be harmful to their growth and development; drug and alcohol use are among these. This chapter explores student life outside of school, presenting a snapshot of seniors' work, civic activities, use of illicit drugs and alcohol, and television viewing."}, {"section_title": "Work", "text": "The employment status of seniors is presented in Table 7.1. About half of all seniors work in addition to going to school. Two-thirds of working seniors are employed half-time or less and one-third work more than 20 hours per week. Fewer males than females are employed (48 percent compared to 52 percent), and a larger proportion of whites are employed than any other racial or ethnic group (54 percent compared to less than 42 percent). Perhaps the most interesting relationship reported in Table 7.1 is that between class rank and number of hours worked. Seniors ranking at the top of their class are as likely to be employed as lowestranking seniors. However, they are less likely than other seniors to be working more than half time: about one in every ten top-ranking seniors (11 percent) is employed more than 20 hours per week compared with one in every five seniors (21 percent) ranked in the bottom quarter of their class. The type of school and program attended are also related to the number of hours worked. As might be expected, seniors attending NAIS private schools are less likely to work after school than those attending public or Catholic schools. Seniors enrolled in vocational education programs are more likely than seniors in other high school programs to be working. And seniors in vocational programs work longer hours--over a quarter of these seniors work more than 20 hours each week. A Profile of the American High School Senior in 1992 "}, {"section_title": "School Government and Volunteer Work", "text": "The cultivation of citizenship has long been a major goal of American schools. The National Education Goals Panel has reiterated this goal, proposing that \"every school in American will ensure that all students learn to use their minds well, so they may be prepared for responsible citizenship, further learning, and productive employment in our modem economy.\" Students begin the process of learning to be good citizens by involvement in activities in school and in the wider community. Two such activities are explored here: high school seniors' participation in student government and community volunteer work. Data on participation is presented in Table 7.2. School government. School government is an activity that allows students to develop leadership skills. One-in-six seniors participates in school government and female seniors are more likely than males to participate (18 percent compared to 14 percent). There is a significant difference between seniors whose parents have a high school education or less and those whose parents have bachelor's degrees and graduate degrees. Seniors whose parents have advanced degrees participate in student government at approximately twice the rate of seniors whose parents did not finish high school. Eleven percent of seniors with parents who have less than a high school education participate in student government. Among seniors whose parents hold post-baccalaureate degrees, that number is doubled, 22 percent. Seniors who perform better academically are more likely than others to be involved in student government. A little over a quarter of seniors who rank in the top quarter of their class report having participated in student government whereas less than 10 percent of those who rank in the bottom quarter of their class are active in student government. Volunteer work. Volunteer work and community service help foster ties between students and their communities. Some schools require or strongly encourage student volunteer activities. By contributing to the communities in which they live, students can increase their sense of belonging in the community and establish a stake in their community's success. High school seniors are active in their communities. Forty-four percent of seniors report that they have performed some kind of volunteer work during the past two years. Volunteer work is more common among female than male seniors: half of these young women have engaged in volunteer work while 39 percent of the young men have done so. Conununity volunteer work appears to be related to parental education and the schools students attend. Seniors from homes in which parents are college-educated are more likely to be involved in these activities than seniors from less-educated families. For example, 60 percent of seniors whose parents have graduate degrees have done volunteer work compared to 31 percent of senkus whose parents did not finish high school. And the rate of involvement in volunteer work is higher among those in college preparatory tracks (56 percent) than among those enrolled in general (36 percent) or vocational education (30 percent) programs. Seniors attending NAIS private and Catholic schools are more typically engaged in volunteer work than seniors attending public schools (73 percent and 67 percent compared to 42 percent). Volunteer work is more prevalent among those ranked in the top quarter of their class than those in the bottom quarter (61 percent compared to 29 percent). The seniors in urban schools volunteer at a higher rate than their suburban or rural counterparts (49 percent compared to 44 percent and 40 percent). A greater proportion of white (46 percent) and Asian seniors (48 percent) volunteer than black (36 percent) or Hispanic seniors (39 percent).

Marijuana use has also declined substantially, so that today only a small percentage of high school seniors use marijuana or cocaine. Marijuana. Data presented in Table 7.3 indicate that approximately one-quarter of all high school seniors report having tried marijuana, down from a high of 60 percent in 1979.\" Marijuana use is most prevalent among white and Hispanic seniors. Ten percent of white seniors report using marijuana during the past month compared to 8 percent of Hispanic seniors, 4 percent of black seniors, and 4 percent of Asian seniors. This means that white seniors report using marijuana in the past 30 days at more than twice the rate of Asian and black seniors. Contrary to current media images of drug use, marijuana use is not a problem that is concentrated in urban areas or more prevalent among the less educated. Experimentation with marijuana at least once is as prevalent among seniors whose parents received a graduate degree as among those whose parents did not complete high school (27 percent). And marijuana use is more prevalent in the suburbs (29 percent) than in cities (25 percent). Marijuana use is also more prevalent at elite private high schools than in public schools. One-third of seniors at NAIS private high schools report using marijuana during the past year, while 16 percent of seniors at public schools report using marijuana in the same time period. Furthermore, seniors in schools with high concentrations of less advantaged students (those receiving free or reduced-price lunches) are no more likely to use marijuana than those in more affluent schools. As expected, seniors who perform well in school are less likely to use marijuana than those who are doing less well. Five percent of seniors in the top quarter of their classes used marijuana during the past month whereas 13 percent of seniors ranked in the bottom quarter of their senior class report using marijuana in the past 30 days. Seniors in college preparatory programs report significantly lower use of marijuana than their counterparts in other programs, in both lifetime use and use during the last 30 days. Cocaine. Patterns of cocaine use are somewhat different than patterns of marijuana use. Both white (4 percent) and Hispanic (7 percent) seniors are more likely to report that they have tried cocaine than black seniors (1.3 percent). The same pattern holds for more recent use: three-tenths of one percent of black seniors report having used cocaine during the past year, compared to 3 percent of Hispanic seniors and 2 percent of white seniors. No significant differences in cocaine use are observed based on the level of parents' education. Differences between urban and suburban schools and public and private schools are less pronounced for cocaine than marijuana. There is no significant difference between seniors at urban and suburban schools in the use of cocaine. There are also no significant differences among the different types of schools in the percentage of seniors who have tried cocaine, although seniors at Catholic schools are less likely to report cocaine use during the last month than seniors at public schools (.3 percent compared to .9 percent)."}, {"section_title": "A Profile of the American High School Senior in 1992", "text": "Cocaine use is linked with academic performance in school.

A majority of high school seniors, 88 percent, report having tried alcohol, and alcohol consumption occurs within almost every subgroup examined. Like drug use, recent alcohol use is more common among men (54 percent) than women (44 percent), although approximately equal proportions of males and females have tried it. In tenns of trying alcohol, 89 percent of Hispanics and 90 percent of whites; have tried alcohol compared to 80 percent of blacks and 78 percent of Asians. However, there appears to be little correlation between alcohol use and parents' education. Because alcohol consumption is so universal, it is informative to separate out those seniors who drink to intoxication. Here that is defined as any person having five or more drinks in a row during the past two weeks. Over one-quarter of all seniors report drinking five or more drinks in a row during the past two weeks. This type of heavy drinking is reported more frequently among males (35 percent) than females (20 percent). Thirty percent of white seniors and 27 percent of Hispanic seniors report drinking heavily in the past two weeks, compared to 13 percent of blacks and 17 percent of Asians. In fact, the proportion of white seniors reporting having five or more drinks in the past two weeks is more than twice that of black seniors. Heavy drinking is more prevalent among seniors at Catholic high schools than among seniors at public schools. Nearly 37 percent of seniors at Catholic schools report having five or more drinks in the past two weeks, compared to 27 percent of seniors at public schools. Seniors at non-NAIS private schools are less likely to drink heavily than seniors at public schools. Performance in school and drinking to intoxication are correlated. While 17 percent of seniors who rank in the top quarter of their graduating class report drinking heavily in the past two weeks, nearly 40 percent of those ranking in the bottom quarter of their class have had five or more drinks in the last two weeks. Clearly, alcohol use is a greater problem among high school seniors than either marijuana or cocaine. It is especially prevalent among white and Hispanic seniors, the two groups who are also more likely to use illicit drugs. Stereotypes of typical teenage alcohol users do not reflect reality. Alcohol use is more likely to occur among seniors in elite private schools and in schools in which fewer than 10 percent of all students receive free lunch than in public schools or schools in which at least half of all students receive subsidized lunch. A Profile of the American High School Senior in 1992  "}, {"section_title": "Television", "text": "Debates over the impact of television on children have continued for many years. There is concern about both the amount and type of programming children view. Detractors of television have argued that television viewing can result in increased aggressive behavior and decreased levels of physical activity, as well as displacement of study time, outside reading, and other activities. In this study, seniors were asked how many hours they viewed television on weekdays and weekends. By weighting the responses to the two questions, the total amount of time spent watching television can be estimated. By their own estimates, seniors watch a great deal of television. Forty percent report viewing television for more than 20 hours per week. Less than a quarter (24 percent) of all seniors watch 10 hours of television or less per week. The difference, as illustrated in Figure 7.1, between the television viewing habits of black seniors and seniors of other racial groups is striking. Sixty-two percent of black seniors report watching more than 20 hours of television each week. In contrast, 36 percent of white seniors watch television more than 20 hours each week. Television viewing is directly related to the level of schooling completed by parents. As parental education increases, the proportion of 12th graders watching television more than 20 hours per week decreases. Seniors whose parents did not complete high school are almost twice as likely to watch television more than 20 hours each week than seniors whose parents attended graduate school (53 percent compared to 27 percent). The type of school appears to be unrelated to the amount of time a student spends watching television. However, a significantly smaller percentage of seniors in college preparatory programs, than other high school programs, watch more than 20 hours of television per week (36 percent compared to 42 percent or more). Seniors who attend schools in which half of the students receive free or reducedprice lunches are more likely to be heavy television viewers than seniors attending schools with fewer than 10 percent of such students (50 percent compared to 37 percent). Finally, as illustrated in Figure 7.2, seniors ranked in the top quarter of their class are less likely than those ranked in the bottom quarterto watch more than 20 hours of television each week (32 percent compared to 42 percent)."}, {"section_title": "luU", "text": "A Profile of the American High Schooi Senior in 1992   The National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988: Overview NELS:88's major features include the planned integration of student, dropout, parent, teacher, and school studies; the initial concentration on a 1988 eighth grade student cohort to be followed over a period of ten years; the inclusion of supplementary components to support analyses of geographically or demographically distinct subgroups; and the design linkages to previous longitudinal studies and other current studies. The base year of the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88) represented the first stage of a major longitudinal effort designed to provide trend data about critical transitions experienced by students as they leave elementary school and progress throagh high school and into postsecondary institutions or the work force. This study of the 1988 eighth grade cohort collects data about educational processes and outcomes pertaining to student learning, predictors of dropping out, and school effects on students' access to programs and equal opportunity to learn. The first follow-up in 1990 provided the first opportunity for longitudinal measurement of the 1988 baseline sample. It also provided a comparison point to high school sophomores ten years before, as studied in HS&B. The study captured the population of early dropouts (those who leave school between the end of eighth grade and the end of tenth grade), while monitoring the transition of the student population into secondary schooling. The second follow-up took place in 1992, when most sample membcrs entered the second term of their senior year. The second follow-up provides a culminating measurement of learning in the course of secondary school, and also collects information that will facilitate investigation of the transition into the labor force and postsecondary education after high school. (Freshening\" the NELS:88 sample to represent the twelfth grade class of 1992 makes trend comparisons with the senior cohorts that were studied in NLS-72 and HS&B possible.) In addition to surveying the students who were in school during the first follow-up, the NELS:88 second follow-up resurveyed students who were identified as dropouts in 1990, and identified and surveyed those additional students who left school after the first follow-up. The third follow-up took place in the spring of 1994, when most sample members had been out of school for two years. The 1994 data collection was designed to meet four general requirements for information about American education. These can be characterized as looking backward within the cohort(s) to understand the impact of prior experiences on current circumstances, looking ahead to provide a basis for understanding cohort members' future experiences, looking within the cohort at a single point in time to compare the outcomes and experiences of different social groups, and looking across cohorts by comparing the experiences of the NELS:88 cohort(s) with comparable cohorts separated by one and two decades. Major content areas for the third follow-up questionnaire were: education histories; work experience histories; work related training; family formation; opinions and other experiences; occurrence or non-occurrence of significant life events; and income. The NELS:88 fourth follow-up is slated for 1998. 49 The process rt-ferred to here as \"freshening\" added students who were not in the base year sampling frame, either because they were not in the country or because they were not in eighth grade in the spring tcrm of 1988. The 1990 freshening process provided a representative sample of students enrolled in tenth grade in the spring of 1990. The 1992 freshening process provided a representative sample of students enrolled in twelfth grade in the spring of 1992. The base year study design comprised four components: surveys and tests of students, and surveys of parents, school administrators, and teachers. A student questionnaire gathered information about basic background variables and a range of other topics including school work, educational and occupational aspirations, and social relationships. Students also completed a series of curriculum-sensitive cognitive tests to measure educational achievement and cognitive growth between eighth and twelfth grades in four subject areasreading, mathematics, science, and social studies (history/geography/civics). One parent of each student was asked to respond to a parent survey intended to measure parental aspirations for children, family willingness to commit resources to children's education, the home educational support system, and other family characteristics relevant to achievement. Selected teachers (in two of the four subject areas) completed a teacher questionnaire designed to collect data about school and teacher characteristics, evaluations of the selected students, course content, and classroom teaching practices. Finally, a school administrator questionnaire was completed by school principals. It gathered descriptive information about the school's teaching staff, the school climate, characteristics of the student body, and school policies and offerings. In the NELS:88 base year, a two-stage stratified probability design was used to select a nationally representative sample of eighth grade schools and students. Schools constituted the primary sampling unit; the target sample size for schools was 1,032. A pool of 1,032 schools was selected through \u00a7tratifted sampling with probability of selection proportional to eighth grade size and with oversampling of private schools. A pool of 1,032 replacement schools was selected by the same method. Of the 1,032 initial selections, 30 proved to be ineligible. Of the 1,002 eligit c selections, 698 participated. An additional 359 schools (supplied by alternative selections available from the replacement pool) also participated, for a total school sample of 1,057 cooperating schools, of which 1,052 schOols (815 public schools and 237 private schools) contributed usable student data. For 1,035 of these 1,052 schools, both student and school administrator data were received. In the NELS:88 base year design, students were the secondary sampling The first follow-up of NELS:88 comprised the same components as the base year study, with the exception of the parent survey, which was not repeated in the 1990 round. In addition, three new componentsthe dropout study, base year ineligible study, and school effectiveness studywen initiated in the first follow-up, and a freshened sample was added to the student component. As in the base year, students were asked to complete a questionnaire and cognitive test. The cognitive test was designed to measure tenth grade achievement and cognitive growth between 1988 and 1990 in the subject areas of mathematics, science, reading, and social studies (history/geography/civics). The student questionnaire collected basic background information, and asked students about such topics as their school and home environments, participation in classes and extra-curricular activities, current jobs, their goals and aspirations, and opinions about themselves. Following the base year design, two teachers of each student were asked to complete a teacher questionnaire, and a school administrator questionnaire was completed by school principals. First-time participants in NELS:88 completed a new student supplement, conUining basic demographic items which were asked in the base year but not repeated in the first follow-up. The first follow-up also surveyed and tested youths who had dropped out of school at some point between the spring term of the 1987-88 school year and that of the 1989-90 school year. The dropout questionnaire collected information on a wide range of subjects, including reasons for leaving school, school experiences, absenteeism, family formation, plans for the future, employment, attitudes and self-concept, and home environment. The selection of students was implemented in two stages. The first stage of sampling involved the selection of 21,474 students who were in the eighth grade NELS:88 sample in 1988. The representative subsample of the eighth grade cohort was augmented through a process called \"freshening.\" The goal was to pmvide a representative sample of students enrolled in the tenth grade in the 1989-90 school year. Freshening added an additional 1,229 tenth graders (of whom 1,043 were found to be eligible and still retained after final subsampling) who were not contained in the base year sampling frame, either because they were not in the country, or were not in the eighth grade in the spring term of 1988. Several components were added to the first follow-up to increase its analytic power. One of these enhancements, the base year ineligible (BYI) study, was added to the first follow-up in order to ascertain the 1990 school enrollment status and the 1990 NELS:88 eligibility status of students who were excluded from the base year survey due to a language barrier or physical or mental disability which precluded them from completing a questionnaire and cognitive test. In addition to the BYI study, the school effectiveness study (SES), designed to sustain analyses of school effectiveness issues, was conducted in conjunction with the first follow-up. The within-school student sample of 248 participating first follow-up high schools in the thirty largest metropolitan statistical areas was augmented to produce a probability sample of both schools and students within the framework of the primary longitudinal study."}, {"section_title": "Second Follow-Up Core Study and Sample Design", "text": "The NELS:88 second follow-up repeats all components of the first follow-up study. In addition, the parent component is included once again in the second follow-up. Two new componentsthe transcript and course offerings and enrollment componentswere initiated in the second follow-up. The course offerings and enrollment component was implemented as a part of the school effectiveness study (SES). The transcript component was undertaken for sample members as described in section 1.3.5 below. Sample freshening was also implemented in the second follow-up to provide a representative sample of students enrolled in the twelfth grade during the spring term of the 1991-1992 school year. As in the previous waves, students were asked to complete a questionnaire and cognitive test. The cognitive test was designed to measure twelfth grade achievement and cognitive growth between 1988 and 1992 in the subject areas of mathematics, science, reading, and social studies (history/geography/civics). The student questionnaire asked students about such topics as academic achievement; student perceptions and feelings about their curriculum and school, family structure and environment; social relations; aspirations, attitudes, and values, especially as they relate to high school and occupational or postsecondary educational plans. The student questionnaire also gathered data about the family decision-making structure during the critical transition from secondary school to postsecondary education or the work environment. A Profile of the American High School Senior in 1992 The student questionnaire contained a supplement for early graduates, the intent of which was to document the reasons for and circumstances of early graduation. In a departure from the base year and first follow-up teacher survey designs only one teacher (either a mathematics or science teacher) of each student was asked to complete a teacher questionnaire.51 A school administrator questionnaire, as in the first follow-up, was completed by school principals. If a student was a first-time participant in NELS:88, he or she also completed a new student supplement, containing basic demographic items which were asked in the base year but not repeated in the second follow-up. The second follow-up, in addition to surveying students who were enrolled in school, surveyed and tested youths who had dropped out of school at some point between the spring term of the 1987-88 school year and the spring term of the 1991-92 school year. The dropout questionnaire collected information on a wide range of subjects, including reasons for leaving school, school experiences, absenteeism, plans for the future, employment, attitudes and self-concept, and home environment. Each student and dropout selected for the first follow-up was included in the second follow-up. From within the schools attended by the sample members, 1,500 twelfth grade schools were selected as sampled schools. Of the 1,500 sampled schools, the full complement of component activities occurred in 1,374 schools. For students attending schools other than those 1,374 schools, only the student and parent questionnaires were administered. Retaining the entire first follow-up sample in the 1992 round provides a maximally efficient sample for the NELS:88 second follow-up while satisfying researchers who are interested in maximizing the presence in the study of rare policy-relevant populations. The student sample was then augmented through freshening at the NELS:88 selected schools, the aim of which was to provide a representative sample of students enrolled in the twelfth grade during the spring term of the 1991-92 school year. Freshening added an additional 364 twelfth graders (of whom 243 were deemed eligible) who were not contained in the base year sampling frame, either because they were not in the county, or were not in the eighth grade in the spring term of 1988.52 Additional information about the second follow-up sample design is provided in the forthcoming NELS:88 Second Follow-Up Sample Design Report. Most in-school survey sessions were held in the period from January through March 1992, though a few took place as late as June 1992.

Central emphasis was A Profile of the American High School Senior in 1992 placed on general concepts and the development of problem-solving abilities, rather than on highly specific curriculum contentgiven the heterogeneity of the high school curriculum, the two year interval between testing, and the problem, for gain measurement, of \"forgetting\" if tests emphasize curriculum-related knowledge that is highly specific. To make them more adaptive and increase the precision of measurement, two of the tests--reading and mathematics--had multiple forms or levels; assignment to a high or low form of the 1992 test was based on performance on the 1990 test.   10th Grade High Reliability for 1992 Mathematics Test (IRT theta estimates) = .94. 12th Grade Estimates in this report pertain to the population of high school seniors in the fifty states and the District of Columbia in the spring term of the 1991-92 school year. \"Early graduates\" who completed high school ahead of their class are not included. Seniors in 1992 who in fact failed to graduate in the spring term are included (graduating seniors can be distinguished from seniors through transcript data). All estimates are approximations that are subject to sampling error. Weighted racial-ethnic proportions are based on student self-identification and may differ slightly from other sources (for example, most sources estimate Asians as a smaller proportion of the population than does NELS:88). Such differences may be attributed to any of several factors, including differences in the population definition (for example, age cohort versus students in school in senior year spring 1992), the data source (e.g., household or student self report versus teacher report or school records), or margins of sampling error arising from comparison of one weighted estimate to another. All analyses using variables taken from the student questionnaire were conducted using F2QWT. Analyses based on the contextual sample, using data contained in the school or transcript files, were conducted using the contextual weight, F2CXTWT. All analyses using transcript variables in this report are based on the responses of all seniors for whom transcripts were collected. Statistical Procedures. Comparisons that have been drawn in the text of this report have been tested for statistical significance to ensure that the differences are larger than those that might be expected due to sampling variation. The statistical comparisons in this report were based on the t statistic. Generally, whether the statistical test is considered significant or not is detennined by calculating a t value for the difference between a pair of means or proportions and comparing this value to published tables of values at certain critical levels, called \"alpha levels.\" The alpha level is an a priori statement of the probability that a difference exists in fact rather than by chance. To guard against errors of inference based upon multiple comparisons, the Bonferroni procedure53 to adjust significance tests for multiple contrasts was used. This method corrects the significance (or alpha) level for the total number of contrasts made with a particular classification variable. For each classification variable, there are (K*[K-1])/2 possible contrasts (or nonredundant pairwise comparisons), where K is the number of categories. For example, if a classification variable such as race has five categories, K=5 and there are (5.04)/2=lo possible comparisons between the categories. The Bonferroni procedure divides the alpha-level for a single t-test (in this case, 0.05; .025 is sometimes used if a two-tailed test is required) by the number of possible pairwise comparisons (10) to derive a new alpha corrected for the fact that multiple contrasts are being made. The t statistic between estimates from various subgroups presented in the tables can be computed by using the following formula: where X1 and X2 are the estimates to be compared and SE1 and SE2 are their corresponding standard errors. Standard errors for all tables are included in Appendix Two. All standard errors have been calculated using a Taylor series linearization to adjust for the effects of the complex survey design. CTAB and SUDAAN programs were used to calculate these estimates. Because NELS:88 sampling employed a multi-stage stratified cluster design, the adjusted standard errors are generally higher than those that would be calculated using normal simple random sampling assumptions.

As part of the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88), this study examined the schools attended by eighth-graders in 1988, the year during which the more than 25,000 eighth-graders of the cohort were first studied. NELS:88 provides information on 802 public schools, 105 Catholic schools, 68 other religious schools, and 60 private, non-religious school:. Throughout the report, the unit of analysis is the school rather than students or teachers. Most of the school data were provided by school administrators. The data are used to develop a profile of the schools attended by eighth-graders, with information about various aspects of the learning environment, school policies and pmgrams, and administrators' assessments of school climate. In 1988, 87.9% of eighth-graders attended public schools, 7.6% attended Catholic schools, 2.9% attended other religious schools, and 1.5% attended private non-religious schools. The study shows that eighth-graders learned under a wide range of different conditions in both public and private schools. Fifty-six data tables and five graphs are included. Appendices contain technical notes, information about the accuracy of estimates and procedures, standard errors and unweighted \"N\"s, and 56 additional tables. (119 p. Sixty tables are presented, which examine the test achievement of a natinnal probability sample of eighth graders in public and private schools. Statistics were obtained from the base-year student survey of the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88). Its purpose is to provide policy-relevant data concerning the effectiveness of schools, curriculum paths, special programs, variations in curriculum content, and/or mode of delivery in bringing about educational growth. The NELS:88 test battery includes four tests: (1) reading comprehension; (2) mathematics; (3) science; and (4) history/citizenship/government. This report is a tabular summary of achievement test scores for approximately 24,000 eighth graders from 1,052 schools. Results are grouped into: student background variables; parental involvement variables; and school characteristics and school climate. Reading and mathematics tables contain, in addition to mean scores, the percentage of each group scoring at each proficiency level and the standard error of the percentage estimate. Effect sizes are included to compare group differences.

Myers, D., and Heiser, N. Students' School Transition Patterns between Eighth and Tenth Grades Based on NELS:88, 1994; NCES 94-137. Analysis of NELS:88 data makes it possible to explore the relationships between student and family characteristics and the likelihood of shifting among public and private schools as students progress from eighth to tenth grade. This study examines the characteristics of students who switch between sectors (public to private, or private to public) as they move from eighth to tenth grade. Five sets of variables were examined to estimate the association between variations in the students' transition patterns and student and family characteristics: (1) basic student and family background characteristics; (2) the amount of parental involvement in the student's education; (3) the student's academic achievement and educational expectations; (4) the characteristics of the student's school; and (5) parental satisfaction with the student's school. Examination of these characteristics permits four research questions to be addressed: (1) How many students shift between the public and private school sectors? How many students shift from one private school to another?; (2) Who shifts between sectors? Are family background factors, parental involvement, or students' academic achievement or educational expectations associated with This report examines the background of 1992 high school seniors, the school environment which shaped their senior year experiences, the curriculum in which they were enrolled, their academic achievement, their plans and expectations for the future, and their non-academic experiences during this important period of development. Chapter 1 provides a demographic profile of high school 'seniors. Chapter 2 depicts their school and peer environment by recording seniors' perceptions of school, of the safety of their school, and of the values of their peers. Chapter 3 describes their course and program enrollments. Chapter 4 examines the tested achievement of 1992 seniors. Chapter 5 describes their short-term planstheir postsecondary plans, steps they have taken to gain entrance to college, and factors they considered in choosing a postsecondary institution. Chapter 6 reports on seniors' plans and expectations for the future. Finally, chapter 7 describes the senior cohort's experiences outside of schooluse of illicit drugs and alcohol, television viewing, jobs, participation in school government, and community volunteer work. Taken together, these seven chapters provide a statistical profile of the American high school senior in 1992. Appendices provide unweighted (sample) Ns and standard errors. This report describes the growth in cognitive skills and achievement, and the continuities and discontinuities experienced in school and at home by the NELS:88 eighth grade-cohort during the two years between the study's base year (1988) and first follow-up (1990) surveys. Four distinct topics are addressed, involving both school dropouts and persisters. (1) By 1990, some 1988 eighth graders were dropouts; this report describes their characteristics and the reasons they gave for dropping out of school. (2) This report presents findings on patterns of school transition-changing from a public eighth-grade school to a private high school or vice versa--and the changes in perception of safety and overall learning environment cohort members experienced after moving from a typically more homogeneous middle school environment to a more heterogeneous high school environment. (3) Additionally, this report summarizes major changes in home life and family, such as the divorce or remarriage of a parent, that also occurred during cohort members' transition to and/or early years of high school. (4) Finally, this report examines the 1988-90 achievement gain of the eighth-grade cohort, thus addressing several basic questions: How much did students gain in achievement in the two years following eighth grade?; This report compares the NLS-72 1972, HS&B 1980, and NELS:88 1992 senior cohorts. It supplies a sociodemographic description of the three senior cohorts. The report compares the cohorts' high school program placement, course-taking and achievement, as well as participation in extracurricular activities. It also compares 1972, 1980 and 1992 seniors' plans for the next year, noting the proportions who planned to work full-time in the year following graduation, the type of postsecondary institution seniors planned to attend, college selection, and major field of Study. Finally, the report compares the future educational and occupational aspirations of the three senior cohorts. This publication in the NCES Statistics in Brief series extends to the 1992 second follow-up the analysis of \"at risk\" factors begun by Hafner, Inge ls, Schneider, and Stevenson (1990) with the base year data and continued by Scott, Rock, Pollack and Inge Is (1995) with the first follow-up data. Approximately 26 percent of eighth grade students had an \"at risk\" characteristic and 20 percent had two or more of these risk factors. Examining the outcomes of at-risk eighth graders four years latcr (1992), Green and Scott examine both achievement outcomes and social and behavioral outcomes. With respect to achievement, Green and Scott report that (1) approximately one in six adolescents with multiple risk factors were unable to comprehend basic written information, testing below the basic level in reading in 1992. In comparison, only about one in twenty of those with no risk factors were unable to demonstrate basic reading skills. (2) At-risk students were more likely than others in 1992 to test poorly in mathematics. Over half of those with multiple risk factors tested at the basic level, or below, In contrast, only about a fifth of those with no observed risk factors tested at that level. (3) Nearly one-third of students with multiple risk factors could not demonstrate even a \"common knowledge\" of science. Only 12.2 of students with no risk factors failed to demonstrate competence at this basic level. In respect of 1992 social and behavioral outcomes, and 1992 graduation status, Green and Scott report (1) Students who had multiple risk factors in 1992 were no more likely than others to report using illicit drugs (marijuana or alcohol), or to report abusing alcohol than those with no risk factors. (2) Eighth graders who had multiple risk factors in 1988 were more likely than others to have a child in 1992--18.9 percent compared to 5.4 percent. (3) Students with multiple risk factors were more likely than others to report being suspended, and being sent to a juvenile home or detention center. However, instead of self-report data on courses completed, Rock and Pollack utilize the results of the NELS:88 high school transcript study. Rock and Pollack found that when student gains in tested mathematics achievement were cross-classified by grade in school and highest level of mathematics course taken: Slightly over 60 percent of high school students do not go beyond the algebra 2/geometry level of coursework. Approximately I out of 9 students take a calculus course while in high school; about I out of 4 students, in contrast, never go past algebra in their high school career."}, {"section_title": "9", "text": "IS N 0-16-048127-9"}]
