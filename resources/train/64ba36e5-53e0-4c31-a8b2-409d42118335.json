Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the presence of 0.001 to 1 dermatologist per 100 000 people was associated with a 35.0% reduction in the melanoma mortality rate (95% CI, 13.4%-56.6%) when compared with counties with no dermatologist.

A total of 72.8% were white, 13.2% were black or African American, 4.3% were Asian, and 0.6% were American Indian and Alaskan Native. The median age was 34.9 years, and the percentage of the population older than 65 years was 11.88%.\nPredictors of melanoma mortality are listed in the Table. Greater dermatologist density at the c ounty level is associated with lower melanoma mortality rates (Table) . The presence of 0.001 to 1 dermatologist per 100 000 people is associated with a 35.0% reduction in mortality (95% CI, 13.4%-56.6%). More than 1 to 2 dermatologists per 100 000 people is associated with a 53.0% reduction in melanoma mortality (95% CI, 30.6%-75.4%). The addition of more than 2 dermatologists per 100 000 people does not further decrease mortality rates.\nIn the reference group, the absolute melanoma mortality rate was 1.45 (95% CI, 0.71-2.18; P \u03fd .001) based on a prevalence of 19 cases per 100 000 people. The presence of 0.001 to 1 dermatologist per 100 000 people is associated with a \u22120.51 absolute reduction in mortality (P =.002), 1.001 to 2 dermatologists with a \u22120.77 absolute reduction in melanoma mortality (P \u03fd .001), 2.001 to 4.0 dermatologists with a \u22120.56 absolute reduction in melanoma mortality (P \u03fd .001), and more than 4 dermatologists with a \u22120.66 absolute reduction in melanoma mortality (P \u03fd .001).\nA slightly lower melanoma mortality rate is associated with the presence of hospitals with oncology departments (1.9%; 95% CI, 0.6%-3.1%). Metropolitan status of a county is associated with a 30.3% (95% CI, 17.3%-43.3%) reduction in the mortality rate.\nMelanoma mortality rates are greater in counties with a higher incidence of melanoma (2.3%; 95% CI, 1.6%-3.1%), greater non-Hispanic white population (1.5%; 95% CI, 1.1%-1.9%), and greater health-insured populations (1.5%; 95% CI, 0.2%-2.8%). Primary care physician density, percentage of population older than 65 years, health professional shortage area classification, percentage of population older than 25 years with a high school diploma or equivalent, median household income, and unemployment rate were parameters not associated with melanoma mortality rate.\nThere are 0 dermatologists per 100 000 people in a large portion of the country (Figure) . Greater densities of dermatologists were noted along the Pacific Coast, throughout the state of Hawaii, and in clusters along the East Coast and the Midwest. Significantly fewer dermatologists are in the central United States relative to the rest of the country."}, {"section_title": "COMMENT", "text": "In 2000, Roetzheim et al 23 found that people with limited access to care were more likely to receive a latestage melanoma diagnosis. More recent studies 24, 25 have illustrated that diagnosis by a dermatologist is associated with an earlier stage of melanoma compared with detection by a nondermatologist. Our analysis demonstrated that the presence of 0.001 to 1 dermatologist per 100 000 people is associated with a lower melanoma mortality rate by more than one-third compared with counties that lack dermatologists. We believe that this reflects that access to a dermatologist allows for an accurate and earlier diagnosis of melanoma, more appropriate therapy, or a combination of these factors. Our analysis makes the assumption that patients receive relevant health services, such as screening skin examinations, melanoma preventive education, and treatment in the county where the diagnosis was made.\nThe lowest melanoma mortality rate was observed in counties with 1.001 to 2 dermatologists per 100 000 people. However, increasing dermatologist density beyond this level did not further improve mortality rates, suggesting a plateau effect with increasing physician supply. Areas with a dermatologist density higher than 2 may represent academic centers, where dermatologists have educational and research responsibilities in addition to clinical practice. Alternatively, this plateau may not reflect access to physicians but instead may represent the limitations of our current therapeutics. Similar plateau effects have been described when relating physician density and health outcomes in the fields of urology and neonatology. 6, 7 No statistically significant differences in melanoma mortality rates were observed when comparing a dermatologist density of 1.001 to 2 dermatologists to counties with higher densities. Our analysis suggests that increasing the number of dermatologists in counties with existing physicians is unlikely to significantly alter melanoma mortality because having 2 dermatologists is not statistically significant from having 4 dermatologists when considering mortality rates. The most notable finding in our analysis demonstrates that having a single dermatologist compared with a county with 0 dermatologists reduces the mortality rate by nearly 35%. Thus, the placement of dermatologists in counties currently lacking physicians may be the most optimal approach to combating the increasing incidence of melanoma in the United States. 26 Developing incentives to attract dermatologists to underserved counties may allow us to meet this need. For example, dermatology residency positions or student loan repayments could be tied to a contract of service in an area that lacked physicians.\nOther factors associated with reduction in melanoma mortality rates are the presence of hospitals with oncology departments and metropolitan county status. Metropolitan county status is associated with a 30.27% reduction in melanoma mortality that cannot be accounted for by socioeconomic factors, including difference in educational level, age, income, or employment. In other re-0 per 100 000 people 0.001 to 1 per 100 000 people 1.001 to 2 per 100 000 people 2.001 to 4 per 100 000 people >4 per 100 000 people ports, 27, 28 socioeconomic status has been associated with stage of melanoma at diagnosis; our analysis demonstrates that these factors are not predictive of mortality.\nSeveral factors were associated with higher melanoma mortality rates. Counties with a greater incidence of melanoma and a greater percentage of whites had increased melanoma mortality rates. It is unclear why melanoma mortality rates were higher in counties with a greater percentage of health-insured individuals because other reports 2, 29, 30 have demonstrated better outcomes among insured patients. Perhaps the melanoma mortality rate is higher among the health-insured population because patients with health insurance are more likely to receive long-term disease management and are less likely to die of comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, stroke, or heart disease.\nPhysician supply may be correlated with cancer outcomes by serving as a proxy for overall health care resources. Previous studies 5 have demonstrated associations between higher numbers of primary care physicians and lower all-cause mortality, cancer mortality, and cardiovascular mortality rates. Our analysis did not find a relationship between primary care physician density and melanoma mortality. Our findings suggest that dermatologist density, which may serve as a proxy for specialists, may be a more suitable proxy for melanoma mortality than primary care physicians.\nThe limitations of this analysis include the exclusion of 669 counties due to their rural county status. These counties were excluded because limited mortality data were reported from these areas and there were few rural counties (\u03fd5%) with any dermatologists. We hypothesize that inclusion of rural counties, where the incidence of melanoma is low, would skew the analysis because the findings may imply that 0 dermatologists are associated with no melanoma mortality. However, counties where the incidence of melanoma is greater than 0 would have heightened the association we observed between dermatologist density and improved melanoma mortality.\nThe incidence data used in our analysis did not account for severity of disease at the time of diagnosis. We hypothesized that greater dermatologist density allows for disease detection at an earlier stage. Other reports have made use of the SEER database, which accounts for severity of disease at presentation; however, the merged data set used in our analysis does not reflect extent of disease at presentation. Lastly, in our analysis, no distinction was made between dermatologists engaged in clinical activities full time vs part time or in the way to account for dermatologic services provided by physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and other health care professionals.\nIn conclusion, our analysis found that within a given county, the presence of a dermatologist is associated with a lower melanoma mortality rate compared with counties that lacked a dermatologist. We speculate that efforts to recruit dermatologists to counties currently lacking such specialists could result in a population-level reduction in melanoma mortality.\nOur analysis uses melanoma mortality to highlight the consequence of a maldistributed dermatologist workforce. We have demonstrated that the geographic variation in melanoma mortality is associated with the densities of dermatologists. Given the nature of this field, it is unclear whether dermatologist density affects prevention, diagnosis, treatment, or some combination of the aforementioned. Further studies are needed using staging information to highlight whether dermatologist density is associated with earlier diagnosis of melanoma or improved treatment.
