[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Leptin, a hormone produced by body fat tissue, acts on hypothalamic receptors in the brain to regulate appetite and energy expenditure, and on neurons in the arcuate nucleus to signal that an individual has had enough to eat. Leptin enters the central nervous system at levels that depend on an individual's body fat. Obese people, on average, show greater brain atrophy in old age, so it is valuable to know whether brain atrophy relates to leptin levels, which can be targeted by interventions. We therefore determined how plasma leptin levels, and BMI, relate to brain structure, and whether leptin levels might account for BMI's effect on the brain. We measured regional brain volumes using tensor-based morphometry, in MRI scans of 517 elderly individuals with plasma leptin measured (mean: 13.3\u00b10.6 ng/ml; mean age: 75.2\u00b17.3 years; 321 men/196 women). We related plasma leptin levels to brain volumes at every location in the brain after adjusting for age, sex, and diagnosis and, later, also BMI. Plasma leptin levels were significantly higher (a) in women than men, and (b) in obese versus overweight, normal or underweight individuals. People with higher leptin levels showed deficits in frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital lobes, brainstem, and the cerebellum, irrespective of age, sex, or diagnosis. These associations persisted after controlling for BMI. Greater brain atrophy may occur in people with central leptin insufficiency, a marker of obesity. Therapeutic manipulation of leptin may be a promising direction for slowing brain decline."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Leptin is a crucially important hormone, produced by body fat, or adipose tissue [1, 2] . It regulates appetite and energy expenditure, and communicates information on fat mass and nutritional status to the brain. It acts on the hypothalamus to signal when an individual has had enough to eat, and this in turn helps to lower food intake [3] and regulate body weight [4] . Leptin also facilitates hippocampal long-term potentiation and plays a key role in learning and memory [5] . Leptin levels can be manipulated, offering a basis for some new therapeutic approaches to treat Alzheimer's disease (AD) [6] [7] [8] .\nLeptin circulates in the plasma in proportion to an individual's body fat mass, or adiposity [1] , so a natural correlation arises between plasma levels of leptin and an individual's BMI [4] . Plasma leptin enters the brain through a saturable transport system [9] , so cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of leptin do not always rise in proportion to plasma levels [4] . Elevated plasma levels of leptin may also be a sign of leptin resistance, in obese people [10] .\nWe and others have shown that higher BMI -associated with being overweight and obese -is associated with a distributed pattern of lower brain volumes in healthy elderly, and in people diagnosed with AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) [11] [12] [13] . There is a tendency for some people to lose weight when they become severely ill, but in the earlier stages of MCI and AD, and in normal aging, more overweight people tend to show greater brain atrophy.\nA small proportion of this brain atrophy is explained by carrying a very common variant in the obesity risk gene, FTO [14] , however, it is vital to identify other influential factors, as potential targets for interventions. As plasma leptin levels are associated with BMI, we decided to use three-dimensional (3D) brain morphometry to relate plasma leptin levels to regional volumes at every location in the brain. We discovered a detailed 3D anatomical pattern of structural brain differences associated with leptin levels, and we tested if any effects persisted after accounting for BMI.\nData used in preparing this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.ucla.edu).

Each scan involved a 3D sagittal magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo sequence (MP-RAGE) with the following parameters: repetition time (2400 ms), flip angle (81), inversion time (1000 ms), 24 cm field of view, a 192 \u00c2 192 \u00c2 166 acquisition matrix, and a voxel size of 1.25 \u00c2 1.25 \u00c2 1.2 mm 3 , later reconstructed to 1 mm isotropic voxels.

All preprocessed MR images were nonlinearly aligned to the study-specific template so that they would all share a common coordinate system defined by the MDT. The local expansion or compression factor of the 3D elastic warping transform [20] (sometimes called the 'Jacobian determinant'), was plotted for each individual.

To adjust its distribution to be closer to Normal, we used a logarithm transformation of the measured values for leptin ( Fig. 1b) .\nAt each image voxel within the brain, a multiple regression analysis was run to test for statistical associations between regional brain volumes and log 10 (leptin) levels across all the individuals, after adjusting for age, sex, and diagnosis ( Fig. 2a ); we also subsequently tested for effects within each of the AD, MCI, and control groups (Fig. 2b-d ). In the same regression model, we also analyzed statistical associations after covarying for BMI, to test the hypothesis that associations were being driven solely by BMI.\nIn addition to adiposity, insulin and sex differencesincluding sex hormone levels -affect plasma leptin concentrations [21] . So we also analyzed associations after adjusting for insulin and testosterone levels, in addition to age, sex, diagnosis, and BMI.\nWe created 3D statistical brain maps to show regions where brain volume associations were significantly associated with leptin. To control for false positives, we enforced a standard false discovery rate correction for multiple statistical comparisons across voxels in the brain, using the conventionally accepted false positive rate of 5% (q = 0.05)."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Demographic characteristics", "text": "The average morning plasma leptin levels in the ADNI cohort were 13.3\u00b10.6 ng/ml.

As in prior studies [22, 23] , women (n = 196; 20.5\u00b11.5 ng/ml) showed higher average leptin levels than men (n = 321; 8.9\u00b10.5 ng/ml; P < 0.0001). Obese individuals [24] (n = 116; 22.7\u00b1 1.6 ng/ml) showed greater leptin levels than groups of overweight (n = 236; 13.9\u00b10.8 ng/ml), normal (n = 190; 7.8\u00b10.5 ng/ml), or underweight individuals (n = 3; 2.8\u00b10.5 ng/ml). As expected, plasma leptin levels were positively correlated with BMI, after controlling for age and sex (P < 0.0001)."}, {"section_title": "Leptin and brain volumes", "text": "In a linear regression analysis across all individuals, covarying for age, sex, and diagnostic group, regional brain volumes were associated with leptin levels, with deficits detected in the frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital lobes, brainstem, and the cerebellum. Some volume excess relative to the MDT was noted in the peripheral CSF spaces with an increase in leptin levels (Fig. 2a) . This is expected, as CSF spaces expand with greater brain atrophy.\nA subgroup analysis revealed similar significant leptinassociated regional brain volume deficits in AD, MCI, and control groups individually ( Fig. 2b-d) . The larger MCI group showed deficits over a broad region of the brain, relative to the MDT.\nThe above-described leptin-brain volume associations continued to exist after adjusting for BMI, insulin, testosterone, in the full ADNI group -and in the MCI group alone -but not in the AD and the control groups, although they showed a similar trend.\nWe found no significant effect of carrying the APOE4 genotype on leptin levels, suggesting that the leptin effects were not tracking a latent genotypic difference in the major AD risk gene, APOE."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The higher plasma leptin concentrations in women than men are most likely due to sex differences in body fat, sex hormones, and insulin levels [22, 23] .\nAutomated whole brain volumetric analysis of brain MRI revealed a 3D pattern of strong associations between plasma leptin levels and regional brain volume deficits in the frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital lobes, brainstem, and the cerebellum. These links with leptin levels were found (a) across all individuals ( Fig. 2a and b ) in separate analyses of each diagnostic group specifically ( Fig. 2b-d) . These very regions were shown earlier to be associated with obesity and higher BMI [11] [12] [13] . Among the subgroups, MCI individuals showed larger areas of association between leptin levels and brain, and continued to show significant associations with brain volumes after controlling for BMI, unlike the AD or the control groups. This is most likely due to the larger sample size for the MCI group (MCI, n = 354 versus AD, n = 110 and controls, n = 53); ADNI enrolls over twice as many MCI individuals as people with AD or elderly controls, so the larger available MCI sample offered greater power to detect associations.\nIn normal individuals, some studies have reported that elevated plasma leptin is associated with reduced incidence of AD and with larger total cerebral brain volume. This paradoxical effect is thought to be due to some beneficial effects of leptin on the brain, in nonobese individuals [25] . However, our results showing significant brain deficits associated with plasma leptin in the full ADNI group and the MCI group of individuals, regardless of their diagnosis or BMI, possibly track the effects of leptin resistance or inefficiency, a marker of obesity.\nThe findings from our study may improve understanding of the consequences of having elevated leptin levels in the plasma, and the potential benefits of therapies [6] [7] [8] targeted to improve CSF/plasma leptin ratios [9] .\nEven though ADNI is not the most ideal sample to carry out this analysis, it is a good test bed because of the availability of data for plasma leptin, high-resolution MRI scans of the brain, and well-validated computational methods for volume quantification in a large and welldefined cohort. A minor weakness was that we did not manipulate leptin levels, so it is impossible to say whether leptin caused the brain differences, or whether leptin measures are correlated with other factors that damage the brain; importantly, however, the leptin effect persists after adjusting for BMI, and high BMI is associated with greater brain atrophy. A larger interventional design is needed to resolve this."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "The relationship between leptin and brain volumes is an intriguing one with central leptin being neuroprotective Brain deficits were detected in people with higher levels of the fat-mass-associated hormone, leptin.
