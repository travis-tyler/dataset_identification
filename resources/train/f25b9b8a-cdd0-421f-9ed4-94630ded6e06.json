The potential hazards to this vital, vibrant 70-mile stretch of California coastline compel city planners and decision-makers to develop coastal resilience initiatives by conducting vulnerability assessments and considering potential adaptation strategies. Nexus Planning & Research was tasked with providing a comparative benefit-cost analysis of coastal resilience strategies for participating cities in San Diego County, following the framework outlined in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) funded study, What Will Adaptation Cost? An Economic Framework for Coastal Community Infrastructure (NOAA, 2013). Specifically, we were directed to comparatively assess the trade-offs (spending vs. benefits) of various coastal resilience strategies, as identified by participating jurisdictions. Ultimately, the City of Carlsbad and the City of Del Mar were the two jurisdictions that participated in this study. We evaluated the potential damage or loss to \"at-risk\" properties from sea level rise, and the cost of protecting, adapting, or abandoning those properties. The intent of this study is to compare the cost and benefits of sea level rise action scenarios, using benefit-cost ratios. This report is part of a larger, multifaceted project led by the San Diego Regional Climate Collaborative, a partnership of local and regional agencies and groups. The project, \"Connecting the Dots and Building Coastal Resilience in the San Diego Region,\" was funded through the NOAA Coastal Resilience Grants Program, a federally funded opportunity for coastal communities to prepare for changing sea levels and extreme storm events. Our study expressly followed the NOAA framework with the intent of: 1) Testing the methodology, 2) Utilizing the participating jurisdictions as case studies, and 3) Providing lessons learned. While the NOAA framework focuses on coastal flooding, we also evaluated bluff erosion and chronic inundation where applicable. (We did not evaluate river flooding.) In addition, the analysis incorporated a high-level overview of potential fiscal impacts to the participating cities. The purpose of the NOAA framework is to provide benefit-cost ratios for comparing multiple sea level rise adaptation strategies or scenarios. Following that approach, the intent of this study was to compare action scenarios for a specified geographic area consisting of one or more sea level rise adaptation strategies. The strategies within the action scenarios fall into three categories: natural or engineered protection (beach nourishment or armoring with structures), accommodation (raising structures), and managed retreat (removing structures). We collected existing units and construction costs for selected adaptation strategies, developed cost estimates for the action scenarios, and applied them temporally as indicated by the respective jurisdictional schedules. The project life for the economic analysis depends on the adaptation strategy employed within the action scenario."}, {"section_title": "Results of the Cost-Benefit Study", "text": "A primary output of this study is the comparative assessment of the trade-offs (spending vs. benefits) of the action scenarios as identified by participating jurisdictions. To evaluate the trade-offs, we first developed cost inputs to the model, including: 1. Monetized baseline risk primary and secondary impacts, which represent the maximum damages prevented, or the \"no action\" scenario 2. Monetized impacts resulting from action scenarios 3. Implementation costs of adaptation strategies 4. Benefits of each action scenario (damages prevented) 5. Capital and maintenance costs of action scenarios After inputting the costs into the model, we calculated the net benefits and benefit-cost ratios for the action scenarios. The benefit-cost ratio is the net present value (NPV) of total benefits divided by NPV of total costs. The benefit-cost ratio is used for comparing action scenarios and determining whether the benefits outweigh the cost. The following section details the outcome of the benefit-cost comparison. For more information about each action scenario, see the \"Assess What You Can Do Differently: Adaptation Scenarios and Strategies\" chapter in this report. As shown in Table 1 and Table 2, the net benefits are the NPV of total benefits, minus the NPV of total costs. For Carlsbad and Del Mar, all of the benefit-cost ratios are higher than 1, meaning the benefits are greater than the costs. For Carlsbad, Scenario 1 has the greatest return on investment. For every $1.00 spent, there is a return of $72.88. Scenario 2 has a return of $28.12 for every dollar spent, and Scenario 3's return in $56.97. These ratios assume that the three action scenarios are equally effective at preventing damages. This assumption is varied in the sensitivity analysis. For Del Mar, Scenario 1a has the greatest return on investment. For every $1.00 spent, there is a return of $8.48. Scenario 1b has a return of $7.17 for every dollar spent, and Scenario 2's return in $4.94. Again, these ratios assume that the three action scenarios are equally effective at preventing damages. The robustness of these results is tested in the sensitivity analysis. While we did not incorporate qualitative considerations into our analyses, city planners and decisionmakers would want to consider the implications of non-monetized benefits or costs. Additionally, per the NOAA framework, each city should consider funding feasibility when deciding among action scenarios."}, {"section_title": "Sensitivity Analysis", "text": "We conducted sensitivity analysis to test the robustness of our results. That is, even if we modified some of our assumptions, would Scenario 1 and Scenario 1a still have the most return on the investment? We tested assumptions related to the following: equal effectiveness of action scenarios, discount rate, loss of property tax revenue in Del Mar Scenario 2, and loss of beach tourism and city tax revenue. We found that our results were robust to all of the assumptions, except those related to effectiveness and the discount rate.\nWe conducted sensitivity analysis to test the robustness of our results. That is, even if we modified some of our assumptions would Scenario 1 and Scenario 1a still have the most return on the investment? We did not test baseline model assumptions because each city's action scenarios started with the same baseline model and those same assumptions were applied equally. Although, baseline model assumptions could result different returns of investment for an action scenario, our project's scope was only to compare action scenarios, not estimate precise net benefits for each one. Thus, we only tested the key assumptions that could result in differences between or among the action scenarios. We varied the following assumptions to test the robustness of our results. Key parameters tested: \u2022 Protection factor (effectiveness) \u2022 Discount rate \u2022 Loss of property tax revenue in Del Mar Scenario 2 (negative impact) \u2022 Loss of beach tourism revenue and city tax revenue in Carlsbad Scenario 1 and Del Mar Scenario 1b (negative impact) By entering different parameter values into the model, we calculated several benefit-cost ratios. The results of our analysis are found in this chapter."}, {"section_title": "Effectiveness (Protection Factor)", "text": "We found that for both cities, the initial results were not robust to assumptions about effectiveness. The protection factor was varied using 25 percent, 50 percent, and 75 percent effectiveness levels and compared to the results at a 100 percent effectiveness level. We assumed that each action scenario prevented damages equally by setting a protection factor of 100 percent, i.e., it prevents against all baseline risk damages. However, as Figure 1 and Figure 2 show, if Carlsbad Scenario 1 and Del Mar Scenario 1a are not as effective as the other action scenarios, then they might not be the most costeffective choice. Figure 1 shows that while Carlsbad Scenario 1 (beach nourishment and groins) initially appears to be the best choice, that ranking depends upon its effectiveness. For example, if Scenario 1 is less effective, e.g. 75 percent effective at preventing baseline damages, and Scenario 3 (beach nourishment, raise/improve seawalls and revetments) is 100 percent effective, then Scenario 3 has the higher benefit-cost ratio (56.97 versus 54.66). In Del Mar, we find a similar circumstance ( Figure 2). Scenario 1a (beach nourishment and groins) has the highest benefit-cost ratio when all scenarios are assumed to have the same effectiveness. However, if Scenario 1a is less effective, e.g. 75 percent effective at preventing damages and Scenario 1b is 100 percent effective, then Scenario 1b is more cost-effective (7.17 versus 6.36). "}, {"section_title": "Discount Rate", "text": "Because action scenarios could incur costs on different timeframes, various discount rates could also alter study results. When cities undertake similar analyses with adaption strategy implementation of distinct timelines that extend in the far future, they should carefully consider which discount rate to apply, or conduct similar sensitivity analysis before making a decision. We assumed a one percent discount rate, (as found in other similar studies,) however, because the timeline of the adaptation strategies and negative benefits differed by action scenarios, it was pertinent to test our discount rate assumption. Discount rates of two percent and three percent were compared to the results at a one percent discount rate. In Carlsbad, we found that our initial results were not robust to the discount rate assumption (Figure 3). While the Scenario 1 benefit-cost ratio (72.88) is the highest when assuming a one percent discount rate, Scenario 3's ratio (45.87) is higher than Scenario 1's ratio (44.28) when the discount rate is three percent. This ranking change is due to Scenario 1 having the higher implementation costs early on, while Scenario 3's costs are spread out across decades. Del Mar's initial results, on the other hand, are robust. As shown in Figure 4, the sensitivity analysis of the discount rate does not change the ratio rankings. Scenario 1a has the highest benefit-cost ratio across all three discount rates.  Ultimately, cities will need to consider benefit-cost ratios for each of their action scenarios, as well as their own city's culture and character. In Carlsbad, Scenario 1 and Scenario 3 both show strong returns on investment, but planners might be inclined to choose Scenario 3 if they are concerned that the groin construction in Scenario 1 could negatively impact local surfing. Del Mar could select to engineer groins, as in their Scenario 1a, over Scenario 1b's raising or improving their seawalls, even though the results were not robust to effectiveness assumptions. For both cities, coastal resiliency choices should not only weigh short-term and long-term cost, but also reflect the communities' values and identity.\nAs described earlier, it is important to discount future dollars because a dollar today is considered worth more than it will be in the future. To make fair comparisons, all dollars should be discounted to present value. Economists use different discount rates. In our case, we assumed one percent because it has been used in similar studies (Nature Conservancy, 2016). However, because the timeline of the adaptation strategies and negative benefits differed by action scenarios, it was pertinent to test our discount rate assumption. Costs that occur in the far future may be less than those that occur in the near future. Discount rates of two percent and three percent were compared to the results at a one percent discount rate. In Carlsbad, we found that are initial results were not robust to the discount rate assumption ( Figure  17). While the Scenario 1 benefit-cost ratio (72.88) is the highest when assuming a one percent discount rate, Scenario 3's ratio (45.87) is higher than Scenario 1's ratio (44.28) when the discount rate is three percent. This ranking change is due to Scenario 1 having the higher implementation costs early on, while Scenario 3's costs are spread out more across decades. Del Mar's initial results, on the other hand, are robust to the discount rate assumption. As shown in Figure 18, the sensitivity analysis of the discount rate does not change the ratio rankings. Scenario 1a has the highest benefit-cost ratio across all three discount rates. Next, we considered the loss of property tax revenue in Scenario 2. This analysis only applies to Del Mar because structures were not removed in the Carlsbad action scenarios. In Del Mar, property taxes were assumed to be lost at 100 percent for the first row of beach homes removed in 2040. We continued to assume that it would be lost at 100 percent throughout the whole period, up to 2100. However, it is possible that those who lost homes could potentially build new homes within the city limits and some of the tax revenue would relocate within the city. We tested this assumption by computing ratios that assumed 25 percent, 50 percent, and 75 percent of the tax revenue was lost. Table 31 shows that our initial results were robust to this assumption. Even if only 25 percent of the property tax revenue was lost for Scenario 2, Scenario 1a would still have a higher rate of return (8.48) than Scenario 2 (5.00). In fact, this assumption only slightly impacts Scenario 2's initial ratio (4.94).

NOAA's framework offers different approaches to the benefit-cost analyses based on factors such as the goals of a study, technical knowledge and expertise, and data availability. While this study followed one general approach provided in NOAA's framework, we did take additional steps to modify the methodology or verify data accuracy when specific information was not available or directly applicable. The \"Lessons Learned\" attempts to capture our professional experience with implementation of NOAA's framework, and the information revealed during application of the additional steps. 1. The NOAA Framework. We found the broad, flexible approach of the NOAA Framework adaptable to meet each of our city's needs, however, the trade-off was a lack of specificity. As such, it provides little direction regarding assumptions that are specific to a city's unique characteristics or needs. For example, post-flood clean-up costs may be additional costs to the city or incorporated into the existing budget. Practitioners attempting to apply the NOAA framework will need to make decisions about the most appropriate dollar values to apply, or the size and location of specific adaptation strategies (see #2 below). Additionally, the NOAA framework is presented as a linear process, but in practice, performing the tasks is a nonlinear endeavor. Utilizing multiple team members, different tasks can be performed simultaneously as some tasks do not need to occur in the same order as presented in the framework. However, we recommend practitioners have the technical knowledge and expertise to adjust and revise the approach. 2. Project and site-specific information is necessary to provide more detailed cost estimates. Adaptation strategies are dependent on geographic and oceanic conditions specific to an area. As a result, options for adaptation strategies can vary widely depending on existing conditions and the goals of the adaptation strategy. Additionally, labor, materials and seasonal considerations will inevitably vary, nationally. We found historic city expenditures and quoted estimates from local resources and vendors to be better cost indicators than those obtained via out-of-region projects, other studies or generic software packages. 3. The value of GIS and parcel level information versus geographically aggregated approach. collaboration necessary and vital to the project schedule, and setting (or resetting) project expectations.\nThe intent of these \"Lessons Learned\" is to provide future practitioners with additional information and guidance that may help to focus and refine their own implementation of NOAA's framework for greater efficiency and effectiveness.

This study describes our process for incorporating both types of vulnerability assessments into the NOAA framework."}, {"section_title": "Action Scenarios", "text": "Del Mar provided a plan outlining action scenarios to prevent future sea level rise damages. Each action scenario identified one or more combined sea level adaptation strategies. The purpose of the NOAA framework is to provide benefit-cost ratios for comparing multiple sea level rise adaptation strategies or scenarios. Del Mar provided multiple action scenarios for only one area located between the Solana Beach border to the north and 29th Street to the south, known as North Beach. Therefore, we were only able to assess the North Beach area. As only a single bluff erosion action scenario was provided in the Del Mar Adaptation Plan, it was not included in our analysis. As previously mentioned, we were not tasked with evaluating the river flooding action scenarios. At the time of this study, Carlsbad had not completed an adaptation plan, and therefore was unable to provide action scenarios or adaptation strategies unique to its jurisdiction. Through discussion with Carlsbad city planners, we were directed to adapt and apply Del Mar's North Beach action scenarios to the northern portion of Carlsbad's beach area: Planning Zone 1. While Buena Vista Lagoon is within Planning Zone 1, the city asked us to exclude the lagoon from our analyses. Therefore, the Carlsbad analysis focuses on only the coastal area of Planning Zone 1, referred to as the \"Selected Study Area, Planning Zone 1.\" The Del Mar and Carlsbad action scenarios contain different variations of the following adaptation strategies: Nicknamed, \"The Village by the Sea,\" Carlsbad is a resort community that features seven miles of beach and coastal bluffs, inland hills, and a semi-arid Mediterranean climate. Carlsbad's total area of 39.1 square miles is comprised of 37.7 square miles of land, and 1.4 square miles of water due to its three lagoons and one lake, and has an elevation of 52 feet above sea level. The majority of residences in Carlsbad consist of single-family homes and newer, high-end planned communities. According to realtor.com, the median closing price for all home types in Carlsbad, as of March 2017, was $745,000. According to the California State Department of Finance (DOF), Carlsbad's population is estimated to be 112,930 as of January 1, 2016, with a density of 2,995 people per square mile. According to the 2015 1year American Community Survey, 73.1 percent of Carlsbad households are families, 46.4 percent of which have children under 18. The racial composition is mostly non-Hispanic White (76 percent), followed by 11 percent Hispanic or Latino, 9 percent Asian, approximately 3 percent Pacific Islander or other races, respectively, and less than 1 percent African American. More than half of Carlsbad residents are young Baby Boomers and Generation X: Almost 53 percent are 25 to 64 years old. Forty percent of all residents have a bachelor's degree or higher and the median household income is $96,300, with almost 30 percent of households earning $150,000 or more. In addition to its coastline, Carlsbad has an abundance of natural recreation resources include the southern shore of Buena Vista Lagoon, the Agua Hedionda lagoon, Batiquitos Lagoon, 13 community parks, and over 50 miles of hiking trails across more than 6,000 acres of permanent nature preserves and areas. Other leisure attractions include LEGOLAND California theme and water parks, three golf courses, and the downtown \"Village\" district of shops and restaurants, making tourism a major contributor to Carlsbad's economy."}, {"section_title": "City of Carlsbad Sea Level Rise Vulnerability Assessment", "text": "Understanding Carlsbad's vulnerability to sea level rise provides city planners and decision-makers with the knowledge needed to lessen the city's exposure to coastal hazards. Planning for future coastal events is complex and highly predictive; therefore, the City of Carlsbad Sea Level Rise Vulnerability Assessment draft (City of Carlsbad, 2016) (Carlsbad Assessment) uses high and low sea level rise estimates to account for a range of scenarios. The United States Geologic Survey's (USGS) Coastal Storm Modeling System (CoSMoS) was used to define and visualize three types of hazard zones for 2050 and 2100 planning horizons. According to the Carlsbad Assessment, \"The CoSMoS 0.5m and 2.0m sea level rise scenarios roughly align with the projected high sea level rise from the 2012 National Research Council's report for the same planning horizons.\" Therefore, the 2050 and 2100 sea level rise scenario results were used as the basis for the Carlsbad Assessment. We considered three types of hazard zones: 1. Inundation: An area that will be subject to recurrent \"wetting and drying\" as higher daily tides advance inland."}, {"section_title": "Coastal Flood:", "text": "In addition to rising tidal hazards, some areas will experience event flooding due to extreme wave action caused by coastal storms. A 100-year storm event (a storm with a statistical 1% chance of occurring in any given year) was used to define this zone. The use of 100-year storm events has historical precedence in sea level rise literature when considering physical impacts from sea level rise from extreme events and storms (California Coastal Commission, 2015;NOAA, 2010). 3. Bluff: Carlsbad's shoreline includes coastal bluffs where rising sea levels will cause contact with daily tides or exposure to increased wave action, resulting in erosion. The Carlsbad Assessment divided the Carlsbad shoreline into three Planning Zones (Zones) to create manageable areas of examination. The length of shoreline within the Zones ranged from 1.4 to 2.4 miles, with each zone containing one of the three lagoons within Carlsbad city limits: the southern portion of Buena Vista Lagoon, Agua Hedionda Lagoon, or Batiquitos Lagoon. The Carlsbad Assessment provides an inventory of potentially affected assets including beaches, public works infrastructure, transportation infrastructure, state parks, environmentally sensitive lands, public access ways, and residential parcels. These assets were rated low, moderate, or high for their hazard exposure, impact sensitivity, and adaptive capacity."}, {"section_title": "City of Carlsbad Sea Level Rise Adaptation Strategies and Study Area", "text": "At the time of this study, Carlsbad had not selected action scenarios or adaptation strategies.

"}, {"section_title": "Del Mar", "text": "The City of Del Mar is a small beach city located on the Pacific coast in northern San Diego County. Long and narrow with an elevation of 112 feet above sea level, Del Mar's 18.1 square miles include approximately 2.5 miles of coast and an inland width of less than one mile at its widest point. Del Mar has a small downtown village and three beaches. North Beach (commonly known as Dog Beach) is adjacent to the Scripps Bluff Preserve at the San Dieguito River outlet. North Del Mar Beach features two oceanfront public parks, whereas south Del Mar Beach is characterized by steep, high coastal bluffs and undeveloped stretches. Del Mar has a Mediterranean-subtropical climate with warm, dry summers and mild winters. Del Mar is also the home of the Del Mar Fairgrounds, host of the Del Mar Races, the San Diego County Fair, and other large regional events. According to California DOF, Del Mar's population is estimated to be 4,274 (236 people/square mile) as of January 1, 2016. According to the 2011-2015 American Community Survey its population is 84 percent non-Hispanic white, 13 percent Hispanic or Latino, 2 percent Asian, and less than 1 percent of all other surveyed races, each. Of Del Mar's 2,125 households, 15 percent have children under 18-years-old living in them. Over 60 percent of Del Mar residents are 25 to 64 years old, making late Baby Boomers and Generation X the two largest demographic groups. Sixty-four percent of all residents have a bachelor's degree of higher and the median household income in Del Mar is $107,000, more than double the national median income for the same year. The majority of Del Mar residences are single-family homes, many of which are beachfront properties. Due to its small size, Del Mar is essentially \"built-out\" with little room for further development. According to realtor.com, the median closing price for a home in Del Mar was over $1.6 million, as of March 2017. Because of its shape, location and size, the City of Del Mar is especially impacted by coastal and river flooding, and beach and bluff erosion. The northern portion of the city, which includes the Del Mar Fairgrounds, lies within the San Dieguito River floodplain. Sea level rise will likely increase the severity and frequency of such risks.\nApplying the Method The Del Mar Assessment differed in its approach, compared to the Carlsbad Assessment, by projecting the increase in flooding occurrences over time, instead of water level increases. The Del Mar Assessment used flooding return probabilities and damages from past storm events to predict future impacts of coastal flooding. A \"significant event\" had the same impacts as their 2016 storm, which the Del Mar Assessment considered to be a high sea level rise 10-year storm event. An \"extreme event\" referenced the damages from their 1983 storm and was considered to be a high sea level rise 100-year storm event. Additionally, the Del Mar Assessment used CoSMoS v3.0 to estimate the loss in shoreline due to chronic inundation. Table 7 shows the how the coastal flooding annual probabilities increase over time for the high sea level rise scenario. By 2050, today's 10-year event will be 1-year event. By 2100, today's 100-year event will be a 1-year event. \nApplying the Method\nScenarios 1a and 1b in the Del Mar Adaptation Plan recommend removal of the first row of structures directly adjacent to the beach, starting in 2100. Scenario 2 recommends removal of homes starting in 2040. We estimated the fiscal impacts of temporary and/or long-term loss of real property and associated services resulting from increased coastal flooding and chronic inundation of North Beach. The analysis focused on the loss of tax revenue generators, specifically property tax, sales and use tax (from the purchase of goods), TOT revenue from hotel/motel expenditures, and vehicle license in-lieu fees. Our analysis specifically addresses revenue impact to the city's General Fund resulting from: \u2022 Potential interruptions of business operations caused by short-to medium-term coastal flooding \u2022 Loss of city tax revenue associated with loss of beach \u2022 The removal of the first row of homes and commercial establishments directly adjacent to the beach\nSignificant and extreme storm events may temporarily interrupt business operations. Because we did not have high-water depths data, we used Table 2 of the Del Mar Adaptation Plan and the high 100 percent risk value for significant and extreme events to select corresponding levels of sea level rise.\nLike Carlsbad, Del Mar would receive sales tax revenues from purchases made by visitors to the local retail establishments. According to the State Board of Equalization (2016a), the city receives sales tax revenues equal to 0.95 percent of the local taxable expenditures that occur within the city limits. There are two commercial restaurants in North Beach. Under California law, foods eaten on the premise of an eatery are taxed, while the same item taken \"to-go\" is not. Estimates for sales tax revenue for the restaurants assume all food is consumed on the premises, and therefore subject to sales tax.\nThe transient occupancy tax (hotel, motel, campground, or bed tax) is authorized under State Revenue and Taxation Code Section 7280 as an additional source of non-property tax revenue to local government. Del Mar levies a transient occupancy tax at a rate of 12.5 percent of room rental revenue. North Beach includes one 43-room limited service motel, the Del Mar Motel. Our research indicates that non-holiday asking rates at the Del Mar Motel range from approximately $169 to $209 per night for a standard room. We have projected transient occupancy tax assuming a 65 percent occupancy rate and an average daily rate (ADR) of $189.\nProperty taxes are a key source of Del Mar's General Fund revenues, as well as the primary revenue source for a number of special districts. Property taxes are applicable to real property, defined as land and the buildings attached to it, and certain types of personal property, including furniture, fixtures, and equipment (FF&E) owned by businesses. 10 Property in California is subject to a base 1.0 percent property tax rate, which is shared among various local jurisdictions including the county, city, and special districts, as well as the state, which is allocated a portion of funds known as Education Revenue Augmentation Funds (ERAF). The County of San Diego Controller's Office is the responsible agency for calculation of property tax assessment and corresponding allocation of revenues. Shifting of ERAF funds is performed by the county and therefore not recalculated here. In addition to the base 1.0 percent property tax rate, North Beach is subject to supplemental property taxes to pay for bonds issued for parks and recreation, school district, and community college district purposes. Supplemental property taxes are restricted for specific uses and apply only to real property, and not to business personal property. This analysis focuses on the city's General Fund revenues and does not calculate supplemental taxes for non-discretionary services. The potential loss of tax revenue generated by at-risk Del Mar residential coastal property represents an accurate and meaningful way to quantify the tangible costs of increased coastal flooding caused by sea level rise. Property taxes comprise an average of about 34 percent of all revenue collected by the City (City of Del Mar, 2015). North Beach is located in Tax Rate Area (TRA) 011001 and is allocated 14.78 percent of the 1.0 percent property tax revenue for 2016-2017 (San Diego County, 2016-2017. For example, the loss of a coastal property in TRA 011001 assessed at $1 million; therefore, would result in an annual loss of $1,478 (2015$) in property tax revenue to the city.  [2005][2006], former VLF revenues were swapped for ILVLF revenues, which set the local jurisdiction's ILVLF \"base.\" The base increases each year thereafter in proportion to the increase in total assessed valuation within the jurisdiction. For example, if total assessed valuation increases by five percent from one year to the next, the ILVLF base and resulting revenues would increase by five percent. In order to calculate the incremental decrease in ILVLF revenues that would result from the removal of the first row of residential structures, we first determined the total assessed value within the city, and the city's current ILVLF revenues. The analysis then determined the percentage by which the removal of structures would decrease the city's assessed valuation, and applied the percentage to the current ILVLF revenues in order to determine the incremental amount of ILVLF attributable to the removal of structures. The adaptation scenarios 1a, 1b, and 2 would generate a 3.4 percent decrease in the city's total assessed value, which would result in adaptation scenario-generated ILVLF revenue of an equivalent reduction.\nFor all Del Mar action scenarios, we assumed beach nourishment would begin in 2030, with subsequent replenishments occurring once every ten years. For Scenario 1a, we assume nourishments subsequent to groin construction would be one half of the initial nourishment. For Scenario 1b and 2, we assumed all nourishments will be equal to the initial nourishment value.\nIn the case of Del Mar's Scenario 1b, we assumed the first replacement would occur in 2040 with subsequent replacement in 2070 and 2090. We then assumed revetment maintenance ever ten years following reconstruction of the revetment resulting in maintenance costs at 2050, 2060, 2080, and 2100.\nIn the case of Del Mar's Scenario 1b, we assumed the first replacement would occur in 2040 with subsequent replacement in 2070 and 2100."}, {"section_title": "City of Del Mar Coastal Hazards, Vulnerability, and Risk Assessment", "text": "Del Mar's Coastal Hazards, Vulnerability, and Risk Assessment draft (City of Del Mar, 2016a) (Del Mar Assessment) provides a detailed analysis of the city's vulnerabilities and risk from three coastal hazards: coastal flooding, coastal erosion (referred to as chronic inundation in our study), bluff erosion, and river flooding. The Del Mar Assessment examined various asset categories, such as parcels, city structures, and roads. Coastal flooding and erosion vulnerabilities were examined using historical storm event and damage data, and estimated the increased likelihood of greater and more frequent damage, in accordance with upper-end sea level rise scenarios for 2030, 2050, 2070, and 2100, and preliminary data from the US Geological Survey's Coastal Storm Modeling System (CoSMoS) v3.0 predictions for a 100-year (1% chance of occurring) extreme coastal flood.

It can be used for assessing infrastructure broadly throughout the city, or a portion thereof, which is known as the holistic approach. Or, it can be used on one specific piece of infrastructure, such as a power plant. This is known as the priority infrastructure approach. We follow the holistic infrastructure approach because we are evaluating impacts to multiple infrastructures within specific geographic areas of the city. The NOAA framework also has an impact assessment and risk assessment option. Each city should choose which option to pursue before beginning their analysis. Per the framework, the impact assessment estimates coastal flooding damages only using water depth, while the risk assessment uses water depth plus the probability of flooding events occurring, i.e., 10-year storm event.

This initial geographic extent assessment, along with the more detailed primary and secondary impacts developed in the \"Costs and Benefits\" chapter answers the question, \"What would happen if no adaption measures were put in place to mitigate or protect against future sea level rise?\" This is the \"no action\" scenario when evaluating costs and benefits."}, {"section_title": "Understand Your Baseline Risk", "text": "To be consistent with each city's documents, we selected the sea level rise scenario and hazard impacts identified in their vulnerability assessments. 2 We did not conduct any separate hazard modeling.

Our analysis of Del Mar only included coastal flooding and beach loss due to chronic inundation for the North Beach area because it was the only area with multiple action scenarios that fell within the scope of this project. 3"}, {"section_title": "Assessing What You Can Do Differently", "text": "Once a city identifies its baseline risk, it can establish adaptation strategies and action scenarios. Adaptation strategies are those tactics that a city can employ to lessen or protect against sea level rise damages. An action scenario is a combination of one or more adaptation strategies. For example, in one of its action scenarios, Del Mar chose to raise or improve their seawall, replenish the beach's sand, and eventually, remove the impacted residential and commercial structures. These three strategies combine to create one action scenario. We opted to be consistent with each city's plans and not release a study that could be misconstrued as an alternative plan. As Carlsbad did not have an adaptation study or plan from which to draw, we coordinated with Carlsbad planners and followed their direction for the selection of adaptation scenarios and geographic application. As already stated, we only analyzed the cost and benefits for those geographic areas with more than one action scenario, in adherence with the NOAA's framework to compare two or more scenarios, rather than establish the net benefits of one. The next step in NOAA's process is to reevaluate the city's impact from sea level rise with each action scenario in place. Since environmental modeling of coastal sea level rise impacts fell outside of the scope of this project and our expertise, we were unable to reassess impacts. Rather, the final costbenefit model incorporates a protection or effectiveness factor, ranging from 0 -100 percent, that can be altered using information provided by experts. For example, this factor could be set to 100 percent if the action scenario is expected to prevent all sea level rise impacts, or it could be set to 75 percent if it is expected to prevent most, but not all, impacts. This protection factor allows analysts to compare action scenarios based on their assumed effectiveness. For our analyses, we set that factor to 100 percent for all action scenarios because we did not have the expertise to make a judgment about each action scenario's effectiveness. However, we tested the robustness of the effectiveness assumption in our sensitivity analysis (described later in the \"Sensitivity Analysis\" chapter)."}, {"section_title": "Calculating Costs and Benefits", "text": "The purpose of this component is to monetize (assign a dollar value) the baseline (no action scenario), then re-assess impacts for each action scenario and estimate the costs of implementing each adaptation strategy within the action scenarios. These data will be used in the \"Making a Decision: Results\" chapter to compute benefit-cost ratios that compare relative return on investment for each action scenario, including the baseline scenario with no action. Identifying impacts was the first task in this process. Using each city's vulnerability assessment, we created a list of primary and secondary impacts within the predetermined asset categories that fell in the hazard zones. After the city identified their action scenarios, we also considered any additional positive or negative impacts associated with one action scenario over another. For example, Del Mar selected an action scenario that protected the beach across all years, and another where the beach was lost in later years. We accounted for these different impacts in the benefits side of the ratio. Next, we assigned monetary values to the primary and secondary impacts. While we primarily quantified the costs to the city, we also estimated costs to residential and commercial property owners. See the \"Costs and Benefits\" chapter for a detailed description of the resources used for each primary and secondary impact. While we followed NOAA's risk assessment methodology (versus their impact assessment method), the process was different for each city because each had different challenges associated with estimating future damages by storm type. Our adaptations are described in more detail in the \"Costs and Benefits\" chapter. Lastly, we estimated the costs for implementing each adaptation strategy within the action scenarios. Data were gathered from a variety of sources, such as construction companies and the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG). See the \"Costs and Benefits\" chapter for more detail."}, {"section_title": "Making a Decision", "text": "After all data are compiled, we aggregated to calculate the benefit-cost ratios. The chosen discount rate should also be incorporated into the analysis to calculate net present value (NPV) of benefits and costs. Because a dollar is worth more today than it will be in the future, future net benefits and costs are calculated in today's dollars. This conversion is called \"discounting,\" and NPV is the net value in today's dollars. As Carlsbad action scenarios did not start until 2050, we evaluated the planning horizon years 2050 to 2100. In Del Mar, the action scenarios began in 2030 and we evaluated the years 2030 to 2100. City planners and decision-makers can compare these ratios to determine the best option for their community. The first task was to assemble the total benefits of each action scenario. This step began with compiling the benefits, or potential damages prevented, from the baseline risk (no action scenario.) For both Carlsbad and Del Mar, we followed the process for the risk assessment option as it incorporated the probability of flooding occurrences into the calculations. From the baseline, annual expected damages were calculated for each action scenario by incorporating the annual probability of storm events, e.g., a 10-year storm. The NOAA framework provides the equations and step-by-step process for calculating and discounting expected annual losses. After determining the total benefits of each action scenario, the next step required compiling the adaptation strategy costs within each action scenario, and then discounting the cost to present value. For this step, the implementation timeline for each strategy must be determined, with the capital and maintenance costs specified by year (2030, 2040, etc.). Because the costs are incurred in different years, they must all be discounted back to present value to get the NPV. We followed the specified timelines given by each city. Finally, the last task was to assess each action scenario by calculating net benefits and benefit-cost ratios. City planners and decision-makers can use these measures to determine which action scenario has the highest return on investment. They should also consider other relevant information that cannot be quantified in monetary terms, such as whether the loss of their beaches would change the culture or identity of their community. We developed benefit-cost ratios for each city and conducted sensitivity analysis to determine the robustness of our results. These are described in the \"Sensitivity Analysis\" chapter."}, {"section_title": "Baseline Risks", "text": "In this chapter, we focus on the NOAA Framework's \"Understanding Your Baseline Risk\" component. This chapter describes our specific baseline risk methodology and adjustments we made to fit each city's approach. To make our process easier to replicate, we situated our methodology within the NOAA framework. The Carlsbad Assessment projected future flooding impacts by modeling the water level increases over time. The Del Mar Assessment, on the other hand, projected the increase in flooding occurrences over time by referencing past flooding events and flooding return probabilities. Both approaches provided the opportunity to apply NOAA's baseline risk component in these two distinct circumstances. Carlsbad's approach was more aligned with the NOAA's high water level event scenarios (NOAA Chapter 1, Task 2). Del Mar's approach did not necessitate incorporating high water level event scenarios. These differences and adaptations are described in this chapter. We also expand upon the NOAA framework by including chronic inundation and bluff erosion hazards in our analyses. The specific hazards determine which, and how, baseline risks are identified. The Carlsbad study area in Planning Zone 1 assessed impacts causes by coastal flooding, chronic inundation, and bluff erosion. The Del Mar study area in North Beach, on the other hand, only included coastal flooding and chronic inundation. Thus, each baseline risk scenario incorporates different sources of the impacts, with Del Mar excluding bluff erosion. Table 3, on the next page, shows the modifications by task and city. Most of these tasks were conducted as part of each city's vulnerability assessment. We acquired those assessments and relevant GIS layers to incorporate into this study. The Carlsbad Assessment identified two sea level rise scenarios using CoSMoS v3.0. Per their report, they selected 0.5 meters (1.64 ft.) and 2.0 meters (6.56 ft.), which roughly parallels the forecasted high sea level rise from the 2012 National Research Council's report for the 2050 and 2100 planning horizons (City of Carlsbad, 2016). To be consistent with the Carlsbad Assessment hazard modeling, we chose the high sea level rise scenario with the 2050 and 2100 planning horizons. The Del Mar Assessment differed in its approach by projecting the increase in flooding occurrences over time, instead of the water level increases like those used by Carlsbad. The Del Mar Assessment used flooding return probabilities and damages from past storm events to predict future impacts of coastal flooding. This required us to adapt NOAA's methodology, and as a result, there was no need to conduct Task 2 (Develop High-level Water Event Scenarios) in this section because future damages were not based on water depths. City vulnerability assessment selected high sea level rise scenario from CoSMoS v3.0. City selected 2050 and 2100 as their planning horizon years, which roughly corresponded with 0.5 meter and 2.0 meter sea level rise from the National Research Council projections (2012). They only provided forecasts for those two years. We predicted intermittent 5year points using the high USACE curve to fit a quadratic curvilinear regression, and benchmarked the sea level rise curve to the 2050 and 2100 values (0.5m and 2.0m)."}, {"section_title": "NOAA Methodology Adjustments", "text": "City vulnerability assessment selected a high sea level rise scenario. They did not project water-level increases. Rather, they used historical coastal flooding events to project the extent of future coastal flooding caused by storm events. Significant flooding equaled today's 10-year storm event. Extreme flooding was considered today's 100-year storm event. They projected future damages by increasing the probability of similar storm occurrences between now and 2100. Task 2: Develop high water level event scenarios None. We contacted NOAA directly to obtain exceedance probability curve data because the referenced website did not provide data in table format.

We also considered chronic inundation and bluff erosion. Conducted as part of the city vulnerability assessment. They provided us with GIS layers showing extent of coastal flooding. We also considered chronic inundation. While in some ways utilizing Carlsbad and Del Mar's existing modeling made the cost-benefit analyses simpler, it also yielded challenges when applying the NOAA framework. For example, the Carlsbad Assessment only provided two time points, and both Carlsbad and Del Mar Assessments only considered one sea level rise scenario (high). Thus, we were limited to only comparing action scenarios under the high sea level rise scenario and could not make comparisons under the low or intermediate scenarios. Similarly, since we only possessed modeled impacts for 100-year storm events in 2050 and 2100 in Carlsbad, we had to interpolate damage estimates between years and storm types. Furthermore, since the first time-point modeled was 2050, we did not have information regarding potential impacts before 2050; thus, our analysis in Carlsbad starts at 2050. In Del Mar, we were limited to projecting future damages based on historical events as their modeled layers did not account for future increased water depth. Additionally, we chose to use NOAA's risk assessment option for both cities to incorporate storm event probabilities.\nWe did not re-assess exposed infrastructure. It fell out of the scope of this project due to required additional modeling. Rather, we created a protection or effectiveness factor that ranged from 0 -100%. We assumed 100% protection for each action scenario, and varied this assumption in sensitivity analysis. We did not re-assess exposed infrastructure. It fell out of the scope of this project due to required additional modeling. Rather, we created a protection or effectiveness factor that ranged from 0 -100%.

As we did not conduct NOAA's Task 2 (Table 8), this chapter does not include \"Applying the Method\" or \"Assumptions\" sections. The next section describes the action scenarios and strategies selected by the cities.\nAdditionally, we only calculated damages for the no action scenario (baseline risk). We calculated any negative impacts of implementing the action scenarios, which were then applied in the final cost-benefit model discussed in the next chapter, \"Making a Decision: Results.\" We did not have positive impacts associated with each action scenario because we did not re-assess the exposed infrastructure; Task 2 in \"Assess What You Can Do Differently\" chapter. \u2022 Valued the negative impacts associated with each action scenario, but did not calculate separate damages for each action scenario. Because we were unable to re-assess damages of each action scenario, we applied these negative damages to the final cost-benefit model (found in next chapter). \u2022 Used the city's vulnerability assessment to determine which impacts applied to a 10-year storm event and 100-year storm event. \u2022 Only created one modified table (NOAA table 3.4.) for the no action scenario because each action scenario had the same baseline damages for a 10-year storm event and 100-year storm event. \u2022 Did not create NOAA table 3.6 because we incorporated increased frequency of current 10-year and 100-year event into NOAA table 4.2. \u2022 Valued the negative impacts associated with each action scenario, but did not calculate separate damages for each action scenario. Because we were unable to re-assess damages of each action scenario, we applied these negative damages to the final cost-benefit model (found in next chapter). We conducted Task 1 in this section in conjunction with Task 3 in \"Baseline Risk.\" That is, we identified each asset category's specific impacts while assessing the exposed areas. We assessed exposed infrastructure by overlaying the vulnerability assessment's hazard areas (flooding, chronic inundation, and bluff erosion) on the city's parcels and infrastructure using ESRI's ArcMap software. Carlsbad provided us the impacted parcel file with hazards already identified by parcel. This file was originally used in their vulnerability assessment. As previously mentioned, except for private residential and commercial/industrial property, and beaches, all of the other assets in our analysis were city-owned. We assessed primary impacts for the following asset categories, but as noted in Table 10 not all asset categories had impacts in the Carlsbad study area: \u2022 City property and structures \u2022 City public infrastructure \u2022 City transportation infrastructure \u2022 Residential property \u2022 Commercial and industrial property\nFor Carlsbad, we re-created NOAA's Table 4.2, which showed the annual estimated losses due to coastal flooding. We only calculated one table for the no action scenario, since it was the baseline that applied to all action scenarios as discussed in detail in the previous chapter. This table shows estimates of average damages due to the coastal flooding for each storm type (100-yr., 50-yr., 10-yr., 2-yr., and 1-yr.). We estimated averages differently than NOAA's formulas (Equations 4.2 and 4.3) because we only had modeled damages for a 100-year storm at 2050 (0.5 meter) and 2100 (2.0) meter. Instead, we used the high water event table (Table 6 in \"Baseline Risk\" chapter) to interpolate average damages values for intermediate 5-year periods and all storm types. To interpolate, we multiplied the ratio of the difference between the relevant year's and the 2050 base year's high water level (numerator) AND the difference between the 2100 and 2050 high-water level (denominator) to the difference between our known expected 2100 and 2050 average damages. Then, we followed NOAA Equation 4.4 to estimate the expected damages. That is, we multiplied the average damages by the storm type probability. For example, the averages damage in Carlsbad for a 100-yr storm in 2080 is $6.56 million; we multiplied this value by 0.01 to get expected damages of $0.7 million. Table 23 shows the results of our estimation. Finally, again following NOAA, we assumed a linear change between the 5-year periods and interpolated annual data. For Del Mar, we also calculated a table similar to NOAA Table 4.2 that estimated coastal flooding damages for today's extreme (100-year) and significant (10-year) storm events, and how those damages would increase over time due to the increased frequency of similar storms. In Table 24, we adapted NOAA's table by adding several columns to represent probability changes over time. Then, we multiplied those probabilities by average damages to get expected damages for each timeframe. We obtained those increased probabilities from the city's vulnerability assessment. Like Carlsbad, we only calculated one table for the no action scenario, since it was the baseline that applied to all action scenarios. Next, we calculated the expected annual coastal flooding losses between 2030 and 2100. Again, following NOAA's methodology, we assumed a linear change between the select years (2030, 2050, 2070, and 2100) and interpolated the annual data.  Significant (Current 10-yr.) 0.5 $9.9 $4.9 1 $9.9 $9.9 1 $9.9 $9.9 1 $9.9 $9.9 Expected Annual Loss $8.0 $19.1 $40.8 $71.6 For both cities, we then combined these annual loss estimates with the expected annual damages from chronic inundation and bluff erosion where applicable, and calculated the total annual benefits by action scenario. To do this, we followed NOAA's Equation 4.5 ( Figure 14). We started with the baseline no action scenario damage at year N. We also incorporated our protection factor and assumed that each adaptation action scenario would prevent 100 percent of the potential damages in the no action scenario, meaning each action scenario received 100 percent of the total benefit. (We varied this assumption in sensitivity analysis.) Then, we subtracted the negative impacts for each action scenario (action scenario damages at year N). The negative impacts for each city are shown below. Because we did not have any additional positive impacts, we did not add positive action scenario benefits at year N. We discounted each year's benefits to get the present value. We applied a one percent discount rate as used in similar studies (Nature Conservancy, 2016). Finally, we summed all the years to get the Net Present Value (NPV) of the total benefits for each action scenario (Table 25 and Table 26). Carlsbad Negative Impacts by Action Scenario: \u2022 Scenario 1: None \u2022 Scenario 2: Loss of beach tourism business revenue and city tax revenue for loss of beach starting in 2070 \u2022 Scenario 3: None Del Mar Negative Impacts by Action Scenario: \u2022 Scenario 1a: Loss of tax revenue for removed structures starting in 2100. \u2022 Scenario 1b: Loss of beach tourism business revenue and city tax revenue for loss of beach starting in 2070; loss of tax revenue for removed structures starting in 2100. \u2022 Scenario 2: Loss of tax revenue for removed structures starting in 2040."}, {"section_title": "Carlsbad", "text": "At the direction of city staff, the study area was limited to the coastal area of Carlsbad's Planning Zone 1, delineated by Buena Vista Lagoon to the north, and Tamarack Avenue to the south. The lagoon itself was not included in the study area.\nThe Carlsbad Assessment did not reveal long-term losses to tax revenue-generating properties. Therefore, we only estimated the fiscal impacts of temporary losses to services resulting from increased coastal flooding and chronic inundation of the beach in the study area. Specifically, the analysis focused on the loss of sales and use tax (from the purchase of goods) and TOT revenue from hotel/motel expenditures in the selected study area, Planning Zone 1. Our analysis specifically addresses revenue impact to the city's General Fund resulting from: \u2022 Potential interruptions of business operations caused by short-to medium-term coastal flooding \u2022 Loss of city tax revenue associated with loss of beach\nIntermittent storm events may temporarily interrupt business operations.\nCarlsbad receives sales tax revenues from purchases made by visitors to the local retail establishments. According to the State Board of Equalization (2016a), the city receives sales tax revenues equal to 0.95 percent of the local taxable expenditures that occur within city limits. Although the Bradley-Burns Local Sales and Use Tax (California State Board of Equalization, 2016b) specifies that one percent of the total sales tax is distributed to the local jurisdiction, cities within many California counties, including San Diego County, share five percent of sales tax revenues with the county government to cover administrative and other costs, retaining 95 percent of the one percent sales tax, or 0.95 percent of total taxable sales, for themselves.

These two values roughly corresponded with the 2050 and 2100 planning horizon years from the National Research Council's (NRC) high range (City of Carlsbad, 2016). The Carlsbad Assessment only provided sea level projections for 2050 and 2100. Consequently, we had to generate local high water level event scenarios for the 5-year intermittent periods. We first used the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Sea Level Change Curve Calculator to obtain the high sea level projections for the years in-between 2050 and 2100. As the Carlsbad Assessment provided values for 2050 and 2100 and their modeled impacts, we used these two dates as anchor points and refit the sea level rise curve from the nearest NOAA tide gauge (La Jolla, CA) using curvilinear regression with a quadratic equation. The NOAA framework recommended utilizing a quadratic equation because sea level rise is likely to increase at higher rates in the future. Additionally, the USACE curves were nonlinear and we aimed to match their growth. We predicted values for each 5-year increment between 2050 and 2100, incorporated the predicted rate of change in sea level rise, and matched the Carlsbad Assessment's two modeled years (Table 4). Our second task was to estimate high water level event increases for the 5-year increments by storm types. Again, we chose NOAA's risk assessment and utilized Option B because we wanted to consider the probability of storm events occurring in our analysis. As the Carlsbad Assessment modeled the impacted areas for a 100-year storm in 2050 and 2100, it was not necessary to calculate high water level values to estimate damages. However, we completed this task because the high water level event estimates allowed us to interpolate the damages for other years and other storm types, when calculating the average and expected monetized damages prevented by year (NOAA Chapter 4 Task 1, Table 4.2), described later in this report. Thus, we calculated the high water level events here so we could apply NOAA's methodology later. 4 The NOAA framework provided direction to use the NOAA Extreme Water Levels map \"Exceedance Probability Curves\" for the closest station; in our case, La Jolla CA. Unfortunately, the charts referenced by NOAA did not provide enough detail to identify each storm type's mean higher high water (MHHW) value. Instead, we contacted NOAA directly and obtained the data behind the charts. The data for numerous storm types provided by NOAA is shown in Table 5. Then, we followed NOAA's methodology to create a table similar to Table 1.6 in the NOAA framework for the high sea level rise scenario. For each storm type, we added the exceedance probability MHHW (Table 5) to the projected mean sea level rise (Table 4). Our table estimates high water level values for 100-year, 50-year, 10-year, 2-year, and 1year storm events (Table 6).  The Carlsbad Assessment included a list of parcels impacted by coastal flooding (100-year storm), chronic inundation, and bluff erosion in 2050 and 2100, and GIS layers for each of those hazards, provided by their consultant. Because of this, we did not need to perform this analysis. We further identified specific impacts, which are discussed in more detail in the \"Cost and Benefits\" chapter. The following city-owned and non-city asset categories were considered in our analysis: \u2022 City property and structures \u2022 City public infrastructure \u2022 City transportation infrastructure \u2022 Residential property \u2022 Commercial and industrial property \u2022 Beaches"}, {"section_title": "Task 2: Develop High Water Level Event Scenarios", "text": "We did not conduct this task, as future damages in the Del Mar Assessment were based on increased frequency of storms instead of increased depth of water caused by sea level rise; the Del Mar Assessment did not provide projections of future mean sea level rise. Unlike the Carlsbad Assessment where we used NOAA's exceedance probability curves to develop high water level increases, for the Del Mar Assessment, we only had the modeled damages for today's significant and extreme events, and the predicted change in their occurrences between the present and 2100. Although we were unable to estimate the water level increases for North Beach, we were able to adapt the NOAA methodology to project how damages would increase over time by increasing the frequency of storm events. In the \"Make a Decision: Results\" chapter, we applied the flooding probabilities and timeline shown in Table 7 to estimate how damages would change in the future. The increase in storm occurrences assumes the same extent and reach as the present storms, per the Del Mar Assessment. This approach allowed us to calculate the baseline no action scenario, i.e., damages prevented, without having modeled damages by sea level rise depths, i.e., 2 feet."}, {"section_title": "Task 3: Assess Exposed Infrastructure for a No-Action Scenario", "text": "This task was conducted as part of the Del Mar Assessment.

Where relevant for multi-story condominium buildings, we identified ground floor units because we assumed flooding would not damage second floor units, or higher. This required us to view the buildings on Google Earth, Google maps, street view, or, in a few cases, conduct a physical site visit, to determine the unit number ordering scheme and layout, i.e., equal or unequal number of units on each floor. Where we could not ascertain specific first floor units, we assumed the lowest numbered units were located on the ground floor. Additionally, we also visually inspected whether the hazard layer, such as flooding, \"touched\" the structure.

For this report, we only analyzed beach nourishment to be consistent with other regional nourishment projects ). 2.

Scenario 2 uses the same two-prong approach of Scenario 1, but opts to raise and improve seawalls, rather than construct groins. In this scenario, beaches will become vulnerable to erosion and shorelines will migrate inland after nourishment is discontinued ( Figure 9). Scenario 3 relies solely on the natural protection measure of beach nourishment through 2100, with no change to surf conditions (beyond intermittent interruptions during scheduled nourishments) ( Figure  10).

Scenario 1b implements the same plan schedule as Scenario 1a, but foregoes new engineered projects in favor of raising or improving existing sand retention structures (seawalls, revetments). The trade-off in this scenario is the likely loss of beach area over time ( Figure 12). Scenario 2 forgoes all engineered projects and accommodations and only considers two strategies: natural protection through beach nourishment until water depths exceed 15 percent risk, with retreat measures initiated at 5 percent risk, and continued as risk increases to 100 percent.

This chapter describes our specific methodology for valuing impacts and adaptation strategies, and any adjustments we made to fit each city's approach into NOAA's framework. We provide specific assumptions in detail to help others apply NOAA's framework. Importantly, we developed values for three inputs into our final model, described in the next chapter. These three inputs were: 1. Monetized baseline risk primary and secondary impacts, which represent the maximum damages prevented, or the no action scenario 2. Monetized negative impacts resulting from action scenarios (We did not have any additional positive impacts.) 3.

Depending upon the action scenario, we then account for any additional negative impacts that would reduce the benefits (damages prevented) of the baseline model. The baseline risks depend upon the hazards included in the analysis. For Carlsbad, we included impacts from coastal flooding, chronic inundation, and bluff erosion. Only coastal flooding and chronic inundation were included in Del Mar. Table 9 summarizes the adjustments we made to NOAA's methodology.

Our next task was to monetize the impacts (i.e., assign monetary values). Using the identified impacts for both 2050 (0.5 meters) and 2100 (2.0 meters), we compiled data that allowed us to estimate the value of the various assets. We then compiled the no action scenario (baseline) tables for 2050 and 2100 following the risk assessment option. As stated in Table 9, we only created one table for the no action scenario because these baseline damages were the same for each action scenario. Thus, it would be redundant to create tables for each one. We also modified NOAA's Table 3.4 to fit the assessment years of 2050 and 2100, and included chronic inundation and bluff erosion hazards (Table 11). Because our baseline damages for coastal flooding were estimated from a 100-year storm event, we did not include other storm event types in this table. However, we do incorporate them when we estimate expected damages from annual storm probabilities (in the next chapter.) Finally, we did not create NOAA's Table 3.6, which shows the combined monetized damages by storm type. Again, because we only had projected damages for a 100-year storm, we waited until the next chapter to incorporate storm probabilities that required interpolation of monetary damages from a 100year storm at 2050 and 2100. Rather, we decided to only include the damages estimated from the vulnerability assessment in this chapter's tables. We conduct all of the interpolation in the next chapter. Furthermore, NOAA's Table 3.6 damages are the same damages shown in their average damages column in Table 4.2, which is used to compute the annual expected damages by storm type. Table 4.2  extends Table 3.6 and we found it redundant to create both.  \nPer the next step in this task, we considered additional positive or negative impacts that could result from the action scenarios. We relied upon on Del Mar's Adaptation Plan and their description of action scenarios because we did not re-assess exposed infrastructure, as noted in the previous chapter. There were no perceived additional positive impacts for each action scenario. However, the following negative impacts were identified: \u2022 Scenario 1a: Loss of tax revenue for removed structures starting in 2100. \u2022 Scenario 1b: Loss of beach tourism business revenue and city tax revenue for loss of beach starting in 2070; loss of tax revenue for removed structures starting in 2100. \u2022 Scenario 2: Loss of tax revenue for removed structures starting in 2040. Our next task was to monetize the impacts, i.e., assign dollar values. Using the specific identified impacts for both the significant and extreme events, we compiled data that allowed us to estimate the value of the various assets. Then, we compiled the no action scenario (baseline) tables for both the significant and extreme coastal flooding event, following the risk assessment option. As previously shown in Table 9, we only created one table for the no action scenario because these baseline damages were the same for each action scenario. We also adapted NOAA's Table 3.4 to show damages for the significant and extreme event instead of planning horizon years, and added another table to show expected chronic inundation damages from 2030 to 2100 (Table 16 and Table 17).

In the case of a temporary flooding, the homeowner would incur partial damage and/or cleanup costs to the structure, while in the case of chronic inundation; the homeowner would likely lose the entire structure and use of the property. Importantly, we assumed current conditions for all of our estimates. That is, we estimated future property values and future beach attendance on today's figures. While we could potentially project population changes, other factors, such as future housing market prices would be difficult to accurately predict.

When that land no longer exists (a collapsed bluff), or is no longer accessible (area is inundated with water), it is assumed the lost structure cannot be rebuilt. The resulting financial consequence is the total loss of investment to the homeowner and the loss of property tax revenue to the city. Neither study area in Carlsbad or Del Mar was impacted by residential bluff erosion. However, there were residential properties impacted by chronic inundation in Carlsbad, (but not Del Mar). The economic value of these residential properties was defined by their estimated real estate market value and Carlsbad property tax assessments. For estimated market values of single-family homes and multi-family units, we collected data from two real estate websites: zillow.com and redfin.com. Zillow estimates (\"Zestimates\u00ae\") are calculated from public and user-submitted data, entered into Zillow's proprietary formula. Redfin calculates their estimates using comparable home listings and sales records culled from the \"MLS,\" the multiple listing service used by real estate agents. We gathered the residential property values in late 2016 and early 2017, with the acknowledgement that real estate markets fluctuate with corresponding sales data. For any residential property (single-family, multi-family, or vacant lot) where a market value was not available, we identified a comparable property's estimate, calculated the price per square foot, and applied that rate to arrive at an estimate for the missing data. For condominiums, individual units' market values were collected, but the value of associational common elements such as outer walls, lobbies, clubhouses, pool houses, gyms, etc., was not calculated. There were no large scale, multi-unit rental apartments (5 or more units) in bluff hazard and inundation zones for Carlsbad, and those in Del Mar were only considered for flooding. Similar to previous studies, we applied business rules to determine when the property was no longer inhabitable (Table 20). We visually checked ESRI imagery and Google Earth to conclude whether the hazard touched the structure or not. The business rules also accounted for the multiple hazard types, occurring at different times. For instance, if a parcel was predicted to be lost to chronic inundation in 2050, we did not also assume temporary flooding damages in 2050 or 2100.

For the Carlsbad Boulevard replacement costs, we gathered the generic cost per linear foot of constructing a similar road from their 2016-17 Capital Improvement Program budget.

These data were also used to calculate lost city tax revenue due to the shoreline eroding. Ecological value of beach land was not calculated. CoSMoS v3.0 provided projections of shoreline loss that were incorporated into each city's vulnerability assessment. For the City of Carlsbad, we were provided with GIS layers showing the projected change in shoreline for 2050 and 2100. 7 The Del Mar Assessment provided a table with projected width change over time (Table 21). We used these values to estimate Del Mar's beach loss for the high sea level rise scenario. For both cities, we assumed an annual linear loss of beach for missing years, which followed Del Mar's pattern for the existing years until it reached zero (2010 to 2060). We applied linear interpolation between the specified years (2010, 2020, 2030, etc.), with 2015 serving as the base at the 2010 value. We calculated the loss of beach tourism revenue using an area-based model (Engel et al., 2015, p. A-41). The area-based model calculated an attendance density factor based on current attendance and beach area. This factor was multiplied by annual projected beach loss to estimate the loss of beach visitors each year. Then, the annual loss of visitors was multiplied by a day use value to project loss of beach revenue. We assumed the day use value did not change as the beach narrowed. In actuality, the day use value may decrease as the beach width narrows because visitors prefer wider beaches (Engel et al., 2015), but we did not employ an amenity-based model that changes the day use value as the function of beach width. While an amenity-based model was considered, such as the USACE's Coastal Sediment Benefits Analysis Tool (CSBAT) model, we decided to pursue a more parsimonious approach. Our primary rationale for this decision was that we did not have the inputs needed for the CSBAT model. We did not believe approximating inputs would gain us any benefit over the simpler area-based model. We also did not have any data to adjust the day use value per changes in beach width. To account for this, we varied the day use values in sensitivity analysis to check the robustness of our results.  (King, 2005). As we did not conduct our own beach surveys, we deemed this value most relevant. The 2005 value was inflated to 2015 values using the CPI. The current areas of both cities' beaches were calculated using GIS and Google Earth. 8 From this, we calculated an attendance density factor that was applied to the estimated loss of beach associated with erosion or chronic inundation. Since a guiding assumption throughout this study was to assume current conditions, we applied the 2015 attendance as our base for all years. While we concede that the San Diego region's population is forecasted to grow (SANDAG, 2013), we preferred to remain consistent in our guiding assumption. However, as noted earlier, baseline assumptions were applied equally to each action scenario; thus, any underestimation resulting from this assumption would not result in any change to baseline comparisons. Beach attendance could potentially affect the negative impact values of Carlsbad's Scenario 2 and Del Mar's Scenario 1b. Because of this, and that other studies have noted that attendance counts are frequently overestimated (King & McGregor, 2012;Engel et al., 2015), we tested the sensitivity of our cost-benefit model results to Scenario 2's and Scenario 1b's negative impacts values."}, {"section_title": "Loss of beach tourism city tax revenue due to chronic inundation", "text": "Included in fiscal analysis description."}, {"section_title": "City road cleanup for flooding events", "text": "No flooding was projected to impact roads in the Carlsbad study area.

Generally, the most common type of material used for terminal groin structures is rock. Rock (or rubble mound) groins usually have a core of smaller, graded stone with an armor layer of larger stones overlying the core. We assumed a rock groin would be selected as the preferred choice for this adaptation strategy. We assumed similar structure type as described in the SANDAG Regional Beach Sand Retention Strategy (2001) and therefore equivalent costs per linear foot scaled for two 400-foot groins. The cost per linear foot includes additional fees for contingency, design and engineering, and project management. In addition to installation, the groins will require beach sand pre-fill. To account for this volume, we assumed the required beach sand pre-fill for each groin is the same volume per linear foot of the groin length as defined by .\nGroins are linear hard structures that extend perpendicular from a beach into the open ocean, and form simple, physical barriers that interrupt littoral drift (naturally occurring longshore sediment movement.) As sediment accumulates on a groin's updrift side, the accretion increases the size of the beach there. However, the downdrift side of the groin can experience a loss of sediment due to this littoral interruption, especially if the groin is too high, too long, or lacks permeability. Typically made of boulders, groins can also be constructed with manufactured sheet piles, concrete rubble, or large timbers. New groin construction should look at offshore geography, tide data, and local wave energy to determine the appropriate height, width, length, and void size to achieve the desired results. Permeability should be balanced between too little (unacceptable loss of beach on the downdrift side), and too much (not enough accretion on the updrift side to be effective.)

The day use value is part of the area-based model that estimates the loss of beach tourism using an assumed amount of spending per day, per beach visitor. As mentioned previously, we assumed the same day use value of $54.24, adjusted to 2015 dollars, from a local Carlsbad study (King, 2005). Another recent study recommended a day use value of $39.49 ($40) to be used in southern California studies (Engel et al., 2015).

While a lower day use value results in a smaller difference between Scenario 2's ratio and the other two action scenarios in Carlsbad, the ranking does not change for either city.

That is, what if the sea walls did not ultimately result in the beaches being lost. While it is unlikely that there would be no loss, we sought to test the sensitivity of our results to the overall assumption of beach negative impacts.

Our results were not robust to the assumption of equal effectiveness of all action scenarios. For Carlsbad, if Scenario 3 is, in actuality, more effective at preventing damages than Scenario 1, it could be the more cost-effective strategy. In Del Mar, Scenario 1b could be the more cost-effective strategy if it is more effective than Scenario 1a. Finally, because action scenarios could incur costs on different timeframes, various discount rates could alter study results. When cities undertake similar analyses with adaption strategy implementation of distinct timelines that extend in the far future, they should carefully consider which discount rate to apply or conduct similar sensitivity analysis before making a decision. Ultimately, each city needs to consider benefit-cost ratios for each of their action scenarios, and their own city's needs. In our examples, each city had two viable action scenarios. Carlsbad could choose Scenario 3 over Scenario 1 if there were concerns that a groin could impact their surfing community. Both options will have a strong return on investment. Del Mar could select to engineer groins, as in Scenario 1a, over raising or improving their seawalls, as in Scenario 1b, even though the results were not robust to effectiveness assumptions.

In this way, seawalls are like icebergs; they are much taller than what is visible. Freestanding seawalls located on back beaches also act as boundaries between public recreation areas and private property, sidewalks, parking lots, etc. Seawalls that buttress coastal bluffs have the dual purpose of protecting against wave action, and supporting the bluff itself. Because bluff seawalls are designed to brace near-vertical slopes, they are taller than freestanding seawalls and require the addition of embedded horizontal tiebacks with anchors. Raising the height of an existing freestanding seawall can be accomplished by drilling holes into the wall cap, inserting rebar extensions at specific intervals, and setting them in place with construction epoxy. New concrete is then poured into a form built around the rebar extensions, and leveled to the desired height. An engineering analysis would be needed to determine the maximum height a wall can be raised and still maintain its structural integrity. Bluff seawalls rarely need to be made taller, but they are vulnerable to lower damage from \"scouring\"accelerated erosion caused by waves plunging downward at the toe (base) of the wall.

An extended foundation, or new pilings (stilts) are constructed to the desired height. Once the now-elevated foundation is complete, the temporary supports are removed, and the structure is re-attached. The lowest level of the structure is now above flood levels. The viability of elevating a structure is contingent on the size of the building, type of construction, number of floors, condition of the foundation, permits, over-size vehicle access, scheduling and other construction variables. Site preparations include permitting, engineering, accessibility considerations, disconnection from all utilities, and removing exterior steps, porches, decks, shrubbery, fencing, etc. If raising the entire building is not economically or structurally feasible, a new floor can be built on top of the highest existing floor (after removing the roof), and the flood-prone, lowest floor is abandoned and modified into a floodproof system.

Communities can use it to assess the impact of inundation on their entire infrastructure, which is referred to as the holistic approach. Alternatively, if a community wants to focus on select infrastructure, such as a hospital or wastewater treatment plant, the framework allows for this priority infrastructure approach. What A significant impetus for developing this framework was the growing demand from communities for guidance to help protect publicly-owned infrastructure, such as roads, schools, and sewer systems. However, the holistic approach includes assessing costs and benefits to homes and businesses as well as public assets, and the adaptation strategies discussed in Chapter 2 and Appendix A can be used to protect both private property and public infrastructure. In fact, some of the adaptation strategies are traditionally employed to protect private, but can be viable options to protect public property as well. You can choose to use this framework to perform a more focused analysis of public infrastructure, or to take a broader look at your entire community. The framework can also help communities perform either an impact assessment or a risk assessment. An impact assessment involves assessing the impacts of just a few different water-level increase heights to develop a sense of the amount of damage to expect in certain scenarios compared to the financial cost of adaptation strategies. A risk assessment is a more resource-intensive analysis that multiplies the probability of each water-level increase by the value of the impact to generate an apples-to-apples comparison of the expected costs and the expected benefits of implementing adaptation strategies against coastal flooding.

Finally, we encourage communities to assemble a team to effectively use this framework, as several of its steps require specialized expertise or training. Identifying qualified experts and engaging stakeholders is an important part of the process. Your team should include economists, planners, GIS experts, land use attorneys, civil engineers, and inundation modeling experts if available; it can also include utility supervisors and emergency managers. If you do not have the needed expertise in-house for all the tasks, seek support from outside resources such as local universities, nonprofit organizations, or consultants.

In 2007, New York City began working to prepare for the impacts of climate change as part of PlaNYC-a comprehensive planning effort to address every aspect of the city's physical infrastructure. The effort recognized that adapting to SLR must be a key part of city policy. Accordingly, New York took action to address the most pressing risks; areas of the city were rebuilt, rezoned, and refashioned to better weather those threats. When Hurricane Sandy hit the city in October 2012, many of these changes helped prevent property damage. Governors Island experienced peak flooding of almost 13 feet above sea level and saw 5 feet of water come over the southern seawall, but a 30-acre park there came through the storm nearly untouched because its design accounted for hazards like Sandy.

Options B and C in Step 3 of this chapter outline a simplified and more advanced methodology for using these curves to generate local SLR projections.  Step 2: Choose a few years along the planning horizon to evaluate local SLR. One approach would be every 30 years (2040, 2070, 2100), but there is no ideal planning horizon; timeframes of interest will be specific to your community, although you may want to consider performing this step out to 2100 to observe the effects of SLR over time. This will not limit you to a particular planning horizon in performing the cost-benefit analysis. Step 3: Calculate local SLR increases for the years you chose, compared to the first year of your analysis. This involves incorporating local projection information into the global SLR curves, and using quadratic equations to determine the amount of rise for different years along the curves. Incorporating local information is necessary because different areas of the country have varying amounts of subsidence or uplift, and there are also differences due to ocean basin trends. \nStep 1: Using the NOAA Extreme Water Levels map, find the \"Exceedence Probability Curves\" for the available city closest to your community. Use the bolded curve on the graph to determine the water-level increase relative to the mean higher high water (MHHW) level for any storm intensity from the 1-year storm to the 200-year storm. Consider selecting at least the 1-year, 2-year, 10-year, 30-year, 100-year, and 200-year storm in developing this initial table. (Note that \"10-year storm\" refers to a storm that is projected to occur once every 10 years. That is, such a storm has a 10 percent chance of occurring in any given year-it could happen more than once.) See the first two columns of Table 1.6, which show the storm-type and present water-level increases, for a sample of how this table might look. This table presents two SLR scenarios; however, your community may choose to examine more or fewer scenarios in your analysis.\nStep 1: Use water-level increases developed in the previous task and the NOAA Sea Level Rise and Coastal Flooding Impacts Viewer (where available) to make a reconnaissance-level assessment of the exposed land and infrastructure in your local community. Note that this step is not necessary to the analysis; when available, though, it can provide a useful visual of flooding in your community for 1-to 6-foot water-level increases. Step 2: Determine whether you are interested in assessing the impacts to specific elements of your infrastructure such as a wastewater treatment plant, utility, or hospital (the priority infrastructure approach), or assessing the impacts to your Key considerations for this task: \u2022 Are you interested in assessing the impacts to all infrastructure in your community (holistic approach), or will you be choosing one or two priority infrastructure elements to assess (priority infrastructure approach)? \u2022 What is the complexity of your flooding map, and what are its limitations? Some are simplifications that just consider elevation and would show an area flooding even with a mountain shielding it from storm surge. Others account for this by evaluating how the connectivity of adjacent land parcels affect the flood waters (e.g., hills that prevent the tide from coming further inland. Does your modeling account for wave action? \u2022 What is the resolution digital elevation map data? This will impact the uncertainty of your flood modeling.\nStep 1: Review \u2022 Do your adaptation strategies directly respond to your risks? \u2022 Do your action scenarios range in cost and effectiveness? A wide range of scenarios can establish the foundation for constructive discussions. \u2022 What is the period of effectiveness of your adaptation strategies? Many solutions are only temporary and need to be combined with plans for managed retreat in the future. \u2022 Can a combination of smaller adaptation strategies produce results at least as good as a more expensive adaptation strategy goal? Experts required for this task: \u2022 Land use attorney and planners to help select adaptation strategies in Steps 1 and 2. or implemented, like moving expensive equipment to higher ground in a hospital or other priority infrastructure. While Table 2.1 and Appendix A provide some general, introductory information, there are other factors to consider as you select adaptation strategies that include: \u2022 The costs of strategies can vary significantly depending on the unique characteristics of your community. \u2022 Non-economic factors such as legal challenges or public outreach needs can increase the resources needed to implement a strategy. \u2022 The lifespan and effectiveness of any project will depend on the severity of future events. Keep in mind that some of these adaptation strategies may be more geared to an entire community and others are more applicable to protecting priority infrastructure. Step 2: Based on your list of possible adaptation strategies, develop one or more action scenarios. Each action scenario should consist of at least one adaptation strategy; you may want to combine strategies to enhance the effectiveness of the action scenario.  \nStep 1: Identify how each action scenario changes the coastal flooding impacts for each water-level increase identified in Chapter 1. Determine the impact of each action scenario. For example, does it move your infrastructure out of harm's way to completely prevent flood damage, reduce the frequency of inundation, prevent flooding up to certain water-levels, make the building more resilient against flooding, or combine some of these possibilities? See Table 2.1 and Appendix A for more information about how each flooding adaptation strategy reduces the impact of coastal flooding. Step 2: Re-assess the exposure of your infrastructure for each action scenario. This step's complexity will depend on how your action scenario changes the level or impacts of flooding.\nStep 1: Create a list of primary, secondary, and environmental impacts from flooding using Table 3.1 for input. Keep in mind that impacts will depend on the severity of flooding for certain action scenarios, and some impacts might not exist at all under certain action scenarios or water-level increases. However, for the purpose of this task, develop a single comprehensive list of all impacts that your community might face Key considerations for this task: \u2022 Are there additional impacts not included in the \"Comprehensive Listing of Impacts\" tables below that are specific to your community? \u2022 Do you have internal team members with basic economic understanding to generate a list of impacts or will you need an economist to review your list? Experts required for this task: \u2022 Experienced economists to help you identify impacts in Steps 1-3. under any flooding scenario. If you are only assessing the impacts on priority infrastructure, create a similar list identifying the direct impacts to your infrastructure and resulting secondary impacts. You may want to provide a higher level of detail about the impacts such an inventory of specific content in the infrastructure damaged or components of the infrastructure that would be affected. Step 2: List potential impacts of implementation, both positive and negative, for each adaptation strategy identified in your action scenario. See Table 3.2 for input. Make a separate list of impacts for each action scenario identified in Chapter 2. This step will be similar for both the priority infrastructure and holistic approach. Step 3: Brainstorm whether your community needs to consider any other impacts, not listed in Tables 3.1 or 3.2. Add these to the two lists you developed. This step will be similar for both the priority infrastructure and holistic approach.   Task 2: Monetize Impacts Objective: Select tools and approaches to monetize costs and benefits of the impacts identified in Task 1 of this chapter based on available resources.\nStep 1: Determine which tools and approaches you will use to monetize your list of impacts. Review Tables 3.1 and 3.2 from the previous task to see the type of impacts each tool or approach can monetize. Review Appendix B, which includes more detailed information about all of the tools and approaches, to learn more about the approach, including a description, general process for performing it, level of effort needed, expertise needed, and important resources. Keep in mind that Appendix B does not list all possible monetization approaches-consult your economic expert for more suggestions. As for many of the comprehensive tools and monetization approaches, you can monetize many primary impacts by answering three questions. \u2022 How high is the water for each flooding scenario? \u2022 How badly will the water damage your priority assets? \u2022 How much is the asset worth? While comprehensive tools often rely on more generic data, they can be quite useful when performing the holistic approach and Key considerations for this task: \u2022 Will you be able to monetize the most significant impacts? These typically include damage to priority infrastructure, buildings, and building contents, and sometimes business or utility interruption. \u2022 Does it make sense for your community to use a comprehensive monetization tool -such as COAST or FEMA Hazus-MH Flooding-when performing this task? These are resource intensive but are sometimes your best option when performing the holistic approach. \u2022 Can you monetize the impacts on your priority infrastructure without using comprehensive tools? Priority infrastructure can be unique, and you will generate more accurate damage estimates by leveraging site-specific data than relying on comprehensive monetization tools that may rely on more generic data. \u2022 Is it possible to quantify any of the impacts that you cannot monetize? Doing so will provide more insight than just considering qualitatively.\nStep 1: Assess the monetized cost-benefit results of each action scenario.

At this point, you may want to modify the years if you choose to change the timeframe of your analysis. You will need a separate set of tables for each SLR scenario you selected. Table 3.4 shows how one table might look for a sample no-action scenario (though at this step you would not yet have included monetized cost data, which is added in the next steps). Keep in mind that many impacts may only be applicable at higher levels of inundation or in a no-action scenario. For example, an action scenario that implements engineered barriers may eliminate impacts at certain water-level increases. If you are following the priority infrastructure approach, you can provide more detailed site-specific information than is shown in Table 3.3.

Also consider the implications of non-monetized co-benefits described in Task 1 of this Chapter. These non-monetized benefits can tip the balance in favor of scenarios with a lower monetized benefit-to-cost ratio, indicating that they may warrant a higher ranking than would be indicated by monetized values alone.

But community decisions are not based solely on economics. Other factors will need to be considered prior to implementing an action scenario-including social feasibility, community culture, and administrative and legal aspects. While economics are a very important criterion to consider, the unique conditions, history, and desired vision of each community will influence decisions about how to plan for and adapt to inundation threats from sea level rise and storms. As mentioned at the beginning of this guide, we recommend community leaders engage area stakeholders and residents in the decision process to develop a complete picture of community interests. Applying this framework can produce economic information that will be an important part of a community discussion. \u2022 Costs can vary significantly depending on the unique characteristics of your community and the exact nature of a project or policy, \u2022 Non-economic factors such as legal challenges or public outreach needs can increase the resources needed to implement a strategy, \u2022 The lifespan and effectiveness of any project will depend on the severity of future events.

Communities should seek out additional sources of information to learn more about the strategies contained in this appendix and to identify additional strategies. The resources listed in the \"Key References\" text box in Chapter 2 of this framework as well as those that follow are a few potential sources of additional information: \u2022 The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has a variety of publications related to flood hazard mitigation measures, including guidance documents as well as case studies. FEMA recently released Mitigation Ideas: A Resource for Reducing Risk to Natural Hazards, which includes actions to mitigation risks from storm surge, flood, and sea level rise. "}, {"section_title": "Fact Sheet A-1: Transfer of Development Rights", "text": "A transfer of development rights (TDR) ordinance provides a way for property owners to transfer development rights from one area to another. In the context of coastal flooding, this can be used as a measure to move future development from vulnerable areas to those that are completely out of harm's way. Additionally, TDR programs can be used to preserve open space, thereby facilitating the implementation of other mitigation measures, such as wetlands development or other green infrastructure to further increase a community's resilience to coastal flooding. TDRs are usually administered through a local government zoning ordinance, with specific districts zoned as either sending or receiving parcels. It is the local government's responsibility to determine the specific number and type of development rights (usually in terms of dwelling units or floor area per acre) that will be transferred. Once the transaction is complete, development rights are legally separated from the first \"sending\" parcel of land and attached to the second \"receiving\" parcel for use by the owner for development. 1"}, {"section_title": "Cost", "text": "TDR is a low-cost option for local governments because they are typically only responsible for the costs of developing and implementing the program through its planning and zoning functions, while the owners and sellers typically pay the costs for the development rights. Sometimes, local governments include transaction fees with the cost of the development rights when they are sold to help offset the costs of administering the program.\nPDR is a mid-price option with a higher cost than TDR but lower cost than a fee-simple acquisition-or outright buyout of the land. Costs for local government include those for developing and implementing the program as well as for purchasing the development rights. Purchase price for the development rights is estimated based on the most valuable use for the land allowed by zoning. For example, if the land is currently used for farming but could be developed for commercial uses based on current zoning laws, then the purchase price is generally based on the commercial value of the land. 2\nRolling easements are typically cheaper than protecting the land. In less developed areas, land owners are more likely to donate easements or sell them for a low price. Rolling easements for more densely developed areas have a higher cost because the land is more valuable and structures will have to be moved or abandoned as the shoreline moves in.\nFee-simple acquisition is a high-cost option. The costs include purchasing the property and structures at fair value from a private owner. These costs are generally paid by local governments and financed by bonds (which can be difficult to implement) or federal or state grants (e.g., FEMA's Hazard Mitigation Grant Program.) Grants are sometimes available to help counties acquire important coastal lands. Feesimple acquisition could also reduce property tax generation that had been collected from the purchased structures and/or land.\nCost varies depending on the infrastructure being relocated and can include the cost for new construction, moving lines, or physical relocation, as well as the cost of the land to which the infrastructure is being moved. Large and expensive infrastructure, such as power plants, sewer systems, and water treatment plants, can be very expensive to relocate, while roads and simple buildings are more financially feasible. Regionalization offers a lower cost alternative by having large infrastructure from a neighboring community replace the at-risk infrastructure in your community. With this approach, existing equipment is moved into the new facility, potentially increasing the capacity of the neighboring infrastructure. This could be a more cost-effective strategy for a wastewater treatment plant compared to relocating it because the land and supporting infrastructure (e.g., feeder lines) are already in place.\nSurge barriers tend to have high capital and maintenance costs, although the cost can vary significantly depending on local conditions. In general, movable barriers are more expensive than fixed barriers. Due to the cost, only a handful of movable barriers exist, including the Thames Barrier in London, the Maeslantkering Barrier in Rotterdam, the St. Petersburg Flood Protection Barrier, and the MOSE project in Venice. The costs of these projects varied from $100 million to several billion dollars. Generally, surge barrier construction costs range between $0.7 and $3.5 million per meter, and annual maintenance costs can be about 5 to 10 percent of the capital cost. 6 By preventing the inflow of water to an estuary, closure dams can significantly impact the environment by altering water salinity, temperature, suspended matter, and nutrients, all of which have the potential to affect the local ecosystem. Closure dams also may interfere with the use of the waterways for transportation. Using movable barriers mitigates both these impacts.\nBeach nourishment is a fairly expensive mitigation measure, generally costing between $300 and $1,000 per linear foot, including material, transportation, and construction costs. 8 In addition, the maintenance costs of beach nourishment are substantial, as it must be repeated every few years. Negative environmental impacts are a concern, primarily ecosystem impacts from dredging and burying organisms with the new sand in the area where the nourishment occurs.\nWhen land acquisition costs are low, levees are often the cheapest form of hard defense relative to how much protection they can offer. In general, construction can cost between $100 11 and $1,500 per linear foot depending on the height and slope 12 Maintenance costs are also an ongoing requirement to ensure the structure continues to provide appropriate levels of protection.\nSandbagging is generally one of the cheapest methods for flood protection since the bags cost about 25 cents each and are typically filled by volunteers. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers estimates that constructing a 100-ft long, 3-ft high sandbag barrier would cost about $3,100. 13 Depending on the situation, additional costs may be incurred for the fill material and removal. Sandbagging can be timeconsuming, however, and requires a significant amount of labor.\nIncorporating elevated development into the design of a new house adds $2,000 to $30,000 to the cost of the house depending on its size and foundation type, while raising an existing building can easily be well over double this cost. The total costs for raising a building increase with building size and weight but are not directly related to building size. 16,17 Raising an area of land and/or raising surrounding infrastructure is much more expensive. The cost will vary depending on the amount and type of infrastructure being raised. Raising entire areas of land is very expensive because large amounts of dirt and fill must be transported to the raised site.\nAlthough not a widely used technology, floating development is expected to cost about the same as elevated development. Retrofitting a large and/or old building is often cost prohibitive compared to demolishing and rebuilding, unless the building has historic significance or some other intangible value. 19\nFloodable development can be integrated into facilities at little to no cost for new construction. Costs for neighborhood-level infrastructure to support floodable buildings (for example, a parking garage designed to hold flood water) vary greatly depending on the type and size.\nPrefabricated movable buildings, such as modular homes, are inexpensive to build and relocate relative to the cost of replacement. Costs for both construction and relocation increase significantly with size. Large buildings are generally not designed to be movable because the high cost and complicated logistics involved in regularly moving large buildings makes them cost prohibitive-especially when including the costs for multiple moves. In addition, retrofitting buildings to be movable can be expensive compared to demolishing and rebuilding when you add in the cost of relocation.\nCosts for drainage systems vary according to the area over which they are deployed and the size of flood they are designed to mitigate. Large-scale structural drainage systems, typically composed of concrete and steel, have a high cost that increases relative to the amount of area they are supposed to drain and have a cost on par with other heavily engineered structures. Localized drainage systems that simply drain water from a building or parcel into existing waterways are less expensive to install. In addition, manmade drainage systems require regular maintenance to inspect, repair, and clean the systems after large floods.\nFloodproofing a building is relatively inexpensive compared to other mitigation measures and usually increases the cost of new construction by 0 to 25 percent, depending on the desired level of protection.\nCosts vary depending on land value and the method of preservation. The cost of preserving land in a locality through fee-simple acquisition-or direct purchase-is equal to the assessed property value. Easements average 60 percent of the cost of fee-simple acquisition; a more accurate cost can be determined by calculating the present worth of the highest value land use that would be given up with the easement. 23 There are also maintenance costs and the potential loss of property taxes versus what could be generated if the land were to be developed.\nZoning is a low-cost option. Zoning to mitigate flood-related impacts can be incorporated into a municipality's existing zoning code. The local government bears the cost of developing zoning codes, reviewing development applications for consistency with the code, and enforcing the zoning code. These costs vary by the complexity of the zoning code, the volume of development application, and the area and level of enforcement.\nDevelopment fees are a low-cost option for local governments. The local governments pay for developing and implementing the ordinances and administering the system. Developers pay the fees to pay for infrastructure associated with new development. Development fees typically only cover construction costs, while maintenance or operating expenses are usually funded through taxes.\nCommunities can engage in a variety of activities to conserve, create, enhance, or restore wetlands, and specific costs will vary depending on the scope of the project and local conditions. Land acquisition can be a significant upfront cost. Wetland restoration can cost between $3,500 and $80,000 per acre, excluding land costs, and wetland construction typically costs between $35,000 and $150,000 per acre, excluding land costs. 27 Communities usually face additional costs for planning, long-term management, and monitoring, but maintenance costs are typically very low.\nThe cost of mangroves can vary widely depending on specific conditions. Land acquisition may be necessary to protect existing mangrove forests. If restoration is needed to maintain mangrove forests, the price of labor and the extent of necessary earth work will dramatically affect costs. In general, mangrove restoration has been estimated to cost between $2,150 and $81,000 per acre, excluding land costs. 28\nDepending on size, constructing an oyster reef can cost between a few thousand and several million dollars. On average, oyster reef restoration costs about $100 to $150 per linear foot. 31 Oyster reefs have very low maintenance costs. Oyster reefs are extremely durable and may last for 50 years or longer.\nCreating living dunes is a relatively economical option and can be undertaken at the community level using widely available tools. Locally-appropriate vegetation can be obtained from nursery stocks or from nearby intact dune systems. The most commonly used species in dune transplantation are American beach grass, European beach grass, sea oats, and bitter panic grass. American beach grass is sold in 100stem bundles for approximately $35 to $55 per bundle. 34 The stems are planted two or three to a hole at 1-to 3-foot intervals, resulting in a cost of under $0.50 per square foot of dune. 35 Plantings can be done by hand or with a mechanical planter. 36 New plantings require periodic watering for the first few months and fertilization for up to two years. Decreased access to the beach due to planting vegetation can result in additional costs such as offsetting the loss in access by enhancing or maintaining other beach access points.\nBarrier island restoration is a large-scale undertaking and can cost tens or hundreds of millions of dollars. For example, restoring East Grand Terre Island in Louisiana, which included restoring 2.8 miles and 620 acres of barrier shoreline and 450 acres of marsh by dredging 3.3 million cubic yards of offshore material, cost $31 million. 39 In addition, barrier island restoration projects require periodic maintenance to ensure resiliency."}, {"section_title": "Effectiveness", "text": "TDR can be a highly effective and long-term solution to mitigate impacts of coastal flooding, as long as the development parcels are moved out of harm's way-to higher, further inland, and more protected areas.\nMuch like TDR, PDR is an effective and long-term solution; however, because participation in a PDR program is voluntary for the land owner, the programs can take a long time to implement over a large area. The PDR programs that would be most effective for limiting damage from coastal flooding are those that create large and contiguous areas with permanently preserved open space to serve as a buffer between flooding and development.\nWhen rolling easements lead to the removal of existing structures, they can prevent future flood damages in structure no longer subject to repeated or sustained inundation, but the value of the structure is also lost. Rolling easements are, however, a long-term strategy for potentially discouraging new housing developments along shorelines because they create the expectation that shoreline development will not be protected from flooding and erosion with engineered barriers or other types of coastal armoring. Thus, rolling easements have the potential long-term effect of mitigating future floodrelated damage. Rolling easements can be most effective when implemented along undeveloped stretches of shoreline.\nFee simple acquisition is highly effective because the public owns all rights to the land and can restrict development for as long as it maintains ownership.\nRelocation is effective if the infrastructure is moved out of the vulnerable area. If the infrastructure is not moved completely outside the vulnerable area, the overall effectiveness depends on the exposure and resilience of the infrastructure to coastal flooding.\nSurge barriers prevent storm surges from entering interior areas for water-level increases up to what they are built to withstand. The technology effectively reduces the height of extreme water levels in the area behind the barrier. For movable barriers, a storm surge monitoring and forecasting system must be used to ensure that the barrier is moved into position before a storm surge arrives.\nBeach nourishment is a short-term solution that protects people and property by decreasing the energy of waves and limiting how far inland storm surges travel. Beaches must be supplemented with additional quantities of sand every few years, however, for this measure to continue to be effective. Beach nourishment is very effective against water-level increases up to the beach height; for larger events that greatly exceed the beach height, however, beach nourishment will have a minimal effect on mitigating coastal flooding, and the flooding levels will be similar to what they would be without the measure.\nLevees can provide a high degree of protection against flooding in low-lying coastal areas. Effective levees are built with a high volume of material to resist water pressure, sloping sides to reduce wave energy, and crest heights sufficient to prevent overtopping by flood waters. Levees prevent flooding until they are overtopped with water or are breached (i.e., broken or eroded away), at which point flood waters will rise about as high as they would without a levee.\nSandbags are usually effective at temporarily mitigating flood damage. They are most effective when used to build barriers that are less than 4 feet tall. 14 Taller or poorly constructed barriers can be prone to sliding and overturning. Sandbags are also susceptible to water seeping through or beneath the bags. Sandbags should be used to provide a basic level of protection, but they are unlikely to hold back flood waters entirely.\nElevated development is effective in protecting buildings and infrastructure from floods at water levels lower than the base of the first floor of the raised facility and is generally effective for the expected life expectancy of the structure, which might range from 25 to 50 years.\nFloating development is an unproven technology for modern and dense development. Theoretically, it is effective for protecting buildings from floods at water levels lower than the maximum height to which the building is designed to float. Floating development is designed to be effective for the life cycle of the building.\nFloodable buildings are designed to be effective at preventing structural damage from floods up to a specific height. Supporting floodable infrastructure, such as a water-holding parking garage or pond, can hold a specific amount of water, making it easy to calculate how well the structure will mitigate flooding.\nThe ability to physically move buildings outside of an at-risk area eliminates damage to buildings from flooding. The logistics of moving a large number of buildings are complex, however, because of the time involved. Being able to move buildings requires advance flood warnings as well as sufficient transportation infrastructure to support the movement of both people and buildings.\nWhile building, parcel-sized, and more localized drainage systems can be designed to accommodate specific-size flood events, large and more regional systems are hard to design, integrate, and maintain. As such, the overall effectiveness of these systems is not very predictable.\nUsually floodproofing is designed to reduce but not completely eliminate the amount of damage for a given level of flooding. Floodproofing involves the recognition and acceptance of certain amounts of damage for specific flood levels and is only effective up to these predetermined levels. Dry floodproofing is effective up to a certain water-level increase, after which the force of the water acting on the structure can cause it to collapse.\nFor as long as the open space is preserved, designating vulnerable areas as undevelopable is highly effective at preventing flood-related damage in those areas by reducing the amount of infrastructure that could be exposed. Effectiveness is most often evaluated by modeling the impacts of flooding under different open-space and development scenarios.\nThe effectiveness is directly related to the regulations that the zoning implements and the associated enforcement. For example, preventing any development is highly effective, while requiring raised and flood-proofed structures is moderately effective at preventing future damage.\nDevelopment fees are an effective way for local governments to pay for new infrastructure to mitigate potential future impacts of coastal flooding brought about by new development. Thus, the effectiveness of the development fees depends on the success of the chosen infrastructure at mitigating flooding damage.\nWetlands reduce the risk of property damage and loss of life from flooding through a number of mechanisms. Wetlands act as natural reservoirs, storing flood waters and then slowly releasing them, delaying and attenuating peak flood flows. Wetlands also dissipate wave, wind, and storm surge energy through resistance provided by the wetland vegetation. Studies have found that a loss of one hectare (about 2.5 acres) of wetland corresponds to an average increase of $33,000 in storm damage from hurricanes. 26 However, wetlands are less likely to be effective in mitigating the effects of very large flood events, particularly regional floods of long duration.\nMangroves can reduce storm surge levels by slowing the flow of water and reducing surface waves. Experts estimate that each kilometer of mangrove forest provides a 5-to 50-cm water level reduction. In addition, surface wind waves are expected to be reduced by more than 75 percent over 1 kilometer of mangroves. 29,30 However, some models indicate that mangrove forests may provide less protection against intense, slow-moving hurricanes.\nReefs function as natural breakwaters that reduce the height and energy of waves hitting the shore. According to the Nature Conservancy, in Louisiana, two oyster reef restoration projects, with a total length of 3.6 miles, are expected to reduce wave height by 51 to 90 percent and wave energy by 76 to 99 percent. 32 This reduces both shoreline erosion and storm surge flooding. Reefs are particularly effective against smaller events but may provide limited protection against erosion and coastal flooding during major storms. 33\nDune vegetation, which acts to stabilize loose sand, is the most reliable way to protect dunes from wind and waves. Dune plants are especially effective at trapping and holding windborne sand, promoting dune growth over time. Dune vegetation also decreases the wind velocity near the ground, reducing wind erosion at the sand surface. 37 Dune vegetation root networks can also help to stabilize the dune. Ultimately, the vegetation helps preserve dunes and enhances their ability to protect the coast from erosion and coastal flooding. Dunes are effective in preventing flooding up until the water-level increase exceeds the height of the dune, or until sufficient erosion occurs to cause the dune to collapse\nBarrier islands protect coastal communities from damage caused by waves and storm surge. Studies have indicated that the loss of barrier islands can increase wave height by as much as 700 percent during fair-weather forecasts. 40 Recent observations following hurricanes have shown that areas behind restored barrier islands weather storms much better than nearby areas. 41"}, {"section_title": "Barriers to Implementation", "text": "TDR can be legally complex to implement and is generally not quickly implemented. For a program to be effective, TDR requires purchaser demand for the development rights as well as willing sellers.\nBecause PDR programs rely on the voluntary participation of land owners, they generally are not quickly implemented. In addition, despite costing less than fee-simple acquisition, development rights can be prohibitively expensive for some local governments and are often tax-funded, which subjects PDR programs to political and economic risk.\nOne method for implementing rolling easements is by obtaining voluntary participation of land owners; this can make the easements difficult to quickly implement, however, because property values are negatively impacted and existing structures cannot be protected with coastal armoring. Additionally, regulatory approaches toward implementation can often be legally complex.\nThe mechanisms for executing and financing fee-simple acquisition can be challenging. If property owners are unwilling to sell, the local government must exercise eminent domain in order to execute the purchase. Additionally, large-scale purchases can be prohibitively expensive for local governments to finance, although grants are sometimes available to help counties acquire important coastal lands.\nSome types of infrastructure (e.g., power, water, and communication lines) are relatively easy to move, while larger structures, such as power plants, large highways, and water treatment facilities, are not. These larger structures also require relocating supporting infrastructure, such as feeder pipes, substations, and distribution lines that connect them to the existing infrastructure. In addition, new utility facilities can require large areas of land and the establishment of new utility lines, which sometimes must be routed through private property.\nSignificant environmental costs as well as impacts on waterway transportation can be substantial barriers to implementation.\nInitial cost and frequent maintenance typically are the largest barriers to implementation. Finding adequate and suitable sand may be a challenge in some areas. Additionally, the question of who pays and who benefits may lead to some outcries about fairness in terms of spending money to protect and potentially increase the value of a small number of beachfront properties. The permitting process could also be slow, given the potential for negative environmental impacts.\nThe high volume and sloping shape of levees necessitates a large building footprint. This factor will be especially important in areas with high property values. Fact Sheet A-10: Sandbagging Sandbagging is a simple and common way to prevent or reduce flood damage. A sandbag is a sack made of burlap, polypropylene, or other material that is filled with sand or soil. Sandbags are stacked to build temporary barriers to hold back flood waters. The bags can be brought in empty and filled with local sand or soil.\nSandbagging requires a significant amount of labor that must be mobilized quickly before a storm.\nThere are rarely major barriers to implementing elevated development into new construction. Cost to implement, particularly for larger and older buildings, as well as the potential for structural damage, are major barriers to raising an existing building. Creating sufficient access for the handicapped and elderly is also a potential concern. Potential legal liability can hinder being able to raise roads in existing developed areas, because the government entity raising the road is then responsible if drainage patterns are altered and increased flooding results.\nTheoretically, there are few barriers to incorporating floating development into new construction. The main technological constraints are related to building size. Retrofitting an existing building with a floating foundation can be challenging. The process of setting a building on a new and potentially unstable foundation can result in structural damage. 20\nDesign-related challenges are associated with floodable buildings because structures must be engineered to withstand regular flooding. Depending on the size of larger scale retention structures, coordination with multiple public and private land owners as well as other stakeholders may be required to work through large-scale planning or land-use issues.\nThere must be designated receiving areas where the buildings will be relocated. These areas must be out of the flood zone but close enough to allow the buildings to be quickly relocated. In addition, planners will want to consider whether utilities and infrastructure are in place to support the buildings for both temporary and permanent relocation.\nDrainage systems are straightforward to incorporate into development on a local and neighborhood level. Designing effective regional drainage systems can be complex, especially for densely populated areas.\nCost is typically the largest barrier to implementing floodproofing infrastructure.\nThe costs to purchase and manage open space present the most significant challenges to implementation because localities often lack the resources to fund effective open-space preservation programs. In addition, property owners can be unwilling to give up development rights or to sell land in prime waterfront areas.\nProcesses for changing zoning ordinances vary by state and locality. Often, proposed zoning amendments must go through a lengthy review process that includes public involvement as well as approval by a local board or city council. Zoning that restricts development is sometimes a controversial and unpopular strategy, and may lead to legal challenges.\nNot all local governments can enact development-fees because laws and enabling legislation for these fees vary by state. 25\nConstruction of new wetlands may not be well-suited for highly developed areas, where there is often no land available or the land can be costly.\nMangroves have a limited geographic range due to climate. The temperate climate found in most of the United States is not suitable for mangrove growth.\nReef restoration has been known to cause environmental problems. If done irresponsibly, restoration may introduce invasive species to the ecosystem, placing native species at risk. When constructing a reef it is important to take local conditions into account. Seafood safety concerns mean that oyster restoration is not allowed in some locations. \nDunes can sometimes block views of the beach and projects to create new dunes often require landowners to cede some property rights for dune development.\nCost is typically the largest barrier to restoring barrier islands."}, {"section_title": "Special Considerations", "text": "In some cases, a buyer, such as the local government or a nonprofit organization, may purchase the development rights to hold or sell them at a later date. In this case, the buyer could choose to permanently retire the development rights for conservation purposes Fact Sheet A-2: Purchase of Development Rights Purchase of development rights (PDR) involves a local government or nonprofit purchasing development rights while the land remains privately owned. This restricts the future use of a property from certain types of development and is often used to preserve open space or farmland. In the context of coastal flooding, this can be used as a measure to prevent future development from occurring in vulnerable areas. PDRs are usually administered through a local government and often performed in collaboration with a nonprofit or trust that manages preservation activities.\nPDR usually only limits future development of housing, commercial, and similar functions; it does not remove existing development on a piece of land and does not prevent all future use of that land. The agreements generally allow the current land owner to stay on the land and, unless explicitly stated, do not prevent other activities, such as mining and farming. \nRolling easements have sometimes been relaxed or removed in future years if the public starts becoming more sympathetic with regard to the destruction of waterfront housing. \nIf local governments choose to pursue this through a forced buyout-or eminent domain-the process, cost, and ability of local governments can vary significantly depending on location. \nRegionalization can be an effective way to move critical infrastructure away from flood-prone areas; however, this approach can also increase the overall level of vulnerability, because if the infrastructure is damaged, the impact will be felt over a larger area. Additionally, relocating critical infrastructure components could limit the accessibility for some vulnerable populations.\nMany closure dams are outfitted with turbines to produce electricity from tidal energy. One concern is that closing barriers might cause additional flooding behind the closure during heavy rainfall because the water would not be able to escape the protected area. Fact Sheet A-7: Beach Nourishment As beaches erode, coastlines move inland, closer to people and property along the shore, and storm surges are more likely to flood coastal areas. Narrower beaches also expose dunes to wave action and erosion, which negates the protection they offer to coastal infrastructure. 7 Beach nourishment, also known as beach replenishment or renourishment, is a common strategy used to combat such erosion and flooding along sandy coastlines. It involves dumping or pumping high-quality sand from an outside source to replace sand lost to erosion. Nourishment typically uses dredges, trucks, or conveyor belts to move sand from one location to the other. By replacing sand lost to erosion, beach nourishment creates a wider beach, which can help mitigate potential damage to coastal property, It can also cause waves to begin to break farther from the shoreline, weakening their strength before they reach the beach.\nBeach nourishment expands the size of beaches, which could lead to increases in beach-related recreation and associated tourism revenues. Nourishment can have an unintended effect of creating a \"false sense of security\" for existing or new property owners who underestimate the vulnerability of areas landward of the beach. Fact Sheet A-9: Levees and Dikes Levees, also known as dikes, are constructed embankments designed to reduce the risk of flooding to the areas behind them. Levees are typically built parallel to the course of a river or along coastlines in order to contain, control, or divert the flow of water. Levees are constructed from compacted soil or artificial materials such as concrete or steel. To protect against erosion and scouring, earthen levees can be covered with grass and gravel or a hard surface like stone, asphalt, or concrete.\nDisposing of sandbags after a flood can be problematic. Sandbags that have been exposed to water cannot easily be reused. Wet sandbags tend to start deteriorating after a few weeks and may be contaminated by unsafe materials in the flood water. Disposing of the bags requires a considerable effort and generates a significant amount of solid waste. Fact Sheet A-11: Elevated Development Elevated development involves physically raising infrastructure (e.g., on stilts/pilings or raised land) so that water can temporarily flow underneath and/or around without harming the main structure. 15 Elevated development can be included in the original design or added as a retrofit. Traditionally, only buildings are elevated, while the surrounding infrastructure (e.g., roads, walkways) is not; thus, while a building may be protected from flood damage, access to it may be limited during a coastal flood. It is possible to raise surrounding infrastructure, including roads, bridges, walkways, and utility lines. One common example of elevated development is beach homes that are built on stilts, often with the first floor at a height of 10 feet or more above ground level. Elevating structures is a relatively easy feature to incorporate into the design of a facility or infrastructure during initial construction, but it is more challenging to incorporate as a retrofit. Physically raising a structure that is already elevated slightly (e.g. with a crawlspace) is more feasible than elevating \"slab-on-grade\" construction.\nFloating development is susceptible to damage from wind, waves, and currents from storms. Therefore, it is only effective in relatively protected areas, not in open water along the coastline, which is susceptible to high-energy waves. 18 http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/27/as-sea-levels-rise-dutch-see-floating-cities/ 19 http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/2012/05/preparing-for-a-life-on-water-with-floating-architecture.html 20 http://www.spur.org/publications/library/report/strategiesformanagingsealevelrise_110109 Fact Sheet A-13: Floodable Development Buildings can be designed to allow water to flood the lower floor(s) while causing minimal structural damage to the walls, floors, and foundation. On a larger scale, floodable development can also include structures and green infrastructure designed to capture, retain, and gradually release water when the flood recedes. This helps guide flood water away from more sensitive infrastructure. Examples include large underground storage systems such as parking garages designed to hold flood waters, as well as low-lying fields, ponds, or lakes designed to hold water drained from surrounding areas.\nFloodable development can be hazardous to health, particularly in seaward areas, because floodwater often contains high concentrations of organic chemicals, heavy metals, bacteria, and sediment and could leave behind contamination after the waters subside. 21 21 http://www.spur.org/publications/library/report/strategiesformanagingsealevelrise_110109 \nAdvance planning and early warning are needed to mobilize and coordinate building relocation in advance of a storm or flood.\nTrends for stormwater management increasingly focus on managing flooding and stormwater in place through infiltration and evaporation instead of draining into heavily constructed stormwater infrastructure that quickly moves the water off site. In addition, it is important to consider the downstream impacts of draining off large amounts of water and ensure that draining one area does not lead to damaging floods and erosion downstream.\nWhile floodproofing typically protects against certain water-level increases, these measures do not always account for a high velocity of water rushing in from the ocean, which can destroy structures.\nPreserving open space can also provides valuable social and environmental benefits based on the use of the open space, which may equal or exceed the flood mitigation benefits. 22 American Planning Association (2006). Planning and Urban Design Standards. 23 http://www.rff.org/RFF/Documents/RFF-Rpt-Kousky%20etal%20GreatLakes%20(2).pdf\nChanges to zoning amendments generally must be consistent with a local comprehensive or master plan, which describes the long-term land use goals for an area. Changes to the zoning code that are inconsistent with the plan could be subject to legal challenge. 24 24 American Planning Association (2006). Planning and Urban Design Standards.\nIf development fees make the overall cost of development in a particular place higher than in neighboring areas, developers may choose to build in another area or decide not to build at all, which can further increase the effectiveness of the measure in terms of minimizing development in vulnerable areas. 25 American Planning Association (2006). Planning and Urban Design Standards. Fact Sheet A-20: Wetlands\nWetlands provide a number of other valuable services, including improving water quality, providing fish and wildlife habitats, and maintaining water supplies during drought periods. 26 Anderson, Sharolyn J. and Kenneth Mulder (2008). \"The value of coastal wetlands for hurricane protection.\" Ambio 37(4): 241. 27 http://www.bnl.gov/erd/peconic/factsheet/wetlands.pdf\nMangroves offer the additional benefits of nutrient retention and wastewater treatment; they support fisheries by serving as a breeding ground and serve as a home to a variety of other wildlife. 28 http://el.erdc.usace.army.mil/elpubs/pdf/vnrs3-2.pdf 29 http://coastalresilience.org/sites/default/files/resources/storm-surge-reduction-by-mangroves-report.pdf 30 http://conserveonline.org/workspaces/naturalcoastalprotection/documents/reports/view.html\nReef restoration offers a number of additional benefits beyond coastal protection. For example, reefs can improve water quality and help maintain a healthy coastal ecosystem, promoting commercial and recreational fishing, recreational boating, and tourism.\nSpecial care must be taken in the selection of plant species to avoid introducing invasive species into the ecosystem. 34 http://www.town.orleans.ma.us/pages/orleansma_parks/whgreport.pdf 35 http://www.whoi.edu/fileserver.do?id=87224&pt=2&p=88900 36 http://140.194.76.129/publications/eng-manuals/EM_1110-2-1100_vol/PartV/Part-V-Chap_7.pdf 37 http://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/58856/1/2.5.Olafson.pdf\nIn many cases, barrier islands help shelter wetlands, so restoring barrier islands can indirectly preserve many of the benefits of coastal wetlands. This approach uses the same basic three-step approach as monetizing infrastructure-level data; however, it provides some lower-resource alternatives if you don't have appropriate infrastructure-level data or are just looking for a quicker means for developing a preliminary estimate of the monetized damage impacts. For example, you may not have data showing the height of water around your infrastructure, which would require you to estimate a depth-damage function, or you may not have infrastructure-level economic valuation data, which might require you to apply a generic economic value such as average building value per square foot or average price per building. Take advantage of your available economic expertise to help you consider and perform alternatives, but remember that more estimates and generic data typically yield less informative and compelling results."}, {"section_title": "Fact Sheet A-3: Rolling Easements", "text": "Rolling easements are enforceable legal agreements that prohibit engineered barriers or other types of coastal armoring and that require removal of structures seaward of a migrating shoreline. 3 Rolling easements ensure that the shoreline will move naturally, and the shoreline is specifically defined (e.g. mean high water, vegetation line, or the upper boundary of tidal wetlands.) As the shoreline erodes or is inundated by sea level rise, existing development that ends up seaward of the defined line must be removed from harm's way. The easements may also potentially discourage future development in these areas. As the shoreline continues to recede, the easement \"rolls\" farther inland. The intent of rolling easements is to allow natural erosion to take place, which preserves natural sediment transport systems, wetlands, and other tidal habitats. 4 Easements can be purchased by a local government, donated by the land owner, or carried out through zoning."}, {"section_title": "Fact Sheet A-4: Fee-Simple Acquisition", "text": "Fee-simple acquisition involves the outright purchase of property and all associated development rights. Fee-simple acquisition is often used when local governments purchase waterfront properties that are vulnerable to erosion and flooding. 5 In the context of coastal flooding, the purpose of the acquisition is to remove or prevent future development in vulnerable areas and to reduce future damage from coastal flooding. Fee-simple acquisitions can be used in conjunction with other managed retreat policies to preserve open space, which in turn can be used to implement other mitigation measures, such as wetlands development or green infrastructure, to further increase a community's resilience to coastal flooding."}, {"section_title": "Fact Sheet A-5: Infrastructure Relocation", "text": "Infrastructure relocation involves moving vulnerable infrastructure to areas less susceptible to coastal flooding.

One way to shift the function to a less vulnerable area is through regionalization (e.g., expanding capacity at an existing waste water treatment plant in a less vulnerable area to eventually replace another wastewater treatment plant in a vulnerable area)."}, {"section_title": "A-6", "text": "What Will Adaptation Cost?

Typically, only individual buildings are constructed on floating foundations, not the surrounding infrastructure. Although there are few common and widely used examples of floating buildings, architects have developed designs that add minimal cost to new construction. Retrofitting an existing facility with a floating foundation would prove challenging, and success would depend on the structure size, age, and type of foundation. Floating development becomes more difficult for buildings with larger weight-tofoundation-size ratios and taller buildings due to the potential instability of a floating foundation. 18"}, {"section_title": "Fact Sheet A-14: Movable Buildings", "text": "Movable buildings are designed to be easily relocated in advance of flooding or storm events.

You will need economic expertise for this approach."}, {"section_title": "Process to Perform This Approach", "text": "Step 1: Determine the height of the water around your assets, or at least identify exposed assets. Develop a GIS flood map containing information about which infrastructure elements are flooded, and preferably the depth of flooding around each infrastructure for each water-level increase selected. See NOAA's Mapping Coastal Inundation Primer for more detailed information about creating these mapping layers. An even lower-resource approach would just be to estimate the number or percent of buildings that are inundated from a quick view of your flood map. Step 2: Determine how badly the water damages your assets. Create or find depth-damage curves-functions that show the percent of damage to your assets (in this case building structure or content)-to determine the relationship between water-level height and percent of damage relative to the total value of the asset. Consider using generic depth-damage curves developed by U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) (see \"Key Resources\") for many different building types. If your flood map does not contain information regarding the depth of flooding around infrastructure, you may want to try to estimate the average flood depth around buildings and apply the appropriate depth-damage percent to all buildings. Step 3: Determine the value of your assets. Obtain generic economic data about the value of your assets (e.g., average price per square foot, average price per building) that makes sense to apply to your flood map. Only use an estimate of the price per square foot if you can assume how many square feet of the building are flooded. increase the accuracy of your estimate if you can obtain more specific values for different building types, such as the average price per commercial, residential, and industrial building.\nStep 1: Determine the amount of time a business is inoperable. For floods where substantial building damage is expected, the loss of business due to damage or destroyed buildings and equipment may be a substantial component of business interruption. See Table 14.12 of the FEMA Hazus-MH Flood Model technical manual for the expected restoration time of various building types due to flooding. This can help you estimate how long a business may be out of operation after a flood event. It is also possible that the primary business interruption may be caused by inaccessible roads or lack of electricity or water while crews are working to get utilities back up. In this case, you might expect businesses to be inoperable for several days to more than a week while the floodwaters retreat, utilities get back up, and businesses clean up from the flood. In this case, you may want to generate some more general assumptions, perhaps using data from historic storms, for the amount of time you can expect your businesses to be inoperable. Step 2: Determine the wages or output of a business. In Table 14.14 of the Hazus-MH Flood Model technical manual, FEMA provides data about the expected wages, income, and sales output per building type per square foot. You can multiply any of these variables by the number of days a business is inoperable to estimate business loss. Additionally, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages and the Census Bureau County Business Patterns provide data on the number of establishments and employees and total wages by industry type.
