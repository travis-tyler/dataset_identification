The average BMI was 23.2, and only one fourth of participants had a BMI above 25.

Although diverse in design and in their measures of glucose intolerance, the majority have shown that increased cancer risk, either overall or for particular cancer sites, is associated with glucose intolerance. The magnitude of the association of glucose intolerance or diabetes with risk for all cancers was small in the KCPS but was within the range found in some studies. 5, 6, 17 The multicancer site effect is consistent with postulated mechanisms of systemic consequences of hyperinsulinemia. 4, 5 In interpreting the findings of these studies and of the KCPS, potential confounding by obesity is of concern. In the KCPS, we found that the increased cancer risk associated with high serum glucose or diabetes was unchanged when controlling for BMI; additionally, most KCPS participants were not overweight. The association of serum glucose level with cancer risk did not vary by BMI (Figure 2 ). The study confirmed the excess risk of digestive cancers reported in several studies, 5, 6, 8 particularly of cancers of the pancreas, liver, esophagus, and colon among persons with diabetes. For pancreatic cancer, a 1995 metaanalysis of cohort and case-control studies estimated a 2-fold increase in risk of pancreatic cancer, comparing patients with and without diabetes. 18 The KCPS estimates were similar, and the HR increased with increasing fasting serum glucose level (Table 2 and Table 3) , as found in a Chicago cohort study. 4 Our prospective results, along with the Abbreviations: CI, confidence interval; HR, hazard ratio.

"}, {"section_title": "FASTING SERUM GLUCOSE AND CANCER RISK IN KOREANS", "text": "unchanged findings with exclusion of the first 5 years of follow-up, weigh against the possibility that the presence of pancreatic cancer increases blood glucose levels; ie, reverse causality. In the KCPS, we observed a significant positive linear trend for risk of pancreatic cancer with fasting glucose level: the HR was 1.7 (95% CI, 1.4-2.1) in men with diabetes and 1.5 (95% CI, 1.2-1.9) when data were restricted to men with at least 5 years of follow-up time. The complementary findings with these exposure measures, serum glucose level, and report of diabetes, and the presence of a doseresponse relationship with fasting serum glucose level support a causal interpretation of these associations. The findings for several other cancer sites further support this interpretation. In men, we found increased risks of cancers of the esophagus, liver, stomach, colon/rectum, kidney, and bladder and leukemia (Table 2) , while in women, risk was increased for cancers of the liver, lung, breast, and cervix (Table 3) . Other studies have also found increased risk for these cancer sites. 19, 20 In Korea, hepatitis B infection is common and is an important cause of liver cancer. 21 Serum glucose level was not associated with hepatitis B surface antigen status in the subset of participants with assay results, indicating that hepatitis B does not confound the results for liver cancer. On hospital admission diagnoses, we found little mention of nonalcoholic steatotic hepatitis, suggesting that the increased risk of liver cancer associated with higher serum glucose level reflects a direct pathway rather than an indirect pathway through obesity and fatty liver damage.\nFor prostate cancer, for both incidence and mortality, we found no evidence for an association with either fasting serum glucose level or diabetes (Tables 2 and 4) , consistent with other reports. One large, population-based Swedish cohort study found that men with diabetes had a 10% lower risk of developing prostate cancer than the general male population. 22 A reduced risk for men with diabetes was found in a case-control study in New York. 23 In contrast, the American Cancer Society's Cancer Prevention Study showed no association between diabetes at baseline and prostate cancer mortality, 24 and a study of incidence in 823 participants in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging also found association with fasting insulin and glucose levels. 20 The lack of association for prostate cancer weighs against observation bias as contributing to the positive associations for other sites; the medical care and frequent blood chemistries associated with diabetes might be expected to increase the opportunity for detecting prostate cancer, but the negative association is inconsistent with such bias.\nHyperinsulinemia has been cited as a possible risk factor for breast cancer, and supporting laboratory findings have been reported, 5 but results of epidemiological studies have been mixed. 25 In a recent publication based on the Nurses' Health Study, women with type 2 diabetes had a small increase in risk (HR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.01-1.35). The association was apparent among postmenopausal women but not among premenopausal women. 25 We did not find an association, although 95% CIs for our estimates covered the value from the Nurses' Health Study. With stratification at age 55 years, we did not find increased risk in the older stratum, corresponding to an age range when most women would be postmenopausal.\nThe potential limitations of our study result primarily from using data collected for clinical purposes. Serum glucose was measured under fasting conditions using clinical laboratories operating with standard quality assurance and control protocols in place. A single measurement of fasting serum glucose made for clinical purposes is used as a diagnostic standard and matches the World Health Organization's recommended approach for epidemiological studies. 26 We further relied on self-report of a diagnosis of diabetes; the serum glucose level of those with reported history of diabetes was 66 mg/dL higher than for those not reporting diabetes, suggesting that the self-reported information was valid. We do not anticipate that these clinical data would artifactually introduce association of cancer risk with fasting serum glucose level.\nCancer mortality is subject to misclassification on death certificates, particularly with regard to attribution to a particular site. The limitations of death certificate data on cancer have been characterized in some countries, 27 ,28 but we are uncertain as to the applicability of the findings of these studies in Korea. A small study within KCPS showed high validity for a death certificate listing of lung cancer. 29 Additionally, we have found that of KCPS participants with incident liver cancer, 73% of their deaths were attributed to liver cancer over a follow-up interval of at least 5 years. In Korea, cancer registration is not yet complete nationwide; it is currently estimated at 90%. 30 Consequently, we used hospital admission for cancer as a further indication of cancer incidence. We were able to take potential confounding by smoking and alcohol consumption into account and explored effect modification by obesity. We cannot attribute the associations of fasting serum glucose level and diabetes to uncontrolled confounding, particularly given the dose-response relationships observed with glucose.\nWhile the generalizability of the findings is uncertain, we have shown that fasting serum glucose level and diabetes are associated with cancer risk in a population far leaner than the Western populations in other studies. These associations do not reflect confounding by obesity, suggesting that the mechanism of increased cancer risk reflects the consequences of hyperinsulinemia. Glucose intolerance may be one pathway by which obesity increases cancer risk, and rising obesity may increase future cancer rates.\nAuthor Contributions: Dr Jee had full access to all of the data in the study and takes responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis.
