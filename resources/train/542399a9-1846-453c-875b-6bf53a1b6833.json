[{"section_title": "", "text": "The wedge for doing so is the observation that the decline in GDP growth coincides with a decline in firms' R&D productivity, measured as RQ ( Figure 1b). RQ (short for research quotient) is the firm-specific output elasticity of R&D in the firm's production function ( 2 ). Indeed mean RQ for US traded firms explains 54% of the variance in nominal GDP growth. To understand what triggered the decline in R&D spending, and how its effects may have propogated to produce permanent changes in firm behavior and productivity, I begin by comparing the relevant trends: macro-economics (interest rates), R&D spending (R&D/sales), R&D resources (scientists) 3 and R&D strategy (outsourcing). [Insert Figure 2 Here] Figure 2 suggests a sequence of contemporaneously rational, but partially irreversible decisions may have collectively degraded firm R&D productivity: a) high discount rates in the early 1980s reduced R&D spending; b) the reduction in R&D triggered divestment of nowsurplus resources (scientists); c) when R&D spending resumed, adjustments costs for new scientists drove firms toward outsourcing, d) outsourcing has lower productivity. To illuminate how R&D spending cuts might trigger this dominoing, we turn to a case study. The case follows Hughes Research Laboratories (HRL) ( 4 ). HRL was the central lab for Hughes Aircraft Company, the defense electronics firm founded by Howard Hughes in 1953, which grew to become a $15 Billion company known to \"tackle complex and long-term problems shunned by competitors\" ( 5 ). Because Hughes was a private company that relied on internal funding until its acquisition by General Motors in 1985, it was insulated from the interest rate shock. However it was later subject to an industry specific shock of even greater magnitude-the defense downturn following the end of the Cold War. In 1989, the associated budget cuts forced HRL to reduce its workforce to 400 from a peak of 560 two years earlier. While the workforce ultimately rebounded to 430 in 1993, this was still 23% below the peak--thus consistent with the domino hypothesis that reduced resource levels became semi-permanent features of firms' R&D strategies. Concurrent with the workforce reductions, HRL implemented a plan to give each division a $1 million budget to \"direct\" research at HRL. Previously, divisions contributed to HRL through their overhead, but had no say in how those funds were expended. Following the plan's implementation, divisions directed 20% of HRL funding. This shifted HRL's portfolio toward applied research. HRL Director, Dr. Arthur Chester felt one solution to the loss of basic research capability was outsourcing-taking greater advantage of the research capability at universities. In fact, the outsourcing solution was consistent with new CEO, Michael Armstrong's goal of bringing in more outside technology. While we don't observe what happens after the case, a number of HRL's scientists were concerned the shift toward outsourcing was irreversible: 1) after a time of not doing basic research, existing researchers would have lost touch, 2) new scientists capable of basic research would no longer be attracted to HRL, and 3) there would no longer be seeds for future projects. Thus the HRL case is roughly consistent with the domino hypothesis, and provides some insight into its mechanics. First, R&D budget cuts forced a permanent reduction in lab personnel as well as a shift toward more applied research. With insufficient personnel to conduct basic research, HRL began outsourcing to universities. I examine the extent to which dominoing occurred across the economy using data from the National Science Foundation Survey of Industrial Research and Development (SIRD) from 1973 to 2005. The SIRD is an annual survey of firms conducting R&D in the US. Since historically 69% to 75% of US R&D is performed by firms ( 6 ), this comprises the majority of US R&D activity. The SIRD is gathered from a sample intended to represent all for-profit R&Dperforming companies, either publicly or privately held. ( 7 ) Summary statistics are reported in Table S1. Step 1: The macroeconomic trigger. While the trigger in the HRL case was the coldwar downturn, a more likely trigger for remaining firms was interest rate spikes. Interest rates affect R&D through their impact on the net present value (NPV) 8 of projects. NPV is an investment decision tool used to capture the value in today's dollars for a stream of investments and returns that are spread out over time. Since the NPV of each project decreases with the firm's cost of capital, when interest rates rise, fewer projects have positive NPV. Accordingly, the total number of projects (and thus the total R&D budget) will decrease. To test the hypothesis that interest rates decrease R&D investment, I modeled firm R&D for firm i in year t, lnRDit, as a function of mean annual interest rate, \uf064t. I controlled for firm revenues, ln(Revenue)it, to capture the stylized fact that R&D increases with firm size ( 9 ) and estimated the model using firm fixed effects, \uf061 i . The main result is as expected. The coefficient of -0.007 implies that a percentage point increase in the interest rate decreases R&D 0.007%. Results for size are also as expected-a one percent increase in revenues increases R&D 0.5%. Step scientists because of severance packages and/or subsequent termination lawsuits. We call these costs of changing levels of investment, \"adjustment costs\". Because firms incur these adjustment costs, they are reluctant to hire or layoff scientists unless the new levels of R&D appear permanent. In essence these adjustment costs create a \"zone of inaction\" in the response to changes in demand. 10Accordingly, we should see the number of scientists grow and decline at a slower rate than demand. Further because hiring costs differ from termination costs, we should see hysteresis--response to growing demand differs from declining demand. To test this, I examine the set of firms with greater than ten firm-year observations. 11  Firms do however respond to declining demand. While still muted, the coefficient (-0.247) is ten times that for growth (and significant). [Insert Table 2 Here] Step 3: Outsourcing is a flexible substitute for labor. Firms can either tolerate the labor shortfalls when demand is growing (thereby reducing total R&D investment), or compensate for the shortfalls via outsourcing. What distinguishes outsourcing from labor is lower adjustment costs. Firms sub-contract for short periods and have no further obligation when those periods end. Given these lower adjustment costs outsourcing should be more responsive than labor to changes in demand. Results (Table 2-models 3 and 4) are consistent with that. Firms increase outsourcing at ten times the rate they increase labor --the coefficient on outsourcing, while not significant, is 0.268 versus 0.028 for labor. In contrast, outsourcing is not responsive to declining demand. The coefficient is essentially zero (0.055 and not significant). Also noteworthy is that the intercepts indicate outsourcing is growing in the absence of changes to demand. The implied rate is 70% when demand is growing, but it is 14.5% even when demand is declining. The combined effects of the intercepts and the response rates of the two inputs (labor and outsourcing) are depicted graphically in Figure 3. [Insert Figure 3 Here] Step 4. Outsourcing has lower productivity. As an additional check, I repeated the test and looked instead at the productivity of total R&D (the sum of internal, outsourced and foreign). In that case the coefficient on who outsources was significant. Because the first test rules out differences in internal R&D productivity, the second test suggests the lower R&D productivity of outsourcing firms stems from outsourcing itself. To investigate whether lower quality projects are driving the outsourcing result, I examine what happens to firms' internal R&D productivity surrounding the time they first outsource. I do this by creating eleven year dummies (one for the fifth year prior to first outsource, and one for each of the next ten years). I then regress firms internal RQs on the set of year dummies. If firms are merely outsourcing their lower quality R&D projects, their internal productivity should increase immediately after they shunt those projects to outsourcing. That doesn't appear to happen (S3). In fact, the mean coefficient prior to outsourcing (0.0006) is actually higher than post-outsourcing (0.0000), though not significantly. Thus it appears unlikely that project quality is driving the lower productivity of outsourcing. Since neither low quality firms nor low quality projects explains the lower productivity of outsourced R&D, it appears outsourced R&D inherently has lower productivity than internal R&D. What might drive that? One possible explanation for fundamental differences between the productivity of internal R&D and outsourced R&D is that R&D produces internal learning that can be redeployed throughout the firm. When R&D is outsourced that learning is captured by the performing firm. As an example, a recent study of banks adoption of internet banking find that firms who outsource the initial IT integration are less able to develop new applications and accordingly have lower revenues from their internet operations. 15An alternative explanation is that outsourced R&D is more costly to exploit and/or less likely to be exploited because key technical resources lie outside the firm. This explanation would be consistent with prior work in manufacturing showing that co-locating design engineers and manufacturing engineers dramatically reduced the duration and cost of automobile development ( 16 ). Similar effects have been found for technology outsourcing ( 17 18 ). Both explanations may be at play. However one clue as to which is more compelling is the productivity of foreign R&D. If the primary problem is costly handoff between developers and exploiters, we would expect those problems to be more pronounced for foreign R&D. That's not what we see. As shown earlier, the productivity of foreign R&D is higher than R&D outsourced to US firms (0.014 versus -0.007). Thus of the two explanations, loss of internal spillovers seems more plausible. While the question of why outsourced R&D has lower productivity than internal R&D is interesting and important, a related and equally important question is why firms persist with outsourcing. Again the data provide no insights here. However there is substantial evidence that firms don't know the underlying productivity of their R&D ( 19 ). Indeed the Industrial Research Institute (IRI) reports the need for better R&D metrics is a top concern of members. Its espoused benefits include reduced cost of R&D as well higher R&D productivity. Indeed the CEO in the Hughes case expressed a goal of increasing outsourcing to \"bring in more outside technology\". It is worth noting that outsourcing is just one form of open innovation. Another form-\"eternal knowledge sourcing\" for new innovation ideas appears to increase innovationmeasured as the percentage of sales from products introduced in the last few years ( 25 26 ). The key distinction between the two forms of open innovation is that external knowledge sourcing pertains to the locus of an existing idea (and includes customers, suppliers, etc), whereas internal R&D pertains to the locus for researching and developing an idea. While the questions of why outsourced R&D has lower productivity and why, despite the lower productivity firms persist with it, are ripe areas for future research, we have developed a plausible explanation for the broken link between R&D and GDP growth. It is that the recovery of R&D spending in the mid-eighties required investment in new resources. Uncertainty about future demand combined with substantial adjustment costs, led to slow expansion of R&D labor. This forced greater reliance on outsourcing. Unfortunately, it now appears outsourced R&D is unproductive for the funding firm.  1972 1974 1976 1978 1980 1982 1984 1986 1988 1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 interest rates    "}]
