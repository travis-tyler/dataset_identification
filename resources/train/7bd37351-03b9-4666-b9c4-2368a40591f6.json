[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) , was first reported in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China [1] . As of September 12, 2020 over 28 million COVID-19 cases and 916,992 deaths have been reported worldwide [2] . The growing significance of COVID-19 in the pediatric population has become more evident in recent months, as cases have grown from a reported 1.7% in April to 7.7% of total reported U.S. cases in August, 2020 [3] . Between July-August 2020 alone, 179,990 new cases were reported in children, a 90% increase [4] . While COVID-19 in children is often reported to be much less severe, analysis of pediatric COVID-19 hospitalization data from 14 states in the US found that 1 in 3 hospitalized children were admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) [5] . Awareness of the risk of serious long-term sequelae of COVID-19 in children such as Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) has increased [6, 7] . Hence, even amongst children with asymptomatic or mild disease manifestations, diagnosis and monitoring of disease course has become a key public health imperative as we seek to safely re-open schools and restart other public activities.\nEvaluation of the viral genome during a pandemic can aid in understanding not only the scale and epidemiology of the outbreak, but also provide valuable insights into viral evolution, including potential links to transmissibility and disease severity [8, 9] . Studies investigating SARS-CoV-2 genomes have identified mutations that could potentially alter viral pathogenicity and transmissibility [10, 11] , however few have focused on how this may impact pediatric COVID-19 patients and were limited in scope and sample size. As of September 1, 2020, California has 756,181 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 14,273 deaths [4] . The vast majority of these cases are in Southern California. Los Angeles County has the highest number of confirmed cases and second-highest reported deaths in the US [2] . However, genomic data from these cases are currently limited, with majority of the genomes deposited in GISAID database originating in Northern California [12] .\nUsing viral whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of clinical specimens we evaluated the associations between disease severity and viral genetic variations in children. This is the largest single institution pediatric COVID-19 case series with integrated clinical and genomic epidemiology reported to date. As such, it represents a significant contribution to the body of knowledge regarding the clinical, genomic, and epidemiological features of COVID-19 in children."}, {"section_title": "Study Population", "text": "Specimens from 141 COVID-19 patients were obtained from Children's Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA) between March 19 to June 16, 2020.

Clinical data including age, gender, ethnicity, hospitalization status, coexisting conditions, antimicrobial therapy, modes of oxygen supplementation, history of travel and contacts, clinical signs and symptoms, laboratory test results, and radiographic findings were obtained from the electronic medical record (EMR).

Most children in our cohort were of Hispanic ethnicity (95/141, 67.4%). Median age of the patients was 8.3 years (range: 10 days to 21 years), 53.2% were male and 13.4% (19) had underlying conditions. Sixteen (11.4 %) patients were admitted to the hospital, of which 14 (87.5%) were admitted due to COVID-19 related symptoms.

Thirty-three (23.2%) patients had direct contact with individuals positive for COVID-19 or URI symptoms suspicious for COVID-19 suggesting community transmission of the virus plays an important role in pediatric cases. No cases were associated with a positive travel history. Median time to discharge of hospitalized patients was 3.0 days and no deaths were reported in this period."}, {"section_title": "Clinical Characteristics", "text": "Extensive chart review was conducted on 88 patients with available inpatient and outpatient EMRs to capture disease severity, comorbidities and clinical course. The majority of patients were symptomatic (62/88, 70.5%), including two patients that were presymptomatic. Whilst the majority (52/62, 83.9%) of symptomatic patients experienced mild infection, 16.1% (10/62) had moderate or severe COVID-19. Three (4.8%) suffered from severe COVID-19 and were admitted to the ICU ( Figure  1 ). Six (4.2%) patients required oxygen supplementation. Six of 16 patients (37.5%) with chestimaging had opacities in the lungs and 2 had massive lung infiltrations ( Figure 1 ). Of the 7 moderate and 3 severe cases, 4 patients total were <1 year old (2 moderate and 2 severe cases). All 3 severe cases were acute with no progression to MIS-C. There were also no critical cases in this cohort.\nThe median viral load obtained from all positive results was 2.3 x 10 7 copies/mL (range: 81 to 1.0x10 12 copies/mL) with higher viral load detected in symptomatic compared to asymptomatic patients (2.7x10 8 vs 9.9x10 5 copies/mL, p=0.0007) (Figure 2A ). Patients tested within two days of symptom onset also had a higher viral load compared to samples collected >2 days from symptom onset (9.2x10 8 vs 2.4x10 7 copies/mL, p=0.001) ( Figure 2B ). All patients <5 years old were symptomatic and had higher viral loads (2.3x10 8 vs 1.9 x10 6 copies/mL, p=0.0004) ( Figure 2C) . No difference in viral load was observed in association with chronic underlying conditions, gender, or disease severity. Table 3 ). SNVs were located mostly in ORFs, with highest numbers in ORF1ab (n=231) and S (n=42) (Figure 3a, supplementary Table 3 ). The majority (10/15) of the insertion/deletions caused a frame-shift mutation in ORF1ab. Notably, the recently described D614G mutation in the spike protein [10, 22] , caused by nucleotide G-to-A substitution at position 23,403 in the Wuhan reference strain NC_045512.2 (Figure 3b, supplementary Table 3 ), was present in all but one of our isolates (140/141, 99.3%). There were two other mutations that co-exist with the D614G mutation in all isolates located in ORF1ab: F924F (c.2772C>T) is a synonymous mutation while P4715L (c.14144C>T) is a non-synonymous mutation (Figure 3b ). Using CHLA CARD [16] to assess the incidence of these variations globally, we compared our isolates to a global database of 77,966 SARS-CoV-2 isolates worldwide and found 41 variations unique to the isolates present in our cohort, while the remaining 329 variations were present in at least one other global isolate (supplementary Table 3 ). These 41 variants unique to our cohort include 18 missense, 10 synonymous, 10 frameshift, 1 inframe, 1 stop loss and 1 start loss. Interestingly, each of the 10 frameshift mutations was M a n u s c r i p t 7 detected in one isolate. The only other frameshift mutation found in the cohort is the c.361delA mutation in ORF8 that was also found in only one isolate in our cohort but reported 25 times previously according to CHLA CARD. While the clinical significance of these variations remains unclear, they point towards genetic heterogeneity of SARS-CoV-2 isolates circulating in Southern California."}, {"section_title": "Viral Characteristics and Genomic Diversity", "text": "Phylogenetic analysis of the 141 SARS-CoV-2 genomes demonstrated clustering with other isolates from the US and across the world (supplementary Figure 1 ). All but one of the isolates from our cohort belonged to 3 of the 5 phylogenetic clades (20A, 20B, 20C) defined by Nextstrain [17, 23] (  Figure 1, supplementary Figure 1 ). The majority (61.0%, 86/141) of isolates belong to phylogenetic clade 20C, a largely North American clade (Figure 1 ). There was limited evidence of early emerging genotypes of SARS-CoV-2 in this cohort. Only one isolate without the D614G variation in the spike protein belonging to phylogenetic clade 19B was identified and none of the isolates belong to phylogenetic clade 19A, which consists of the very first isolates from Asia ( Figure 1 ).\nThe estimated evolutionary rate was calculated to be 7.4 \u00d7 10 -4 substitutions per site per year yielding, based on the SARS-CoV-2 30kb genome, an overall mutation rate of 22.2 substitutions per year (supplementary Figure 2a) . The inferred time to most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) based on the molecular clock analysis of these isolates was 2019-12-24 (CI: 2019-11-25 -2019-12-26). To further investigate the association between viral isolates with the D614G mutation and the rate of viral evolution, we analyzed 577 viral genomes from California at different time points without the D614G mutation. The mutation rate of these isolates was 13.5 substitutions per year (supplementary Figure 2b ), substantially lower than what was observed for our isolates (supplementary Figure 2a) ."}, {"section_title": "Correlation Between Disease and Viral Genetic Variations", "text": "Comparison of viral sequences revealed significant variations across the viral genome, a subset of which are illustrated in Figure 2b . In fact, only 23 of 370 SNVs across the viral genome were present in more than 5% (7/141) of the isolates regardless of the disease phenotype of the patient (supplementary Table 3 ), which made attempts to examine potential associations of individual variants with disease severity significantly underpowered. There was some notable clustering for disease severity and phylogenetic clade, although the overall numbers were small. While the viral isolates detected from asymptomatic patients and patients with mild disease span all three phylogenetic clades (20A, 20B and 20C), LRTI was only seen in only patients with phylogenetic clades 20B and 20C, and more severe clinical course was only encountered in patients with phylogenetic clade 20C (Figure1, 3b) . In fact, 9 of 10 patients with either moderate or severe forms of COVID-19 were infected by virus from phylogenetic clade 20C, which is significantly higher (p = 0.0467, OR=6.95) than the fraction of patients with mild or asymptomatic infections (44/78) (Figure 3b) . No other segregation of clinical and demographic features including age, race/ethnicity, and presence of comorbidities based on viral genotypes was observed (Figure 1 )."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Pediatric patients can present with a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations associated with COVID-19, ranging from asymptomatic infections to severe illness. Over half of our 141 pediatric cohort was symptomatic with a subset requiring hospitalization. Four of 10 cases classified as M a n u s c r i p t 8 moderate to severe cases were in patients < 1 year, consistent with reports of this age group accounting for the highest percentage of hospitalization in pediatric COVID-19 cases [3, 24] . When compared to a recent MMWR summarizing signs and symptoms in 291 pediatric patients, shortness of breath (14.3%) or cough (49.2%) in our patient cohort was comparable but fever was more prevalent in our patients at 71.4% compared to 56% [25] . On the other hand, the hospitalization rate and ICU admission reported in our study was consistent with the estimated ranges reported of 5.7-20% and 0.58-2.0%, respectively [25] . However, only a small number of patients in our study experienced moderate illness with LRTI compared to approximately 65% of 171 children in China with confirmed COVID-19 [25] . These variabilities in disease severities emphasizes the critical need for pediatric specific studies to identify and/or confirm the possible contribution of host factors including age, ethnicity, and immune status.\nWe observed significantly higher viral loads in symptomatic patients and in children < 5 years of age, corroborating findings from a recent study that demonstrated a significantly higher amount of viral nucleic acid in young children [26, 27] . Association between viral load and days from symptoms onset is consistent with findings from other studies that reported detection of viral RNA as early as one day post symptom onset and highest viral loads in the first two days of symptoms onset [28] [29] [30] [31] . These findings have direct implications for infection control within the community and hospital setting.\nGenomic evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 in this cohort demonstrated that nearly all of our isolates carried the D614G mutation in the spike protein. The prevalence of this mutation in our patients earlier in the pandemic (95% in March/April) was particularly striking when compared to other California isolates in the GISAID database, which showed a 10% prevalence in February, 65% in March and not achieving a comparable prevalence of 96% until June. The D614G mutation is shown to have been rapidly fixed in isolates from Europe and North America and has been associated with lower Ct values in vitro and in vivo, but not with disease severity nor case fatality rates [10, 31] . The role of the D614G mutation in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity continues to be a focus of active investigation. While some studies suggest this mutation may increase transmissibility, a clear consensus awaits further investigation [32] [33] [34] . In this pediatric cohort the mutation does not appear to be a primary driver of disease severity as it was present in all spectrum of disease, ranging from asymptomatic to severe infection. We also identified the two common mutations (F924F and P4715L) alongside the D614G mutation in our isolates [35] . ORF1ab P4715L is located in Nsp12 which is important for viral replication. A comprehensive analysis of over 12,300 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences across 28 countries reported that mutation at P4715L and D614G may correlate with higher fatality rates [36] . Nevertheless the functional significance of these mutations still needs to be fully investigated. Confirmation of these observed mutations and better understanding of its potential significance will require sequencing and correlatives studies of larger numbers of pediatric COVID-19 cases.\nWe also observed an unexpectedly increased mutation rate (22.5 substitutions per year) in this cohort when compared to other SARS-CoV-2 cases from California without the D614G mutation during the same period (13.5 substitutions per year). The degree to which this difference reflects an underlying biologic difference versus the temporal and geographic dynamics of the pandemic in California remains to be determined. However, the effect of this higher than expected rate of mutation is readily apparent in the unexpected diversity of variation across the viral genome as illustrated in Fig. 2B . We postulate that the increased transmissibility caused by D614G may have M a n u s c r i p t 9 also led to this increased mutation rate. Nonetheless, the clinical and biological implications remain to be carefully ascertained.\nFrom a genomic epidemiology perspective, the isolates in our study almost exclusively belonged to the three most recent SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetic clades (20A, 20B, 20C) as defined in Nextstrain [17] . This is consistent with previously described patterns of multiple introduction and community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 lineages in California [37, 38] . Analysis of the genome sequences from the 22 pediatric patients in California not in this study that are currently available for evaluation confirmed the same 3 phylogenetic clades, but with a difference in clade distribution. In these cases phylogenetic clade 20A was most prominent (data not shown). The genetic diversity among the isolates points to multiple potential introductions of the virus in Southern California from across the US and the world. An unexpected finding in our cohort was an apparent association between disease severity and clade 20C. Recognizing the limitations of small case numbers, it is notable that all severe cases and all but one moderately severe case fell into the phylogenetic clade 20C. Two additional mutations (C1059T and G25563T) differentiate phylogenetic clade 20C from 20A and 20B and at least one of these may potentially be associated with increased disease severity [39] . G25563T leads to the Q57H missense mutation ORF3a that is associated with host cell apoptosis and contribute to increased infectivity and virulence [40, 41] . Confirmation of the effect of these mutations, as well as well as further exploration of the genotype-phenotype correlation of phylogenetic clade 20C, warrant further examination in larger scale pediatric populations.\nThere are some limitations that warrants discussion. First, this is a single-center study on 141 pediatric patients in Southern California with clinical characteristics available on 88 patients. Although we observed interesting associations between viral genotypes and disease severity, this study was not sufficiently powered to establish a statistically significant correlation between individual viral genetic variations and disease severity. Finally, due to the over-representation of Hispanic population (67.3%) in our pediatric cohort, the clinical and genomic findings from this study may not reflect all ethnic groups. Notwithstanding the predominant Hispanic population in this cohort, 6 of the10 moderate or severe cases occurred in non-Hispanic patients. Data from a larger and geographically diverse pediatric population will be required to better characterize these potential associations between disease severity and viral genetic variations.\nThis study represents the largest single institution pediatric COVID-19 case series with integrated clinical, genomic, and epidemiological characteristics in the US. While we observed limited shared variations between the isolates, our findings demonstrate unique variation in each isolate at the cohort or population level including observation of moderate and severe COVID-19 cases corresponding almost exclusively to phylogenetic clade 20C. Furthermore, the majority of these variants led to amino-acid changes in the viral proteins, possibly indicating an ongoing adaptation of the virus in human population. This genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 at the population level has not been well appreciated in previous description of SAR-CoV-2 in children and suggests that substantial collaborative efforts will be required across multiple institutions to confidently establish an association between genetic variations and any specific disease manifestation in pediatric COVID-19 patients.
