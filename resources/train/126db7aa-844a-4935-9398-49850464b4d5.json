The most noticeable impact of RSL rise is the increasing frequency of high tide flooding (HTF) that in 2018 was 1) disrupting vehicular traffic along the U.S. East Coast due to flooded roadways, 2) inhibiting parking and thus slowing commerce at stores in downtown Annapolis, Maryland, 3) raising groundwater elevations and degrading septic system functionalities in South Florida, and 4) salting farmlands within coastal Delaware and Maryland. In 2018, the national annual HTF frequency reached 5 days (median value) and tied the historical record set in 2015. HTF was most prevalent along the Northeast Atlantic Coasts (median of 10 days) and broke records within the Chesapeake Bay (e.g., 22 days in Washington D.C. and 12 days in Annapolis and Baltimore) and along the Eastern Gulf of Mexico Coasts with some major flooding from several hurricanes. In all, 12 individual (out of 98 U.S. tide gauge) locations broke or tied their HTF records. There are now over 40 locations whose HTF decadal trends reveal significant acceleration (nonlinear increase) and 25 locations whose HTF trends are linearly increasing, implying that impacts will soon become chronic without adaptation. HTF in 2019 is projected to be higher than normal at about 40 locations along the U.S. West and East Coasts in part due to a minor El Ni\u00f1o that is predicted to persist until early next year. The national median HTF frequency is projected to be more than 100% greater than it typically was in 2000. Regionally in 2019, the Northeast Atlantic is projected to experience a median of 8 days of flooding, which is a 140% increase since 2000. Flooding along the Southeast (5 days-190% increase over 2000), Eastern Gulf (3 days-100% increase since 2000) and Western Gulf (6 days-130% increase since 2000) Coasts continues to rapidly increase as well. The U.S. Southwest and Northwest Pacific Coasts are projected to see a median 2 and 6 days of flooding (80% and 20% increase since 2000), respectively. Annual flood records are expected to be broken again next year and for years and decades to come from RSL rise. Projecting out to 2030 and 2050 provides vital information for communities that are already taking adaptation steps to address coastal flooding impacts and those that are beginning to assess future flood risk in their communities. Bounded by a range of RSL rise under a lower and continued-high emission rate, today's national HTF frequency of 5 days (national median) is likely to increase to about 7-15 days by 2030 and 25-75 days by 2050 (HTF range: low emission-high emission values), with much higher rates in many locations. vi"}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Coastal flood risk causing minor-to-major impacts is changing because of ongoing relative sea level (RSL) rise ( Figure 1). Flooding that decades ago usually happened only during a powerful or localized storm can now happen when a steady breeze or a change in coastal current overlaps with a high tide (Sweet et al., 2009;2018a). Such high tide flooding (HTF) is happening often, and it is complicating preparedness and planning within coastal communities. The National Water Level Observation Network of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Ocean Service (NOS) has been in place at some locations for over a century. The network defines U.S. maritime boundaries, supports safe maritime commerce with real-time observations and tide predictions, and tracks dangerous storm surge. It now monitors how the steady creep of RSL rise is accelerating the frequency of HTF . NOAA NOS (Sweet et al., 2018a) defines HTF as heights ranging from about 0.5 meters (m) to 0.65 m above the mean higher high water (MHHW) level ( Figure 2a) and varying regionally with tide range. The HTF height thresholds are based upon the minor-flood thresholds set by NOAA National Weather Service (NWS) Weather Forecasting Offices (WFOs) and on-theground local emergency managers who prepare for response to impending conditions (NOAA, 2017). WFOs will typically issue a coastal flood advisory when NWS minor coastal flood thresholds are expected to be exceeded. Though the NWS flood thresholds are calibrated empirically from years of impact monitoring, they are valid for only particular parts of a city or region that has variable topography, urbanization, and storm-proofing. As a best-fit solution to the NWS thresholds ( Figure 2b: regressed with tide range), the NOS HTF thresholds provide a nationally consistent height threshold that broadly defines U.S. coastal infrastructure vulnerabilities to flooding. The amount of land along the U.S. coast exposed to HTF has been mapped by NOAA and is substantial (more than 2,700 square miles or slightly larger than the State of Delaware) as shown for the U.S. East and Gulf Coasts (Figure 2c). HTF is often referred to as 'nuisance' or 'sunny-day' flooding, but the impacts are disruptive and sometimes damaging, and its cumulative effects are becoming a serious issue in many coastal communities. HTF events, made worse by RSL rise, are contributing to overwash and beach erosion, overwhelming storm/waste/fresh water systems, disrupting harbor operations, closing roadways, and degrading subsurface infrastructure and property values. These impacts are nearly certain to get much worse this century (Fleming et al., 2018). This past year, reports describe how RSL rise and HTF are flooding roads and disrupting traffic (Jacobs et al., 2018), negatively impacting parking and commerce in downtown Annapolis, Maryland (Hino et al., 2019), raising the water table to ground level (Sukop et al., 2018) and degrading septic system functionality in the Miami region 1 , and laying waste to farm lands in the Delmarva Peninsula 2 . This report is the fifth in an annual series that provides annual and multi-decadal projections of HTF and helps keep the focus on important perspectives. It provides 1) an assessment of HTF that occurred in 2018 relative to measured flood-frequency trends, 2) maps of areas potentially exposed to HTF, 3) a 2019 outlook based upon temporal trends and predicted strength of the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and 4) projections based upon RSL rise likely to occur by 2030 and 2050. This information is intended to raise awareness of the growing impact of RSL rise through HTF and inform decision-making not only next year (e.g., budgeting and allocating for necessary coastal flood responses) but over the longer term (e.g., major infrastructure upgrades, and land-use planning) to ensure resilience to sea level rise impacts."}, {"section_title": "2018 CONDITIONS", "text": "In 2018 3 the national median annual HTF frequency reached 5 days, which tied the historical record of 2015 as measured by 98 NOAA tide gauges along U.S. coastlines 4 ( Figure 3). The rapid increase in HTF is largely in response to the RSL rise occurring along most U.S. coastlines. When assessing only the ocean rise component (separate from any vertical land motion) cumulative RSL rise since 1920 surpassed 25 cm along U.S. coastlines (median value) during 2018. Vertical land motion rates used to estimate the ocean rise component are from Sweet et al. (2017b). Median U.S. RSL rise (ocean rise plus vertical land motion) over the same time period topped 31 cm, which is also the second-highest amount (not shown). The acceleration of national HTF frequency over the last several decades largely is attributed to U.S. East and Gulf Coast locations where 42 locations have annual HTF frequencies that are now accelerating ( Figure 3b). HTF acceleration is and will continue to occur in more locations regardless of whether RSL trends are accelerating . Due to RSL rise, HTF thresholds have entered the bulk (as compared to the 'tail') of the water level probability distribution in numerous locations (e.g., Figure 1), implying that impacts will soon become chronic without adaptation, e.g., upgraded flood defenses. In addition to the 42 locations with accelerating HTF trends (significant nonlinear increase), there are 25 locations with HTF trends linearly increasing. The two locations outside the East and Gulf Coasts with accelerating annual HTF frequencies are San Diego, California and Kwajalein Atoll, Marshall Islands. There were 12 locations that broke or tied their HTF records during 2018 (Appendix 1). HTF was most prevalent along the Northeast Atlantic coastline with 10 \u00b14 (median \u00b11 standard deviation) days, and several HTF records were broken within the Chesapeake Bay (Figure 4). HTF records include 22 days of HTF in Washington D.C. and 12 days each in Annapolis and Baltimore. At least in the case of Annapolis, the record number of days with HTF caused parking and transport disruption in the downtown area and negatively impacted commerce (Hino et al., 2019). The highest number of days overall with HTF within the Northeast Atlantic was Boston with 19 days. Like Washington D.C, which is situated up a major river, Wilmington, North Carolina also broke its HTF record with 14 days during 2018. Measurements from these two NOAA tide gauges (and a few others) are affected by both storm surge and also the compounding effects of elevated river discharge (Moftakhari et al., 2017) from regionally heavy rainfall occurring across the watershed. Prolonged elevated discharge often occurs during spring at tide gauges located in East Coast rivers (Sweet et al., 2018a) but is possible at other times. Such an instance happened during and after Hurricane Florence in mid-September 2018 ( Figure 5) when water levels near the HTF threshold (about 0.55 m at both locations) persisted for weeks after a localized storm surge of about 1 m above MHHW. The Southeast Atlantic had 4 \u00b14 (median \u00b11 standard deviation) HTF days, which is largely reflective of the region between North Carolina and northern Florida where water levels are generally more responsive to weather/ocean forcing and from differing topo-bathymetric characteristics. HTF frequencies along the Eastern Gulf of Mexico (5 \u00b13 days [median \u00b11 standard deviation]) also broke or tied records (e.g., 10 days at Apalachicola, Florida and 8 days at Cedar Key, Florida) in 2018. The HTF records also included the effects of Hurricane Michael, a category 5 hurricane that came ashore along the Florida Panhandle in October 2018 and caused major flooding about 2.3 m above MHHW. Hurricane landfalls aside, annual HTF frequencies are mostly represented by smaller events closer to the HTF threshold (e.g., Figure 1). Maximum water levels in 2018 were less than 0.6 m above the HTF threshold along much of the East and Gulf Coasts and less than 0.3 m along the West Coast ( Figure 6). The Western Gulf coast experienced 8 \u00b1 8 (median \u00b11 standard deviation) days of HTF days during 2018 with no land-falling hurricanes. Eagle Point, Texas (Galveston Bay region), however, stands out at 27 days during 2018 and has been an anomaly over the last two decades 5 potentially in response to localized land subsidence with rates on the order of 1 cm/year 6 . It is unclear whether any localized impacts associated with HTF are apparent or disruptive within this community. In 2018 the U.S. Southwest Pacific Coast experienced 1 \u00b13 (median \u00b11 standard deviation) days of HTF with nearly all flooding occurring between Santa Monica and San Diego (Figure 4). HTF was 4 \u00b14 (median \u00b11 standard deviation) along the U.S. Northwest Pacific Coast where winter storms are more prevalent and where storm surges are of greater significance to inundation than tidal forcing (Serafin et al., 2017;Sweet et al., 2018a). The HTF threshold is higher than nearly all historical water levels measured by tide gauges along Hawaii, even those that recently caused 7 problematic flooding (Thompson et al., 2019). There have only been two instances of water levels in Hawaii exceeding the HTF thresholds: 1) at Nawiliwili during Hurricane Iniki in 1992 and 2) at Hilo following the March 1964 Alaskan earthquake/tsunami (meteorological year 1963). The HTF threshold is similarly extreme (or has not been exceeded) in tide gauge records within the U.S. territorial islands in the Pacific and Caribbean (see Appendix 1). In these locations, waves tend to be a more important contributor to total water levels (Serafin et al., 2017;) that cause erosion, overwash, and related impacts (Barnard et al., 2019). Future assessments might begin incorporating higher frequency/wave effects, which are measured but typically not reported by tide gauges (Sweet et al., 2015). In terms of public communication alerts of upcoming minor HTF impacts, NOAA NWS WFOs issue coastal flood advisories; if moderate or major coastal flooding is imminent, coastal flood warnings are issued (NOAA 2017) 7 . NWS minor flood thresholds that trigger coastal flood advisories closely relate to HTF thresholds (Figure 2b), so not surprisingly, the frequency of issuances is increasing as well. Viewed nationally using a traditional calendar year (Jan.-Dec.), WFO advisories (median value) are correlated (r=0.76) and accelerating ( Figure 7a) similar to the national HTF trend (Figure 3a). The national trends largely follow those along the U.S. East and Gulf Coasts, which are demonstrated by comparing tide gauge observed HTF to issuances from the encompassing WFO such as those for the New York City (Figure 7b), Norfolk, Virginia (Figure 7d) and the Galveston/Houston (Figure 7f) regions. The relationship between tide gauge HTF and WFO coastal flood advisory issuances is not significant in U.S. West Coast locations, as shown for Seattle ( Figure 7c) and Los Angeles (Figure 7e), possibly due to the influence of waves. During 2018 (calendar year), there were seven records broken for the total number of coastal flood advisories issued to the public, mostly along the U.S. East Coast (https://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/archive/). These results demonstrate the direct effects of RSL rise affecting coastal flood risk and weather forecasting that is guiding day-to-day decision making. "}, {"section_title": "2019 HIGH TIDE FLOOD OUTLOOK", "text": "The 2019 outlook is provided as the likely range expected flood frequency \u00b11 standard deviation) based upon updates of Sweet et al. (2018a). The projection is based on: 1) a 19-year (2000-2018) average where no trends exist, 2) an extrapolated linear or quadratic temporal regression trend fit and/or 3) an extrapolated statistical fit that also uses the strength of ENSO quantified by the Oceanic Ni\u00f1o Index 9 in a bivariate regression. Statistical fits use data from 1950 (or start of hourly observations) -2018. All trend fits are significant above the 90% level (p value <0.1). Multi-model ensemble predictions of ENSO strength for 2019/2020 were obtained from the International Research Institute for Climate and Society in April 2019 10 . A mild El Ni\u00f1o (ONI modeled at a 0.75 \u00b0C value) is predicted to persist into calendar year 2020. In response, higher than expected (above long-term average or trend values) flood frequencies are predicted at 42 locations primarily along the U.S. West and East Coasts (Figure 8a) as illustrated for San Diego, California and Norfolk, Virginia (Figure 8b). The 2019 outlook is shown in Figure 9, and for mapping purposes, it illustrates the expected value (not the \u00b11 standard deviation likely range, Appendix 1) using the ENSO-based predictions where significant. The Northeast Atlantic coast is projected to experience the most HTF in 2019 with the regional-median expected value of 8 HTF days. Individual locations are projected to experience more (likely range): 12-19 days in Boston, Massachusetts, 8-13 days in New York City region, and 10-15 days in Norfolk, Virginia. The Southeast Atlantic Coast is projected to experience 5 days (i.e., median value), with 4-7 (i.e., likely range) HTF days in Charleston, South Carolina and 1-3 days at Virginia Key (Miami, Florida region). Along the Eastern Gulf, 3 days of HTF are projected with most individual locations close to the regional values (e.g., 2-5 days projected at Pensacola, Florida). Higher frequencies of HTF are projected along the Western Gulf (6 days) with some substantial variability (discussed earlier) locally: 6-13 days at Sabine Pass, Texas, 29-40 days at Eagle Point, Texas (outlook is high due to anomalously high trend over the last couple of decades), and 1-6 days at Corpus Christi, Texas. The 2019 outlook for the U.S. Southwest Pacific coast is 2 days of HTF, with 5-9 days likely at San Diego, 1-4 days in Los Angeles, and 0-2 days at San Francisco. Along the U.S. Northwest Pacific Coast, 6 days of HTF is projected, with the exposed ocean sites projected to experience more (e.g., 6-12 days at Humboldt Bay, California and 9-21 days at Toke Point, Washington) and less within the Puget Sound region (e.g., 2-6 days in Seattle, Washington). HTF flooding is not projected to occur (not considering wave or rainfall effects) along the Hawaiian Islands or the U.S. Caribbean or U.S. Pacific Island territories; the exceptions are Midway Island (0-2 days) and Wake Island and Kwajalein Atoll (0-1 days at both). The 2019 HTF national outlook is expected to be over 100% greater (median value) than would have been typical in year 2000 (i.e., based upon individual trends fit for ENSO neutral conditions) as shown in Figure 10 (with values listed in Appendix 1). Annual HTF frequencies are rising the fastest along the Southeast Atlantic Coast (median value about 190%) and are also above 100% along the Northeast Atlantic (140%) and the Eastern and Western Gulf (about 100% and 130%, respectively). They are less substantial along the U.S. Southwest and Northwest Pacific Coasts (80% and 20%, respectively). Projected increases along the U.S. West Coast for 2019 largely reflect the predicted influence of El Ni\u00f1o, as for the most part, these locations are not yet experiencing either a linear or accelerating frequency in time (Figure 3b). Projected frequency increases in HTF are especially problematic in many of the older, low-lying East Coast cities that were built just above average highest tides. As sea levels have risen over the last century, stormwater systems are no longer able to perform as designed. HTF causes tidewater to fill stormwater pipes, which prevents rainwater from entering storm drains and causes increased impacts from flooding. Many of these gravity-driven systems are ceasing to function as designed, causing rainwater to flood streets and neighborhoods until the tide lowers and water can drain normally. This is exacerbated when extreme rainfall events coincide with higher tides (Carter et. al, 2018). The outlook methodology underpinning the 2019 outlook and earlier ones (e.g., Sweet et al., 2018b) are not intended necessarily to capture effects of rare events like hurricanes or abnormally high storm-surge/storm years. When rare extremes like hurricane landfalls or intense winter storms occur, they are capable of producing not only extreme water levels, but an anomalous number of days of high storm surge and/or high river discharge affecting some NOAA tide gauges. What the outlooks do provide is a method to predict HTF considering RSL effects (Figure 3), typical storm surge climatologies (e.g., Figure 1), and in some cases by utilizing ENSO predictions (Figure 8), which inherently lead to both higher sea levels and higher storm-surge frequency along large portions of the U.S. East and West Coasts. The outlooks will typically under-predict next-year's HTF frequencies due to RSL rise-forced responses to normal weather (storm surge) and tides, since the autoregressive HTF-trend characterization is becoming increasingly nonlinear through time ; Figure 1). Seasonal climatological distributions are provided in Sweet et al. (2018a), who note when HTF typically occurs most often and to what degree it is in response to predicted astronomical tidal forcing or (less predictable) stochastic weather effects. Ongoing efforts are underway to provide seasonal predictions directly (e.g., Widlansky et al., 2017). Comparing the HTF outlook from the previous year's report (Sweet et al., 2018b) to the 2018 observed floods (Appendix 1, Figure 4) gives some indication of expected accuracy of the projections presented here. About two-thirds of the HTF-day counts in 2018 at locations ( Figure  4) fell within the 'likely range' prediction (66 out of 98), with about one-third of the locations above prediction (29 out of 98). Only three locations with HTF days along the Southeast Atlantic Coast in 2018 fell below their respective 2018 outlook prediction. Of the 29 locations with HTF frequencies during 2018 above the likely range prediction, about half of those (14 locations) were above 2 standard deviations, including 9 of the 12 locations that broke or tied their historical HTF annual frequencies in 2018. Thus, it is anticipated that nearly all of the HTF days measured in 2019 will likely fall within or above the 2019 HTF outlook presented in this report. Figure 10.

Black dots denote locations where high tide flooding still occurs less than once a year, or in some cases, has yet to occur."}, {"section_title": "PROJECTIONS OF HIGH TIDE FLOODING LIKELY TO OCCUR BY 2030 AND 2050", "text": "The historical and 2019 HTF outlooks can be contextualized to longer-term projections. Changes in HTF frequency are estimated out to about 10 and 30 years (2030 and 2050) using multidecadal HTF projections of Sweet et al. (2018a). We utilize two scenarios of RSL rise that bound the range considered 'likely' this century in response to a lower and continued-high emission scenario by the U.S. Fourth National Climate Assessment (Sweet et al., 2017a). Specifically, the Intermediate Low and Intermediate Scenarios of Sweet et al. (2017b) are utilized. HTF projections under higher RSL rise scenarios as presented by Sweet et al. (2018a) are possible this century but, if they were to occur, would emerge toward the end of the century. In all cases, decadal values are averages over the preceding decade (e.g., 2030 = 2021-2030 average; 2018 values are 2011-2018 average) since the RSL rise scenarios provide only decadal resolution. These estimates are intended to characterize HTF frequency typical in most years by 2030 and 2050, though it is recognized here and elsewhere that interannual variability in tide cycles or climate mode variability affects flood frequencies in any given year (e.g., Men\u00e9ndez and Woodworth, 2010;Wahl and Chambers, 2016;Sweet et al., 2018a). Examples for San Diego, California and Norfolk, Virginia are shown in Figure 11 for historical and future projections of decadal HTF averages. The HTF frequencies continue to grow rapidly with continued RSL rise and in a very nonlinear fashion as the daily high-water distribution continues to impinge upon and surpass the HTF threshold ; as illustrated in Figure 1). Under the Intermediate projection, Norfolk will experience about 170 days/year of HTF, which by definition, suggests that MHHW (about 182 days per year exceeded) will nearly equate to the HTF threshold. Figure 11. Decadal averages of days with HTF both historical and projected into the future (Sweet et al., 2018a) using RSL rise projections bounding the 'likely' outcomes this century by the Fourth National Climate Assessment (Sweet et al., 2017a).

"}, {"section_title": "SUMMARY", "text": "NOAA tide gauges are measuring rapid changes across the entire severity-spectrum of coastal flood risk along U.S. coastlines due to RSL rise. The most noticeable impact of RSL rise is the increasing frequency of HTF (sometimes referred to as 'nuisance' or 'sunny day' flooding), which typically causes minor and disruptive impacts. However, within many rural and urban U.S. coastal communities, the cumulative effects of more HTF upon public-works systems, roads, first floors of businesses, and residences (among others) is becoming a serious problem. Because of this, communities need projections for 'next year' and for the coming decades for preparedness and planning purposes to respond to the growing RSL-related HTF threat. In 2018, the national annual HTF frequency reached 5 days (median value) and tied the historical record set in 2015 as measured by 98 NOAA tide gauges along U.S. coastlines. In all, 12 individual locations broke or tied their HTF records. There are now over 40 locations whose HTF trends reveal significant acceleration (nonlinear increase) and 25 locations whose HTF trends are linearly increasing, implying that impacts soon will become chronic without adaptation. HTF was most prevalent during 2018 along the Northeast Atlantic Coast and broke records along the Chesapeake Bay and the Eastern Gulf of Mexico Coast, where major flooding also occurred from hurricane-induced storm surge and heavy rainfall/river flows. HTF for 2019 is projected to be more likely than normal at about 40 locations along the U.S. West and East Coasts in part due to a minor El Ni\u00f1o that is predicted to persist until early next year. The national median HTF frequency is projected in 2019 to be more than 100% greater than it typically was in 2000 and regionally HTF is projected to occur: \u2022 8 days along the Northeast Atlantic (140% increase since 2000) \u2022 5 days along the Southeast (190% increase over 2000) \u2022 3 days along the Eastern Gulf (100% increase since 2000) \u2022 6 days along the Western Gulf (130% increase since 2000) \u2022 2 days along the Southwest Pacific (80% increase since 2000) \u2022 6 days along the Northwest Pacific (20% increase since 2000) Annual flood records are expected to be broken again next year and for years and decades to come. Projecting out to 2030 and 2050 provides vital information for communities who are already taking adaptation steps to address coastal flooding impacts and those who are beginning to assess future flood risk in their communities. Bounded by a range of RSL rise under a lower and continued-high emission rate, today's national HTF frequency of 5 days (national median) is likely to increase to about 7-15 days by 2030 and 25-75 days by 2050 (HTF range: low emission -high emission values), with much higher rates in many locations."}]
