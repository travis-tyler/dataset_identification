Participants were included if clinical and cognitive assessments, amyloid imaging, and APOE genotype were all available from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database (CN = 324, MCI = 502, AD = 182). Individuals with one or two copies of \u03b54 were designated as APOE \u03b54 carriers (\u03b54+); individuals with no \u03b54 were designated as APOE \u03b54 non-carriers (\u03b54\u2212). Based on mean florbetapir standard uptake value ratios, participants were classified as A\u03b2 burden-positive (A\u03b2+) or A\u03b2 burdennegative (A\u03b2\u2212). In MCI, APOE \u03b54 effects were predominantly observed on frontal executive function, with \u03b54+ participants exhibiting poorer performances; A\u03b2 positivity had no influence on this effect. A\u03b2 effects were observed on global cognition, memory, and visuospatial ability, with A\u03b2+ participants exhibiting poorer performances. Measures of frontal executive function were not influenced by A\u03b2. Interactive effects of APOE \u03b54+ and A\u03b2 were observed on global cognition and verbal recognition memory. A\u03b2, not APOE \u03b54+, influenced clinical severity and functional status. The influences of APOE \u03b54+ and A\u03b2 on cognitive function were minimal in CN and AD. In conclusion, we provide further evidence of both independent and interactive influences of APOE \u03b54+ and A\u03b2 on cognitive function in MCI, with APOE \u03b54+ and A\u03b2 showing dissociable effects on executive and non-executive functions, respectively."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive cognitive decline. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is known as an intermediate stage between healthy aging and clinical dementia. In particular, amnestic MCI (aMCI) is considered a prodromal stage of AD dementia (1-3); however, the characteristics of aMCI are both pathologically and clinically heterogeneous. Approximately 40% of individuals with MCI show very low levels of cerebral beta-amyloid (A\u03b2) deposition that are not sufficient to represent a prodromal stage of AD (4, 5) . There are various clinical phenotypes of MCI, and cognitive deficits can occur in single or multiple domains (2) .\nThe apolipoprotein E (APOE) \u03b54 allele is a major genetic risk factor for the development of late-onset AD dementia (6) . Much evidence supports the association between APOE \u03b54 and cognitive decline in non-demented individuals (7, 8) . Nevertheless, there is disagreement regarding the specific cognitive domain affected by APOE \u03b54 status. APOE \u03b54 carriers show impairments compared to non-carriers in various cognitive domains, including episodic memory (8) (9) (10) , executive function (7, 11) , language, and spatial ability (12) .\nSenile plaques containing A\u03b2 are a hallmark of AD pathology. No associations between A\u03b2 burden and cognitive function have been found in individuals with AD dementia (13, 14) . Some studies report a significant detrimental effect of A\u03b2 on memory function in non-demented individuals (14, 15) , while others find no association (16, 17) . Most studies that assess non-memory cognitive domains report non-significant effects of A\u03b2 (16) , although some studies demonstrate a significant effect (15, 17) .\nAPOE \u03b54 is involved in A\u03b2 binding and clearance during AD pathogenesis (18) ; therefore, an inextricable link between APOE \u03b54 and A\u03b2 burden likely plays a role in the process of cognitive decline in AD patients. Contradictions in previous studies mentioned above might be partially explained by a failure to consider both APOE \u03b54 status and A\u03b2 burden. Recent investigations of both factors report interactions in cross-sectional studies (15) , suggesting that APOE \u03b54 status modulates the effects of A\u03b2 on cognition. However, it is also possible that both biomarkers independently influence cognitive function. APOE \u03b54 is associated with a decline in executive function in subjects between the ages of 35 and 44 years who are unlikely to have significant A\u03b2 burdens (7) . Other studies have observed independent effects of the two factors (19, 20) . Understanding the influences of A\u03b2 burden and APOE \u03b54 on cognitive function, particularly during the MCI stage, could support early detection and intervention in AD dementia. However, it remains unclear whether these factors influence cognitive function independently or interactively and which cognitive domains are affected.\nThe majority of previous studies have evaluated APOE \u03b54-or A\u03b2-associated cognitive characteristics using brief cognitive measures. Some studies have used only the global cognitive or episodic memory tests (11, 14) or the single executive function test (7) . Executive function test was not included in some studies (19) . More comprehensive neuropsychological measures that assess multiple cognitive domains should be utilized in order to clarify the specific cognitive domains affected by APOE \u03b54 status and A\u03b2 burden. Furthermore, although cognitive function consequently influences clinical severity and everyday function, the effects of APOE \u03b54 status or A\u03b2 burden on clinical severity or functional status are rarely examined.\nWe aimed to investigate the independent and interactive influences of APOE \u03b54 status and A\u03b2 burden on multiple cognitive domains in a large group of individuals with MCI and AD, as well as cognitively normal (CN) participants. We also examined the influences of these factors on clinical severity and functional status."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "Data were collected from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu). For a detailed explanation and up-to-date information on ADNI, please see http://www.adni-info.org. We included participants from all phases of ADNI only if [18F] florbetapir positron emission tomography (PET) had been conducted within 3 months of clinical and cognitive assessment visits and APOE genotype was available. Initially, 1,030 subjects were selected. Subjects of the APOE 2/4 genotype (n = 22) were excluded due to the unclear effects of these alleles. The final analysis included 324 CN elderly participants, 502 individuals with MCI, and 182 with AD dementia who had undergone clinical evaluations and florbetapir PET scans between April 2010 and December 2013 (Table 1) . Detailed eligibility criteria for the diagnostic groups are described elsewhere (21) . Briefly, CN subjects had a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) of 0 and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores between 24 and 30, were non-depressed and non-demented, and had not been diagnosed with MCI. Subjects with MCI had a CDR of 0.5 and MMSE scores between 24 and 30, complained of objective memory loss but showed no impairment in other cognitive domains, demonstrated preserved activities of daily living, and were non-demented. AD dementia subjects had a CDR of 0.5 or 1.0 and MMSE scores between 20 (22) . Participants with any significant neurological disease other than suspected incipient AD, such as Parkinson's disease, multi-infarct dementia, Huntington's disease, normal pressure hydrocephalus, brain tumor, progressive supranuclear palsy, seizure disorders, subdural hematoma, multiple sclerosis, or a history of significant head trauma, were excluded. In addition, participants with MRI evidence of brain infection, infarction or other focal lesions, multiple lacunes, or lacunes in a critical memory structure were also excluded."}, {"section_title": "Cognitive, clinical, and functional measures", "text": "We selected cognitive testing data from ADNI participants. Four tests were selected to evaluate global cognition, including the MMSE; the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale, consisting of 11 (ADAS-cog11) and 13 items (ADAScog13); and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) (23) . We included each of these global cognitive measures in the analysis because each measure has specific characteristics and clinical usefulness. For example, a delayed recall task and number cancellation item were added to the ADAS-cog13. The MoCA was designed for MCI screening. These two measures have additional executive function and attention components compared to the MMSE and ADAS-cog11. Six measures were selected to assess memory, including the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) trials 1-5 total recall as immediate recall (RAVLT_imm), 30-minute delayed recall (RAVLT_delayed), and yes-no recognition (RAVLT_recog); Logical Memory immediate recall (LM_imm) and 30-minute delayed recall (LM_delayed) from the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised; and the ADNI composite scores for memory (ADNI_Mem) (24) . Four measures were selected to assess frontal executive function, including the Trail Making Test (TMT) parts A and B, Animal fluency, and ADNI composite scores for executive functioning (ADNI_EF) (25) . The Boston Naming Test (BNT) was included as a measure of language. Clock drawing and copying tests were included to assess visuospatial ability.\nWe selected the CDR Sum of Boxes (CDR-SOB) score as a clinical measure. This scale is a useful tool for staging clinical severity. It evaluates six domains of cognitive and daily functioning, with possible scores ranging from 0 to 18. We included the Functional Assessment Questionnaire (FAQ) to assess everyday functioning. This tool assesses instrumental activities of daily living, with scores ranging from 0 to 30, and is useful for distinguishing MCI from very mild AD as well as for monitoring functional changes (26) .\nAPOE genotyping APOE genotyping was performed at the time of participant enrollment in the ADNI study. APOE genotypes were determined using standard polymerase chain reaction methods, which have been described previously (27) . Individuals with one or two copies of allele 4 were designated as APOE \u03b54 carriers (\u03b54+); individuals with no allele 4 were designated as APOE \u03b54 non-carriers (\u03b54\u2212)."}, {"section_title": "Florbetapir PET", "text": "We obtained the mean florbetapir standard uptake value ratio (SUVR) for each participant from the ADNI database.

Briefly, the subject's first florbetapir image was coregistered to their MR image and segmented into cortical regions (frontal, anterior/posterior cingulate, lateral parietal, and lateral temporal) using FreeSurfer (version 4.5.0). The mean florbetapir uptake from these gray matter regions was then extracted and normalized to uptake in the whole cerebellum. Participants were classified as A\u03b2 burdenpositive (A\u03b2+) or A\u03b2 burden-negative (A\u03b2\u2212) according to the SUVR cutoff of 1.11 for amyloid positivity (14) ."}, {"section_title": "Statistical analysis", "text": "Demographic and clinical data were compared between study groups using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and \u03c7 2 tests for continuous and categorical variables, respectively.

To determine the main effects and interactive effects of APOE \u03b54 and A\u03b2 burden on these scores, a series of 2 \u00d7 2 ANCOVAs was performed. We corrected P values for multiple comparisons using false discovery rate (FDR) correction. Post hoc pairwise comparisons were performed using a general linear model.

The significant main effect of APOE \u03b54 status on LM_imm test scores (F [1, 317] = 6.84, FDR-corrected P < 0.001) indicated poorer performances by \u03b54+ compared to \u03b54\u2212 participants.\nThere were significant main effects of APOE \u03b54 status on scores on all measures of frontal executive function in the MCI group (Table 2) . ADNI_EF scores were lower in \u03b54+ compared to \u03b54\u2212 participants. Significant main effects of APOE \u03b54 status were also observed on ADNI_Mem, LM_delayed, ADAS-cog13, and MoCA scores.

The magnitudes of the differences between \u03b54+ and \u03b54\u2212 participants, averaged for A\u03b2 positivity, indicated that \u03b54+ participants showed poorer performances compared to \u03b54\u2212 participants on all measures of frontal executive function and on several measures of global cognitive and memory (Fig. 1 ). There were significant main effects of A\u03b2 positivity on all tests of global cognition, memory, and visuospatial ability. Conversely, none of the measures of frontal executive function or language showed A\u03b2-related effects. The magnitude of the differences between A\u03b2+ and A\u03b2\u2212 participants, averaged for APOE \u03b54 status, indicated that A\u03b2+ participants showed poorer performances on global cognition, memory, and visuospatial tests compared to A\u03b2\u2212 participants (Fig. 1) .

First, both APOE \u03b54 status and A\u03b2 positivity independently influenced cognitive function in participants with MCI. Specifically, there were \u03b54-related performance impairments in frontal executive function tests and other tests with frontal executive components. There were A\u03b2-related performance impairments in global cognition, memory, and visuospatial tests, but not in tests of frontal executive function. Second, there were interactive effects of the two factors on global cognition and verbal recognition memory in the MCI group, with \u03b54+A\u03b2+ participants exhibiting the most significant impairments. Third, A\u03b2 positivity, but not APOE \u03b54 status, influenced clinical severity and functional status in the MCI group. Lastly, the influences of APOE \u03b54 status and A\u03b2 positivity on cognitive function, clinical severity, and functional status were minimal in the CN and AD dementia groups.\nInterestingly, there were dissociable influences of APOE \u03b54 status and A\u03b2 positivity on cognitive performances in the MCI group. APOE \u03b54 status predominantly influenced scores on frontal executive function tests and other measures with frontal executive components (i.e., the ADAS-cog13, MoCA, and delayed free recall task). A\u03b2 positivity had no significant influence on these effects. These results suggest that the contribution of APOE \u03b54 to AD pathogenesis may be partially independent of its role in A\u03b2 pathology. Furthermore, the predominantly affected cognitive domain may be frontal executive function. The frontal lobe is the neural substrate for executive function. A systemic review and meta-analysis study previously revealed a robust APOE \u03b54-related decrease in frontal lobe metabolism in non-demented subjects (28) . Additionally, Chu et al. (11) recently reported that non-demented APOE \u03b54 carriers showed impaired performances on frontal executive function measures, but not on memory tests. Previous reports assessing APOE \u03b54-related cognitive characteristics are inconsistent (29) . The discrepancy among previous investigations may be attributable, at least in part, to failure to control for A\u03b2 burden in their analyses. It is likely that A\u03b2 burden is a confounding factor when assessing the relationship between APOE \u03b54 status and cognitive function, particularly in the elderly population. A\u03b2 deposition linearly increases with age, with a high number of A\u03b2+ individuals aged 60 and older (17) . In agreement with this result, APOE \u03b54 status affects performance on executive function tasks and frontal lobe thickness in younger subjects, in whom the accumulation of A\u03b2 is unlikely to be a factor (7, 30) .\nWe found significant main effects of A\u03b2 positivity on global cognition, memory, and visuospatial ability in participants with MCI, with A\u03b2+ individuals exhibiting poorer performances. However, measures of frontal executive function were not influenced by A\u03b2 positivity. Although there are conflicting investigations assessing the effects of A\u03b2 positivity (31, 32) , our results are consistent with observations that high A\u03b2 burden is associated with poor cognitive function in subjects with MCI (14) . Non-significant associations between A\u03b2 positivity and frontal executive function are rarely reported; the majority of previous studies have mainly focused on episodic memory and lack detailed tests of frontal executive function (14, 33) . Thus, the influence of A\u03b2 burden on frontal executive function has not been thoroughly examined. Consistent with our results, one recent follow-up study using comprehensive neuropsychological measures demonstrated that A\u03b2 positivity did not affect frontal executive function in subjects with MCI but was associated with declines in other cognitive domains (20) . Our subgroup analyses of representative scores on frontal executive function and memory tests showed that APOE \u03b54 status and A\u03b2 positivity predominantly affected frontal executive function and memory, respectively. These dissociable influences of APOE \u03b54 status and A\u03b2 positivity on executive and non-executive cognitive functions, respectively, in subjects with MCI could provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying AD-related cognitive decline.\nWe also found interactive effects of APOE \u03b54 status and A\u03b2 positivity on measures of global cognition and verbal recognition memory in the MCI group. Individuals positive for both APOE \u03b54 and A\u03b2 exhibited the most significant impairments in these tests, whereas no differences were found between individuals positive for only one of these factors. This result is in line with a previous study showing that the combination of APOE \u03b54+ status and A\u03b2 burden is a significant risk factor for AD, though their independent effects may not be sufficient to cause AD (34) . Our results suggest that the combination of APOE \u03b54+ genotype and A\u03b2 burden is associated with greater detrimental effects on cognition than each single factor.\nIn the current study, the influences of APOE \u03b54 status and A\u03b2 positivity on cognitive characteristics were minimal in the CN group. APOE \u03b54 influenced verbal immediate story recall; CN \u03b54+ subjects exhibited significantly lower performances compared to CN \u03b54\u2212 participants. Furthermore, A\u03b2 positivity did not influence this effect. This result is consistent with previous studies showing adverse APOE \u03b54 effects on verbal memory in a healthy normal elderly population, particularly in an episodic learning procedure similar to the test used in this study (8, 35) . Our findings also suggest that episodic memory, as measured by story recall, can be a sensitive tool to detect APOE \u03b54-related memory problems in the healthy normal elderly population. A meta-analysis of 77 studies reported that \u03b54+ individuals showed small but significant adverse effects not only on episodic memory, but also on global cognition, executive function, and perceptual speed (29) . This discrepancy may be related to differences in study samples. Participants with MCI were not excluded in many of the studies included in the meta-analysis [e.g., (36) ]. Although the meta-analysis included studies of cognitively intact subjects, it is likely that a considerable proportion of participants with MCI were also included. In contrast, MCI was not included in our CN group. We did not find any effect of A\u03b2 positivity on cognitive performance. The relationship between A\u03b2 burden and cognition in the healthy normal elderly is generally weak or absent (19, 31) . However, a recent meta-analysis investigating the relationship between A\u03b2 and cognition reported that A\u03b2 burden, as examined by amyloid imaging, was negatively associated with episodic memory (37) . One possible reason for this discrepancy could be the study design (cross-sectional or longitudinal). The meta-analysis performed by Hedden et al. (37) included both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses, whereas the current study is a cross-sectional analysis. Effects of A\u03b2 accumulation may be more apparent in longitudinal studies of cognitive decline rather than cross-sectional studies. A longitudinal study showed that, while effects of A\u03b2 on cognitive function were insignificant in baseline evaluations, A\u03b2 accumulation was significantly associated with declines in episodic memory after 18 months (19) .\nNeither APOE \u03b54 status nor A\u03b2 positivity influenced any cognitive measures in the AD dementia group. A lack of association between A\u03b2 burden and cognition in AD dementia patients has been consistently reported (13, 31) . This implies that A\u03b2 deposition is an early event that has plateaued at the point of clinical diagnosis of AD dementia (38) . In line with previous studies (39, 40) , we failed to find APOE \u03b54-related differences in cognitive function in the AD dementia group. However, one study has demonstrated an APOE \u03b54-associated effect on memory and frontal executive function in AD dementia (10) . The age of the participants may contribute to this inconsistency; Chang et al. (39) have hypothesized that the effect of APOE \u03b54 on cognition may differ according to the mean age of the population being studied. Effects on cognitive function have been observed in elderly patients less than 75 years of age (10), whereas no significant effects have been found in studies of elderly patients over 80 years of age (39) or in our study, which included a wide range of ages (55 to 94 years).\nWe did not find any associations of APOE \u03b54 status or A\u03b2 positivity with clinical or functional status in the CN and AD dementia groups. However, A\u03b2 positivity, but not APOE \u03b54 status, was associated with poorer clinical and functional status in the MCI group, suggesting that a greater A\u03b2 burden negatively influences both clinical severity and everyday functioning.\nWe propose several possible explanations for the strong effects of APOE \u03b54 and A\u03b2 burden observed only in the MCI group. First and most importantly, AD dementia has a very long preclinical period. APOE \u03b54 and A\u03b2 accumulation may negatively influence cognitive function during the prodromal stage (i.e., the MCI stage); however these effects may lessen during the clinical stage of AD dementia. Second, cognitive function in the MCI group was more heterogeneous than in the CN or AD dementia groups. CN subjects showed no cognitive impairments, raising the possibility of ceiling effects, whereas participants with AD showed significant cognitive impairments that may have been susceptible to floor effects. Third, the distribution of APOE \u03b54 status and A\u03b2 positivity within each group could influence the results. The CN and AD dementia groups included high percentages of \u03b54\u2212A\u03b2\u2212 (56%) and \u03b54+A\u03b2+ individuals (64%), respectively, whereas the MCI group showed a relatively even distribution in the cells of positive or negative for both factors. Therefore, there may be insufficient variance between the two factors and cognitive scores to detect any effects in the CN and AD groups.\nSome limitations and future directions should be discussed.\nFirst, this study had a cross-sectional design, precluding an investigation of the effects of APOE \u03b54 and A\u03b2 on longitudinal cognitive decline in this population. To clarify the independent effects of these two factors, this issue should be addressed through further assessment of APOE \u03b54-or A\u03b2 burden-related cognitive changes, particularly in the CN group. Second, cognitive performance is closely related to brain function and structure; however, dissociable influences of APOE \u03b54 and A\u03b2 burden on brain function were not examined in the current study. Future neuroimaging studies are needed to verify our results and to understand the precise role of the APOE gene in frontal executive function. Third, AD dementia diagnosis is made on a clinical rather than a pathological basis. Although the proportion of A\u03b2\u2212 AD dementia patients was small (16%), we cannot entirely exclude the possibility that participants with non-AD dementia were included in our study.\nIn conclusion, we provide further evidence that APOE \u03b54 and A\u03b2 burden play both independent and interactive roles in altering cognitive function in individuals with MCI. Dissociable, independent influences of APOE \u03b54 and A\u03b2 burden on executive and non-executive cognitive functions, respectively, were found in participants with MCI. Interactive effects of these two factors on global cognition and recognition memory were also observed. "}, {"section_title": "DISCLOSURE", "text": ""}]
