[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract Previous studies of Ab plasma as a biomarker for Alzheimer's disease (AD) obtained conflicting results. We here included 715 subjects with baseline Ab 1-40 and Ab 1-42 plasma measurement (50% with 4 serial annual measurements): 205 cognitively normal controls (CN), 348 patients mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 162 with AD. We assessed the factors that modified their concentrations and correlated these values with PIB PET, MRI and tau and Ab 1-42 measures in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Association between Ab and diagnosis (baseline and prospective) was assessed. A number of health conditions were associated with altered concentrations of plasma Ab. The effect of age differed according to AD stage. Plasma Ab 1-42 showed mild correlation with other biomarkers of Ab pathology and were associated with infarctions in MRI. Longitudinal measurements of Ab 1-40 and Ab 1-42 plasma levels showed modest value as a prognostic factor for clinical progression. Our longitudinal study of complementary measures of Ab pathology (PIB, CSF and plasma Ab) and other biomarkers in a cohort with an extensive neuropsychological battery is significant because it shows that plasma Ab measurements have limited value for For the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative: Data used here were produced by the ADNI Biomarker Core or obtained from the ADNI database (www.loni.ucla.edu/ADNI).

These findings, coupled with other data, led to the amyloid cascade hypothesis and thus to the development of biomarkers to measure Ab pathology including Ab imaging and measurements of Ab peptides in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma [22, 49] . In turn, biomarkers have advanced our understanding of the temporal profile of the pathophysiological events that occur during the progression of AD [24] . For example, measurement of CSF Ab has been shown to be accurate and informative diagnostically for distinguishing cognitively normal subjects from AD subjects [49] , predicting conversion of MCI subjects [10, 50] and in the differential diagnosis with frontotemporal degeneration [11] . CSF Ab values also show a strong negative correlation with Pittsburgh Compound B (PIB) PET values [13, 14, 57] . But there is a compelling need for minimally invasive plasma biomarkers [1] .\nHowever, studies of plasma Ab have been contradictory and cross-sectional analyses have reported higher Ab levels [36] [37] [38] , higher Ab [36] , lower levels of Ab [31, 34] as well as lower Ab 1-42/1-40 ratio (AbR) values [5, 31, 34] in AD patients. Further, when other studies adjusted for different factors, they only found a mild effect of baseline Ab 1-40 as a predictor for developing MCI, while the other associations with plasma Ab disappeared after multivariate adjustment [17, 33, 54] .\nIn cohort studies, baseline higher Ab concentration [8, 52, 55] , higher levels of Ab [8, 30, 36, 37, 46] , high AbR [36, 37] or low AbR [20, 28, 55, 59] were associated with risk for AD [36] . Studies that measured plasma Ab concentrations at two time points in cohort studies report that a decrease of plasma Ab [8, 37, [46] [47] [48] and a decrease of the AbR [46] [47] [48] were associated with progression to AD or with cognitive decline. Two studies measured plasma Ab levels at several time intervals but did not describe the temporal profile of changes in their concentrations [32, 47, 48] .\nPlasma Ab concentrations have also been linked to vascular brain pathology in the case of Ab40 [21] and in longitudinal studies of plasma Ab concentrations were related to progression to mixed and vascular dementia [28] and hypertension [29] .\nFactors that lead to the discrepancies in the literature on the diagnostic and prognostic utility of measuring plasma Ab are not well understood, but could reflect many clinical and methodological factors that affect plasma levels [3, 4, 9, 37] , while age may act as a confounding factor [17, 20, 33, 52] (plasma Ab concentrations could have different values at different stages of disease).\nTo address all these conflicting results, we analyzed different factors affecting Ab concentration in order to be able to adjust the statistical models used to test the considered hypotheses. The relationship of the Ab burden measured by biomarkers in different biological compartments was tested. We then tested the association with cerebrovascular lesions and vascular risk factors followed by testing the utility for baseline classification. Finally, we tested the longitudinal changes of Ab plasma concentrations across time at different stages of the disease and the utility of Ab plasma as a prognostic factor in AD."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects", "text": "The ADNI is a multicenter longitudinal neuroimaging study, launched in 2004 by the National Institute on Aging, the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering, the Food and Drug Administration, private pharmaceutical companies and non-profit organizations. ADNI includes 819 adult subjects, 55-90 years old, who meet entry criteria for a clinical diagnosis of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI), probable AD or cognitively normal (CN), who are prospectively followed, gathering clinical information, neuroimaging studies and biological samples for molecular biomarker measurement as previously described [23, 25, 39, 49] (for more details, see http://www.adni-info.org/index and supplementary material). We further classified subjects as stable if they did not change their diagnostic category from CN to MCI/AD or from MCI to AD, having a follow-up of at least 36 months. Patients who progressed were classified as CN progressors and MCI progressors.\nPlasma and CSF Ab and Ab Plasma concentrations of Ab and Ab were measured using Module A of the INNO-BIA plasma Ab forms immunoassay kit (Innogenetics, Ghent, Belgium, for research use-only reagents) on the Luminex 100 immunoassay platform and IS v.2.3 software (Luminex, Austin, TX, USA) using a fully automated sample preparation approach and lowest calibrator concentrations of 3.75 pg/mL and 1.25 pg/mL for Ab and Ab , respectively (Figurski et al., manuscript in preparation) and other operating conditions as previously described [5, 27] . The same reagents were used for all samples. The inter-assay %CV obtained from daily measurement of aliquots prepared from two human subject plasma samples was 4.1% (n = 75) and 5.2% (n = 42) for Ab 1-42 and 7.0 and 5.5% for Ab . After each of 75 analytical runs, 2-3 samples were randomly selected for re-testing of a second never previously thawed aliquot. The average %CV obtained for 195 testretest pairs was: 4.5%CV for Ab 1-42 and 7.2%CV for Ab . The qualification of this assay has been described in studies by Vanderstichele, Shaw and colleagues and the data are available at http://www.adni-info.org/index.\nDetails of the CSF collection, measurements and the formula to classify subjects by normal and pathological CSF signature can be found in Shaw et al. [49] .\nPittsburgh Compound B PET imaging ADNI PIB PET studies were performed at 14 different sites, where the production and radiolabeling of PIB were performed as outlined previously by Mathis et al. [35] . The ADNI PIB PET images undergo several quality control and standardization steps. Regional assessment of the PIB-PET data involves sampling 13 different brain areas using an automated region of interest (ROI) template method and standardized uptake value ratios were calculated as reviewed in Jagust et al. [25] , using a cerebellar gray matter reference region. A PIB retention summary measure was formed by combining anterior cingulate cortex, lateral temporal cortex, precuneus, parietal and frontal cortex ROI values for each subject.\nMRI and white matter hyperintensity volume Acquisition of 1.5-T MRI data at each performance site followed a previously described standardized protocol that was rigorously validated across sites [23] . Then, for each fast-spin echo scan, the proton density and T2 images were linearly combined to form a ''pseudo-T1'', which was aligned to the T1 scan and non-brain tissues were removed from the T1 scan. White matter hyperintensities (WMH) were detected in minimum deformation template space at each voxel based on corresponding PD, T1, and T2 intensities, the prior probability of WMH, and the conditional probability of WMH based on the presence of WMH at neighboring voxels. The resulting map of WMH voxels across the brain is summarized by an estimate of total WMH volume (WMHV) [7] . Infarctions were ascertained through qualitative review by experts in Helen Wills Institute on the PD/T2 images."}, {"section_title": "Cognitive testing", "text": "Neuropsychological evaluation and criteria for the clinical diagnosis of MCI and AD have been described [39] .

For comparisons of normally distributed numerical variables, a t test or ANOVA was used. In the absence of a normal distribution, log transformation was applied (individual Ab measures were normally distributed but the ratio was log transformed), but if this failed to normalize the data, the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test was applied. Variables with a p value lower than 0.20 were selected to enter a forward stepwise selection multivariate regression model. For correlations between biomarker levels Pearson r coefficients were calculated (r P ), but in the presence of bivariate outliers in the relplot representation [18] a percentage bend correlation (r PB ) was used. For dependent categorical variables binary logistic regression models were applied. ROC curves and their respective area under the curve (AUC) were estimated using values predicted by the logistic regression. To assess MCI conversion to AD, Cox proportional hazards models were used. For repeated measures analysis of quantitative variables, mixed-effect models were applied. The obtained p values were corrected for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni's method.\nZ-scores were obtained calculating an a-winsorized mean and standard deviation (SD) (a = 0.10). We obtained an averaged z-score for five cognitive domains (learning and delayed verbal memory, language, executive function and processing) using the baseline scores of the 167 subjects who continued to be classified as CN at the third year follow-up, and a global composite cognitive measure was obtained averaging these domains. The mean and SD for Ab plasma levels were obtained using the baseline values of CN subjects with normal CSF signature. A change in Ab measures was classified as a decrease or increase if at 36 months there was a decrease greater than 0.5 SD or an increase greater than 0.5 SD. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 19.0 and R 2.12.1 [40, 58] ."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "We included 715 subjects who had a baseline Ab measurement, whose follow-up information is presented in Fig. 1 and whose characteristics are summarized in Table 1 ."}, {"section_title": "Factors affecting Ab plasma concentration", "text": "Increased concentrations of baseline plasma Ab and Ab 1-40 were associated with increasing age, low levels of total proteins, decreasing platelet count, impaired kidney function and with gender (males [ females), while Ab 1-40 levels decreased with increasing cholesterol levels. Ab decreased with increasing copies of APOE4 allele. However, Ab 1-42 /Ab 1-40 ratio values were only affected by glucose (Table 2) .\nAge, platelet count, total protein and creatinine concentration were independent predictors for Ab and Ab and explained 12.1 and 12.9% of the variability of their respective concentrations. These variables were included in the multivariate models to adjust for possible confounders.\nAb levels measured in plasma and CSF and the PIB Ab burden in brain Correlation between Ab 1-40 and Ab 1-42 plasma concentrations was 0.834 (p \\ 0.001), while the correlation between Ab 1-42 in plasma and CSF in the 368 available subjects was low (r PB = 0.155, p = 0.017). Adjusting for factors affecting Ab 1-42 plasma levels did not improve the ability to predict CSF Ab values. There was a mild inverse correlation between Ab 1-42 plasma and CSF tau (r PB = -0.143, p = 0.037) and p-tau p181 (r PB = -0.171, p = 0.006) ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). Similar results were obtained for the following groups: CN and MCI with normal CSF and MCI stable, MCI progressors and AD with pathological CSF.\nNinety-five subjects had at least one PIB and plasma Ab measures and 44 subjects had Ab 1-42 CSF and PIB measures obtained at the same follow-up visit. Mean PIB values showed a high inverse correlation with CSF Ab 1-42 levels (r P = -0.759, p \\ 0.001), a mild inverse correlation with Ab 1-42 plasma levels (r PB = -0.234, p = 0.044) and no correlation with plasma Ab (Fig. 2) .\nAb plasma levels, vascular risk factors and WMHV There was no correlation between WMHV and plasma Ab (r PB = 0.069, p = 0.17) and Ab (r PB = 0.083, p = 0.82). We adjusted in a multiple regression model with concentration. There was no correlation between the three plasma Ab measurements and the studied vascular risk factors (BMI, systolic and diastolic blood pressure). Plasma Ab 1-42 levels, adjusted for age and BMI, predicted if a subject was or was not hypertensive (p = 0.03), however the AUC of the model was 0.639.\nBaseline plasma Ab levels, changes in cognitive status and CSF tau and Ab levels There were no differences in plasma Ab measures comparing CN stable, MCI stable, MCI progressors and AD. We then compared in a two factor ANOVA, adjusting for age groups (split by median age, 75 years) and the following diagnostic categories based on CSF signature: CN stable with normal CSF (n = 71), MCI stable with normal (n = 42) and pathological CSF (n = 32), and MCI progressors (n = 58) and AD cases with pathological CSF (n = 86). In this model, there were no differences based on diagnostic categories (p = 0.333) but the term for age (p = 0.003) as well as the interaction between diagnostic category and age (p = 0.018) was significant in the ANOVA studying Ab (Fig. 3) . The latter was only significant in the groups with pathological CSF signature. The results for Ab were similar, with an interaction between age and diagnostic group (p = 0.015), that was only significant in both MCI groups with a pathological CSF signature. When studying AbR, there was neither a difference between the diagnostic groups (p = 0.234), nor an interaction between the diagnostic groups and age groups (p = 0.249)."}, {"section_title": "Longitudinal analysis of Ab plasma levels", "text": "For the analysis of the temporal profile of changes in Ab plasma levels, we studied the following groups: CN stable subjects with normal CSF (n = 71), MCI stable subjects (n = 31) and MCI progressors with pathological CSF (n = 35). In the mixed-effect models studying Ab 1-40 and Ab 1-42 plasma measures there was a statistically significant effect of time, with values increasing in the successive follow-ups and a difference between groups in the Ab 1-42 model (Fig. 4) . The AbR decreased along time and there was no difference between diagnostic groups. AD subjects could only be studied up to 2-year follow-up. There was no difference between baseline and 24-month follow-up in the AD group. Fig. 4 Amyloid beta (Ab) plasma biomarker changes along time in cognitive normal subjects with normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), mild cognitive impairment stable and progressor subjects with pathological CSF and Alzheimer's disease (AD) subjects with pathological CSF with 95% CI based on SE. All the models were adjusted for age and took into consideration the interaction between age and diagnostic category. Utility of Ab plasma measure to predict cognitive decline\nWe calculated tertiles of baseline Ab plasma measures in the CN group. None of the three plasma Ab measurements classified according to the previously described tertiles showed an increased risk for conversion from MCI to AD in the adjusted Cox proportional hazards models (p Ab1-40 = 0.633, p Ab1-42 = 1.0, p AbR = 1.0). On the other hand, a pathological CSF signature heralded a higher risk of conversion [HR 2.12 (95%CI 1.20-3.75)], as previously reported. The percentage of dropouts with a follow-up of 36 months was 23.6%. Results were similar with a followup of 24 months and 13.8% of dropouts. We further studied the cognitive evolution of our sample in a mixed-effect model that included age at baseline, re-AMNART, the different annual visits, Ab tertiles at baseline and the following diagnostic categories: CN stable with normal CSF and MCI stable and MCI progressors with a pathological CSF signature. None of the Ab plasma measures had a statistical effect on change in the composite cognitive measure. However, there was a significant interaction between re-AMNART and Ab 1-42 tertiles (Fig. 5) . When analyzing the different cognitive domains, the interaction was present in the language and executive domains (Table 3) . Subjects with highest re-AMNART and in the lowest Ab42 tertile had worse cognitive performance than those in the highest Ab42 tertile and highest re-AMNART. The interaction was not significant when using the years of education. But education did not predict cognitive scores in two of the models and the association was milder in the model with general cognition (p = 0.031).\nWe then studied the previous statistically significant models in the whole sample without classifying subjects according to their CSF signature. There was no effect on Ab 1-42 tertiles or an interaction of Ab tertiles and re-AMNART in any of the models.\nFinally, in a mixed-effect model with CN stable (n = 168) and all MCI (n = 276) subjects, there was no interaction between re-AMNART and the Ab categories, but patients who had an increase in AbR (p = 0.027) or a decrease of Ab (p = 0.045) had worse performance on the composite cognitive measure, without a significant effect of the change of Ab (p = 0.778; Fig. 5 )."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In our study we confirmed the poor performance of measuring plasma Ab levels for classification at different stages of AD in cross-sectional analyses, but we found a different trends in the repeated plasma measurements with levels being stable in the AD group. Thus, it is possible that longitudinal measures of plasma Ab could be informative as a biomarker for the response to Ab therapies or as an indicator of increased risk for conversion from normal or MCI to AD. We also quantified systemic factors that account for 12-13% of the variability of plasma levels. Finally, we confirmed the interaction between cognitive reserve and Ab plasma measurements, finding an effect in the executive and language domains, and described a new association with infarctions.\nThe results of this study show that patients with infarctions documented by MRI have higher Ab 1-42 levels than subjects without such lesions, and there was a trend for an association between WMHV and Ab 1-42 plasma. In addition to the well-described association between renal function and plasma Ab [3, 36] , we also found that total proteins and platelets affected plasma Ab levels as suggested earlier for blood levels [9] . Plasma Ab and Ab concentrations were associated with aging, but this association was only present in MCI subjects with a pathological CSF signature who showed increasing levels with increasing age. When repeated measures of plasma Ab and Ab 1-42 were analyzed, there was an increase in both biomarker concentrations with time in the three studied groups although levels were lower in MCI patients with a pathological CSF signature. AbR decreased with time and the ratio was lower in MCI patients with pathological CSF. Concentration did not change in the AD group which would favor the hypothesis that levels stay stable or decrease in advanced stages of the disease. We found that in early stages a decrease in Ab and an increase in AbR were associated with a worse cognitive performance. Subjects with lower cognitive reserve, who had lower Ab 1-42 plasma concentrations at baseline scored worse on cognitive testing, indicating that they may only exert a mild effect that is counteracted by cognitive reserve as reported recently [59] . In our study, we had a cognitive battery which allowed us to study different domains, finding that the effects were driven by the executive and language domain. Results for years of education were negative. We think that this is due to the skewed representation of mainly highly educated subjects that precludes a wide range and normal distribution of values. Ab plasma levels had a better correlation with Ab amyloid brain deposits than with CSF Ab values across all the studied groups, thereby confirming previous results [12, 13, 34] . We did not find a significant association between vascular risk factors and Ab plasma levels.\nOur results are consistent with the idea that the conflicting results of previous studies can, in part, be caused by age and disease stage effects on plasma Ab concentrations as these factors differed across the studies. Our data also underline the importance of having well-defined subjects and the use of biomarkers that recognize the underlying pathology in AD (i.e. CSF tau and Ab biomarkers) to evaluate the utility of other potential AD biomarkers (i.e. plasma Ab) in the absence of neuropathological diagnosis. Our results show that given our current understanding Ab plasma levels, they are not useful for cross-sectional classification purposes in agreement with a recent metanalysis [51] . Although our study did not find a prognostic utility studies with longer follow-up periods and their joined results have shown predictive value [15, 46, 51] . Thus, it is plausible that measures of plasma Ab within subjects over periods of greater duration could become simple and minimally invasive screens to identify individuals at increased risk for AD dementia. Notably, our study provides insight into factors that affect Ab plasma levels and better understanding of these factors will be critical if we are to be able to exploit measures of plasma Ab as a screening assay along the lines described above. Indeed plasma Ab levels increase with aging, but changes in plasma Ab are more stable as AD progresses to more advanced stages of disease.\nOne of the major strengths of our study is that it combines imaging, CSF and plasma Ab data from the same cohort, i.e. ADNI subjects, and our study included an analysis of the data according to underlying AD neuropathology (assessed with CSF tau and Ab signature of AD) with a comprehensive neuropsychological battery to assess the effects of plasma levels of Ab on different cognitive domains.\nOur study also has some weaknesses. The inclusion criteria excluded subjects with important vascular pathology, so our results on vascular risk factors and vascular dementia are to be taken cautiously. The selection criteria used in the ADNI study were designed to enroll late MCI subjects, and this has been confirmed by the high progression rate to AD, and therefore we may not have captured important plasma Ab changes that could have occurred in earlier stages of the disease. Last, the follow-up and biomarker sampling were not complete in AD cases and we did not have available data for the whole cohort which decreases the statistical power. These weaknesses notwithstanding, our study advances understanding of the significance of plasma Ab measurements in normal aging, MCI and AD. "}]
