For closer examination of Guiso et al. (2008) , restricting the sample to immigrant allows us to reduce the possibility of reverse causality. Key findings obtained through regression estimation are: (1) decreased gender wage gap leads to girls exhibiting a reduced incidence of lateness and skipping school compared with boys, which in turn improves girls' test scores in mathematics, science, and reading; (2) the direct effect of the decreased wage gap on test scores exceeds its indirect effect on performance owing to influencing school attendance. Considering the direct and indirect effects of the wage gap: each 1% decrease in the wage gap results in a 0.20%, 0.13% or 0.06% increase in test scores for mathematics, science, and reading, respectively."}, {"section_title": "I. Introduction", "text": "The gender wage gap is a critical issue for both academic researchers and policy makers to consider (World Economic Forum 2011) . The gender wage gap is widely observed and so has been formally studied (Bartolucci 2013) . One potential explanation for the gender wage gap is that it might reflect differences in cognitive skills. In fact, a gender gap exists in educational achievement, for example as measured by school test scores (e.g., Dee 2007; Goldin et al. 2008; Cornwell et al. 2013; Stoet and Geary 2013; Fortin et al., 2015) . Graduates with higher test scores in mathematics are observed to attain a higher educational level and earn higher income than others (e.g., Altonji 1995; Levine and Zimmerman 1995; Rose and Betts 2004; Joensen and Nielsen 2009 ). Girls' scores in mathematics are also observed to be lower than those of boys (Guiso et al., 2008; Fryer and Levitt 2010; Stoet and Geary 2013) . Relative lack of mathematical skills among girls is thought to be one of the factors supporting the gender wage gap.\nEconomic incentives are thought to play an important role in learning and hence in improving cognitive skills 1 . Many researchers have attempted to empirically examine the economic incentives associated with educational achievement (Angrist and Lavy 2009; Kremer et al. 2009; Leuven et al. 2010; Fryer 2011; Bettinger 2012; Angrist et al. 2014 ). Increasing numbers of researchers have focused on the gender gap in mathematics and its relationship with empirical economics (e.g., Ellison and Swanson 2010; Guiso et al. 2008; Fryer and Levitt 2010; Niederle and Versterlund 2010) .\nExisting studies used PISA data to consider the effects of social conditions on the gender gap in mathematics test scores (Guiso et al. 2008; Fryer and Levitt 2010;  Stoet and Geary 2013) 2 . However, the key variable used in these papers was the Gender Gap Index (GGI) sourced from the World Economic Forum's Global Gender Index (WEF-GGI). The GGI comprises various gender gaps, such as economic, political empowerment, health status and so on. Therefore, these studies did not scrutinize whether economic conditions influenced the gender gap in test scores by creating an incentive to learn. From the viewpoint of economics, it is valuable to specifically investigate the economic gender gap that relates to girls' incentives to study. Adult females are a role model for female students, and can motivate girls to study and otherwise influence their behavior (Neumark and Gardecki 1998; Bettinger and Long 2005) . Female students have a particular incentive to learn and improve their test scores when academic achievement is positively related to wage level. When motivated by the expectation of higher female wage levels in future, female students make more effort to learn during class. Therefore, girls' test scores vary with adult female wage levels even given identical time spent learning at school. Furthermore, an expectation of higher female wages in future means that female students have a motivation to regularly attend school and that their parents have a motivation to direct their daughters to attend school.\nThis, in turn, improves test score.\nTo explore the channels through which female students can improve their test scores, this paper investigates both the direct effect of gender wage gap on test scores and the indirect effect it exerts through influencing school attendance. The direct effect can be considered to involve quality of classroom learning, while the indirect effect can be considered to involve quantity of learning time at school. Further, the samples of existing works have included fewer than 50 countries (Guiso et al. 2008; Fryer and Levitt 2010) . However, the number of countries included in PISA 2012 increased and so 62 countries are used for estimation in this study. This improves the accuracy of the estimation results. Existing studies consider the influence of social conditions on test scores in mathematics and reading (Fryer and Levitt 2010; Stoet and Geary 2013 data to examine the association of the gender gap with academic test score. In previous works (Guiso et al. 2008; Fryer and Levitt 2010) national average PISA data are matched with WEF-GGI data. In contrast, in this paper, individual level PISA data are matched with country level WEF-GGI data, which allows controlling for individual level characteristics of students. As is exhibited in Table A1 , among 68 countries, 63 are used for estimations because WEF-GGI data cannot be obtained for five countries. In comparison with PISA 2003, which provided the data for previous works (Guiso et al. 2008; Fryer and Levitt 2010) , the number of countries participating in PISA 2012 increased to 68 (PISA 2012), from 41 previously. Fryer and Levitt (2010) argued that estimation results changed when the sample was restricted to that of \"TIMSS (Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study)-PISA overlap\". To check the robustness of the estimation results, this paper also used subsamples of countries equivalent to the \"TIMSS-PISA overlap\" samples. Reverse causality seems to exist between the gender wage gap and gender test score gap because well-educated females can find work that pays high wages. To reduce the possibility of reverse causality, this paper restricted the sample to students who were migrants from other countries because students were unlikely to have been the decision-makers regarding immigration and so the gender wage gap of their country of residence was, to a certain extent, exogenously given.\nConsequently, the sample size reduced to about 19,000 individuals in the baseline model, representing 62 countries 3 ."}, {"section_title": "III. Econometric Specification", "text": "The variables used in the regression estimations are shown in Table 1 , which indicates definitions and basic statistics (mean and standard deviation). The estimated function of the baseline model takes the following form:\nwhere Y im represents the dependent variable for individual i and country m. Y im are student's test scores (MATH, SCIE, and READ), which take the log form for convenience of interpretation. Gender difference among students and gender gap in economic status are captured by including FEMALE (female dummy) and WAGE_FM (female wage/male wage), respectively. We see from Table 1 that the mean value of WAGE_FM is 0.65, which implies that the average wage level of female adults is around 65% that of male adults. The key variable of this paper is, WAGE_FM * FEMALE (the cross term of WAGE_FM and FEMALE). If female wage increases relative to male wage, and as a result the test scores of female students increase relative to those of male students, then WAGE_FM * FEMALE has a positive sign. To control for the level of economic development in students' country of residence, log of per capita GDP is included. To consider the effect of time spent on study in school on test score, LATE and SKIP are incorporated. Time spent on class is thought to be an input for educational achievement and so to be positively associated with test score. LATE and SKIP are considered to reduce the time spent and their coefficient sign is predicted to be negative.\nEven within the group aged 15 years, the ages of individual students differ by months. PISA 2012 provides student age information not only in years but also in months, and so AGE is included. Table 1 suggested that the mean value of AGE is 15.7 years. This paper restricted the sample to students that had immigrated from other countries and so degree of assimilation is critical to academic achievement (Akresh and Redstone 2011, Nielsen and Rangvid 2012) . The timing of arrival in the country of residence is thought to reflect academic performance, especially for reading scores because reading experience increases with the time students have spent living in a given language environment. AR_AGE (age of arrival in the country of residence) is included and its expected coefficient sign is negative. As shown in Table 1 , the mean value of AR_AGE is 6.4, which is almost the starting year of primary school although the educational system differs with country. For the 2012 data, an average of 9 years had passed since the arrival of students at their country of residence from their country of birth. Concerning family characteristics, PISA 2012 provides information about WEALTH (family wealth) and so is incorporated to control for family economic status. Further, living with family members is observed to influence academic performance (Bettinger et al. 2014) \nwhere Z im represents the dependent variable LATE (or SKIP ), which is censored at 1, and so the 2009 ). If this holds, female wages increase relative to male wages, leading girls to regularly attend school to increase their probability of earning higher wages in the future. Therefore, the coefficient of WAGE_FM * FEMALE is predicted to have a negative sign in equation (2).\nConsidering the results of equations (1) and (2) to estimate the indirect effect of gender wage gap on test scores via such mechanisms as being late for school and skipping school. (1) and (2), and is statistically significant. In contrast, WAGE_FM * FEMALE shows a negative sign in column (2) variables, the coefficient of AGE is significant and positive sign in all columns. Therefore, as students mature, their test scores for all subjects improve. After controlling for student age, it is interesting to observe that AR_AGE is statistically significant at the 1% level in columns (2) and (3) but not in column (1), although the sign of AR_AGE is negative in all columns. Furthermore, the absolute value of the coefficient of AR_AGE is 0.002 for reading, which is twice its value of 0.001 for science. This implies that for each one year decrease in the age of students' arrival in their country of residence there occurs a 0.02 (0.01)% increase in test scores for reading (science). Our interpretation of this result is that more experience of learning the language of the host country in daily life improves students' linguistic abilities, which are necessary for reading."}, {"section_title": "IV. Results", "text": "Linguistic ability plays a role in understanding science, but is less important in understanding mathematics. In columns (1)-(3), H_FATH and H_MOTH are significantly positive whereas H_BROTH and H_SISTE are significantly negative. Living with parents improves cognitive skills partly because parents take care of their children's daily life, which in turn improves academic performance. In contrast, the existence of siblings is considered to reduce educational quality because average spending on children's education decreases as the number of children increases. For robustness check, total minutes of class study on each subject are included as independent variables and the results are shown in Table 4 . We see from Table 4 that the coefficients of STU_MATH, STU_SCIE, and STU_READ are positive and statistically significant at the 1% level, suggesting that inputs for each subject increase the output (test score). Concerning other variables, the estimation results of Table 4 are almost identical to those of Table 3 . Moreover, the estimation results of Table 3 are robust for alternative specifications.\nAs pointed out by Fryer and Levitt (2010) , the influences of females' social condition on test scores disappear when PISA data is restricted to countries that overlapped with the TIMSS data. For further robustness check, Table 5 reports the results based on the \"TIMSS-PISA overlap\" samples. The upper part of Table 5 shows the results based on a sub-sample of countries that are equivalent to the \"TIMSS-PISA 2003 overlap\" countries of Fryer and Levitt (2010) . The number of countries included in PISA 2012 increased relative to PISA 2003, the data source for Fryer and Levitt (2010) . Therefore, the lower part of Table 5 shows the results based on using a sub-sample of countries equivalent to the \"TIMSS-PISA 2012 overlap\" countries. In Table 5 , a significant positive sign of WAGE_FM * FEMALE is persistently observed for mathematics, while for science it is not statistically significant. Turning to LATE and SKIP, both continue to show a significant negative sign for all subjects. All in all, restricting the analysis to a sub-sample does not influence the results, with the exception of the effect of WAGE_FM * FEMALE on science score.\nWe now turn our attention to the estimation results of Table 6 when LATE and SKIP are dependent variables. We focus on the results for WAGE_FM * FEMALE, which is the key variable. Existing works (Guiso et al., 2008; Fryer and Levitt 2010) Considering the direct and indirect effects together leads to a 1% decrease in the effect of the gender wage gap, resulting in it being 0.20%, 0.13% and 0.06% for mathematics, science and reading. Therefore, the total effect of the decrease in gender wage gap for mathematics is about 1.5 times larger than for science, and three times larger than for reading.\nWhat has been observed thus far implies that the gender wage gap influences quantity of study, which improves test scores in the three subjects equally. However, after controlling for quantity of study, the gender wage gap improves skills in mathematics and sciences, but not in reading. So, the effect of gender wage gap on attitude toward learning during class is thought to vary according to subject."}, {"section_title": "V. Conclusions", "text": "This paper examines how the gender wage gap influences the test scores of female versus male students. Using PISA 2012 matched with the gender wage gap sourced from WEF-GGI 2011, we compare the effect of the wage gap among the areas of mathematics, science and reading. Key findings are that a decrease in the gender wage gap leads to a decrease in truancy by female students, which in turn improves the test scores of female students in mathematics, science, and reading. Even after controlling this channel, decrease in the gender wage gap improves the test scores of female students in mathematics and science, though not reading. Combining the indirect and direct effects of the gender wage gap: for female students, each 1% decrease in the wage gap relative to males leads to a 0.20%, 0.13% and 0.06% increase in test scores for mathematics, science and reading, respectively.\nIn comparison with the existing works of Guiso et al. (2008) and Fryer and Levitt (2010) , the findings of this paper are more reliable because (1) analysis at the individual level lets us consider the effect of individual level characteristics, (2) the sample was restricted to child immigrants from other countries, reducing the possibility of reverse causality, (3) the countries included in the sample are larger. The findings of this paper made it evident that higher female wage level relative to male wage level incentivizes female students to attend school, resulting in their achieving higher test scores not only for mathematics, but also for science and reading. Table 3 . Values for STU_READ, STU_SCIE, and STU_MATH are calculated based on the sample used in Table 4 . The index of family wealth (WEALTH) is based on the students' responses regarding whether they had the following at home: a room of their own, an Internet connection, a dishwasher (treated as a country-specific item), a DVD player, and three other country-specific items; as well as their responses regarding the number of cellular phones, televisions, computers, cars and rooms with a bath or shower.
