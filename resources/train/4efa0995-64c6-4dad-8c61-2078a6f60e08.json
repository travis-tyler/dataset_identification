There was no measurable sediment gain or loss during the 24-h study period."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Seafl oor mapping and sedimentological studies of the continental shelf and submarine canyons of Monterey Bay, California, have provided a wealth of information about submarine canyon processes and the tectonic history of coastal California (Fig. 1) . Recent studies of high-resolution single beam and multibeam bathymetric data provide detailed interpretations of the tectonics, structure, geology, and surface processes of Monterey Bay and its submarine canyon (e.g., Greene et al., 2002; Eittreim et al., 2002a) . Additional studies have documented active slumps, turbidity currents, and canyon-axis \"fl ushing events\" affecting the Monterey Canyon head Garfi eld et al., 1994; Okey, 1997; Greene et al., 2002; Eittreim et al., 2002b; Paull et al., 2003 Paull et al., , 2005 Xu et al., 2004) . These studies show that the prevalent canyon-shaping processes include transform faulting, slumping, slump-controlled meanders, fault-controlled meanders, and sediment-gravity fl ows. Despite these efforts, relatively little is known about sediment transport frequency and processes or the rates of morphologic change in the canyon. It is unclear whether short-term processes, such as tidal fl ow and frequent sediment-gravity fl ows, or less-frequent, but higher magnitude, processes are most important for transporting the annual sediment budget through the upper canyon.\nBased upon recent studies, over 300,000 m 3 /yr of sediment is delivered to the canyon head by northward and southward littoral transport of sand sourced in rivers, coastal erosion, and material eroded from the enlarging Elkhorn Slough (Dingler et al., 1985; Best and Griggs, 1991; Mitts, 2003; Dean, 2003) . Although studies of sand petrology have established local watersheds as the chief canyon sediment source (Mitts, 2003) , the coastal sediment budget remains only loosely approximated (Best and Griggs, 1991) . The volume of littoral sediment that bypasses the canyon head along the beach is undocumented as well.\nLittle is known about the degree to which upper Monterey Canyon stores, transports, or adds to the sediment volume delivered to the head (Paull et al., 2003 (Paull et al., , 2005 Xu et al., 2004) . Based upon a longitudinal profi le, Paull et al. (2005) speculate that the upper canyon has been aggrading rather than transporting all the sediment supplied to it. Canyon wall morphology indicates that slumping provides additional material to the canyon axis on a less regular but sometimes massive scale (e.g., Greene et al., 2002) . Very recent slumping has been documented in the walls of the canyon head through serial observations spanning the time of the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake Okey, 1997) . However, sand composition in the canyon axis has not been signifi cantly infl uenced by recent canyon wall sources (Mitts, 2003) . Although gullies and sediment chutes are present in the canyon walls, past studies have not determined if they are relict or active features.\nSediment gravity fl ows have been documented in Monterey Canyon. Okey (1997) noted that in each fall season of a three year study, sediment stored near the Monterey Canyon head suddenly moved down canyon in response to a threshold in ocean surface energy. A few researchers have reported similar events in the heads of submarine canyons, using the term \"fl ushing event\" to describe the process (e.g., Shepard and Marshall, 1973; Okey, 1997) . The source of the sediment fl ushed from the head of Monterey Canyon includes the longshore drift, sediment deposited from river fl oods (Eittreim et al., 2002b; Mitts, 2003) , sediment dredged from the Moss Landing Harbor (e.g., MEC Analytical Systems, Inc., 2003) , and sediment eroded from the enlarging Elkhorn Slough estuary (Fig. 1; Brantner, 2001; Dean, 2003) . \"Flushing events\" are clearly the initiation of sediment gravity fl ows that periodically move sediment from the shelf-canyon break to deeper water. These sediment-gravity fl ows are apparently triggered by meteorological events that destabilize sediment stored near the canyon head (Okey, 1997; Paull et al., 2002; Xu et al., 2004) , but the details of canyon-head sediment storage and the mechanics of the sediment transport during fl ushing events are not well established.\nThis paper explores some of the long-term and more frequent processes shaping the upper Monterey Canyon based upon geomorphic interpretations of recently acquired high-resolution serial bathymetric data and derivative digital elevation models (DEMs). Comparison of three high-resolution DEMs shows the changes in the head and upper 4 km of the canyon during both a 6 month and 24 h period. We present evidence that relatively small-scale, but frequent, processes may be very important in shaping the morphology of the upper 4 km of the canyon, and we quantify the semiannual erosion and deposition rates within the upper canyon. Using serial bathymetric changes, we propose a conceptual model describing the periannual build-up and mass wasting of a sediment wedge at the canyon head. We also present a simple sequence of cutting and fi lling that has shaped upper Monterey Canyon. Lastly, we comment on the geomorphic effects of placing harbor dredge material near the canyon head."}, {"section_title": "Geologic Setting", "text": "Monterey Canyon extends from the mouth of Moss Landing Harbor at least 90 km offshore to over 3 km depth (Fig. 1) . The data and results presented in this paper are restricted to the upper 4 km of the canyon between water depths of 10 and 250 m (Figs. 2 and 3) .\nThe upper canyon occupies the Salinian structural block, between the San Andreas and Palo Colorado-San Gregorio fault zones of the North American-Pacifi c plate boundary . Vertical motion of the Salinian block has led to a complex canyon history, with multiple episodes of cutting, widening, and fi lling starting before 10 Ma . The most recent canyon cutting occurred in Quaternary time if Wagner et al. (2002) are correct in mapping the Quaternary Aromas Sand, in the uppermost reach of the canyon.\nThe canyon walls are draped by fi ne-grained marine sediment (Paull et al., 2005) and are dissected by gullies and landslide features. The canyon fl oor contains terraces (D in Fig. 4 ) that bound a dynamic axial channel (E in Fig. 4 ) that transports fi ne-to medium-grained beach sand and gravel entering the canyon head (Paull et al., 2005; Mitts, 2003) . The areas mapped in 2002 and 2003 were executed using the same survey line fi les. An Applanix heading and motion sensor with 0.02\u00b0 precision corrected for ship motion. An Applied Microsystems Limited Sound Velocity Plus sound velocity profi ler was deployed for later adjustment of depth soundings. The wind conditions for all three surveys were relatively calm with fl at seas. The multibeam sonar collected bathymetric data across 150\u00b0 of swath coverage, using 101 1.5\u00b0 \u00d7 1.5\u00b0 beams. All raw data were logged using a Triton-Elics International Isis Sonar data acquisition system. Survey data fi les were fi ltered and cleaned using Caris Hips software. Shoal-biased bathymetry data sets exported from Caris Hips with 2 m horizontal resolution were examined in Interactive Visualization Systems Fledermaus software for further cleaning, geomorphic analysis, and for exporting grids and geotiffs to ArcMap GIS software for analysis of georeferenced serial images. Resolution of the bathymetry data was such that landscape features and differences on the order of 0.2 m vertical and 3.0 m horizontal were clearly discernable. Data were rigorously edited by hand for spurious points and smoothed and gridded to a 3 m interval to minimize data gaps in the fi nal xyz export.\nAccuracy and precision are a function of positioning and attitude measurement errors, timing errors, water depth, tidal correction, and the water sound velocity profi le. Errors caused by sensor misalignment, sensor inaccuracy, and timing issues were minimized through standard hydrographic survey patch-test calibration methods performed using sewer outfall pipeline of the nearby city of Marina as a benchmark before each survey. Tidal correction was performed using NOAA-predicted tide values for Monterey Bay for the 2002 survey in which differentially-corrected GPS positioning was used, while the 2003 surveys utilized high-precision three-dimensional RTK positioning that allowed soundings to be referenced to a true vertical datum rather than the water surface, removing the infl uence of tide from the equation. Predicted tide values used for tidal correction in 2002 agreed with NOAA tide-gauge data, unavailable at the time of the survey, to within 10 cm (mean error \u00b1 SD = 0.05 \u00b1 0.02 m) over the time period of the survey. Measured tidal variation using RTK positioning in 2003 also closely agreed with the observed tide-gauge data (mean error = 0.10 \u00b1 0.04 m). We found that tidal corrections from RTK positioning were more accurate during this sampling period than using predicted tides, which deviated further from the observed values (mean error = 0.60 \u00b1 0.06 m). At least one water column sound velocity profi le was collected on each sampling day for use in correcting sounding solutions for sound velocity variation.\nBecause the analyses performed in this study required comparison of serial DEMs of seafl oor morphology, care was taken to ensure that the data sets were properly georeferenced and in vertical registration with one another. The bathymetric grids were vertically registered by slightly shifting one with respect to the other until elevation differences were minimized on fl at, stable surfaces that likely remained unchanged between surveys. Between-survey precision of the DEMs was then evaluated using known anthropogenic and natural landmarks that were (1) Precision was similar for another landmark, the defunct National Refractories water intake pipe (4.32 m horizontal, 0.51 m vertical). The horizontal error was judged to be relatively small compared to the largest potential sources of error in the overall error budget and was deemed acceptable because it was on the order of one pixel in the horizontal dimension.\nThe six-month canyon-fl oor sediment budget was calculated in ArcMap 8.2 by subtracting the bathymetry of the 2003 DEM from the 2002 DEM to determine the net bathymetric change in each pixel. The net vertical differences in each 3 \u00d7 3 m pixel were multiplied by the pixel area (9 m 2 ) and added to arrive at the net volume difference in specifi c areas of the canyon. To greatly reduce the chance of including \"noise\" in our calculations, we only included pixels showing net vertical changes of greater than \u00b1 1 m. Our exclusive use of those high-value pixels has two implications. First, our estimates of bathymetric and sediment-volume changes are underestimates if large regions of the canyon had depth changes of less than \u00b1 1 m in depth. Second, we would overestimate erosion if local erosion, much greater than 1 m, liberated sediment that was redeposited onto a broader area at a thickness less than 1 m. The bathymetric changes presented here include error estimates calculated by multiplying the between-grid depth precision (\u00b10.5 m) by the sum of the areas of the pixels used in the calculation of bathymetric change (i.e., those with greater than 1 m differences)."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "General Morphology", "text": "Within the study area, the canyon fl oor width ranges from 30 m to 440 m.

The canyon has an average top width of ~1000 m. The top width increases rapidly down canyon.

Gullies are nearly straight, steep-fl oored (12\u00b0 to 20\u00b0) sediment conduits with well-developed channel sides, whereas chute complexes are steeper and have branching, straight channels. The chute complex present northwest of the narrows has a slope of 25\u00b0 and very straight channels that branch upward into a tributary network (Fig. 2) . The southeastern canyon wall beginning 500 m downstream from the narrows is creased with many straight, parallel chutes and gullies (Figs. 2 and 5). These features are crosscut by a 20-m-tall canyon fl oor terrace at their downslope terminations. Two gullies on the south canyon wall located ~500 m from the southern tributary head grew headward ~60 m during the six month period (Fig. 7) . A 5-mtall terrace located at the mouths of the gullies was removed through lateral erosion during the same time period (Fig. 7) .\nThree sections of canyon wall are dominated by slump and other slope-failure features (Fig. 5) . Within each of these reaches there are nested headwall scarps with varying degrees of rounding, suggesting multiple slump events with a range of relative ages. The largest slump complex we imaged is at least 700 m wide, starting ~400 m down canyon from the narrows on the northeast canyon wall (Figs. 2 and 5) . The down-canyon edge of the slump lies beyond the western edge of our data (Fig. 2) . This slump complex includes a broad, arcuate headwall scarp with well-rounded slopes. The toe of the large slide is bordered by terraces along the axial channel, suggesting that the terrace-forming processes are more recent than the slope failure. Within the main slide body are several minor slump features.\nA more sharply defi ned slide complex is located on the northwestern canyon wall ~600 m up canyon from the narrows (Figs. 2  and 8 ). At the base of the slide scar there is a stepped terrace that helps defi ne an \"intracanyon meander\" (Fig. 8 ; Greene et al., 2002) . The intersection of the terrace and the northwestern canyon wall defi nes a broad canyon wall meander (Fig. 8) . The terrace material at the toe of the slump scar lacks the hummocky topography typical of slide deposits. "}, {"section_title": "Canyon Floor", "text": "The canyon fl oor can be divided into two geomorphic regions: (1) an axial channel that contains active sand waves (E in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 ), and (2) complex terraces that locally bound the axial channel on both sides of the canyon (D in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5) .\nOne striking feature of these high-resolution images is the sand-wave fi eld on the canyon fl oor, which previous imagery has not revealed (Fig. 2) . In general the sand waves have crescentic to undulating crests, which commonly can be traced for 100 m. The sand waves are strongly asymmetric with slip faces oriented down canyon, indicating a dominant downslope sediment transport direction. (Fig. 10A) . In both years, the wavelengths shorten up canyon with increased canyon fl oor gradient. For example in 2003, the northern tributary had waves with an average length of 26 m and average height of 2-3 m (Fig. 10B) . Serial longitudinal profi les of the sand waves over a 24-h period between 24 and 25 March 2003 show no signifi cant change in the sand waves during a full tidal cycle.\nTerraces are locally present on both sides of the axial channel ( Fig. 5; D in Fig. 4) . The terrace complex located in the deepest part of the study area (point E in Fig. 2 ) includes two terraces with the lower terrace 20 m above the axial channel and the higher terrace 50 m above the axial channel. The lower terrace riser is very straight in map view (Fig. 2) . The terrace complex located 1000 m down canyon from the head contains several minor depositional or erosional surfaces and a perched channel that lies above the grade of the modern axial channel. This apparently abandoned channel is cut off from the head tributaries by a 2-m-tall erosional scarp, and its mouth hangs several meters above the axial channel (Figs. 2 and 11) .\nThe six-month canyon-fl oor sediment budget was calculated by subtracting the bathymetric data collected in 2003 from those collected in 2002. Sediment storage in the tributaries, erosion in meander bends and fl oor margins, and terrace-forming incision are well defi ned in the resulting image (Fig. 6) .

We partition the sediment load among canyon head tributaries and discuss the role of canyon processes in modifying the sediment budget passing through the upper canyon.\nThe northernmost canyon head tributary (point D in Fig. 2) is the southern terminus of a littoral cell extending as far north as the San Francisco Bay (Best and Griggs, 1991) . Littoral sediment entering the northern tributary . Eittreim et al. (2002b) conservatively suggest using the lower limit of 200,000 m 3 as an annual average. Because the northern harbor breakwater terminates virtually at the shelf-canyon break (Fig. 2) , it is not likely that a signifi cant portion of the southbound littoral drift bypasses the breakwater or the canyon head. Therefore the breakwater may play a signifi cant role in limiting the sand budget of southern Monterey Bay. Previous studies also indicate that signifi cant littoral sediment does not bypass the Monterey Canyon head (Sayles, 1966; Tait and Revenaugh, 1998) .\nThe tributary head terminating between the Moss Landing Harbor breakwaters (Fig. 2) is the seaward extension of Elkhorn Slough, an enlarging coastal estuary. During the six month period, ~73,000 m 3 of sediment were naturally deposited in a sediment wedge at the Harbor mouth, while only 4000 m 3 were naturally eroded (Fig. 6) , leaving a net volume in the wedge of 69,000 m 3 . This sediment wedge is built from a combination of sediment eroded from Elkhorn Slough, littoral drift from the south, and littoral drift from the north that managed to be carried through the narrow passage between the northern tributary mouth and the end of the northern breakwater (Fig. 2) . Although between 56,000 m 3 and 86,000 m 3 of sediment are annually eroded from Elkhorn Slough (Brantner, 2001; Dean, 2003) , it is unclear how much of that sediment enters the canyon head because much of the eroded material is likely to be suspended fi ne sediment that either bypasses the head or settles in still water of intervening Moss Landing harbor. The sediment temporarily deposited in Moss Landing Harbor commonly reaches the canyon through dredging efforts. The two southern tributary heads (near point C in Fig. 2) annually receive somewhere between 50,000 m 3 and 155,000 m 3 of sand-size littoral drift sediment transported northward from seacliff erosion and the mouth of the Salinas River (Dingler et al., 1985; Watson et al., 2003; E. Thornton, 2003, personal commun.) . The presence of a 350-m-wide submarine dune fi eld immediately down canyon from these tributaries attests to the energetic transport of sand-sized sediment entering the canyon from the south (Fig. 2) . Sediment entering the southern tributaries has locally aggraded the channel in excess of 2 m (Fig. 6) . These canyon heads also sporadically receive the sediment dredged from Moss Landing Harbor. Approximately 16,200 m 3 of material dredged from the harbor was gradually placed very near the southern canyon heads (point D in Fig. 2 ) between 6 and 13 March, "}, {"section_title": "Sand Waves and Canyon Currents", "text": "Two canyon processes that can produce the requisite shear force to move the axial channel bedload are tidal currents and sediment gravity fl ows. The upper reach of Monterey Canyon receives and transports ~300,000 m 3 /yr of sediment derived from multiple external sources.

These tidal currents are therefore not responsible for developing the large bedforms associated with large-scale, down-canyon sediment transport."}, {"section_title": "Sediment-Gravity Flows", "text": "Several studies have detailed sediment-gravity fl ows in Monterey Canyon (e.g., Paull et al., 2003; Garfi eld et al., 1994; Xu et al., 2004) . Xu et al. (2004) reported that there were two signifi cant turbidity currents, likely sourced in upper Monterey Canyon, that occurred during the six months between our surveys. The fi rst occurred on 20 December 2002, coincident with very high surf and high terrestrial stream fl ow (Xu et al., 2004) . The maximum velocity at the moored instruments was 190 cm/s, more than enough velocity to move ambient sand in the axial channel as well as any suspended load in the current. (Fig. 6) . It is possible that the loose dredge material slid downslope as the trigger for the 14 March turbidity current recorded by Xu et al. (2004) . Alternatively, the dredged material may have washed away as suspended load in littoral currents.\nOur data indicate that strong down-canyon currents are capable of signifi cant geomorphic work and sediment transport. The elimination of tidal currents as a mechanism and the coincidental turbidity currents measured by Xu et al. (2004) lead us to conclude that sediment Shepard (1981) suggested that small but frequent turbidity currents might be the dominant sediment transport mechanism along modern submarine canyons. We propose that Monterey Canyon undergoes a subannual cycle of sediment deposition at the lip of the canyon followed by slope failure when a critical combination of variables exceeds the strength of the sediment wedge. When the slope fails, the sediment is transported by some combination of sediment gravity fl ow processes. The reports of resuspended sediment visible at the sea surface (\"fl ushing event;\" e.g., Okey, 1997) suggest that large-scale mixing occurs during the initiation of sediment transport, probably leading to a turbidity current."}, {"section_title": "Sedimentary Cycles at the Monterey Canyon Head", "text": "During the six month study, a prograding sediment wedge moved the shelf-slope break ~10 m seaward in the tributary located at the mouth of Moss Landing Harbor. It is unclear if the ~73,000 m 3 of sediment in the sediment wedge gradually accumulated during the entire six months or if the canyon experienced one or more interim progradation-slope failure cycles during the study period. Evidence supporting at least one sediment-gravity fl ow sourced in the canyon head is the complete reorganization of the sand waves in the bottom of the canyon and signifi cant amount of channel scour during the same time span (Figs. 6 and 9) .\nEnvironmental conditions that could trigger slope failure of the sedimentary wedge are regularly achieved at the lip of Monterey Canyon. Slope failure at the lip of Monterey Canyon probably occurs when storm waves destabilize a growing sediment wedge that has the proper combination of sediment thickness, grain size distribution, and seaward slope. Storm waves of only 2.5 m in height were able to destabilize the 15-m-deep Huanghe Delta on a slope of less than 1% (Prior et al., 1989) . Conditions for slope failure are far greater at the Monterey Canyon where the sediment wedge lies at ~10 m depth, the seaward slope on the sediment wedge is greater than 25%, and winter waves regularly exceed 3 m. During the six-month study period there were fi ve signifi cant storms, including a storm with 8.5 m seas (Renard, 2003) .\nThe combination of anecdotal evidence (e.g., Okey 1997), remotely deployed instruments (Garfi eld et al., 1994; Paull et al., 2003; Xu et al., 2004) , and serial bathymetry demonstrates that Monterey Canyon actively transports sand and gravel and does so through subannual sedimentgravity fl ows, including turbidity currents."}, {"section_title": "Geomorphic Processes and Canyon Evolution", "text": "The detailed bathymetric images allow us to propose a two-dimensional, three-phase evolutionary model for the upper Monterey Canyon (Fig. 13) . We emphasize that the canyon has very likely had a more complex history (e.g., ), but the model includes the minimum, large-scale, defensible steps that are required to develop the canyon cross section that we see today near the tall terrace complex (point B in Fig. 11 ).\nPhase one is large-scale incision into preexisting landscape and substrate that began at least 10 million years ago . The canyon walls, above the canyon fl oor terraces, are composed of weakly consolidated Pleistocene Aromas Sand (Wagner et al., 2002) or a veneer of mud over that formation (Paull et al., 2005) . By analogy with modern terrestrial watershed systems, the canyon underwent repeated cycles of downcutting, widening, and partial fi lling that resulted in excavation of a deep, broad canyon.\nPhase two is partial fi lling of the canyon (Fig. 13) . These deposits compose the modern terraces that stand tall above the modern axial channel; therefore, the canyon fi lled at least as high as the top of the highest local terraces. Vibracore sample 87 (Fig. 12) shows that at least one of the terraces comprises interstratifi ed sand and silt (Mitts, 2003) , with mud being the dominant component (Table 1; Paull et al., 2005) . The stratifi ed fi ne-grained deposits in the terrace indicate deposition in a relatively low-energy environment with reduced input of Table 1 . coarse clastic sediment. These deposits may have resulted from rising sea level or damming by down-canyon landslides. Landslide dams have been interpreted much farther down canyon as well . It is possible that the fi ll material itself is landslide debris from the canyon walls; however, the terraces have relatively fl at, low-gradient surfaces suggestive of in situ deposition, in contrast to the more disturbed landforms associated with submarine landslide deposits elsewhere (e.g., Greene et al., 2002) . Lastly, if the terraces were landslide debris from the Aromas Sand composing the canyon wall, they would be composed of nearly 100% wellsorted Aeolian and fl uvial sand. Phase three is incision and advection of the previously deposited fi ll material as vigorous currents locally carved a series of axial channels in the canyon fl oor (Fig. 13 ). Phase 3A (Fig. 13) shows the formation of the now-abandoned channel located north of the tall terrace (point A in Fig. 11 ). That channel has relict, low-amplitude sand waves, indicating that it was once providing the same function as the modern axial channel. Phase 3B (Fig. 13) shows the incision of the modern axial channel. The incision beheaded the channel formed in phase 3A time, pirating the sand bedload to the south side of the canyon fl oor. Sand waves located in the abandoned channel are not as sharply defi ned as the waves in the axial channel but are clearly not deeply buried by Holocene mud, suggesting a relatively recent age for downcutting of the abandoned channel and the modern axial channel. In total 25 m of incision is recorded on the south side of the terrace (Fig. 11) . The canyon fl oor along the narrows has no fi ll terraces, so either the phase-two fi ll never accumulated there to great depth, or phase-three advection is nearly complete. Conservation of mass likely accelerates sediment gravity fl ows in relatively narrow reaches of submarine canyons. The resulting higher velocity in the narrows would favor erosion over deposition."}, {"section_title": "Evidence for Continued Phase-Three Erosion", "text": "Both erosion and sediment deposition play a signifi cant role in the subannual evolution of the canyon fl oor, but we suggest that phase-three fi ll excavation is the dominant canyon process today. The young age of some terraces is demonstrated in serial images taken six months apart showing lateral erosion that removes the edges of terraces and local downcutting that produces new terraces (e.g., Figs. 6, 7, and 8) .\nWidening of the axial channel can potentially destabilize the canyon walls through undercutting. Lateral erosion is apparent in Figure 7 , where a terrace was removed during the six month study. Removal of that terrace may have initiated a headcut that rapidly migrated up slope leading to local gully head extension (Fig. 7) . The Aromas Sand is poorly consolidated, so headcut migration may proceed rapidly. The intracanyon meanders show very concentrated scour at the outsides of bends (Fig. 6) . Minor headwall scarps are present where the scour is deep along the intracanyon meanders (point C in Fig. 11 ), suggesting both that the terrace was undercut and that the slump toe was advected down gradient. The obvious concentration of shear stress on the margins of the axial channel is evidence supporting the contention of Greene et al. (2002) that canyon wall undercutting is a modern mechanism for destabilizing slopes and triggering slumps in submarine canyons.\nChutes present in the outer wall of the bend of the narrows are also indicative of canyon widening (Fig. 2) . The sharpness of the ridges dividing the chute channels northwest of the narrows indicates that the chute system is not relict but instead is a frequent pathway for debris sourced through headward extension of the chute system into the continental shelf."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "Our interpretations support and build upon those of Paull et al. (2005) , who document the canyon as a very active sediment transport system, despite the modern high eustatic sea level. The fl oor of Monterey Canyon has experienced a complex Holocene history of fi lling and erosion. Lateral erosion and vertical incision have been the most recent canyon-shaping processes. The dominant process in the recent past has been downcutting of the axial channel, incrementally increasing the relief on the canyon walls. The formation of submarine canyon terraces is analogous to fl uvial terrace formation; channel incision through older valley fi ll leaves the axial channel lower in elevation, separated from a fl at bench by a tall scarp (Fig. 11) . Canyon-widening processes are expressed as slumps, gullies, and chutes. Relatively recent events include channel margin erosion and gully enlargement (Figs. 6 and 7) .\nIn this report we speculate that the subannual terrace-building incision shown in the data is part of a monotonic trend of canyon-fi ll advection and that the sediment build-up at the canyon head is part of a periannual cycle of sediment storage and down-canyon transport. As support for monotonic advection of terrace fi ll, we point to the present large height of the terrace scarps, which may record the cumulative result of many years of incremental active-channel incision. Further, the relative youth of the abandoned channel (point A in Fig. 11 ) indicates recent net downcutting of the axial channel, beyond the amount detected in the six month comparison.\nBoth of these speculative points can be tested with future high-precision hydrographic surveys of the upper Monterey Canyon.
