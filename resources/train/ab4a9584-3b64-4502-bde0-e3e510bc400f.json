In Crescent City, the first three and one-half hours of the 2011 tsunami was analyzed using video footage taken from the entrance to the small boat basin. The largest amplitude tide gauge water-level oscillations and most of the damage occurred within this time window. Currents reached a maximum speed of approximately 4.5 m/s with peak values exceeding 3 m/s for six cycles (tsunami periods). Tsunami current velocities in Humboldt Bay and Crescent City were compared to calculated velocities from the Method of Splitting Tsunamis (MOST) numerical model. The frequency and pattern of current amplification and decay at both locations are replicated by the MOST model for the first several hours after the tsunami onset. MOST underestimates peak current velocities by about 10 -20% on average, and by as much as 50% for some peaks. At Humboldt Bay, MOST predicted attenuation of the signal after four hours but the actual signal persisted at a nearly constant level for at least twice as long. The results from this thesis demonstrate that ADCPs can effectively record tsunami currents for small to moderate events and can be used to calibrate and validate models (i.e. MOST) in order to better predict hazardous tsunami conditions and improve planned responses to protect lives and property, especially within harbors.

Thirty-five tsunamis have been observed since a tide gauge was installed in Crescent City in 1933, including twelve with maximum peak-to-trough wave heights exceeding one meter and five that caused damage NGDC, 2013). Crescent City, located in Del Norte County just south of the Oregon border (Figure 1), is particularly vulnerable to tsunamis ( Table 1). The M w 9.2 March 28, 1964 Alaska earthquake triggered a tsunami that produced significant damage and 11 deaths in Del Norte County, more than any other location outside of Alaska (Dengler and Magoon, 2005). Damage from the 2006 tsunami was estimated at US $28 million dollars (Dengler et al., 2008;Dengler et al., 2009;Young, 2013). The 2006 damage had yet to be repaired when the 2011 tsunami generated by the M w 9.0 Japan earthquake demolished almost all remaining structures in the harbor and caused an additional US $26 million in damage (Wilson et al., 2012a;Young, 2013). All damage from the 2006 and 2011 tsunamis at Crescent City was the result of strong currents in the harbor. There was no on-land flooding by the 2006 tsunami, and only minimal flooding during the 2011 event. Currents produced by the Japan tsunami also caused significant damage at over two dozen other California locations (Wilson et al., 2012a). These events illustrate the vulnerability of ports and harbors to strong tsunami currents and the importance of understanding their impacts.  The tsunami current observations in Humboldt Bay and Crescent City were used to assess the predicted currents from the MOST computer model."}, {"section_title": "PREVIOUS ESTIMATES OF TSUNAMI CURRENT VELOCITY", "text": "A number of studies have approximated tsunami currents through a variety of techniques including displaced objects, characteristics of tsunami deposits, instruments, and video analysis. Tsunami currents are also routinely predicted in numerical modeling studies. Peak current estimates for the observation of displaced objects resulting from the 1993 Hokkaido M w 7.8 earthquake in Japan were on the order of 10-18 m/s (Shimamoto et al., 1995;Tsutsumi et al., 2000). The minimum velocity that could explain the displacement was 5.3 m/s (Tsutsumi et al., 2000). Several studies have inferred current velocities from analysis of tsunami deposits. To analyze a continuous time sequence of currents, instrumental recording with sampling intervals on the order of 1 min or less is necessary to adequately resolve tsunami variations. The 2006 Kuril Islands tsunami produced coastal trapped waves that were measured with an upward-looking, high-resolution ADCP (part of the Kilo Nalu Near-Shore Reef Observatory) deployed offshore Oahu, HI, at 12 m water depth (Bricker et al., 2007). Analysis of the pressure and velocity measurements found that the highest surge observed near Oahu arrived 1.5 hrs after the tsunami arrival with a maximum height of 0.17 m and a maximum velocity of approximately 0.12 m/s. The highest surges and runup was due to the superposition of tsunami waves from the ocean, seiches, and coastal trapped waves of various frequencies propagating along the coast (Bricker et al., 2007). An ADCP on the inner shelf of Monterey Bay in California recorded the 2010 Chile tsunami (Lacey et al., 2012) as part of a study that was investigating wave-driven sediment dynamics. With a sampling interval of 2 min, the ADCP measured a maximum, depth-averaged velocity of 0.36 m/s during the largest tsunami wave. The tsunami waves were directed cross shore (north-south) with an approximate period of 16 min for the first few hours of the event. The tsunami persisted for several days in the bay, interpreted by the authors as resonance (Lacey et al., 2012). Tide gauge and current data were analyzed in New Zealand following the 2011 Japan event       N 124.183704\u00b0W ( Figure 6). In most cases, only one object was present in the flow or easily identified for observation for each 10 s frame. The ruler tool was used to approximate the distance between the start and end locations for every 10 s pair of observations. The 10 s estimates were averaged over 1 min intervals to generate a surface velocity time series for Crescent City. The NOAA tide gauge data was used to verify and correct the video camera time-stamp, which began at 1508 UTC. The standard deviation of velocity was computed for each minute by calculating the standard deviation over the six estimates per minute using Excel. Throughout the time series, the standard deviation ranged between 0.02 and 1.84 m/s, with a mean overall of 0.29 m/s during the period of observation. Over 60% of the standard errors were less than 0.20 m/s; 95% of the standard errors were less than 1.00 m/s. In general, standard errors were significantly larger near slack flow conditions. During these periods, it was clear from the video footage that there was substantial variability in the flow across the "}, {"section_title": "METHODS FOR ISOLATING THE TSUNAMI SIGNAL", "text": "Time series analysis defines a series' variability in terms of dominant periodic functions and usually involves statistical procedures that regard the data series as subsets of stochastic processes. Tidal currents are less easily predicted than water level due to stratification, nonlinear interactions, and basin topography complexities (Emery and Thomson, 2004). Tides can typically be thought of as governed by a stochastic process, in which the nature of variability is constant in time. However, tsunamis are nonstationary meaning that the parameters of the governing stochastic process vary with time. This can pose complications with analysis methods. In A method for visually assessing the evolution of the spectral energy distribution over time will be described for the 2010 and 2011 tsunami time series. The method will be used to examine how the arrival of a tsunami affects the spectral characteristics of water level and current variability. With the signal of interest having a higher frequency and different pattern than the tidal signal, several different methods can be used to remove the non-tsunami signals from the time series. This approach is necessary to characterize the evolution of the tsunami with time as well as provide data sets for assessment of the isolated tsunami signal. The methods explored in this study to isolate the tsunami signal from the nontsunami signals are described below."}, {"section_title": "WAVELET ANALYSIS", "text": "Wavelet analysis represents a relatively recent approach to the examination of time series. First introduced in the 1980s as a method for processing seismic data, it has subsequently been applied to the fields of meteorology and oceanography. The advantages of wavelet analysis over Fourier analysis include a localized, \"instantaneous\" estimate for the amplitude and phase of each spectral component as opposed to the record-averaged values of amplitude and phase resulting from Fourier analysis. This advantage is particularly important for non-stationary time series where the amplitudes and phases change rapidly in time and space. In short, wavelet analysis allows for the observation of how the signal changes with as one moves through the data set by decomposing a time series into time-frequency space (Torrence and Compo, 1998;Emery and Thomson, 2004). The method used in this study is modified from Torrence and Compo (1998) and  and involves the wavelet transform of the data. This approach will be used to provide a visual representation, in the form of wavelet power spectrogram, of how the spectral energy distribution varies over time in the time series and isolated tsunami signals of both water level and current measurements for the 2010 and 2011 tsunamis in Humboldt Bay and the water level measurements for the 2011 tsunami in Crescent City.

The transformed values were then used to compute the power and a wavelet power spectrogram is plotted using the log 2 of the power."}, {"section_title": "HIGH-PASS FILTERING", "text": "A high-pass filter method was used in this thesis to separate the tidal and tsunami components by isolating a particular range of frequencies observed in a time series. I wrote a 4 th order, phase-preserving, high-pass Butterworth filter program in MATLAB that was used to isolate the high frequency signal in the water level and velocity time series in Humboldt Bay during the 2010 and 2011 events and water level time series in Crescent City during the 2011 event. A range of cutoff periods shorter than the 12 hr tidal period were analyzed; however, significant energy in the measurements before the tsunami was present and did not diminish until a 60 min cutoff period was used. See Appendix B for the detailed methodology used in this study. While this filter method provides an initial estimation of the tsunami arrival time, duration and velocity and water level amplitudes, it has several limitations. The major limitation is the inability of this filter to handle and account for the non-stationarity of the tsunami as it progresses with time. Additionally, the cutoff period of 60 min presents issues of frequency overlap between tsunami and tidal variations which may be removing lower-frequency energy in the tsunami signal."}, {"section_title": "FOURIER AND AUTOREGRESSIVE ANALYSIS", "text": "Another method used in this study in an attempt to isolate the tsunami signal was a combination of Fourier and autoregressive analysis.

Fourier analysis and autoregressive time series modeling on one-year's worth of 6 min water level data prior to the 2010 event and one year prior the 2011 event in Humboldt Bay (see Appendix C for a detailed methodology) was done using a program I created in R. While the analysis performed well in projecting the time series onto the required sine and cosine curves for the years analyzed, the limitation of this method was observed in the forward projection in time.

A method, presented by , which included a combination of harmonic analysis and high-frequency noise suppression was used in this thesis for the separation of the tsunami signal from the non-tsunami variations observed in the velocity and water level time series. In classical harmonic analysis, the tide is modelled as a combination of sinusoids at very specific frequencies determined by astronomical motions (see, for example, Emery and Thomson, 2004). The freely-available MATLAB toolbox called T-tide (Pawlowicz et al., 2002) was used to analyze the water level and velocity to determine the amplitudes and phases of the dominant tidal frequencies in Humboldt Bay. For the 2010 tsunami, a three-month period before the tsunami (Nov. 8, 2009-Feb. 26, 2010 was used to determine tidal constituents for water level and a one-month period after the tsunami (Mar. 3 -Apr. 7, 2010) was used in a similar way for velocity. The shorter time range used for determining the velocity tidal constituents is a consequence of issues in maintaining continuous velocity observations during the early stages of this project. The The amplitudes, phases and frequencies computed by T-tide were used to predict tidal heights and currents during the 2010 and 2011 events in Humboldt Bay, and to predict the tidal heights during the 2011 event in Crescent City. The predicted tides were then subtracted from the observations to provide detided time series. Following the approach by , the signals were subsequently passed through a one-dimensional wavelet de-noising function that removed the high-frequency noise from the detided time series (Donoho and Johnstone;1994). After the data were detided and de-noised, the residual time series outside the tsunami period exhibited fairly regular periodicity in the water level at periods of 10-12 hrs ( Figure 7) and in the velocity at periods of 4-6 hrs (Figure 8). Figures 7 and 8 demonstrate the periodicity in the residual for the water level and velocity time series in Humboldt Bay during the 2011 Japan tsunami. The reason behind the residual signals is not entirely clear. It may be due to an insufficiently long period of data to separate adequately two closely-tuned tidal constituents, S2 (period 12.00 hr) and K2 (period 11.97 hr); in the case of the velocity estimates, there may also be higher order harmonics sometimes observed in shallow water conditions (e.g., M4, period 6.21 hr, caused by nonlinear self-interaction of the M2 constituent).

All the modeling in this report was done by Dr. Burak Uslu of NOAA's Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory. The tsunami currents produced by the 2010 Chile and 2011 Japan tsunamis were modeled using the NOAA's Tsunami Propagation Database (Gica et al., 2008;Wei et al., 2008;Tang et al., 2009) and the MOST model (Titov and Gonzalez, 1997;Titov and Synolakis, 1998).   Tsunami propagation is computed by solving non-linear shallow water equations in a finite difference model by increasing the resolution of the grid as the water depth decreases towards the harbor. Tsunami heights and currents are passed through at the boundary of the coarse grid from the database and then passed through nested grids (  (Wei et al., 2008;Tang et al., 2009); the methodology used conforms to the standards and procedures outlined by Synolakis et al. (2008). The high resolution Humboldt Bay and Crescent City grids assume mean high water (MHW) for the vertical datum, WGS 1984 for the horizontal datum, and 0.027 for the Manning roughness coefficient of friction. These models have been benchmarked for the 1964 Alaska tsunami inundation distances, and the 1952 Kamchatka, 1960Chile, 1964Alaska, 1994Kuril Islands and 2006 Kuril Islands tsunami tide gauge records in previous studies ( Uslu et al., 2007;Uslu, 2008;Dengler et al., 2008;Dengler et al., 2009).

In this plot, the tsunami can be seen superimposed on the tidal signal. Figure 12D presents the detided, high-pass filtered and de-noised water level data for the same time period.

The video camera velocity estimates illustrate how dubious eyewitness current estimates can be. They also illustrate the real value in using security cameras to estimate velocity since they are usually in a fixed location and timestamped. Security cameras also have the ability to capture footage in places where tsunami currents are known to be high and cause damage thus increasing the risk of losing in situ instruments. However, in many security monitoring situations, the video footage is routinely reused within a day or two of the recording. It is important to contact all sources of such footage as soon as possible in order to preserve the data and to encourage security camera managers to use high-speed capture rates and time-stamping. The wavelet power spectrograms of the 2010 and 2011 tsunamis on the north coast show that there is a clear separation in frequency between tidal variations and tsunami energy. This separation is seen in both water level and velocity in Humboldt Bay for the 2010 Chile tsunami (Figure 9 and Figure 11) and 2011 Japan tsunami ( Figure   16 and Figure 18). For the 2010 event, the dominant tsunami periods observed in the water level ( Figure 10) and velocity ( Figure 12 about 10-20%, with a few peaks by as much as 50%. In Humboldt Bay, MOST predicts attenuation of the signal after four hours, when the observed currents continue to fluctuate within a nearly constant range for considerably longer. To address these discrepancies, future analysis using higher resolution grids and different tidal datums will be conducted in Humboldt Bay and Crescent City for both events. This project is the first phase of a more comprehensive one. Four additional ADCPs have been installed throughout Humboldt Bay as part of the Physical Oceanographic Real-Time System (PORTS) project which are equipped to measure vertical velocity in addition to horizontal velocity. The locations of these instruments are shown in Figure 1. These new instruments will be configured to yield similar sampling rates to the existing Fairhaven Terminal instrument. PORTS will provide a system that will aid in measuring and understanding the spatial variations of currents, including tsunami currents, in Humboldt Bay, and provide a link between the near off-shore environment and Humboldt Bay. An ADCP will be installed near the NOAA NOS tide gauge on Citizen's Dock in Crescent City in 2013 with the same sampling configuration as the ADCP in Humboldt Bay. It will measure currents at depth near the same location that the security camera footage captured. This will provide a comparison of the velocity measurements from the ADCP at depth and the video footage estimates of surface velocity for the entrance to the small boat basin in Crescent City for future tsunami events. All of the ADCP data in Humboldt Bay and Crescent City will eventually be available electronically in near real-time. As a part of a statewide maritime hazard analysis and mapping project, the video analysis technique used in this thesis will be applied to other coastal areas in California where security camera or amateur video footage is available. Future video analysis using other techniques may be conducted for the 2011 footage in Crescent City to get more accurate surface velocity measurements at the entrance to the small boat basin. Higher resolution MOST modeling will be done and compared to the 2010 and 2011 tsunamis in Humboldt Bay and to the 2011 tsunami in Crescent City to see if a smaller grid size (e.g. 10 m) can explain the underestimation and modeling discrepancies seen with the 30 m resolution predictions. Cross-correlation analysis of the 2010 and 2011 tsunami currents with the MOST model predictions will be conducted for Humboldt Bay and Crescent City. To identify regions of high, common power, cross-wavelet analysis of the 2010 and 2011 events in Humboldt Bay will also be conducted. A better understanding and direct measurements of the currents generated by tsunamis can be used to improve numerical modeling and to provide better estimates of the hazards in ports and harbors caused by currents. angle used includes the heading recorded by the ADCP for each measurement and the magnetic declination in Humboldt Bay (15.2\u00b0 east of true North). The reason for the rotation of the velocity components to true North coordinates was to put them in a more standard coordinate system for current analysis. The modeling used in this study (MOST numerical model) computes expected u and v velocity components, so the coordinate rotation also allows for a direct comparison between the observed and predicted currents."}, {"section_title": "Navigational charts of Humboldt Bay show that the channel near Fairhaven", "text": "Terminal trends approximately 25\u00b0 east of true North. Due to the shape of the bay near the terminal, the expected flow direction is along channel ( Figure A1).     signals are very similar in magnitude ( Figure B1), but the water level tsunami signal is much easier to identify in figure B2. Figures B3 and B4 present the 2011 tsunami event in Humboldt Bay. This event was larger than 2010, which can be seen in the graphs. The pre-tsunami velocity signal is very small in comparison to the post-tsunami arrival signal in both the velocity ( Figure   B3) and water level ( Figure B4) data for 2011 in Humboldt Bay. These filtered plots also show the similarities and differences between the 2010 and 2011 events in Humboldt Bay. The 2011 tsunami water level signal for Crescent City Harbor is shown in figure   B5. Crescent City observed much larger water level oscillations than what was observed in Humboldt Bay as well as the strongest currents observed on the north coast for the 2011 tsunami. As opposed to the 2010 Humboldt Bay tsunami signal, there is a clear difference in signal magnitude pre-and post-tsunami arrival. While these filtered plots appear to accurately represent the observed tsunami signals, there are drawbacks associated with this approach. The tsunamis are nonstationary and the Butterworth filter is unable to account for that. With the filtering method described above, low-frequency variations in currents and water levels before the tsunami (i.e., the tidal variations) are essentially reduced to zero, although we recognize that there is also likely some subsequent suppression of tsunami energy at periods on the order of 1-3 hrs. If we increase the cutoff period (e.g., from 60 to 120 min) then we begin to see energy in the currents and water level signal before the tsunami arrival which would bias towards the tsunami signal. Alternative filters with sharper rolloffs may be employed, but these still would not address the non-stationarity issue, or what appears to be some frequency overlap between the tsunami and tidal variations in Humboldt Bay.     Fourier and AR analyses were performed using the statistical package R. Two separate data sets for Humboldt Bay water levels were compiled from NOAA's Tides & Currents website, derived from tide gauge observations on the North Spit near Eureka, California: a year's worth (February 25, 2009-February 24, 2010 of data prior to the 2010 tsunami event, and a second year's worth (March 1, 2010 -February 28, 2011) prior to the 2011 event. The sampling interval for both data sets was 6-min (87,600 data points). A fast Fourier transform (FFT) was applied to each time series to identify the dominant frequencies. The FFT produces amplitude coefficients of (paired) sine and cosine terms whose periods are integer multiples of the 6-min data recording interval. In this case, the minimum period that can be observed is 12 min (two observations; the Nyquist period), and the maximum is one year. The Fourier coefficients were then converted to relative amplitudes by dividing the amplitude of each frequency by the first Fourier coefficient which corresponds to a frequency of 0. A plot of these relative amplitudes versus frequency (the power spectrum) allows identification of the dominant frequencies. Figures C1 and C2  A list of models were proposed that included increasingly larger sets of the dominant-frequency sine and cosine terms as predictors, and Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) was used to rank the models and select the most efficient. The AIC weights increase in likelihood gained from adding additional predictors against variance inflation due to additional predictors and hence prevents selection of over-parameterized models as optimal. From the proposed models, the model that included the top 100 frequencies (in descending order of relative amplitude) was the best model of periodicity in the observed time series. The residuals of this model were analyzed with autocorrelation (ACF) and partial autocorrelation (PACF) plots in order to determine candidates for the Autoregressive-Moving Average Model (ARMA) components for the model. This analysis indicated that the autocorrelation structure of the residuals was dominated by autoregressive (AR) components and that moving average components were essentially absent. Based on the ACF and PACF analysis, a second list of candidate models was proposed that included various sets of the sine and cosine predictors and a range of AR components. These are in the class of time series models referred to as autoregressive models with exogenous predictors, the external regressors in this case being the sine and cosine functions. The models were fit using R's arima function, which uses maximum likelihood to fit the regression (Fourier series) coefficients and the AR components simultaneously. The AIC was again used to rank the models and identify the one that best described the time series. In both cases (the year prior to the 2010 event and the year prior to the 2011 event), the best model contained 200 Fourier coefficients (the top 100 frequencies, each with a sine and cosine component) and had 11 th -order autoregressive components. Including the constant term (mean) and variance, these models include 213 estimated parameters. The final fitted model allows decomposition of the time series into four components: the mean, the periodic component, the autoregressive component, and the residuals ( Figures C3 and C4). The deconstruction of the time series clearly shows that the year's worth of water level data is dominated by periodicity and that the contribution from the autoregressive component is small by comparison. The model ranked best was then used to project into the future with the purpose of subtracting the projected water levels from the observed level to isolate the tsunami signal. For both cases, the model was projected into the future during the time of the 2010 and 2011 events in Humboldt Bay. Figures C5 and C6 show the projection with its 95% confidence interval (CI) plotted with the observed water level. The graphs show a phase offset between the observed and projected water levels, indicating that this method of Fourier and autoregressive analysis is not adequate to model tide signals into the future. This is most likely due to the fact that the tidal periodicity is not exactly composed of periods that are integer divisors of one year, whereas the Fourier analysis restricts periods to integer multiples of the temporal unit of observation, up to the length of the data record used in the analysis. This phase disagreement results in an inaccurate prediction by the model, and does not reflect what is observed. While the approach taken here did a good job of fitting the data used to derive the model, the projection into the future had drawbacks that limit the accurate prediction and description of the observed water level during the time of the 2010 and 2011 events.
