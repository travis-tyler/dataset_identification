It is projected that over 30% of people aged 65-74 will still be working in 2022, up from 20% in 2002 (Toossi, 2012) . In light of well-documented age-related declines in fluid cognitive ability (Park et al., 2002) , this change raises questions about risks to public safety. This may be particularly relevant for jobs with high cognitive demand, such as jobs requiring vigilance or sustained attention. Many real-life vigilance assignments affect public safety such as aviation (i.e., air traffic control, aircraft cockpit monitoring, TSA baggage inspection), military (i.e., intelligence gathering, cyber-security, seaboard navigation, unmanned vehicle flight), homeland security, medicine and long distance driving (Parasuraman, 1979; Warm et al., 2008; Shaw et al., 2009; Helton et al., 2010) . Vigilance performance is known to decline over time, a phenomenon known as the vigilance decrement. The decrement is evident as early as 5 min into the vigil (Teichner, 1974; Warm et al., 2008) though more typically within the first 15-30 min (e.g., Mackworth, 1948) . Despite this rapid decrement, many real-life vigilance assignments last for several hours with few rest breaks. While some professions requiring vigilance specifically exclude workers over a certain age (e.g., air traffic control), other professions do not (e.g., anesthesiology). Therefore, it is important to assess vigilance performance in retirement-aged people that are now in the workforce in increasing numbers. Our approach to a better understanding of effects of aging on vigilance was to measure the neurophysiology underlying vigilance performance in older and younger adults using functional transcranial doppler sonography (fTCD).\nDespite considerable research, there is no consensus concerning the effects of healthy aging on the vigilance decrement (e.g., Davies and Parasuraman, 1982; McAvinue et al., 2012) . Some studies find that older adults show poorer vigilance performance than young adults (Filley and Cullum, 1994; Mouloua and Parasuraman, 1995; Berardi et al., 2001; McAvinue et al., 2012) , while others find no age-related difference (Parasuraman and Davies, 1977; Davies and Parasuraman, 1982; Parasuraman et al., 1989; Parasuraman and Giambra, 1991; Deaton and Parasuraman, 1998) . For example, in a large longitudinal study with multiple age cohorts from 18 to 80+, Giambra and Quilter (1988) found no effect of age on vigilance performance. In another large study, McAvinue et al. (2012) did find effects of age on vigilance performance on the Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART; Robertson et al., 1997) . They found that younger adults outperformed their older counterparts. An examination of the underlying neurophysiology of aging during vigilance may shed light on the underlying performance processes involved, which could help to resolve some of the inconsistency in the literature.\nAlthough there have been several theories of the vigilance decrement, there are currently two predominant theories: mindlessness theory and resource theory (Wickens, 2002; Warm et al., 2008; Helton et al., 2010) . Mindlessness theory suggests that poor performance on vigilance arises when participants withdraw attention from the task due to the monotonous-yet easy-nature of the task (Robertson et al., 1997; Helton et al., 2005) . In contrast, resource theory suggests that the vigilance decrement can be better attributed to the participant expending attentional resources from a limited pool that is depleted with continuous task performance (Wickens, 2002; Warm et al., 2008; Helton et al., 2010) . While there is evidence to support both theories, the resource theory of vigilance is more comprehensively supported by studies using various methods of measuring workload including self-report measures-such as NASA-TLX (Hart and Staveland, 1988) or the Multiple Resource Questionnaire (MRQ; Boles and Adair, 2001) . By understanding the perceived workload of a task through such self-report workload measures, decrements in performance can be attributed to work and effort during a vigil rather than task disengagement (Hitchcock et al., 2003; Warm and Parasuraman, 2009; Shaw et al., 2010 Shaw et al., , 2013a Finomore et al., 2013) .\nPerhaps the strongest evidence for resource theory comes from neurophysiological studies of vigilance Lim et al., 2010; Langner et al., 2012; Shaw et al., 2013b) . While several neurophysiological tools have been used to study brain activity during vigilance, fTCD has shown a notably consistent pattern of results. fTCD is an ultrasound procedure that allows for continuous monitoring of cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) in the main-stem intracranial arteries. The logic underlying fTCD is that when a particular area of the brain becomes metabolically active, such as during the performance of mental tasks, there is an increase in by-products of metabolic activity such as carbon dioxide (CO 2 ). The increase in CO 2 leads to an increase in oxygenated blood flow velocity to that region to remove the waste products (Aaslid, 1986) . The middle cerebral artery (MCA) is commonly used to measure CBFV for complex cognitive tasks as it supplies 80% of the blood to each respective cerebral hemisphere's frontal lobe (Stroobant and Vingerhoets, 2000; Warm et al., 2008) .\nResource theory is also supported by findings that the absolute level of blood flow velocity in the brain varies directly with task difficulty (Hitchcock et al., 2003; Warm and Parasuraman, 2009; Shaw et al., 2010 Shaw et al., , 2012 Shaw et al., , 2013a , and the vigilance decrement is paralleled by a temporal decline in cerebral hemovelocity (Shaw et al., 2009; Warm and Parasuraman, 2009 ). Importantly, these CBFV effects are not present in control observers who are exposed to an identical vigilance task with no work imperative (Hitchcock et al., 2003; Shaw et al., 2009 Shaw et al., , 2012 . In addition, the CBFV effects are lateralized to the right cerebral hemisphere, consistent with PET and fMRI studies that point to a righthemispheric system in the functional control of vigilance performance Langner and Eickhoff, 2013) . However, much of the recent research has revealed that vigilance tasks imposing a strong demand on observers require resource recruitment from both the left and right cerebral hemispheres (Helton et al., 2010; Shaw et al., 2012 Shaw et al., , 2016 . Thus, bilateral increases in CBFV may be indicative of higher effort.\nIn light of evidence that bilateral hemispheric activation may help to maintain vigilance performance in young people (Shaw et al., 2016) , the motivating question for the current work was whether bilateral activation would also benefit vigilance performance in older people. Previous research has shown that for tasks during which young people show largely unilateral Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) signals, healthy older people show bilateral activation. This has been seen in tasks of episodic memory, semantic memory, working memory, perception and inhibitory control (Grady et al., 1994 (Grady et al., , 2005 and confirmed in meta-analyses (Spreng et al., 2010; Maillet and Rajah, 2014) . Cabeza (2002) synthesized this research into the Hemispheric Asymmetry Reduction in Older Adults (HAROLD) hypothesis of functional brain organization. Cabeza (2002) speculated that older adults use bilateral activation in the prefrontal cortex either to compensate for cognitive decline or as a result of what Baltes and Lindenberger (1997) termed dedifferentiation indicating age-related reductions in brain specialization. Monitoring CBFV during a vigilance task may provide insight into this question by determining whether older adults show an increase in overall CBFV or whether the fTCD measure reveals reduced hemispheric asymmetry during vigilance.\nThe current investigation used fTCD to examine the neurophysiological correlates in healthy old age during the performance of a vigilance task. While previous research on this subject is mixed, we predicted that young adults would outperform older adults on measures of vigilance (i.e., higher hit rate, lower false alarm rate and faster reaction time). However, we predicted that this performance difference would be reduced if older adults showed more bilateral activation as revealed by CBFV. Thus, under the HAROLD model and the resource model of vigilance, we predicted greater bilateral activation in older compared to young adults during vigilance."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "Thirty participants were recruited into the study ( Table 1) .

The critical signal for detection was the absence of a vertical 1 mm black line intersecting the 6 o'clock position within one of the five circles in the display. This display was chosen because of previous research that has shown that it exhibits appropriate psychometric properties and is of sufficient difficulty to influence performance (Finomore et al., 2006; Shaw et al., 2016 ). An example of the stimulus array is presented in the center panel in Figure 1 . Prior to engaging in the actual vigilance testing session, all participants were given a brief practice session. The practice consisted of 75 trials, five critical (one for each position) and 70 neutral with auditory performance feedback (i.e., ''hit'', ''miss'', or ''false''). The experimental test session consisted of six blocks of 150 trials, 10 critical (2 per position) and 140 neutral, without auditory feedback. Each trial consisted of a blank screen (2250 ms), followed by the stimulus (250 ms, with neutral or critical), a blank response screen (1500 ms) for a total of 4 s per trial. The entire vigilance task lasted for 60 min.\nEvents were presented serially, and the display was updated once every 4 s, resulting in an event rate of 15 events/min. All stimuli were exposed for 0.25 s. For each observer, critical signals came into view on an average of once per minute during each period of watch (signal probability = 0.067) and the signals appeared equally often on each of the five circles comprising the vigilance display.

After a short verbal description of the experiment, participants read and signed the consent form, and filled out a biographical questionnaire. Older participants were then administered the MMSE. Participants were then fitted with the fTCD sensors. Prior to the vigilance practice session, participants were linked to a fTCD unit (Spencer Technologies model PMD150). The unit is equipped with two 2 MHz pulsed transducers embedded in a plastic bracket that is secured around the head with an adjustable Velcro strap. Both the left and right transducers were placed along the temporal bone dorsal and immediately proximal to the zygomatic arch. Ultrasound transmission gel was placed between each TCD transducer and the participant's skin to obtain a clear ultrasound signal. CBFV was measured from the mainstream MCA for the left and right cerebral hemispheres and provided a reading in cm/s. The MCA was monitored at approximate depths of 50-55 mm. The MCA is the artery most often measured in vigilance studies, as it supplies about 80% of the blood to the brain (Stroobant and Vingerhoets, 2000) . A baseline was acquired by having the participant stare at a blank screen for 5 min. Blood flow data for the last 60 s of the baseline period was used as the baseline index, consistent with previous research (Aaslid, 1986; Shaw et al., 2009) . Subjects wore the TCD headset for the duration of the experiment.\nNext, the participant completed a short practice of the main vigilance task. In order to be retained in the vigilance experiment, the participant was required to have scored 80% or higher on hits and commit no more than 10% false alarms. If necessary, participants completed a second practice. Two participants required a second practice, while five participants were unable to meet this inclusion criterion and were therefore excluded from the experiment. Participants that did meet the practice criterion went on to complete the test trials of the vigilance task which lasted 60 min. After completion, the fTCD sensors were removed and the participant was given a 5-min break prior to the cognitive assessment.\nFor the cognitive assessment, the participant was first administered the WMSi (\u223c3 min). Next, they completed the EF task (\u223c 15 min) and the CVS task (\u223c15 min), in counterbalanced order. The participant was then read the recall directions of the delayed WMS (WMSd). Finally, the participant was thanked for his or her participation and the researcher provided a synopsis of the goals of the study and answered any questions. The younger participants were provided course credit and the older participants were offered ten dollars for travel compensation. The entire duration of the experiment was approximately 120 min. Data for the vigilance task and CBFV were examined using mixed-model analysis of variance (ANOVAs). Data for the Cognitive Assessment were analyzed using a MANOVA. Table 1 shows that older adults on average scored 29 out of 30 on the MMSE (the lowest score was 26).

Follow-up univariate analyses revealed that older adults had higher rates of immediate and delayed recall in the WMSi (F (1,28) = 6.288, p < 0.05, \u03b7 2 = 0.183) and WMSd (F (1,28) = 7.570, p = 0.01, \u03b7 2 = 0.183) memory tests.

The correlation was not significant (p > 0.05)."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "To test our hypothesis that having more resources committed to a vigilance task heightens performance regardless of age, we used CBFV to measure resources during vigilance in young and older people. Previous work has shown that task-related brain activation is more bilateral in healthy older people compared to young people. This bilateral activation has been linked to a compensatory mechanism for poorer cognitive performance (reviewed in Greenwood, 2007) . Based on evidence that: (a) in young people vigilance performance is improved in groups who activate CBFV bilaterally (Shaw et al., 2016) ; and (b) high-but not low-functioning older people showed a bilateral activation pattern , we predicted that healthy older people would experience a benefit in vigilance performance from bilateral activation. Consistent with previous findings (Rogers, 2000; Warm et al., 2008) , we found the young group showed stronger right than left hemisphere activation during vigilance. Although the healthy, cognitively normal (Table 1) older group showed bilateral activation, they also showed poorer vigilance performance than the young adults. These findings are relevant to several questions.\nFirst, we found that older people did not perform as well as young on vigilance tasks. While the literature does not consistently show that vigilance is age sensitive (reviewed in Giambra, 1997) , our study is consistent with such a conclusion. This is an important matter in light of the growing presence of retirement-aged people in the workforce, including in vigilance assignments relevant to public safety. Second, our findings are relevant to the debate on whether increased regional activation in older people is related to a compensatory process. Beginning with the work of Grady et al. (1994 Grady et al. ( , 2005 , it has been found that tasks that induce unilateral hemispheric activation in young people instead induce bilateral activation in older people. Such evidence is the basis for the HAROLD hypothesis which argues that the decreased lateralization seen in older adults reflects either compensation or dedifferentiation (Cabeza, 2002) . Greenwood (2007) hypothesized that in aging, functional plasticity leads to changed processing strategy which increases activation of atrophic regions (prefrontal and parietal) and thereby improves performance. Consistent with that, there is recent evidence of ''compensation by recruitment'' in older people in memory processes (Lighthall et al., 2014; Kennedy et al., 2015; Fern\u00e1ndez-Cabello et al., 2016) , with confirmation by meta-analyses (Spreng et al., 2010; Maillet and Rajah, 2014) . Although we did observe increased activation of frontal regions among the older people, that bilateral activation occurred together with poorer vigilance performance. Therefore, if the increased activation of the left hemisphere was compensatory, that compensation was not sufficient to raise the performance of the healthy old to the level of the young. Thus, our results from a vigilance task do not support the idea of ''compensation by recruitment'' in aging. However, there is previous evidence that compensation by recruitment occurs in young extraverts during vigilance performance (Shaw et al., 2016) . Our findings that the older group showed more bilateral activation but poorer performance relative to the young group is consistent with dedifferentiation theory (Baltes and Lindenberger, 1997) . That view predicts that age-related loss of regional brain specificity reflected in bilateral processing is accompanied by poorer performance. The hypothesis of dedifferentiation does not predict compensation. However, more recent hypotheses of brain aging have predicted it. First, Greenwood (2007) argued from the paradoxically increased activation of brain regions known to shrink with age that age-related reductions in regional brain integrity drives both changes in processing strategy and functional cortical reorganization. Subsequently, Park and Reuter-Lorenz (2009) advanced a very similar view, termed ''scaffolding theory.'' The present study did not find evidence that the observed bilateral activation in the older group had compensatory effects. Considering the existing evidence together, it appears that compensation by recruitment can occur in both young and older people. Nevertheless, our results showed that for vigilance tasks, bilateral recruitment may be relatively ineffective in ameliorating the performance of older people.\nThird, our findings add to the literature reporting variability in the strength of the vigilance decrement. We did not see a traditional vigilance decrement in performance sensitivity. One explanation could have been the relatively slow event rate (15 events/min). Event rate has been found to be a primary determinant of the vigilance decrement, such that slow event rates (e.g., 5 events/min) are not as resource demanding as faster event rates (30 events/min; Parasuraman and Davies, 1977) . Indeed, the performance difference between older and younger adults was restricted to an overall difference in perceptual sensitivity. It is worth noting, though, that a significant slowing of reaction time was observed in the study, and there was a marginally significant main effect that points to more slowing in the older group. So, while both groups were able to maintain their detection performance over time, both older and younger adults slowed in their response over the course of the vigil, which could be evidence of the decrement function.\nOur findings raise the question of whether, in light of public safety concerns, age alone is a sufficient predictor of vigilance performance in the real world. In a study that compared high-and low-cognitive functioning older adults, only the high-functioning group showed bilateral activation pattern . This suggests the importance of understanding the effect of overall cognitive functioning on the ability to compensate by recruitment. It will be important for future research to compare higher-and lower-functioning older adults for the ability to compensate for cognitive decline. A study of this sort is especially relevant given the relatively recent findings relating to increased ''brain reserve'' among older adults, in which older adults that engage in demanding cognitive and motor activities seem to show strengthened brain machinery (Freret et al., 2015) .\nIt will also be important for future research to consider other sources of individual differences in vigilance performance and neurophysiological response. Shaw and colleagues (Shaw et al., 2010; Matthews et al., 2011 Matthews et al., , 2014 have shown the importance of linking operator characteristics to neurophysiological measures to gain insight into how individual differences affect resource allocation strategies. Recent research in this vein has considered a wide variety of operator characteristics such as extraversion (Shaw et al., 2010 (Shaw et al., , 2016 , neuroticism (Mandell et al., 2015) , impulsivity (Shaw et al., 2010) and experience (Shaw et al., 2013b) . This work reveals individual differences in both vigilance performance and hemispheric activation patterns. Although this suggests there may be some ability to compensate to maintain vigilance, the effect may be fragile or dependent upon a combination of multiple factors that were not considered in this study."}, {"section_title": "ETHICS STATEMENT", "text": "This study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations of Human Subjects SOPs, Office of Research Integrity and Assurance's Institutional Review Board with written informed consent from all subjects.
