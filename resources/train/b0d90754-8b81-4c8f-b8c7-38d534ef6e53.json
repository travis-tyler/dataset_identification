[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract: This report describes a pilot study to evaluate feasibility of new home-based assessment technologies applicable to clinical trials for prevention of cognitive loss and Alzheimer disease. Methods: Community-dwelling nondemented individuals Z75 years old were recruited and randomized to 1 of 3 assessment methodologies: (1) mail-in questionnaire/ live telephone interviews (MIP); (2) automated telephone with interactive voice recognition (IVR); and (3) internet-based computer Kiosk (KIO). Brief versions of cognitive and noncognitive outcomes were adapted to the different methodologies and administered at baseline and 1-month. An Efficiency measure, consisting of direct staffto-participant time required to complete assessments, was also compared across arms. Results: Forty-eight out of 60 screened participants were randomized. The dropout rate across arms from randomization through 1-month was different: 33% for KIO, 25% for IVR, and 0% for MIP (Fisher Exact Test P = 0.04). Nearly all participants who completed baseline also completed 1-month assessment (38 out of 39). The 1-way ANOVA across arms for total staff-to-participant direct contact time (ie, training, baseline, and 1-month) was significant: F (2,33) = 4.588; P = 0.017, with lowest overall direct time in minutes for IVR (Mn = 44.4; SD = 21.5), followed by MIP (Mn = 74.9; SD = 29.9), followed by KIO (Mn = 129.4; SD = 117.0). Conclusions: In this sample of older individuals, a higher dropout rate occurred in those assigned to the high-technology assessment techniques; however, once participants had completed baseline in all 3 arms, they continued participation through 1 month. High-technology home-based assessment methods, which do not require live testers, began to emerge as more time-efficient over the brief time of this pilot, despite initial time-intensive participant training.\nKey Words: alzheimer disease, prevention trials, home-based assessment (Alzheimer Dis Assoc Disord 2010;24:256-263) M ajor challenges exist for conducting Alzheimer disease (AD) primary prevention trials in recruitment and retention of elderly cohorts and evaluating them over extended periods of time. First, elderly populations often present with a range of physical, social, and health issues, which limit study participation, particularly when a clinical site is geographically remote. Second, identifying a target population for a clinical trial within a general medical setting requires establishing operational study criteria and diagnostic categories at entry to classify homogeneous subgroups of participants with or without memory deficits or other forms of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Third, assessment batteries need to be developed that are: sensitive to change over time; have sufficient breadth to tap key domains that mark transition from cognitive health to dementia; and suitable for large-scale administration.\nThis report describes a pilot study in which we incorporated the cognitive and noncognitive domains that Ferris et al 1 identified as important to characterizing the transition to dementia. Our goal was to adapt these assessment measures to a home-based longitudinal study of a population of community-dwelling elderly people, using technologies that reduce the need for face-to-face assessment and participant travel. If such home-based assessment is feasible, it would allow a potentially larger and broader sampling of individuals to participate in studies.\nThis study included screening procedures to identify nondemented elders, categorizing them as having normal cognition or MCI by a battery of well-established in-person neuropsychologic measures. 3, 4 Participants were then randomly assigned to 1 of 3 experimental methods of homebased longitudinal assessment: (1) mail-in/phone (MIP): A validated cognitive assessment was conducted by phone with a live, trained tester, supplemented by written mail-in questionnaires assessing noncognitive domains; (2) assessment and data collection through telephone-based automated interactive voice response (IVR) 5-7 for all cognitive and noncognitive measures (no live tester); and (3) computer-based, video-directed assessment, and data collection through kiosk (KIO) (no live tester). Abbreviated versions of cognitive and noncognitive measures from key domains associated with change from nondemented to MCI and dementia were administered in formats specific to the technology of experimental method of assessment.\nIn addition, medication adherence to a twice-daily vitamin regimen, a performance-based instrumental activity of daily living, was assessed by methods specific to each technology arm.\nThe study was conducted by the Alzheimer Disease Cooperative Study (ADCS), a national consortium of sites with expertise in the conduct of clinical trials in cognitive loss and dementia. 8 The purpose of this pilot study was to"}, {"section_title": "M", "text": "ajor challenges exist for conducting Alzheimer disease (AD) primary prevention trials in recruitment and retention of elderly cohorts and evaluating them over extended periods of time.

The 48 randomized participants were distributed as: MIP n = 14; IVR n = 16; and KIO n = 18. Nine of the 48 randomized participants discontinued before baseline: 6 from KIO (33%), 3 from IVR (19%). Five of the 6 participants who discontinued from KIO reported reasons specific to that arm's technology: for example, ''too much trouble getting broadband internet.'' Two of the 3 IVR participants who discontinued were described as ''unable to complete the baseline.'' The others withdrew with no specific comment recorded.

These difficulties included: delays in broadband installation; difficulty installing speakers; need to permit remote access and multiple computer access for the participant; insufficient power from the MedTracker battery pack; and need for real-time assistance for computer installation. This technical assistance was not captured in the Efficiency measures, which focused exclusively on contacts that staff made directly with participants.

The cohort was quite old, with a mean age above 80, and nearly 70% reported cardiovascular conditions, thereby showing that an ''at risk'' population can be recruited. Randomization into the novel technology arms (KIO and IVR) was associated with an increased likelihood of discontinuation and dropout before baseline; participants assigned to KIO in particular cited the inconvenience of the technology. This finding points to the need to vet new technologies fully with real-life experience before deploying them to home use. It is noteworthy that once participants were familiarized with study procedures (ie, completing baseline) they remained engaged, as supported by the over 90% retention from baseline to 1-month follow-up across all arms.\nObjective findings corroborate subjective accounts of greater difficulty with the initiation of the novel, automated methods, and particular difficulty with the KIO installation. The staff time was greater for the KIO arm, particularly during training and baseline data collection, and did not include the additional time for installation or the ''real time'' technical assistance for computer trouble-shooting. Nevertheless, the staff-time at startup for the new technologies resulted in more efficiency over time, even over this short study. For example, when total staff time was tallied for training, baseline, and 1-month follow-up periods, the IVR was already more time efficient than the MIP arm. Given the estimate from the current pilot study that each live cognitive assessment in the MIP arm requires 22 minutes for completion, after 3 additional follow-up assessments the KIO arm would also be projected to require less staff time, assuming no additional technological problems occurred. Certainly, longer follow-up with more assessments might result in significant savings with these automated methodologies.\nThis protocol represents the first use of this cognitive battery without in-person administration. It is also the first use of the abbreviated noncognitive assessments. Data collection for all measures was nearly complete across all arms. The test-retest reliability of all experimental measures was good, supporting their stability when collected by these novel formats. There were no significant differences across the 3 arms in any of the experimental cognitive scores at 1 month, with scores from each of the 3 experimental arms comparable with in-person ''gold standard'' tests.\nMedication adherence served as a performance-based measure of ''activities of daily living'' and the data collection techniques were unique to each of the 3 technologies. Scorable data were obtained from all but 3 participants, indicating that these methods are reasonable for data collection in an elderly population. This pilot study informed the currently ongoing, much larger study designed to evaluate the sensitivity of these methods over a 4-year interval. Some of the limitations of the pilot study, such as limited diversity of race/ethnicity and levels of education, have been addressed. The main study targets participants with a diversity of demographic factors that play a role in generalizability of findings (eg, 20% minority enrollment is required at each participating site).\nThe pilot study identified the gap between the relatively high initial enthusiasm for higher technologies (such as computers) and the reluctance to fully participate once randomized. The pilot study also identified the fear of the size and inconvenience of internet-based technologies and prompted us to develop strategies to address these concerns. For example, computer Kiosks delivered in shipping cartons intimidated potential participants with small living quarters, and delivery of uncrated computers helped alleviate this concern. Providing companionship while service people installed cable connections overcame anxiety about having a ''stranger'' in the home. ''Real time'' help lines for local site staff for installation problems allowed the participant to see the technical issues as manageable.\nThe most encouraging finding was the evidence that efforts early in the trial had long-lasting benefits in terms of participation and follow-up. The main study will provide larger sample sizes in which we will be able to evaluate and compare methods for efficiency and accuracy in early detection of cognitive deterioration and dementia. zAll correlations were significant between baseline and 1-mo scores (N = 38) at P values <0.001. yKIO N = 11 at baseline and 1-Mo. for TICS."}]
