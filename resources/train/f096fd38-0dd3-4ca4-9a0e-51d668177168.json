[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract Plasma levels of insulin-like growth factor binding protein-2 (IGFBP-2) have been associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and brain atrophy. Some evidence suggests a potential synergistic effect of IGFBP-2 and AD neuropathology on neurodegeneration, while other evidence suggests the effect of IGFBP-2 on neurodegeneration is independent of AD neuropathology. Therefore, the current study investigated the interaction between plasma IGFBP-2 and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of AD neuropathology on hippocampal volume and cognitive function. AD Neuroimaging Initiative data were accessed (n = 354, 75 \u00b1 7 years, 38 % female), including plasma IGFBP-2, CSF total tau, CSF A\u03b2-42, MRI-quantified hippocampal volume, and neuropsychological performances. Mixed effects regression models evaluated the interaction between IGFBP-2 and AD biomarkers on hippocampal volume and neuropsychological performance, adjusting for age, sex, education, APOE \u03b54 status, and cognitive diagnosis. A baseline interaction between IGFBP-2 and CSF A\u03b2-42 was observed in relation to left (t(305) = \u22126.37, p = 0.002) and right hippocampal volume (t(305) = \u22127.74, p = 0.001). In both cases, higher IGFBP-2 levels were associated with smaller hippocampal volumes but only among amyloid negative individuals. The observed interaction suggests IGFBP-2 drives neurodegeneration through a separate pathway independent of AD neuropathology."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The most common neuropathological presentation of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a mixed pathology which includes plaques, tangles, and cerebrovascular disease (Schneider et al. 2007; Schneider and Bennett 2010; Troncoso et al. 2008) . Thus, it is not surprising that vascular risk factors have been associated with incident AD (Kivipelto et al. 2002) and type-2 diabetes in particular has been associated with a two-fold higher risk of incident AD (Sims-Robinson et al. 2010) . There is some evidence that diabetes may have a direct effect on the AD neuropathological cascade. Multiple interacting pathways between insulin signaling and AD neuropathology have been identified, including insulin-related alterations in glycogen synthase kinase 3 (a known tau kinase) and insulin-related alterations Data used in preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu). As such, the investigators within the ADNI contributed to design and implementation of ADNI and/or provided data but did not participate in analysis or writing of this report. A complete listing of ADNI investigators can be found at: http://adni.loni.usc.edu/wpcontent/uploads/how_to_apply/ADNI_Acknowledgement_List.pdf in amyloid clearance via insulin degrading enzyme (for review see Stanley et al. 2016) . Moreover, insulin and its receptors are highly expressed in brain regions relevant to AD pathogenesis, including the medial temporal lobe, and play an important role in episodic memory functioning (McNay and Recknagel 2011) , suggesting that insulin abnormalities may be particularly damaging in the presence of co-occurring AD neuropathology. Yet, other findings suggest diabetes and insulin abnormalities drive neurodegeneration through an independent pathway. Autopsy findings, for example, indicate that the increased risk of clinical AD associated with type-2 diabetes is driven by cerebrovascular pathology rather than amyloid plaques or tau tangles (Abner et al. 2016; Ahtiluoto et al. 2010; Arvanitakis et al. 2006) .\nOne pathway implicated in the interaction between insulin and AD neuropathology is the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling pathway (Laviola et al. 2007 ). This pathway includes IGFs, IGF receptors, and IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs). IGFs promote hippocampal survival in the presence of neurotoxins (Dore et al. 1997) , including the amyloid-\u03b2 peptide (Wei et al. 2002) . However, IGFBPs restrict the availability of IGFs, reducing their neuroprotective effects (Mackay et al. 2003) . Peripheral levels of both IGF-1 (Westwood et al. 2014 ) and IGFBP-2 (Doecke et al. 2012 ) have been associated with an increased risk of clinical AD. Additionally, there is growing evidence that of the six high-affinity IGF-binding proteins, IGFBP-2 may have a specific role in AD pathophysiology. Individuals with AD have elevated levels of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma IGFBP-2 compared to cognitively normal older adults (Doecke et al. 2012; Hu et al. 2012; O'Bryant et al. 2010; Toledo et al. 2013) , and plasma levels of IGFBP-2 are associated with a pronounced AD-like pattern of brain atrophy (Toledo et al. 2013 ). In the context of such neurodegeneration, Toledo et al. 2013 noted that plasma IGFBP-2 levels correlate with CSF total tau levels; thus IGFBP-2 may drive neurodegeneration by exacerbating IGF-1 signaling defects among individuals with AD neuropathology. However, a second alternative hypothesis is that the role of IGFBP-2 does not depend on the presence of AD neuropathology per se, but rather promotes neurodegeneration through a non-AD neurotrophic signaling pathway.\nThe current study will therefore assess the potential synergistic effect of plasma IGFBP-2 levels and CSF biomarkers of AD neuropathology. First, we extend previous work (e.g., Toledo et al. 2013) by assessing the association between IGFBP-2 and AD-relevant outcomes, including hippocampal volume, episodic memory function, and executive function. Second, we assess the interaction between CSF biomarkers of AD neuropathology and IGFBP-2 on these same AD-relevant outcomes. We hypothesize that, similar to effect of vascular risk factors (Hohman et al. 2015) , IGFBP-2 acts through a non-AD pathway and thus will show the strongest association with hippocampal volume, episodic memory performance, and executive function performance among biomarker negative individuals. Data for the present study were accessed on 06/01/2015 and limited to ADNI 1 cohort participants with available structural 1.5 T neuroimaging, plasma IGFBP-2 and CSF IGFBP-2, CSF AD biomarker, and neuropsychological data.

The number of analytes in each panel is limited by dynamic range, matrix interference, and cross-reactivity, and the actual combination of analytes in a panel is proprietary to RBM. Each plate is run in triplicate to ensure high quality results.

The IGFBP-2 assay has a least detectable dose of 1.2 ng/mL and a lower assay limit of 0.27 ng/mL. The least detectable dose is considered the lowest reliable level for the assay, and anything lower is associated with greater error. All IGFBP-2 levels were greater than the least detectable dose (1.48-2.56 ng/mL).

We observed an interaction between plasma IGFBP-2 and CSF A\u03b2-42 on left and right hippocampal volume at baseline whereby high IGFBP-2 levels were associated with smaller hippocampal volumes among amyloid negative individuals. Our results suggest that the neurodegenerative effects of IGFBP-2 may act through an independent, non-amyloid pathway.\nThe present results have important clinical implications, as findings highlight the effect of IGFBP signaling among amyloid negative individuals. In previous work leveraging both ADNI data and autopsy data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC), we observed a comparable interaction between the Framingham Stroke Risk Profile and CSF biomarkers of AD neuropathology whereby the effect of vascular risk on hippocampal volume and cognition was strongest among individuals who were AD biomarker negative (Hohman et al. 2015) . The results of both the current and previous work support the possibility that vascular and insulin interventions for cognitive impairment may be most beneficial among individuals who are AD biomarker negative.\nThe mechanism underlying the observed IGFBP-2 effect remains somewhat unclear. Among the 6 known IGF binding proteins, IGFBP-2 is the most abundant in the brain (Hertze et al. 2014) and has an active role in neural development and neuroprotection through IGF signaling. The lack of an association between IGFBP-2 and hippocampal volume among amyloid positive individuals suggests that any neuroprotective effects of IGFBP-2 may be overwhelmed by the neurodegenerative effects of AD neuropathology. Unfortunately, the present project was unable to evaluate IGF-1 or IGF-2 signaling that likely partially or fully mediates the effects of IGFBP-2 on neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. There is evidence that the neurotrophic effects of IGFs protect neurons (Dore et al. 1997) , so without direct measurement of IGF it remains possible that interactions between IGFs and amyloid result in an altered or reduced effect of IGFBP-2 in the presence of high levels of amyloid. Co-measurement of peripheral and central levels of IGFs and IGFBPs will be necessary to further elucidate the mechanisms of the interactions observed in the current study.\nIn contrast to previous reports (Hertze et al. 2014; Hu et al. 2012; Tham et al. 1993) , we observed higher plasma IGFBP-2 levels in individuals with MCI compared to those with NC and AD. Previous analyses did not assess MCI or collapsed MCI and AD into a single group, so it is unknown whether the diagnostic group differences seen here were similarly present in these previous cohorts. A second possibility is that, due to eligibility restrictions limiting overt cerebrovascular disease in the ADNI cohort, the sample of AD patients here underrepresents the prevalence of co-occurring cerebrovascular disease that likely underlies previously observed IGFBP-2 effects. Such a selection bias may also reduce our ability to detect IGFBP-2 effects within amyloid positive participants, leaving open the possibility of a synergistic effect between IGFBP-2 and AD biomarkers on neurodegeneration within more representative cohorts.\nThe current study has a number of strengths. First, by utilizing the ADNI cohort, we had access to a number of factors that could be related to IGFBP-2, including a well characterized cohort of participants, plasma and CSF markers of IGFBP-2 and CSF biomarkers of AD, neuroimaging variables, and cognitive assessments. Few other cohorts would allow for such an in-depth assessment of a single factor in human models. Additionally, we were able to expand upon prior work (Royall et al. 2015; Toledo et al. 2013 ) and demonstrate an important interaction between IGFBP-2 and AD biomarkers. Despite these strengths, there are a few weaknesses related to the current study. First, the generalizability of the ADNI cohort is limited given the predominantly Caucasian and welleducated participant sample. Second, ADNI's methodological design was intended to support therapeutic discovery and the absence of repeat CSF or plasma IGFBP-2 levels precluded examination of longitudinal changes in IGFBP-2. It is important for future work to investigate such longitudinal associations to characterize relations between IGFBP-2 and brain aging.\nIn conclusion, our results demonstrate that IGFBP-2 levels are related to neurodegeneration, particularly among amyloid negative individuals. IGFBP-2 may therefore be an important factor in predicting neurodegeneration through one or more non-AD pathological pathways. Grey shading represents the 95 % confidence intervals. There is a negative association between increasing levels of IGFBP-2 and hippocampal volume among amyloid negative individuals. Amyloid groupings are for illustration purposes only"}]
