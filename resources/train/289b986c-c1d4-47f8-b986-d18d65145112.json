[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Cancer rates vary by many different characteristics, including geographic classifications such as county of residence. County populations differ from one another on the basis of demographic, environmental, economic, and social characteristics, which might influence the magnitude and types of health problems, including cancer (1) . Counties can be classified as metropolitan or nonmetropolitan as defined by the Office of Management and Budget (2) . This classification scheme can be further categorized by using the U.S. Department of Agriculture Economic Research Service (USDA ERS) rural-urban continuum codes classification scheme, which categorizes metropolitan counties by the population size of their metropolitan area and nonmetropolitan counties by degree of urbanization and adjacency to a metropolitan area (3) . Previous research indicates that although cancer death rates decreased from 1999 to 2014 among all counties, decreases were slower in nonmetropolitan areas than metropolitan areas, increasing disparities (1) . Comparisons of cancer death rates in nonmetropolitan areas and metropolitan areas have been described previously but not systematically assessed (1, 4) .\nThe Healthy People 2020 initiative established a set of goals and objectives designed to improve the health of the U.S. population, recognizing the important role played by determinants of health, such as geographic location (5) . As of 2017, Healthy People 2020 includes objectives for reducing ageadjusted overall cancer death rates to 161.4 deaths per 100,000 persons, lung cancer to 45.5 deaths per 100,000 persons, female breast cancer to 20.7 deaths per 100,000 females, cervical cancer to 2.2 deaths per 100,000 females, colorectal cancer to 14.5 deaths per 100,000 persons, oral cavity and pharynx cancer to 2.3 deaths per 100,000 persons, prostate cancer to 21.8 deaths per 100,000 males, and melanoma to 2.4 deaths per 100,000 persons (5) . Healthy People 2020 also includes objectives to reduce age-adjusted incidence rates of colorectal cancer to 39.9 cases per 100,000 persons, late-stage breast cancer to 42.2 cases per 100,000 females, and cervical cancer to 7.3 cases per 100,000 females (5) .\nThis report assesses differences in cancer incidence and death rates by county classification, age group, sex, race/ethnicity, U.S. census region, and cancer type (and stage for incidence of cancers that are detectable by screening), as well as changes over time in incidence and death rates for common cancers in nonmetropolitan and metropolitan counties and whether these trends differ. In addition, this report assesses progress toward reaching the Healthy People 2020 objectives for cancer (5) .

This report presents average annual age-adjusted rates for the most recent 5-year period with available data (2009-2013 for incidence and 2011-2015 for deaths) and trends in annual age-adjusted incidence rates for the most recent 10-year period with available data (2004-2013 for incidence and 2006-2015 for deaths). For 5-year average annual rates, counties were classified into four categories (nonmetropolitan rural, nonmetropolitan urban, metropolitan with population <1 million, and metropolitan with population \u22651 million).

By risk factor, the study found that adults who lived in rural areas had the lowest prevalence of current nonsmoking (i.e., the highest prevalence of current smoking), maintaining normal body weight (i.e., the highest prevalence of being overweight or obese), and meeting aerobic leisure-time physical activity recommendations (i.e., the highest prevalence of not getting enough physical activity), each of which is associated with increased cancer risk but the highest prevalence of nondrinking or moderate drinking, which could be associated with reduced cancer risk (10) .\nCertain cancer risk factors can be addressed through clinical preventive services. As of 2017, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force has recommended that all adults be screened for tobacco use and excessive alcohol use and offered counseling and intervention as needed and recommended the use of low-dose aspirin to prevent colorectal cancer and cardiovascular disease among adults who are considered to be at high risk for cardiovascular disease based on specific criteria (https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/ Name/recommendations). A higher percentage of residents in nonmetropolitan areas than in metropolitan areas was uninsured (11) , potentially limiting access to preventive services covered by insurance. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends vaccination against two cancer-causing viruses, HPV (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/ vacc-specific/hpv.html) and hepatitis B virus (https://www. cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/vacc-specific/hepb.html). Data from the 2014 National Immunization Survey among persons aged 13-17 years indicate that vaccination rates for hepatitis B were similar in nonmetropolitan and metropolitan counties but that the vaccination rates for HPV among both boys and girls were lower in nonmetropolitan counties than in metropolitan counties (11) .\nIn addition, disparities could be attributed to differences in adherence to screening guidelines. As of 2017, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force has recommended populationbased screening for colorectal, female breast, and cervical cancers among persons at average risk and for lung cancer in persons at high risk (https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/ Name/recommendations). Cancer screening is an important aspect of cancer prevention and control because screening can prevent cancer by finding and treating precancerous changes before they progress to cancer, and screening can control cancer by detecting tumors at the earliest stages when they are most treatable. Cervical and colorectal cancer screening tests can detect both precancerous lesions and cancer at an early stage, thus preventing both cancer occurrence and cancer death; breast and lung cancer screening tests can detect cancer at an early stage, thus reducing cancer deaths, although they do not prevent cancer from developing. Data from the 2010 National Health Interview Survey indicated that rates of breast and cervical cancer screening were similar in metropolitan and nonmetropolitan counties but that colorectal cancer screening rates were lower in nonmetropolitan counties (12) . Increased use of cancer screening might reduce rates of latestage cancer; data from this report indicate that, compared with metropolitan counties, nonmetropolitan counties generally had higher rates of and slower decreases in late-stage lung cancer and late-stage colorectal cancer but similar rates of late-stage cervical cancer and lower rates of late-stage breast cancer. The data in this report also indicate that nonmetropolitan counties experienced higher death rates from colorectal and cervical cancer. Higher death rates might reflect lack of access to cancer screening services, follow-up to abnormal tests, quality care for cancer patients, and cancer survival care (4)."}, {"section_title": "Evidence-Based Interventions", "text": "An important component of cancer prevention and control is implementation of interventions at both the individual level and the population level (13) . Interventions can be implemented to reduce cancer risk factors, particularly tobacco use, secondhand smoke exposure, alcohol use, and excessive exposure to ultraviolet rays from the sun and tanning beds, and to promote protective factors such as vaccination against cancer-related infectious diseases including HPV and hepatitis B virus, getting enough physical activity, and maintaining a healthy weight. Program and policy interventions proven to increase cancer screening and vaccination rates and to prevent tobacco use, excessive alcohol use, obesity, and physical inactivity have been reviewed and evaluated in The Guide to Community Preventive Services (https://www.thecommunityguide.org). The CDC's National Comprehensive Cancer Control Program brings together diverse partners to plan, implement, and evaluate these interventions in their own communities (https://www. cdc.gov/cancer/ncccp).\nCDC also supports the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program, which addresses health disparities among women who are uninsured or underinsured, a common characteristic in rural populations (https://www. cdc.gov/cancer/nbccedp). Although this program has focused on direct screening services, emphasis is shifting toward population-based interventions, similar to those used by the Colorectal Cancer Control Program (https://www.cdc.gov/ cancer/crccp). The goal is to work with health care systems, health care payers, health care purchasers, and other partners to implement interventions that address barriers such as providing transportation assistance, having clinics with modified hours, and providing assessment and feedback reports on clinical practice performance.

Regarding objectives for incidence, the objective for colorectal cancer was met in metropolitan counties with <1 million population, and the objective for late-stage breast cancer incidence was met in nonmetropolitan rural and urban counties.

These disparities indicate that not all persons are benefitting equally from initiatives to achieve Healthy People 2020 objectives and that more work is needed to meet these objectives.

Finally, this report used the most recent data available, through 2013 for incidence data and 2015 for mortality data; caution should be used when comparing incidence and death rates because of the difference in years and population coverage."}, {"section_title": "Future Directions", "text": "This report demonstrates the value of examining cancer incidence and death rates among nonmetropolitan and metropolitan area by cancer type. Examination of county-level patterns within states might be helpful in determining areas with disproportionately high cancer incidence or death rates. Using tools such as State Cancer Profiles (https://statecancerprofiles. cancer.gov) might help identify prevalence of risk factors and use of screening tests that might affect these rates."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Although nonmetropolitan rural counties had a lower incidence of cancer overall, the incidence of certain cancers, including lung cancer, was higher, as was overall cancer mortality. Many cancers are linked to modifiable risk factors, such as tobacco use, and use of cancer screening tests. Evidencebased strategies to improve health-related behaviors, use of vaccinations that prevent infections with cancer-causing viruses, and use of cancer screening tests, particularly among persons who live in nonmetropolitan rural and urban counties, might help achieve Healthy People 2020 objectives to reduce cancer morbidity and mortality."}]
