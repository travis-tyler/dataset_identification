This survey began in 1995-96 with a nationally representative sample of approximately 12,000 first-time students who enrolled in postsecondary education in 1995-96. These students were interviewed again in 1998 and, for the last time, in 2001, about 6 years after their initial college entry. The longitudinal design of BPS permits examination of student entrance, persistence, and attainment in STEM fields over the period of time in which most students complete a bache-1 This definition draws upon longitudinal data available through BPS:96/01, but it has limitations. BPS:96/01 did not collect comprehensive historical data on students' major field during their enrollment between 1995-96 and 2001. Rather, data on students' major were collected at each data collection point: 1995-96, 1998, and 2001. Because students could have had an unreported STEM major between the data collection points, the number of STEM entrants may be underestimated. 2 This study treated students who did not declare a major differently from those who did not report a major. The former group consisted of students who were still exploring and undecided about the field of study at the time of interview, whereas the latter group consisted of those who may have a major but declined to report it. Thus, students who did not declare a major are included in the analysis of this study, whereas students who did not report a major were treated as \"missing\" and therefore, excluded from the analysis. lor's degree. To examine students' paths to STEM degrees, this study used a sample of about 9,000 BPS students who participated in the initial survey in 1996 and the two follow-up surveys in 1998 and 2001 and who reported a major (including \"undeclared major\") in at least one of three data collections. This study also draws data from two other surveys to provide information about STEM participation among different undergraduate populations. The first is the 2003-04 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:04), a cross-sectional survey of undergraduate and graduate/first-professional students enrolled in U.S. postsecondary institutions in 2003-04. Focusing on all undergraduates (a sample of about 80,000), NPSAS:04 provides information about the prevalence of STEM majors among U.S. undergraduates in 2003-04. The second data source is the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002/06 (ELS:02/06). Unlike BPS and NPSAS, which include postsecondary students of all ages, ELS represents a more homogeneous group: high school graduates from the senior class of 2004. Using a subsample of these graduates who were enrolled in postsecondary education in 2006 (about 8,500), this study examines STEM entrance among a more traditional college-age population. For details on the BPS:96/01, NPSAS:04, and ELS:02/06 data, see the Technical Notes below. All findings reported below are descriptive and do not imply any causal relationship. All comparisons in this study were tested for statistical significance using Student's t statistic to ensure that differences were larger than might be expected due to sampling variation. All differences cited are statistically significant at the .05 level. Adjustments were not made for multiple comparisons. Consequently, some differences noted here might not be significant if a multiple comparison procedure was used.

Answers to this question depend on the undergraduate population and period of enrollment examined. Based on a nationally representative undergraduate sample from NPSAS:04, some 14 percent of all undergraduates enrolled in U.S. postsecondary institutions in 2003-04 were enrolled in a STEM field, including 5 percent in computer/information sciences, 4 percent in engineering/engineering technologies, 3 percent in biological/agricultural sciences, and less than 1 percent each in physical sciences and mathematics (table 1). Although NPSAS:04 covers undergraduates of all ages, ELS:02/06 looked at students who were of traditional college age: some 15 percent of 2003-04 high school graduates enrolled in postsecondary education in 2006 reported a STEM major. Compared to students in NPSAS:04, the traditional college-age students of ELS:02/06 enrolled in mathematics and natural sciences (including physical sciences and biological/agricultural sciences) at higher rates and enrolled in computer/ information sciences at a lower rate.  1995-96, 1998, and 2001, and students who reported a STEM major at one or more of these interview times are considered to have entered a STEM field between 1995-96 and 2001. Estimates for entering specific STEM fields do not sum to the total because some students had a major and a secondary major in different STEM fields or entered more than one STEM field during their postsecondary education. Unlike the one-time snapshots provided by NPSAS:04 and ELS:02/06, BPS:96/01 follows the enrollment of beginning postsecondary students over 6 years, thereby offering a fuller picture of STEM entrance. Based on BPS:96/01, a total of 23 percent of beginning postsecondary students entered a STEM field at some time during their postsecondary enrollment from 1995-96 to 2001 (figure 1 and table 1). Overall, 77 percent of 1995-96 beginning postsecondary students never entered a STEM field during their enrollment through 2001, including 72 percent who entered only non-STEM fields and 5 percent who never declared a major. In STEM fields, a higher percentage of students entered biological/agricultural sciences, engineering/engineering technologies, and computer/information sciences (7-8 percent) than mathematics and physical sciences (less than 2 percent for each). Students entering STEM fields had enrollment patterns different from those who did not enter STEM fields. Based on BPS:96/01, 3 52 percent of STEM entrants started their postsecondary education at a 4-year institution, compared to 38 percent of their non-STEM counterparts (table 2). Further, about one-third of STEM entrants who started in a 4-year institution (33 percent) began in a very selective institution, compared to 21 percent among their non-STEM counterparts. A higher percentage of STEM entrants started in a bachelor's degree program (48 percent vs. 35 percent) and a lower percentage attended classes exclusively part time (8 percent vs. 13 percent) when compared to their non-STEM counterparts. 1 STEM entrance is identified by students' major field as reported in 1995-96, 1998, and 2001 "}, {"section_title": "Percent", "text": "Students entering specific STEM fields generally differed from non-STEM entrants in terms of type of institution attended, degree program, and attendance, but those entering computer/information sciences were an exception.

Compared to their non-STEM counterparts, a lower percentage of students entering computer/information sciences attended classes exclusively full time and a higher percentage had mixed full-and parttime enrollment. Further, compared to students who entered natural sciences (more specifically, the physical sciences and biological/agricultural sciences), a higher percentage of students entering computer/information sciences started postsecondary education at public 2-year colleges and less selective institutions, enrolled in subbaccalaureate programs such as certificate or associate's degree programs, and attended school exclusively part time. In addition, compared to students entering mathematics and engineering/engineering technologies, those entering computer/information sciences attended 4-year institutions and enrolled in bachelor's degree programs at lower rates. 1 This variable only applies to 4-year institutions. The \"very selective\" institutions are those in which the 25th percentile of SAT/ACT scores of incoming freshman exceeded 1000.

The percentage of men entering STEM fields was higher than that of women (33 percent vs. 14 percent) (table 3), especially in the fields of mathematics, engineering/engineering technologies, and computer/ information sciences. Nearly half of Asian/Pacific Islander students (47 percent) entered STEM fields, compared to 19-23 percent of students in each of the other racial/ethnic groups. No measurable differences were found among White, Black, and Hispanic students. 4 Percentages of students entering STEM fields were higher for younger (age 19 or younger) and dependent students than for older (age 24 or older) and independent students. Compared to their U.S.-born counterparts, a higher percentage of foreign students entered STEM fields overall (34 percent vs. 22 percent), and computer/information sciences in particular (16 percent vs. 6 percent). Compared to students whose family income fell in the bottom 25 percent or whose parents had a high school education or less, a higher percentage of students from families with income in the top 25 percent or whose parents had at least some college education entered natural sciences, including the biological/ agricultural sciences and physical sciences. Various academic indicators are associated with STEM entrance as well. For example, the percentage of students entering STEM fields was higher among students who took trigonometry, precalculus, or calculus in high school; earned a grade point average (GPA) of B or higher; had college entrance exam scores in the highest quarter; and expected to attain a graduate degree in the future than among students without these characteristics. Students entering most STEM fields had similar demographic and academic characteristics, but those entering computer/information sciences were somewhat different. For example, a higher percentage of students age 30 or older, from families with income in the bottom 25 percent, and with an average high school GPA of below B entered the computer/information science fields than did students age 19 or younger, from families with income in the top 25 percent, and with an average high school GPA of B or higher."}, {"section_title": "Postsecondary Outcomes After 6 Years", "text": "Students take many different paths through postsecondary education.

The table focuses only on STEM entrants (non-STEM entrants are excluded). No gender difference was evident in persistence and attainment rates in STEM fields between 1995-96 and 2001. Some racial/ethnic differences were observed, however. Although there were no measurable differences in STEM entrance among White, Black, and Hispanic students (table 3), White students had a higher STEM bachelor's degree completion rate than did Black and Hispanic students. Asian students also had a higher STEM bachelor's degree completion rate than did Black and Hispanic students. Students' age and dependency status were not only related to STEM entrance (table 3) but also to STEM degree completion. For example, a higher percentage of students who first enrolled in postsecondary education at age 19 or younger completed a bachelor's degree in a STEM field than did those who entered at age 20 or older. Similarly, a higher percentage of dependent students than of independent students completed a STEM bachelor's degree. Differences were also observed in how students left STEM fields. In general, a higher percentage of younger (age 19 or younger) and dependent students left by changing to a non-STEM field, while a higher percentage of their older (age 20-30 or 30 years and older when first enrolled) and independent peers left postsecondary education without earning any credential. 1 This group includes students who had attained one or more degrees only in non-STEM fields and were last enrolled in a non-STEM field as of 2001, or those who had not attained a degree yet and were enrolled in a non-STEM field in 2001. 2 American Indian/Alaska Native and \"other\" students are included in the total but not presented as an individual group due to small sample sizes.

Parents' education levels were related to STEM degree attainment. The overall STEM degree completion rates as well as STEM bachelor's degree completion rates were higher among students whose parents had at least a 4year college degree than among those whose parents did not attain that level of education. In addition, a lower percentage of students whose parents had a bachelor's or higher degree left postsecondary education without earning a credential than did their counterparts whose parents did not have a bachelor's degree.

STEM entrants who started their postsecondary education in a 4-year or selective institution, who initially enrolled in a bachelor's degree program, and who attended school either exclusively full time or mixed fulland part-time attendance generally had higher STEM degree completion rates (including completing bachelor's degrees in STEM fields) than did their counterparts without these characteristics."}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "To understand who enters into and completes undergraduate programs in STEM fields, this Statistics in Brief examined data from three major national studies: the 1995-96 Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS:96/01); the 2003-04 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:04); and the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002/06 (ELS:02/06). STEM fields, as defined in this study, include mathematics, natural sciences (including physical sciences and biological/agricultural sciences), engineering/engineering technologies, and computer/information sciences. This study used students' reported major field of study to identify STEM entrants and considered a STEM entrant anyone who reported a major in a STEM field at any time during his or her postsecondary enrollment. Looking only at single points in time, STEM majors accounted for 14 percent of all undergraduates enrolled in U.S. postsecondary education in 2003-04 and 15 percent of 2003-04 high school graduates who were enrolled in postsecondary education in 2006. The STEM entrance rate increased, however, when estimated over students' postsecondary careers with longitudinal data. For example, 23 percent of 1995-96 first-time beginning postsecondary students majored in a STEM field at some point between 1995-96 and 2001. In general, the percentage of students entering STEM fields was higher among male students, younger and dependent students, Asian/Pacific Islander students, foreign students or those who spoke a language other than English as a child, and students with more advantaged family background characteristics and strong academic preparation than among their counterparts who did not have these characteristics. After 6 years of initial college enrollment, STEM entrants generally did better than non-STEM entrants in terms of bachelor's degree attainment and overall persistence. However, not all STEM entrants stayed in their fields. Roughly one-third of students who entered a STUDENTS WHO STUDY SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING, 18 AND MATHEMATICS (STEM) IN POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION STEM field during the first year switched to a non-STEM field over the next 6 years. Among all STEM entrants between 1995-96 and 2001, 53 percent persisted in a STEM field by either completing a degree in a STEM field or staying enrolled in a STEM field, and a total of 47 percent left STEM fields by either switching to a non-STEM field or leaving postsecondary education without earning any credential. STEM entrants with different characteristics had different STEM completion rates. For example, STEM bachelor's degree completion rates were higher among younger students (age 19 or younger when first enrolled in postsecondary education), White or Asian/Pacific Islander students, students with at least one parent who had a 4year college degree, and those who demonstrated a high level of academic preparation for postsecondary education, chose a 4-year or a selective institution, enrolled in a bachelor's degree program when they began college, and attended school either full time or mixed full-time with part-time attendance. Although students in various STEM fields were generally alike in terms of their demographic, academic, and enrollment characteristics and their outcomes, those entering computer/information sciences differed in many respects. According to the BPS data, older students, students from low-income families, and those less academically prepared enrolled in computer/information sciences more often than did their peers who were younger, from high-income families, or more academically prepared. Moreover, compared to other STEM students, a larger percentage of computer/information sciences majors attended public 2-year institutions, enrolled in subbaccalaureate programs, and attended classes exclusively part time. These findings are consistent with trends reported in the Digest of Education Statistics (U.S. Department of Education 2008) indicating that the number of associate's degrees awarded in computer/information sciences has increased 155 percent from 1994-95 to 2005-06, accounting for about one-third of all degrees awarded in the field of computer/information sciences in 2005-06. In the fields of biological/agricultural sciences, physical sciences, mathematics, and engineering, the number of associate's degrees accounted for 2-9 percent of all degrees awarded. In other words, more students seem to be seeking subbaccalaureate opportunities in computer/information sciences than in other STEM fields. stage sampling design was used to collect the data for NPSAS:04. The first stage involved selecting eligible institutions, and the second stage involved selecting eligible respondents within each eligible institution. More than 90,000 undergraduate, graduate, and firstprofessional students participated in the survey. Upon the completion of data collection, the weighted institutional response rate was 80 percent, and the weighted student response rate was 91 percent, resulting in an overall response rate of 72 percent.

The Education Longitudinal Study of 2002/06 (ELS:02/06) provides data about the critical transitions experienced by high school students as they proceed through high school and into postsecondary education or their early careers. Currently, this survey has four major data components: the base-year interview, the first follow-up interview, the high school transcript data collection, and the second follow-up interview. The base-year interview was carried out in a nationally representative probability sample of about 750 participating public, Catholic, and other private schools in the spring term of the 2001-02 academic year. Of about 17,600 eligible selected sophomores, about 15,400 completed a base-year questionnaire, for a weighted response rate of 87 percent. The first follow-up interview took place in the spring of 2004, when most sample members were seniors in high school. Seniors in 2004 who were not in the base-year sampling frame were eligible for selection into the sample. Of about 16,500 eligible sample members, about 15,000 participated in an interview, for a weighted response rate of 89 percent. The second follow-up interview took place in 2006, when most sample members were 2 years past high school graduation and had entered the labor force or postsecondary education. Of about 15,900 eligible sample members, about 14,200 com-pleted an interview, for a weighted response rate of 88 percent.
