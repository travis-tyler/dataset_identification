[{"section_title": "Executive Summary", "text": "The Empirical Curriculum is a descriptive account of the major features of change in student course-taking in postsecondary contexts between 1972 and 2000, with an emphasis on the period 1992-2000. To provide this account, it draws on three grade-cohort longitudinal studies that were designed and carried out by the National Center for Education Statistics, and within those studies, high school and (principally) college transcript records: \u2022 The National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972 (NLS-72), which began with a national sample of 22,500 12 th graders in U.S. high schools in the spring of 1972 and followed them to 1986. The postsecondary transcripts for 12,600 members of this cohort were gathered in 1984. \u2022 The High School and Beyond/Sophomore cohort (HS&B/So), which began with a national sample of 30,000 10 th graders in U.S. high schools in 1980, and followed sub-groups of this cohort to 1992. The postsecondary transcripts for 8,400 members of this cohort were gathered in 1993. \u2022 The National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988(NELS:88/2000, which began with a national sample of 25,000 8 th graders in U.S. schools in 1988, and followed sub-groups of this cohort to 2000. The postsecondary transcripts for 8,900 members of this cohort were gathered in 2000. To provide consistency in comparing the experience of students in the three cohorts, the populations used for the data tables in The Empirical Curriculum are confined to those students who were in the 12 th grade in the year they were scheduled to graduate from high school. This parameter was determined by the earliest of the grade cohorts, the NLS-72, which began in the 12th grade. Hence, the three cohorts are referred to throughout the document as By confining the universe to 12 th graders, high school dropouts who had not returned to be with their scheduled class and early graduates are excluded from this account of the postsecondary histories of the classes of 1982 and 1992. Two delivery themes are also evident in the list of new codes for the period 1992-2000, cooperative education/internships and independent study/undergraduate research, indicating an increase in volume of student participation in these forms of learning."}, {"section_title": "The Empirical Core Curriculum", "text": "\u2022 Taking all 12 th graders in the high school classes of 1972, 1982, and 1992 who earned bachelor's degrees, the 30 course categories producing the highest percentage of their earned credits accounted for roughly one-third of all credits earned (table 2.1)."}, {"section_title": "\u2022", "text": "Twenty-one of the 30 course categories accounting for the highest percentage of credits earned by bachelor's degree recipients from the high school classes of 1972, 1982, and 1992 were the same in all three grade cohorts (table 2.1 and figure 2.1).\nFourteen of the 30 course categories accounting for the highest percentage of credits earned by bachelor's degree recipients from the high school classes of 1982 and 1992 were common to all four of the major race/ethnicity groups in both cohorts, and another 8 course categories were common to three of the four race/ethnicity groups (table 2.3).\nSixteen of the 30 course categories accounting for the highest percentage of credits earned by bachelor's degree recipients from the high school classes of 1982 and 1992 were held in common by men and women in both cohorts (tables 2.4 and 2.5).\nOnly 12 of the 30 course categories accounting for the highest percentage of credits earned by bachelor's degree recipients from the high school class of 1992 were held in common by three levels of selectivity of the institution awarding the bachelor's degree (table 2.7). This framework of analysis yields a higher degree of differentiation in the empirical core curriculum than those frameworks that draw on demographic constructs.\nDeclining percentages in participation from the 1972-1980 to the 1982-1990 period, followed by rising percentages for the 1992-2000 period, can be observed in 8 of the course codes for Education, reflecting the change in the proportion of undergraduates majoring in Education in the three grade cohorts (table 3.1 and table 2.2).\nRising percentages in participation from the 1972-1980 to the 1982-1990 period, followed by falling percentages for the 1992-2000 period can be observed in 11 of the codes in Business Administration, reflecting the change in the proportion of undergraduates majoring in business fields (tables 3.1 and 2.2).\nThe 10 course categories with the highest average number of credits earned by 1992 12 th graders who subsequently earned more than 10 postsecondary credits are Student Teaching (9.9 credits); Advanced Accounting, which includes auditing and cost accounting (8.3 credits); Music Performance (7.4 credits); introductory and intermediate level Spanish (7.3 credits); Organic Chemistry (6.9 credits); introductory and intermediate level French (6.8 credits); Calculus (6.6 credits); General Physics (6.6 credits); General Chemistry (6.5 credits); and Theater: Acting, Directing (6.3 credits) (table 3.2). These cases reflect either categories in which students take courses more than once (in the performing arts), categories in which courses are presented in multi-term form (in the sciences, mathematics, and foreign languages), or categories that combine topics and/or levels of a subject (Advanced Accounting and lower level foreign languages).\nThe 10 course categories enrolling the highest percentage of 1992 12 th graders in their first calendar year of postsecondary education are English Composition (67.1 percent), General Psychology (39.7 percent), College Algebra (19.6 percent), Introduction to Sociology (18.4 percent), U.S. History Surveys (17.5 percent), General Biology (17.2 percent), Physical Education Activities (16.1 percent), General Chemistry (15.2 percent), Freshman Orientations (14.9 percent), and Remedial English/Writing (14.2 percent) (table 3.3). These reflect student choices within the core distribution requirements at many institutions of higher education. \u2022 Higher percentages of 1992 12 th graders who started in community colleges enrolled in pre-collegiate mathematics courses during their first calendar year of attendance than was the case for all postsecondary students in the cohort. This contrast, along with comparative enrollment rates in Remedial English/Writing and Remedial Reading, confirms the dominant role of community colleges in remediation for entering postsecondary students (table 3.3).\nWhen 108 aggregates of the 1,178 course categories in the 2003 taxonomy are constructed, and the participation rates of 1982 and 1992 12 th graders who subsequently earned more than 10 postsecondary credits are compared, one finds (1) significant increases in participation rates in ethnic and culture studies, generalized introductions to science, women's studies, Spanish language, crime studies and services, ethics, environment and natural resources, and computer applications; and (2) major decreases in participation in all business fields, computer programming, and remedial English/writing (table 3.4).\nWhen 108 aggregates of the 1,178 course categories in the 2003 taxonomy are constructed and postsecondary course-taking for 12 th graders of the high school class of 1992 is compared across four major race/ethnicity groupings, there are no statistically significant differences in participation rates in such widely disparate aggregates as nutrition, office occupations, graphics and design, and art history, for example (table 3.6).\nIn considering the empirical core curriculum of 1992 12th graders who became school teachers, both Theology and Bible Study are on the list of the top 30 courses, indicating that teachers in religious education are included. Likewise, Music Performance and Basic Musicianship courses are included, indicating that music teachers working in multiple settings are included (table 4.2).\nIn considering the undergraduate curriculum of school teachers in terms of the number of credits earned in different course clusters: 16 percent earned 11 or more credits in foreign languages; 41 percent earned 11 or more credits in science, and 42 percent did not earn any credits in computer-related courses (table 4.3).\nThe post-baccalaureate course work of 1992 12 th graders who became school teachers and earned credits after the bachelor's degree consists exclusively of education courses, for example, Education Psychology, Curriculum/Curriculum Theory, and Reading Education (table 4.4). Tables  Page  Part 2: The Empirical Core Curriculum\nFive of the top 30 for highly selective institutions carry an international theme: three language course categories, international relations, and non-Western religions. In addition, one observes that no business courses appear among the top 30 for highly selective institutions versus four for selective institutions and five for non-selective institutions-an indication of where business, accounting, and related course work is likely to take place. Conversely, there are no engineering courses on the list of the top 30 for non-selective institutions, versus four on the list for highly selective institutions, and two on that for selective institutions. In general, engineering programs are not offered in non-selective institutions. Among the bachelor's degree granting institutions attended by the Class of 1992 as undergraduates, 43 were highly selective, 113 were selective, and 1240 were non-selective. 9    10 Some of these categories differ from their presentations in Part 2. For example, Western Civilization and World Civilization were combined in Part 2, but in Part 3 they are presented separately. Differential Equations and Brief Calculus/Survey of Calculus, which were combined with the standard Calculus category in Part 2, are split out in Part 3. -37-PART 3:\nIn very few course categories can unambiguous change in enrollment proportions be observed. These categories, with their taxonomy codes, by direction of change, are: Rising percentage enrollments (using significance codes 4 and 7): -43-If one looks across these short lists of examples of change, and then uses a more generous threshold (more generous than 5 percent participation in any one cohort) for inclusion in the background data tapestry, what hypotheses and research questions might be explored? Some suggestions: \u2022 The rise in participation in Spanish-and, though not meeting the 5 percent threshold criteria, Asian languages as well-is paralleled by a decline in the proportion of undergraduates studying major Western European languages such as French and German, and may be affected, in part, by (a) the \"heritage\" language backgrounds of students, and/or (b) the rise of Spanish, Chinese, and Japanese among the languages of international commerce. \u2022 The shift in the emphases of the undergraduate curriculum in psychology toward a more quantitative, experimental base, and away from social psychology parallels research trends in the intersection of psychology and the biological sciences that have increased in intensity since the 1970s. \u2022 The presentation of the undergraduate business curriculum has become more analytical and less practical, partly as a consequence of the role information technology has assumed in the core components of commerce-management, accounting, finance, and marketing-since the massification of computer and software access in the 1990s. 15 The point of these suggested areas for inquiry is that changes in the delivered curriculum may not be isolated phenomena, and that the data presented here must be augmented by information that lies outside the surveys and records of national longitudinal studies focused on educational issues.             \nmajor decreases in participation in all business fields, computer programming, and remedial English, among others. The largest percentage declines within these groups are: computer programming (45 percent), finance (37 percent), remedial English (37 percent), accounting (33 percent), and marketing (30 percent). Some brief comments on these changes are in order. The decline in participation in remedial English reflects the fact that the universe for analysis consists of students who earned more than 10 credits. Among those from the Class of 1992 who did not earn more than 10 credits (hence, are not included in the table), for example, 45 percent took at least one remedial English or remedial reading course, compared with 27 percent for those who did earn more than 10 credits. The 27 percent figure, in turn, is higher than the 18 percent indicated in table 3.4 because table 3.4 includes only those cases where credit of some kind was awarded, and remedial courses often carry no credits at all. Local institutional practice determines what kind (if any) of credits are granted for these courses, and these practices may have changed between the period covered by the history of the Class of 1982Class of (1982Class of -1990 and that covered by the Class of 1992Class of (1992Class of -2000. Analysts are invited to investigate this issue further. The second comment involves what may be a trade-off between the decline in participation in computer programming and the increase in participation in computer applications. Again, while this issue lies outside the scope of this document, those who conduct research in the history of technology, in particular, are invited to explore questions about the relationship between the exponential growth in computing power in the 1982-2000 period to the labor markets in both programming and applications, hence to formal study in these areas in higher education. (2) In applying the standard tests of statistical significance (see appendix B) to differences in participation rates between men and women of the NELS:88/2000, for example, one is guided by what Alsalam and Rodgers (1991) termed a \"female field concentration ratio,\" 23 so that meaningful differences can be highlighted. A ratio of 1.00 indicates a perfect balance between men and women. The higher the ratio, the more women are concentrated in the field, and viceversa. A field may be said to exhibit gender segmentation when the ratio falls below 0.50 (indicating male dominance) or rises above 1.50 (indicating female dominance). 24 If the base is small, for example, in agricultural business (men=3.0 percent; women=0.9 percent; female field concentration ratio=0.30), the difference in participation rates by gender is not meaningful, even though statistically significant. If one confines the principle and benchmarks to course participation rates where differences are 5 percent or more, and imposes the female field concentration ratio formula on the aggregate course-taking data (as set forth in table 3.5), one can reasonably assert meaningfulness where the differences are statistically significant, and find \u2022 some clear cases of gender segmentation emerge in engineering and engineering technologies (the female field concentration ratios for all five aggregates range from 0.13 to 0.24), computer programming (a ratio of 0.42), education (the ratios for the three aggregates are 1.88, 2.02 and 3.58), psychology other than General Psych (1.71), family/child studies and services (2.66), office occupations (1.87), biology service courses (2.27), mechanics/repair (0.05), and nutrition (2.07). \u2022 within the business curriculum, the difference in participation rates are statistically significant in all sub-fields, but although a higher percentage of men than women participated in the aggregate categories, and although the percentage of both men and women who earned credits in those categories is substantial, none of the ratios dips below the 0.50 marker for gender segmentation. \u2022 there are no differences between men's and women's participation rates in such widely disparate aggregates as environment and natural resources, crime studies, public administration, retail and specialty marketing, math statistics, ethics, Bible study, history (all aggregates), political science (all aggregates), graphics and design, art history, fine arts, and communications: other. (3) For determining the meaningfulness of statistically significant differences in curriculum participation by race/ethnicity (table 3.6), there is no recognized benchmark such as the female field concentration ratio used in gender analyses. What one might look for, instead, are cases in which at least 10 percent of one race/ethnicity group earned credits in the aggregate category, and then determine whether there are meaningful statistically significant differences worth noting. In applying standard tests of statistical significance to participation rates by race/ethnicity in the NELS:88/2000 cohort, for example: \u2022 there are no statistically significant differences in participation rates in such widely disparate aggregates as nutrition, family/child studies and services, office occupations, graphics and design, and art history. \u2022 cases in which the only significant differences in participation rates are between White and African-American students and the 10 percent threshold criterion was satisfied are journalism, data and computer applications, oral communication, and U.S. history/American civilization. \u2022 the only case in which the only significant differences in participation rates are between Whites and all minority groups and the 10 percent threshold criterion was satisfied is Education subjects other than Special Education and Teacher Education specialties.   1 Aggregate category was modified in the NELS:88/2000 so that it is not comparable to previous versions in the HS&B/So. 2 Differences between NELS:88/2000 and HS&B/So may be due to minor changes within the aggregate category. 3 Credits earned in these categories usually do not count toward degree awards.

Like its companion, Principal Indicators of Student Academic Histories in Postsecondary Education, 1972-2000 (Adelman 2004), it is designed for use by: \u2022 higher education administrators, faculty, and institutional research officers; \u2022 state higher education offices; \u2022 national organizations concerned with education and training after high school; \u2022 learned societies in the academic disciplines; and \u2022 human resource development personnel concerned with the quality of the workforce. The two documents, and the Web-posted taxonomy of postsecondary courses that accompanies them, are successors to A College Course Map (U.S. Department of Education 1990) and The New College Course Map andTranscript Files (U.S. Department of Education 1995, 2nd edition 1999). Both documents are known as the ?CCM\" and both contain earlier versions of the course taxonomy used in this document. 1 The data are derived from the postsecondary transcript files of three overlapping grade-cohort longitudinal studies conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics. Because they are derived from student records, and not college catalogs, the data reflect the delivered curriculum not the possible curriculum, hence are deemed \"empirical.\" The three NCES studies are called \"grade cohort\" studies because each of them began with a nationally representative sample of students in a specific school grade, and followed the same students through high school and into young adulthood. The three studies are: \u2022 National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972 (NLS-72), which began with a sample of 22,500 12 th graders, and followed sub-panels of this group for 14 years until 1986, when they were 32 or 33 years old. Hereafter, this cohort will be referenced as the \"Class of 1972.\" \u2022 High School & Beyond/Sophomore cohort (HS&B/So), which began with a sample of over 30,000 10 th graders in 1980, and followed sub-panels of this group in surveys for 12 years until 1992, when they were 28 or 29 years old. Hereafter, this cohort will be referenced as the \"Class of 1982,\" the year they were scheduled to graduate from high school. 3 Some of the students initially classified as not in the 12 th grade received regular diplomas in the spring of 1992. The correction of the initial classification was aided by notations of high school graduation status on college transcripts. GEDs (General Education Diplomas) awarded in 1992 were excluded. -2-\u2022 National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88), which began with a sample of 25,000 8 th graders in 1988, and followed sub-panels of this group for 12 years until 2000, when they were 26 or 27 years old. Hereafter, this cohort will be referenced as the \"Class of 1992,\" the year they were scheduled to graduate from high school. The characteristics of each of these longitudinal studies are described in appendix A. Most important to this document is the fact that all three studies included the collection, coding, and analysis of the postsecondary transcripts of students who reported that they had attended colleges, community colleges, and postsecondary trade schools, as follows: \u2022 for the Class of 1972, the transcripts were collected in 1984, when the students were 30 or 31 years old. \u2022 for the Class of 1982, the transcripts were collected in 1993, when the students were 29 or 30 years old. \u2022 for the Class of 1992, the transcripts were collected in 2000, when the students were 26 or 27 years old. For purposes of both consistency and representation of comparable populations, the tables and analyses in both Principal Indicators and The Empirical Curriculum are confined to students who reached the 12 th grade in the year the cohort was scheduled to be in the 12th grade. This boundary was determined by the oldest of these cohorts, the NLS-72, where a nationally representative sample of students was selected in the 12 th grade. Most of them graduated from high school on time in the spring of 1972, but some did not. For the High School & Beyond/Sophomore cohort, which was first sampled in the 10 th grade, the 12 th grade (1982) panel, limited to those who were in school in 1982 and those who received high school diplomas in 1982, 2 was selected to match the NLS-72. Again, most of these students graduated on time in 1982, but some graduated at a later date-or not at all. For the NELS:88/2000, the same procedure was followed, with the universe set to everyone who was in the 12 th grade in1992 along with those who received regular high school diplomas in the spring of 1992. 3 So in all three cases, the national population represented consists of those who were scheduled to be 12th graders in the year they were surveyed (see appendix B for a technical account of the weights and flags used to ensure that the data reflect these populations). Principal Indicators covers topics of access, participation, degree attainment, attendance patterns, majors, grades, and remediation. The Empirical Curriculum turns its attention to the content of education after high school as experienced by young adults through their late 20s. In many respects, the Taxonomy of Postsecondary Courses Based on the National Transcript Samples, 2003 (at www.ed.gov/rschstat/research/pubs/empcurr/index.html) is the critical companion to The Empirical Curriculum. It includes the titles most commonly used in each of over 1,000 course categories, and the ?decision rules\" used in coding courses to the taxonomy when over 2,500 institutions are represented. It also indicates the course categories in which enrollments declined so much over the past 20 years that the categories themselves are no longer viable (though some could revive), which categories have been revived, and which are new in the experience of the NELS:88/2000 students. This Taxonomy and its decision rules may be of particular value to state systems and institutions tracking enrollment mix and conducting institutional and system planning and program review. For example, a project seeking to sharpen distinctions among mathematics courses for purposes of articulation between community colleges and 4-year institutions might reexamine titles and decision rules in light of the taxonomy to render the articulation process more efficient for transfer students. The general reader can use the introduction to the taxonomy to obtain a sense of what is at issue. Officers of learned societies may want to read the entries in order to study the distance between the categories of research articles in their journals and the delivered curriculum as it has emerged in the evidence of student course-taking. Institutional research officers may wish to adapt the taxonomy to tasks of analyzing paths of student movement through local curriculum sequences, mapping the core and identifying the major options students take that lie outside of the sequence. This task can prove useful in enrollment management tasks such as the planning of sections and the timing of course offerings. For example, using the taxonomy categories, the institutional research officer might find that the core of a heavily populated sequence includes introduction to computing, publications (under communication), semiotics, design media, and digital imaging, with a quarter of the students whose records indicate this cluster also taking courses in optics, photography, or object-oriented computer programming. The information, along with enrollment volume, can be considered in the timing of extra sections of design media, offerings of optics, and planning of computer lab space and use."}, {"section_title": "Limitations of This Presentation", "text": "For all readers, however, it is important to note the limitations of what course titles, and even catalog descriptions of what presumably lies behind the titles, represent: they are general parameters of subject matter, nothing more. Even after deciphering titles designed for subject marketing such as \"Zoosemiotics\" or \"Dots to Dinosaurs,\" they do not indicate precisely what was taught or what students learned. Some fields allow for greater variation than others; some courses are more generalized than others. The content of some courses is determined by specialized accrediting bodies, hence is fairly standardized across institutions. The content of sections of other courses can differ widely within the same institution. No national accounting can represent the infinite variations in postsecondary curricula. The best that can be done is to provide conceptual boundaries. \"Zoosemiotics\" at institution X is a course in animal behavior with an emphasis on animal communication, and \"Field Ethology\" at institution Y is also a course on animal behavior with an emphasis on observed nesting. However different their emphases, both courses are within the general parameters of the study of animal behavior. The taxonomy has a category and code for Animal Behavior, and the tables in The Empirical Curriculum indicate the proportion of undergraduates in three cohorts who have successfully completed a course within the boundaries of that category."}, {"section_title": "Terminology of Presentation", "text": "This document uses five terms to describe the content of the delivered curriculum-from micro to macro dimensions-in postsecondary contexts."}, {"section_title": "Course category", "text": "The course category, or course, is the smallest unit of analysis. It is a label describing a discrete subject-matter such as agricultural mechanics, word processing, international communications, Shakespeare, or organic chemistry. These labels are those found in college catalogs for specific course offerings. There are 1,178 categories in the Taxonomy, of which 45 do not describe \"courses\" as listed in catalogs, but rather serve as codes to mark various forms of credit-byexamination or study abroad, for example. Many of the course categories cover a range of related subjects or different presentations of the same subject. For example, all electrical engineering courses, including circuit design, analog signals, and sequential circuits are covered in the same category. The category for U.S. history topics through the Civil War may cover courses in the \"Age of Jackson,\" \"Revolution and Constitution,\" and the \"Salem Witch Trials.\" Each of the 1178 categories has a distinct 6-digit code, the first two digits indicating the broad \"field\" of curriculum under which the category is placed. The code for electrical engineering, for example, is 141001. The codes for all engineering course categories begin with \"14.\" With the exception of tables 3.4, 4.1, and 4.3, all of the tables in The Empirical Curriculum use the course category as the core unit of analysis, and the course category titles are always capitalized as they would be in college catalogs."}, {"section_title": "Field", "text": "The 1,178 categories in the Taxonomy and their codes are organized in 50 broad fields, plus a section for categories and journal entries such as \"Study Abroad: Field Unspecified\" that could not be placed elsewhere. The 50 fields were initially derived from the 1981 edition of The Classification of Instructional Programs, and the codes follow the numbering order of that taxonomy, in which the fields were arranged alphabetically, from Agriculture (01) to Visual and Performing Arts (50). In the major presentation of the percentage of students who earned undergraduate credits in 645 of the 1,178 course categories (table 3.1), the course categories are arranged by field. Appendix C lists the 50 fields and the ranges of their codes."}, {"section_title": "Course aggregate", "text": "The 1,178 categories are often an unwieldy analytic tool, hence mutually exclusive aggregates of these categories were created. Sometimes, the aggregate puts together course categories that form a coherent substrate of a field, for example, mass communications, radio, and television (as distinct from other sub-fields of communications, such as journalism and interpersonal communication). Sometimes, the aggregate cuts across fields, for example, classical studies and languages draws together course categories from literature, foreign languages, history, and art. For the NELS:88/2000, there are 112 aggregates of which 3 were not used because they refer to examinations, unclassifiable courses, and journal entries. Most of the aggregates were consistently defined from one cohort to the next, but the changing nature of the delivered curriculum forced some additions and changes that are described in the introductory remarks for table 3.4. Appendix D provides details on the course categories included under each of the aggregates."}, {"section_title": "Course credit clusters", "text": "The course credit cluster is used only once in this document, in table 4.3. In many ways, a course credit cluster is like an aggregate. Sometimes, in fact, the course category content of a cluster is identical to that of an aggregate, for example, \"college level mathematics\" and \"calculus and advanced mathematics.\" But it is created for a different analytic purpose: to add up credits earned across course categories where the relationship among the categories is an analytic concept. For example, \"upper division laboratory science,\" as a cluster, is informed by a very different notion than those governing the aggregates in science, and includes all core laboratory science courses (in astronomy, biology, chemistry, geology, and physics) for which the introductory-level course in the field is a prerequisite. And while the course aggregates are mutually exclusive, course credit clusters are not necessarily so. For the NELS:88/2000, some 54 clusters were created, and the course category for environmental science, for example, appears in two of them. Appendix E indicates what categories are included under each of the clusters."}, {"section_title": "Undergraduate career", "text": "\"Undergraduate career\" is a special abbreviation marking a period of 8.5 years after the modal high school graduation date for each of the three cohorts whose course-taking is described in these pages. The period of 8.5 years was determined by the shortest of the cohort studies, the NELS:88/2000, for which the modal high school graduation date was June 1992, and the last date of postsecondary transcript entries was December 2000. The NLS-72 (Class of 1972) boundary for undergraduate career was set at December 1980 and the High School & Beyond/Sophomore cohort (Class of 1982) boundary was set at December 1990. While some students earn graduate and first professional degrees within that 8.5 year time span, the heuristic refers only to undergraduate activity that took place during that period."}, {"section_title": "Technical Notes and Guidance:", "text": "All three cohorts involve national samples of a given high school population, for example, 12 th graders in 1992. If there were 3 million 12 th graders in 1992 and the sample consisted of 15,000 students, each student in the sample represents hundreds-and sometimes thousands-of other students. Precisely how many others a student will represent depends on the weight he/she is assigned, a weight determined in inverse proportion to the odds that the student would be selected by chance. Once the initial weight is determined, it is modified in subsequent panels in which the student participates. For the 1992 12 th grade example, the raw N is 15,000 and the weighted N is 3 million. For the same students who subsequently entered postsecondary education and for whom at least one transcript was received, the raw N is 8,900 and the weighted N is 2.1 million. All estimates in this volume are based on weighted Ns, and the weighted N is indicated in the notes to each of the tables. The estimates of course-taking may be affected by the distribution of postsecondary institutions attended by students in a given grade cohort longitudinal study. There are difficulties in assessing the degree to which the distribution of enrollments by students in a longitudinal study differs from national enrollment data, by institutional type, since the longitudinal study students often attend more than one type of institution. For example, the national distribution of undergraduate enrollments for the fall of 1998 show 54.0 percent in 4-year institutions, 42.8 percent in 2-year institutions, and 3.2 percent in less-than-2-year institutions (Snyder 2000, tables 171 and 178). The weighted distribution for the NELS:88/2000 cohort in its entire undergraduate history, 1992-2000, has 49.7 percent attending a 4-year college at any time, 46.0 percent attending a 2-year college at any time, and 4.3 percent attending a less-than-2-year college at any time. These data imply an underweighting of 4-year colleges. However, if one asked for the distribution of received undergraduate transcripts by these basic institutional types (thus accounting for attendance at more than one institution of the same type), one would mark 52.3 percent from 4-year colleges, 44.7 percent from 2-year colleges, and 3 percent from lessthan-2-year schools. This unweighted distribution (unweighted because the unit of analysis is the transcript, not the student) is much closer to the reported national enrollment distribution. Regardless of which measurement is selected, the reader should be aware of potential bias of the sample of schools attended when interpreting, for example, the proportion of students who earned any credits in a discrete course category (table 3.1) or in an aggregate course category (table 3.4)."}, {"section_title": "Organization of This Document", "text": "The Empirical Curriculum is divided in four parts. Part 1, Making the Map, is somewhat technical and describes how the databases on which the taxonomy of courses and analyses of course-taking, credits, grades, degrees, and so forth were constructed and edited. The section emphasizes methodology and procedure. Part 2 focuses on student time, for which credits are proxy measures. The tables in this section of the document isolate the courses that account for the largest percentage of student time, and do so for different student populations. Table 2.1 takes all postsecondary credits earned by 12 th  graders of 1972, 1982, and 1992 who subsequently were awarded bachelor's degrees and asks which courses accounted for a plurality of those credits. The answer yields the empirical core curriculum. Other tables ask which of these courses were held in common by race/ethnicity in all three cohorts; how the empirical core curriculum for bachelor's degree recipients of men differed from that for women in the high school classes of 1982 and 1992; what was the empirical core curriculum of students who earned more than 10 credits but no credential of any kind in the same two cohorts; and how the empirical core curriculum of bachelor's degree recipients from the high school class of 1992 differed by selectivity of the institution awarding the bachelor's degree. In all these cases, the course category is the unit of analysis. Part 3, where the student is the unit of analysis, asks two questions: \u2022 What proportion of students studied X as undergraduates? and \u2022 How has this proportion changed over the past three decades? There are six tables in this section. The first table (table 3.1) splits the universe into two groups: everyone who earned more than 10 credits in postsecondary education, and everyone who earned bachelor's degrees (this second group is obviously included in the first as well), and answers the two basic questions for 645 course categories dominated by undergraduate enrollments. The second table in this section (table 3.2) presents a rank ordering of the top 100 courses by percentage enrollment share, for the 12 th graders in the high school Class of 1992 who earned more than 10 postsecondary credits, indicating the weighted number of these students who enrolled at least once in each course, and average number of credits earned in that category. The third table (table 3.3) isolates course-taking in the first calendar year of enrollment for the Class of 1992, and presents the 35 course categories with the highest percentage of enrollments, and, for each category, the average number of credits earned and the proportion of all credits earned by students in the first calendar year. It also highlights the first year course-taking of students who began their postsecondary careers in community colleges. The fourth, fifth, and sixth tables take 1,000 course categories and combine them in108 course aggregates. The tables answer the same question as table 3.1, first by comparing the records of the Class of 1982 to those of the Class of 1992, then by gender and race/ethnicity for the Class of 1992. These tables enable users at individual institutions or in states to compare what their traditionalage students are studying to changes in the national tapestry. The tables also provide commentators accurate data on topics such as trends in foreign language study among those who enter higher education by their mid-20s. Part 4 takes up the special topic of the curriculum pursued by those of the Class of 1992 who became school teachers by age 26 or 27. It sets forth their core curriculum, the distribution of credits they earned in broad curricular clusters, and offers a snapshot of their post-baccalaureate course work. The Conclusion suggests where the broad outlines of the map delineated in this volume are most likely to be rendered three-dimensional by deeper probing, and the variations in presentation that are possible with extant databases. PART 1:"}, {"section_title": "Making the Map-History and Process", "text": "What, specifically, do we study after high school? What knowledge is the nation acquiring in colleges, community colleges, trade schools, and other postsecondary institutions? Answers to these basic questions are important in assessing the quality of our workforce and cultural life. Answers to these questions are important in advising individuals on how to prepare for the challenges of adulthood, for helping state higher education agencies monitor educational services to different populations, and for guiding the Nation in preparing for economic, political, and social challenges of the new century. The most accessible answers to these questions are both too general to be very useful and too narrow in their sources. That is, the computers whirring with national data can answer the questions only with reference to degrees and credentials actually awarded and only in terms of the dominant field, or \"major,\" of those credentials. The annual Digest of Education Statistics (see, e.g., Snyder 2001) provides easily accessible information on how many associate's degrees were awarded in nursing or how many bachelor's degrees in accounting or how many doctoral degrees in history. Such information is helpful but limited. It does not indicate, for example, how much science the nurses studied or what kind of science it was, hence how well nursing graduates may be prepared to adapt to changes in biomedicine. To answer these questions requires detailed empirical data on the courses in which students enrolled and completed after high school. Those data are available only from transcripts generated as students pass through colleges, community colleges, and trade schools. Fortunately, there are three national samples of postsecondary transcripts in existence that provide such detailed data. But the variety of course titles, departments of instruction, and allied data (credits, terms, grades) on those transcripts is infinite. Without a system to describe those courses economically and with consistency, it is very difficult to negotiate the terrain and answer the questions. With such considerations in mind, the former Office of Educational Research and Improvement (now the Institute of Education Sciences) of the U.S. Department of Education set out to develop a postsecondary course \"map,\" so that changes in student course-taking could be tracked over time. The project began in 1988."}, {"section_title": "Origins and History of This Project", "text": "The initial purpose of this project was to arrive at a credible and empirically viable taxonomy of course categories with which to analyze the college transcripts of over 12,000 students in the Postsecondary Education Transcript Sample (PETS) of the National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972 (NLS-72). The NLS-72 was the first of the grade-cohort longitudinal studies carried out by the National Center for Education Statistics. The transcripts for this group were gathered in 1984, 12 years after high school graduation. The students were 30 or 31 years old at the time. The task of developing the taxonomy and presenting what became the baseline data on course-taking was carried out between 1988-90, and the results were published as A College Course Map (Adelman 1990). The NLS-72 postsecondary transcripts were collected in the summer and fall of 1984, and subsequently coded by temporary office workers using the 1981 version of The Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP). The CIP system, created by the National Center for Education Statistics, has served as the de facto national standard for reporting enrollments and credentials in postsecondary programs since 1981. The CIP system was revised in 1985, and again in 1990 and 2000 (Hunt, Morgan, and Carpenter 1991;Morgan and Hunt 2002). Programs are not courses, and the CIP taxonomy was not designed with transcript analysis in mind. Nonetheless, it had been used to code postsecondary transcripts of the NLS-72. When the electronic file was delivered and carefully examined, it was determined that approximately 40 percent of the 485,000 instances of course-taking recorded in the NLS-72 transcript sample had not been coded accurately, and that the \"miscoding\" was as much a function of the CIP system as it was the result of limited technology in the coding process. Both the Commission on Workforce Quality of the U.S. Department of Labor and the National Science Foundation recognized the potential of this database once it was cleaned. In 1989 and 1990, both agencies thus provided financial support for this project."}, {"section_title": "Basic Order: The First Construction of the Taxonomy of Courses, the High School Class of 1972", "text": "In 1989-90, the recoding of the NLS-72 database, including a reconstruction of the CIP system according to pre-established criteria and rules, was undertaken. The basic order and structure of the CIP was retained as follows: \u2022 six-digit codes for each course/program, the first two of which indicated a broad field; \u2022 50 broad fields, arranged in alphabetical order from Agribusiness to Visual and Performing Arts (see appendix C); \u2022 the use of \"99\" as the last two digits of a six-digit code to designate either indeterminable, missing, or other entries; and \u2022 the use of \"01\" as the last two digits of a six-digit code to designate general treatments of the subject matter. There were some obvious semantic adjustments for purposes of coding courses (as opposed to programs). But this basic order and structure was kept because it did the least harm to a system that was already familiar to college registrars, institutional research officers, state departments of higher education, and other users. Initially, recoding efforts were focused on the nearly 25 percent of all instances of course-taking that had been assigned to the various \"99\" (\"other\") categories; and the various \"01\" (\"general\") codes in those disciplines for which there was more than one code. The objective was to render the unknown, known; and the general, specific. In examining the original coding of the transcripts, an ancient truism was reinforced: the word \"other\" easily becomes a bin into which difficult problems and indeterminate realities are dumped. After these tasks had been completed, the process branched out to the other categories. In all, entries under 850 of the original 1,099 CIP codes were reviewed, and entries under 720 of those were reclassified. In the process, 400 course categories were deleted (principally because they contained very few cases of course-taking) and 338 new categories were created. This work was reviewed by panels of faculty, and revised in accordance with their recommendations."}, {"section_title": "Deletions and Additions: The Empirical Criteria", "text": "An a priori rule was set that no course category would be maintained in the taxonomy unless there was sufficient empirical evidence for doing so. Six-digit CIP code categories were thus deleted if (a) they were redundant or unnecessary in light of other categories and/or if course titles could be placed more accurately in another category, or (b) they produced fewer than 0.00005 percent of the 440,000 valid instances (excluding transfer courses, unclassifiable titles, credit-by-examination) of course-taking in the NLS-72 postsecondary transcript sample-that is, 22 cases. With the 0.00005 percent formula, the threshold dropped to 16 for the High School & Beyond/Sophomore cohort and rose to18 for the NELS:88/2000. There are two exceptions to the threshold rule: (a) courses in which the subject matter has a direct relationship to national security interests-for example, less commonly taught foreign languages; and (b) categories that, if eliminated, would leave no logical place in the system for the subject matter-for example, Public Works (Utilities, Sanitation) Administration, Stationary Energy Sources/Power Plant Operations, and Jewelry Design and Fabrication. As for new codes in this first (NLS-72) version of the taxonomy, the vast majority resulted from disaggregations of categories of major disciplines in which the existing CIP system offered either one code (including anthropology, economics, geography, history, political science, and sociology), or a small number of codes that did not reflect the full curricular range in the subject (e.g., computer science, mathematics, biological sciences, English, and music)."}, {"section_title": "Traces of Consensus and the Taxonomy of Courses", "text": "While the taxonomy is empirically driven, a framework for creating order from apparent chaos was necessary. The initial organizing principles for new categories created in the processes of disaggregation or reconfiguration were thus drawn from one or more of the following: (a) where they existed, content specifications for Graduate Record subject examinations (see Oltman 1982;Devore and McPeek 1985). (b) indices of sub-fields in the major journals of the disciplines. (c) categories used in surveys by such organizations as the Conference Board of the Mathematical Sciences (Albers, Loftsgaarden, Rung, and Watkins 1992), and the Modern Language Association's annual Survey of Language Course Enrollments. (e) the empirical character of the database itself, for example, if there were 200 \"Animal Behavior\" titles that had been entered and classified as \"Zoology: Other,\" they were reassigned to a new and unique code. (f) the advice of representatives of disciplinary associations who attended a series of open meetings conducted in 1989 by the National Center for Education Statistics to discuss revision of the CIP system for purposes of reporting degrees and program enrollments. (g) the advice of 50 consultants and members of external faculty review teams. The first postulate informing this effort was that any field leaves unobtrusive traces of consensus concerning its content, and that those traces are public evidence, carrying higher authority than the testimony of individuals. De facto national examinations constructed with the advice and consent of representatives of scholarly or professional organizations constitute one such collection of evidence; indices of the literature included in the major journals of those fields constitute another. To be sure, the indices reflect research and applications emphases, and thus are often too detailed to serve as a taxonomy of postsecondary instruction. However, the indices are very much like an official topographical map, providing three-dimensional information on existing and emerging sub-fields."}, {"section_title": "Which Should We Use-Subject Matter or Department of Instruction?", "text": "A taxonomy designed to produce a national tapestry was governed by a decision rule that subject matter takes precedence over department of instruction. A course in \"The Neurological Bases of Behavior,\" for example, could be offered by a Biology Department, a Psychology Department, or some other unit. For purposes of the taxonomy, however, there is a single slot for neuroscience courses. A physiological psychology course will include major units on the neurological bases of behavior, but physiological psychology is a broader subject than neuroscience, and has a different slot in the taxonomy. The exceptions to this principle were grounded in academic custom and usage, for example, \"Criminal Procedure\" taught in a law school is not the same course as \"Criminal Procedure\" taught in a police academy. \"Avian Diseases\" in a school of veterinary medicine is not the same course as \"Poultry Diseases\" in a school of agriculture. \"Child Development\" in a psychology department is not the same course as \"Child Study\" in a school of Family & Community Services. Furthermore, the department of instruction is too often determined by the size, organizational complexity, mission, and faculty politics of an institution (Slaughter 2002). In smaller institutions, fields such as sociology, anthropology, demography, and urban studies are often combined in the same department. Large research universities have separate departments for all of these fields. Some community colleges have one department for all of \"science.\" While there have been other multi-institutional college transcript samples (for the most noted recent cases, see Shaman 1994;Ratcliff et al 1995), they were designed to yield models for evaluating curricular effectiveness or coherence in individual institutions. Their analytical frameworks lean heavily on the constructs of \"clustering\" and sequence in course-taking behavior, constructs that depend heavily on local rules, scheduling, departmental prerogatives, and circumstance. These efforts can be very helpful in local assessments, and can aid the search for the curricular paths that make the greatest positive impact on different kinds of college student learning-and that is their purpose; but they have limited value in national accounting. From a national perspective, there are two other and related reasons for the primacy of subject matter, reasons that do not emerge in typical applications of transcript information in individual colleges or other postsecondary institutions: \u2022 Providing information to policy-makers on the knowledge-content of work/manpower preparation. That is, an industry association or state agency might wish to estimate particular kinds of knowledge or skills that are being brought into the workforce by former students, whether they earned degrees or not. For example, the state agency might like to know how many people have studied juvenile delinquency as one aspect of the education of those who come to human service or criminal justice careers. If the courses are coded in different sections of the map (e.g., Social Work, Family and Community Studies, and Administration of Justice), an estimate of who is prepared to address these juvenile issues in the workplace would be compromised. In the system of coding used for the postsecondary transcript files, there is only one place for all courses with the titles \"Juvenile Delinquency.\" \u2022 Providing information to learned and professional societies on trends in topics studied in their fields. Learned and professional societies such as the American Historical Association or the American Chemical Society are national (indeed, international) information systems. Through their conventions and publications they both monitor the extent to which new developments in their fields are being presented to future practitioners and influence the dissemination of knowledge in educational institutions. They thus play a critical role in maintaining the quality of postsecondary education. Specific subject matter, not department of instruction, dominates the education-related publications and reports of these organizations. The NELS:88/2000 transcripts, covering the period 1992-2000, forced a modification of the \"primacy of subject\" guidance, principally because catalog course descriptions were heavily employed in the process of coding. There were many cases where program or departmental descriptions of courses with the same titles differed in significant ways.  Foods and Dietetics (190504). Only the third case is carried forward from the two previous iterations of the taxonomy. The other two are new codes resulting from the examination of institutional catalogs."}, {"section_title": "The Process of Coding and Recoding", "text": "There was one data editor for the entire process, and for all three (1990, 1995/1999, and 2003) versions. This strategy increases reliability (while introducing intra-coder bias) at the cost of timeliness. Intra-coder bias raises the issue of drift in assignment of titles to categories, but in critical and difficult cases, a second judge was utilized. For the 1990 version of the College Course Map (CCM), the process worked roughly as follows. For each field in which substantial reconstruction was deemed necessary, a preliminary taxonomy was developed based on one or more of the unobtrusive traces of consensus. From the transcript data were then extracted all those courses (and their allied variables, such as institution, credits, student majors, etc.) that were originally assigned to codes in the field at issue. The courses were then recoded-if necessary-according to the tentative taxonomy, with decision rules developed in the process. In the cases of 17 (out of 33) major groupings of academic or occupational training fields such as communications, biological sciences, and history, the tentative taxonomy, new codings, and decision rules were then presented to an external team of faculty from the fields at issue. This team reviewed this work to make suggestions for changing the taxonomy, to develop new decision rules, and to mark up computer printouts of all transcript entries in the field-with corrections according to the way they saw things. The course files were then recoded. For the 1990 version of the CCM, where questions remained, a sample of college and community college catalogs were consulted, using a microfiche collection from 1977-78. Approximately 20 major titles were subject to this supplementary review, including \"Visual Communications,\" \"Human Growth and Development,\" \"Conflict Resolution,\" \"Communication Law,\" \"Modern English Grammar,\" \"Group Dynamics,\" and \"Personal and Social Adjustment.\" For example, in the case of \"Human Growth and Development,\" course titles for the 1972-84 period had been coded by the contractor under biological sciences, psychology, home economics, anthropology, and education. The catalog review provided decision rules that eliminated anthropology and education as options, created a new course category under biological sciences, and provided guidance for placing the remaining titles. As for \"Modern English Grammar,\" institutional type became a determinant of classification: in most 4-year institutions, it was a linguistics course; in most 2-year institutions, it was a remedial English course. In the case of \"Visual Communications,\" no clear-cut pattern emerged from the catalog search: the title was found in roughly equal proportions under advertising, fine arts, and design. The course was usually described as a general introduction to visual semiotics. It was thus given a new code as a general course in Arts, and with sufficient cases to justify the category. Student-level records were also used. Under the NSF-sponsored portion of the project, for example, an advisory panel examined the records of all students who earned bachelor's degrees in the core science and engineering fields. In the process, one could easily spot miscodings of courses, since every record presents a distinct context and tone. For example, a course entitled \"Composition,\" with no indication of the department of instruction might have been coded as \"English Composition\"or \"drawing\"or \"Music Theory.\" But the student record showed a major in Russian, no courses in fine arts, and the \"Composition\" course occurring in the third year of college. Such clues were sufficient for recoding the course under Russian language for that student. Over 4,000 titles were recoded by this method. This process was not applied to every one of the 1,037 categories used to describe course-taking for the 1972-84 period. In some fields (e.g., where geography courses can be sorted by world area or music history courses by genre), the empirical character of the database drove the categories. In effect, the database disaggregated and sorted itself. For the portion of the project sponsored by the National Science Foundation, the process was somewhat more elaborate in that the work of the faculty review teams was both advised and subsequently reviewed by a five-person advisory board and NSF personnel. The fields covered included agricultural sciences, computer science, engineering, engineering technologies, allied health sciences, clinical health sciences, biological sciences, physical sciences, and science technologies. Work on the mathematics section had been previously reviewed by the Mathematical Sciences Education Board. The process for the first version of the College Course Map took more than 2 years. The results of this editing were presented to the National Center for Education Statistics as a supplementary file for the National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972 (Adelman 1992), and are included on the public release CD-ROM version of that data set (NCES 94-487)."}, {"section_title": "The Nature of Revision: the Postsecondary Transcript Sample for the High School Class of 1982", "text": "In 1990, the College Course Map (CCM) said that \"we do not expect the final taxonomy for the 10-year postsecondary transcript sample of the High School and Beyond/Sophomores (High School Class of 1982) to be precisely the same.\" The period turned out to be 11 years after scheduled high school graduation , hence even more comparable to the NLS-72 than originally imagined. These expectations were borne out. To maintain consistency, the 1990 CCM taxonomy was used to code the High School and Beyond/Sophomore postsecondary transcripts. But the transcripts produced by those who were high school sophomores in 1980 were inevitably different from those produced by students who were high school seniors in the spring of 1972. Not all sophomores graduate from high school, whereas almost all seniors do. Some of the sophomores (8 percent) wound up receiving high school equivalency certificates well after their expected dates of graduation. Other sophomores started taking courses in community colleges and other postsecondary institutions while they were still enrolled in high school. In terms of academic background and momentum, the population of the Class of 1982 was more diverse than that of the Class of 1972. It is thus not surprising that a higher proportion of the transcripts received for the Class of 1982 came from non-collegiate institutions such as trade and career schools, vocational high schools that provide instruction to people who have earned high school diplomas, job training centers, non-degree awarding Area Vocational-Technical Institutes (AVTIs), and hospital-based programs. As the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS) surveys of 1987, 1990, 1993, and 1996 have shown, students attending these institutions consume a disproportionate share of Title IV funds, and tend to be more \"non-traditional\" in terms of ethnicity, age, dependency, and socioeconomic status than those attending 2-year and 4-year colleges (Bryce and Schmitt 1992;Choy and Premo 1995;Fitzgerald et al. 1994;Horn and Berktold 1998). Some of the changes in course-taking volume reflect this more diffuse and less collegiate sample of transcripts received for the high school Class of 1982. For example, more than 50 percent of course-taking cases in cosmetology, beauty salon management, funeral services, heating/ventilating/air conditioning (HVAC), automotive mechanics, auto body repair, and vehicle equipment operation came from the non-collegiate sector. The history of the Class of 1992, however, reflected a contractions of the non-collegiate sector, with the proportion of students starting out in sub-baccalaureate institutions other than community colleges falling to 4.8 percent (s.e.= 0.37) from 7.5 percent (s.e.=0.47) from a decade earlier."}, {"section_title": "Continuity in the Taxonomy", "text": "Even though the Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) was revised in 1990, the coding system for the New College Course Map was still based on the 1981 edition of the CIP. It was based on that edition to maintain consistency with the Class of 1972 coding so that accurate time-series data could be offered, and because some institutions had adopted the taxonomy as a guide to tracking student course-taking behavior. It would have been unfair to change the rules. The CCM taxonomy was given to the teams hired by the Department's contractor to enter data from the original High School and Beyond/Sophomore transcripts. The teams consisted of graduate students, who consulted weekly with the data editor. An automated system took keywords from the course titles, and limited the range of codes available for data entry. At that point, decision rules entered to narrow the range even further. The result was a database with more accuracy in course coding than its predecessor. Still, due to the emergence of new titles for which the existing taxonomy did not account, there were thousands of other cases in which titles were either placed in the \"other\" (99) bins, or scattered according to the principle of best guessing. An uncodable course title might read, \"UC/IDIS.\" A course title coded for the \"other\" bin in computer science, for example, might read \"Computer Science Seminar.\" The title is very generalized and does not fit any of the other categories-but does indicate what field is at issue, and needs a home. The process of review began with extracting all the titles (and accompanying information such as institution, institutional course number, credits, and grades) in the various \"99\" bins to see whether they could be placed in more determinate positions. It continued by looking at codes with fewer than 20 cases to determine whether the code was still viable. These procedures inevitably generate other inquiries. If, for example, there were many cases of women's history courses being classified as \"History: Other,\" the phenomenon suggested that all courses coded under \"Women's Studies\" should be reexamined. This inquiry lead to the creation of four new codes in women's studies, and the gathering of titles from other parts of the database under those codes. The review process also paid particular attention to codes for remedial courses. This focus resulted in a number of refinements in the taxonomy of writing and language skills courses, including a new code (231102) for Advanced Composition (as opposed to Creative Writing), and a code for English and writing proficiency examinations (230403). Likewise, a review of the mathematics codes resulted in the creation of a new code for Advanced Statistics (270502), a number of refinements to the calculus codes, and the creation of a new code to designate those introductory courses in physics that included the words, \"with calculus\" (400830). In an ironic but revealing turn, it was the examination of remedial courses opened up the taxonomy to a fuller and more accurate accounting of advanced mathematics."}, {"section_title": "Major Changes in the Taxonomy: 1990 to 1995/1999", "text": "Comparing the 1990 and 1995 editions of the CCM, we find 80 new or restored course categories, and 81 categories that were viable in the period 1972-84 but not viable for the period 1982-93. The net number of categories in the taxonomy, then, barely changed: 1,038. The major changes occurred in office support courses, communications, computer science, nursing, law, liberal/general studies, women's studies, basic skills, student activities and service (a wholly new chapter of courses), and engineering technology. By \"major\" is meant fundamental reconceptualization of the representation of a field in the taxonomy. Thus, for example, the 1990 CCM had only three codes or categories for law: One could argue, for example, that there are more cases of \"Torts\" than International/ Comparative Law, therefore \"Torts\" deserves its own category. But few, if any students outside law schools in the High School & Beyond/Sophomore cohort took a course in \"torts,\" whereas international and comparative law turned up as much in business and international studies programs as in law schools. The new taxonomy allowed the distinction between the core law school curriculum and the most significant and numerous cases of law-related studies in other contexts. At the time (1995) it was noted, \"This, too, may change with the next generation.\" The 1990s saw a significant increase in para-legal preparation programs, and these were reflected in the postsecondary course-taking of the Class of 1992. A new category, \"Law for Para-legals,\" was thus created for the 2003 accounting of course-taking, to handle titles that parallel those offered in the core law school curriculum (particularly contracts, wills and estates, and family law) but which mark courses delivered in survey form to legal support personnel. There are 50 aggregate \"disciplinary\" field groupings inherited from the Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP). While all 50 fields were reviewed at one time or another in the editorial process, special reviews were conducted in 1995 in nine areas: architecture, communications, communications technologies, computer science, engineering, engineering technologies, allied health sciences/services, clinical health sciences/services, and mathematics. Some of these were chosen because of changes in the disciplines since 1980 (communications and computer science). Others were chosen because of ambiguities in course categories (architecture and communications technologies). Still others were chosen because of comments received from the field concerning the 1990 edition of the CCM. These nine categories accounted for nearly 20 percent of all courses in the database. The 1995 reviews were conducted in the same manner as those in 1990. Teams of faculty came in to review the taxonomy, develop or refine decision rules, and read through computer printouts of student records in the fields at issue to determine whether errors in coding had been made. In addition, a special review panel of registrars and institutional research officers was convened to resolve ambiguities in matters of degrees, degree dates, and majors across the entire range of the transcript files."}, {"section_title": "The 2003 Transcript Files: The Major Changes", "text": "The entire process of data entry and transcript file production for the NELS:88/2000 was conducted in a different way from its predecessors. The NLS-72 and HS&B/Sophomore postsecondary transcript files were first built by contractors who then presented electronic files for editing and recoding. In both cases, the process took 4-5 years from the time transcript documents were received. For the NELS:88/2000, the contractor (Research Triangle Institute) was responsible for the complex process of gathering transcripts and catalogs from institutional registrars (see , and forwarding copies to the data entry site. The task of data entry was then combined with editorial and monitored at a secure site by U.S. Department of Education staff, and the time to produce a beta version of the files cut to 2 years. The American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers in Washington, DC, was the host organization for the data entry phase. With paper records and catalogs in hand (instead of an electronic file), and the host organization representing America's registrars, problems of interpretation could be referred instantly to local officials responsible for the preparation of student records, and ambiguities concerning degree awards, transfer data, and abbreviations for department of instruction and course titles could be resolved quickly. The NELS:88/2000 course coding process inherited its taxonomy from the High School & Beyond/Sophomore files: 1,038 categories. By the time 370,000 courses in the file were coded, 38 of those codes were dropped or suspended (due to low volume), and 157 were added. In addition, a new section of 20 codes covering credit-by-examination (Advanced Placement, CLEP, and departmental exams) was included. The external faculty panels reviewed fields in the taxonomy that evidenced continual problems in the HS&B/Sophomore study, and those that had not previously been covered in depth: agricultural sciences, biological sciences, clinical health sciences, physical sciences, engineering, engineering technologies, computer science, business, specialized marketing, humanities (literature, languages other than English, philosophy, religious studies, art history, and music history), and occupational fields (business support, communications technologies, mechanics & repair, precision production, allied health services, and transportation). Before coding began, faculty reviewers were asked to examine the 1999 taxonomy in their fields (and allied fields) and to respond to three questions: Faculty responses to these questions helped shape the background for review sessions, and an example of the instructions for these review sessions is presented in appendix F. The review procedures were the same as those employed for the NLS-72 and HS&B/Sophomores, with the panels marking up printouts of course entries (including code, local course number, type of institution, number of credits, student major) in their fields. By the time the panels met in the spring of 2001, over 100,000 courses had been coded for their consideration. Following their recommendations, the process of coding the rest of the transcripts took place. This process was stymied by generalized titles and abbreviations that even the faculty review panels did not recognize-hence, the use of catalogs and on-line catalogs. Some 7,000 titles covering approximately 40,000 entries were resolved with catalog searches. Nearly half of these titles were in mathematics (e.g., \"College Math,\" \"Math Concepts,\" \"Business Math\"). One has to read course descriptions to identify the principal topics covered, hence, where in the taxonomy these cases go. \"Intro to College Math,\" for example, can be College Algebra, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Finite Mathematics, and even Calculus. \"Math for Business\" can be arithmeticbased, algebra-based, or calculus-based-the course description in the catalogs provides the directions. Some of the new codes that emerged were the result of disaggregating titles under single, generalized categories such as Linguistics (now 4 separate codes). Others represent new topics for which course-taking occurred in significant volume during the 1990s (for example, courses under history in The Holocaust, Vietnam, and World War II)."}, {"section_title": "Themes in the New Codes", "text": "The following themes that cross disciplinary lines emerge from the list of the codes that are new to the 2003 taxonomy by virtue of postsecondary course-taking volume: \u2022 Internationalism. There are new codes for international agriculture, public health, environmental issues, communication, national security, and international political economy. \u2022 Environment. New codes emerged in chemistry, geology, law, education, and public health. The environmental studies codes increased from two to five. \u2022 Information Systems/Information Technology. The business curriculum added \"Management of Information Systems\"; engineering technologies has new codes for telecommunications technology and information technology; the number of codes for computer programming languages increased from one to five; and there were sufficient cases of course-taking to justify a new category on Information Organization & Transfer under library/information sciences. In addition to curricular themes in the new codes, there are also two delivery themes: \u2022 Cooperative education and internships. New codes can be found in agriculture, family and community studies, allied health, child development, and public affairs (in addition to nine fields where the volume of these course experiences had been previously recognized in the taxonomy, and a generic slot for \"Cooperative Education: Field Unspecified\"). \u2022 Independent study/undergraduate research codes can now be found in business, communications, family and community studies, health/physical ed/recreation (HPER), biology, psychology, and history. In the two previous iterations of the taxonomy, most independent study was marked under a generic code for \"Unspecified Field.\" Concerning delivery modes, it is important to note that the NELS:88/2000 transcript sample documents did not indicate whether a course was taken in a \"distance\" or \"distributed\" format (e.g., synchronous/asynchronous on-line or televised). Remote sites were indicated in a few instances, but the mode of communication to or at those sites was not marked."}, {"section_title": "Major Revisions of the Faculty Review Panels", "text": "While the core of the taxonomy remained untouched, the NELS:88/2000 faculty review panels made a number of recommendations resulting in major revisions. The most notable of these was to remove all computer applications courses from the field for computer science and place them either in the specific fields to which they referred or in a new field section of the taxonomy devoted to computer applications (this field replaced an existing slot in the taxonomy which had been called \"industrial arts,\" and which was no longer viable). Thus, new codes for computer applications can be found in agriculture, music, design, accounting, engineering, engineering technologies, and graphic/printing communications. The business support/secretarial chapter retained codes for keyboarding, word processing, and introduction to operating systems such as Windows, but general office software packages and discrete training in spreadsheets, database, and presentation software were assigned to new codes in the new computer applications field section. Also included in that section are codes for training in statistical programs such as SAS, SPSS, and STATA, general business application software (not programming in COBOL), and applications packages in the social sciences. This change was designed to mark a clear boundary between core computer science and the massification of computer use in the 1990s. As the faculty review group noted, very few users of Excel, for example, can write the code that lies behind Excel. The latter is the product of the study of computer science, not the former. A second set of major changes in the assignment and coding of courses following the recommendations of the external faculty review panels was in the taxonomy disciplinary field of Languages Other Than English. First, the study of American Sign Language (AMESLAN) was moved to this chapter from Allied Health Sciences/Services. The panel wished to distinguish between the acquisition of the formal language and the training of individuals for interpretation and assistance to the deaf (for the latter purposes, a code was maintained in Allied Health Sciences/ Services). Secondly, the panel recommended that courses that combined culture, history, and language be given separate codes within this chapter (e.g., \"Russian Culture/with Language\"), but only if taught in foreign language departments. Five new codes resulted from this recommendation. A third set of additions to the taxonomy codes resulted from the review panel on occupational fields. In Allied Health Sciences/Services, the taxonomy now recognizes a \"core\" general curriculum for allied health professionals consisting of General Medical Science, Health/Medical Information Resources, and the Social/Psychological/Cultural Components of Health Care. And codes for basic concepts of electricity and mechanics (as distinct from the presentations of these topics in engineering technology programs) under the defunct Industrial Arts section were moved to the field section covering installing, maintenance, and repair. All of these changes illustrate not only the continual refinement of a taxonomy, but also the shifting paths through which knowledge and skills are delivered to students. The story will not end with the Class of 1992."}, {"section_title": "PART 2:", "text": "The Empirical Core Curriculum There are at least three methods for measuring the comparative weight of different parts of the curriculum as experienced by students in U.S. higher education. All of them rely on a common currency of credits and credit-equivalents (such as clock hours that can be converted to credits). The first of these, a cluster-credit approach, is used in Principal Indicators (and in table 4.3 ), the companion document to The Empirical Curriculum. A large cluster of courses is defined, (e.g., Fine and Performing Arts or Upper-Level Laboratory Science), and the analytic metric is the number of undergraduate credits students earned within that cluster. The student is the unit of analysis. Appendix E lists 45 course-clusters created for the NELS:88/2000 (of which 19 were also used in both the NLS-72 and High School & Beyond/Sophomore cohort transcript analyses). These clusters are not mutually exclusive. For example, the course category for Non-Western Music is included in both the cluster for Fine and Performing Arts and the cluster for Non-Western Culture and Society. The course category for Environmental Chemistry is included in both the cluster for Upper-Level Laboratory Science and the cluster for Environmental Studies. The second method, proportional participation, is illustrated in detail in Part 3 of this document. It asks what percent of any defined group of students earned credits either in each of 600+ discrete course categories in the taxonomy of postsecondary courses derived from the cohort studies, or in 108 aggregate categories (see appendix D) that look like clusters but have tighter boundaries (e.g., U.S. History/American Civilization, Computer Programming, Graphics and Design). Proportional participation can also be presented in its mirror image: by the courses that enrolled the highest percentage of different groups of students. The third method involves credit ratios. For any group of students, all earned credits from all course categories are added. The total is a finite glass of 100 percent that becomes the denominator for subsequent calculations. These calculations ask what percent of the total credits earned by that group of students (the full glass) were earned in a particular course category. In each of the three grade-cohort longitudinal studies' postsecondary transcript files, there were over 1,000 course categories. For any one category to produce 0.5 percent of all credits earned by a group of students is a substantial amount. The unit of analysis is the course category. from the introduction of the elective system at Harvard by Charles Elliot, and continuing through its counterpoint, Robert Maynard Hutchins' consolidation of common curricula in the first two years of higher education at the University of Chicago (Levine 1981;Rudolph 1977). After a period of considerable growth and diffusion of curricula in 4-year colleges and fractures in the mission of 2-year colleges during the period 1965-1980, these arguments were born again, and in less elite contexts. While U.S. higher education is always undergoing experiments of one kind or another (Reisman and Grant 1978), the reform period of the 1980s was characterized by complaints that the curriculum had lost focus, that it was incoherent (Bennett 1984; the Association of American Colleges and Universities 1985;Boyer 1985;Cheney 1989) and that its bewildering presentation ultimately damaged student development (Study Group on the Conditions of Excellence in American Higher Education 1984). These arguments were normative. They were couched in terms of what students \"should\" study, requirements for degrees, and options for meeting those requirements. Their examples often came from college catalogs and faculty surveys, and sometimes, if they ventured into empirical waters, enrollment data provided by learned societies. With few exceptions, the combatants of the 1980s assumed that there was no core curriculum, no concentration of matter in the diffusion of knowledge in either 4-year or 2-year institutions. The Study Group on the Conditions of Excellence in American Higher Education that wrote Involvement in Learning for the U.S. Department of Education in 1984 recognized that the existing data available for analysis of curriculum and performance were limited, and called for the use of national transcript samples as the most objective, accurate, and potentially rich source of tracking curricular concentration, fragmentation, and change. Transcripts reflect what students actually do, not what a catalog says they might do. Transcripts also reveal a student's intensity of involvement with an academic subject through a very simple, time-honored accounting system for representing time-on-task: credits. Whatever one may think of credits as a currency, they can be used to demonstrate roughly how much time a generation of college students spent studying specific subjects such as statistics or finance or art history or electrical engineering, for example. To be sure, this accounting does not include credits attempted but not earned due to withdrawal or failure. Nor does it account for non-credit time or courses students audited. But the accounting can trace and help measure both concentration and diffusion in what students study-it can reveal the empirical core curriculum. For the high school classes of 1972, 1982, and 1992 the postsecondary transcript sample data can be structured to answer the question of how much time was spent studying different subjects about any group of students or any type of institution. The empirical core curriculum at moderately selective colleges, for example, looks very different from the empirical core curriculum at non-selective institutions (Adelman 1994). Other approaches using transcript samples can tell us what courses students in a given institution are most likely to \"share\" (Ratcliff 1992), and this is another reasonable approach to delineating the empirical core.

(NCES 2000-194), NELS:88/2000(NCES 2003. Table 2.1 illustrates this credit ratio approach by using the universes of bachelor's degree recipients in all three of the grade-cohort longitudinal studies. Bachelor's degree recipients were selected because they earned at least 120 undergraduate semester-credits, and their curricular experience spread across nearly all the course categories in the taxonomy, providing a rich and varied curricular landscape. The \"top 30\" courses were chosen to represent the core, and these 30 courses (slightly different for each of the three cohorts) out of over 1,000 produced roughly one-third of all the credits earned by bachelor's degree recipients in each of the cohorts. Twenty-one of the 30 course categories were common to the core curricular experience of bachelor's degree recipients in all three grade-cohorts, indicating considerable stability over the 28 years covered by the cohort histories (figure 2.1).  1972, 1982, and 1992  Ranks were established through the computation of percent of credits earned to four decimal places and the top 30 were selected in each cohort. Other courses where the percent of credits earned at four decimal places rounded to 0.6 were Business Law, General Management, and Art History for the Class of 1992, Introduction to Computer Science, Mechanical Engineering, Developmental Psychology, and Introduction to Philosophy for the Class of 1982, and World Geography, College Algebra, Pre-Calculus, Bible Studies, Elementary Education, and Introduction to Philosophy for the Class of 1972. 6 The bachelor's degree recipients in the NELS:88/2000 earned 127 million credits; the entire universe of those who earned more than 10 credits earned 181 million credits. 7 American Indians are not included due to the small sample size for this group. -27-and the rank position would have changed accordingly. 5 Other changes are the consequences of trends in student major, as set forth in table 2.2. For example, the proportion of bachelor's degree recipients who majored in Education dropped from 16 percent for the Class of 1972 to 7 percent for the Class of 1982, and rebounded to 9 percent for the Class of 1992. The course category covering student teaching (required of education majors) did not rank in the top 30 for the Class of 1982, but did rank in the top 30 in the histories of the other two cohorts. There were six business courses in the top 30 for the Class of 1982, and four in both the Class of 1972 and the Class of 1992, and that change mirrors the trend in the proportion of bachelor's degree recipients who received their degrees in business and allied fields. Table 2.2 is offered as a reference framework for the presentation of changes in course participation rates in tables 3.1 and 3.4. While students who earned bachelor's degrees constituted 46-49 percent of all students from all three cohorts who earned more than 10 credits (see Principal Indicators of Student Academic Histories in Postsecondary Education, table 2.1), in the Class of 1992, for example, they earned roughly 70 percent of the undergraduate credits earned by the more-than-10-credits (nonincidental students) group. 6 Their course-taking behavior thus has a disproportionate effect on participation rates in individual course categories. It should also be noted that, for the Class of 1992, credits earned by Advanced Placement (AP) examinations were coded separately, by subject. These were excluded from the calculations of the empirical core curriculum because (a) in the previous two cohorts, credits earned by examination were lumped in a single category and excluded from the calculations, and (b) credits earned by Advanced Placement are not post-matriculation credits. Table 2.3 takes the same universe used in table 2.1, except that it compares only the two most recent cohorts: the Class of 1982 and the Class of 1992, and asks, \"Given the top 30 courses in terms of credit ratio by bachelor's degree recipients in each of the major race/ethnicity groupings, what courses were held in common?\" Fourteen of the 30 were common to four race/ethnicity groups in both cohorts 7 and these 14 courses common to the experience of all four race/ethnicity groupings accounted for roughly one out of five credits earned by bachelor's degree recipients of each group over the past two decades. Appendix G goes beyond the courses held in common, presenting the top 30 in both cohorts for each of the four race/ethnicity groups.   1982 1992 1982 1992 1982 1992 1982 1992 Courses in common to four race/ethnicity groups in both grade cohorts 1.8 1.6 1.4 1.9 1.8 1.8 3.0 3.6 General Psychology 1.7 1.9 1.7 1.4 1.6 1.5 1.7 1.8 General Biology 1.3 1.7 1.4 1.9 1.3 1.7 1.0 1.3 1.3 1.5 1.0 1.4 1.1 1.0 Intro Accounting 1.7 1.0 1.4 0.9 1.7 0.8 1.3 0.9 Advanced Accounting 1.3 0.9 1.2 0.8 1.6 0.9 0.8 1.0 Total percent of credits: 21.9 20.9 22.0 23.0 22.5 22.3 24.6 24.3 Tables 2.4 and 2.5 enable the same kind of comparisons for men and women. For both the Class of 1982 and the Class of 1992, men and women held 23 courses in common among the top 30. Of these categories, 18 were the same in both cohorts. The differences reflect gender segmentation in engineering (the individual specialty categories for which-e.g., Electrical Engineering-produce many credits) and education. For men, only 3 of the 30 course categories changed from the Class of 1982 to the Class of 1992. For women, 7 categories changed. Four of the seven (Business Law, General Management, Marketing Management, and Finance for the Class of 1982) reflect the drop in the percentage of female bachelor's degree recipients majoring in business and allied fields from 23 percent for the Class of 1982 to 13 percent for the Class of 1992 (see table 2.2). 8 The comparative data on mean undergraduate credits earned for those who earned more than 10 credits but no credential and those who earned bachelor's degrees are as follows (with standard errors in parentheses): Class of 1982: more than 10 credits, no credential=42.5 (0.44); bachelor's degree=135.7 (0.43); Class of 1992: more than 10 credits, no credential=51.2 (1.39); bachelor's degree=138.3 (0.44). -30-   (NCES 2000-194), NELS:88/2000(NCES 2003. Table 2.6 takes up a very different population from bachelor's degree recipients: students who earned more than 10 undergraduate credits but no credential of any kind. Some of the same courses fill the slots of the \"top 30\" for these students as they did for bachelor's degree recipients (e.g., English Composition, General Psychology, Introductory Accounting, U.S. History surveys). This account for both the Class of 1982 and the Class of 1992 also includes occupationally-oriented course categories (Typing, Automobile Mechanics, Cosmetology). We should not assume any relationship between taking these courses and not completing credentials, rather that their presence on this de facto time-on-task list indicates a population with diverse goals in education/training. For both cohorts, the 30 courses accounted for a much higher percentage of total credits earned than was the case for bachelor's degree recipients, and for obvious reasons: students who do not earn any credentials earn far fewer credits overall. 8 9 Institutional selectivity for all three of the grade cohort postsecondary transcript studies was based on the descriptions used by the Cooperative Institutional Research Project (CIRP) in its annual production of The American Freshman (Los Angeles: UCLA). The 1977 edition was used for the NLS-72; the 1987 edition for the High School & Beyond/Sophomore cohort, and the 1992 edition for the NELS:88/2000. Selectivity was set in five broad bands: highly selective, selective, non-selective, open door, and not ratable (principally less than 2-year institutions and specialized \"conservatories\" of art and music). Where an institution did not participate in the CIRP surveys but was in an identifiable peer group or system, it was assigned the broad selectivity category of other institutions in the peer group or system. For the NELS:88/2000, where an institution was not in the 1992 edition of The American Freshman, five previous editions and five subsequent editions were used. For table 2.7 only those institutions that were rated and granted bachelor's degrees are included, hence the categories of \"open door\" (principally community colleges) and \"not ratable\" do not appear. -31- Table 2.7 displays the empirical core curriculum of bachelor's degree recipients from the Class of 1992 by selectivity of the institution awarding the bachelor's degree. The differences are the most dramatic of all comparisons offered in this section, with only 12 course categories out of 30 held in common by the three groups represented. The course list for students receiving bachelor's degrees from highly selective schools (7.2 percent of all bachelor's degrees for the Class of 1992) reflects a concentration of engineering and humanities majors, whereas those for students from selective schools (26.1 percent of bachelor's degrees) and non-selective schools (65.8 percent of bachelor's degrees) reflect a concentration of business majors. Of the items on these lists that depart from course categories listed on other tables in Section 2 and deserve special note are: \u2022 \"Architecture\" among the top 30 for selective institutions is a hint of where architectural education takes place in volume. The selective institutions include the vast majority of flagship state university campuses. \u2022 \"Student Teaching\" appears only on the list for non-selective schools, an indication of where school teachers are most likely to be trained."}, {"section_title": "Student Coursework by Enrollment Participation", "text": "This section switches gears in the metric of presentation. It offers considerable detail on the percentage of students from the three grade-cohort longitudinal studies who earned any credits in specific course categories and aggregates of course categories. Unlike the credit-ratio basis of the \"empirical core curriculum\" recounted in Part 2, credits are not added or weighted here, only cases in which the student earned credit. Unlike the credit-ratio basis of Part 2, this section does not describe percentages of credits earned, rather percentages of students who earned credits in specific subject matter. For analyses that indicate how much credit was earned in each category or in configurations of categories, one can invoke the curriculum credit-cluster approach employed in tables 5.5-5.8 of Principal Indicators of Student Academic Histories in Postsecondary Education, 1972-2000, the companion document to The Empirical Curriculum. One reason for offering these somewhat more lengthy lists is that the data may encourage inquiries into historical change in the delivered undergraduate curriculum (e.g., in business, psychology, communications, and economics). Has the undergraduate curriculum in communications become more theoretical? psychology more quantitative? If so, how and why did it happen? The transcript data cannot answer these questions, but they can aid and abet the directions of inquiry. Table 3.1 is the core of this presentation of student coursework. It covers 640 course categories, 10 and participation rates for two groups of students in each of the three cohorts: those who earned more than 10 credits and those who earned bachelor's degrees. If a student earned any credits-even fractional credits-in any of the courses included in a category, the student is counted. Thus, a half-credit symposium in U.S. Foreign Policy taken during a January term in a school on a trimester system has the same value as a three-credit course in the same subject in the Fall term. The student who takes four different courses that are coded under Clinical Psychology (code 420201) and earns 12 credits has the same value in this accounting as a student who completes only one course in that category. Failures, withdrawals, audits, and in-process courses are not included. Thus, this approach does not indicate the intensity or depth of a student's study in any one category, only the fact of participation. For details as to what courses are covered in each of the categories, the reader is referred to the on-line Taxonomy of Postsecondary Courses Based on the National Transcript Samples: 2003 that is included under the URL for this document. A brief outline of the fields and the range of categories covered by each is presented in appendix C."}, {"section_title": "Table 3.1: Percent of Three Cohorts of Students Earning Credits in 640 Course Categories", "text": "11 Setting a minimal enrollment threshold involved a somewhat arbitrary decision based on examining the 6 calculations (three cohorts x two groupings) of the percent of students who earned credits in over 900 course categories in which undergraduate instruction is offered (course categories under medicine and dentistry, for example, were not included), and excluding all categories for which none of the 6 calculations exceeded the median of 0.6 percent. None of the course categories in the field of the taxonomy for Building Trades and Transportation met this threshold criterion, and very few in the fields covering Mechanics and Repair and Precision Production met the criterion. There are rare exceptions. 12 The titles found most frequently under the code for Computer Science: Other, for example, include Computer Science Elective, Computer Science Seminar, Senior Project, and Problem-Solving. None of these indicate a discrete subject, so there is no analytic character to the category. 13 For bachelor's degree recipients in the Class of 1972, 10 percent completed coursework under the category of Computer Programming; for the Class of 1982, 25 percent. Given the adjustment to the taxonomy for the Class of 1992, the proportion fell to 17 percent. That sequence, 10-25-17, is not an accurate portrait of a trend in undergraduate study of computer programming. Table 3.4 combines these categories in an aggregate that renders the basis of participation between the Class of 1982 and Class of 1992 comparable. -38-Five hundred ten (510) of the categories selected were common to all three cohorts, but excluding (1) those with minimal enrollments, 11 (2) those designated as \"Other\" within fields (e.g., \"010199: Agricultural Business, Management & Marketing: Other\" or \"119999: Computer Science: Other\") 12 and, most importantly, (3) those categories where the definition of content changed significantly as a result of faculty review panel recommendations or disaggregations over the history of the three cohorts. The entire field of Computer Science is an example of the latter exclusion: there was such dynamic growth and change in the field between 1972 and 2000 that two faculty review panels sitting 6 years apart (1995 and 2001) recommended changes in categories and codes that rendered many categories not comparable across the three cohorts. For example, in the taxonomies used for the classes of 1972 and 1982, the course category covering \"Computer Programming\" included all computer languages. The faculty review panel for the class of 1992 recommended pulling out and assigning separate categories for Object-Oriented Languages (JAVA, C++, Visual Basic), FORTRAN, COBOL, and C Language. These are included in table 3.1. The residual category of Computer Programming for the class of 1992 is thus not comparable to its predecessors. The difference is substantial enough 13 so that it is excluded from table 3.1, but is included in aggregate form in table 3.4. Also included in table 3.1 are 45 categories common to the Class of 1982 (High School & Beyond/Sophomores) and the Class of 1992 (NELS:88/2000) only. These 45 categories did not exist in the taxonomy for the Class of 1972. There are also 75 categories new and unique to the NELS:88/2000 and for which enrollments exceeded minimal thresholds. For a full list of the course categories new to the NELS:88/2000, see appendix H. Table 3.1"}, {"section_title": "Pointers for Reading", "text": "(1) The course categories are arranged in the order of the disciplinary and sub-disciplinary fields of the 1985 Classification of Instructional Programs, and as subsequently modified over the course of three iterations of The College Course Map (1990Map ( , 1995Map ( , and 1999. Appendix C provides an overview of the 50 fields and the range of their disciplinary coverage in the 2003 taxonomy. (2) Categories and codes in bold type are new to the taxonomy with the transcript files of the NELS:88/2000 (high school class of 1992). The symbol for \"not applicable\" (^) in the NLS-72 (high school class of 1972) and High School & Beyond/Sophomore (high school class of 1982) columns indicate that the course category and code did not exist for that cohort, though the course titles included under new category may have previously been contained in another category. For example, for the Class of 1992, what was previously a single code/category for Linguistics (230601) became four categories: General Linguistics (230601), Syntax and Grammar (230602), Phonetics and Phonology 230603, and Sociolinguistics (230604). While the course-taking volume for Sociolinguistics did not meet the threshold criteria and is not included in table 3.1, the other new categories are included. (3) As a guide to estimating the number of students earning credits in a course category within 8.5 years of the modal high school graduation date for the cohort, the weighted numbers for each cohort can be multiplied by the percentage of students indicated. The weighted Ns are: All students earning All students earning more than 10 credits bachelor's degrees Class of 1972Class of (1972Class of -1980 1.48M 674k Class of 1982Class of (1982Class of -1990 1.79M 737k Class of 1992Class of (1992Class of -2000 1.84M 916k Thus, for an example of a minimum case, if 4.2 percent of the postsecondary students from the Class of 1992 who earned more than 10 credits completed a course in Shakespeare, that is roughly 77,000 students from that cohort. For an example of a more substantial case, if 13.4 percent of students in the Class of 1982 who earned more than 10 credits successfully completed a course in Art History (code 500703, covering all periods, all genres), the estimate comes out to approximately 240,000 students from that cohort over 8.5 years of postsecondary history following its modal high school graduation date (June, 1982). It is important to note that these are not national enrollment estimates. Each estimate covers an 8.5-year period, with variable attendance intensity by students during that period. (4) Since the student is the unit of analysis in table 3.1, traditional measures of statistical significance apply, and since the universe of students in all three cohorts was cut to match (12 th graders in the year scheduled, and 8.5 years of postsecondary course-taking and degrees following the modal high school graduation date), t-tests can be performed across the cohorts using Taylor-series standard errors. Some comparisons of participation rates are, prima facie, insignificant. For example, the sequence for bachelor's degree participation in courses on Shakespeare (code 230802) across the three cohorts of 7.2 percent, 7.3 percent, and 7.1 percent is such that the judgment of \"no significant change\" can be applied. Given the volume of participation, the sequences for Public Speaking & Debate (code 090202), on the other hand, evidence a steady rise across the three cohorts in the proportion of students earning credits in this category. Whether the changes from cohort to cohort are significant, however, is subject to significance testing. For each course category, table 3.1 indicates which of the seven permutations of change across the three cohorts is statistically significant, and the reader is directed to figure 3.1 below and the footnotes for table 3.1 for guidance on the application of significance tests to each of the course categories. (5) Changes in course participation rates may be affected by the way in which institutions offer certain topics. The rates for the Sociology of Race/Ethnicity (code 451103), for example, could be affected by the offering of more interdisciplinary approaches to Ethnicity (code 050210) and/or Multiculturalism/Diversity (code 307001). Fluctuations in participation rates also could be affected by evolving standards in specialized accrediting bodies (e.g., the American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business). It is not the role of this document to explain intra-field modulations or other shifting balances among related subjects, rather to provide the data that will stimulate researchers to advance and test hypotheses concerning those fluctuations that strike them as significant. It is for this reason that caveats about the changing boundaries of course categories and institutional credit practices are offered. (6) Taylor-series standard errors were computed for all estimates in table 3.1, and t-tests performed on every pair of estimates for each course category. For both the 510 course categories that appear in all three data sets on which table 3.1 draws and the 45 course categories in which only two cohorts were comparable (the Class of 1982 versus the Class of 1992), the critical t of 1.96 was used for pairwise cohort comparisons. The reader should be aware that 5 percent of the significant findings may be the result of Type I error. The values in the columns for \"Significance Code\" (abbreviated \"Sig. Code\") are as follows:  1972 vs. 1982, and 1982 vs. 1992 5 Two comparisons are significant: 1972 vs. 1982, and 1972 vs. 1992 6 Two comparisons are significant: 1982 vs. 1992, and 1972 vs. 1992 7 All three possible pair comparisons are significant Not applicable 14 Covers non-remedial \"freshman composition\" and comparable titles for courses designed to ensure college-level writing skills. -41-Observations on Table 3.1 What kinds of conclusions can be reached when these indications of statistical significance of change are applied across the three grade cohorts in table 3.1? It is very important to note, first, that the examples cited below are confined to cases where, in at least one of the three grade cohorts, 5 percent or more of the bachelor's degree recipients earned credits in the category. This threshold isolates comparisons that are potentially meaningful from those that are merely statistically significant. For analysts who wish to delve further into the substantive importance of differences, the Web posting for this document also includes the spreadsheet tables for the approximately 3,500 estimates and their standard errors that were computed for table 3.1, and from which standard deviations can be derived.\n(2) (3) Unlike the presentation of table 3.1, Western Civ/Heritage titles are split out from World Civ titles to match the differentiation recommended by external review panels for the 2003 taxonomy. (4) In addition to presenting a rank order of these 100 courses by percentage of students who earned credits in each of the categories, table 3.2 indicates the weighted number of students who earned at least a fraction of a credit in each category, and also (and more importantly) the average number of credits earned by students in each of the 100 categories. This latter feature allows the reader to judge the true weight of student curricular participation. For example, while 29.8 percent of the NELS:88/2000 students earned some credit for aerobics/jogging/body-building/ conditioning/cross-training, and while they may have taken \"courses\" in this category 5, 6 or 7 times, the average number of credits earned was 1.81. Compare these data to those for Introduction to Economics (usually presented as a Micro/Macro Economics 2-semester sequence), with a comparable enrollment share of 30.0 percent, but with average earned credits of 4.9. (5) The average credits feature also assists the judgment of remediation and academic standards. For example, while 13.5 percent of the students who earned more than 10 credits in the NELS:88/2000 cohort earned credits of any kind in remedial English/writing, 16 the average number of \"credits\" earned was 0.4.\n(1) Full course category titles (as opposed to abbreviations) are used here. (2) Note that, unlike tables 3.1 and 3.2, the data for the 35 categories in this table are for enrollments, not successful completions, so the average credits earned include failures and nocredit-repeats (NCRs)-i.e., cases where no credits were earned. 17 By the end of June 1993, a year after the modal high school graduation date for the NELS:88/2000 cohort, 48.3 percent of all remedial courses taken by students who continued their education after high school had been completed. 18 English Composition, General Psychology, College Algebra, Intro to Sociology, U.S. History Surveys, Physical Education Activities, Freshman Orientations, Oral Communication, Introduction to Computing, Western Civilization/Heritage, Personal Health Information, and Academic/Study Skills. 19 While not shown in the table, 4.9 percent of first-year community college students enrolled in General Humanities courses, which might be considered a proxy substitute for literature and philosophy. -75-Observations on Table 3.3 In the data set forth in table 3.3 for all students the reader will note four themes, reflecting configurations of courses that draw a comparatively high percentage of students, though yield a wide range of credits earned: \u2022 general education, the core distribution requirements at many institutions reflected in the positions of General When comparing enrollment rates for community college students in their first year of attendance to those of the entire cohort, the following can be marked: \u2022 there are no differences in enrollment rates in 12 of the 35 courses; 18 \u2022 higher proportions of first-year community college students enrolled in precollegiate courses in mathematics, and lower proportions in pre-calculus and calculus; this contrast, along with comparative enrollment rates in Remedial English/Writing and Remedial Reading, confirms the dominant role of community colleges in remediation for entering postsecondary students (Bailey and Averianova, 1998) given the extent of participation of community college students in remedial work during the first year, lower enrollment rates in General Biology, General Chemistry, Introduction to Economics, Introduction to Philosophy, and general courses in literature are not surprising; 19 \u2022 first-year community college students evidence higher enrollment rates than the entire cohort in the only business-related courses on the list: Introductory Accounting and Introduction to Business; \u2022 the sub-theme of music course work is not evident in the first year enrollment rates of community college students.

In that group of 33 course categories, one counts introductions to literature, theater, and philosophy, music appreciation and art history, comparative religions, and ethics, for example. In the same bracket, too, one notes two remedial courses (basic Algebra and remedial English/writing), three core math courses (statistics, pre-calculus, and calculus), and five business courses. The balance ranges from personal service courses (orientations, Personal Health Information) to psychology courses that usually list General Psychology as a prerequisite.

Table 3.3 takes the same approach as does table 3.2, but, using the NELS:88/2000, confines the temporal dimensions of course-taking and average credits earned to the first true calendar year of enrollment, and covers all students for whom a true first date of attendance could be determined (including those who ended up earning 10 or fewer credits). The 35 course categories enrolling more than 4 percent of the students, by percentage of participating students were selected to illustrate what is most likely to happen in the first year of attendance that may affect student persistence to the second year. A second part of table 3.3 is confined to students whose first institution of attendance was a community college, and provides the enrollment rates of these students during their first true calendar year of attendance in the same 35 course categories (but only those enrollments that took place in community colleges)."}, {"section_title": "Table 3.3: Course Participation in the First Year of Postsecondary Education", "text": "A \"true\" first date of attendance excludes (a) dates of postsecondary course-taking prior to high school graduation; (b) attendance during the summer term between high school graduation and the fall semester (unless the institution was the same for both the summer and fall terms); and (c) false starts, that is, the scenario in which a student enrolls in an institution and registers for courses, but either drops or withdraws from most-if not all-course work in the first term of attendance, only to start at another institution at a later point in time and pursue a credit-yielding curriculum. In this illustration, it is the second institution and its starting date that is the true first institution and true first date of attendance. This definition was used in all three grade-cohort longitudinal studies' postsecondary transcript files. The effects of the first postsecondary year have been a staple of higher education research on retention and attainment for a quarter century (starting with Astin1977), but none of the major national surveys focused on the first year experience of postsecondary students has had access to course-taking data at the discrete level of transcript-based accounts such as those revealed in table 3.3. Furthermore, the NCES longitudinal studies that include such transcript data obtain it from all schools attended by students in their first year, including sub-baccalaureate institutions that are represented either inadequately or not at all in other data sources (e.g., Barefoot 2001). Researchers and policy analysts are invited to include the information on course-taking in the first calendar year of postsecondary experience in two dimensions: first, to look backwards toward secondary school curricular momentum in specific subjects (for example, to take the students who enrolled in Basic Algebra, Developmental Mathematics, Intermediate Algebra, College Algebra, Pre-Calculus, and Calculus, and chart their mathematics course-taking in high school) to develop and test models of enrollment management (including planning for faculty staffing). Table 3.3"}, {"section_title": ".5, and 3.6: A Macro Presentation of Course Participation Rates", "text": "There are 1,178 codes in the 2003 CCM taxonomy. Of these, 1,145 apply to course-taking in specific fields. Another 19 cover credit-by-examination (Advanced Placement, CLEP, departmental examinations, state basic skills exams), 9 are functional codes (for example, for imputed credit blocks, unclassifiable course titles, journal entries), and 5 describe generic academic activities with fields unspecified (for example, study abroad credit blocks, cooperative education, independent study). Tables 3.4 through 3.6 are built on 108 aggregates of the 1,145 course categories (see appendix D for details on the categories covered in each aggregate). 20 Their primary focus is on the High School Class of 1992 (the NELS:88/2000 cohort), and they limit their universes to those who earned more than 10 credits. \u2022 Table 3.4 asks what percentage of all 12 th graders who subsequently earned more than10 undergraduate credits in both the NELS:88/2000NELS:88/ (1992NELS:88/ -2000 and the High School & Beyond/Sophomore cohort (1982)(1983)(1984)(1985)(1986)(1987)(1988)(1989)(1990) 21 earned credits in each of the 108 categories? \u2022 Table 3.5 asks the same question, by gender, but only for the Class of 1992 (the NELS:88/2000 cohort). \u2022 Table 3.6 asks the same question, by race/ethnicity, but only for the Class of 1992. Pointers for Reading Tables 3.4, 3.5, and 3.6 (1) All three tables are organized by type of curriculum/program, not by an alphabetical list of fields: Occupational (2) With this more finite presentation of the categories of table 3.1, standard errors of the estimates were computed so that the reader can judge whether the differences in participation rates of sub-groups are statistically significant. The technical guide for judgment is presented in appendix B. The inter-cohort (high school classes of 1992 and 1982) and gender judgments are noted in tables 3.4 and 3.5; the judgments by race/ethnicity based on table 3.6 are provided in appendix I due to space constraints. (3) In applying standard tests of statistical significance to inter-cohort comparisons between the 12 th graders of 1992 and those of 1982 (table 3.4), please note that \u2022 five aggregates for the 1992 group (NELS:88/2000) did not exist in the configuration for the 1982 group (High School & Beyond/Sophomores), and four other aggregates were so significantly reconstructed than comparisons between the two cohorts cannot be made. An example of the former is the aggregate for business IT and quantitative methods, that, for the 1992 group includes a major new course category in Management of Information Systems, and for which all other course categories were \"pulled\" from \"Business & Management: Other.\" An example of the latter is nutrition, which includes course categories from clinical health sciences, health/physical education/recreation (HPER), and what was previously called \"academic home economics.\" \u2022 changes in the participation rates in six aggregates were partly due to minor modifications within the boundaries of the aggregate. For example, crime studies/services for the 1992 cohort includes new course categories in the Psychology of Crime and Juvenile Delinquency. The inverse changes in participation rates in data and computer applications and computer science reflect the reconstruction of the latter at the advice of an external faculty review panel. Observations on Tables 3.4, 3.5, and 3.6 (1) In applying standard tests of statistical significance to inter-cohort comparisons between the 12 th graders of 1992 and those of 1982, and including only those aggregate categories with at least a 10 percent participation rate in at least one of the two cohorts, table 3.4 reveals \u2022 increases in participation in such fields as environment and natural resources, special education, teacher education subjects, health services: other, crime studies and services, general biology, calculus and advanced math, Spanish language, ethics, ethnic and culture studies, women's studies, anthropology, graphics and design, and theater and dance. The largest percentage increases 22 within these groups are: ethnic and culture studies (335 percent), generalized introductions to science (118 percent), women's studies (112 percent), Spanish language (57 percent), ethics (55 percent), crime studies and services (54 percent), environment and natural resources (54 percent), and data and computer applications (54 percent). 23 The proportion of all women who earned bachelor's degrees who majored in a specific field divided by the proportion of all men who earned bachelor's degrees who majored in the same field. While based on degrees, this ratio sets convincing parameters for the judgment of gender differences in participation at the course-aggregate level. 24 For bachelor's degrees awarded in 1999-2000, for example, the female field concentration ratios would range from 0.09 for engineering technologies and 0.195 for engineering to 1.82 for foreign languages, 2.35 for education, and 3.89 for health sciences and services (computed on the basis of Snyder 2001, table 269, p. 328). -79-"}, {"section_title": "PART 4:", "text": "Undergraduate Curriculum by Occupation: The Case of School Teachers From the High School Class of 1992 The data sets for all three grade-cohort longitudinal studies allow the analyst to take any group, by occupation in the penultimate year of the study, and describe the curriculum they brought to that occupation. The case of school teachers is particularly noteworthy because they come to their profession from different undergraduate majors, and sometimes do not seek to qualify for certification until after they earn a bachelor's degree. For those concerned with the curricular background of school teachers-that is, the extent of their own study of subjects they teach-the transcript data are only partially illuminating, and a warning to this effect should be placed in the first paragraph of this section. The reason is simple: the 4 th Follow-up (2000) NELS survey asked only about occupation and industry, not specific job tasks. We thus do not know what subjects the school teachers in this cohort were assigned. There are a number of ways of setting boundaries for the universe of school teachers (see, e.g., Henke, Geis, and Giambattista 1996). In The New College Course Map and Transcript Files (2 nd edition, 1999), the universe for curriculum analysis of teachers in the High School & Beyond/Sophomore cohort was defined to include both actual and \"potential\" school teachers. A potential school teacher was defined as one who, though not working as a school teacher in 1991 (the penultimate year for that longitudinal study), had either (a) majored in education as an undergraduate; (b) majored in another subject but took 12 or more credits in education, including student teaching; or (c) took 12 or more credits in education and indicated, at age 20 (1984), that school teaching was a potential or likely occupation for them at age 30. In the High School & Beyond/Sophomore cohort, 64 percent of those within the universe were employed as school teachers in 1991. The NELS:88/2000 postsecondary transcript files allow for a variation on these definitions that takes post-baccalaureate coursework into account, along with statements of intention with respect to occupational status at age 30. For example, analysis can isolate those who were working as school teachers at age 26 or 27 in 2000 who said they had no intention of remaining as school teachers at age 30, those who prepared to be school teachers but had no intention of entering the profession, and those who were not working as school teachers at age 26 or 27 but were preparing to do so by age 30. Using the same approach as was employed for the High School & Beyond/Sophomore cohort, 66 percent of the universe of NELS:88/2000 students who prepared to be school teachers said they were working as school teachers in 1999. For purposes of describing curricular backgrounds, the universe chosen for the tables in this section is confined to those who reported working as teachers in 2000, 25 thus providing a sharper focus on the training they brought to the classroom. The tables will suggest, though, that when the NELS:88/2000 respondents indicated they were school teachers, the occupational territory extends beyond that of public schools to both religious schools and to music pedagogy that includes part-time school-based teaching. Since nearly all the NELS:88/2000 teachers said they had been certified or received a license to teach, the last of these groups (those whose records indicated no coursework in education) may include those working with emergency certifications and religious school teachers, but the data set does not allow for further detail on these alternatives. Nor, unfortunately, does the data set allow us to separate elementary and secondary school teachers with confidence, since the questions asked about occupation, industry, and principal duties were open-ended. Responses to those questions were literal, with no consistency in terms. Table 4.2 applies the same credit-ratio approach to the records of the NELS:88/2000 school teachers as was invoked in Part 2, and produces the top 30 course categories in terms of percentage of total credits earned-their empirical core curriculum. The presence of course categories of Bible Study and Theology in the top 30, both with an average of more than 7 credits, suggests that religious school teachers are definitely included in the universe; and the weight of credits in the Music Performance implies that music teachers working in multiple settings are included as well (if the list went to the top 50 course categories, it would also show Music Theory and Music Literature). Of the 30 courses listed in table 4.2, 10 are in education, 1 is a mathematics service course for prospective school teachers, and 16 others are among the empirical core curriculum of all bachelor's degree recipients in the NELS:88/2000 cohort (see table 2.1). 26 Had the universe been limited to education majors who earned bachelor's degrees, the empirical core would have accounted for 49.4 percent of earned undergraduate credits (separate calculation; not in table 4.2). But, as has been pointed out, not all education majors became school teachers and only half of those who became school teachers were undergraduate education majors. 27 The empirical core applies only to credits earned prior to the award of the bachelor's degree. The 66 percent participation rate in Student Teaching shown in table 4.2 excludes the 15 percent of teachers who completed their student teaching requirements after earning the bachelor's degree. -95-The empirical core for school teachers in the NELS:88/2000 accounted for 42.1 percent of all undergraduate credits earned. 26 Student teaching, the required professional internship, no doubt affects the apparent concentration. 27 Analysts may wish to compare teachers with respect to the credit weight of internships to those in other occupations requiring pre-service practice as a condition of licensure. Table 4.3 takes a different view of the undergraduate curriculum of the NELS:88/2000 school teachers in terms of the number of credits they earned in different curricular clusters of particular relevance for educators. These distributions hint at depth of study in these curriculum areas, hence the potential content knowledge brought to the school classroom. Not all school teachers are science teachers, but approximately 15 percent of the NELS:88/2000 school teachers took more than 4 credits in upper division laboratory science, and 41 percent earned 11 or more credits at all levels of science. Not all school teachers are history teachers, but approximately one out of five in the NELS:88/2000 group earned 11 or more credits in history (i.e., at least four undergraduate courses). Not all school teachers are responsible for foreign language instruction or teach students from second language backgrounds, but roughly one out of six earned 11 or more credits in foreign languages. It may also be worth noting that 42 percent of teachers earned no credits in computer-related subjects. Table 4.4 asks what school teachers studied after they earned a bachelor's degree, confines the universe to those students who earned any credits after the bachelor's degree, and presents the results in terms of enrollment participation (as in Part 3) in the top 20 courses by percentage of students who earned credits in each. This table consists exclusively of education courses, implying that the population was dominated by those preparing for initial certification, pursuing graduate degrees in education, or engaging in in-service continuing education.

What was learned in the initial presentation of the High School & Beyond/Sophomore cohort data is that, over time, users of the restricted data files find errors in course coding that the editorial process did not catch, ask for revisions in some of the variables derived from the coding (for example, aggregate categories or clusters), and suggest both new derived variables and other ways of configuring the data. There was a 2nd edition of The New College Course Map and Transcript Files and the CD containing the data on which it relied. The original CD, NCES 98-135, was replaced by NCES 2000-194. It is anticipated that the same process will hold for the NELS:88/2000CD (NCES 2003 on which The Empirical Curriculum draws. The data presentations in this document selected large and well-defined universes of students-for example, bachelor's degree recipients, and all who earned more than 10 undergraduate credits. But the same type of data-for example, the \"empirical core\" or course enrollment share-can be rendered for sub-populations and combinations of sub-populations and institutional type. Thus, for example, one could present these analyses for: \u2022 community college coursework for all students who began their postsecondary careers in community colleges, \u2022 first year (and total) undergraduate coursework for students with a high degree of curricular momentum in science and mathematics from high school, or \u2022 first year coursework for students who did not return for the second year (even if they stopped out and returned at a later point in time) and never earned a degree. As the brief presentation and analysis of the coursework of school teachers suggests, analysts can work backwards from occupational status into the substance of formal postsecondary schooling to determine the shape and depth of knowledge brought to the labor market. From other features of postsecondary histories (for example, types and sequences of schools attended), this type of analysis can illuminate multiple pathways to occupations. Granted, these approaches use markers of education as proxies for knowledge, and beg the difference between knowledge and skill, particularly in mid-level technical fields (Scarselletta 1997), but they still provide strong outlines. These, and other, cases depend on the construction of a course-based file, in which, attached to every case of course-taking can be dozens of variables drawn from student and institutional characteristics files and from high school transcript files. All of these files are on the restricted CDs for the three grade-cohort studies used in The Empirical Curriculum. The course-based files are very large and slow to process, but worth the effort. NLS-72 and HS&B/Sophomore cohort than they were for the NELS:88/2000. Military records exist for the NLS-72 but not for any subsequent study. Student financial aid information included an unobtrusive Pell Grant file for the HS&B/Sophomore cohort, and that for the NELS:88/2000 included data from the National Student Loan Data System (though this file has not proven to be very helpful 29 ). Lastly, the shift from paper-and-pencil survey response forms to computer-assisted telephone interviews (CATI) in the1990s constricted the range of questions asked (e.g., there was no time to ask students about reasons for changing majors, reasons for transferring from one college to another, and degrees of satisfaction with different aspects of postsecondary experience), whereas the NLS-72 paper survey forms covered these topics in some depth. Nonetheless, the archives of these data sets are the richest we have to explore the nature of secondary and postsecondary education and its consequences in the early adult life histories of Americans over the past 30 years. different numbers of credits and different grades on each occasion. Ten-and only 10-students out of 9,000 may take a dozen courses in the same broad category (for example, chiropractic) and earn 10 credits in each of them. All these cases render the tasks of weighting the data and determining its accuracy more difficult. In fact, these cases illustrate the differences between analysis of transcripts and analysis of survey responses. The descriptive comparisons in The Empirical Curriculum dealing with non-repetitive student behaviors require invocation of the \"Students' t\" statistic to determine whether the difference between two independent estimates is significant. The formula for computing Students' t values is: _ (P 1 -P 2 )____ t = % (se 1 2 + se 2   2   )where P 1 and P 2 are the estimates to be compared and se 1 and se 2 are the corresponding standard errors. In this case, if t> 1.96, one has a statistically significant difference at p<.05, a standard marker. For the judgments of statistical significance in tables 3.1, 3.4, 3.5 and 3.6 of The Empirical Curriculum, an Excel template developed by MPR Associates for the production of reports to the National Center for Education Statistics, was used. When estimates are not independent, a covariance term must be added to the Students' t formula where r is the correlation between the two estimates. The determination of correlations requires a statistical software package such as SAS or SPSS and the invocation of proper weights for the comparison. Because none of the three grade-cohort longitudinal studies used in both The Empirical Curriculum and Principal Indicators was based on a simple random sample of students, the technique for estimating sampling error involves a more complex approach known as the Taylor series method. To produce Taylor series standard errors, the estimates presented in both The Empirical Curriculum and Principal Indicators used AM, a program developed by Jon Cohen and associates at the American Institutes for Research under contract to the National Center for Education Statistics."}, {"section_title": "Flags and Weights", "text": "Each of the grade cohort studies used in The Empirical Curriculum carries a complex set of flags and weights to mark the populations for which estimates are to be generated. The selection of these flags and weights is very important for both the accuracy and meaningfulness of estimates. For purposes of the topics covered in The Empirical Curriculum, the oldest of the data sets, the NLS-72, is the least complicated. One weight was developed for the postsecondary transcript sample. This weight was based on the fourth follow-up survey sample (in 1979) when students were asked what postsecondary institutions they had attended up to that point, when they attended, what degrees they had earned, and so forth. After the transcripts were gathered in 1984 and the first postsecondary transcript files developed, a flag was added to limit the population to those for whom transcripts were received. The analyses of NLS-72 data in The Empirical Curriculum use WT1 and set INPETS=1. A separate flag for 12 th grade status in 1972 is not necessary because everyone in the NLS-72 was in the 12 th grade in 1972. For the postsecondary transcript sample of the High School & Beyond/Sophomore cohort, the process was more complex. Using the weights for the first follow-up survey (1982, the scheduled 12 th grade year for this cohort), three postsecondary transcript weights were developed. The first was based on a ratio of the sum of weights for all students in the 1982 panel who subsequently (in surveys of 1984, 1986 or 1992) claimed to have attended a postsecondary institution to the sum of weights for those for whom a transcript validating the claim was subsequently received. The ratio was then modified by factors derived from the stratification cells in the 1982 survey design to create multipliers that were applied to the raw weights for the students for whom transcripts were received or for whom postsecondary attendance imputed from survey story-line characteristics. This is a generous formulation for all likely postsecondary participants. The second High School & Beyond/Sophomore weight involved the same procedure as the first but a more restrictive ratio applied to those students for whom a true postsecondary transcript was received. These students are more than \"likely\" participants: they are \"known participants.\" The third weight followed the same procedure as the second, but confined the population to only those students with complete postsecondary records (i.e., no missing transcripts). This weight is used in analyses of credit production and grades, since complete records are necessary for the analysis of both these features of student academic history. These weights are labeled PSEWT1, PSEWT2, and PSEWT3. To accompany these weights for the comparisons that hold the population to students who were in the 12 th grade in 1982, a special flag, SENRFLAG, was constructed from variables in the HS&B/So that described student status in 1982. Using the given flag for participation in the 1982 cohort sample would be insufficient and not wholly accurate, as that would include students who graduated early from high school in 1981, for example. But there were also students who were labeled \"early graduates\" on the data set (and thus candidates for exclusion from a 12 th grade flag) whose high school graduation date was listed as 1982. These erroneously labeled \"early graduates\" were thus included in the population with SENRFLAG=1. For all calculations of HS&B/So data in The Empirical Curriculum, SENRFLAG=1, and the appropriate PSE weight invoked. The weights and flags for the NELS:88/2000 are more complex, still, because the cohort, established in the 8 th grade, was \"refreshed\" twice: first, to be representative of the census of 10 th graders in 1990, and second, to be representative of the census of 12 th graders in 1992. The weights deriving from the 1992 12 th grade refreshing are at the core of weights subsequently developed for the postsecondary transcript sample. The same three postsecondary weight types developed for the High School & Beyond/Sophomores were employed here, but in combination with the 12th grade (second Follow-up survey, or F2) weight and the student's presence in the final (2000) survey panel, F4. In addition, a set of weights based on the NELS high school transcripts in combination with the three postsecondary weight types was also developed to be invoked when questions arise concerning the relationship between secondary school variables derived from high school transcripts and postsecondary variables derived from postsecondary transcripts. The NELS:88/2000 weights used in The Empirical Curriculum are: F4F2P2WT For all known postsecondary participants who were 12 th graders in 1992 F4F2P3WT For all postsecondary participants with complete records who were 12 th graders in 1992 As in the case of the High School & Beyond/Sophomore cohort, a special flag was developed for 12 th graders in 1992. The existing flag on the NELS:88/2000 files excluded over 300 students who, in fact, were awarded high school diplomas in the spring of 1992. These students are included in the flag, GRADE12A, used in The Empirical Curriculum. The weighted Ns for all samples used in a table are provided in the notes to the table. Even if the same weight and flag is used on two tables, the weighted Ns may differ slightly because missing values in a particular variable are excluded from the calculations.

University faculty are usually not fluent in the curricular offerings in those other areas. Community college faculty, on the other hand, often know both types of areas and can make clear distinctions between them. C While we inherited the taxonomy, we know it is always in motion, driven by the empirical evidence of the transcripts. The computer applications courses of the 1980s, placed under Computer Science (section 1106), are now scattered to the four winds, and offered directly by a range of departments or offered under computer science, but with highly specialized titles. To plant the flag of a discrete computer application in a new territory requires both a measured defense and the empirical evidence of the transcripts. Thus, for example, we have opened up a code in the Graphic Arts series (5004) for titles such as Digital Illustration and Computer Graphic Design, and they have been moved out of the Computer Science category \"Computer Applications: Other Fields\" (110604). \"Computer Graphics,\" as an upper-level computer science course, stays in Computer Science."}, {"section_title": "C", "text": "The sample of students whose coursework drives the taxonomy and its applications is a restricted national sample. That is, the students were selected in the 8 th grade in 1988. They were scheduled to graduate from high school in 1992. We see whatever they did in postsecondary education by the end of the year 2000, when they were, at the most, 26/27 years old. As a group, they attended nearly 2,900 institutions-and of all kinds, including trade schools, hospital schools, and seminaries. So we have one age cohort whose educational histories are censored in time, but not space. We see less of graduate education and more of sub-baccalaureate vocational education than we might otherwise assume. We see more of course work in the period 1992-1997 than we do of the period 1998-2000. The upshot? The cutting edge courses in your 2001 graduate programs won't qualify for this taxonomy.\nSince the first empirical taxonomy was produced a decade ago, we have held to a \"threshold rule\" for inclusion: unless the number of course-taking cases exceeds .00005 of the total number of courses in the database, the category cannot stand as a discrete entity, rather must be merged with another. The current sample will have approximately 350,000 net (after removing transfer courses) course entries. The threshold is thus 17. There are exceptions to the rule (e.g., less commonly taught foreign languages), but every exception requires strong justification. What we've done in the physical sciences is to \"park\" titles of less commonly-taken courses in holding bin codes, e.g., 400509 (Chemistry: Other Discrete Topics) until we see whether they will meet the threshold. When they do (e.g., Environmental Chemistry certainly will meet the criterion for this cohort), they will be given their own code slot.\nIn making decisions where more than one designation is possible, coders are instructed to look at context: what kind of school is this? what else is the individual studying? how many credits are attached to this course? what's the local course number? A 1-credit course in Database Applications in a sub-baccalaureate institution for a student in an office-support curriculum is not the same creature as a 3-credit Database Applications course for a computer science major at the state university. Pharmacology, for example, is now in three different places in the taxonomy: biological sciences as \"Pharmacology,\" clinical health sciences (the service territory of which covers some aspects of medical education) as \"Clinical Pharmacology,\" and allied health sciences, where it is included in a code covering pharmacy technology. For a more extreme example, cosmetology students take a 12-hour course called \"Chemistry.\" Do we code that in the 4005 series? Enough said.\nThe taxonomy cannot settle local disputes over who teaches what, rather should reflect national trends or dominant practice, and should have clear decision rules. A good example encompasses the various biopsychology titles, a field of departmental turf wars since the 1970s. We have two umbrella categories, Physiological Psych (421101) and Neuroscience (260608), that can accommodate these titles. Usually, coders have no problem, but a course entitled \"Brain and Behavior\" can fall in either one. In that case, we yield to the local designation-and that's our decision rule! C In the initial coding of this generation of transcripts, all existing course categories, including those listed in The New College Course Map as \"DELeted\" or \"SUSpended\" are in play. The DEL and SUS labels were based on the evidence of the previous decade's coursework, and we knew at the time that these decisions were not forever. We already know, for example, that certain less commonly taught foreign languages that did not qualify even under suspension of the threshold rules for the 1995 version of the CCM will be back in the 2003 edition.\nThe interdisciplinary codes (30 series) have been carefully chosen so that (a) the series does not become a dumping ground, (b) major coursework that crosses academic continents can be identified (e.g. Science, Technology & Society), and (c) new metadisciplinary fields have a place to grow (e.g., Women's Studies).\nThe existing taxonomy has about 1,100 potential codes that can be aggregated into about 105 large course categories for time-series analyses. Both numbers have proven manageable when one asks such questions as \"What proportion of students successfully complete a course in X?\" and \"How has that changed since . . . .?\"-and asks both questions by gender or race/ethnicity. The more categories, the less manageable and statistically significant the analyses. C I am the first to acknowledge discomfort in the historical placement of some major course categories (e.g., public speaking in English and biochemistry in biology). Simply because we inherited these positions from the decisions of previous panels does not mean they are set in stone. Are these the right ones? Should 400530 be lumped with Organic Biochem? Pre-Chemistry/Preparatory Chemistry can usually be justified by virtue of less than 4 credits and followed (on a student's record) by a General Chem course. Are these the right kinds of criteria for placement? Physics 1. The introductory sequence seems to be a fairly straightforward matter, e.g. when you see freshmen and sophomores taking a set of courses entitled Mechanics, E&M, Thermo, and Modern Physics, you know it's the intro course, whether spread over 3 quarters or 4 semesters, but . . .the 4-semester sequence is very different from something labeled Physics 111-112 (\"College Physics\") that isn't physics for poets. Should we try to distinguish the intro sequences? If so, how? Mathematics 1. This panel should be concerned with what has happened in the study of mathematics in higher education during the 1990s. It would be helpful if you scanned the codes and placement of titles to identify anything that strikes you as questionable. We are particularly worried about 100 or 200-level courses labeled \"Intro to College Mathematics\" that, when you go to the on-line catalogs, say that the course covers everything from logs to combinatorics to game theory. What's going on here? What guidances can you offer us? 2. It is proposed to take Differential Equations out of the general Calculus code and give it a separate code. It's easy to do that, and important in the analysis of the progress of engineering students. But what about Linear Algebra which, according to some course descriptions, is taught in the same breath with Calculus III or IV?
