[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "This paper evaluates the relative contribution of factor accumulation and technology in explaining output per worker differences across Italian regions in the period 2000-2004. The contributions of physical and human capital are separately estimated through the variance decomposition of output per worker. Whereas from a basic analysis of development accounting with crude data TFP emerges as a fundamental determinant of output per worker, when more accurate data are used in the estimations of human and physical capital, results change radically, showing a higher importance of factor accumulation with respect to previous standard estimations. Several measures of quality of human and physical capital are introduced: a) individuals' cognitive skills as measured in international test scores; b) region specific rates of return on human capital; c) public investments and public-subsidized investments are weighted differently from private investment in the determination of physical capital stock.

There is no general consensus about whether rich countries are so because they employ a greater amount of physical and human capital or because they use better technologies and employ factors of production more efficiently 1 . This question is sometime refered to as the \"A vs. K\" 2 or \"idea gaps vs. object gaps\" debate (Romer, 1993) .\nWhereas Mankiw, Romer and Weil (1992) , Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1995) and Young (1995) argue that something like 80 percent of differences in development are explained by factor accumulation (their findings have been dubbed \"a neoclassical revival\"), Hall and Jones (1999) , Klenow and Rodriguez-Clare (1997) , Caselli (2005) , Gundlach, Rudman and Woessmann (2002) , Easterly and Levine (2001) , among many others, have found instead that * I would like to thank for helpful comments and suggestions Francesco Aiello, Maria De Paola and seminar participants at the XX AIEL conference (Rome; 22-23 September 2005) . Usual disclaimers apply. 1 More specifically, differences in TFP could be caused by the adoption of different technologies or could be due to the existence of production externalities, spillovers, complementarity among production factors, economies of scale etc. 2 Technology or TFP is usually indicated with \"A\" in formal models, while \"K\" represents capital accumulation.\ntechnological differences are the main causes of the uneven levels of development across countries.\nThe issue of the relative role of factor inputs and technology is strictly related to the validity of neoclassical growth theory, which assumes that technology is a public good freely available to all countries and, as a consequence, concludes that cross-country differences in development levels are due to a different degree of factor accumulation.\nFundamental policy implications derive from this debate on the causes of development.\nIn fact, if factors are important, then policies to encourage investments in physical capital or in education should be implemented, whilst if a crucial role is played by technology or efficiency then policy interventions should be aimed at stimulating transfers of knowledge and of technology and the adoption of the most efficient productive, organizational process.\nThe main aim of this paper is to apply the \"development accounting\" 3 methodologyused recently by Caselli (2005) , Klenow and Rodriguez-Clare (1997) and Gundlach, Rudman, Woessmann (2002) in cross-country development analysis -to evaluate to what degrees the wide differences in output per worker existing across Italian regions, for the period 2000-2004, can be attributed to different levels of accumulation of physical and human capital or to different levels of efficiency (Total Factor Productivity or TFP).\nWhile recently some works have estimated regional TFP levels and have pointed out its wide variability and the correlation between TFP and labour productivity (Aiello and Scoppa, 2000; Marrocu, Paci and Pala, 2000; Di Liberto, Mura and Pigliaru, 2004) , the decomposition of differences in output per worker into the contributions made by physical capital, human capital and Total Factor Productivity is new for Italian regions.\nThe method of variance decomposition of output is used to measure the contribution of factors of production and, as a residual, the contribution of technology. The methodology is based on calibration which, differently from an econometric analysis, allows the evaluation of the impact of different values of parameters, various functional forms and a variety of procedures for measuring output and inputs. In fact, since development accounting exercises tend to be very sensitive to assumptions about functional forms and parameters, we aim to evaluate how the findings obtained are influenced by the way factors are measured or by the functions and parameters used.\nParticular attention is devoted to the measurement of the quality of factors of production. Firstly, human capital is measured not only on the basis of the average years of schooling of the labour force, as is standard in literature, but also by taking into account the effective cognitive skills acquired by students at school, as measured in international test scores.\nSecondly, region specific rates of return on human capital are used instead of a common national rate. With regards to physical capital, public and public-subsidized investments are disaggregated from the stock of physical capital and given a different weight (under the assumption that their relative productivities might be lower than pure private investments).\nTo a first approximation, we confirm the importance of differences in TFP (with a weight of about 80%), finding that it is robust to changes in standard parameters. However, we show that when human and physical capital are measured in a more accurate and comprehensive way, the proportion explained by these factors is much higher and TFP role is considerably reduced (by up to around 30%). Physical and human capital appear more heterogeneous across regions and much more related to productivity. In practice, it emerges that mismeasurement of factors emphasised the weight attributed to TFP. The solowian \"measure of our ignorance\" is considerably attenuated through an improvement in the measurement of the quality of inputs.\nIn the concluding remarks we speculate that if better measures of factors become available at international level too, the estimated preponderance of TFP could be reduced and differences would be ascribed directly to the accumulation of input factors.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we present the method of variance decomposition and the assumptions about the production function. section 3 describes the data and the building of variables used in the analysis and shows the baseline results and some robustness checks. section 4 and 5 evaluate the impact of the introduction of more far-reaching changes in the measurement of human and physical capital. Concluding remarks are presented in section 6."}, {"section_title": "The variance decomposition of output", "text": "The aggregate production function used in the analysis to describe the production process in each region is a standard Cobb-Douglas function with constant returns to scale:\nwhere Y is the aggregate level of output, K is the stock of physical capital, h denotes the human capital per worker, L is the number of workers, A is a measure of technological efficiency or Total Factor Productivity (TFP) and \u03b1 is the output elasticity of capital, equal to the capital share of income under the assumption that factors are paid their social marginal product.\nIn our basic framework we assume Hicks-neutral productivity (instead of Harrod-neutral or labour-augmenting productivity) and hence, output per worker is written as a function of the capital-labour ratio ( ) L K (as in Caselli, 2005) . 4 Dividing the production function [1] by L:\n, the production function can be written simply as:\n.

As is evident from definitions, the terms k c and h c in the above decomposition are equal to the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) coefficients of the following two regressions:\nAs shown by Caselli (2005) and Gundlach, Rudman and Woessmann (2002) , the substantial difference between the two approaches is that, with the assumption of Harrod-neutrality, more weight is given to technology, since any technological shock which also causes a variation of capital is attributed to productivity instead of capital (since Y K tends to remain constant).\nIn this formulation, k c ( h c ) shows how much higher physical (human) capital is in a region in which one observes a 1% higher output per worker."}, {"section_title": "The alternative index used by Caselli (2005)", "text": "It is useful to compare Klenow-Rodriguez-Clare's (KRC) approach with the slightly different strategy adopted by Caselli (2005) .

All the assumptions on parameter values will be subject to scrutiny in the next section.\nIt is interesting to look first at the variances and covariances of variables. From Table 2 , it emerges that the variances of k and h are much smaller than the variance of y, that is, factor inputs tend to be distributed across regions much more homogenously than output. The correlation of y with k is also quite low (0.10) while the correlation between y and h (0.49) is more accentuated. From our first baseline estimates in Table 3 , the results are noteworthy: factor inputs explain only a marginal share of the differences in output per worker. In particular, physical capital per worker appears to have almost no influence (4.9%), while a limited influence is exercised by human capital (15.9%). Since differences in physical and human capital across regions appear quite limited, they could not explain much about the disparities in development.\nRegional Total Factor Productivity is the preponderant determinant of output per worker (79.3%) A comparison with the variable \"success\" used by Caselli (2005) to evaluate the \"factor-only\" model (which compares the counterfactual dispersion of output if all regions had the same level of TFP with the observed dispersion) shows that the joint contribution of human and physical capital is equal to a modest 17.8%, again leaving more than 80% to technological differences. Moreover, the third measure we use, the ratio of the most productive to the least productive regions, confirms almost exactly the finding of a very large contribution of TFP (80.9%).\nComparing the results for Italian regions with cross-country analysis and the international debate, these data seem completely in contrast with the so-called \"neoclassical revival\". For example, Mankiw, Romer and Weil (1992) However, the very low correlation between physical capital and output per worker is rather worrying and represents a first warning that these variables may be badly measured and might not taking effective differences existing across regions fully into account. We verify now whether the implausible results, particularly those regarding the role of physical capital, depend on the assumptions made, and on the particular values imputed, in the determination of this variable with regards to 1) the capital income share \u03b1 ; 2) the depreciation rate \u03b4; or 3) the initial capital stock 0 K . It will be shown that estimates of the contribution of physical capital do not change substantially when these key parameters are changed.\nThe contribution of physical capital is increased as \u03b1 assumes higher values, but quantitatively remains rather low even when considering implausible high values of \u03b1 (for example, when \u03b1 is 0.50 the contribution of capital is only 8.3%). For more realistic valuesestimates by Gollin (2002) and Bernanke and Gurkaynak (2001) show that the capital share for Italy 7 ranges between 0.29 to 0.35 -physical capital contribution remains between 5% and 6%. 7 The figures change according to the methods used to attribute to labour some share of self-employed income.\nSimilarly, when depreciation rate is changed, for example up to the very high value of 15%, the contribution of physical capital is around 13%. Therefore, if we exclude unrealistic high depreciation rates, we can conclude that the contribution of physical capital remains rather limited in explaining regional development differences.\nMoreover, nothing relevant is changed when the initial capital stock is calculated differently. Instead of inserting 0 K as calculated by Paci and Pusceddu (1999) , it can be determined following the standard approach in growth accounting, assuming that it is equal to its steady-state level, that is:\n, where I is the geometric average of the flow of investment (years 1980-82) , n is the regional growth rate of employment, g is the rate of productivity growth and \u03b4 is the depreciation rate. These variables are taken as averages over the period 1980-2004 in order to determine capital stocks in recent years through the perpetual inventory method. Again, the results are not very different from our baseline estimations, since the contribution of physical capital is now around 3%. In section 5 we will deal with more radical changes in the way physical capital is measured."}, {"section_title": "Robustness checks on human capital determination", "text": "In this section we verify how robust previous results are with regards to human capital, that is, we check how the results on the relative contribution of factors and technology change when human capital is measured using reasonable alternative values. 8 The modifications aim to evaluate how results change using an alternative measure of average years of education and taking into account different rates of return on schooling."}, {"section_title": "Years of education among the labour force", "text": "Regional average years of schooling can be calculated on the basis of labour force, drawn from \"ISTAT Labor Force Survey\", 9 (average 2000-2004) instead of employed workers from the Survey of Bank of Italy. Data are shown in Table 4 . 10 These data are for some regions different from the average years of education calculated on the basis of SHIW data set, but the rate of correlation of the two series is 0.69. Using this new variable to calculate regional years of education, Table 5 shows that the relative contribution of human capital is less relevant (only 6.4%) than previously estimated.\nSince we aim to explain output per worker it is perhaps more appropriate to use a measure of workers' education rather than a measure of labour force education. However, for completeness, in section 4, we take into account both these series and compare their respective results."}, {"section_title": "Considering alternative rates of return on human capital", "text": "In section 3, we have assumed that the rate of return on schooling is equal to 5.7%:\n. This is an estimate of the private rate of return, while we should ideally take into account the social rate of return, which is hard to determine. The social return might be higher if externalities tend to prevail, but could be even lower if the signalling function of education prevails (see, among others, Acemoglu and Angrist, 2000, and Pritchett, 2004) .\nIn this sub-section we determine what happens to our estimates when considering alternative rates of return (we let \u03c6 range from 1 to 20%). As expected, since more developed regions have a greater level of education, the role of human capital is enhanced if the rate of return is increased (Table 6 ). However, for rates of return not far from plausible ones -note that from estimates of Psacharopulos (1994) the world average is 10.1 percent, and the OECD average is 6.8 percent -the role of human capital in explaining Italian regional differences is around 20-25%."}, {"section_title": "Decreasing marginal return on schooling", "text": "Instead of a constant rate of return on schooling, one could consider, on the basis of evidence from many labour economics studies, a decreasing marginal return. With this aim, Bils and Klenow (2000) propose the function Using this formulation (see Table 7 ), human capital is less important in explaining development (11.1%). 11 In fact, since human capital is relatively more abundant in rich regions, by considering decreasing marginal returns the role of human capital is attenuated. However, the data and analysis in section 4 will show that it is more likely that marginal returns increase with the level of human capital. Some possible explanations for this pattern is proposed in section 4.\nSumming up this section, we can point out that the standard robustness checks carried out show that estimates of the high relative contribution of TFP, and a limited role for factor accumulation, are substantially confirmed assuming different values for a number of parameters and different functional forms."}, {"section_title": "Improvements in human capital measurement", "text": "In this section, some more radical attempts at improving the measurement of human capital are undertaken. The main aim is to consider not just quantity of human capital, but also its quality.\nTraditional growth studies at cross-country level have commonly taken into account a quantitative measure of schooling, that is, the average years of education in the population or school attainments, ignoring the effective productivity of education or its quality.\nHowever, it is reasonable to assume that one year of schooling does not increase productivity regardless of its quality or regardless of the knowledge acquired by individuals in different educational systems, which strongly differ in their effectiveness. In order to take into account quality, we consider three different measures that have been proposed in growth literature (see Woessmann, 2003; Lee and Barro, 2001) :\n1) direct measures of cognitive abilities of students in Mathematics, Sciences and Reading 11 Hall and Jones (1999) use a piece-wise linear function with decreasing marginal return on schooling. However, given the relative homogeneity of educational levels across regions, using this function would imply the same rate of return for all the regions."}, {"section_title": "Comprehension as measured by international test scores;", "text": "2) country-specific rates of return on education, assuming that in the labour market different rates of return reflect differences in the quality of education acquired by students;\n3) educational inputs, such as the amount of spending on schooling, the students-teacher ratio, school size, the quality of teacher (measured by their educational level, experience or wage level), the amount of resources devoted to books, computers and other teaching facilities, etc.\nWe attempt to take into account the first and second method respectively in sections 5.1 and 5.2. With regards to the third approach, a number of empirical analyses (especially from the US, but also from other countries) show that resources or inputs employed do not significantly affect students' performance. Hanushek (1996) -after reviewing almost 100 empirical works which estimate production functions for education -concludes that the amount of resources dedicated to schooling has little, if any, influence on the knowledge learned by students. The likely explanation to this puzzle is that resources are often not used effectively by schools, because of agency problems and informational asymmetries among agents. Secondly, for our specific purpose, the highly centralized educational system in Italy does not allow for relevant differences in inputs employed in education."}, {"section_title": "School quality and cognitive skills measured in test scores", "text": "As pointed out in cross-country analysis, the most promising way forward in considering quality of human capital appears to be the direct measurement of the skills acquired by students (see Hanushek and Kimko, 2002) .\nIn fact, one year of education in different regions cannot be considered equally productive regardless of the knowledge acquired by students. 12 Regional human capital is accumulated at different rates according to cognitive abilities effectively acquired by students.\nThis acquisition depends on a number of factors: the quality and motivation of teachers, students' (and parents') effort, type of examination, etc. One way to gauge differences in the students' knowledge is to consider the students' performance in test scores.\nSeveral international organizations conduct, in many countries, standardized tests periodically in order to assess the knowledge acquired by students in Mathematics, Science and Reading Comprehension. The International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA) in the programme \"Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study\"\n(TIMSS) and the OECD in the \"Programme for International Student Assessment\" (PISA) provide data on students' cognitive skills in many countries. Moreover, OECD measures the literacy among the adult population in the \"International Adult Literacy Survey\" (IALS in the mid-90s). 13 These tests show that large differences exist between countries in the skills acquired by individuals.\nAt an international level, when human capital is measured taking into account these qualitative differences, the role of human capital appears to be very large, according to different formulations. Through this method, combining in a single measure of quality the results of 26 international test scores, Hanushek and Kimko (2000) found that quality of schooling is highly significant in growth regressions (even when quantity of schooling loses significance) while Gundlach, Rudman and Woessmann (2002) and Woessman (2003) have evaluated the role of human capital corrected for quality in the range of 45 to 61%.\nThe above mentioned international test scores contain results at macro-region level with regards to Italy. 14 Lacking reliable single regional data for each region, to each region is imputed the value corresponding to the macro-region it belongs to. We have test scores on the following five recent surveys: PISA (years 2000 and 2003) , TIMSS (1999 and 2003) and IALS (1998) . Each test is re-parameterised on a scale 0-100 and combined together (through geometric average) into a single measure of quality, denoted with q.\nThe test scores show the existence of huge differences between Italian regions (Table   8) Following standard assumptions made in the literature (see, for example, Hanushek and Kimko, 2002) we suppose that educational institutions and quality of education change only 13 The OECD is currently carrying out the Adult Literacy and Life Skills Survey (ALL). 14 Unfortunately, the Italian surveys usually contain results only for five macro-areas: Northwest, Northeast, Centre, South and Islands (Sardinia and Sicily). In some surveys, data for particular regions are available (which we use in our computations). slowly with time and therefore the performance of present students also reflects the knowledge possessed by previous generations of students, that is, the present stock of workers. This is also confirmed by the strong correlation existing between students' achievement in tests and the results which emerged from the test on literacy conducted in the Italian adult population (the OECD-IALS).\nIn order to take into account quality of human capital, following Caselli (2005) , the equation of determination of human capital is assumed to be the following:\nrepresents the efficiency (or quality) of human capital, which is variable across regions. The parameter \u03c0 represents the rate of return on quality of schooling and it is drawn from some micro-econometric studies which estimate the impact of test scores on individual wages, in addition to the influence of completed years of education (Murnane, Willett and Levy, 1995; Currie and Thomas, 1999; Hanushek and Kimko, 2002) . As reported by Caselli (2005) , according to these studies \u03c0 can vary from 0.08% (0.0008) and 1.02% (0.012).\nThis implies that, considering for example % 5 . 0 = \u03c0 , an increase of 10 points in the skills quality q (i.e., changing from the Sicilian performance (the lowest) to the Umbrian performance (around the Italian average)) leads to an increase of 5% in wages (and hence of worker productivity under our assumptions). Table 9 clearly shows the importance of human capital when its quality is properly taken into account. While when capital is measured simply considering years of education, it explains a mere 15% in Italian regional development differentials, introducing a correction in its measurement to consider the effective quality of labour force skills greatly increases its weight as a factor of development. Human capital can explain almost half of the difference in the levels of development, becoming the most important production factor, even considering very low rates of return on quality. If we consider % 5 . 0 = \u03c0 (about the average among the different available estimates) as a benchmark, human capital explains about 40% of differences in development.\nIf we use the average years of education among the labour force (see section 3.2), we have similar results, even though the contribution of human capital is attenuated: from Table 10, with % 5 . 0 = \u03c0 human capital is able to explain about 30%. We follow their approach in order to check the robustness of previous estimates. 16 We divide the test scores of each macro-region by the Italian average, then we average through different available measures. The results are reported in Table 11 . Table 11 substantially confirms the results obtained following Caselli's approach, that is, when human capital is adjusted to include quality, it appears as the main determinant (48%) in explaining differences in development among Italian regions.\nWhile regional differences in quantity of schooling are not very relevant, considering quality too, it emerges that about half of the disparities in development among Italian regions can be attributed to the different skills of the labour forces."}, {"section_title": "Region-specific rates of return on education", "text": "The second method to take into account qualitative differences in human capital is based on the 16 In this approach, the marginal return to q is s \u03c6 . Since the average s is 10.9 and ( )q Table 9. econometric estimation of a rate of return on schooling for each single region. 17 In theory, a better quality of education should make workers more productive and in competitive labour markets this should lead to a higher return on schooling. Therefore, instead of using direct measurements of acquired skills, it is appropriate to consider regional specific rates of return on schooling ( ) i \u03c6 , to take into account different levels of quality across regions.\nIn order to estimate human capital, we amend the human capital function of section 3 to take into account the fact that regions can differ in their rates of return on education, in the following way:\n, where i \u03c6 represents the specific rate of return on schooling for region i.\nWith this aim, we use the regional rates of returns on education calculated by Ciccone (2004), using the Bank of Italy's Survey (SHIW) aggregating a series of waves (since 1987 to 2000, totalling over 45000 individual observations). 18 The author estimates a different mincerian wage equation for each region and adjusts the returns for gross wages. 19 The results are reported in Table 12 . The data in Table 12 show a clear pattern in which richer regions have higher returns on human capital (that is, Nothern regions have rates of return significantly higher than Southern regions). This non standard result could be determined because of differences in educational quality or in labour market conditions. A first direct explanation is that these rates of returns capture differences in the quality of human capital (see Woessman, 2003; Gundlach, Rudman and Woessmann, 2002) . Skills in developed regions may be paid for more simply because they incorporate higher quality. This is strongly confirmed by the data of school quality considered in the previous section (the 17 At an international level, this method is affected by measurement errors. Many countries do not have reliable data to measure rates of return on education as is confirmed by huge differences in countryspecific rates of return (see Psacharopoulos, 1994 , for a review). 18 See also the related work of Ciccone, Cingano and Cipollone (2005) . 19 In the last part of this paper, the author estimates the private return on schooling as equal to the discount rate that equalizes the present value of the private costs and benefits generated by an increase in educational attainment. In our analysis this rate is less appropriate since it includes, among individual benefits, the probability of finding employment, which is not related to the output per worker which we are interested to explain. correlation between the regional rates of returns and the school quality index is 0.66).\nAn alternative explanation may be offered in a standard supply and demand framework, such as the one used by Katz and Murphy (1992) and by Juhn, Murphy and Pierce (1993) to explain the increasing wage inequality among skilled and unskilled workers (for a review see Katz and Autor, 1999) . One could represent developed regions as characterized by a relatively higher demand for skills with respect to poorer regions (for example because of complementarity existing between skills and the type of capital employed or the sectorial specialisation), leading to a demand curve shifted to the right. With an increasing supply curve with no substantial differences across regions, this would lead to both a higher proportion of skilled workers in richer regions labour markets, and, at the same time, to a higher relative compensation for skills.\nUsing the rates of return of Table 12 , we obtain the results shown in Table 13 (first two columns). Since estimations of regional rates of return might not be robust, due to a small number of observations in each region, in the last two columns only the returns estimated for macro-regions, which appear more robust, are taken into account,. According to Ciccone, Cingano, Cipollone (2005) , differences across macro-regions are significant at 1% level. Table 13 .

As sustained forcefully by Pritchett (2000) and other growth economists, it is not reasonable to suppose that all the expenditure in investment is transformed directly into productive capital, especially for the public sector. 21 Pritchett (2000) argues that agency problems plaguing government are more pervasive than in the private sector since public sector firms or organizations often operate in monopolistic markets, there is no market for the ownership of assets and many goods provided by government are public goods. These problems give rise to distorted behaviour by public actors, such as corruption, \"patronage\" (transfers to political supporters) or simply shirking (low effort to reduce costs), which create a wedge between the actual cost of investment and its minimum economic cost. The ratio between the minimum economic cost and the actual cost of investment is defined by Pritchett as the \"efficacy of investment\" and, in general, it is less than one, notwithstanding the fact that in empirical growth analysis researchers almost invariably assume a perfect efficacy. Moreover, public investment may be made in important but less dynamic sectors or led by welfare considerations rather than simply by productive efficiency.\nGolden and Picci (2005) carry out a painstaking analysis of the Italian regional endowment of infrastructures, comparing an index calculated on the basis of effectively existing physical infrastructures with an index of public expenditure on infrastructures (the amount of money spent over the years by government with this aim). They demonstrate the existence of wide differences among these two indexes: several regions (especially Southern ones) show a level of infrastructures which is much lower than their expenditure on public works (\"missing infrastructure\"). According to the authors, these differences can be attributed mainly to the existence of embezzlement, fraud and widespread corruption among politicians and public actors and also to waste and bad management. Golden and Picci (2005) On the basis of these analyses we proceed by disaggregating public investment and public-subsidised investment from private investment, since they cannot be realistically considered equally productive 22 . More precisely, we suppose that all the expenditure made do not transform in productive capital due to bad decisions, corruption and other agency costs and to aims pursued by the public sector which are based on welfare and equity considerations and not only on productive efficiency. In the calculation of the regional stock of capital we give a different weight to these two categories of investments.\nWe use \"Public Sector Accounts at regional level\" (from 1996 to 2003) , provided by the Italian Ministry of Economics and Finance, 23 in order to determine the share on total investment of public investment (expenditure for constructions, machinery and equipment) 24 and the share of public subsidized investment (subsidies to firms for investments) 25 . Results are reported in Table 14 . We firstly deal only with public investments. 26 The regional stock of capital is calculated 22 Jorgenson and Griliches (1967) have shown the importance in growth accounting analysis of disaggregating the inputs by quality classes. 23 Source: \"Conti pubblici territoriali del Dipartimento per le Politiche di Sviluppo e Coesione\" 24 The sum of the categories \"Beni e opere immobiliari\" and \"Beni mobili, macchinari\". 25 The category \"Trasferimenti in conto capitale a imprese private\". 26 In this analysis we exclude Valle d'Aosta because it clearly represents an outlier. Probably this is due to its geomorphology: Valle d'Aosta is an extremely mountainous region, which makes public works extremely expensive, in particular in comparison to the small size of its economy.\ngiving to public investment in each region a weight equal to the \"measure of effectiveness\" built by Golden and Picci (2005) . This should give a stock of public capital in line with the existing stock of physical infrastructures. We now consider investments subsidized by the State. These subsidies to firms could distort investment choice: firms may over-invest (considering that their capital cost is reduced) or invest in less efficient projects or sectors (public contributions are often conditional on investing in particular sectors or on using determined technologies), or the funds could be embezzled by entrepreneurs or simply wasted (on this topic see the recent books by Giavazzi, 2005, and Rossi, 2005) 28 . Moreover, the State often uses public subsidies as a welfare policy and to help declining sectors, leading to lower productivity for these investments.\nConsidering these possible inefficiencies, which might reduce the efficacy of subsidized investments in forming productive capital, we give different weights to the amount of investment financed through public funds. However, differently from the above analysis of public investments, we suppose that this weight is uniform across regions, since we do not have any reliable measure to differentiate regions in this respect (Table 16 ). Scalera and Zazzaro (2000) for an analysis of many distortions that can be related to public aids to firms, and Roberto Perotti (\"Patti territoriali, Un freno per il Sud\", Il Sole 24 Ore, 2-12-2000; \"E' meglio che lo Stato non investa\", La Repubblica, 5-7-1999). Table 16 shows that, by weighting differently subsidized investments, physical capital becomes much more significant in explaining regional development differentials. Supposing that subsidized investment is only 50% productive with respect to fully private investment, we are able to explain about 30% of productivity differences thanks to variations in the stock of physical capital. As a consequence, considering also that human capital can explain almost 40%, the role of TFP is substantially reduced to 30% (from 80% in the benchmark case)."}, {"section_title": "Concluding remarks", "text": "Using the variance decomposition methodology we have determined the role of accumulation of physical and human capital and the role of technology in explaining the uneven development across Italian regions for the period 2000-2004. By measuring production factors in the standard quantitative way, we attribute most of the differences (about 80%) in output per worker to TFP differences, whereas the weights of human and physical capital are respectively 16% and 4%.\nThe identifying of TFP as the main determinant of development experiences is robust to traditional accounting exercises of the type usually conducted in cross-country analysis (Caselli, 2005; Klenow and Rodriguez-Clare, 1997) , consisting of the evaluation of the influence of different values of crucial parameters such as capital-output elasticity, the depreciation rate, the initial capital stock and the rate of return on schooling. In other words, the critique raised by Mankiw (1997) of excess sensitivity to parameter values does not appear compelling in our setting.\nHowever, the estimates of the role of technology and factor accumulation are not robust to some new exercises allowed by a greater availability of data derived from a comparison of regions within the same country.\nInstead of measuring human capital simply with the average years of education among labour force, following Hanushek and Kimko (2002) we take into account the effective skills acquired by students or by the adult population using the results of international test scores on cognitive abilities. This new measurement produces a noteworthy increase in the role of human capital of up to 40-50%, using reasonable parameterisation. Similar figures can be obtained through an alternative mode of measurement, that is, when human capital stock is computed using region-specific rates of return on schooling, which are used to capture different levels of human capital quality.\nFinally, physical capital is re-estimated by disaggregating public from private investments in order to take account -following the analysis of Pritchett (2000) and Golden and Picci (2005) -of different productivities of these two categories of investments, due to welfare considerations which could drive public intervention or to moral hazard problems, corruption, and so on, that are much more likely in the public sector. Using this new evaluation, results change again drastically, since the role of physical capital is increased up to about 30%.\nOverall, the re-evaluation of human and physical capital to take quality into account lead us to think that the accumulation of factors is an important source of development and that it can explain much more than previously estimated. On the other hand, the role of TFP is much smaller (about 30% instead of 80%).\nTFP is somehow a black box (Solow defined it as \"a measure of our ignorance\") and analysis adopting crude estimations of factors place inside TFP the mismeasurement of the quality of human and physical capital. In practice, in the baseline case, we have attributed to the residual TFP, differences in the quality of human capital (workers possess heterogeneous skills which are not captured by differences in the years of education) and in the quality of physical capital (a part of physical capital as measured by money spent does not exist, in reality, because of moral hazard problems, or it is simply less productive). Human and physical capital are not so similar across regions as it could appear from a superficial analysis: from a comprehensive evaluation, both human and physical capital turn out to be less homogenous and highly correlated with regional productivity.\nOur analysis can also shed light on the interpretation of cross-country development accounting analysis. A number of studies argues that technological gaps have a dominant role in explaining output per worker levels across countries. However, due particularly to poor availability of data, production factors are often estimated in a cruder way at cross-country level. It is likely that if human capital and physical capital are better measured, as we have done in this paper thanks to more accurate regional data, then physical and human capital can emerge as fundamental factors of development and reduce the measure of our ignorance."}]
