[{"section_title": "", "text": ". On January 7, a novel coronavirus, originally abbreviated as 2019-nCoV by WHO, was identified from the throat swab sample of a patient [2] . This pathogen was later renamed as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the Coronavirus Study Group [3] and the disease was named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) by the WHO. As of January 30, 7,736 confirmed and 12,167 suspected cases had been reported in China and 82 confirmed cases had been detected in 18 other countries [4] . In the same day, WHO declared the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) [4] .\nAccording to the National Health Commission of China, the mortality rate among confirmed cased in China was 2.1% as of February 4 [5] and the mortality rate was 0.2% among cases outside China [6] . Among patients admitted to hospitals, the mortality rate ranged between 11% and 15% [7, 8] . COVID-19 is moderately infectious with a relatively high mortality rate, but the information available in public reports and published literature is rapidly increasing. The aim of this review is to summarize the current understanding of COVID-19 including causative agent, pathogenesis of the disease, diagnosis and treatment of the cases, as well as control and prevention strategies."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The virus: classification and origin SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the family Coronaviridae and order Nidovirales. Deltacoronavirus includes viruses isolated from pigs and birds [9] . SARS-CoV-2 belongs to Betacoronavirus together with two highly pathogenic viruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped and positivesense single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) virus [16] .\nSARS-CoV-2 is considered a novel human-infecting Betacoronavirus [10] .\nPhylogenetic analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 genome indicates that the virus is closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived SARS-like coronaviruses collected in 2018 in eastern China (bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21) and genetically distinct from SARS-CoV (with about 79% similarity) and MERS-CoV [10] . Using the genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2, RaTG13, and SARS-CoV [11] , a further study found that the virus is more related to BatCoV RaTG13, a bat coronavirus that was previously detected in Rhinolophus affinis from Yunnan Province, with 96.2% overall genome sequence identity [11] . A study found that no evidence of recombination events detected in the genome of SARS-CoV-2 from other viruses originating from bats such as BatCoV RaTG13, SARS-CoV and SARSr-CoVs [11] .\nAltogether, these findings suggest that bats might be the original host of this virus [10, 11] . For example, Nipah virus in Bangladesh is transmitted through bats shedding into raw date palm sap [12] ."}, {"section_title": "Transmission", "text": "The role of the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in propagating disease is unclear. Many initial COVID-19 cases were linked to this market suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 was transmitted from animals to humans [13] . However, a genomic study has provided evidence that the virus was introduced from\nanother, yet unknown location, into the market where it spread more rapidly, although human-to-human transmission may have occurred earlier [14] .\nClusters of infected family members and medical workers have confirmed the presence of person-to-person transmission [15] . After January 1, less than 10% of patients had market exposure and more than 70% patients had no exposure to the market [13] . Person-to-person transmission is thought to occur among close contacts mainly via respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Fomites may be a large source of transmission, as SARS-CoV has been found to persist on surfaces up to 96\nhours [16] and other coronaviruses for up to 9 days [17] .\nWhether or not there is asymptomatic transmission of disease is controversial. One initial study published on January 30 reported asymptomatic transmission [18] , but later it was found that the researchers had not directly interviewed the patient, who did in fact have symptoms prior to transmitting disease [19] . A more recent study published on February 21\nalso purported asymptomatic transmission [20] , but any such study could be limited by errors in self-reported symptoms or contact with other cases and fomites. [26] . One study estimated that that basic reproductive number (R0) was 2.2 (95% CI: 1.4 to 3.9) [13] . However, later in a further analysis of 12 available studies found that R0 was 3.28 [27] . Because R0 represents an average value it is also important to consider the role of super spreaders, who may be hugely responsible for outbreaks within large clusters but who would not largely influence the value of R0 [28] . During the acute phase of an outbreak or prepandemic, R0 may be unstable [24] .\nIn pregnancy, a study of nine pregnancy women who developed COVID-19 in late pregnancy suggested COVID-19 did not lead to substantially worse symptoms than in nonpregnant persons and there is no evidence for intrauterine infection caused by vertical transmission [29] .\nIn hospital setting, a study involving 138 COVID-19 suggested that hospitalassociated transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurred in 41% of patients [30] .\nMoreover, another study on 425 patients found that the proportion of cases in health care workers gradually increased by time [13] . These cases likely reflect exposure to a higher concentration of virus from sustained contact in close quarters. "}, {"section_title": "Risk factors", "text": "The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection is seen most often in adult male patients with the median age of the patients was between 34 and 59 years [20, 30, 32, 33] . SARS-CoV-2 is also more likely to infect people with chronic comorbidities such as cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases and diabetes [8] . The highest proportion of severe cases occur in adults \u226560 years of age, and in those with certain underlying conditions, such as cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases and diabetes [20, 30] . Severe manifestations maybe also associated with coinfections of bacteria and fungi [8] .\nFewer COVID-19 cases have been reported in children less than 15 years [20, 30, 32, 33] . In a study of 425 COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, published on January 29, there were no cases in children under 15 years of age [34] .\nNevertheless, 28 paediatric patients have been reported by January 2020 [35] . The clinical features of infected paediatric patients vary, but most have had mild symptoms with no fever or pneumonia, and have a good prognosis [35] . Another study found that although a child had radiological ground-glass lung opacities, the patient was asymptomatic [36] . In summary, children might be less likely to be infected or, if infected, present milder manifestations than adults; therefore, it is possible that their parents will not seek out treatment leading to underestimates of COVID-19 incidence in this age group."}, {"section_title": "Pathogenesis and immune response", "text": "Like most other members of the coronavirus family, Betacoronavirus exhibit high species specificity, but subtle genetic changes can significantly alter their tissue tropism, host range, and pathogenicity. A striking example of the adaptability of these viruses is the emergence of deadly zoonotic diseases in human history caused by SARS-CoV [37] and MERS-CoV [38] . In both viruses, bats served as the natural reservoir and humans were the terminal host, with the palm civet and dromedary camel the intermediary host for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively [39, 40] . Intermediate hosts clearly play a critical role in cross species transmission as they can facilitate increased contact between a virus and a new host and enable further adaptation necessary for an effective replication in the new host [41] . Because of the pandemic potential of SARS-CoV-2, careful surveillance is immensely important to monitor its future host adaptation, viral evolution, infectivity, transmissibility, and pathogenicity.\nThe host range of a virus is governed by multiple molecular interactions, including receptor interaction. The envelope spike (S) protein receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 was shown structurally similar to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues [10] . Further extensive structural analysis strongly suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may use host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to enter the cells [42] , the same receptor facilitating SARS-CoV to infect the airway epithelium and alveolar type 2 (AT2) pneumocytes, pulmonary cells that synthesize pulmonary surfactant [43] . In general, the spike protein of coronavirus is divided into the S1 and S2 domain, in which S1 is responsible for receptor binding and S2 domain is responsible for cell membrane fusion [10] . The S1\ndomain of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 share around 50 conserved amino acids, whereas most of the bat-derived viruses showed more variation [10] .\nIn addition, identification of several key residues (Gln493 and Asn501) that govern the binding of SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain with ACE2 further support that SARS-CoV-2 has acquired capacity for person-to-person transmission [42] . Although, the spike protein sequence of receptor binding SARS-CoV-2 is more similar to that of SARS-CoV, at the whole genome level SARS-CoV-2 is more closely related to bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 Studies have shown patients suffering from severe pneumonia, with fever and dry cough as common symptoms at onset of illness [7, 8] . Some patients progressed rapidly with Acute Respiratory Stress Syndrome (ARDS) and septic shock, which was eventually followed by multiple organ failure and about 10% of patients have died [8] . IL7, TNF-\u237a, GSCF, MCP1 than healthy adults [7] . Importantly, patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) have a significantly higher level of GSCF, IP10, MCP1, and TNF-\u237a than those non-ICU patients, suggesting that a cytokine storm might be an underlying cause of disease severity [7] . Unexpectedly, anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL10 and IL4 were also increased in those patients [7] , which was uncommon phenomenon for an acute phase viral infection. Another interesting finding, as explained before, was that SARS-CoV-2 has shown to preferentially infect older adult males with rare cases reported in children [7, 8] . The same trend was observed in primate models of SARS-CoV where the virus was found more likely to infect aged Cynomolgus macaque than young adults [47] . Further studies are necessary to identify the virulence factors and the host genes of SARS-CoV-2 that allows the virus to cross the species-specific barrier and cause lethal disease in humans."}, {"section_title": "Clinical manifestations of 2019-nCoV infection have similarities with SARS-", "text": "CoV where the most common symptoms include fever, dry cough, dyspnoea, chest pain, fatigue and myalgia [7, 30, 48] .

The median duration from first symptoms to ARDS was 8 days [30] . For patients who meet diagnostic criteria for SARS-CoV-2 testing, the CDC recommends collection of specimens from the upper respiratory tract (nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab) and, if possible, the lower respiratory tract (sputum, tracheal aspirate, or bronchoalveolar lavage) [52] ."}, {"section_title": "Diagnosis", "text": "In each country, the tests are performed by laboratories designated by the government."}, {"section_title": "Laboratory findings", "text": "Among COVID-19 patients, common laboratory abnormalities include lymphopenia [8, 20, 30] , prolonged prothrombin time, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase [30] .

Some patients had elevated aspartate aminotransferase, creatine kinase, creatinine, and Creactive protein [20, 32, 36] .

Abnormalities on chest CT-scan were also seen in another study of 6 cases, in which all of them showed multifocal patchy ground-glass opacities notably nearby the peripheral sections of the lungs [36] . Data from studies indicate that the typical of chest CT-scan findings are bilateral pulmonary parenchymal ground-glass and consolidative pulmonary opacities [7, 8, 20, 30, 32, 33, 54] . The consolidated lung lesions among patients five or more days from disease onset and those 50 years old or older compared to 4 or fewer days and those 50 years or younger, respectively [48] .\nAs the disease course continue, mild to moderate progression of disease were noted in some cases which manifested by extension and increasing density of lung opacities [50] . Bilateral multiple lobular and subsegmental areas of consolidation are typical findings on chest CT-scan of ICU-admitted patients [7] . A study among 99 patients, one patient had pneumothorax in an imaging examination [8] ."}, {"section_title": "Treatments", "text": "Similar to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, there is still no specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19 [55] . Isolation and supportive care including oxygen therapy, fluid management, and antibiotics treatment for secondary bacterial infections is recommended [56] . Some COVID-19 patients progressed rapidly to ARDS and septic shock, which was eventually followed by multiple organ failure [7, 8] . Therefore, the effort on initial management of COVID-19 must be addressed to the early recognition of the suspect and contain the disease spread by immediate isolation and infection control measures [57] .\nCurrently, no vaccination is available, but even if one was available, uptake might be suboptimal. A study of intention to vaccinate during the H1N1 pandemic in the United States was around 50% at the start of the pandemic in May 2009 but had decreased to 16% by January 2010 [58] .\nNeither is a treatment available. Therefore, the management of the disease has been mostly supportive referring to the disease severity which has been introduced by WHO. If sepsis is identified, empiric antibiotic should be administered based on clinical diagnosis and local epidemiology and susceptibility information. Routine glucocorticoids administration are not recommended to use unless there are another indication [59] . Clinical evidence also does not support corticosteroid treatment [60] . Use of intravenous immunoglobulin might help for severely ill patients [8] .\nDrugs are being evaluated in line with past investigations into therapeutic treatments for SARS and MERS [61] . Overall, there is not robust evidence that these antivirals can significantly improve clinical outcomes A. Antiviral drugs such as oseltamivir combined with empirical antibiotic treatment have also been used to treat COVID-19 patients [7] . Remdesivir which was developed for Ebola virus, has been used to treat imported COVID-19 cases in US [62] . A brief report of treatment combination of Lopinavir/Ritonavir, Arbidol, and Shufeng Jiedu Capsule (SFJDC), a traditional Chinese medicine, showed a clinical benefit to three of four COVID-19 patients [63] . There is an ongoing clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of lopinavir-ritonavir and interferon-\u03b1 2b in patients with COVID-19 [56] . Ramsedivir, a broad spectrum antivirus has demonstrated in vitro and in vivo efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 and has also initiated its clinical trial [64, 65] . In addition, other potential drugs from existing antiviral agent have also been proposed [66, 67] ."}, {"section_title": "Control and prevention strategies", "text": "COVID-19 is clearly a serious disease of international concern. By some estimates it has a higher reproductive number than SARS [27] , and more people have been reported to have been infected or died from it than SARS [68] . Similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, disrupting the chain of transmission is considered key to stopping the spread of disease [69] .\nDifferent strategies should be implemented in health care settings and at the local and global levels.\nHealth care settings can unfortunately be an important source of viral transmission. As shown in the model for SARS, applying triage, following correct infection control measures, isolating the cases and contact tracing are key to limit the further spreading of the virus in clinics and hospitals [69] .\nSuspected cases presenting at healthcare facilities with symptoms of respiratory infections (e.g. runny nose, fever and cough) must wear a face mask to contain the virus and strictly adhere triage procedure. They should not be permitted to wait with other patients seeking medical care at the facilities. They should be placed in a separated, fully ventilated room and approximately 2 meters away from other patients with convenient access to respiratory hygiene supplies [70] . In addition, if a confirmed COVID-19 case require hospitalization, they must be placed in a single patient room with negative air pressure -a minimum of six air changes per hour. Exhausted air has to be filtered through high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) and medical personnel entering the room should wear personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, gown, disposable N95, and eye protection. Once the cases are recovered and discharged, the room should be decontaminated or disinfected and personnel entering the room need to wear PPE particularly facemask, gown, eye protection [70] .\nIn a community setting, isolating infected people are the primary measure to interrupt the transmission. For example, immediate actions taken by Chinese health authorities included isolating the infected people and quarantining of suspected people and their close contacts [71] . Also, as there are still conflicting assumptions regarding the animal origins of the virus (i.e. some studies linked the virus to bat [72, 73] while others associated the virus with snake [74] ), contacts with these animal fluids or tissues or consumption of wild caught animal meet should be avoided. Moreover, educating the public to recognise unusual symptoms such as chronic cough or shortness of breath is essential therefore that they could seek medical care for early detection of the virus. If large-scale community transmission occurs, mitigating social gatherings, temporary school closure, home isolation, close monitoring of symptomatic individual, provision of life supports (e.g. oxygen supply, mechanical ventilator), personal hand hygiene, and wearing personal protective equipment such as facemask should also be enforced [75] .\nIn global setting, locking down Wuhan city was one of the immediate measure taken by Chinese authorities and hence had slowed the global spread of COVID-19 [75] . Air travel should be limited for the cases unless severe medical attentions are required. Setting up temperature check or scanning is mandatory at airport and border to identify the suspected cases.\nContinued research into the virus is critical to trace the source of the outbreak and provide evidence for future outbreak [75] ."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "The current COVID-19 pandemic is clearly an international public health "}]
