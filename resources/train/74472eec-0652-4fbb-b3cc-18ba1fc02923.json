The pathological hallmarks of AD consist of aggregation of \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) peptides into plaques and phosphorylation of tau into neurofibrillary tangles (Shaw et al., 2009) , which are thought to spread in the brain in an orderly fashion (Braak and Braak, 1991) . For instance, neurofibrillary tangles first appear in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus, then spread to neocortical association areas and finally reach the primary cortex. However, recent evidence suggests that many patients with AD do not show this spatial pattern of progression of tangles, indicating that there might be distinct pathological subtypes within AD.\nIn a previous neuropathological study, Murray et al. (2011) found three distinct AD pathological subtypes based on the distribution of tangles in the brain. These subtypes were characterized by either a high number of neurofibrillary tangles in the hippocampus, cortical regions or both and were labeled as limbic-predominant, hippocampal-sparing and typical, respectively. Followed by this description of subtypes, Whitwell et al. (2012) investigated the gray matter differences on structural MRI between these pathological groups and found an association between neurofibrillary tangle deposition and brain atrophy. In addition, the fact that gray matter changes mirrored the regional distribution of tangles suggests that the different pathological subtypes of AD can be investigated in vivo using structural neuroimaging.\nUp to date, two main classes of approaches have been applied to assess the neuroanatomical heterogeneity in AD. The first class consists of identifying different AD subtypes using a supervised approach based on prior clinical, pathological or M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P T E D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 4 neuroimaging criteria, followed by univariate statistical analysis to define distinct anatomical patterns (Whitwell et al., 2012; Byun et al., 2015; Ferreira et al., 2017) .\nThese methods do not allow exploring the variability within the AD population in an unsupervised, unbiased way with respect to its neuroanatomical properties. Moreover, univariate analyses do not consider interactions between variables.\nThe second class of approaches for the identification of AD subtypes includes unsupervised learning methods such as clustering (Noh et al., 1014; Dong et al., 2016; Hwang et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2016; Park et al., 2017) and semi-supervised (Varol et al., 2017) multivariate methods using voxel-based or surface-based morphometry measures. These studies found diverse clusters of atrophy that were partially similar to the ones previously reported in the literature (Murray et al., 2011; Whitwell et al., 2012) . However, in some studies (Noh et al., 1014; Hwang et al., 2016) , the cluster analyses were carried out on a large number of anatomical measures (78,570 cortical thickness vertices) in relatively small groups of AD patients (152 and 77 patients respectively). Carrying out cluster analyses in such high-dimensional datasets of anatomical measures when only small samples of subjects are available can make the distance measures improper to distinguish different groups (Parsons et al., 2004) .\nMoreover, two studies assessed how different subtypes of brain atrophy affected clinical progression in AD (Dong et al., 2016; Na et al., 2016) . The first study used both MCI and AD patients in their clustering analyses, which could have influenced the identification of subtypes since not all MCI patients convert to AD (Dong et al., Hence, to address these limitations, in this study we performed cluster analyses on the gray matter volumes of 162 cortical and subcortical regions of interest (ROI) in 299 AD patients. We applied the Random forest method since it accounts for linear and non-linear interactions between brain regions, which have only been considered in one previous study (Varol et al., 2017) . Moreover, in our analyses we did not make any prior assumptions on the number of subtypes or their anatomical patterns in order to avoid inference and interpretation limitations. After defining clusters of brain atrophy, we compared the clinical characteristics between different AD subtypes at baseline and after one year. In addition, we assessed the ability of the hippocampus to cortex volume ratio in discriminating AD groups to evaluate its utility as a marker of heterogeneity in AD, as was suggest by Whitwell et al. (2012) . We hypothesized that similar patterns of brain atrophy would be found compared to those described in previous neuropathological studies (Murray et al., 2011; Whitwell et al., 2012) .\nMoreover, we also predicted that these patterns would be associated with distinct cognitive profiles, highlighting the clinical relevance of studying the heterogeneity present in AD."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects", "text": "The dataset used in this study was obtained from two large multicentre cohorts, the AddNeuroMed and the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI).\nAddNeuroMed is an integrated project that is part of InnoMed (the Innovative Medicines Initiative) and funded by the European Union Sixth Framework program (Lovestone et al., 2007 (Lovestone et al., , 2009 . The main objective of AddNeuroMed is to identify biomarkers or experimental models that can improve diagnosis, prediction and M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P T E D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 6 monitoring of disease progression in AD. Regarding neuroimaging, AddNeuroMed uses magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectoscopy (MRS) to extract valuable information for the identification of AD biomarkers (Westman et al., 2011) . The MRI data for AddNeuroMed was collected from different centres across Europe (Lovestone et al., 2009; Simmons et al., 2009 Simmons et al., , 2011 and University of Toulouse (France). AD patients were recruited from the memory clinics of each of the six participant sites using the following inclusion criteria: 1) fulfilling with the ADRDA/NINCDS for probable AD and DSM-IV criteria for dementia AD; 2) mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score between 12 and 28; 3) age 65 years or above. Exclusion criteria for AD patients consisted of any major unstable systematic organ failure, and significant psychiatric or neurological diseases apart from AD. Controls from AddNeuroMed were recruited from social centers for the elderly or GP surgeries, caregiver's or unrelated family relatives using the following inclusion criteria: 1) MMSE score between 24 and 30; 2) age 65 years or above; 3) geriatric depression scale equal to or less than 5; 4) stable medication; 5) good general health; 6) a clinical dementia rating (CDR) score of zero. Exclusion criteria for controls consisted of fulfilling criteria for dementia (DSM-IV), significant neurological, psychiatric or unstable systematic illness and organ failure.\nThe ADNI was launched in 2003 as a public-private partnership, led by Principal Investigator Michael W. Weiner, MD. The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial MRI, PET, other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of MCI and early AD. Similarly to the AddNeuroMed study, ADNI strives to reveal sensitive M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P T E D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 7 and specific markers of AD progression in patients from various sites to support the development of new treatments and monitor their effectiveness, as well as to reduce the expenditures of clinical trials. The inclusion criteria for AD patients from ADNI were the following: 1) fulfilling the NINCDS/ADRDA criteria for probable AD; 2) MMSE score between 20 and 26; 3) CDR score of 0.5 or 1.0. Exclusion criteria comprised history of structural brain lesions or head trauma, significant neurological disease other than incipient AD, and the use of psychotropic medications that could affect memory. The inclusion criteria for controls were: 1) MMSE between 24 and 30; 2) CDR score equal to zero. Presence of depression, mild cognitive impairment and dementia were used as exclusion criteria for this group. For more information on the ADNI study, see www.adni-info.org.\nInformed consent was obtained from all subjects included in this study. For AD patients, consent was obtained both from the patient and a relative. In the AddNeuroMed cohort, the Alzheimer's disease assessment scale (ADAS) was substituted by the CERAD cognitive battery to assess cognitive functions in controls.\nThe only comparable measure between CERAD (The Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease) and ADAS cognitive batteries is the word recall task (Westman et al., 2011) . Therefore the comparison between AD subtypes and controls regarding the ADAS subtests is limited to the word recall subtest."}, {"section_title": "MRI acquisition", "text": "The MRI data from ADNI and AddNeuroMed were acquired using the same protocol (Jack et al., 2008) , which consisted of a high-resolution sagittal 3D T1-weighted MPRAGE volume (voxel size 1.1\u00d71.1\u00d71.2 mm 3 ) (Westman et al., 2011) . Full brain and scull coverage was required for both cohorts, and image quality control took M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P T E D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 8 place according to the AddNeuroMed's quality control procedure (Simmons et al., 2009 (Simmons et al., , 2011 . Similarly to previous studies (Pereira et al., 2016; Spulber et al. 2013; Falahati et al. 2016) , the data from both cohorts were combined since they show similar patterns of atrophy and predictive power in discriminating AD and MCI patients from controls (Westman et al. 2011 )."}, {"section_title": "MRI preprocessing", "text": "T1-weighted images were preprocessed using FreeSurfer (version 5.3; http://freesurfer.net/), which provides cortical and subcortical measures of gray matter volume that can be used for statistical analyses. All data was preprocessed through the HiveDB database system (Muehlboeck et al., 2008) . The FreeSurfer preprocessing stream consists of several steps: correction of motion artefacts and spatial distortions; removal of non-brain tissue (Segonne et al., 2004) ; transformation to the Talairach standard space; intensity normalization (Sled et al., 1998) segmentation of subcortical white matter and deep gray matter structures; tessellation of the gray/white matter boundary; automated topology correction (Segonne et al., 2007) ; and surface deformation to place the gray/white and gray/CSF borders (Fischl and Dale, 2000) .\nOnce the cortical models were complete, registration to a spherical atlas took place, which utilizes individual cortical folding patterns to match cortical geometry across subjects (Fischl et al., 1999) . This was followed by parcellation of the cerebral cortex into 148 cortical regions (Destrieux et al., 2010) . In this study, we extracted the volumes from these cortical regions in addition to seven gray matter subcortical structures for each hemisphere: hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus, caudate, putamen, accumbens and pallidum (Fischl et al., 2002) . We also obtained the estimated total intracranial volume (ICV), an indirect measure of head size, from FreeSurfer Buckner et al., 2004) . In this study we used volume measures because they are available for cortical and subcortical regions in contrast to cortical thickness, which is not available for subcortical structures in FreeSurfer."}, {"section_title": "Cluster analyses", "text": "In total, 162 volume measures (148 cortical and 14 subcortical) ( Supplementary Table   1 and 2) were included in the cluster analyses to assess different patterns of brain atrophy in AD patients. To correct these volume measures for head size, we applied a residual approach using previously established methods (O'Brien et al., 2006; Voevodskaya et al., 2014) . The adjusted volumes were obtained as follows:\nwhere \u202b\u0741\u0749\u0751\u0748\u0738\u202c \u0bd7 is the ICV-adjusted volume of interest (VOI), \u202b\u0741\u0749\u0751\u0748\u0738\u202c is the original uncorrected VOI, \u073e is the slope calculated from the linear regression of \u202b\u0741\u0749\u0751\u0748\u0738\u202c of each brain region to the \u202b\u0738\u0725\u072b\u202c in controls, \u202b\u0738\u0725\u072b\u202c is the subject's ICV, and \u202b\u0738\u0725\u072b\u202c \u0d24\u0d24\u0d24\u0d24\u0d24 is the mean ICV across all subjects. We performed cluster analyses on the adjusted 162 regional volumes of AD patients from ADNI and AddNeuroMed using the random forest method (Breiman, 2001) implemented in R (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing; version 3.2.3). The random forest method is an ensemble classifier consisting of many decision trees (Breiman, 1996) , where the final result is obtained by combining the predictions of all individual trees. This method combines random feature selection (Amit and Geman, 1997) and bootstrap aggregation (Breiman, 1996) , which is important to prevent data overfitting and increase the prediction power.\nThe random forest architecture allows the computation of a similarity (proximity) measure between pairs of observations (Shi and Horvath, 2006 ). If we assume M A N U S C R I P T"}, {"section_title": "A C C E P T E D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT", "text": "10 observations i and j, their similarity measure \u202b\u074f\u202c \u0745\u0746 initializes in zero. Each tree then decides to assign observations together on a certain class by directing them on the same terminal node. Each time the pair i and j end up on the same terminal node, the similarity measure \u202b\u074f\u202c \u0745\u0746 increases by one. At the end of the process, the similarities are symmetrized and divided by the number of trees. If a dataset has N observations, the resulting pairwise similarity matrix consists by N*N elements. We chose to use the random forest similarity measure instead of a conventional distance measure (e.g.\nEuclidean) due to the following reasons: a) it carries information regarding the linear and nonlinear interactions of the variables under assessment; b) it provides measures of variable importance; and c) it carries no cluster distribution assumptions.\nThe random forest classifier distinguishes synthetic from observed data if the latter has inherent clusters (Shi and Horvath, 2006) . As observed data we used the AD dataset, while as synthetic data we used a dataset that was drawn from a reference distribution such that there is no relationship between observations or variables (Shi and Horvath, 2006) . The Addcl1 method was used in the current study for constructing a synthetic dataset (Shi and Horvath, 2006) . Using this method, first we randomly sampled one value from the spectrum of observed values in the first variable of the dataset. The same process was repeated for all the variables resulting in one synthetic observation with in-dependency over variables. A synthetic class was defined by combining the observed and synthetic datasets and labeling them as class 1 and 2, respectively. In order to group patients into clusters, we applied the random forest algorithm to the dataset and extracted the similarity matrix. Additionally, we applied classical multidimensional scaling (MDS) to the similarity matrix to extract a lower dimensional representation of the similarity matrix since the Addcl1 random forest similarity performs well in conjunction with the MDS (Shi and Horvath, 2006;  M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P T E D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT similarity of the subjects in the Euclidean space as well as observe which clusters were sparse. Finally, we applied an agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm with average linkage (Gray et al., 2013) . This hierarchical clustering method starts by assigning every subject to one cluster. The average linkage uses the mean distance between elements of each cluster as a criterion for merging two clusters together. The algorithm continues merging subjects into clusters until all the subjects form a single group. Then, the desirable cut off (number of clusters) can be decided by using a clustering evaluation criterion or by inspecting the low dimensional coordinates of the data. In this study, we assessed the clustering quality for different number of clusters with six indices and finally used the average Hopkins statistic (Banerjee and Dave, 2004) to decide the cut off value (Supplementary material 2.2). The Hopkins statistic assessed clustering tendency where values between 0 and 0.5 reflect heterogeneous clusters, values around 0.5 reflect clusters that are homogeneous between themselves, and values greater than 0.5 reflect very well defined clusters.\nThe random forest algorithm induces perturbations in the subject population by design through the bootstrapping feature. Every tree of the forest uses only a subset of the data, which consists of 70% of the original dataset randomly chosen (with replacement) and then the model is validated in the remaining 30%. To further assess the reproducibility of the results, we repeated the random forest 100 times with random seeding and computed the average change in the similarity measures. More information about the random forest parameterization, its evaluation, reproducibility, and the clustering validity can be found in the supplementary material 2.1 and 2.2.\n16 of the orbital gyri separated the hippocampal-sparing (high values) from the diffuse 2 subtype (low values). Other variables such as the superior temporal, precentral and superior parietal gyri contributed less to the discrimination of the first branch of subtypes. The parietal superior together with the superior occipital gyri were less, but still important variables regarding the discrimination of the diffuse 2 from the hippocampal-sparing subtypes. A complete view of the variable discrimination rules between subtypes is available through the tree representation of the model (Figure 4 ).\n17 studies. In line with these findings, our results showed that a similar proportion of patients (27.8%, n=83) did not present a diffuse pattern of brain atrophy, which is usually found at late stages of AD. Among these patients, 4% (n=12) were characterized by volume loss in medial temporal and limbic regions, including the hippocampus, anterior temporal poles, insula, orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate gyri. In addition, 5.7% (n=17) were characterized by atrophy in the parietal cortex, superior frontal and posterior temporal regions, with relative sparing of the medial temporal cortex and hippocampus. These two subtypes fit well with the description of atypical AD presentations shown in previous studies (Whitwell et al., 2012; Noh et al., 2012; Hwang et al., 2016) , suggesting that structural MRI is a good biomarker to assess AD heterogeneity. The frequency of hippocampal-sparing patients we found in our study was similar to the one reported in previous studies (Hwang et al., 2016; Byun et al., 2015) , while the frequency of the limbic predominant was somewhat different from previous studies probably to methodological approaches (Hwang et al., 2016; Byun et al., 2015; Ferreira et al., 2017) . Moreover, we also found that 18.1% (n=54) of patients had minimal brain atrophy showing volume loss only in the left entorhinal region. This finding is in line with three recent studies showing that some AD patients do not show significant brain atrophy compared to controls (Byun et al., 2015; Dong et al., 2017; Ferreira et al., 2017) , indicating that there might be a greater variability in brain atrophy patterns in AD than previously thought. Two of the recent studies that used the ADNI cohort (Byun et al., 2015; Ferreira et al., 2017) , found that the levels of CSF A\u03b2 1-42 and total tau were abnormal in the minimal atrophy subtype and in between the typical and the limbic-predominamt subtypes. These findings indicate that the minimal atrophy subtype is more likely to have Alzheimer's disease etiology rather than depression or other psychiatric illnesses.

Hence, their patterns of brain atrophy might be characteristic of AD patients with a more advanced age.

These regions include the posterior and frontoparietal cortices and could be responsible for greater impairment in visuospatial or executive functions (van der Flier., 2011) . There is also evidence showing that early onset AD might have a more aggressive disease course, showing a faster cognitive decline compared to the late onset cases (Van der Vlies, 2007) . Our findings are in line with this notion since the hippocampal-sparing group showed a significant decline in visuospatial and memory functions after one year. The decline in visuospatial functions agrees with the widespread parietal atrophy these patients presented and the strong association that exists between the parietal cortex and visuospatial and visuoconstructional abilities (Cabeza and Nyberg, 2000) . Previous studies using functional MRI (fMRI) have shown that memory not only relies on temporal brain areas but also the prefrontal cortex, which is important for episodic memory encoding and semantic retrieval (Cabeza and Nyberg, 2000) . This region was atrophied in the hippocampal-sparing cases of our study, suggesting that it might be responsible for the memory decline they showed after one year.\nIn this study we found that patients with diffuse atrophy presented lower scores on the MMSE compared to the other groups, indicating that widespread brain atrophy was associated with greater overall cognitive impairment.

In our study, this ratio distinguished well the limbic-predominant, hippocampal-sparing and diffuse subtypes but not patients with the minimal atrophy subtype. This was because patients with minimal atrophy had the highest cortical volume, but their hippocampal volumes were lower than the hippocampal-sparing subtype. This is a numerical issue that arises from the ratio's formula and is not connected with the progression of the subtypes or their similarity.\nSince the AD subtypes atrophy patterns were not linear, it was not possible to distinguish them well using the previous ratio. Multiple anatomical brain measures and their non-linear relationships are needed to separate well different AD subtypes.\nRegarding the supervised analysis, the precuneus, middle occipital and orbital gyri were the most important anatomical regions that helped discriminate clusters of patients ( figure 4) . The precuneus has been widely studied in AD and atrophy in this area has been associated with an early disease onset (Karas et al., 2007) . The subtypes with the lowest precuneus volume were the hippocampal-sparing and the diffuse 2.\nThe extent of atrophy in the hippocampal-sparing subtype can be explained by its onset, which is the earliest among the subtypes. As for the diffuse 2 subtype, the reason why the volume in this area was low is probably related to the severity of this subtype in contrast to the rest of the subtypes with respect to cortex volume (Figure 3,   A) . The volumes of the middle occipital gyrus separated the minimal-atrophy subtype from the other two subtypes of this branch and the interpretation of this is straightforward, since the minimal atrophy group showed no atrophy in that region.\nThe orbital gyrus was the cortical area that distinguished the hippocampal-sparing and diffuses 2 subtypes. The hippocampal-sparing does not show atrophy in limbic M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P T E D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 21 regions, including the orbital gyrus, and therefore its discrimination from the diffuse 2 subtype is feasible using this region.\nOur study has a few limitations. The cross-sectional design did not allow us to examine anatomical changes over time. CSF measurements were absent for more than 50% of the sample; therefore we were not able to investigate the link between A\u03b2 pathology and AD subtypes. The ROI approach in our analysis might have missed some subtle effects in cortical thinning.\nOur study also has several strengths. For instance, the application of the random forest method in the cluster analyses is an important advantage compared to previous studies since it takes into account both the high dimensionality and the non-linear relationships that exist between anatomical regions. The inclusion of both cortical and subcortical regions in our analysis is also a strength that allowed us to contrast better our results with previous neuropathological studies assessing AD subtypes, including the one called limbic-predominant, which is characterized by hippocampal atrophy.\nIn conclusion, our study is the first to assess the patterns of cortical and subcortical atrophy in AD using two different cohorts in the same clustering analysis. Our findings suggest there is substantial heterogeneity among AD patients and that this heterogeneity has an important impact on how patients progress over time, even after a short follow-up period of one year. Future studies examining brain atrophy in AD should be aware that several subtypes of neurodegeneration might be present in their cohorts and that this can influence clinical presentation and prognosis."}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgements", "text": "We would also like to thank the Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research (SSF), Comprehension of spoken language 0.29 (0.31) 0.33 (0.66) 0.50 (0.59) 0.45 (0.72) 0.47 (0.74) The data are presented as mean on the baseline (mean on the 12 months follow up).
