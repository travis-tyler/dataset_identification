[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The occurrences of geomagnetic storms cause harmful disturbances in the geo-space environment [Chapman and Ferraro, 1931]. Geomagnetic storms are caused by solar features, such as; (i) the coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and, (ii) high speed streams (HSS) from the Sun's coronal holes [Burlaga and Lepping, 1977, Gonzalez et al., 1994, Gopalswamy et al., 2009, Tsurutani et al., 2011. CME has two geo-effective components; sheath fields [Guo et al., 2011] and magnetic cloud fields [Burlaga et al., 1981, Lepping et al., 2015. Another driver of geomagnetic storms is the Co-rotating Interaction Region (CIR) and they (CIRs) are manifestations of HSS [Gosling, 1993, Gosling andPizzo, 1999]. Geomagnetic storms occurrences can significantly modify the ionosphere with resultant overbearing negative effects on space-and ground-based systems [NRC, 2008, Akala et al., 2013a. One of the ionospheric parameters which are easily modified by the occurrences of geomagnetic storms is the Total Electron Content (TEC). TEC is the number of electrons in a column of 1 m 2 cross-sectional area between the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) satellite and the receiver [Hofmann-Wellenhof et al., 1994]. Variations in TEC can cause range errors for navigation signals in the order of 1 TECU to 0.163 m range error at GNSS L1 frequency (1.5754 GHz) [Klobuchar, 1996, Akala et al., 2013a. It has been reported that sharp and rapid variations in TEC are sine qua non to occurrences of ionospheric plasma-density irregularities [Valladares et al., 1996, Akala et al., 2011. Ionospheric irregularities cause scintillations of radio waves [Kintner et al., 2007], and severe scintillations on the other hand can cause loss of signal and cycle slips to trans-ionospheric radio systems [Akala et al., 2012[Akala et al., , 2014[Akala et al., , 2015[Akala et al., , 2016[Akala et al., , 2017. During geomagnetic storms, equatorial/low latitude ionosphere is usually affected through the effect of PPEF [Vasyliunas 1970[Vasyliunas , 1972 and Disturbance Dynamo Electric Field (DDEF) [Blanc and Richmond, 1980]. PPEFs are eastward during the day, and westward at night [Senior and Blanc, 1984]. Its magnetic signature, known as Disturbance Polar number 2 (DP2) [Nishida, 1968] is caused by electric current systems related to magnetospheric convection electric field [Nava et al., 2016. Depending on its configuration, either eastward or westward, PPEF can affect \u00d7 drift, resulting in significant increase or decrease in TEC, as well as affecting the lifting of the post sunset F-layer to higher altitudes. Thus, the generation of irregularities through the \u00a92020 American Geophysical Union. All rights reserved. Rayleigh Taylor Instability (RTI) [Abdu, 2012] is affected by the presence of PPEF. DDEF results from the dynamo action of storm time winds generated by Joule heating [Blanc and Richmond, 1980] and manifests as a negative excursion in the daily horizontal component of the Earth's magnetic field. Its magnetic signature is referred to as the ionospheric disturbance dynamo (Ddyn) [Le Huy and Amory-Mazaudier, 2005]. Fejer et al. [2008] reported the seasonal and longitudinal dependence of equatorial disturbance vertical plasma drifts and concluded that opposite effects do exist between the magnitudes of PPEF and DDEF drifts across longitudes. As Fejer and Scherlies [1997] pointed out, prompt penetration drifts are mostly upward during the day and downward at night. The evening downward drifts have largest values in the eastern hemisphere, while the nighttime upward drifts maximize in the far Asia zone [Fejer et al., 2008, Fejer, 2011. Another longitudinal study by Kuai et al. [2016] revealed a difference in the ionospheric response in the Asian-Australian and the American sectors due to the effects of PPEF and DDEF during the storm of March, 2015. In a similar effort, Patra et al. [2016] linked the occurrence of strong irregularities during the storm of March, 2015 to an eastward PPEF which caused a strong uplift of the F-layer over the Indian longitude, while Amaechi et al. [2018a, b] attributed the inhibited ionospheric irregularities over the African longitude to DDEF effects during the storm of March, 2015. These observations imply that PPEF and DDEF exhibit remarkable local time dependence which plays an important role in the longitudinal difference in the responses of the low latitude ionosphere to geomagnetic storms [Kuai et al., 2016]. From the standpoint of ground-based measurements, one cardinal hindrance to our global understanding of the storm-time electrodynamics of the equatorial/low latitude ionosphere is the paucity of ionospheric studies over the oceanic regions, which is largely due to the challenges of installing ionospheric sensors on the surface of the oceans. Paradoxically, oceans cover about seventy percent of the Earth's surface. Although, over the past decades, satellite data have been quantitatively used to resolved the above concern [Burke et al., 2004, Gentile et al., 2006, Hei et al., 2005, Kil et al., 2009a, b, Huang et al., 2014, Huang and Hairston, 2015, Carter et al., 2016, Akala et al., 2017. However, satellites measurements could have inherent challenges, such as data adulteration by propagating medium interference, satellite altitude variations, instruments' calibration error due to age, data archival and retrieval errors, amongst others. For data integrity control, validation of satellite data with corresponding ground-based data remains sacrosanct. Akala et al. [2019] using ground-based GNSS receivers data, reported that coastal environments are more prone to ionospheric irregularities than landlocked areas. In a similar vein, Saito [2013] reported that GNSS stations surrounded by large bodies of water are vulnerable to multipath effects due to the fact that water bodies and ice act as good reflectors of GNSS signals. Additionally, heat absorption and circulations are predominant over the ocean surface than over the land [Forbes et al., 2007]. Consequently, the uneven heating of the atmosphere over the ocean leads to increase in atmospheric convections which create non-migrating tides that influence neutral wind circulations in the upper atmosphere [Fuller-Rowell et al., 1994], and invariably, influence the electrodynamics of the ionosphere [Hagan et al., 2001, Lau andYang, 2015]. Furthermore, previous studies on tsunamis have also provided evidences of the existence of connections between ocean surface gravity waves and acoustic gravity waves in the ionosphere [e.g., Hickey et al., 2009, 2010, Makela et al., 2011, Komjathy et al., 2012, Occhipinti et al., 2013. However, these studies only investigated ionospheric gravity waves after tsunamis had occurred, consequently, prediction of tsunamis prior to their occurrences, from the perspective of ionospheric dynamics remains an unresolved issue. Accordingly, detailed understanding of the physical processing involved in the ocean-ionosphere coupling is required for necessary parameterization and development of instrumentation for simultaneous monitoring of ocean surface gravity waves and ionospheric acoustic gravity waves on a global scale. From a theoretical perspective, Godin et al. [2015] connected surface gravity waves in the oceans with ionospheric acoustic gravity waves and their study was experimentally validated by Zabotin et al. [2016]. However, Zabotin's et al. [2016] data analysis only covered a specific region in the North Atlantic. These authors recommended global validation of their results. To this end, this study investigates the longitudinal variations of storm-time electric field, characterized alongside with TEC and ionospheric irregularities over the global oceanic regions during 28th May and 8th September, 2017 storms."}, {"section_title": "Data and method of analysis", "text": "Two intense (-200 nT\u2264 Dst \u2264 -100 nT) geomagnetic storms that occurred on the 28th of May, 2017 and 8th of September, 2017, respectively were studied. Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) and solar wind plasma data were measured by the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) satellite. ACE data were obtained at https//omniweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/hw/hmtl. ACE satellite is located close to the L1 Lagrangian point (a distance of about 240 RE from the Earth). This large distance causes propagation delay in the travel time of solar wind plasma and the embedded IMF from the satellite to the Earth's magnetosphere. For this reason, we normalized the data by a time shift of 52 minutes [Chakrabarty et al., 2005, Yizengaw et al., 2011, Amaechi et al., 2018b. ICME transients consist of the sheath and magnetic cloud fields. Sheath fields are usually behind a shock at the point when Bz turns southward with simultaneous sharp increase in all IMF and solar wind parameters (forward shock) or decrease in all these parameters, except increase in solar wind speed (reverse shock). Sheath fields are sandwiched in-between shocks and the leading edges of ICMEs. Magnetic cloud fields are associated with low solar wind temperature and solar wind density, preceded by shocks and sheath fields [Burlaga et al., 1981]. In addition to the southward turning of Bz, CIRs are diagnosed by sharp increase in the IMF and solar wind parameters, except solar wind speed and solar wind temperature \u00a92020 American Geophysical Union.

The Auroral Electrojet (AE), Polar Cap North (PCN) and Polar Cap South (PCS) indices were obtained from the World Data Center (WDC) for Geomagnetism, Kyoto (htpp://wdc.kugi.kyotou.ac.jp). We used ground-based magnetometers' data within the equatorial/low latitude strip around the oceanic regions to monitor changes in ionospheric currents during the storms.   1. ( 1)where n = 5 is the number of magnetic quiet days in a month. We used the International Quiet Days (IQDs), selected from the German Research Centre for Geosciences website (ftp://ftp.gfz-potsdam.de) as the magnetic quiet days. The day-by-day variability was accounted for by taking the standard deviation of H quiet during the magnetic quiet days. The ionospheric electric current disturbance (Diono) which is the magnetic effect of the disturbed ionospheric electric field current systems were estimated [Shimeis et al., 2012, Fathy et al., 2014, Azzouzi et al., 2015, Nava et al., 2016. where \u2206H in equation 2 [Nishida, 1968], while Ddyn is magnetic disturbance related to DDEF [Blanc and Richmond, 1980]. We used band-pass filter with bandwidth of 18-28 hours to extract Ddyn from Diono, while high-pass filter with a maximum pass period of about 4 hours was used to extract DP2 from Diono. We extracted Slant TEC (STEC) from GNSS observables data that were obtained from the University NAVSTAR Consortium (UNAVCO) website (htpp://www.unavco.org/data/data.html). The data were in Receiver Independent Exchange (RINEX) format and they were processed by Gopi TEC processing software [Seemala, 2010]. The carrier phase was leveled with pseudorange measurements. This further entailed detecting and correcting cycle slips [Blewitt, 1990] and calibrating STEC using satellite and estimated receiver biases [Ciraolo et al., 2007]. The calibrated STEC was converted to VTEC using mapping function at ionospheric pierce point of 350 km [Ma andMaruyama, 2003, Mannucci et al., 1993]. Multipath effects were eliminated by adopting an elevation cut-off of 30 o . VTEC is hereafter referred to as TEC. Ground-based TEC measurements were validated with SWARM A TEC measurements at ftp://swarm-diss.eo.esa.int/. SWARM is European Space Agency's constellation mission for Earth observation. The mission consists of three identical satellites (A, B, and C). SWARM A and C form the lower pair of satellites flying side-by-side (1.4\u00b0 longitudinal separation) at 470 km altitude, while SWARM B flies at 520 km altitude. We use rate of change of TEC index (ROTI) as proxy for ionospheric irregularities [Pi et al., 1997, Oladipo and Sch\u00fcler, 2013, Amaechi et al., 2018b, Zaourar et al., 2017, Yizengaw et al., 2018. where ROT in equation 4is the rate of change of TEC in TECU per minute. An irregularities threshold of 0.5 TECU/min was set for all visible satellite at cut off elevation of 30 0 . Finally, we used JASON-2 satellite sea level anomaly data (ftp://ftpcoastwatch.noaa.gov/pub/socd/lsa/johnk/coastwatch/j2) and optimum interpolation sea surface temperature data (https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oisst) to characterize the global ocean environments during the time intervals of the occurrences of the two storms. JASON-2 sea level anomaly data were not available during the 28th May storm. JASON-2 is a joint U.S./European Ocean Surface Tomography Mission flying at 1,336 km altitude. This period corresponded to the second southward turning of IMF Bz with a minimum value of -13.11"}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "28th May, 2017 GS event", "text": "nT. There were also noticeable features on PCN, PCS and AE indices at 1230 UT on the 29th of May. The storm finally recovered on the 31st of May.    The second CME arrived at the Earth at about 2330 UT on the 7th of September (vertical dash-lines). This storm is a dual-peak storm [Gonzalez et al., 1990]. SYM-H decreased to reach a minimum value of -132 nT at 0100 UT on the 8th of September, signifying the first minimum peak of the storm.    and 12th of September. From 3-13th of September, there were no irregularities over all the stations in the Pacific Ocean American longitude. Figure 15(a-f) shows the sea surface temperature and the sea level anomaly during the September 2017 storm and for other two days outside the storm. Sea surface temperature and sea level anomaly were also higher over the Pacific Ocean Asian longitude, and lower over the Pacific Ocean American longitude."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The two storms were caused by CME transients, i.e., manifestations of magnetic fields reconfigurations driven by magnetic reconnections [Dungey, 1961] at the Sun's coronal surface. The arrival of CMEs at the magnetosphere created the observed fast forward shocks that led to the SSCs for both storms (Figures 2 and 9). CME transient has two components, namely, magnetic cloud (a magnetic flux rope) [Burlaga et al., 1981, Lepping et al., 1990 and turbulent magnetic field regions (sheath regions) [Guo et al., 2011]. These regions are usually sandwiched in-between shocks and the leading edges of CMEs. Specifically, the storm of 28th of May, 2017 was driven by sheath and magnetic cloud fields, while the storm of 8th of September, 2017 was driven by sheath fields. The transit of solar eruptions from solar surface to the Earth's magnetosphere usually leads to transfer of energy into the magnetosphere [Sckopke, 1966]. During the occurrences of the two storms, there were enhancements in auroral currents (Figures 3 and 10). The influence of these high auroral currents manifested clearly in the enhancements of the observed auroral/high latitude TEC measurements by SWARM A satellite ( Figures 6 and 13 [Richmond and Roble, 1979;Sharma et al., 2011], which could extend from the high-to middle-and low latitudes [Mazaudier et al., 1985, Nava et al., 2016. These winds drag ionization to altitudes where recombination rates are significantly reduced, thereby causing enhancements in TEC, electron plasma density and other ionospheric parameters. These winds are responsible for global changes in thermospheric composition [Fuller-Rowell et al., 1994] and they are longitudinal dependent [Jones, 1971, Prolss, 1995. For the 28th May, 2017 storm, IMF Bz sharply turned southward around 2300 UT on the 27th of May, 2017 to herald the onset/SSC of the storm and caused SYM-H to rise suddenly in the positive direction ( Figure 2). The convection current also increased correspondingly during the time of the storm onset (Figure 3 [Nishida, 1968]. This electric field, termed PPEF [Vasyliunas, 1970;Senior and Blanc, 1984] is eastward and westward in the dayside and night-side, respectively [Hanson and Moffett, 1966, Abdu, 2012, Abdu et al., 1997. Short-term oscillations of Diono with a period around 30 minutes to roughly lesser than 3 hours, during southward turning of IMF Bz were very evident in DP2. DP2 are signatures of PPEF, while Ddyn are signatures of DDEF [Nishida et al., 1966, Hairston et al., 2016.  [Kikuchi et al., 1996]. The observed response of the ionosphere over the Pacific  [Huang et al., 2012, Immel andMannucci, 2013]. The hemispherical asymmetry in plasma distribution is attributable to the effects of neutral winds [Zaourar et al., 2017]. Over the Atlantic African longitude, Dakar (5.  [Blanc and Richmond, 1980;Le Huy and Amory-Mazaudier, 2005;Fathy et al., 2014]. DDEF is opposite in configuration to PPEF and longer in period (in the order of days), as such reduced TEC during the recovery phase of storms. The 8th September, 2017 daytime has a unique characteristic of two-step main phase. The arrival of the first shock was around the midnight of 6th of September. The second shock arrived almost at midnight of 7th of September but the IMF Bz turned sharply southward around 2200 UT on the 7th of September, 2017 to herald the onset/SSC of the daytime and caused SYM-H to rise suddenly in the positive direction (Figure 9). The convection current also increased correspondingly during the time of the storm onset (Figure 10). At the storm onset, Diono increased at Kourou, and decreased at fluctuations and minima. DDEF has been reported to be responsible for reduction in TEC in the dayside during the recovery phases of geomagnetic storms because of their westward orientation [Tsurutani et al., 2004]. During the recovery phase of the September storm, reduction in TEC was observed at Ascension Island on the 10-11th September. TEC enhancements were seen during the recovery phase of the storm in Solomon Island and Namria General Santos in the Pacific Ocean Asian longitude. Furthermore, during this event, a slight increase in TEC was observed some days before the storm (3-5th of September), mostly over the Pacific Ocean Asian and Pacific Ocean American longitudes. The increase in TEC was very obvious on the 4th of September (Figure 13). The enhancement in TEC observed on the 4-6th of September, despite the fact that these days were magnetically quiet days might be attributed to the solar flares that occurred during the period (www.spaceweather.com). As reported by Yasyukevich et al. [2018], these flares were accompanied by solar radio bursts, leading to increase in TEC. It is well known that X-rays and Extreme Ultra Violet (EUV) radiation have the capacity of increasing ionization in the ionosphere, especially on the dayside [Mitra, 1974, Tsurutani et al., 2009, Yan et al., 2018. Generally, over the equatorial/low latitude region, post-sunset eastward Pre-Reversal Enhancement (PRE) of \u00d7 drift supports the uplifting of F-layer altitude to create conducive environment where irregularities can be generated through the Rayleigh Taylor Instability (RTI) process [Abdu et al., 1995, Akala et al., 2014. However, if the electric fields are westward during post-sunset hours in the region, the uplifting of \u00d7 drifts is prevented, consequently, irregularities generation is inhibited. For the May, 2017 storm, irregularities were observed on the days before and after the day of the main phase of the storm. During the main phase of the storm, irregularities were triggered over stations located in the Pacific Ocean American longitude ( Figure 7). The main phase of the storm occurred at a period that corresponded to post-sunset hours at this longitude, the hours of the day which supports PRE generations. The generated PREs might have strengthened \u00d7 drift, thereby lifting the F-layer to altitude where the formation of irregularities was favourable [Sultan, 1996, Amaechi et al., 2018a. For the September, 2017 storm, irregularities were not conspicuous over all the longitudes (Figure 14). The times of the storm's onset and the storm main phase coincided with early morning, daytime and nighttime hours over all the longitudes. These hours do not support PRE generation. Consequently, irregularities were not observed over the longitudes. The irregularities inhibition on the 8th of September was driven by westward electric fields (DDEF). Over the Atlantic Ocean longitude, irregularities were present on the 7 and 10-11th of September; they were triggered by the eastward PPEF associated with the second turning of IMF Bz [Huang et al., 2017]. Finally, we also analyzed the observed pattern of irregularities distributions during the study period from the perspective of large-scale atmospheric circulation along the longitude-height plane over the equatorial Pacific Ocean (Walker Circulation) [Lau and Yang, 2015]. Walker Circulation features low-level winds blowing from east to west across the central Pacific Ocean, raising dynamics over the warm water of the western Pacific Ocean. The circulation is usually driven by the gradient of sea surface temperature along the equator, leading to coupling processes between tropical atmosphere and oceans. The warming of the western Pacific Ocean increases water vapour, latent heat, and upward motion in the atmosphere. The two phenomena which modify the annual air mass circulation of the Pacific Ocean are the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Madden Julian Oscillations (MJO) [Zeng andPyle, 2005, Zhang, 2005]. Both play significant roles in changing the air mass circulation over the entire Pacific Ocean and invariably, causing changes in air mass transport in the atmosphere. ENSO has two phases, namely, negative (El Nino) and positive (La Nina). El Nino involves anomalously warm sea surface temperatures, in the eastern and central Pacific Oceans which produces large changes in evaporation and latent heat transfer to the atmosphere [Zeng and Pyle, 2005]. The sea temperature anomaly causes the warmest sea surface temperature and convection that are normally found in the western Pacific Ocean at the expense of the eastern Pacific Ocean (Figure 8 and   15). These often lead to variations in surface pressure between the western and eastern Pacific  [Zeng and Pyle, 2005]. The dominance of intensity of TEC over the eastern and western Pacific Oceans manifested clearly in our data ( Figures 6 and 13). Furthermore, intensities of TEC were generally higher over the oceans than over the landlocked regions. We recorded stronger irregularities over the western Pacific Ocean longitude during the time when the sea surface temperature was significantly reduced. Negative sea surface temperature anomaly increases the wind system in the entire atmosphere and non-migrating waves in the upper atmosphere. This could have in turn enhanced ionospheric dynamo electric field. It is important to point out that the data used for the current analysis only spanned for a period of eleven days; five days before the main phase of each storm, and five days after, in addition to the day of the main phase of the storm. For this reason, to strengthen the conclusion on the possible influences of the ocean on the ionosphere, future analyses of large volume of data over long period of time are recommended."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "This work investigated the responses of the equatorial/low latitude ionosphere over the global oceanic regions to geomagnetic storms of May and September, 2017. We concluded that: 1. Both storms were caused by CME transients. A positive storm effect in TEC caused by eastward PPEF was observed over most of the longitudinal sectors on the day of the first storm (28th May, 2017 responses to the storm were generally low over the Atlantic Ocean and Indian Ocean longitudes because of the local time effects of PPEF. TEC enhancements observed on the 4-6th of September, geomagnetic quiet days were associated with the solar flares occurrences [Tassev et al., 2017, Lei et al., 2018. Furthermore, DDEFs generally manifested by weak Ddyn signatures after the main phases of the two storms were responsible for positive ionospheric responses during the recovery phases of the storms. 3. The first storm triggered irregularities over the Pacific Ocean longitude during lager PC and AE currents within 0700-1200 UT (for instance, this time range corresponds to 1830-2330 LT at Tahiti and 1300-1800 LT at Galapagos) on the storm day. This time range is the period for PREs, a time conducive for irregularities generation. For the second storm, irregularities were inhibited by westward DDEF occurrence during daytime morning/afternoon. This westward electric field cancels the PRE eastward electric field; hence hindering the generation of irregularities. These results validated model results by Blank and Richmond [1980] andFejer et al. [2008]. Furthermore, our results are in agreement with earlier results by Nayak et al. [2016a, b] and Amaechi et al. [2018a]. 4. The intensity of sea surface temperature and pressure has dependence on ionospheric TEC and irregularities. Our results showed that intensities of TEC were higher over the oceans than over the  Ddyn and DP2 signatures from Diono.
