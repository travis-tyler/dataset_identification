[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The tropical Pacific is characterized by the warm pool in the west and the cold tongue in the east. In the cold tongue region, the upwelled water is cool and rich in dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and nutrients, but iron-limited, which causes moderate productivity and strong CO 2 release to the atmosphere (Chavez and Barber, 1987;Feely et al., 1987). The position of the warm pool and the cold tongue fluctuates seasonally and interannually (Horel, 1982;Rasmusson and Carpenter, 1982;McPhaden and Picaut, 1990;Yan et al., 1992). Interannual fluctuation is associated with El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). During El Ni\u00f1o, upwelling weakens and the cold tongue retreats to the east. As a result, nutrient concentrations along the equator tend to be lower (Strutton et al., 2008), and the equatorial CO 2 outgassing in the tropics weakens and sometimes ceases completely (Feely et al., 1997;Ishii et al., 2014). The temporal variation of surface ocean partial pressure of CO 2 (pCO 2 ) and air-sea CO 2 flux along the equator, and their spatial distribution for specific years have been presented by many studies (Feely et al., 1995(Feely et al., , 1997(Feely et al., , 1999(Feely et al., , 2002(Feely et al., , 2006Takahashi et al., 2003;Ishii et al., 2009;Sutton et al., 2014). Previous studies have also shown contrasting ENSO signals between eastern and western tropics (Patra et al., 2005;Ishii et al., 2014;R\u20ac odenbeck et al., 2015) and changes in decadal trends (Takahashi et al., 2003;Feely et al., 2006;Ishii et al., 2009Ishii et al., , 2014. Most of the observation-based estimates employed statistical relationship between pCO 2 and other variables, such as sea surface temperature (SST). However, these relationships are not uniform in time or space. Assuming consistent relationships across time and space scales, or classifying wide areas including coastal zones into the same biome, may cause uncertainties (Wanninkhof et al. 2013;Wang et al., 2015). Although various statistical estimates and biogeochemical model simulations of CO 2 are qualitatively consistent when they are averaged over the tropical Pacific and for the several decades (Ishii et al., 2014;R\u20ac odenbeck et al., 2015), temporal variation shows substantial differences (R\u20ac odenbeck et al., 2015) and difference in spatial variation has not been presented yet. Furthermore, spatio-temporal variations of CO 2 in models are still biased (Wang et al., 2006;Valsala et al., 2014) and underlying mechanisms controlling the variations are different (Jiang and Chai, 2006). In terms of nutrients, spatio-temporal variability has not been characterized yet even at the surface. This study synthesizes sea surface pCO 2 and nutrient observations in the tropical Pacific (20 \ufffd S-20 \ufffd N) from 1981 to 2015, and grids them using interpolation. For the interpolation, we estimate e-folding scales and signal-to-noise ratios by measured values themselves, instead of any pre-assumed relationships with other explaining parameters. Using the gridded products, we characterize pCO 2 and nutrient basin-scale spatiotemporal variabilities. To enhance and redesign internationally-coordinated observations of the tropical Pacific, the Tropical Pacific Observing System 2020 project (TPOS2020; tpos2020.org) was initiated in 2014. Gasparin et al. (2015) showed that existing oceanographic observations by moored buoys, satellite altimeters and Argo floats can represent the intra-seasonal to interannual variability in temperature, salinity and sea surface height. Focusing on biogeochemical variables, we present the current and historical state of the observing system for sea surface pCO 2 and macro-nutrient observations and characterize the spatio-temporal variabilities captured by those observations."}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "We used surface water pCO 2 mearsurements (converted from the fugacity of CO 2 values; a correction of <1%) from the Surface Ocean CO 2 Atlas version 5 (SOCATv5; Bakker et al., 2016; http://www.socat.info/). The total number of measurements in the tropical Pacific (20 \ufffd S-20 \ufffd N) from 1981 to 2015, is about 2 million ( Fig. 1). Almost all 1 \ufffd grid cells are populated with measurements, especially along Tropical Atmosphere Ocean (TAO) array mooring longitudes serviced by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), US (Feely et al., 2006), along the ship of opportunity (SOO) line between Japan and New Zealand occupied by National Institute for Environmental Studies, Japan (NIES; Nakaoka et al., 2013), and along SOO line between Long Beach and New Zealand by NOAA (Quay et al., 2009) (Fig. 1a). The number of the mearsurements increased in the early-1990s when routine NOAA observations along TAO arrays were started, and then in the mid-2000s when SOO observations by NIES and NOAA were started (Fig. 1b). Surface nutrient (phosphate, nitrate, and silicate) measurements obtained from water depths shallower than 10 m were extracted from the Global Ocean Data Analysis Project version 2 (GLODAPv2; Olsen et al., 2016) and the World Ocean Database 2013 (Boyer et al., 2013). Duplicates with data archived in GLODAPv2 were excluded from WOD13. We also used surface samples of nutrients collected by the NIES (Yasunaka et al., 2014). The total number of measurements is about 20, 000 of each variable. Repeated observations are limited mainly to the 137 \ufffd E and 165 \ufffd E lines occupied by Japan Meteorological Agency (Oka et al., 2017), along the SOO ship route between Japan and New Zealand by NIES (Yasunaka et al., 2014), and in the coastal region of South America by Instituto del Mar del Peru (Echevin et al., 2008, Fig. 2a). The density of the data is around the same level from the 1980s to recent years (Fig. 2b). The numbers of phosphate and silicate samples are similar to that of nitrate throughout the analysis period. SST data were obtained from Hadley Centre Sea Ice and Sea Surface Temperature data set (HadISST) with a 1 \ufffd \ufffd 1 \ufffd monthly resolution (Rayner et al., 2003; https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/hadisst/). Sea surface salinity (SSS) data were obtained from quality controlled ocean temperature and salinity monthly objective analyses version 4 by the Met Office Hadley Centre (EN4; https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/ha dobs/en4/; Good et al., 2013). Zonal mean data for the atmospheric CO 2 mixing ratio (xCO 2 ) were retrieved from the NOAA Greenhouse Gas Marine Boundary Layer Reference data product (Conway et al., 1994; http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/mbl/index.html) and were interpolated into 1 \ufffd \ufffd 1 \ufffd \ufffd 1 month grid-cells. Sea level pressure, 6-hourly 10-m wind speed data, and zonal wind data were obtained from the U.S. National Centers for Environmental Prediction-Department of Energy Reanalysis 2 (NCEP2) (Kanamitsu et al., 2002; http://www.esrl. noaa.gov/psd/data/gridded/data.ncep.reanalysis2.html). As a comparison with our gridded products, we used the seawater pCO 2 gridded products by Landsch\u00fctzer et al. (2016; https://www.nodc. noaa.gov/ocads/oceans/SPCO2_1982_present_ETH_SOM_FFN.html; ET H_SOM-FFN) and Iida et al. (2015; http://www.data.jma.go.jp/gmd/ kaiyou/english/co2_flux/co2_flux_data_en.html; JMA_MLR). ETH_SOM-FFN was estimated by a combined two-step neural network (a self-organizing map and a feed-forward network) approach with SST, SSS, mixed layer depth, and chlorophyll-a. JMA_MLR was estimated using multiple linear regression of SST, SSS, and chlorophyll-a. We also used nutrient climatologies from World Ocean Atlas 2013 (WOA13) (Garcia et al., 2014; https://www.nodc.noaa.gov/OC5/woa13/), which   were made by an interpolation of observations."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Gridding of pCO 2 and nutrient measurements", "text": "We averaged the surface water pCO 2 measurements onto 1 \ufffd \ufffd 1 \ufffd monthly grid boxes for each year from 1981 to 2015 with statistical quality control to assure the gridded data were not affected by erroneous measurements or short-term and small-scale extreme conditions. We did this after normalizing pCO 2 to the reference year 2005 based on changes in the atmospheric CO 2 , as done by Takahashi et al. (2002) to avoid bias in the long-term mean field. Separate treatment of the long-term trend also avoids reduction of the long-term trend in the resultant data from optimal interpolation (Reynolds and Smith, 1994). As reference values for quality control, we calculated the long-term monthly mean and its standard deviation for each 1 \ufffd \ufffd 1 \ufffd grid-cell. Window size for the mean was set to \ufffd2 \ufffd of latitude, \ufffd5 \ufffd of longitude, and \ufffd1 month (regardless of the year) for pCO 2 , and \ufffd5 \ufffd of latitude, \ufffd15 \ufffd of longitude, and \ufffd2 months for nutrients. The size of the window was set so that the number of measurements in the window was at least 100. We then eliminated measurements in each grid-cell that differed by more than three standard deviations from the long-term mean. We again calculated the long-term mean and its standard deviation, and eliminated measurements that differed from the long-term mean by more than three standard deviations. This procedure identified in total about 0.5% of the measurements as extreme values. These excluded measurements were randomly distributed in time and space, except for some in the coastal region because of the locally high values. Finally, the remaining measurements were binned into 1 \ufffd \ufffd 1 \ufffd \ufffd 1 month grid-cells from 1981 to 2015."}, {"section_title": "Calculation of monthly climatology", "text": "We calculated long-term monthly means of the quality-controlled gridded data obtained in section 3.1, and smoothed them by the exponentially weighted average with the same space and time constants as the window size used in section 3.1. We use the monthly climatologies for detecting the seasonal variation, and also as reference values to calculate anomalies for detecting the interannual variability. For SST, we calculated long-term monthly means by averaging monthly SSTs from 1981 to 2015."}, {"section_title": "Decorrelation analysis", "text": "By using pCO 2 anomalies of the quality-controlled gridded data obtained in section 3.1 from the monthly climatology in section 3.2, we calculated the data covariance at each 1 \ufffd \ufffd 1 \ufffd grid cell separated by a lag increment in the zonal, meridional, and temporal directions. Covariance at a latitude of la and a longitude of lo (Cov(la, lo)) in meridional direction are calculated by where X(la, lo, im) is pCO 2 anomaly at a latitude of la, a longitude of lo, and a month of im, \u0394la is a lag increment in the meridional direction, and < > is an average from January 1981 to December 2015. Cov(la, lo) in the zonal direction was calculated using X(la, lo, im) and X(la, lo \u00fe \u0394lo, im), and in time using X(la, lo, im) and X(la, lo, im \u00fe \u0394im). In the figures, we show normalized covariance, which is normalized to variance of monthly anomalies (i.e. the correlation coefficient). Decorrelation radius and signal-to-noise ratio can be obtained from the lag covariance. The covariance decays with increasing lag. We defined decorrelation radius as the constant value of the best fitted exponential decay line on the lag covariance. The covariance at lag 0 is the sum of the signal and noise variance, and the covariance at other lags is just the signal variance (Alaka and Elvander, 1972). Therefore, the difference in covariance between lag 0 and a very short lag approximately represents the noise variance. In our case, we used the difference between lag 0 and the minimum lags (i.e. 1 \ufffd in zonal and meridional directions and 1 month in temporal direction)."}, {"section_title": "Optimal interpolation", "text": "We applied optimal interpolation to the quality-controlled monthly data obtained in Section 3.1. Hosoda et al. (2008) presented detailed equations for the optimal interpolation used here. We used the monthly climatology obtained in Section 3.2 as the first guess. We also used the decorrelation radius and signal-to-noise ratio obtained from the covariance analysis in Section 3.3. For nutrients, the decorrelation radius and signal-to-noise ratio of pCO 2 were used since the decorrelation radius and signal-to-noise ratio of nutrients could not be retained due to lack of data (see Section 4.2.1). Window sizes for calculation of covariance matrices were set to be twice the size of the decorrelation radius. Finally, for pCO 2 , we added the atmospheric CO 2 change initially subtracted (see Section 3.1). As a result, pCO 2 and nutrient monthly values and the interpolation errors are obtained. We used these products to characterize the pCO 2 and nutrient interannual variabilities. For an easy comparison of the interpolation errors in time and space, the interpolation errors are normalized to the monthly anomalies at each grid point."}, {"section_title": "Regression analysis", "text": "To examine seawater pCO 2 and nutrient variabilities associated with ENSO, we show their regression patterns with the Ni\u00f1o 3.4 index, which is the SST anomaly averaged over 5 \ufffd N-5 \ufffd S 170 \ufffd W-120 \ufffd W and is the most commonly used index to define El Ni\u00f1o (Trenberth, 1997). For pCO 2 , we also show the linear trend. There are not enough nutrient data to detect a trend so they are not shown here. We calculated regression coefficients using the optimal interpolation results only where the interpolation square error ratios are less than 0.9 in order to avoid reduction of the signals (see Section 4.2.2). However, since the number of the interpolated results with low interpolation errors (square error ratios < 0.9) is limited especially for nutrients (see Section 4.2.2), the regression maps become noisy. Therefore, we also calculated regression coefficients from all interpolated results, which often underestimate the signal but are considered qualitatively reliable. Regression coefficients calculated from all interpolated results are sometimes opposite in sign to those calculated from the interpolated results with low estimation errors. It often happens where the observations are limited or the signals are weak. In that case, we consider the regression coefficients calculated from the interpolated results with low estimation errors are to be unreliable, and show just the sign of the regression coefficients calculated from all interpolated results."}, {"section_title": "Calculation of dissolved inorganic carbon", "text": "We calculated the value of total alkalinity (TA) from SSS and SST by using the simple empirical function Lee et al. (2006). The different coefficients \"a\" to \"e\" were specific to two regions in our analysis area: the equatorial upwelling region which was east of a line connecting , and [20 \ufffd S, 75 \ufffd W], and the remaining tropical region. From pCO 2 gridded products and TA estimates, we calculated sea surface DIC concentration, using the CO2SYS program (Lewis and Wallace, 1998;van Heuven et al., 2009) with the dissociation constants of Lueker et al. (2000). We also calculated salinity normalized DIC to a constant salinity of 35 (nDIC \u00bc 35 \ufffd DIC/SSS). Overall uncertainties of TA estimate against the observation were reported as 8.1 \u03bcmol kg 1 (Lee et al., 2006), and these uncertainties affect the DIC estimation by about 6.5 \u03bcmol kg 1 when no uncertainty is taken into account for other variables. Although a systematic bias in Lee's formulation was pointed out by Takatani et al. (2014), we used Lee's method in the present study because sea surface height data which Takatani's method requires are available only after 1993 (Kuragano and Kamachi, 2000) but the datasets used here date back to 1981. Using data after 1993, we confirmed the difference in TA value between Lee's method and Takatani's method is small in the tropical Pacific ( Fig. 5 of Takatani et al. 2014), resulting in the same uncertainty for both methods (not shown)."}, {"section_title": "Calculation of air-sea CO 2 fluxes", "text": "We calculated monthly air-sea CO 2 flux (F) values from the surface water pCO 2 (pCO 2w ) values estimated in Sect. 3.4 by using the bulk formula: where k is the gas transfer velocity and L is the solubility of CO 2 . The solubility of CO 2 (L) was calculated as a function of SST and SSS (Weiss, 1974). We converted the interpolated NOAA marine boundary layer xCO 2 data (Sect. 2.2) to atmospheric pCO 2 (pCO 2a ) by using monthly sea-level pressure data and the water-vapor saturation pressure calculated from monthly SST and SSS (Murray, 1967). The gas transfer velocity k was calculated by using the formula of Sweeney et al. (2007): where Sc is the Schmidt number of CO 2 in seawater at a given SST, calculated according to Wanninkhof (2014), and <W 2 > is the monthly mean of the second moment of the NCEP2 6-hourly wind speed. The coefficient 0.26 is based on Sweeney et al. (2007) but optimized for NCEP2 winds following Takahashi et al. (2009). Although uncertainty in CO 2 flux by wind product is not small as discussed by Wanninkhof (2014) and Chiodi et al. (2019), our estimate of CO 2 outgassing integrated in the tropics (18 \ufffd N-18 \ufffd S, 120 \ufffd E-70 \ufffd W) is 0.40 \ufffd 0.15 PgC yr 1 (mean \ufffd standard error) which is similar to the estimate of 0.44 \ufffd 0.14 PgC yr 1 by the synthesis study of Ishii et al. (2014)."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Seasonal variation", "text": "Surface seawater pCO 2 is high in the central to eastern equatorial region ( Fig. 3a). From January to March when the coastal upwelling weakens (Nigam and Chao, 1996), high pCO 2 values along the South American coast decline (Fig. 3g). As a result, pCO 2 in February shows its maximum value from 140 \ufffd W to 100 \ufffd W, while in August the maximum is east of 120 \ufffd W. Seasonal standard deviation in pCO 2 , as well as SST and DIC, is large in the eastern tropics cold tongue region (EQ-20 \ufffd S, east of 120 \ufffd W), and small in the western tropics warm pool region (10 \ufffd S-10 \ufffd N, west of 140 \ufffd W; Fig. 4a-c). Seasonal variation of pCO 2 is in-phase with seasonal variation of DIC and out-of-phase with seasonal variation of SST in the cold tongue regions; pCO 2 is high when and where DIC is high and SST is low (Fig. 3b, 3c and 3g). nDIC shows less north-south contrast in the eastern tropics, while the amplitude and phase of seasonal variation are quite similar to those of DIC (not shown there). These results imply that pCO 2 seasonal variation mainly depends on upwelling of subsurface cool, carbon-rich water. Seawater pCO 2 has a local maximum off the coast of Central America (Fig. 3a). This pCO 2 local maximum region corresponds well with the DIC local maximum region and the SST local minimum region in February (Fig. 3b and c), when coastal upwelling is maximum (Clarke, 1988;Fiedler et al., 2002;Xie et al., 2005). Seasonal variation of pCO 2 is in-phase with seasonal variation of DIC (and nDIC) and out-of-phase with seasonal variation of SST in that region as in the case of the cold tongue region (Fig. 3f), which implies that pCO 2 seasonal variation mainly depends on upwelling of subsurface cool, carbon-rich water in this region as Walker Brown et al. 2015showed in their regional study. In August, pCO 2 starts to increase with strengthening upwelling associated with the development of the Costa Rica Dome (Wyrtki, 1964;Fiedler et al., 2002). DIC increase would be diluted with the heavy rain in this season (Xie et al., 2005). The seasonal standard deviation in seawater pCO 2 and SST is large in the off-equatorial region north of 10 \ufffd N and south of 10 \ufffd S (Fig. 4a and  4b). pCO 2 is at a minimum north of 10 \ufffd N in the boreal winter, and south of 10 \ufffd S in austral winter, both of which are in-phase with the seasonal variation in SST (Fig. 3a, 3b, 3d and 3e). On the other hand, the seasonal variation of DIC is weak there (Fig. 3c, 3d, 3e, and 4c). The magnitude of seasonal variation in SST is about 5 \ufffd C at 20 \ufffd N 180 \ufffd and 20 \ufffd S 180 \ufffd ( Fig. 3d and e), which causes a pCO 2 variation of about 70 \u03bcatm (4.23% \ufffd C 1 ; Takahashi et al., 1993). This value is consistent with the magnitude of the seasonal variation in pCO 2 there, although pCO 2 peaks a few months before SST, which can be ascribed to DIC ( Fig. 3d and e). This suggests that pCO 2 seasonal variation mainly derives from thermodynamic effects in those regions. Surface nutrients show high concentrations in the cold tongue region (EQ-20 \ufffd S, east of 120 \ufffd W; Fig. 5a-c). Similar to DIC, seasonal standard deviations of nutrients are large there, and small outside (Fig. 4c-f). Nutrient concentrations are high in austral winter, and the seasonal variations are in phase with DIC (Figs. 3g, 5a, 5b, 5c, and 5g). Maximum concentration off the coast of Central America in boreal winter is prominent only in phosphate, which is in phase with DIC (Fig. 3c, 3f, 5a, and 5f). In the subtropics (north of 10 \ufffd N and south of 10 \ufffd S), nutrient concentrations are low all year ( Fig. 5a-e). Small seasonal standard deviations of nutrients in the subtropics are consistent with that of DIC ( Fig. 4c-f). High concentrations of silicate in the northwestern region (EQ-20 \ufffd N, 120 \ufffd E-160 \ufffd E) are related to several extreme values in the 1980s (Figs. 5c and S2), which could be measurement errors. Nitrate concentration in the eastern tropics is lower than expected from the Redfield ratio (N:P \u00bc 16:1); nitrate and phosphate concentrations are about 4-10 \u03bcmol kg 1 and 0.4-1.5 \u03bcmol kg 1 , respectively, which means the N:P ratio is about 7-10:1. The low N:P ratio could be attributed to denitrification in the subsurface hypoxic area, which is known as the oxygen minimum zone, although the N:P ratio of surface water is higher than the subsurface because of nitrogen fixation at surface (Deutsch et al., 2007;Meyer et al., 2017). Fig. 6 shows the normalized covariance of surface seawater pCO 2 monthly anomalies. The normalized covariance averaged at each 1 \ufffd latitudinal band decays with increasing distance (thin black lines in Fig. 6), although zonal covariance is noisy because most of the cruise Fig. 4.

Covariance averaged over the analysis region shows an approximate exponential decay (thick magenta dashed lines in Fig. 6). Constant values of the best fitted exponential decay lines, i.e. e-folding scales, are 13 \ufffd in the zonal direction, 6 \ufffd in the meridional direction, and 2 months in the temporal direction (thick green lines in Fig. 6). Gaps of the normalized covariance between lag 0 and lag 1 average 0.8. The signal-to-noise ratio is therefore set to 4 [\u00bc 0.8/(1-0.8)]. We used the e-folding scales and signal-to-noise ratio obtained here for the optimal interpolation (see Section 3.4). E-folding scales of nutrients were calculated to be 9 \ufffd in the zonal direction, 6 \ufffd in the meridional direction and 2 months in the temporal direction for phosphate, 7 \ufffd , 6 \ufffd , 1 month for nitrate, and 12 \ufffd , 13 \ufffd , 3 months for silicate. However, since pairs of nutrient data exist only in quite limited grids, covariance is quite scattered and an exponential decay fitting is not reasonable in many cases (not shown here). Therefore the e-folding scales and signal-to-noise ratio of pCO 2 were used for the optimal interpolation of nutrients."}, {"section_title": "Distribution of the interpolation error", "text": "Figs. 7 and 8 show normalized error variances of surface seawater pCO 2 and nitrate. For nutrients, we only present the error distribution of nitrate, but those for phosphate and silicate are quite similar. Interpolation error is small when and where there are observations nearby. For pCO 2 , the errors are small only along the 137 \ufffd E line in early 1980s, but also along several lines after that ( Fig. 7a-d). Three SOO routes and six pCO 2 mooring points can be seen in 2011 (Fig. 7d). Along the equator, the errors are small in almost all areas since the late 1980s, but the area where the errors are large appears again after the 2010s due to a reduction in regular ship visits (Fig. 7e). For nutrients, the error is small in the western region (west of 180 \ufffd ) due to frequent hydrographic observations since the early 1980s and SOO samplings after 2006 (Fig. 8). The error is large in the central to eastern region except for in the early 1990s when there were World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) and Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS) observations. Optimal interpolation results with large square error ratios tend to agree with the monthly climatology (Hosoda et al., 2008). We found the anomalies from the monthly climatology have small magnitudes when the square error ratios are more than approximately 0.9. This means that the optimal interpolation results with square error ratios >0.9 tend to underestimate the interannual variation. For pCO 2 , each 1 \ufffd \ufffd 1 \ufffd grid box in most of the tropical Pacific contains more than 30 data points where the interpolation square error ratios are less than 0.9 during the period from 1981 to 2015 (Fig. 9a). For nutrients, there are many grid cells which contain fewer than 10 data points in the central to eastern region, and the grid cells which contain more than 30 data points are only in the western tropics and in the coastal regions of Central and South America (Fig. 9b-c)."}, {"section_title": "Spatio-temporal variability", "text": "Interannual standard deviations of surface seawater pCO 2 and DIC anomalies are large along the equator, while standard deviations of nutrients are large in the eastern tropics (Fig. 10). The spatial patterns of the pCO 2 and DIC interannual standard deviations are different from that of the seasonal standard deviations, while spatial patterns of the nutrient interannual standard deviations are similar to those of the seasonal standard deviations (see Fig. 4). The pCO 2 and DIC interannual standard deviations along the equator are larger than the seasonal standard deviations, while those in the cold tongue region (EQ-20 \ufffd S, east of 120 \ufffd W) are comparable. Seawater pCO 2 decreases in almost all areas within the analysis area (20 \ufffd N-20 \ufffd S) when El Ni\u00f1o occurs; the significant negative anomalies spread over 5 \ufffd N-5 \ufffd S, and the pCO 2 decreases are the largest at the equator (Fig. 11a). Time series of pCO 2 anomalies along the equator clearly show the increase during La Ni\u00f1a and the decrease during El Ni\u00f1o between 147 \ufffd E and 110 \ufffd W (Fig. S1). The DIC signal shows a similar pattern to the pCO 2 signal, but the positive anomalies in the western off-equatorial region are more prominent in DIC than in pCO 2 . Also, the area with significant negative anomalies is larger in DIC than in pCO 2 (Fig. 11b). This is because the pCO 2 variation along with DIC variation in El Ni\u00f1o is partly compensated by temperature variation. A rise of 0.5 \ufffd C in SST, which is roughly the SST El Ni\u00f1o signal in the eastern equatorial Pacific (Fig. 11g), causes a pCO 2 rise of about 8 \u03bcatm (4% \ufffd C 1 ; Takahashi et al., 1993). The pCO 2 signal is about -10 \u03bcatm in the eastern equatorial Pacific (Fig. 11a), which means the signal is weakened by half by the temperature effect. West of 180 \ufffd , the SSS change associated with ENSO also affects DIC. During El Ni\u00f1o, SSS is low along the equator and high in the off-equatorial region in the western Pacific as shown by Delcroix (1998). This causes a decrease and increase in DIC, respectively. The nDIC signal in the western tropics is weaker than the DIC signal (not shown). The long term seawater pCO 2 trend is positive in all regions, and the area average is 1.84 \ufffd 0.07 \u03bcatm yr 1 (mean \ufffd standard error; Fig. 12a), which is slightly larger than the area average of atmospheric pCO 2 trend (1.66 \ufffd 0.01 \u03bcatm yr 1 ). The pCO 2 trend is not uniform in space, and is > 2 \u03bcatm yr 1 in most places in the eastern tropics (160 \ufffd W-90 \ufffd W) and along the equator. The long-term DIC trend is also positive in all regions (Fig. 12b). DIC trends, like pCO 2 trends, tend to be larger along the equator than offequator, and larger in the eastern tropics than in the western tropics. The DIC trend averaged over the analysis domain is 1.4 \ufffd 0.1 \u03bcmol kg 1 yr 1 . The nDIC trend in the western equatorial region (5 \ufffd N-5 \ufffd S, 144 \ufffd E-160 \ufffd W) is 1.0 \ufffd 0.1 \u03bcmol kg 1 . Nutrient concentrations tend to be low in the central to eastern equatorial region (10 \ufffd N-10 \ufffd S, 180 \ufffd -80 \ufffd W) when El Ni\u00f1o occurs (Fig. 11d-f), which aligns with the DIC variation (Fig. 11b). The time series of phosphate and nitrate anomalies at EQ 165 \ufffd E showed an increase during La Ni\u00f1a and a decrease during El Ni\u00f1o (Fig. S2), although the ENSO signals in other regions are unclear. Where data coverage is good in the west, the ENSO signal is weak; however, data are sparse in the east where we expect a stronger ENSO signal. The magnitudes of the phosphate and nitrate signals are smaller than expected from the Redfield ratio with the DIC signal, which would be due to an inadequate number of nutrient observations. We confirmed that the DIC signal is similar to the nDIC signal in the eastern equatorial region."}, {"section_title": "Interannual variability of winds and CO 2 fluxes", "text": "During El Ni\u00f1o, easterly winds weaken in the central to western tropics (Fig. 11h), which leads to weak upwelling of the DIC-rich subsurface water as shown in several equatorial locations (Feely et al., 2002(Feely et al., , 2006Ishii et al., 2009;Sutton et al., 2014). The contribution of atmospheric pCO 2 variability to the air-sea CO 2 flux variability is Fig. 6. Normalized covariance of the detrended seawater pCO 2 anomaly averaged at each 1 \ufffd latitudinal band (thin black lines) and averaged over the analysis region (thick magenta dashed line) for (a) zonal, (b) meridional and (c) temporal dimensions.

(2002) and Ishii et al. (2009) showed along the equator for several El Ni\u00f1o. Therefore \u0394pCO 2 is reduced in parallel with seawater pCO 2 (not shown). During El Ni\u00f1o, CO 2 outgassing is suppressed from 160 \ufffd E to 140 \ufffd W on the equator, but the CO 2 flux change is small in the other region (Fig. 11f). That is, the CO 2 flux averaged over the tropical Pacific is suppressed during El Ni\u00f1o. \u0394pCO 2 is reduced in the whole equatorial region as mentioned above, while the winds weaken from 160 \ufffd E to 140 \ufffd W, and strengthen west of 160 \ufffd E and east of 140 \ufffd W (Fig. 11i). Therefore, the suppression of CO 2 outgassing from 160 \ufffd E to 140 \ufffd W is due to the reduction of \u0394pCO 2 and weak winds, while the weak CO 2 flux change west of 160 \ufffd E and east of 140 \ufffd W at the equator is due to the opposing effects of \u0394pCO 2 reduction and strong winds. The trend in CO 2 outgassing is positive (i.e., CO 2 outgassing is strengthened) in boxes defined by EQ-15 \ufffd S, 140 \ufffd W-90 \ufffd W, and 2 \ufffd N-5 \ufffd S, 170 \ufffd E-160 \ufffd W, while it is negative around EQ, 150 \ufffd W, 10 \ufffd N, 140 \ufffd E, and 20 \ufffd S 160 \ufffd E (Fig. 12c). The strengthened CO 2 outgassing is related to the positive trend of \u0394pCO 2 (Fig. 12d), and the weakened CO 2 outgassing is related to the weakened surface wind (Fig. 12g). Since it is not uniform in space, the trend of CO 2 outgassing averaged over the entire tropical Pacific region is much less than the uncertainty (4 \ufffd 11 PgC yr 1 yr 1 ). In our analysis period , SST cooled in the central to eastern tropics (Fig. 12e), and zonal winds strengthened (Fig. 12f), which is similar to the negative Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) pattern (Mantua et al., 1997). Indeed, the PDO index shows a weak negative trend during the period from 1981 to 2015 (not shown). The expected global warming trend would be for SST to increase, especially in the eastern tropics, and the trade winds to be weakened (Tokinaga et al., 2011), which is the opposite to the trend from 1981 to 2015 presented here. Therefore, the spatial pattern of the long-term trend in pCO 2 obtained here is likely not associated with global warming but with the PDO. To detect the spatial pattern of pCO 2 and CO 2 flux associated with global warming, pCO 2 observations over a longer period are needed, to reduce the imprint of the PDO on the time series."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Comparison of spatial and temporal variability with previous studies", "text": "DIC-dependent pCO 2 seasonal variation in the eastern tropics cold tongue region (EQ-20 \ufffd S, east of 120 \ufffd W) in our study (see Section 4.1) is consistent with the modelling result of Wang et al. (2006). However, the negative correlation between SST and pCO 2 in our study is not consistent with other modelling studies (Jiang and Chai, 2006;Wang et al., 2015), yet is in line with observation-based results (Cosca et al., 2003;Feely et al., 2006). The seawater pCO 2 decrease along the equator during El Ni\u00f1o (see Section 4.2.3) is consistent with many other studies (Feely et al., 1999(Feely et al., , 2002(Feely et al., , 2006Ishii et al., 2009Ishii et al., , 2014, while we find the spatial breadth of the negative signal (Fig. 11a) separated from the seasonal variation whose standard deviations are comparable with the ENSO signal in some areas (see Fig. 4a). The seawater pCO 2 trend estimated in Section 4.2.3 is consistent with the previous time series analysis and area-averaged estimates as follows. Magnitudes of the trend at the central to eastern equator (170 \ufffd W-125 \ufffd W) in our study are 1.6-3.2 \u03bcatm yr 1 and quite similar to those reported by Sutton et al. (2014;1.6-3.3 \u03bcatm/yr at 170 \ufffd W, 155 \ufffd W, 140 \ufffd W, and 125 \ufffd W for 1997-2011), although they are not exactly consistent on a point-by-point basis. Our trend in the western equatorial region (5 \ufffd N-5 \ufffd S, 144 \ufffd E-160 \ufffd W) is 1.83 \ufffd 0.08 \u03bcatm yr 1 , which is larger than the estimate of Ishii et al. (2009; 1.4-1.6 \u03bcatm yr 1 ) due to the different time periods used in each study. Analyzing our product for the 1985-2004 period assessed by Ishii et al. (2009), we find a similar trend of 1.43 \ufffd 0.08 \u03bcatm yr 1 . nDIC trend in the western equatorial region is consistent with the estimate of Ishii et al. (2009;0.8-1.3 \u03bcmol kg 1 yr 1 ). The suppressed CO 2 outgassing averaged over the tropical Pacific during El Ni\u00f1o has been found in many previous studies (Feely et al., 1995(Feely et al., , 1997(Feely et al., , 1999(Feely et al., , 2002(Feely et al., , 2006Takahashi et al., 2003;Ishii et al., 2009;Sutton et al., 2014), but our results clarify that the signal is not uniform and shows large variability in space (see Section 4.2.4). Previous studies also showed contrasting ENSO signals between eastern and western tropics (Patra et al., 2005;Ishii et al., 2014;R\u20ac odenbeck et al., 2015), but the area of the suppression of CO 2 outgassing we presented is different to the areas presented in previous studies. Although strengthened CO 2 outgassing in the eastern tropics in recent years is consistent with the synthesis study by R\u20ac odenbeck et al. (2015), the positive trend area is not identical to the biome they used. Almost zero trend of CO 2 outgassing averaged over the entire tropical Pacific region is consistent with the synthesis study by Ishii et al. (2014). Decadal modulations of equatorial averaged pCO 2 and CO 2 flux trends have been reported by other studies (Takahashi et al., 2003;Feely et al., 2006;Ishii et al., 2014), while we further characterize the spatial distribution. Our estimates of the e-folding scales of seawater pCO 2 (Section 4.2.1) are larger and longer but in the same order with those estimates by Gasparin et al. (2015) in which e-folding scales of steric height were about 4 \ufffd -9 \ufffd in space, and 15 days in time. It is noted that e-folding scales in this study are larger than those presented by Jones et al. (2012; 400 \ufffd 250 km) since we focus on the interannual variability while Jones et al. (2012) performed their analysis on the pCO 2 distribution itself including long-term mean states. Fig. S3 shows time series at several points and spatial distribution in February 2012 in other seawater pCO 2 gridded products. All pCO 2 values from the gridded products follow well the pCO 2 values from measurements archived in SOCATv5. The root-mean-square (RMS) differences between pCO 2 values from gridded products and pCO 2 measured values in SOCATv5 are 0.68, 1.68, and 2.60 \u03bcatm, for our product, ETH_SOM-FFN, and JMA_MLR respectively. RMS differences among the pCO 2 values from each gridded product are 14.7-17.8 \u03bcatm. The pCO 2 values from gridded products agree with measured values, but the gridded values include large uncertainties when they are away from the observations in time and space."}, {"section_title": "Comparison with other gridded products", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Seawater pCO 2", "text": "Long-term monthly mean fields for ETH_SOM-FFN and JMA_MLR are generally similar with our results (Figs. S4a and S4b, compared to Fig. 3a). pCO 2 is high in the central to eastern equatorial region, and shows a local maximum off the coast of Central America. A slight discontinuity can be seen along 10 \ufffd S and 15 \ufffd S in JMA_MLR, which is the boundary of their biome (Fig. S4b). Seasonal cycles of JMA_MLR are consistent with our data in terms of both the phases and the amplitudes in every region (Figs. S4c-S4f). On the other hand, the seasonal cycle off the coast of Central America is different in ETH_SOM-FFN; it shows a much higher value (>450 \u03bcatm) from February to May than the other two products (Fig. S4e). High pCO 2 values sometimes appeared in November to February but not in March to May in SOCATv5, as pointed out by Walker Brown et al. (2015). This suggests the ETH_SOM-FFN may not adequately represent this local feature due to placement within the same biome as the subtropical South Atlantic (Landsch\u00fctzer et al., 2014), even though pCO 2 -SST relationships in these two regions are opposite (Takahashi et al., 2002). Seawater pCO 2 variations related to ENSO are similar in the gridded products; pCO 2 is low in the equatorial region when El Ni\u00f1o occurs (Figs. 11a and S5a). In JMA_MLR, slight discontinuity can be seen along 10 \ufffd S, and a positive pCO 2 signal south of 10 \ufffd S is significant. Both products show that the long term pCO 2 trends are larger in the central to eastern equatorial region than in the other region (Fig. S5b), which is consistent with our product (Fig. 12a). The long-term pCO 2 trends across the entire tropical Pacific region are 1.79 \ufffd 0.05 \u03bcatm yr 1 in ETH_SOM-FFN, and 1.86 \ufffd 0.04 \u03bcatm yr 1 in JMA_MLR, both of which are consistent with the area-averaged trend in our products (1.84 \ufffd 0.07 \u03bcatm yr 1 ). Other studies on pCO 2 variability in the tropical Pacific used correlations between SST and pCO 2 to estimate pCO 2 distribution (e.g. Cosca et al., 2003;Feely et al., 2006). The SST-pCO 2 relation is clear for the whole equatorial region at interannual time scales, but just in the upwelling region for seasonal variation (see Section 4.3). This introduces uncertainty of the estimated pCO 2 as Wang et al. (2015) implied through their model. Consequently, although similar spatio-temporal variability of pCO 2 is seen (see Section 5.1), they could include several artificial signals as shown in this section. Although our product does not show the meaningful signals in data sparse regions and time periods, uncertainty of the signals are illustrated by the interpolation errors. As a result of these estimated uncertainties, Fig. 9.

Spatial distributions of WOA13 are generally similar to those of our data, but WOA13 shows the unnatural large-scale meander of contours and local maxima along meridional lines (Figs. S6a-c). For example, the high concentration of silicate along 180 \ufffd appears inconsistent in time and among nutrient components. Unrealistic high concentration of silicate near the Philippines can be seen in WOA13 (Fig. S6c) as in our data (Fig. 4c). Seasonal cycles of WOA13 are vaguely similar to our products, but they are quite noisy (Figs. S6d-g). It should be noted that our product includes interannual variability as discussed in Section 4.2, while WOA13 does not."}, {"section_title": "Concluding remarks", "text": "Through synthesis of surface seawater pCO 2 and surface nutrient observations, we assessed their variability in the tropical Pacific. We separately characterized basin-scale distributions of the seasonal and interannual variability of pCO 2 and nutrients based on the gridded products which we developed using interpolation of measured values without any relationships with other variables. We also quantified the spatial distribution of the long-term pCO 2 trend beyond the areaaveraged trend published previously. Furthermore, the spatial patterns of the ENSO signal of nutrients were firstly presented. Our results will be useful for validation of ocean biogeochemical and Earth system models. Surface seawater pCO 2 observations can characterize pCO 2 and CO 2 flux interannual variability, but the recent decrease in the observation density and frequency in the central to eastern tropics is of great concern. Our estimates of e-folding scale suggest that underway pCO 2 observations by twice annual servicing of the TAO array along the latitudinal transects in every 15 \ufffd of longitude are suitable to capture the interannual spatial variability of pCO 2 , while more frequent observations by the SOO and moorings are better able to capture the temporal variation. Furthermore, since the magnitudes of long-term trends in a limited analysis period are affected by interannual variability such as the PDO, sustained monitoring is needed to identify the spatial pattern associated with longer term climate change. Nutrient observations are sparse in the central to eastern tropics, and are often not sufficient to quantify the interannual spatio-temporal variability. Installing nitrate sensors as part of underway observing systems and increasing the coverage of biogeochemical floats are promising ways to increase surface nutrient data. Fig. 11.

We found questionable silicate concentration data in EQ-20 \ufffd N, 120 \ufffd E 160 \ufffd E in the 1980s. They cannot be eliminated by simple statistical quality controls as a consequence of their large number. Close attention to data quality is needed especially for older data. Although the gridded pCO 2 products using empirical relationships have seemingly realistic values, we have to pay attention for several artificial signals which probably stem from the estimation methods. On the other hand, our products can be used to assess the pCO 2 variability if future users remove the values associated with large interpolation errors. Furthermore, our product shows the data deficit areas clearly, which would be useful for future observation planning. Data synthesis is as important as the observation itself to clarify the variability, especially at large spatial scales and on long temporal scales. Data archiving and quality control efforts such as SOCAT, GLODAP, and WOD should continue to be encouraged."}, {"section_title": "Declaration of competing interest", "text": "The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.
