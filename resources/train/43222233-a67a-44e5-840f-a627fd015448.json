INTRODUCTION", "text": "Thurston County has many features that make it an incredible place to live. We have lakes, rivers, streams, and the sparkling Puget Sound. Together with the friendliness and livability of our local communities, it's no wonder that more than 250,000 people call Thurston County home. Based on our latest forecast, the population is expected to soar to nearly 370,000 by 2030, making Thurston County one of the fastest growing counties in Washington State. Yet there are downsides to the rapid population growth in Thurston County. Growth in the wrong parts of the county can damage the health of our local watersheds. Damaged watersheds harm lakes, rivers, streams and ultimately Puget Sound, resulting in waterways that are unhealthy or even unusable for both people and wildlife. We have the tools to predict where growth is likely to occur, and the effect it may have on our streams, lakes and marine waters. This report documents the methodology used to estimate current and future impervious area, and to generate estimates of forest lands vulnerable to urban conversion in Thurston County. It is an important step in protecting our watersheds. This builds on work by TRPC and supported by the Stormwater Utilities of Lacey, Olympia, Tumwater, and Thurston County during the 2000s to: 1) Develop a land cover layer for Thurston County from satellite imagery 2) Develop relationships between land cover and impervious surfaces, and calibrate the data in a hydrologic model (HSPF) and, 3) Build a future impervious surface module into the Regional Population and Employment Forecast The update of this data set is part of a larger project called: Guiding Growth -Healthy Watersheds: Translating Science to Local Policy, which aims to accommodate future population growth while conserving our healthy watersheds and ultimately Puget Sound.

Impervious Area, Forest Cover and Stream Health", "text": "Numerous studies have shown that as impervious cover increases and forest cover decreases, stream quality decreases. Impervious surfaces are hard surfaces that stop water from infiltrating into the soil. They include things like rooftops, parking lots, roads, and even compacted lawns. Imperviousness decreases the ability of the ground to absorb water and recharge the aquifer (Figure 1). The increased volume and velocity of stormwater associated with impervious area erodes streambanks, causing flooding, habitat loss and degradation habitat, and fills the streambeds with sediment. Water flowing over concrete and lawns picks up contaminants such as nutrients from fertilizer, oil and grease from roads, pesticides, pet waste, and other pollutants from residential and commercial areas. These contaminants can have a negative effect on the biotic communities living in the aquatic ecosystem and also reduce the safety of water for drinking, swimming, and fishing.  (ARNOLD, 1996). Figure 2 shows the conceptual relationship between channel stability, impervious surfaces, and forest cover for rural Puget Sound lowland streams. The basis for this generalization is the empirical data showing a direct correlation between forest cover, impervious area, and stream conditions from a large number of studies (Booth et al., 2002). These studies indicate that it is important to maintain a forest cover of more than 60 percent, even where effective impervious area is fairly low (in the 2 to 6 percent range). As impervious area increases, the stabilizing effect of forest cover becomes increasingly important. There is no particular impervious threshold where degradation in stream integrity begins to occur -rather the relationship is a continuum.

Using Future Impervious Area and Forest Cover as a Tool to Predict Watershed Health", "text": "Estimates of future impervious area and forest cover loss can be used by a community to anticipate stream basin degradation, and take steps to prevent it before it occurs. The steps could involve guiding growth away from sensitive areas, minimizing the amount of new impervious surfaces using engineering techniques, or planning for the capture and treatment of stormwater runoff from new impervious surfaces. To assist in these planning efforts, TRPC first provided estimates of future impervious area for the Stormwater Utilities of Lacey, Olympia, Tumwater, andThurston County in 2007 (TRPC, 2007). This work linked the regionally adopted population and employment forecast, and stakeholder-reviewed land use inventory (buildable lands) to estimates of future impervious area. Impervious surfaces are any surfaces that are impermeable for water -such as roads, rooftops, sidewalks, and parking lots. In order to measure this directly, TRPC generated a satellite-derived land cover data layer with three urban classes: high intensity, moderate intensity, and low intensity (TRPC, 2001). This data layer was compared to more traditional ways of estimating impervious area through using land use classes, and found to be at least as reliable, if not more, at estimating total impervious area (TRPC, 2003). Another advantage of the satellite-derived land cover layer was that for the first time, impervious surface for all of Thurston County could be measured at once. This initial Thurston County mapping project (TRPC, 2001), provided essential data for planners in the region. This was followed by an effort to link land cover to total and effective impervious area, and integrate results into the Hydrologic Simulation Program -FORTRAN (HSPF) Model (TRPC, 2003). A simulation in Woodland Basin confirmed that this new way of measuring impervious area provided a useful data layer to support hydrologic modeling efforts in Thurston County. In 2007, after the most recent Regional Population and Employment Forecast was adopted, a future impervious surface module was added to the regional model (TRPC, 2007). For the first time, the culmination of adopted land use plans could be evaluated for the effect on stream basin health. In 2010 funding was received to continue this work, and further implement watershedbased land use planning in Thurston County. This provided the opportunity to update all data layers to reflect changes in buildable lands, land use, zoning, and population and employment projections. In 2013 a module to identify forest lands vulnerable to urbanization was developed within the framework of the Population and Employment Forecast model. This provided another data tool for decision making. Estimates of Current and Future Impervious Area and Vulnerable Forest Lands -8 The updated estimates will be used to evaluate the risk of stream basin degradation due to expected increases in urbanization for the basins in Water Resource Inventory Areas (WRIAs) 13 and 14, and help prioritize efforts in watershed-based land use planning.

Base Year Estimates of Total Impervious Area", "text": "In the early 2000s the Federal Government (Multi-Resolution Land Characterization (MRLC) 2001 began to develop a National Land Cover database (Homer et al., 2004;Yang, 2003). This was an effort of a consortium of Federal agencies -including USGS, EPA, NOAA, and USFS. One of the products of this effort was an impervious surface data layer, mapping impervious area to one percent thresholds (each mapping unit was assigned an impervious area percentage that ranged from zero to 100). This was accomplished by relating a land cover classification (using combined spring, summer, and fall data) to one-meter digital orthophotography. This enhances the coarser-scale Landsat satellite data derived land cover (30 meter resolution) to a much more useful product in urban areas. The result was a new way of measuring impervious area that was uniform throughout the United States. An updated data set based on similar methodology was released for 2006 (NOAA Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP)). The Washington State Department of Ecology makes these data available on their website (WA Department of Ecology, 2011). The updated data set calibrates well with previous estimates from 2000 (TRPC, 2001), with only a 0.8 percent difference county-wide, despite differences in source data and methodology. A comparison of both data sets is shown in  "}, {"section_title": "B. Accuracy Assessment", "text": "The TRPC land cover has an overall accuracy assessment of 94 percent (TRPC, 2001).

Residential Impervious Surface Ratios for Thurston County", "text": "Relationships between residential units (urban and rural) and total impervious area (TIA) were updated by comparing fully built lots in Thurston County against the 2006 impervious surface GIS data layer.

This is reflective of net density. \u2022 Apartments/condominiums. These are residential units in multifamily buildings, on lots that may include parking lots, stormwater facilities, and communal landscaping. Density was adjusted to reflect net density -to be comparable with other data sets. \u2022 Subdivision. Subdivision boundaries reflect a gross density, and include open space tracts, storm water facilities, and local roads. Densities were adjusted to net density to be comparable to other data sets.

Estimates of Future Impervious -2035 and Buildout", "text": "Forecasts of population and employment provide key information on where land conversion from vegetation to impervious surfaces is likely to occur. Estimates of future impervious area were developed for two time horizons: \u2022 2035 -a 20 year planning horizon commonly used under the Growth Management Act, and \u2022 Buildout -an analysis of Thurston County and City land use when local comprehensive and zoning plans are fully implemented (Table 5). Estimates were derived using the following assumptions: \u2022 Impervious surface in 2010 will not be reduced in the future \u2022 Fully built lots will not increase in impervious area over time. \u2022 Vacant lots and the vacant portions of partially-developed lots will increase in impervious area, proportionate to planned zoning density. \u2022 Timing of development of residential lands is based on the adopted population forecast. \u2022 Timing of development of commercial, industrial, and institutional lands is based on the broad assumption of fifty percent by 2035. \u2022 Future density is determined based on the Buildable Lands Assumptions (TRPC, 2007b).

FOREST CANOPY COVER AND FOREST LANDS VULNERABLE TO URBANIZATION", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "A. Historic Estimates of Forest Canopy Cover", "text": "The Multi-Resolution Land Characterization (MRLC) 2001 program also developed estimates of forest canopy cover as part of the National Land Cover database. Estimates are provided for the years: These estimates provide snapshots in time of forest canopy. Overall, Thurston County has increased forest canopy between 1991 and 2006, with the lowest period in 2001 (Table 9.) Much of the fluctuation can be attributed to the forest harvest cycle and the reforestation of the Centralia Coal Mine (in Skookumchuck River Watershed).

Estimates of Forest Lands Vulnerable to Urban Conversion", "text": "Forest Lands are our working forest lands. They include: \u2022 Public Forests such as Capitol Forest. \u2022 Private Forest Lands enrolled in the Open Space Forest Tax Program. This program provides landowners the option of having their land valued at \"current use\" rather than \"highest and best use.\" As a result, their taxes are lowered if their properties are accepted into the program. This program is an incentive for conservation, but is not designed to protect farmlands in perpetuity. Forest lands should not be confused with forest canopy cover. Forest land is an ownership and use designation, while forest cover is usually a direct measure (through air photos or satellite date) of tree canopy. Private forest lands are vulnerable to conversion to urban uses. A TRPC (TRPC, 2002) indicated that approximately 18,600 acres of forested lands were converted to urban uses between 1985 and 2000, a rate of approximately 1,200 acre per year.     Thurston County is expected to grow by approximately 150,000 people in the next 25 years. Accommodating these people will require will require roughly 70,000 housing units. How these housing units are accommodated can make a tremendous difference on the amount of new imperious area in the County. Numerous studies have shown that limiting basin-wide total impervious area to under 10 percent is essential to maintaining high stream basin biologic integrity. It is counter-intuitive, but compact growth -or growth at higher densities, is friendlier to the environment than sprawl or even some categories of rural growth. Table 12 shows that accommodating dwelling units at urban densities -above 4 units per acre -produces significantly less total impervious area than the same amount of dwelling constructed at lower densities -or below 1 unit per acre. Typical neighborhood densities are as follows: \u2022 Five acre lots are typical in rural Thurston County. \u2022 One acre lots were common in the 1970s, but now are considered urban sprawl. They are found in older suburban neighborhoods. \u2022 Four units per acre is typical of new suburban subdivisions in Thurston County. \u2022 Eight dwellings per acre is typical of traditional urban neighborhoods such as those on the Eastside and Westside of Olympia, with a mixture of single-family, duplexes, and town homes. \u2022 Thirty dwelling units per acre are typical condominiums or townhouse type apartments. \u2022 One hundred units per acre is typically urban apartments or condos with limited parking, such as the Boardwalk apartments in downtown Olympia. Estimates of Current and Future Impervious Area and Vulnerable Forest Lands -34 Both the population forecast and estimates of buildout -or the culmination of adopted land use plans -are based on zoning and development regulations that are in place today. Local Comprehensive Plans are due to be updated by 2014 under the Growth Management Act. As the community examines issues related to growth and planning, the ability to forecast future impervious area conditions based on alternatives to the current plans is an important tool for policy makers and staff.
