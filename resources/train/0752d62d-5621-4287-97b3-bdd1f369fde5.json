[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared a global emergency for a pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. This virus belongs to the Coronaviridae family, which commonly infects humans and mammals, and is an enveloped, non-segmented, positivesense RNA. This family of viruses has caused two previous epidemics: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infections [1, 2] .\nAlthough these viruses belong to the same family, they rely on different mechanisms and have different manifestations in the human host. The newly emerged virus was first detected in Wuhan, China, and as of April 4, 2020, it had infected more than 1 million people worldwide and caused the deaths of 58,937 individuals [3] .\nTo slow the spread of the virus and to contain the infection, countries across the globe are attempting to screen millions of individuals, including all health care personnel and their contacts, patients who have symptoms associated with infection by SARS-CoV-2 and their contacts, individuals who have come into contact with an infected patient, and asymptomatic individuals. People who carry the virus without showing any symptoms pose a major silent threat to public health because they are unknowingly spreading the virus. However, not all countries, hospitals, or laboratories have access to testing kits or to the reagents and supplies that are currently in high demand with which they could make their own kits. In addition, many hospitals and diagnostic laboratories are struggling with an overwhelming number of samples that have been collected but still require testing. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to develop and validate two inexpensive assays to detect SARS-CoV-2 in patient samples in almost any laboratory or hospital in a timely manner and without commercial, ready-made extraction or detection kits. Both assays can use a TRI reagent-based RNA extraction or heat-processed samples for RNA extraction. The RNA extraction procedure is followed by cDNA synthesis then a SYBR Green-based RT-PCR or conventional PCR assay that requires only basic science techniques and equipment. Here we provide two validated protocols for safely detecting SARS-CoV-2 in a conventional biosafety level 2 laboratories within a limited budget by using these easily performed assays."}, {"section_title": "Sample collection and ethical considerations", "text": "This study was performed in compliance with all applicable national and international ethical guidelines for conducting research on human participants, including in accordance with The Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki), and was approved by the institutional review board at King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre IRB # 2200021.

The tests can be conducted using equipment and reagents already found in most pathology or diagnostic laboratories.\nThe heat-processed RNA extraction procedure showed promising results. This finding is in agreement with a recent study that used this approach with various temperatures and times (5 min at 95 \u00b0C; 10 min at 95 \u00b0C; 5 min at 98 \u00b0C; 10 min at 98 \u00b0C) [5] . The present study found that the optimum temperature for robust results was 95 \u00b0C for 15 min. It is important to note that short amplicon sequences are critical for successful detection using heat-processed samples because it is the heat that shears the RNA.\nTesting with RT-PCR has been considered the gold standard for diagnosing COVID-19, with infected individuals identified by the successful amplification of the viral genome obtained using nasopharyngeal swabs. However, recent studies have stated some concerns regarding the specificity of the RT-PCR tests for patients with COVID-19 [6] . Indeed, inaccurate results, especially a false-negative, have dire implications for subsequent community transmission of the virus [7] . Therefore, the inclusion of two SARS-CoV-2 genes for accurate detection has been advised [8] . In the present study, we designed sets of primers that target the E and RdRp genes of the virus. SYBR Green quantitative PCR is widely used because of the ease in assay design and its relatively low setup and running costs. Unlike TaqMan fluorescent probes, SYBR Green dye intercalates into double-stranded DNA to monitor the amplification of the target gene specifically initiated by gene-specific primers [9] . However, one drawback of the SYBR Green assay is that the dye is nonspecific, and this lack of specificity can generate false-positive signals if nonspecific products or primer-dimers are present in the sample. However, including a melting curve analysis at the end of each PCR assay to determine the specificity and efficiency of each RT-PCR reaction will ensure the accuracy of the results when multiple peaks or primer-dimers are not observed. Another potential drawback of the SYBR Green assay is that the length of the amplicon may affect the intensity of the amplification; thus, the present study designed primers for an amplicon less than 120 base pairs. The World Health Organization and Pan American Health Organization published a recommendation for general procedures for inactivation of potentially infectious samples with Ebola virus and other highly pathogenic viral agents, indicating that using TRI reagent offers .

This is because TRI reagent has been shown to denature and destabilize the viral envelope and eliminate cellular nucleases while maintaining the structure of RNA for subsequent analyses.\nThe total cost for the SYBR Green assay was estimated to be $21, and the cost for the PCR was estimated to be $16. Although the PCR assay was more cost effective than the SYBR Green quantitative RT-PCR assay, PRC is more laborious and requires a longer time to complete (approximately 7 hours) than the SYBR Green assay, which requires approximately 4 hours. The time is longer for both techniques than that for using a commercially available detection kit because the two assays developed here are conducted manually. However, the cost for any commercial kit is considerably higher. Of the two manually conducted assay options we developed and validated for detecting SARS-CoV-2, we believe that the SYBR Green assay using RT-PCR is the more favorable choice owing to its potential power in the field of virology, the speed of conducting the assay, and real-time data analysis. The PCR assay was developed and validated as an alternative approach in the event that a laboratory does not have an RT-PCR instrument [11] .\nIn conclusion, we developed and validated two low-cost assays for detecting SARS-CoV-2 that can be used by laboratories that cannot afford or cannot obtain commercial testing kits. Heating samples and using SYBR-Green or PCR assays might be not the ultimate solution for sensitive and accurate diagnoses; however, at a time when SARS-CoV-2 is globally pervasive and deadly and commercial kits are limited, these assays offer viable alternative testing approaches. In addition, these protocols provide virus testing platforms for future threats because the only change that would be required to follow the same protocols to test for a different virus would be the pathogen sequence needed to design specific primers. Furthermore, the protocols have been approved by the Saudi Food and Drug Administration as Emergency Use Authorization for use in a clinical setting.\n.
