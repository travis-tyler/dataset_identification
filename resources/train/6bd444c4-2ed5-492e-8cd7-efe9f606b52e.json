[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The COVID-19 is a major threat worldwide, which lacks effective medication 1 . Moreover, the understanding of mechanisms of anti-virus immunity is limited 2 . COVID-19 genome sequence homology with SARS-CoV is 77% and has the potential to become a seasonal disease 3 . COVID-19 is a troubling disease with the feature of high infection rate, long incubation period, and atypical symptoms 4 . The world is not prepared for the pandemic and more infections have appeared in the second phase of the outbreak 5, 6 . Thus, the rapid development and administration of vaccines and drugs are of great importance to quell this pandemic.\nThe COVID-19 is an RNA virus with spike-like glycoproteins 7 . The major structural proteins of coronaviruses are spike protein, envelope protein, membrane protein, and nucleocapsid protein 8 . Based on these structures, DNA/RNA vaccines in situ inside the patient should be considered 9 . Modern virology and antiviral drug discovery are expected to be principal by analyzing genomics methods 10 . The future challenge is to determine which gene products are essential for virus survival or disease progression 11 . Thus, exploring the unique characteristics belonging to COVID-19 is principal in developing therapies to improve patient outcomes.\nA great number of strategies have been taken to explore the molecular characteristics of COVID-19 12 . High-throughput microarray methodologies and advanced drug development including remdesivir and acyclovir have drawn extensive attentions 13 .\nMoreover, multiple gene expression profiling studies on COVID-19 have been performed by using microarray technology 14 . However, due to the shortcomings of microarray such as limited sample size, deficiency of information, and measurement issue, the understanding of key pathogenesis of COVID-19 becomes a major challenge 15 .\nIn this study, we analyzed the GEO data (GSE152075), provided by Lieberman N and Greninger A (University of Washington), from the Gene Expression Omnibus database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) to identify DEGs and the relevant biological process of COVID-19 utilizing comprehensive bioinformatics analysis. The functional enrichment, pathway analysis, and protein-protein interaction were performed for finding key gene nodes."}, {"section_title": "Data resources", "text": "Gene expression profile dataset GSE152075 was obtained from the GEO database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/).

Our study analyzed five positive samples (GSM4602241, GSM4602242, GSM4602243, GSM4602244, GSM4602245) and five negative control samples (GSM4602672, GSM4602673, GSM4602674, GSM4602675, GSM4602676)."}, {"section_title": "Data acquisition and preprocessing", "text": "The raw microarray data files between SARS-CoV2 positive samples and negative controls were subsequently conducted by R script. We used a classical t test to identify DEGs with P<.05 and fold change \u22651.5 as being statistically significant.\nGene ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analysis of DEGs Gene ontology (GO) analysis is a widely used approach to annotate genomic data and identify characteristic biological information. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database is commonly used for systematic analysis of gene functions and annotation of biological pathways. GO analysis and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of DEGs in our study were analyzed by the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) (http://david.ncifcrf.gov/) online tools.\nP<.05 and gene counts >10 were considered statistically significant."}, {"section_title": "Module analysis", "text": "The Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE) was used to detect densely connected regions in PPI networks. The significant modules were from the constructed PPI network using MCODE. the functional and pathway enrichment analyses were performed using Reactome Pathway Database (https://reactome.org/).\nThe top two significant modules of COVID-19 versus control samples were selected to analyze the functional annotation of the genes (Figure 2 ). We then analyzed the functional genes by using Reactome Pathway Database (https://reactome.org/). We identified top 10 significant pathways including \"Anchoring of the basal body to the plasma membrane\", \"Cilium Assembly\" , \" Organelle biogenesis and maintenance\" , \"Loss of Nlp from mitotic centrosomes\", \"Loss of proteins required for interphase microtubule organization from the centrosome\", \"AURKA Activation by TPX2\", \"Recruitment of mitotic centrosome proteins and complexes\", \"Centrosome maturation\", \"Regulation of PLK1 Activity at G2/M Transition\" and \"Recruitment of NuMA to mitotic centrosomes\" in Supplemental table S1."}, {"section_title": "Identification of DEGs in COVID-19 patients", "text": "To gather further insights on host responses to COVID-19 infection, the modular transcriptional signature of COVID-19 patients was compared to that of negative controls. "}, {"section_title": "Enrichment analysis of DEGs in COVID-19 patients", "text": "To further analyze the biological roles of the DEGs from negative controls versus COVID-19 positive samples, we performed KEGG pathway and GO categories enrichment analysis. KEGG pathways (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/) is an encyclopedia of genes and genomes, which was used to define the functional meanings to genes and genomes both at the molecular and higher levels 16 . In our study, the top enriched biological pathways associated with COVID-19 included \"Biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids\", \"Fatty acid elongation\", \"ABC transporters\", \"Lysosome\", \"Vasopressin-regulated water reabsorption\", \"RNA degradation\" and \"Fatty acid metabolism\" (Figure 1 ).\nGene ontology (GO) analysis provides defined GO terms to genes, which covers cellular components, molecular functions, and biological processes 17 . We herein identified top 10 cellular components: \"axonemal dynein complex\", \"nuclear exosome (RNase complex)\", \"SCF ubiquitin ligase complex\", \"axoneme\", \"centrosome\", \"intracellular membranebounded organelle\", \"Golgi apparatus\", \"membrane\", \"cytosol\" and \"cytoplasm\" (Figure 1 ).\nWe also identified top 10 molecular functions: \"protein kinase A regulatory subunit binding\", \"3'-5'-exoribonuclease activity\", \"translation initiation factor activity\", \"ATPase activity (transmembrane movement)\", \"helicase activity\", \"ATP-dependent RNA helicase activity\", \"ATPase activity\", \"catalytic activity\", \"cadherin binding involved in cell-cell adhesion\", \"ATP binding\" (Figure 1 ). We then identified top 10 biological processes:\n\"glycerolipid metabolic process\", \"inner dynein arm assembly\", \"cilium movement\", \"exonucleolytic nuclear-transcribed mRNA catabolic process involved in deadenylationdependent decay\", \"regulation of translational initiation\", \"RNA secondary structure unwinding\", \"cilium assembly\", \"cilium morphogenesis\", \"protein transport\" and \"positive regulation of GTPase activity\" (Figure 1 )."}, {"section_title": "PPI network analysis of DEGs", "text": "To further explore the relationships of GGEs at the protein level, the PPI networks were constructed by using the Cytoscape software. We set the predefined criterion of combined score >0.7, a total of 2858 interactions and 1248 nodes were created to form the PPI network between negative controls and COVID-19 positive samples. Among these nodes, the top 10 hub genes with highest degree scores are shown in Table 2 ."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The COVID-19 has had profound economic and public health impact globally 18 .\nUnderstanding the pathogenesis of COVID-19 is critical for diagnosis and drug development. The high-throughput sequencing provides thousands of gene information which can be used to predict the potential therapeutic targets 19 .\nCOVID-19 has great impact on metabolic syndrome according to our analysis of KEGG pathways. The results showed six in ten most enriched pathways are involved in the regulation of fatty-related metabolism such as \"Biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids\", \"fatty acid elongation\", \"ABC transporters\", \"Fatty acid metabolism\", \"Metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450\" and \"Metabolic pathways\". Many patients with COVID-19 have related to metabolic syndrome. In a study conducted in the U.S., 12% of the 1482 patients with COVID-19 had history of comorbidities. Of this total, 48.3% were obese, 28.3% were diabetics and 27.8% were cardiovascular disease 20 . In this scenario, the relationship between metabolic syndrome and COVID-19 cannot be ignored. Our analysis showed COVID-19 mainly affects fatty acid synthesis, processing, and decomposition process. Similarly, Tiffany Thomas et al found the COVID-19 could alter the fatty acid metabolism consistent with altered carbon homeostasis 21 . Thus, we believed that the high mortality rate of patients with basic metabolic diseases/COVID-19 is due to that COVID-19 changed the metabolic process of fatty acids. We also believe that the simultaneous administration of drugs that regulate fatty acid metabolism during the treatment of COVID-19 may accelerate the recovery of patients.\nBesides regulating metabolism such as ATPase activity, COVID-19 is involved in cilium activity. The GO analysis showed \"Cilium movement\", \"Cilium assembly\" and \"Cilium morphogenesis\" play important roles in COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 causes lung infection with loss of smell, which recently has been considered as a specific symptom.\nSimilarly, the correlation between the COVID-19 and chemosensory dysfunction was reported, suggesting that loss of smell or taste may be considered as subclinical markers 22, 23 . Numerous odorant receptors locate on sensory cilia, perceive odorants, and transduce the signal to brain. Primary cilia also perceive various environmental stimuli and regulate cell functions 24, 25 . Moreover, the latest pathological studies found the expression of SARS-CoV-2 antigens in the ciliated nasal epithelial cells 26, 27 . Moreover, TEM studies detected the short cilia and smell restoration in patients with COVID-19.\nTEM studies also provide evidence that cilia can be the absorption site or entry site for viral infection 28, 29 . Thus, our results further confirmed that COVID-19 could affect the cilia system to promote the entry. It is suggested that cilia regeneration therapy may be a new direction for COVID-19 infection.\nThe subsequent construction of the PPI network identified 10 DEGs as potential key genes involved in COVID-19. Elongin C (ELOC), which is a critical part binds to the \"BCbox motif\" in the VHL-box and SOCS-box protein families. The immunodeficiency virus (FIV) protein interacts with Cullin (CUL), Elongin B (ELOB), and Elongin C (ELOC) to form an E3 ubiquitination complex to induce the degradation of feline A3s 30 . This suggests that Elongin C is critical for virus binding and functions. Cytoplasmic dynein 1 (DYNLL1), acts as a motor for the intracellular retrograde motility of vesicles and organelles along microtubules, is also reported to enhance the intracellular transport of porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) 31 . Circadian clocks control the processes of diseases such as inflammation, aging, virus replication and the severity of infections [32] [33] [34] . FBXL3 is reported to bind to a core circadian protein cryptochrome 2 (Cry2) to promote its degradation. Thus, FBXL3 could change the circadian rhythms in COVID-19 patients. FBXW11 (F-Box And WD Repeat Domain Containing 11) is a protein associated with diseases include digital syndrome and non-specific syndromic intellectual disability 35 . Recently, a major virulence factor NSs was found to interact with FBXW11 36 . Moreover, module analysis of the PPI network of COVID-19 suggested that the development and progression of COVID-19 were related to the cilium assembly. The genes such as AHI1, AHI1, AKAP9, B9D1, C2CD3, CEP135, CEP164, CEP290, CEP41 are involved in basal body and cilium construction after analysis by String.\nIn conclusion, FLOC, DYNLL1, FBXL3 and FBXW11 may be the key genes for COVID-19. Furthermore, the results suggested that several biological pathways such as \"fatty-related metabolism\", \"Cilium movement\", \"Cilium assembly\" and \"Cilium morphogenesis\" are commonly involved in the development of COVID-19. This study thus provides further insights into the underlying pathogenesis of COVID-19, which may facilitate the diagnosis and drug development. "}]
