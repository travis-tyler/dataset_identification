The major purpose of this 1998 report is to provide information useful for monitoring the GRT program. Data will also be useful for measuring achievement toward NSF's Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) Outcome Goal Number Three: creating a diverse, globally oriented workforce of scientists and engineers. The following are some of the findings drawn from analysis of the 1998 reporting year data. Enrollment. Minority enrollment in the GRT program was stable, decreasing only from 12 to 11 percent, between the 1997 and 1998 reporting years. Between those same years, the percentage of female trainees also decreased only slightly from 38 to 37 percent. The percentage of disabled trainees in those two reporting years remained the same, at 1 percent. The percentage of minority trainees in 1998 varied only slightly among the various cohorts, from a high of 16 percent (1994) to a low of 9 percent (1992 and 1995). GRT shows that the percentage of women participating in the GRT program (37 percent) was lower than the percentage of women graduate students in science and engineering overall in the country (43 percent). Data from the same sources show that the overall rates of participation of GRT trainees and GSS respondents by race/ethnicity group varied by no more than 2 percent. Project Features to Support Trainees' Educational Experiences. The percentage of GRT projects that reported efforts to recruit minority and female trainees increased over the reporting period. In the 1997 reporting year, 41 percent of projects reported using various strategies to recruit these groups. In 1998, about 38 percent reported visiting minority-serving institutions or women's colleges to recruit trainees, and 50 percent made some other effort to recruit trainees from underrepresented groups. Projects placed increased emphasis on international opportunities for their trainees; 59 percent of projects reported such opportunities in 1998, compared to 38 percent in 1997. In vi Program Outcomes addition, initiatives to prepare their trainees for faculty positions were reported by 85 percent of projects in 1998, an increase from 54 percent in 1997. Trainee Ph.D. Completion and Subsequent Employment. The cumulative percentage of GRT trainees who had completed their Ph.D.s by the 1998 reporting period was about 12 percent, almost double the cumulative completion rate reported in 1997. Completion rates were similar for males and females, but higher for nonminorities than for minorities (13 percent and 4 percent, respectively). This gap in cumulative completion rates between minority and nonminority trainees increased between 1997 and 1998. Overall, the cumulative percentage of GRT trainees requiring 4 years or less to complete their Ph.D.s increased since the 1997 reporting year. In 1998, 21 percent of GRT trainees who had completed their Ph.D.s took 4 years or less to do so, compared to 12 percent in the 1997 reporting year.' On the other hand, the cumulative percentage of trainees who took 7 or more years to complete their Ph.D.s increased from 3 to 19 percent. The average time to complete the GRT Ph.D. (5.5 years) did not vary by gender or minority status. Almost half of the 194 trainees who completed a GRT-supported Ph.D. program by the 1998 reporting year were in postdoctoral positions. Most of the others were employed as educators or by private organizations."}, {"section_title": "Attrition and Employment of Trainees Who Left GRT", "text": "Program Prior to Obtaining Ph.D. The cumulative percentage of GRT trainees by 1998 who had stopped their pursuit of a Ph.D. was 18 percent overall, an increase from the 10 percent rate in 1997. Minority students had a higher cumulative attrition rate than nonminority students (24 percent compared to 17 percent) in 1998. The most common reason for leaving the GRT program was to pursue employment; more than half of the Engineering and Computer and Information Sciences and Engineering trainees who left the program did so to pursue employment. The 1998 data showed that trainees who left the GRT program before Ph.D. completion were most likely to be employed in the private sector (39 percent). Most of the others were in graduate school either at the GRT institution or elsewhere, or employed in the public sector or an academic setting. The average time that students receive GRT funding is less than the number of years required to complete a Ph.D."}, {"section_title": "vii", "text": "GRT Course Features. Projects continued to develop courses and/or curricula that will remain with the GRT-funded department after the GRT project has ended. A total of 316 new courses, other institutional offerings, or course requirements were developed by the 157 GRT projects during the 1998 reporting year alone. These institutional outcomes are in addition to the 1,061 that had already been reported during the 1997 reporting year for all years of project operation prior to the 1998 reporting year. As more trainees complete their Ph.D. programs, subsequent years of GRT trend data should provide additional useful information about subsequent employment in the workforce. Along with related analyses, such data should contribute to NSF's assessment of the GRT program investment and of related agency endeavors, in support of postdoctoral activities. Finally, in addition to this report on outcomes of the GRT Program, Abt Associates has prepared a report based on site visits to selected GRT projects.

Simultaneously, research both within and outside of SMET fields is contributing to a refinement of strategies that promise to improve education for SMET professions generally, while also holding special promise for the retention of individuals from groups that are currently underrepresented in these fields. The National Science Foundation (NSF) has positioned itself at the forefront of these activities with the development of agencywide outcome goals that were established in response to the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 1993. NSF's GPRA Outcome Goal Number Three for FY 99 was to create a diverse, globally oriented workforce of scientists and engineers.' Indicators measuring success for this goal are that 1) participants in NSF activities experience world-class professional practices in research and education, using modern technologies and incorporating international points of reference, and 2) the science and engineering workforce reflects increased participation of women, minorities, and persons with disabilities in fields where their participation traditionally is low. One NSF program that addresses Goal Three is the Graduate Research Traineeship (GRT) program, which funds projects that support the research and education of talented students pursuing graduate degrees in critical and emerging areas of SMET and SMET education. NSF-awarded institutions select which students receive traineeships, determine the length of traineeship positions, and enhance the trainees' graduate education experiences through the development of various project features."}, {"section_title": "GRT Distance Monitoring Survey", "text": "GRT programmatic funds have been awarded to four groups or \"cohorts\" of projects: 1992projects: , 1993projects: , 1994projects: , and 1995 Descriptive Outcomes report presents selected quantitative and descriptive findings from the 1998 survey of the GRT program. The major purpose of this analysis is to provide information useful for project monitoring and evaluation, and for measuring achievement of NSF's GPRA Outcome Goal Number Three. The GRT Distance Monitoring Survey was initiated in 1997 to collect annual quantitative and qualitative data about the projects via the World Wide Web. Projects annually report information about personnel (including trainee characteristics and achievements), project features (such as recruitment strategies), and institutional impact. In 1997, GRT projects reported activities and accomplishments dating from the first year in which NSF funding was received through June 1997. The 1997 data collection provided a comprehensive snapshot of the program from 1992 to 1997? Thus, in 1998, the second survey, GRT projects reported information about activities for just one academic year. This reporting of annual data initiated the possibility of conducting analyses examining how the GRT program is evolving on a year-to-year basis. The 1998 survey requested clarification on several previously collected data items in order to facilitate quantitative and trend analysis. For example, data on specific GRT project features, such as multidisciplinary training, were collected in a simple \"yes/no\" check-off format in the 1997 survey. In 1998, for each project feature, the survey presented a detailed checklist of specific approaches that might have been used, along with places to indicate whether such activities predated and/or were developed with the NSF funding. Due to such slight differences between the two reporting years, some items in this brief are being reported for the first time as baseline, rather than trend, data. These few instances of new baseline data are clearly indicated by table titles and textual explanations."}, {"section_title": "2", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "IMPLEMENTATION OF", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "THE GRT PROGRAM Participation in GRT Program", "text": "Many of the tables in this brief reflect the four cohorts of GRT proposals that were approved in 1992, 1993, 1994, and 1995. The 1992 cohort projects received standard grants, i.e., all 5 years of funding were provided at the time of award, while cohorts after 1992 received funding through continuing grants, i.e., incremental funding. Participating graduate students receive GRT traineeship support from a funded project, but trainee participation does not usually coincide with all the years for which a particular project is funded. The 1995 cohort was the last group of projects to be implemented under the GRT program; GRT has been succeeded by the Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training (IGERT) program, which made its first awards in 1998. By FY 1996, the GRT program had made 157 awards to 92 postsecondary institutions. These 157 projects in turn had provided traineeships to 1,595 doctoral students by the end of the 1998 reporting period, an increase of 284 from the 1,311 trainees reported in the 1997 data (Table 1). This increase in the total number of trainees who were ever funded by GRT resulted largely from the replacement of the 280 trainees who had left their Ph.D. programs with newly funded trainees.

Percentages of female and minority trainees were similar in both reporting periods! The data showing trainee characteristics by award cohort suggest that efforts to recruit minority students into the GRT program were slightly more successful for the 1993 and 1994 cohorts (Appendix Table A-2). The percentage of minority trainees rose from about 9 percent in the 1992 cohort to 12 percent in the 1993 cohort and 16 percent in the 1994 cohort, dropping again to 9 percent for the 1995 cohort. Projects reported that overall, just 1 percent of trainees were disabled, which was the case across all cohorts. However, for 18 percent of trainees, disability status was not reported.

As shown in Appendix Table A-8, female GRT trainees in two broad focus areas exceeded the national rate for female graduate students: 8 percent more in Engineering, and 5 percent more in Geosciences. On the other hand, nationally, women in Biological Sciences, Computer and Information Sciences and Engineering, and Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences, composed, respectively, 3, 5, and 15 percent more of the graduate student population than they did of GRT trainees in those fields. Race/Ethnicity. Comparison of GRT data on race/ethnicity of trainees from reporting year 1998 with those from the GSS survey for 1995 and 1997 show that the percentages of trainees in each group were very close to those reported by the GSS survey (see Table 6).

In order to mirror the categories in which student data are collected by GSS, it is necessary to combine Asian and Pacific Islander data for GRT trainees. This combination makes it impossible to use GSS data as a baseline for assessing the GRT program's progress in promoting involvement of Pacific Islanders in SMET. These data are shown by broad focus area in Table A-9. Table 6 Comparisons of GRT trainee participation with national graduate student enrollment, by However, programs did provide narrative data about recruitment in 1997, permitting limited comparisons between the 1997 narrative data and the 1998 quantitative data. Overall, the 1998 data indicate that 90 percent of the GRT projects used one or more strategies to recruit trainees for the GRT program (Appendix Table A -10). Only the 1992 award cohort had fewer than 90 percent of its projects (79 percent) reporting one or more GRT recruitment strategies. Comparison of the 1997 narrative data and 1998 quantitative data suggests that more programs were using each of these strategies in 1998 than they were in 1997.5 For example, the Baseline Report indicated that in 1997, less than half of projects used brochures, posters, and other program announcements. About one-third reported using advertisements in scholarly publications, web pages, electronic bulletin boards, and e-mail lists in 1997, and only 10 percent used GRT funds to bring prospective trainees to visit the program. During the 1998 data collection period, projects were asked whether each strategy was developed by GRT (as opposed to already being in use by the department or institution). In response, the majority (generally two-thirds or more) reported the strategies were developed by the GRT project. Over 80 percent of those projects that placed ads in scholarly journals or electronic media and promoted GRT at national meetings and/or graduate student fairs reported that these strategies had been developed as a result of"}, {"section_title": "GRT.", "text": "Recruitment of Individuals from Underrepresented Groups.

The most frequently cited strategies included: Sending promotional mailings (including e-mail) to institutions with high minority enrollment, or to mailing lists (e-mail and postal) of minority students; Contacting and visiting faculty and students at women's colleges and historically black colleges and universities; Recruiting minority and female undergraduates or graduate students enrolled in the same department in their own universities; and Promoting GRT at national meetings and conferences, in advertisements in professional publications, and through national societies for women and/or minorities in the sciences. Three projects reported establishing \"pipeline\" programs that link minority undergraduates to their doctoral programs. One such project is developing a \"feeder school\" program that will eventually include faculty exchanges for lectures, seminars, and workshops, cooperative research projects and instructional activities, sharing of research facilities, and linking GRT trainees and prospective students by electronic mentoring and \"virtual\" supervision of undergraduate research projects. Using the Internet for Recruitment. Projects provided supporting text data about recruitment strategies using the Internet in the 1998 Distance Monitoring System.' Analysis of these data indicates that the Internet is a popular recruitment tool. The most common uses of the Internet were advertising the GRT traineeships on web sites, electronic bulletin boards, listserves, and newsgroups. Many projects used their university or departmental web site to provide detailed information about their GRT traineeships as well as research activities, faculty, and coursework. Two projects reported that their GRT trainees are responsible for developing web sites for their programs. One of those projects, at a public university, asked their trainees to maintain portfolios of their progress through the entire year and to develop those portfolios into web pages. This project plans to link these web-based portfolios to the department web site as a means of conveying to prospective students what sorts of activities and opportunities might be available to them."}, {"section_title": "' .", "text": "During the 1997 data collection, projects were not specifically asked to address whether their recruitment strategies used the Internet."}, {"section_title": "13", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "GRT Project Features", "text": "One of the GRT program's objectives is to \"stimulate the development of graduate training environments that simultaneously address areas of national science and technology priority and proactively build an infrastructure capable of promoting and sustaining student diversity\" (NSF GRT 1995 Program Announcement, NSF 94-140). The 1998 data8 indicate that GRT grantees have made considerable efforts to increase their offerings of innovative educational experiences for their trainees. Table 7 shows the percentage of projects reporting specific project features in the 1997 and 1998 reporting periods. The data also indicate a trend in which these Project features were provided by more projects over time. Thus, in each subsequent award year, GRT projects have increased the range of educational experiences made available to their students in order to supplement the more typical research opportunities traditionally afforded by most NSF grant funding. Appendix Table  A-11 presents these data by award cohort, providing details about specific activities undertaken, as well as the percentage of those activities developed by GRT. The quantitative 1997 data on project features are limited to the percentage of projects reporting use of specific features. A higher percentage of projects reported international opportunities and initiatives to prepare trainees for faculty positions in the 1998 reporting period than did so in 1997 (Table 7). However, multidisciplinary training activities were offered by a slightly higher percentage of projects in the 1997 reporting period than in the 1998 reporting period. Providing instruction and other academic support by faculty from multiple departments (73 percent overall); Offering multidisciplinary courses (66 percent overall); and Providing traineeships to students from various departments (54 percent overall). Analysis of text data provided by GRT projects indicates that the projects strongly support the goal of multidisciplinary training and have developed training features to achieve that goal for their students. In addition to those activities listed above, many departments described activities such as lab rotations or research projects in other departments, multidisciplinary field projects and seminars, and interdisciplinary advising and thesis committees. Private/Public Sector Opportunities. Overall, about 66 percent of projects reported in 1998 that they had offered private/public sector opportunities to their trainees, and more than half of these opportunities were developed by GRT. Again, an increasing percentage of grantees developed these activities in each successive cohort. Half of the cohort offered such opportunities, compared to three-quarters in the 1995 cohort (Appendix Table A Projects offered a myriad of other opportunities for trainees to gain exposure to and experience with employment options in their field. In addition to internships, some programs encouraged students to work for or under contract to industrial and/or government laboratory researchers during their traineeships. Others had affiliated faculty from industry as partners. Several projects developed special training, workshops, or colloquia with industry partners. For example, one project described an Applied Mathematics in Industry Workshop in which industrial researchers presented problems, then faculty, postdoctoral, and student teams worked for a week to develop solutions. At the end, trainees made oral presentations and wrote papers about the problem and potential solutions. International Opportunities. Overall, 59 percent of the projects reported in 1998 that they had used international activities to enhance their trainees' educational experiences (Appendix Table   A -11). Projects appear to be placing increased emphasis on offering such opportunities; only 38 percent of projects reported them in the 1997 reporting year. As with the other project features, the percentage of projects that reported having offered these opportunities was higher for each successive cohort. One example of the type of rich opportunities GRT projects offered their trainees was a research trip to Costa Rico for students to learn about conservation and biodiversity in the tropics, the most species rich environments in the world; to see how human activities such as urbanization, farming, and logging are affecting habitats, biodiversity, and ecosystem processes; and to introduce them to people and projects engaged in exemplary conservation projects. After initial visits to a variety of sites in the country, students and faculty split into a marine and a terrestrial team, each of which undertook a research project. Initiatives to Prepare Trainees for Faculty Positions. Overall, 85 percent of projects reported initiatives to prepare trainees for faculty positions in 1998, compared to 54 percent in 1997. The 1994 and 1995 cohorts placed considerable emphasis on these activities; over 97 percent of those grantees engaged in such activities (Appendix Table A -11). It appears, however, that many grantees offered these activities before GRT funding; for most activities, less than 50 percent were developed by GRT. The most common activities included: Trainees serving as teaching assistants or mentors to students (69 percent overall); Other Structural Components. Overall, nearly half of the projects reported in 1998 that they had offered \"other structural components\" to enhance their trainees' educational experiences (Appendix Table A -11). These components varied widely, including experiences such as colloquia, workshops, weekly research meetings, and weekend or summer laboratory courses. Consortial Agreements. Consortial arrangements are formal alliances between a GRT project and at least one other organization designed to help GRT projects achieve objectives (e.g., recruit minority students, provide graduate students with training in a specific field) that might otherwise not be accomplished. For the 1998 reporting year, 43 percent of the projects overall reported at least one consortial agreement (Table 8), slightly higher than the 40 percent of projects that reported such agreements in 1997 for the 1992-97 period. The percentage of projects that reported having established consortial agreements with other graduate-degreegranting institutions in order to provide trainees opportunities to engage in special research and training at other institutions was higher in 1998 than in 1997. However  'Combinations or groups formed to undertake an enterprise beyond the resources of any one member. 2Nongraduate institution serves as a feeder school for a GRT project by identifying students for recruiting purposes. 3Consortial arrangements with another graduate-degree-granting institution. Under this arrangement trainees might be provided opportunities to engage in special research and training at lower institutions. \"Arrangements that are specifically designed to increase the pool of minority trainees at GRT projects.   Trainee Achievements. Projects reported in 1998 that about 55 percent of GRT trainees had at least one academic achievement during their years in the GRT program (Appendix Table A-13), essentially the same as the 56 percent for 1997 in the Baseline Report. The most common achievements were presentations and journal articles; very few trainees had patents, books, or book chapters. The percentage of trainees who had at least one achievement increased from 45 percent for the 1992 cohort to 71 percent for the 1995 cohort. This increase, however, may be partly attributable to the difficulty of obtaining citations on achievements from the earlier years of the projects for entry into the monitoring system during the 1997 reporting year. The average number of achievements per trainee in 1998 was 2.2. The average number of achievements per trainee varied considerably by broad focus area. Trainees in Education and Human Resources had the highest number of achievements per trainee (5.0), followed by Biological Sciences (2.5), and Engineering (2.1). Trainee Ph.D. Completion. By 1998, the cumulative percentage of GRT trainees who had completed their Ph.D.s (Table 9) was about 12 percent, almost double the cumulative completion rate by 1997 reported in the Baseline Report. As expected, Ph.D. completion rates decreased for each cohort, from 23 percent of trainees in the 1992 award cohort to 5 percent of trainees in the 1995 award cohort (Appendix Table A-14). Overall, cumulative completion rates in 1998 were similar for male and female trainees (13 percent and 12 percent, respectively), while in 1997, the completion rate for females was about 5 percent compared to 7 percent for males. By 1998, the cumulative percentage of minority 19 r) 8 trainees who had completed their degrees by 1998 was only 4 percent, compared to 13 percent of nonminorities, a difference of percent. In 1997, the difference between the cumulative completion rates for these two groups was only 5 percent. Completion rates also varied by broad focus area. They were highest among trainees in Mathematical and Physical Sciences (17 percent) and BiologiCal Sciences (14 percent), and lowest for trainees enrolled in/Engineering (8 percent) and Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences (7 percent) programs. Overall, the number of years required for GRT trainees to complete their Ph.D.s' has decreased since the 1997 reporting year (Table  10). Appendix Tables A-16 through A-18 present the cumulative number of years required for GRT trainees to complete the GRT Ph.D. by cohort overall, by gender and minority status, and by broad focus area.  Tables A-19 through A-21 show cumulative 1998 data on employment status of GRT trainees who completed their Ph.D.s, by award cohort overall, by gender and minority status, and by broad focus area. The data indicate that almost half of the 194 trainees who completed their GRT Ph.D.s by the 1998 reporting year were in postdoctoral positions. Most of the others were employed as educators (19 percent) or by private organizations (22 9 The average time that students receive GRT funding (15.7 months) is less than the number of years required to complete a Ph.D. (1997 GRT survey data). 21 30, percent). These data were not collected quantitatively in 1997, so comparisons between the reporting years are not possible. Postgraduate employment status did not vary by gender. It did, however, vary by minority status. Minority graduates were more likely to be employed in education or government than were nonminority graduates, but they held no positions in private or other employment. Employment status of GRT graduates also varied by broad focus area. In reporting year 1998, 60 percent of Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences graduates were employed in education, compared to 12 percent each of Engineering and Geosciences graduates (Appendix Table A Trainee Attrition. By 1998, the cumulative percentage of all trainees who discontinued their participation in GRT before attaining a Ph.D. was 18 percent, compared to a cumulative 10 percent in 1997 (Table 11). Attrition rates increased in all broad focus areas, even doubling in Computer and Information Sciences and Engineering, Engineering, and Geosciences. Both the 1997 and 1998 cumulative data indicate that male and female trainees discontinued their GRT study at about the same rate, but minority trainees had a higher attrition rate than nonminority trainees overall, 24 percent for minority trainees and 17 percent for nonminority trainees. Attrition rates were also higher for disabled trainees in the 1998 data (25 percent) than for nondisabled trainees (17 percent). The total number of disabled trainees, 16, was very low, however, so these percentages should be viewed from that perspective.  Overall, men were more likely than women to leave the program to pursue employment (although that was not the case in every cohort). Similarly, nonminorities were more likely than minorities to leave to pursue employment overall, but not in every cohort (Appendix Table A -24). The cumulative 1998 data indicate that the second most common reason for leaving the GRT program was to pursue other academic interests (27 percent). This reason was given by roughly equivalent percentages of men and women and of minorities and nonminorities. However, this reason varied greatly according to broad focus area; 80 percent of Education and Human Resources trainees who left the program did so for this reason, while only 12 percent of Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences trainees who left did so for that reason (Appendix Table A -25). Very few (about 8 percent) trainees left the program due to family or economic problems. Women were twice as likely as men to leave for family or economic problems, and. nonminorities were slightly more likely than minorities to leave for that reason. Overall, only 6 percent of trainees left because they failed to meet program requirements. However, minorities were more likely than nonminorities to fail to meet requirements (14 percent compared to 5 percent). Appendix Tables A-27 and A-28 show employment status of former trainees by gender and minority status and by broad focus area. Males were more likely than females to be employed in the private sector, while females were more likely to be employed in the public sector. Females were also more likely than males to be enrolled in another graduate program at the GRT institution. The number of minority trainees who left the GRT program is very small (ranging from 7 to 16 over the various cohorts), so comparisons between minority and nonminority trainees in these tables should be made in light of this fact. Former trainees enrolled in Computer and Information Science and Engineering, Engineering, and Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences were more likely than former trainees in the other broad focus areas to be employed in the private sector. Small numbers of former trainees in other employment or educational settings prohibit other comparisons between broad focus areas. GRT Course Features. Projects provided information about \"institutional impact,\" defined in the Distance Monitoring System as \"those course and/or curriculum accomplishments that will remain with a department after the GRT project has ended.\" Table   12 provides an overview of new course features attributable to GRT; Appendix Table A-29 presents those data by award cohort. As of the 1997 reporting year, 249 new courses had been developed by all projects from the start of their implementation. During the 1998 reporting year, those projects added another 79 new courses. The projects instituted 145 new requirements for trainees to complete in order to earn a doctorate as of the 1997 reporting year; they added another 42 during the 1998 reporting year. Projects reported 140 new interdepartmental offerings in the 1997 data, and an additional 35 in the 1998 data. Finally, they reported 527 seminars, workshops, and conferences in 1997, and another 130 in 1998. Overall, 28 percent of projects reported developing one or more new courses during the 1998 reporting year (Appendix Table A -30). The percentages of projects that reported at least one new GRT course feature was lowest for the 1992 cohort projects, higher for each of the next two cohorts, then slightly lower for the 1995 cohort. In addition, during the 1998 reporting year, 9 percent of projects had added new course requirements, 17 percent added new interdepartmental offerings, and 39 percent added at least one seminar, workshop, and/or conference resulting from their GRT award. shows that the percentage of women participating in the GRT program (37 percent) was lower than the percentage of women graduate students in science and engineering overall in the country (43 percent)."}, {"section_title": "Summary of Findings", "text": "Comparison of data on race/ethnicity data from the same sources shows that the overall rates of participation of GRT trainees by race/ethnicity group were very close to the percentages reported by the GSS for those same ethnic groups, varying by no more than 2 percent. These data are less precise, however, than the comparisons of data on gender because of the high percentages in both data sources for which race/ethnicity was unknown. Recruitment. Most of the GRT projects (90 percent) used at least one strategy to recruit trainees for the GRT program. About 38 percent reported visiting minority-serving institutions or women's colleges to recruit minority and female trainees; 50 percent made 4st some other effort to recruit trainees from underrepresented groups. This is an increase from the Baseline Report; 41 percent of projects reported using such strategies to recruit these groups in the 1997 reporting year. International Opportunities for Trainees. Employment status was unknown for about one-fifth of former trainees. Most of the others were in graduate school either at the GRT institution or studying elsewhere. GRT Course Features. Projects continued to develop course and/or curriculum accomplishments that will remain with the GRTfunded department after the GRT project has ended. A total of 316 new courses, other institutional offerings, or course requirements were developed by the 157 GRT projects during the 1998 reporting year alone. These institutional outcomes are in addition to the 1,061 that had already been reported during the 1997 reporting year for all years of project operation prior to the 1998 reporting year. Data obtained from the GRT Distance Monitoring Survey System for the 1998 reporting year show some areas of definite progress since the 1997 Baseline Report. In recent years, NSF has increased the emphasis it places on short-term project outcomes. The data for 1998 show that over time, GRT projects have increased the range of project features such as private/public sector opportunities and multidisciplinary training activities provided to improve the educational experiences of trainees. This trend suggests that NSF's efforts to communicate to GRT principal investigators regarding the importance of these educational experiences have been increasingly successful. On the other hand, some trends from the 1998 data, such as the higher attrition rate for minority GRT trainees than for nonminority trainees and the increase in the percentage of trainees who took 7 or more years to complete their Ph.D.s, warrant closer attention in the future. These analyses also raise questions that cannot be answered by the data contained within the monitoring system. For example, the general decrease between 1997 and 1998 reporting years in the number of years required for trainees to complete their GRT-supported Ph.D.s raises the question of whether the trainees' involvement in the GRT program had any influence on that reduction. In the 1999 reporting year, more detailed data have been collected by the Distance Monitoring Survey on race, ethnicity, and disability. As more trainees complete their Ph.D. programs, subsequent years of GRT trend data should provide richer information about trainee Ph.D. completion and subsequent employment. Such data can contribute to the continued refinement of the GRT program and of related agency endeavors.
