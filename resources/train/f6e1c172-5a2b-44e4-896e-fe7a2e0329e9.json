These data take the form of (a) elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin 6 (IL6) in the serum or plasma of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) (Maes, 1999, Howren et al., 2009, Dowlati et al., 2010, (b) the differential expression of immune-related genes in the monocytes of people with bipolar disorder (BD) (Padmos et al., 2008), (c) the anti-inflammatory effect of antidepressant medication (De Berardis et al., 2010), (d) the induction of depression in up to 40% of cancer and hepatitis C patients during treatment with interferon alpha (INF\u03b1) (Capuron and Miller, 2004), (e) the induction of depressive symptoms in healthy individuals administered endotoxin (Eisenberger et al., 2009) or typhoid vaccine (Harrison et al., 2009a), (f) the epidemiological association between mood disorders and diseases with an autoimmune or inflammatory component such as multiple sclerosis (MS), cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus (Dalton and Heinrichs, 2005, Van der Kooy et al., 2007, Nouwen et al., 2010, (g) the increased production of neurotoxic kynurenine metabolites such as quinolinic acid in depressed individuals (Dantzer et al., 2011), (h) the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region with BD in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) (Williams et al., 2011, Hamshere et al., 2012 and (i) a reconceptualization of the immuno-privileged status of the CNS in light of literature demonstrating crosstalk between the brain and periphery via the vagus nerve, transport of cytokines across the blood brain barrier (Johnston and Webster, 2009), and brain infiltration by activated peripheral monocytes (D'Mello et al., 2009). Patients with MDD and BD also display neuromorphometric and neurophysiological abnormalities -in particular, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies show that compared with healthy controls, depressed patients display altered hemodynamic responses of the medial prefrontal cortex-limbic network to emotionally-valenced face stimuli and that these neurophysiological abnormalities are associated with the negative emotional processing biases characteristic of depression (Savitz and Drevets, 2009b). For example, using the backward masking paradigm that is described in the methods section below, we previously demonstrated that compared with healthy controls, MDD patients show an increased hemodynamic response in the amygdala and hippocampus to masked sad versus masked happy faces whereas healthy controls showed an increased hemodynamic response in the amygdala to masked happy versus masked sad and neutral faces (Victor et al., 2010). Moreover, these processing biases were subsequently reversed in MDD subjects by antidepressant treatment with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Regarding neuromorphometric abnormalities, our group first demonstrated that the mean gray matter volume of the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC), in particular the left sgACC, is abnormally reduced in patients with MDD and BD (Drevets et al., 1997) and that this abnormality is associated with a reduction in glial cell number (Ongur et al., 1998). These findings have been independently replicated by multiple laboratories (reviewed in (Drevets et al., 2008) and (Savitz and Drevets, 2009a), and decreased volume of sgACC has been proposed to be a potential endophenotype of MDD (Savitz and Drevets, 2009b). A reduction in gray matter volume of the hippocampus (effect size of ~0.4) is another often replicated finding in MDD (see meta-analyses by (Videbech and Ravnkilde, 2004, Koolschijn et al., 2009, Kempton et al., 2011, while reductions in volume of the caudate are increasingly being reported in both MDD and BD (see meta-analyses of (Koolschijn et al., 2009, Yu et al., 2010, Bora et al., 2012. Nevertheless, despite compelling evidence for dysfunction of both the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)-limbic network and the innate immune system in certain populations of people with mood disorders, very little is known about the relationship between molecular markers of inflammation and neurophysiological abnormalities in depression. This information is important because it may bring us closer to understanding the mechanisms behind the neurophysiological and/or neuroanatomical abnormalities observed in mood disorders. Here we present results in which one index of immune function, namely the gene expression of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), was significantly correlated with a robust depression-related neurophysiological abnormality, the hemodynamic response of the mPFC-limbic network to masked, emotionally-valenced faces. A number of the genes that were differentially expressed in the PBMCs of our mood disorder group are associated with neurological disorders and/or apoptosis. Given these findings, we also present the results of a post-hoc analysis of the correlation between the mRNA expression levels of these genes and morphometric abnormalities of the left sgACC, hippocampus, and caudate."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects", "text": "Subjects provided written informed consent after receiving a full explanation of the study procedures and risks, as approved by the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center IRB.

They were instructed to remember the faces and indicate with a button press using their right thumb whether each face that appeared on the screen was a target or nontarget face. Subjects were instructed that sad, happy and neutral faces would appear on the screen and they were to judge if a target face was present based on the person's identity, not the expression on their face. Subjects performed an abbreviated version of the task outside the scanner to demonstrate their understanding of the instructions. Each two second face trial displayed sad, happy, or neutral faces in pairs of two consisting of a \"masked\" and \"unmasked\" face. The following stimulus pairs were presented: sadneutral (SN), happy-neutral (HN), neutral-sad (NS), neutral-happy (NH) and neutral-neutral (NN) (figure 1). A sad or happy face that appeared in the masked face position was never also shown in the unmasked face position for any trial. Within a single trial, the identity of the masked face was never the same as the identity of the unmasked face, but the gender of the two faces was always the same. The gender for all stimulus pairings was balanced across runs. Each two second face trial consisted of the presentation of a masked face for 26ms immediately followed by an unmasked face for 107ms and then 1866ms of baseline (no image). In both runs, the five stimulus types were presented 40 times each. Two-hundred 2second face trials and sixty 2-second baseline trials were presented in addition to a baseline measurement at the beginning and end of the run.

Fourteen others are transcribed but produce no functional protein (italicized in the supplementary table). These include a 28s rRNA transcript and various small nuclear or nucleolar transcripts, plus six pseudogenes. What is most striking among the other genes is the extent to which many have been associated with neurological features or psychiatric illness (e.g. ADM, APBB3, CFD, CITED2, CTSZ, NR4A2, and TNF. See supplementary table). rtPCR was conducted on the 12 protein-coding genes in order to validate the microarray data. We found that only CTSZ, CFD, and NFKBIZ did not have a directional match when comparing the microarray analyses to the rtPCR analyses.

Here we not only showed that gene expression differences existed in PBMCs from a cohort of depressed patients relative to healthy, unrelated controls, but also that the expression patterns of many of these genes were associated with neurophysiological and neuromorphometric abnormalities in the patients with mood disorders. These results are discussed in more detail in the supplementary section but some of the more interesting genes that were differentially expressed between the mood disorder and healthy control groups are briefly discussed here. Adrenomedullin (ADM), which was increased in the mood disorder group versus the healthy control group, is a vasorelaxant that is part of the first-line protective (i.e. antiinflammatory) response to toxic or aversive stimuli such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Wong et al., 2005). A recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) implicated a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the vicinity of the ADM gene in a sample of subjects with type II BD (Huang et al., 2010). In addition, a functional SNP in the gene was associated with response to paroxetine (Glubb et al., 2010), and ADM was reported to be upregulated in a study using PBMCs in psychologically stressed individuals (Miller et al., 2008). The expression of nuclear receptor subfamily 4, group A, member 2 (NR4A2, also known as NURR1) was increased in the mood disorder group versus the healthy control group. NR4A2 has neuroprotective effects and plays an important role in the differentiation and maintenance of dopaminergic neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) during development. The mRNA expression of NR4A2 was found to be decreased in the prefrontal cortex (BA9 and BA46) of subjects with MDD and BD at postmortem (Xing et al., 2006). (Buervenich et al., 2000) sequenced the NR4A2 gene and reported that 2 patients with schizophrenia and one patient with BD, but no healthy controls, had missense mutations in the third exon of the gene that led to significant decreases in transcriptional activity. Similarly, (Chen et al., 2001) found an exonic deletion in two unrelated patients with schizophrenia that was not present in any healthy controls. The expression of tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF) was increased in the mood disorder group versus the healthy control group. Two recent meta-analyses reported a small but statistically significant increase in plasma levels of TNF in depression (Dowlati et al., 2010, Liu et al., 2012. In addition, a polymorphism in the TNF gene was associated with increased risk of developing MDD in the Genetic Association Information Network (GAIN) GWAS dataset (Bosker et al., 2011). We chose whole genome expression of PBMCs as our marker of immune function for several reasons. Firstly, this approach is not constrained by our incomplete knowledge of the specific immunological pathways underpinning mood disorders and could therefore facilitate the detection of unknown immunological pathways that mediate depressionassociated pathophysiology. Secondly, a number of studies have produced compelling results by using this approach. For example, (Padmos et al., 2008) performed whole-genome expression profiling on microarrays using purified monocytes and reported a distinct gene expression signature composed of aberrantly elevated expression of genes in patients with BD representing inflammatory and inflammation-related pathways. A follow-up rtPCR study using 19 of these genes showed >80% sensitivity and specificity for distinguishing unmedicated BD subjects and the depressed offspring of a BD parent from healthy controls (Padmos et al., 2008). Thirdly, alternative markers of inflammation such as plasma or serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines have certain limitations. Although meta-analyses have demonstrated that the levels of proinflammatory cytokines are elevated in depression, the effect size is very small (Dowlati et al., 2010, Liu et al., 2012, and in many individuals cytokine levels are below the detectable limit. An analysis that relied on correlating each subject's cytokine levels with neuroimaging data would thus suffer from a significant loss of statistical power. A small number of studies have examined the relationship between immune function and neuroimaging measures in healthy volunteers. (Marsland et al., 2008) reported an inverse correlation between IL-6 concentration and gray matter volume of the hippocampus. Although we did not obtain measurements of IL-6 in the plasma, we did observe a positive association between the expression of NR4A2 (table 3), which is neuroprotective, and hippocampal gray matter volume. In grieving women, IL1\u03b2 concentration was associated with a greater blood oxygenationdependent (BOLD) response in the sgACC during the recall of grief-related versus neutral words (O'Connor et al., 2009b). (Harrison et al., 2009a) conducted a double-blind, crossover study in which patients received either a typhoid vaccination or placebo and then completed an implicit emotional face perception task. The inflammation induced by the typhoid vaccination was shown to result in an increased hemodynamic response in the sgACC during the emotional face processing task, and reduced connectivity between the sgACC and regions such as the ventromedial PFC, amygdala, and nucleus accumbens. Here we found an inverse association between thickness of the left sgACC and the expression of CD160 (table 3). We also found a trend towards a significant inverse correlation between CITED2 expression and left sgACC thickness that may be explained by the fact that CD160 activation can trigger the production of cytokines while CITED2 is activated by LPS and by cytokines such as IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, and IFN-\u03b3. Using a similar design to (Harrison et al., 2009a), (Inagaki et al., 2012) showed that relative to the placebo condition, administration of low-dose endotoxin resulted in increased amygdala reactivity during the presentation of fearful faces. This finding is potentially consistent with our data showing correlations between hemodynamic response of the amygdala to sad faces and genes such as CFD and NFKBIZ which are involved in the inflammatory response. (Eisenberger et al., 2010) demonstrated that endotoxin-induced anhedonia was associated with reduced hemodynamic response in the ventral striatum to monetary rewards. Although we were not able to measure the ventral striatum per se with FreeSurfer, we did observe significant correlations between gray matter volume of the caudate and gene expression of ADM, NFKBIZ, NR4A2, SERTAD1, and TNF. The Ingenuity Pathway Analysis which showed an interaction between NF\u03ba\u03b2 and several of the differentially expressed genes (figure 3) is consistent with a genome-wide expression study of PBMCs in the familial care-givers of brain cancer patients (i.e. stressed individuals) which reported increased expression of transcripts with response elements for NF\u03ba\u03b2 (Miller et al., 2008). Similarly, increased NF\u03ba\u03b2 expression was recently reported in women with childhood abuse-related post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (Pace et al., 2012). The fact that CFD, IL23A, and NR4A2 have all been implicated in multiple sclerosis (MS) (see supplementary file) is consistent with microarray studies of postmortem brains which have reported overlapping functional pathways in BD and MS (reviewed in (Konradi et al., 2012). The prevalence of BD in MS patients is double that of the general population (Schiffer et al., 1986), and white matter hyperintensities are present in a subpopulation of patients with BD, including pediatric cases (reviewed in (Savitz and Drevets, 2009a). While the neuropathological process underlying MS may cause symptoms of BD, (Kosmidis et al., 2012) reported an extensive presence of both BD and MS in a multigenerational family, raising the possibility of a genetic overlap between the two disorders. More generally, the fact that a significant number of the differentially expressed genes have been associated with various autoimmune diseases is intriguing given the growing awareness of the biological links between mood disorders and autoimmune thyroiditis (Vonk et al., 2007), pernicious anemia, Crohn's disease, autoimmune hepatitis (Eaton et al., 2010), and type I diabetes (Korczak et al., 2011). It is also interesting that APBB3, CTSZ, NR4A2, and NUCKS1 have all been associated with various forms of dementia or aging-related pathology (see supplementary file). Depression is not only a prodromal symptom of AD, but early-onset, primary mood disorders increase the risk of developing AD later in life. A 17 year-follow-up of participants in the Framingham Heart study showed that depressed subjects had more than a 50% increase in the risk for developing AD and other dementias later in life (Saczynski et al., 2010). Similarly, the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging showed a monotonic increase in the risk for all-cause dementia based on the number of episodes of depression in the 24 year-follow-up period (Dotson et al., 2010). (Leonard, 2007) has suggested that the inflammation-induced neuropathological changes associated with depression precipitates the neurodegenerative changes characteristic of AD and other dementias. A significant strength of our study is that all participants were medication free. Mood stabilizing, antipsychotic, and antidepressant medications have all been demonstrated to affect immune function (Goldstein et al., 2009, De Berardis et al., 2010, Chen et al., 2012. Moreover, concurrent treatment with psychiatric medications confounds neuroimaging studies; for example antidepressant medication eliminates the hemodynamic response bias to masked sad faces (Victor et al., 2010) and lithium is neuroprotective, increasing gray matter volume (Moore et al., 2000, Bearden et al., 2007, Savitz et al., 2010. We tested for correlations between the imaging data and microarray data within the mood disorder group alone, rather than in the full sample of mood disorder and healthy control subjects. We took this approach for two reasons. Firstly, we wished to avoid the so-called \"double-dipping\" confound (Kriegeskorte et al., 2009). That is, correlating these fMRI and microarray data in the combined healthy control and mood disorder samples that we already demonstrated to differ on these immunological and neuroimaging variables would be a circular analysis. Secondly, the relationship between inflammation and neuroimaging abnormalities may be attenuated in healthy controls since even if psychiatrically healthy individuals do suffer from inflammation, they are presumably able to compensate. Our data raise the question of whether there is a causal relationship between depressionassociated immunological dysfunction and the neuroimaging abnormalities observed in people with mood disorders. Clearly our study design does not allow us to answer this question but there are plausible mechanisms by which dysregulation of the immune system may lead to neuropathology and/or neurophysiological abnormalities. Firstly, activated microglia are able to initiate an inflammatory cascade of cytokines, chemokines, and reactive nitrogen and oxygen species which directly damage neurons and compromise the reuptake of glutamate by astrocytes, leading to a secondary wave of excitotoxicity (Miller et al., 2009). Secondly, pro-inflammatory cytokines have been shown to upregulate indoleamine 2,3 deoxygenase (IDO) leading to a reduction in peripheral tryptophan levels together with increased synthesis of neurotoxic kynurenine metabolites (Capuron et al., 2002, Wichers et al., 2005, O'Connor et al., 2009a, Dantzer et al., 2011. Thirdly, interferon \u03b1 (IFN\u03b1), TNF, and IL1\u03b2 have been shown to upregulate the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) in vitro (Tsao et al., 2006, Zhu et al., 2006, while intraperitoneal administration of doublestranded DNA (which mimics a viral infection) increased expression of IFN\u03b1 and 5-HTT but decreased extracellular serotonin in the medial prefrontal cortices of mice (Katafuchi et al., 2006). Fourthly, inflammation may lead to a decrease in tetrahydrobiopterin (BH 4 ) which is a cofactor for the production of both serotonin and dopamine (van Amsterdam andOpperhuizen, 1999, Hoekstra et al., 2006)."}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "It is not clear what cell types were responsible for the mood disorder-associated differences in gene expression in our study. The fact that we examined PBMCs rather than monocytes may explain why we were unable to replicate the results of (Padmos et al., 2008). Signal-tonoise ratio may be increased in future studies by focusing on one particular type of immune cell. We combined the BD and MDD patient groups together. While it is possible that MDD and BD are etiologically distinct disorders that display distinct transcriptomic and neuroimaging signatures, there is extensive genetic, clinical, neurophysiological, and neuromorphometric overlap between the two disorders that is not captured by current nosological categories. The failure of current diagnostic categories to align with emerging findings from clinical neuroscience and genetics has culminated in the Research Domain Criteria (RDOC) initiative of the National Institutes of Health which promotes a neuroscience-based approach to psychiatric classification that entails discarding extant nosology (Insel et al., 2010). It is within the spirit of this paradigm that we combined the MDD and BD groups in this study. Moreover, given the challenges in recruiting unmedicated patients with BD, merging the BD and MDD group had the practical utility of increasing the statistical power of the study. No independent marker of general inflammation -for example C-reactive protein (CRP)was available. It would have been informative to assess whether CRP levels differed between the healthy control and mood disorder groups, and whether CRP levels correlated with differential gene expression within the mood disorder group. We examined peripheral immune function (PBMC expression) rather than the gene expression of microglial cells, and thus it is theoretically possible that our data do not reflect central immune function. However, there are a number of reasons why PBMC expression might provide an accurate account of central immune function. In general, the expression levels of many biological processes have been shown to be comparable between whole blood and the prefrontal cortex (Sullivan et al., 2006). Secondly, as discussed above, there is extensive evidence for crosstalk between the CNS and periphery. Pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPS) and cytokines activate primary afferent nerves such as the vagus nerve which projects to numerous brain regions involved in the behavioral and autonomic responses to stress such as the periventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, periaqueductal gray matter, and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) (Dantzer et al., 2008). Moreover, cytokines and certain neurotoxic kynurenine metabolies such as 3hydroxykynurenine freely diffuse across the blood brain barrier (Schwarcz et al., 2012) while activated macrophage cells are capable of infiltrating the CNS (D'Mello et al., 2009). Thirdly, experimental manipulations of the peripheral immune response using endotoxin or the typhoid vaccine produce an increase in symptoms of depression concomitant with abnormal brain activity in regions including the sgACC, dorsolateral PFC, amygdala, ventral striatum, and insula (Harrison et al., 2009a, Harrison et al., 2009b, Eisenberger et al., 2010, Inagaki et al., 2012. Fourthly, 7 out of the 12 genes (ADM, APBB3, CFD, CITED2, CTSZ, NR4A2, and TNF) that were differentially expressed in the mood disorder group, have been associated with neurological or psychiatric diseases, suggesting at least a partial correspondence between markers of peripheral and central immune function. While the fMRI study was likely to have been adequately powered -with a moderate to large effect size of 0.7-0.8 (the required sample size for 80% power in an fMRI study designed using methods like those we applied is 20-26 subjects per group) (Kraemer and Kupfer, 2006), the morphometric MRI analysis was underpowered, largely due to the relatively small subset of the control subjects for whom the volumetric MRI data were available, possibly explaining the absence of significant differences in volume/thickness between the subject groups. Given the dearth of whole-genome microarray studies in mood disorders, the adequacy of our sample size for the immunological component of the study is unclear. However, given the heterogeneity of patients with mood disorders at both the neurophysiological and immunological level, future studies would be enhanced by the inclusion of a greater number of participants."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "In this study we attempted to bridge the gap between molecular-level abnormalities in immune function and macro-level neurophysiology and neuroanatomy. Our results provide initial support to the hypothesis that depression-associated immune dysfunction can be mapped onto depression-related neuromorphometric and neurophysiological abnormalities, and suggest that this approach may be a fruitful avenue for future research. The relationship between immunological and neurophysiological abnormalities is important to understand because it may allow for the identification of specific molecular pathways that mediate the neuroimaging abnormalities associated with mood disorders. Conceivably this knowledge will facilitate the development of new treatments for mood disorders. Clearly given the complexity of both immunological function and neuropathophysiology, the imprecision inherent in microarray and neuroimaging measurements, and the heterogeneous nature of mood disorders, our results are not straightforward to interpret and may have been confounded by both type I and type II errors. Larger replication samples may be needed to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio in this type of data. Backward masking task design. Example images of sad and happy faces in the masked face position are shown for the sad-neutral (SN) and happy-neutral (HN) conditions with placeholders (\"N\") to represent the presentation of neutral faces. The first face was presented for 26ms, followed by a 107ms neutral face, followed by no image for the remainder of the two-second trial. The interstimulus interval (ISI) ranged from 0-8 seconds. No image was displayed during the ISI.

Refer to the figure 2 legend for an explanation of the format. Image sections from a statistical parametric map of voxel t-values showing regions where the hemodynamic response to masked happy versus masked sad faces is significantly decreased (blue color) in the mood disorder group versus the healthy control group. Stereotaxic coordinates provided beneath each section image denote the distance in mm from the stereotaxic origin (anterior commissure), with positive x indicating right of midline (for sagittal sections), positive y indicating anterior (for coronal sections), and positive z indicating dorsal (for horizontal sections). Bar-histograms showing the beta-weights for the blood oxygen level dependence (BOLD) responses of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus for the SN-HN contrast. The beta-weights for the healthy control group are shown in yellow and the betaweights for the mood disorder group are shown in blue. The negative beta-weights indicate a greater hemodynamic response to masked happy faces than masked sad faces, and the positive beta-weights indicate a greater hemodynamic response to masked sad than masked happy faces. The error bars represent the standard error of the mean. BMI = body mass index, HAM-D = Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Note that two BD subjects had scores below the moderate-to-severe range (scores of 6 and 13, respectively). The range of Ham-D scores in the mood disorder group without these 2 participants was 19-39."}]
