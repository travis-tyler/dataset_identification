[{"section_title": "InfoBrIef SRS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Science Resources Statistics", "text": "I n a February 2008 article in the Washington Post, the presidents of four Maryland historically black institutions raised the issue of the role and relevance of historically black institutions in enhancing educational opportunities for African Americans (Avery et al 2008). This InfoBrief partially addresses this issue by examining the role of historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) as baccalaureate-origin institutions of black science and engineering (S&E) 2 doctorate recipients. It examines trends primarily during the past two decades and compares HBCUs to non-HBCU institutions, to different Carnegie types of institutions, 3 and to a select group of baccalaureate colleges-the Oberlin 50 (minus Hampton University which is an HBCU). 4 The InfoBrief also examines differences between public and private institutions. The analysis focuses on two types of output variables: the absolute number of doctorates and the institutional yield-the number of S&E doctorates in a given year per thousand bachelor's degrees awarded in all fields 9 years (the median time from bachelor's-todoctorate receipt for S&E doctorates) prior to that year. In the late 1970s over 40% of black S&E doctorate recipients received their baccalaureate degrees from HBCUs. 5 This percentage fell to 25% in the first part of the 1990s before increasing to about 33% in 2006. During the same period , the share of blacks receiving bachelor's degrees from HBCUs fell from 36% to 21% (figure 1).  1978, 1980, 1982-84, 1986, 1988, and 1999. SOURCES: National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources Statistics, Survey of Earned Doctorates, 1977-2006and National Center for Education Statistics, IPEDs Completions Survey, 1977-2006  Although only one-quarter to one-third of black S&E doctorate recipients received their bachelor's degrees from HBCUs from 1986 to 2006, when normalized by the number of bachelor's degrees awarded, HBCUs as a group yielded about as many future S&E doctorates per thousand bachelor's awarded as non-HBCU institutions during this period. The trends for both groups were similar (figure 2)."}, {"section_title": "Baccalaureate-Origin Institutions of Black S&E Doctorate Recipients Normalized for Black Bachelor's Degrees Awarded", "text": "A recently released InfoBrief 6 showed that although baccalaureate colleges graduate relatively small numbers of undergraduate degree holders compared to doctorate-and master's-granting institutions, when normalized by the number of bachelor's degrees awarded, the baccalaureate colleges as a group yield more future S&E doctorates than other types of institutions, except research universities. Figure 3 shows that for 9 of the 14 years shown, baccalaureate colleges also yielded more future black S&E doctorates than other types of institutions, except research universities. Between 1986 and 1998, both the non-HBCU research universities and the non-HBCU baccalaureate colleges yielded more future black S&E doctorates than the HBCUs. However, between 1999 and 2006, HBCUs and non-HBCU baccalaureate colleges yielded similar numbers of future black S&E doctorates. During this latter period the HBCUs yielded more black S&E doctorates than either non-HBCU other doctorate-granting or non-HBCU master's institutions (figure 3). The yield ratios of all of these types of institutions generally increased between 1986 and the late 1990s, reaching their peak in 1999 or 2000, and have generally declined since then. Comparing public and private institutions, private schools, whether non-HBCU research universities, non-HBCU baccalaureate colleges, or HBCUs, outperform comparable public schools in the proportion of their black bachelor's degree recipients becoming future S&E doctorate recipients (figure 4). The number of 2006 black S&E doctorate recipients per thousand black bachelor's degrees awarded in all fields 9 years earlier is highest among private non-HBCU research universities and the Oberlin 49 baccalaureate colleges. Private HBCUs as a group have a yield similar to all private non-HBCU baccalaureate colleges and public non-HBCU research universities (figure 4).   1978, 1980, 1982-84, 1986, and 1988 1986 1990 1994 1998 2002 2006 Year of doctorate Ratio HBCU = historically black college or university."}, {"section_title": "Top Schools From Which Black S&E Doctorate Recipients Received Bachelor's Degrees", "text": "NOTES: Includes only U.S. citizens and permanent residents.

The Oberlin 50 is a group of 50 small, private baccalaureate schools that was studied in the mid-1980s and was found at that time to contribute greatly to the production of future S&E doctorates. Hampton University is also an HBCU and is therefore eliminated from the group to obtain the Oberlin 49.
