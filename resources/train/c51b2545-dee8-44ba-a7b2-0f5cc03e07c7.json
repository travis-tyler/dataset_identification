[{"section_title": "", "text": "pharma there is little scope or incentive for undertaking this type of exploratory research if one can use an existing biomarker or form a strategic collaboration instead.\nAcademia and small biotechnology firms have long provided tools that big pharma scales up for its own use, particularly for areas in which technology has been a ratelimiting step. Why not extend this collaboration to clinical development? In addition to working together in clinical research, a topic addressed by Garret FitzGerald in an upcoming Perspective article, collaboration on technology development is crucial if big pharma is to implement biomarkers and other tools in experimental medicine.\nThis view is certainly shared by those involved in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), a public-private consortium set up to tackle the issue of validation of neurological imaging tools. The ADNI is an exemplar of what can be done through a combination of government and industrial funding, and the sharing of data and methods between different research communities (see p616 in News and Analysis). However, although this shows a willingness to cooperate, a recent US Supreme Court ruling that broadens the definition of 'safe harbour' has created uncertainty for research tool companies, which many lawyers worry could lead to less investment, less research and, ultimately, fewer new research tools for bigpharma companies (see News and Analysis, July 2005). Littman and Williams acknowledge that biomarker technology development will be incremental and will require long-term collaboration between academia, small biotechs and big pharma -something for the pharmaceutical industry and the lower courts to keep in mind.\nBut there is reason to see the ADNI as an encouraging sign of things to come. Academia and the pharmaceutical industry increasingly recognize the need to work together on translational research, and the NIH Roadmap initiative and the FDA's eagerness to assist with discussion about biomarkers and other measurements outlined in its Critical Path report provide an unprecedented opportunity to do just this. It seems there really is no better time than now to turn the potential of translational research into reality."}]
