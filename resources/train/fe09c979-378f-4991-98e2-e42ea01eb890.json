This practice, often referred to as \"tuition discounting,\" has grown rapidly in recent years (Redd 2000;Cunningham et al. 2001;Hubbell and Lapovsky 2002). Depending on the type and selectivity of the institution, institutional aid is awarded for different reasons. Some institutions aim to promote access to lowincome and otherwise disadvantaged students, others use institutional aid to increase the enrollment of meritorious students, and still others use it to increase tuition revenues (Allan 1999;Redd 2000). Many institutions are trying to accomplish more than one of these goals simultaneously (Redd 2000). Through the packaging of need-based and merit-based aid, different institutions use different strategies. For example, a need-within-merit strategy uses merit criteria, but prioritizes the recipients on the basis of need, whereas a merit-within-need strategy awards aid on the basis of need, but prioritizes the recipients on the basis of merit. This study provides information about recent trends in institutional aid receipt and then examines the relationship between such aid and the likelihood of recipients staying enrolled in the awarding institution relative to comparable unaided students. The trend analysis is based on data gathered from three administrations of the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study, conducted in 1992-93, 1995-96, and 1999(NPSAS:93, NPSAS:96, and NPSAS:2000, and the retention analysis is based on data from the first and second follow-ups to the 1995-96 Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS:96/01). BPS followed a cohort of students who first enrolled in college in 1995-96 and were last surveyed in 2001, about 6 years after their initial enrollment. Only full-time students attending 4-year public and private not-for-profit institutions were included in these analyses. Trends in Institutional Aid: 1992-93 to 1999 Consistent with earlier studies reporting large increases in spending on institutional aid by 4-year colleges and universities (e.g., Cunningham et al. 2001), this study found that the percentage of fulltime undergraduates in 4-year colleges and universities who received institutional aid increased over the last decade, both in the public and private not-for-profit sectors (figure A).1 In 1992-93, 17 percent of undergraduates in public institutions received institutional aid, averaging about $2,200 (after adjusting for inflation to 1999 dollars). By 1999-2000, 23 percent received such aid, averaging about $2,700. In private not-forprofit institutions, 47 percent received institutional aid, averaging about $5,900 in 1992-93, while 58 percent did so in 1999-2000, averaging about $7,000. Over the same period, there was a notable increase in the percentage of undergraduates in the lInstitutional aid includes both need-based and merit-based aid. Figure A. Percentage of full-time undergraduates enrolled in 4-year institutions who received institutional aid and among recipients, the average amount received in constant 1999 dollars, by institution control: 1992-93, 1995-96, and 1999-2000 Percent received aid quartiles to receive merit aid. By 1999, no difference could be detected between the percentages of middle-and high-income students receiving merit aid (roughly 30 percent in each group did so), and students in both these income groups were more likely than low-income students (23 percent) to receive such aid. In other words, in private not-for-profit institutions, in the early to mid-1990s, middle-income students appeared to be favored over both high-income and low-income students in terms of receiving institutional merit aid. Institutions might award institutional aid in such a manner because lowincome students are more eligible for need-based aid and high-income students have more discretionary income. However, by 1999However, by -2000 difference could be detected between those in the middle-and high-income quartiles, and students in both income groups were more likely to receive merit aid than their low-income peers. As shown in figure E, need-based and meritbased institutional aid awards are often packaged together. In private not-for-profit institutions, where merit aid is most likely to be awarded, among full-time undergraduates, 44 percent of those who received need-based aid in 1999-2000 also received merit-based aid; among students who Figure E.

Taking into account the various need-within-merit and merit-within-need award strategies that institutions might use to increase institutional aid across income levels, if the trend in increased aid was aimed at all students, the notable increase in merit aid awards to highincome students in private not-for-profit institutions that occurred between 1995-96 and 1999-2000 would have been accompanied by a corresponding increase in total aid to low-income and most middle-income students, who are eligible for need-based aid. However, as is shown in figure B, this does not appear to be the case. Looking at total institutional aid, which includes both need and merit aid, no increase was observed in the percentage of either low-or middle-income students receiving aid between 1995-96 and 1999-2000, while awards to high-income students increased from 41 to 51 percent. Academic Merit, Financial Need, and Institutional Grant Aid Among First-Year Students Among undergraduates who enrolled in a 4year college or university for the first time in 1995-96, about 38 percent of full-time students received institutional grant aid, including about one-quarter (24 percent) in public institutions and nearly two-thirds (62 percent) in private not-forprofit institutions. Institutional aid can be awarded on the basis of financial need, academic merit, or both need and merit. In addition, depending on the selectivity of the institution, institutional aid packages and amounts may vary. Therefore, in this analysis, students' high school academic merit,3 their 3Levels of academic merit were based on an index incorporating three academic measures: college entrance exam scores, degree of high school curriculum difficulty, and high school grade-point average (GPA). financial need,4 and the selectivity of institutions5 were taken into account when examining patterns of receipt of institutional grant aid. Many of the differences observed in institutional grant aid awards were related to the selectivity of the institution. For example, in both public and private not-for-profit institutions, the likelihood of awarding institutional aid in very selective institutions did not vary significantly with students' academic merit, whereas in less selective institutions, it did. In less selective institutions, as students' high school academic merit increased, so did their likelihood of receiving institutional grant aid. Differences by institution selectivity were also evident when examining the relationship between institutional aid awards and students' financial need, especially in the private sector. In very selective private not-for-profit institutions, as students' financial need rose, so did their likelihood of receiving institutional grant aid, from 21 percent of those with low financial need, to 59 percent with moderate need, to 66 percent with high need. In less selective institutions, on the other hand, while there was an association between institutional aid awards and financial need, fully one-half (51 percent) of students with low financial need received institutional grant aid, as did 71 percent of both those with moderate and high need. 4Levels of financial need were based on the student budget reported by the institution (which includes the cost of tuition, books, and transportation, plus living expenses) after subtracting the expected family contribution (EFC) and government grant aid (both federal and state). This is the amount that institutions typically take into account before committing their own funds. This definition differs from the federal need definition, which is student budget minus EFC. 5lnstitution selectivity was based on the SAT or equivalent ACT scores of entering students. Institutions where at least 75 percent of entering students scored above 1000 on the SAT were considered \"very selective.\" All others were identified as \"less selective.\" (See appendix A for detailed descriptions of variables.) viii JL 0"}, {"section_title": "Executive Summary", "text": "In both less selective and very selective public institutions, students' likelihood of receiving institutional grant aid was clearly associated with their financial need. Students with no financial need were less likely to receive institutional grant aid than their counterparts with high need. However, students with no financial need were more likely to receive institutional grant aid in less selective institutions than in very selective institutions, whereas those with high need were more likely to receive aid in very selective institutions. When looking at students' financial need in relation to their high school academic merit, positive associations between students' financial need and the likelihood of receiving institutional aid awards remained for those who had achieved no higher than moderate levels of high school academic merit. This was observed for all institution types, including less selective private not-for-profit institutions: at such institutions, among those who had achieved moderate levels of academic merit, 69 percent with high need received institutional grant aid, compared with 47 percent with low need. However, as discussed below, for students who had achieved high levels of academic merit, whether or not they received institutional grant aid in less selective institutions did not vary significantly with their financial need."}, {"section_title": "Students With High Academic Merit", "text": "As shown in figures F and G, students enrolled in less selective institutions who had achieved high academic merit in high school were more likely to receive institutional grant aid than their high-merit counterparts in very selective institutions.

In very selective institutions, on the other hand, high-merit students with high financial need were more likely to receive institutional aid than their counterparts with low (or no) need. For high-merit students who received institutional grant aid, the average amount received as a percentage of tuition varied by institution selectivity in private not-for-profit institutions 6In public less selective institutions, the difference between the percentages of students with no need and high need who received institutional grant aid appeared to be different (44 vs. 66 percent), but because of large standard errors for high-merit students with high need, there was not enough statistical evidence to confirm the difference. (figure H): those in very selective institutions received about 58 percent of their tuition amounts, compared with 46 percent in less selective institutions. However, in the same sector, only in very selective institutions did the amount of institutional aid received vary by aid recipients' financial need. Specifically, in very selective institutions, high-merit recipients with high financial need received enough institutional grant aid to pay for about two-thirds of their tuition, compared with about one-half of tuition for highmerit recipients with moderate or low need. In less selective private not-for-profit institutions, on the other hand, no difference in the average amounts received by high-merit recipients could be detected among students in terms of their financial need.? 7The aid amounts for high-merit students with high need and low need appear to be different (51 vs. 41 percent of tuition), but there was not enough statistical evidence to confirm the difference.

The study also found that students who achieved high academic merit in high school were more likely to receive institutional grant aid if they attended less selective rather than very selective institutions (in both the public and private not-forprofit sectors). However, an association between high-merit students receiving such aid and their financial need was not readily apparent in less selective private not-for-profit institutions, whereas in very selective institutions (both public and private not-for-profit), the likelihood of high-merit 10While the analysis controlled for observable student characteristics that might be related to persistence, it is possible that unobservable characteristics are related both to the receipt of institutional aid and persistence. For example, an institution might be more likely to give aid to students it perceives as more likely to succeed over students with comparable merit and need. Executive Summary students receiving institutional grant aid increased with their financial need. There was evidence that receiving institutional grant aid as freshmen was related to higher 1-year retention rates for certain groups of students, namely, those who had achieved moderate levels of academic merit and had enrolled in less selective institutions (both public and private notfor-profit), as well as those who had achieved high academic merit and enrolled in very selective public institutions. However, an association between institutional grant aid receipt in the first year and 6-year institutional retention (or degree attainment) was only evident among students in public institutions. Taken together, the results are consistent with those of other studies reporting higher spending by 4-year colleges and universities on institutional aid (e.g., Cunningham et al. 2001), especially by less selective private institutions (Redd 2000;and Hubbell and Lapovsky 2002). Also, as discussed in Duffy and Goldberg (1998), the findings revealed that in the late 1990s, the percentage of highincome students receiving institutional grant aid (in particular merit aid) increased, as did the average amount they received. This study could not address whether institutional grant aid awards had increased the enrollment of the types of students that institutions sought. However, the findings did indicate that in private not-for-profit institutions, where most institutional grant aid is awarded, no measurable association could be detected between students' receipt of institutional grant aid as freshmen and their graduating from the awarding institution (compared to unaided students), once other factors such as students' academic merit, students' financial need, and institutional selectivity were taken into consideration."}, {"section_title": "Foreword", "text": "This study provides information about recent trends in institutional aid receipt and then examines the relationship between such aid and the likelihood of recipients staying enrolled in the awarding institution relative to comparable unaided students.

and 1999-2000 Introduction Many colleges and universities, both public and private, provide grant aid to undergraduates to help them pay for all or part of the tuition and fees charged by the institution. This practice, often referred to as \"tuition discounting,\" has grown rapidly in recent years. For example, in a recent NCES study on college costs, researchers found that in the 10-year period between 1988-89 and 1998-99, institutional grant aid was the fastest growing expenditure at both public and private institutions. At public research/doctoral institutions, for example, institutional aid increased by 8.1 percent annually (adjusted for inflation), and in comparable private institutions, it increased by 8.8 percent annually (Cunningham, Wellman, Merisotis, and Clinedinst 2001). According to the annual Tuition Discounting Survey conducted by the National Association of College and University Business Officers (NACUBO), the average discounting rate as of February 2001 was 38.2 percent,' an increase of 1 percentage point from the previous year among small colleges, and 0.7 percent among large colleges and universities (Hubbell and Lapovsky 2002). The growth in institutional aid awards has been accompanied by both an increase in tuition and fees and low growth in undergraduate enrollment. For example, between 1989-90 and 1998-99, inflation-adjusted tuition rose 41 percent at private not-for-profit 4-year institutions and 53 percent at public 4-year institutions. During the same period, median family income grew 10 percent, and federally sponsored Pell Grant programsdesigned to assist low-income students pay for their college educationgrew 19 percent (The College Board 1999). Undergraduate fall enrollment at 4-year institutions of higher education fluctuated during the period, increasing from 8.2 to 8.7 million between 1988 and 1991 and then remaining stable at between 8.7 and 8.8 million through 1997 (U.S. Department of Education 2001, table 174). However, the most recent projections from the Department of Education indicate that between 2000 and 2012, enrollment will increase about 19 percent in public 4-year institutions and about 16 percent at private 4-year institutions (U.S. Department of Education 2002). In the 1990s, the increase in the price of attending college combined with low enrollment growth brought pressure on colleges and universities to attract, on one hand, meritorious or otherwise talented students who help maintain the institution's reputation and, on the other, Introduction students capable of paying all or part of their tuition. In addition, students and their parents are increasingly becoming more savvy consumers in shopping for the \"best deal\" offered by competing colleges.2 Depending on the type of institution and its selectivity, the institution uses tuition discounting for different reasons. Smaller, \"less-selective\" colleges may use it simply to attract enough students to achieve enrollment goals (Lee and Clery 1998). At the other extreme, \"highly selective\" institutions, capable of filling enrollment slots with students whose families can afford full tuition, may use discounts to \"enhance the quality and diversity of their student bodies\" (Allan 1999, p. 9). Many institutions are trying to do bothto enroll students with demonstrated financial need and high academic ability (Redd 2000). Increasingly, however, institutions are offering no-need scholarships to high-ability applicants in order to \"attract and enroll students who otherwise would not attend an institution\" (Duffy and Goldberg 1998, p. 208). Consequently, students from middle-and upper-income families often receive such merit-based financial aid (Duffy and Goldberg 1998). Institutions that award grant aid may do so at a price. The more aid directed at incoming students, the more the institution has to raise tuition, reduce the amount it spends on instruction and other services, or do both (Allan 1999). This is especially true for colleges with little or no endowment or alumni support that can be targeted to institutional aid. To help with the increasingly complicated process of managing enrollment, many public and private colleges are hiring \"deans of enrollment management\" to help them balance the potentially conflicting needs of the students and the colleges (Toch 1998). To achieve the goals of improving admissions yield or maximizing tuition, institutions may use two common strategies known as preferential packaging and price sensitivity. Preferential packaging aims to include more grant money and fewer loans and work-study in the need-based awards of the most desirable candidates in order to recognize their academic achievement or other distinctions (Duffy and Goldberg 1998, p. 222). In other words, within a need-based framework, the stronger a needy student's academic profile, the more attractive the aid package. Price sensitivity refers to the way in which students respond to the \"sticker price\" of the institution regardless of need. Depending on the value the institution places on the student, the institution packages financial aid based on how much a student wants to attend. For example, an institution may consider whether a student was admitted early or has previously visited the campus, combined with whether the student has applied to or been accepted by other colleges, when offering the student financial aid (Ehrenberg 2000). The question, therefore, is no longer Introduction who can afford to come at what price but rather \"who is likely to come at what price\" (Gaudiani 2000). In an effort to boost tuition revenues, some institutions use another strategy: they offer a small amount of grant money to students who are not eligible for need-based aid. In attracting students with partial merit scholarships, institutions perceive a two-tiered effect: increasing the number of students with diverse talents and achievements, which in turn enhances its reputation and the value of its degrees, thus making that institution more attractive to other students. Proponents of merit aid argue that it serves a social good by distributing the top-performing students throughout the colleges and universities rather than collecting them at the more prestigious institutions. McPherson and Schapiro (1991) found \"...some evidence that highly talented students, at least in the right circumstances, confer educational benefits on their fellow students.... It may be useful to offer a merit scholarship to a student at a less prestigious institution as a 'payment' for an educational service that a student can perform\" (p. 151). However, among schools of equal prestige or reputation, the same authors argue that the competition will simply \"move students within this group of schools, but will not affect the overall distribution of high-ranking students by institutional quality\" (McPherson and Schapiro 1994, p. 3). The main effect, the authors note, is to redistribute dollars between schools and students rather than to redistribute students among schools. Whether colleges and universities can reconcile the potential conflicting aims of institutional financial aidpromoting access to low-income and otherwise disadvantaged students, increasing the enrollment of meritorious students, and increasing tuition revenuesit is possible that the current discounting practices may lead to losses in revenue without necessarily achieving the desired results. One study, for example, found that the least selective institutions those with fewer resources and endowmentspaid more nonneed aid per student than the most selective schools (McPherson and Schapiro 1998, pp. 116, 119). Another study determined that tuition discounts for a number of private institutions had led to losses in net revenue resulting in lower increases in the funds for instruction and other critical services to students (Redd 2000).3 Further, the same study found that private institutions with the largest increases in spending on tuition discounting experienced the smallest increases in the number of freshmen resulting in a 5 percent decline in total undergraduate enrollments. The study, however, also concluded that tuition discounting increased the enrollment of low-income students at private colleges and universities. 3The study is based on a sample of 275 accredited 4-year private colleges and universities that responded annually (from 1990-Introduction For those institutions that are successful in attracting new students, there is little information on how well they retain them. Redd (2000) examined the graduation rates of 187 NCAA-member private institutions who responded to the NACUBO survey to determine the extent to which they had increased their spending on tuition discounting. The results of this limited study suggested that colleges that had substantially increased their tuition discounting did not experience higher graduation rates 6 years later than colleges that had not increased their spending at that rate."}, {"section_title": "Research Questions", "text": "The purpose of this study is to provide information about how institutional aid is distributed from the student perspective.

This cohort was analyzed to determine how institutional grant aid was awarded to entering students in their first year in relation to their academic merit and financial need and then to examine whether institutional grant aid was associated with students' likelihood of staying enrolled at the awarding institution. The BPS data set includes information obtained from the Educational Testing Service (ETS) and the ACT Assessment\u00ae program on academic courses that students reported taking; this information was used to determine students' academic merit.

At the same time, the percentage of high-income students receiving institutional aid increased in each survey year from 35 to 41 to 51 percent.

Among institutional aid recipients in private not-for-profit institutions, those in the middleincome quartiles received higher amounts of aid on average than those in either the low-or highincome quartiles in all survey years. In 1999-2000, middle-income recipients were awarded an average $7,500, compared with $6,200 and $6,800, respectively for low-and high-income students.

During this period, the percentage of full-time undergraduates who received institutional merit aid awards increased from 7 to 10 percent in public institutions (table 2a) and from 21 to 29 percent in private not-for-profit institutions (table  2b).7 In contrast, between 1992-93 and 1995-96, no increase was detected in students' likelihood of receiving merit aid in either public institutions or private not-for-profit institutions.

The likelihood of receiving merit aid did not vary by family income in public 4-year institutions (i.e., no differences were detected among income quartiles in all three survey years) (table 2a). In private not-for-profit institutions, on the other hand, differences were detected over time. As shown in figure 3, in 1992-93 and 1995-96, undergraduates in the combined middleincome quartiles were more likely than students in both the highest-and lowest-income quartiles to receive merit aid. By 1999-2000, however, no difference could be detected between those in the middle-and high-income quartiles (roughly 30 percent received merit aid), and the lowest income students were the least likely of all to receive such aid (23 percent).  1992-93,1995-96, and 1999-2000  In other words, in the early to mid-1990s, middle-income students appeared to be favored for receiving merit aid over both high-and low-income students in private not-for-profit institutions, as was determined for total aid awards. This finding might be expected because lowincome students are more likely to receive need-based financial aid and high-income students have more discretionary income to pay tuition. But by 1999-2000, no difference could be detected in the percentage of those in the middle-and high-income quartiles who received merit aid, and students in both groups were more likely than their low-income peers to do so. In summary, the trend analysis of institutional aid receipt indicated that the percentage of full-time students receiving institutional aid increased between the early and late 1990s. Increases in the proportions of students who received institutional aid in the latter time period (between 1995-96 and 1999-2000) were especially apparent for those in the highest income quartile, and much of this increase was in the form of aid based exclusively on merit. Academic Merit, Financial Need, and Institutional Grant Aid Among Beginning Students in 1995-96\nAs shown in table 6, in private not-for-profit institutions, a positive association between levels of academic merit and institutional aid receipt was evident in less selective institutions, but not in very selective institutions. That is, in less selective institutions, as levels of academic merit increased there was a corresponding increase in the likelihood of receiving institutional grant aid: from 62 percent for low-merit students, to 69 percent for middle-merit students, to 87 percent for high-merit students. A similar pattern could not be detected for students in very selective institutions. In very selective institutions, on the other hand, there was a clear association between students' financial need and the likelihood of receiving institutional grant aid, from 21 to 59 to 66 percent for low-, moderate-, and high-need students, respectively. In less selective institutions, while there was an association between need and aid receipt, fully 51 percent of lowneed students received institutional grant aid, while 71 percent of both moderate-and high-need students did so. 'Totals may not match percentages in table 6 exactly because they are for respondents with a valid merit index. There were about 7 percent of respondents missing the merit index, which accounts for the differences. 2 Based on a composite index of SAT score, high school academic curriculum, and high school grades (see appendix A for details). 3 Very selective institutions are those in which at least 75 percent of entering students scored above 1000 on the SAT exam. Less selective institutions are all others. 4 Need is defined as the amount remaining after the Expected Family Contribution (EFC) and federal and state grants are subtracted from the total student budget. \nIn private-not-for-profit institutions, institutional aid recipients in very selective institutions received higher amounts of aid as a percent of tuition (56 percent) than their counterparts in less selective institutions (39 percent) (table 7b). This difference was determined within each merit group. For example, among high-merit students, those in very selective institutions received enough aid to cover 58 percent of their tuition, while those in less selective institutions received enough to cover 46 percent of their tuition. Examining amounts of institutional grant aid in relation to recipients' financial need revealed two differences that could be detected: among high-merit students in very selective institutions, high-need students received more aid (64 percent of tuition) than those with either moderate or low need (48 and 49 percent of tuition, respectively).\nAs in less selective public institutions, middle-merit students in less selective private notfor-profit institutions who received institutional grant aid were more likely than their unaided counterparts to stay enrolled (87 vs. 70 percent) in their first year and less likely to transfer (11 vs. 27 percent) (table 8b). Paradoxically, low-merit aid recipients in these institutions were less likely to stay enrolled (62 vs. 82 percent) and more likely to transfer (24 vs. 12 percent) than their unaided counterparts. It is not clear why this would occur. In very selective private not-for-profit institutions, small sample sizes made it difficult to determine differences in 1-year retention rates between aided and unaided students. While it appears as though high-merit aid recipients were more likely to stay enrolled than their unaided counterparts (88 vs. 81 percent), and that middle-merit aid recipients were less likely to leave postsecondary education than their unaided counterparts (less than 1 percent vs. 11 percent), there was not enough statistical evidence to confirm the differences. There were too few lowmerit students who received institutional aid to report estimates.\nIn private not-for-profit institutions, no differences could be detected between aided and unaided students in whether they had attained a degree from or were still enrolled at the awarding institutions (table 9b). This was found across all levels of merit in both less selective and very selective institutions. For instance, 67 percent of middle-merit students who received Table 9b.

The merit index is based on SAT (or equivalent ACT) scores, high school academic curriculum, and high school grade-point average (GPA). Values for each of the three component variables (exam scores, curriculum, and GPA) were roughly divided into quartiles (combining the middle two), with three possible values for each variable representing low (1), middle (2), and high (3) levels. Students' merit index scores were empirically assigned to merit levels based on their likelihood of enrolling in selective institutions. Because institution selectivity is based almost exclusively on SAT score distributions, this empirical coding scheme was closely aligned to SAT scores. However, there were some exceptions: students with middlelevel SAT scores but high-level curriculum and GPA scores were coded as \"high merit\"; students with high-level SAT scores but either a low curriculum or GPA score were coded as \"middle merit\"; and students with middle-level SAT scores but low curriculum and GPA scores were coded as \"low merit.\" In this way, the merit index provided a more comprehensive depiction of students' academic accomplishments. Among 1995-96 full-time beginning 4-year college students, 29 percent were in the lowmerit group, 44 percent were in the middle-merit group, and 28 percent demonstrated high-level academic merit (table 3a). Among those whose SAT score was in the highest quartile (1100 to 1600), 93 percent were in the high-merit group, and 7 percent were in the middle-merit group. Similarly, 84 percent of those who completed a rigorous academic curriculum in high school were in the high-merit group, and 15 percent demonstrated middle-level academic merit. The average SAT score of students identified with low academic merit was 728, virtually none (0.2 percent) of the low-merit students had completed a rigorous academic curriculum, and 14 percent earned mostly As in high school (table 3b). In contrast, among those identified as achieving high-level academic merit, their average SAT score was 1192, more than one-half completed rigorous high school curricula (57 percent), and 84 percent earned mostly As in high school.  "}, {"section_title": "Financial Need", "text": "While family income and a student's financial need are highly related, they are not equivalent. Low-income students are not necessarily considered students with high need nor are middle-or high-income students always considered those with lesser need. Under federal need analysis methodology, the expected family contribution (EFC) is calculated using parent and student income, assets, and family size, among other factors. A student's need is calculated by subtracting the EFC from the total price of attendance, which is not only dependent on tuition and fees, but is also sensitive to the type of living arrangement a student chooses. Therefore, depending upon the amount of tuition and the cost of living, a student at one institution may have moderate or high financial need while at another he or she may have no need at all. At an institution that charges high tuition, middle-and higher-income students may have considerable need while at a school with low tuition, even low-income students may have little or no need. In this analysis, financial need is defined as the need remaining after both the EFC and federal and state grants were subtracted from the student budget.8 This remaining need is the amount a student would have to pay through loans, work, or other means. It is also the amount that institutions typically take into account before committing their own funds. After students' remaining need was determined, need amounts were divided into approximate quartiles (combining the middle two), separately for public and private not-forprofit institutions. However, in the public sector, about one-third of beginning students had no remaining financial need after subtracting the EFC and federal and state grant aid. This group formed the lowest need category (referred to as \"no need\") for students attending public institutions.

The average total need, including those with zero need, was about $3,600. The average financial need of those in the lowest income quartile was about $6,200, compared with about $900 for those in the highest income quartile.

The similarity in need between those in the low-and middle-income quartiles is partly due to differences in the average tuition they paid: with each successive income level, the average tuition increased.

In less selective institutions, students who had achieved high levels of academic merit in high school were more likely to receive institutional grant aid than those with lower levels of merit: roughly one-half (52 percent) of high-merit students, compared with roughly one-fifth of those with either middle (21 percent) or low (17 percent) levels of merit. In very selective institutions, on the other hand, there was no apparent linear association between academic merit and institutional aid receipt. Comparing less selective with very selective public institutions, students with high academic merit were more likely to receive institutional aid in less selective (52 percent) than in very selective institutions (27 percent), while the opposite occurred for low-merit students: those in very selective institutions were more likely to receive aid (35 percent) than in less selective institutions (17 percent). In both less selective and very selective public institutions, a relationship between financial need and institutional aid receipt was also evident. As levels of financial need rose, so did students' likelihood of receiving institutional grant aid. However, differences between less selective and very selective institutions were also observed. Students with no remaining financial need were more likely to receive institutional grant aid in less selective (16 percent) than in very selective institutions (9 percent), while the opposite was observed for students with high financial need: those in very selective institutions were more likely to receive aid (49 percent) than in less selective institutions (33 percent). Need by Merit Table 7a shows the patterns between financial need and institutional grant aid receipt for each level of academic merit. As was determined overall, within each level of merit, in less selective and very selective institutions, as students' financial need increased, so did their likelihood of receiving institutional grant aid. This was statistically confirmed for low-merit and middle-merit students in less selective institutions and for middle-merit and high-merit students in very selective institutions. There were too few cases of low-merit students in very selective institutions and the standard errors for high-merit students in less selective institutions were too large to determine an association between financial need and institutional receipt statistically. There were notable differences between less selective and very selective institutions. In particular, high-merit students with either no need (44 vs. 14 percent) or moderate need (52 vs. 23 percent) were more likely to receive institutional grant aid at less selective than very selective institutions.10\nThe average amount of institutional aid awarded as a percent of tuition at public institutions ranged from about two-thirds to nearly 100 percent (table 7b). However, the amounts tended to vary widely within given levels of merit and need. Therefore, only two statistical differences in amounts awarded could be detected in relation to students' financial need or academic merit. Both differences were determined for students enrolled in less selective institutions: among all aid recipients, those with high financial need received more aid as a percent of tuition (84 percent) than those with moderate need (67 percent). This difference was due primarily to the difference in aid amounts awarded to high-merit students, among whom, those with high financial need received enough aid to pay for 96 percent of their tuition, while those with moderate need received enough to pay for 64 percent of their tuition.\nIn less selective public institutions, both middle-merit and low-merit students who received institutional grant aid were more likely than their unaided counterparts to stay enrolled in their first year and less likely to have left postsecondary education (table 8a). For example, among middle-merit students, 87 percent of those who received aid had enrolled in their second year, compared with 75 percent of their unaided counterparts. The same pattern was not detected for high-merit students who attended less selective public institutions. In very selective public institutions, only high-merit aid recipients were more likely than their unaided counterparts to stay enrolled (97 percent vs. 90 percent); no difference in their transfer rates, however, could be detected statistically (3 percent and 7 percent, respectively).\nIn less selective public institutions, all aided students (whether low-, middle-, or highmerit) were more likely than their unaided counterparts to have attained a degree or to still be enrolled at the awarding institution (table 9a). In total, about two-thirds of aided students, compared with one-half of unaided students had done so. In very selective public institutions, on the other hand, this pattern was found only for high-merit students (88 vs. 78 percent). Table 8b. Percentage distribution of 1995-96 beginning full-time students in private not-for-profit 4-year institutions according to their enrollment status after their first year, by institutional grant aid receipt, high school academic merit, and financial need  When examining both merit and financial need simultaneously, small sample sizes and large standard errors precluded making some comparisons. Nevertheless, several patterns were detected. For example, in less selective public institutions, middle-merit aided students with moderate or high financial need and low-merit students with moderate need were more likely than their unaided counterparts to have attained a degree from, or to be enrolled at, the awarding institution 6 years after first starting. Specifically, 69 percent of middle-merit students with moderate financial need were enrolled or had attained a degree at the awarding institution, compared with 52 percent of their unaided counterparts. Comparable percentages for middlemerit students with high financial need are 79 and 55 percent. At very selective public institutions, virtually all (97 percent) high-merit students with no financial need who received institutional aid had attained a degree or were enrolled 6 years later at the awarding institution, compared with 80 percent of their unaided counterparts. While it appears as though high-merit students with high financial need also had higher retention rates than their unaided counterparts (82 vs. 73 percent), there was not enough statistical evidence to confirm the difference."}, {"section_title": "Need by Merit", "text": "Looking at patterns of institutional grant aid receipt for students in each level of academic merit (table 7a), what is clearly evident is that roughly 9-in-10 high-merit students enrolled in less selective private not-for-profit institutions received institutional aid, regardless of their financial need. Among low-merit and middle-merit students, on the other hand, institutional aid receipt increased with financial need. In very selective private not-for-profit institutions, the likelihood of receiving institutional grant aid was associated with students' financial need, even among high-merit students: as their financial need increased, so did their likelihood of receiving institutional grant aid from 20 percent of low-need, to 57 percent of moderate-need, to 64 percent of high-need students.

(See appendix B for a detailed description of the methodology used.) In particular, the analysis examined the association between institutional grant aid amounts as a percent of tuition received in the first year and 6-year retention rates at the awarding institution, taking into account the covariation of other independent variables such as financial need and academic merit. The main independent variable was the amount of institutional grant aid students received in their first year as a percent of tuition it covered.13 Because the amount needed to attend private not-for-profit institutions is considerably higher than the amount needed to attend comparable public institutions, the levels of institutional aid were necessarily different for the two sectors. For public institutions, the institutional aid levels were amounts that covered either less than 50 percent or 50 percent or more of tuition. For private not-for-profit institutions, the levels were amounts that covered 25 percent or less of tuition, 26-49 percent, 50-74 percent, and 75 percent or more. However, the comparison groupthose who received no institutional grant aidwas the same in both sectors. Other independent variables included levels of students' academic merit (middle and high vs. low), students' financial need (moderate and high vs. low), and institution selectivity (very selective vs. less selective). In addition, demographic and socioeconomic variables were taken into account, including gender, race/ethnicity, and parents' education.14 Because the financial need variable takes into account both income and federal and state grant aid, no other income or financial aid variables were included in the regressions. The analysis was 13In subsequent follow-up surveys, the amount of institutional aid was unknown. 14While the analysis controlled for observable student characteristics that might be related to persistence, it is possible that unobservable characteristics are related both to the receipt of institutional aid and persistence. For example, an institution might be more likely to give aid to students it perceives as more likely to succeed over students with comparable merit and need. done separately for public and private not-for-profit institutions and included only full-time students. The results for the public sector are shown in table 10a. The first column displays the unadjusted percentages, which are the percentages of full-time students who attained a degree at the awarding institution or were still enrolled 6 years after first beginning, before adjusting for the covariation of the independent variables in the model. Comparisons are made between the subgroup and the reference group (in italics), and all significant differences are designated with an asterisk. The second column displays the least squares coefficients expressed as percentages. Significant coefficients represent the observed differences that remain between the analysis group (such as those receiving certain amounts of institutional aid) and the comparison group (those receiving no institutional aid) after controlling for the relationships of all the selected independent variables. For example, in table 10a, the least squares coefficient for those who received enough institutional aid to cover 50 percent or more of tuition is 14.97. This means that compared to those who received no institutional aid, about 15 percent more of the aid recipients would be expected to maintain their enrollment or attain a degree at the awarding institution after controlling for the relationships with all the other independent variables. In public institutions, receiving institutional grant aid in the first year appeared to make a difference in whether students stayed enrolled at the awarding institution. Both levels of institutional aid amounts were related to higher 6-year retention rates, compared with receiving no institutional grant aid. That is, both those who received less than 50 percent of tuition and those who received more than that were more likely to earn a degree from or to be enrolled at the awarding institution than students who did not receive institutional aid in their first year after controlling for the relationships with the other variables. Results for private not-for-profit institutions are shown in table 10b. It appears as though students who received amounts of institutional aid that covered 75 percent or more of their tuition were more likely than unaided students to have attained a degree from or still be enrolled at the awarding institutions. However, after taking into consideration the covariation of students' academic merit, financial need, institutional selectivity, as well as other variables, the multivariate analysis failed to find a difference between aided and unaided students, regardless of the amount that aided students received. Other independent variables were associated with 6-year institutional retention rates in both sectors after controlling for the relationships with other variables. These variables were high school academic merit (both middle-and high-merit levels were more likely to stay enrolled than low-merit levels) and parents' education (those whose parents had no more than a high school Table 10a.

In the public sector, selectivity was also associated with institutional retention, but the same was not observed in private not-for-profit institutions. That is, in public colleges and universities, students in very selective institutions were more likely to stay enrolled than those in less selective institutions, while in the private not-for-profit sector, no differences in retention rates were detected between those in very selective and less selective institutions after taking into account the covariation of related variables. Finally, in both analyses, once related variables were taken into consideration, no differences in retention rates could be detected between aided and unaided students with respect to their gender, race/ethnicity, or levels of financial need. Using data from three administrations of the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:92, NPSAS:96, and NPSAS:2000), the analysis revealed a measurable increase in the percentage of full-time undergraduates in 4-year colleges and universities who received institutional aid over the last decade. In private not-for-profit institutions, increases in merit aid were especially notable over the latter period (between 1995-96 and 1999-2000), in particular for students in the highest income quartile. In 1995-96, 18 percent of high-income students in private not-for-profit institutions received an average of about $4,800 in institutional merit aid, while in 1999-2000, 29 percent received an average of $5,900. Corresponding estimates for lowincome students were 18 and 23 percent, respectively, who received merit aid, averaging roughly $4,300 and $4,100. The findings for private not-for-profit institutions also indicate that there may have been a shift away from favoring middle-income students with merit aid toward awarding comparable proportions of aid to middle-and high-income students. Specifically, in 1992-93 and 1995-96, middle-income students were more likely to receive merit aid than either low-or high-income students. By 1999-2000, no difference could be detected in the percentage of middle-and highincome students receiving merit aid-32 and 29 percent, respectively, did socompared with 23 percent of low-income students. Even though students in private not-for-profit institutions are the main recipients of institutional aidnearly 60 percent of full-time students received such aid in 1999 -2000 nearly one-quarter of their counterparts in public institutions also received institutional aid that year. Moreover, the percentage receiving merit-based aid increased from 7 percent to 10 percent between 1995-96 and 1999-2000. However, the likelihood of receiving merit aid in public institutions was not associated with family income in any of the three surveys analyzed. The study also analyzed data from a cohort of undergraduates who first enrolled in college in 1995-96 to determine how the receipt of institutional grant aid was related to students' high school academic merit, their financial need, and the institutions' selectivity. The data were further analyzed to ascertain whether institutional grant aid was related to students' likelihood of staying enrolled in the awarding institution. There were notable differences in the extent to which less selective and very selective institutions awarded institutional grant aid. Students who had achieved high academic merit in high school were much more likely to receive institutional grant aid in less selective institutions than in very selective institutions. This pattern was observed in both public and private not-forprofit institutions, though the percentages receiving aid were higher in the private sector. Roughly 9-in-10 high-merit students in less selective private not-for-profit institutions received institutional grant aid in 1995-96, with no differences detected across income quartiles. In very selective institutions, on the other hand, high-merit students with high financial need were much more likely to receive institutional grant aid than their counterparts with low (or no) financial need. The analysis also produced evidence that the receipt of institutional grant aid in less selective institutions was related to higher 1-year college retention rates for some students, particularly for those who had achieved moderate levels of high school academic merit. These students were more likely to return to the awarding institution in their second year than students with comparable merit who did not receive institutional grant aid. This finding held in both public and private not-for-profit sectors. In very selective institutions, on the other hand, a difference in 1-year retention rates between aided and unaided students could only be detected for high-merit students in public institutions. The analysis also detected an association between receiving institutional grant aid in their first year and the likelihood of students either attaining a degree from or being enrolled in the awarding institution 6 years later in public institutions. This was particularly the case for middlemerit students with moderate and high levels of financial need. In other words, those who received institutional grants in public institutions in their first year were more likely than their unaided counterparts to earn a degree from or still be enrolled in the awarding institution. Similar results, however, could not be detected for those enrolled in private not-for-profit institutions. The findings for long-term retention rates of students at the awarding institution also held in a multivariate analysis, which took into account the intercorrelation of related variables such as students' academic merit, financial need, and demographic characteristics and the selectivity of institutions. In other words, students in public institutions who received institutional aid in their first year were more likely than their unaided counterparts to receive a degree from or still be enrolled in the awarding institution 6 years after their initial enrollment even after taking into consideration these variables. The same was not detected for those in private not-for-profit institutions. Taken together, the results are consistent with those of other studies reporting increases in spending by 4-year colleges and universities on institutional aid (e.g., Cunningham et al. 2001), especially by less selective institutions (Redd 2000;Hubbell and Lapovsky 2002). The findings also indicated that in the late 1990s, the percentage of high-income students receiving institutional grant aid increased, as did the average amount they received. This study could not address whether institutional grant aid awards had increased the enrollment of the types of students that institutions sought. However, the findings did indicate that in private not-for-profit institutions, where most institutional grant aid is awarded, no obvious association could be detected between students' receipt of institutional grant aid in their first year and their persistence at the awarding institution until degree attainment, once other factors such as students' academic merit, their financial need, and institutional selectivity were taken into consideration.
