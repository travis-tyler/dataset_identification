[{"section_title": "I. Measuring the Output of U.S. Dairy Farms", "text": "Dairy producers whose processors participate in the Federal Milk Marketing Order (FMMO) and California fluid milk programs are faced with minimum milk value being based on milk solids density i.e., multiple-component pricing (MCP) system. A substantial proportion of minimum milk price depends on the valuation milk fat, protein, and other dairy solids contained in one hundred pounds of milk along with how the milk is used in the marketing orders. In other words, one hundred pounds of milk (e.g., a cwt) may have different values due to variations in components across farms, even for farms that sell their raw milk to the same processor. These component values are derived from wholesale manufactured dairy product prices whose yields are highly dependent on these components. The products used to determine component values include cheddar cheese, butter, nonfat dry milk and dry whey. The exact method used to determine minimum milk value depends on the product for which the raw milk is used as an input (Jesse and Cropp, 2008). Since milk component composition determines milk value, these components and their anticipated values should be part of any examination of production decisions/outcomes observed for U.S. dairy farms. Many factors can affect milk composition, such as cattle breed, seasonality, number of previous lactations the cow has been in the milking herd, the number of times per day a cow is milked and feeding/ration decisions (Manchester and Blayney, 2001). In addition, genetic selection has had a significant impact on milk composition (Roibas and Alvarez, 2012). In 2012, average annual milk production for Holstein cows contained in the Dairy Herd Improvement Association (DHIA) data base was estimated to be 23,385 pounds while the Jersey breed yield was estimated to be 16,997 pounds (Kasbergen, 2013). In contrast to the total weight of milk produced, a Jersey cow typically has higher levels of milk components. The average percentage of fat and protein for Holsteins is 3.8% and 3.1%, respectively whereas Jersey cattle averaged 4.8% and 3.7% (Capper and Cady, 2012). In other words, when making production decisions, farmers may tradeoff between physical yield and the amount of milk solids. Besides impacting milk composition by the breed choice, in the long-run producers can also adjust management practices like the choice of feed. The simulation results from Bailey (2005) indicate that nutritional change can alter the percentage of fat by 1%. This is especially significant for herds that are below average in fat content. 1 Therefore, the total amount milk produced and the production of fat, protein and other solids are important factors influencing the allocation of inputs across dairy farm enterprise. Previous evaluations of dairy farm productivity have typically used the volume of raw milk as the output measure without adjusting this physical quantity for differences in component yields. It is our contention that ignoring the true source of milk value will lead to the misspecification of any productivity evaluation. For instance, assume we have two farmers who use exactly the same amount of inputs to produce the same amount of milk by weight, but one farmer produces milk with higher density of components for whatever reason. Due to the component pricing of raw milk, farmers with higher component levels per cwt of milk will receive higher revenue than the producer whose milk has lower component amounts. The traditional method of estimating technical efficiency is not able incorporate this output difference caused by variable quality, i.e., component amounts. The bottom line is that the effective milk output measure should depend on not only on weight of the milk produced but also on the attributes of this milk. For this analysis we adjust our output measure by controlling for milk composition. This standardization makes it possible to adjust our productivity measurement based on milk quality not just quantity. Our objective of incorporating milk quality as a factor in milk output is to gain the unbiased estimation of a dairy operation's technical efficiency. To do so, we use hedonic functions to generate an aggregate output index with explicit incorporation of production of multiple components and then apply it to an input-oriented distance function to estimate dairy farm technical efficiency. An application of our multi-output efficiency analysis is illustrated by our use of the 2005 USDA Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS)-Dairy Survey database. A unique feature of that year's ARMS data is that it contains information on milkfat and protein produced, which allows us to obtain the production of milk component composition. 3 When correcting for unobserved prices and demand shocks, the estimated technical efficiency has less variance, but larger range. More producers have efficiency greater than 0.9 when compared to the most efficient producers. This analysis improves upon previous studies in several respects. From a methodical perspective, we use an aggregated hedonic function to generate an output index from multiple milk components. To our knowledge, such an analysis has not been undertaken for the U.S. dairy industry. A translog functional form is used as the basis of the hedonic function, which allows endogenous weights to differ between components produced. In terms of data, the ARMS data set contains detailed information of milk component production and input use specific to the dairy enterprise. Compared to analyses of productivity with quality-adjustment for other kinds of products, milk production has the advantage that we can identify all the attributes that affect the value of milk, since the multiple-component pricing system provides comprehensive indexes for evaluating milk quality. That is, we can create a standardized milk output of milk by controlling for difference of these components. In Section 2 of this paper, the theoretical model of a multiple output distance function is developed. In Section 3, we provide an overview of the data used in the analysis. Section 4 is used to specify the empirical model and presents the empirical result. Finally, our conclusions and suggestions for future research are presented in 5 Section 5."}, {"section_title": "II. How Can We Measure Technical Efficiency in Milk Component Production?", "text": "We use an input-oriented distance function to evaluate the technical efficiency of a sample of U.S. dairy farms. In the derivation of our technical efficiency measure we employ a hedonic output aggregator function to generate an output index with explicit incorporation of production of multiple components. The method we use allows us to estimate the parameters of the output aggregator simultaneously with the parameters of the distance function."}, {"section_title": "The Hedonic Aggregator Function", "text": "Hedonic aggregator functions are used to create an aggregator of effective outputs of a multiple product firm. The hedonic aggregate output function used in this analysis can be represented via the following: Where y is a vector of M outputs. To allow for the data to determine the exact shape of the aggregator function, we specify the function \uf079(\uf0d7) to be translog with respect to levels of components produced. This functional form was used by Kumbhakar and Hjalmarsson (1998) in their analysis of the electricity retail sector. This functional form is flexible and allows estimated coefficients to represent the relative weight of each output. For parameter identification purposes, we must impose parameter restriction. We assume the hedonic aggregate function to be symmetric ( ) and homogenous of degree one (\u2211 1 and \u2211 0 for \u2200 ) with respect to outputs. For hedonic aggregate function with two outputs (M=2), the restrictions can be specified as follows: Hence, only two parameters ( and ) need to be estimated to figure out the hedonic function. This specification will be applied in the empirical estimation section. 6"}, {"section_title": "The Input Distance Function", "text": "Parametric and non-parametric distance functions are widely used when measuring technical efficiency due to their general ability to the distance function concept can be applied to multi-input or multi-output production technologies. In this analysis we define the input distance function as the maximum amount by which the input vector could be radially reduced while remaining feasible to produce a given amount of output vector (Coelli, Rao and O'Donnell, 1998).  is the percentage of input overused in order to produce a given amount of output. We can define the technical Imposing the assumption that , is homogenous of degree 1 in input x, we obtain: and N is the number of inputs. We can represent the parametric distance function via the translog functional form. The stochastic version of this distance function with N inputs and M outputs can be represented via the following: Where \uf065=v-u. u and v are error terms. We assume error term ui is independently and truncated normally distributed with mean \uf068 and variance , ui~N + (\uf068i,\u03c3u 2 ). Following the method used by Battese and Coelli (1995), we set \uf068i=\uf064Zi, where Zi is a vector of exogenous explanatory variables associated with technical efficiency. \uf064 is a set of parameters to be estimated. The system noise error term vi has the following distribution: \u223c 0, . We also assume the error terms ui and vi are independent. When we incorporate hedonic aggregate output function as one of the outputs into the distance function, we obtain the following: Where \u03c8(y) is aggregate output from milk components and yr is output of revenue from livestock. Four inputs are incorporated, which will be specified in the following section."}, {"section_title": "Specification of Maximum Likelihood Estimation", "text": "Equation (1) and (6) are estimated simultaneously via the use of maximum likelihood (ML) methods.

Description of Dairy Farm Data", "text": "Our objective is to examine the productivity characteristics of U.S. dairy farms using the above modeling framework. We use the 2005 USDA Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS)-Dairy Component for our analysis. The ARMS survey contains data on a nationally representative sample of U.S. dairy farms. It contains information about farm and operator characteristics, cost, returns, production and management activities (Dubman, 2000). A unique feature of the 2005 survey was that that it was collected with respect to total annual milk production but also the average component composition of that production. The presence of these measures of output enables us to generate an output index from multiple milk components. Variables used in the estimation are listed in table 1. In the estimation of milk production technical efficiency, we employ three outputs measures (fat yield, protein yield and revenue from cattle sales) and four inputs measures (labor, feed, capital cost and other variable cost). Pasture-based dairy production has advantage in reducing feed cost and negative effect on milk yield (Dong, 2013), hence we incorporate a dummy variable for pasture-based dairy system, pasture25, which is 1 when the total forage ration from pasture during the grazing months is more than 25% and takes value 0 otherwise. Variables for production regions are also adopted. Eight farm production regions 4 are classified, which is specified in figure 1. Hence, we incorporate seven dummy variables for the production regions. We notice that the size of dairy farms has significant variability across different production regions. Table 2 and table 3   There are more regional variances in the management practices of dairy production. For instance, adoption of technologies like milking seasonal dry-off varies from 0.0987 in Lake State to 0.7509 in Southern Plains. The use of udder washer is only 1.26% for Lake State, while for Pacific area is 61.14%. Those differences may contribute to the variation in technical efficiencies, which we will discuss later in this paper."}, {"section_title": "IV. Technical Efficiency of U.S. Dairy Farms", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Estimation of Dairy Farm Distance Functions", "text": "We estimate the input distance function (eq. 6), which contains the hedonic aggregate function (eq. 1) whose value is used as our output measure. The parameters of the hedonic and input density functions are estimated simultaneously. The resulting parameter estimates are shown in Table 6. A majority of the parameters in the input distance function are statistically significant. In the hedonic function, the statistically significant coefficient for milkfat is 0.653 with standard error 0.252. Given the hedonic function symmetry and homogeneity restrictions, we can derive the parameter for protein is 0.347, for interaction term of fat and protein is -0.627 and for quadratic term of protein is 0.313 5 ."}, {"section_title": "Evaluation of Technical Efficiency", "text": "To compare our results with conventional methods of measuring technical efficiency, we estimate the input distance function using another two sets of outputs: (1) amount of milk yield (cwt/cow) and revenue from cattle ($/cow); (2) revenue from milk ($/cow) and revenue from cattle ($/cow). The mean technical efficiency for the entire sample is 0.870 with a standard deviation of 0.074. Figure 3.1 is used to show the empirical distributions of technical efficiency. There is a significant right skewness of the efficiency values. We also estimate the kernel density for each herd size group and production region and present the results in Figures 3.2 and Figures 3.3. Table 7 is used to present a summary of the results of our technical efficiency measures by herd size. Farms with large number of milking herds tends to be more efficient. The minimum value of technical efficiency for farms with more than 750 cows is 0.924 and with a standard deviation is 0.009 which means that almost all large farms are relatively technical efficient in the sample. Farms with small scales have more variability in their technical efficiency measure. State and Southern, the difference is not significant. We conduct the logit model in the next section to investigate the influencing factors for the difference in the three methods."}, {"section_title": "V. Conclusion and Discussion", "text": "Farm milk is a differentiated product given that its solids concentration is what determines value. That is, a cwt of milk produced by two dairy farms located next to each other whose milk is sold to the same processing plant could have substantially different value if their milks' component compositions differ. As such, we incorporate milk quality (i.e. fat and protein composition) as a factor in milk output to obtain an estimate of the technical efficiency measures for the products that determine production value. We use hedonic functions to generate aggregate output indices with explicit incorporation of the above two components. We then use an input-oriented distance function to estimate dairy farm technical efficiency. An application of the above analysis We find in this paper that when adopting the multi-output method, the mean of technical efficiency is 0.87, with standard deviation 0.074. Technical efficiency was found to vary by size of the dairy herd as well as across regions. Farms with larger sized herds tends to be more efficient. Dairy farms with more than 750 cows were estimated to have an average technical efficiency of 0.92 and with a standard deviation 0.009. thus we find that almost all relatively large dairy farms are efficient compared to smaller operations. Dairy farms located in the Pacific region had the highest average efficiency rated compared to the Corn Belt which was found to be relatively inefficient. This result is obviously related to the observed herd size differences. The above analysis is a first pass at trying to obtain a better understanding of dairy farm efficiency. We plan on undertaking the following activities: \uf0b7 Incorporate additional output categories: In this analysis, we only account for the production of milk components and revenue from livestock as dairy farm outputs. Crop revenue will also be added to the list of output categories. Because of the existence of over order volume premiums we should also add the cwt of milk produced as an output. \uf0b7 Account for Off-Farm Income. It is well known that income from off-farm employment can represent a significant proportion of dairy farm household income. We will expand the outputs to include off-farm income. This changes the technical efficiency focus from the dairy farm to the dairy farm household. \uf0b7 Update and Improve data quality: In the 2005 ARMS data, the breed of cows used on dairy farm was not collected. Breed selection is critical when examining the per cwt value of milk and associated components. We need to incorporate breed information into the model in some manner such a variable impacting feed productivity. The year 2005 was only 5 years after Federal Order Reform. This short time period and the lifecycle of a typical dairy cow may mean that the dairy sector had not fully adjusted to the structural change represented by these reforms. If that is the case, then using more current data will provide more accurate estimates of dairy farm efficiency under the new FMMO milk pricing system.    "}]
