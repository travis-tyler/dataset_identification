Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) yields quantitative measures sensitive to brain development and degeneration, and some common genetic variants may be associated with white matter integrity or connectivity. DTI measures, such as the fractional anisotropy (FA) of water diffusion, may be useful for identifying genetic variants that influence brain microstructure. However, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) require large populations to obtain sufficient power to detect and replicate significant effects, motivating a multi-site consortium effort. As part of an ENIGMA-DTI working group, we analyzed high-resolution FA images from multiple imaging sites across North America, Australia, and Europe, to address the challenge of harmonizing imaging data collected at multiple sites. Four hundred images of healthy adults aged 18-85 from four sites were used to create a template and corresponding skeletonized FA image as a common reference space. Using twin and pedigree samples of different ethnicities, we used our common template to evaluate the heritability of tract-derived FA measures.

The degree of heritability, as well as the effects of specific genetic variants, can be mapped using quantitative genetic analysis of measures derived from brain images (Chen et al., 2012; Glahn et al., 2010; Thompson et al., 2001; van den Heuvel et al., 2013) . Specific genetic variants affecting cognition or disease risk have been hard to identify as their individual effects are small, leaving much of the genetic effect unaccounted for, leading to \"missing heritability\" (Zuk et al., 2012) . Instead of relating clinical or behavioral measures to variants in the genome, imaging genetics offers a direct approach to discover genetic variants that affect brain structure and function. In this context, brain imaging measures can be considered quantitative endophenotypes for neurological or psychiatric illness, and identifying genetic variants associated with these measures provides candidates for disease risk (Braskie et al., 2011b; Glahn et al., 2007; Hasler and Northoff, 2011) . The current manuscript focuses on the genetic properties of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) (Basser et al., 1994) , a relatively less utilized data type in imaging genomics.\nAs MRI-based studies of the brain expanded to include hundreds or even thousands of subjects, it recently became feasible to search the genome for single-base-pair alterations, or polymorphisms, that are related to identifiable features in brain scans. Recent publications from the Enhancing Neuroimaging Genetics though Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA) and Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) Consortia, highlight the potential of large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) -especially metaanalyses of multiple studies -to uncover genetic loci associated with MRI-based phenotypes including hippocampal volumes (Bis et al., 2012; Stein et al., 2012) , intracranial volumes Stein et al., 2012) , and head circumference . However, currently these large-scale imaging genomics efforts have been primarily restricted to phenotypes/endophenotypes derived from T1-weighted gray matter images. Recently, we created the ENIGMA Consortium DTI working group to examine the genetic influences on white matter micro-architecture and integrity, assessed using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). The goal of the ENIGMA-DTI working group is to identify and homogenize heritable phenotypes that can be reliably obtained from images collected with a wide array of imaging parameters and from subjects of varying ages and different ethnicities. Eventually, we hope to discover specific genetic variants influencing brain DTI. As an initial step towards this goal, it is critical to determine which brain regions and measures to prioritize, based on how consistently they can be measured, and the relative evidence for substantial and consistent genetic influences on them (i.e., heritability).\nOne of several commonly analyzed scalar maps extracted from DTI (Basser et al., 1994 ) -the fractional anisotropy (FA) (Basser and Pierpaoli, 1996) -evaluates the extent to which water diffusion is directionally constrained by white matter microstructure. FA reflects fiber coherence, myelination levels, and axonal integrity, and has been widely used as an index of white matter integrity (Thomason and Thompson, 2011) . As might be expected, FA shows diffuse abnormalities in many brain disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD) (Clerx et al., 2012; Teipel et al., 2012) , it is related to cognitive performance (Penke et al., 2010a (Penke et al., , 2010b and it is altered in numerous psychiatric disorders including major depressive disorder (Carballedo et al., 2012) , bipolar disorder (Barysheva et al., 2013; Sprooten et al., 2011a) , and schizophrenia Mandl et al., 2012) .\nThe heritability of FA mapped voxel-wise in the brain, or averaged within specific tracts, has previously been established independently in various cohorts and also for different ethnic groups (Brouwer et al., 2010; Chiang et al., 2011b; Kochunov et al., 2011b) . A meta-analysis of neuroimaging measures has found that FA is heritable with relatively tight confidence intervals, making it extremely promising for further genetic study (Blokland et al., 2012) . More recently, DTI measures have begun to be used as phenotypes for genome-wide association and linkage studies Jahanshad et al., 2012a; Kochunov et al., 2011b; Lopez et al., 2012; Sprooten et al., 2012) in the quest to identify novel variants and molecular pathways associated with white matter microstructure. While these gene discovery studies have great potential, single-site studies have limited power to discover variants that reliably generalize to other cohorts. Indeed, GWAS findings are often site-specific and may not be replicated in other populations. If the same cohort is imaged with different scanning protocols or analyzed with different processing streams, there may be differences in the sets of variants that are declared to be significant (Jahanshad et al., 2012c) . Replication studies and meta-analyses across various independent study cohorts and imaging protocols are therefore vital to identify true positives that are robustly associated with a brain measure.\nBefore we undertake the task of a GWAS-meta analysis (GWAS-MA) across sites with FA measures, we must first decide on a set of phenotypes that can be reliably derived from the images. Even with rigorous quality control procedures, inter-site measurement variability can be quite high, with adverse effects for multi-site studies (Zhu et al., 2011) . To be a useful endophenotype for GWAS, phenotypes must show high levels of heritability regardless of the population under study. Heritability is defined as the proportion of the trait variance in a population that is attributable to genetic factors. While there is no guarantee that GWAS will find specific genetic variants that influence highly heritable traits, non-heritable measures are unlikely to be useful for gene discovery. In this context, phenotype prioritization will focus studies and make them more efficient. As the goal of phenotypic prioritization is to reduce the number of traits tested in GWAS, the correction for multiple testing is reduced, improving the potential to identify genes.\nHere, we use FA images from four different imaging cohorts, scanned at various resolutions, and with different population structures, to develop a high-resolution target for image registration in the ICBM/MNI space, in accordance with previously established white matter atlases (Mori et al., 2008) . We provide the FA-based registration target and white matter skeleton along with a set of protocols for effective collaboration in multi-site meta-analytical studies, including GWAS-MA (provided online at http://enigma.loni.ucla.edu/ongoing/dti-workinggroup/). After processing 5 datasets with this protocol, we perform heritability analysis on a voxel-wise level with a subset of the datasets. These analyses were a meta-analysis of DTI data from 1) a Caucasian (Australian) twin sample and 2) a Mexican-American pedigree to converge on the most reliably heritable features and regions in the image. Large meta-analytic studies have been widely used to estimate the genetic influence of behavioral traits (Bezdjian et al., 2011; Malouff et al., 2008) , and to reveal the genetic complexity of disease (Sullivan et al., 2003) . This work presented here is the first of its kind, as it harmonizes images from different cohorts into the same high-resolution stereotaxic space and performs voxel-wise meta-analytical tests of heritability along the white matter skeleton, and in the image space. We additionally examine a mega-analytical approach, 2 in an effort to boost power to estimate the heritability.\nWe further estimate this heritability on parcellations of the image for a more traditional assessment of regional estimates of heritability, in regions of interest. This work from the ENIGMA-DTI working group lays the foundation to select phenotypes for large future multi-site joint-analytic genetic association studies with DTI data."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study subjects and imaging protocols", "text": "Four datasets described below (QTIM, GOBS, BFS, LBC1936; the acronyms are also detailed below) were used for template creation.

FA images from all subjects were aligned, using FSL's 'flirt' (Jenkinson et al., 2002) , to the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) DTI atlas in ICBM space (ICBM-DTI-81 white matter labels atlas) (Mori et al., 2008) available with the FSL package to ensure spatial consistency. A target was created as previously described (Kochunov et al., 2001 (Kochunov et al., , 2002 from these aligned images. Briefly, FA images from the 100 subjects of each cohort were iteratively registered with nonlinear registration (Andersson et al., 2008) to create a custom mean atlas, using a target ICBM space defined by the JHU DTI atlas (ICBM-DTI-81 white-matter labels atlas) (Mori et al., 2008) .

Non-linear spatial registration methods iteratively calculate the parameters of a deformation field from the coarse-to-fine resolution scales and the use of the custom template reduces some sources of bias in this normalization process (Kochunov et al., 2001) . To assess the closeness of the template to the individual data being aligned to it, the average deformation across all voxels was calculated for all subjects in each cohort for registration to each template. The degree of deformation at each voxel was quantified as the absolute value of the difference between the determinant of the deformation field Jacobian matrix (simply referred to as the Jacobian here) and unity, as one represents no volumetric change (although there may still be deformations, in an incompressible flow). This may be written as:\nJacobian matrix at voxel v, from a total of N v voxels, and k represents each cohort. Mean deformations to the templates were compared for each cohort.\nTract-based spatial statistics with reference to a common template\nAs described in the seminal tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) paper (Smith et al., 2006) , our template FA image was \"skeletonized\" to reveal an estimated structural core of the white matter.

These factors may be further broken down into additive versus dominant sources of genetic influence, as well as shared versus unique environmental influences on the trait of interest. We carried out our heritability studies using the full GOBS pedigree sample, and the paired-twin subsample of the QTIM, i.e., not including singletons or non-twin siblings."}, {"section_title": "Heritability calculation using SOLAR", "text": "To take into account the more complex structure of the GOBS pedigree, a variance components method, as implemented in the Sequential Oligogenic Linkage Analysis Routines (SOLAR) software package (http://www.nitrc.org/projects/se_linux) (Almasy and Blangero, 1998) was used. For comparison and combinatory purposes, the same analysis was also performed for the QTIM twin sample. Methods used to calculate heritability in SOLAR are detailed elsewhere Winkler et al., 2010) .\nBriefly, the algorithms in SOLAR employ maximum likelihood variance decomposition methods and are an extension of the strategy developed by (Amos, 1994) . The covariance matrix \u03a9 for a pedigree of individuals is given by the following:\nwhere \u03c3 g 2 is the genetic variance due to the additive genetic factors, \u03a6 is the kinship matrix representing the pair-wise kinship coefficients among all individuals, \u03c3 e 2 is the variance due to individual-specific environmental effects, and I is an identity matrix. In this model heritability is\nwhere \u03c3 2 P refers to the phenotypic variance. The variance parameters are estimated by comparing the observed phenotypic covariance matrix with the covariance matrix predicted by kinship (Almasy and Blangero, 1998) . Significance of heritability is tested by comparing the likelihood of the model in which \u03c3 g 2 is constrained to zero with that of a model in which \u03c3 g 2 is estimated.\nTwice the difference between the two log e likelihoods of these models yields a test statistic, which is asymptotically distributed as a 1/2:1/2 mixture of a \u03c7 2 variable with 1 degree-of-freedom and a point mass at zero. Prior to testing for the significance of heritability, phenotype values for each individual were adjusted for covariates including sex, age, age 2 , age \u00d7 sex interaction, and age 2 \u00d7 sex interaction.

To obtain our mean meta-analyzed heritability (h 2 ) and standard error measurements, here we chose to employ two methods: 1) Weight the heritability from each study by its sample size as was previously shown to be successful (Verweij et al., 2010) in twin studies. The mean heritability weighted by sample size (Sutton, 2000) is:\nfor v = 1 to N v -the total number of voxels along the skeleton, or the total number of ROIs; subscripts 1 and 2 refer to the two datasets used in this analysis. 2) Weight the heritability from each study by the heritability standard error, as extracted from the variance component model of Solar.

A mega-analysis program developed for the SOLAR (Blangero et al., 2005) computer package was implemented on the LONI Pipeline infrastructure (Dinov et al., 2010) for mega-analysis of heritability on both a voxelwise and an ROI level. Meta-analysis approaches fit separate models, while a mega-analysis fits a single model that allows certain parameters to be shared over datasets. Thus, especially for combining a small number of datasets, the mega-analysis approach may be more efficient, though necessarily makes more assumptions. Primarily, we assume that the pattern of inheritance of the trait is similar among the populations. We then force the phenotype to have the same distribution for each population. In the mega-analysis, we specifically test that the degree of shared genetic variance is not different between populations before combining them. To do this, we fit the model separately first for each cohort and test for the difference in the heritability values. A joint pedigree structure was produced by merging the kinship matrices for QTIM and GOBS cohorts. For each of the cohorts, a model was fitted including adjustment for covariates and finding the inverse normal transformation of the traits. Individual cohort heritability estimates can be obtained and using the full pedigree structure and the normalized FA values, a joint heritability estimate can be obtained."}, {"section_title": "Region of interest (ROI) extraction", "text": "Regions of interest were parcellated from the ENIGMA target in ICBM space according to the multi-subject JHU white matter parcellation atlas described by Mori et al.

For heritability analysis, in some cases, we joined together several regions of the same tract. This was done to aggregate data from regions expected to behave in a relatively homogeneous way, and to avoid analyzing very small regions, which may suffer from various levels of partial voluming depending on the imaging protocol.\nFor example, the internal capsule is comprised of the left and right anterior limb, posterior limb, and retrolenticular parts of the internal capsule, as defined in the atlas. An overall mask was created from all these regions and the average FA value within this entire mask was considered to be the average value within the full bilateral region.

FDR is a more lenient measure, controlling the average proportion of false positives among the detected voxels or ROIs, whereas FWE is more specific (but less powerful), controlling the chance any false positive voxels or ROIs. We report FDR-corrected significances for both voxel-wise and ROI analyses. FWE inferences that account for dependence between tests that require permutation methods (Nichols and Hayasaka, 2003) were also conducted on the ROI data.\nPermutation inference must be performed in a way that takes into account the dependence in the data. For the twin sample, the null hypothesis of no heritability allows randomly exchanging the MZ and DZ labels on twin pairs (twins pairs are kept intact, to control for common environmental effects).

The heritability result of the meta-analysis weighted by the sample size follows closely the distribution of the GOBS sample, as is expected as the sample size is much larger. The mega-analysis shows greater heritability overall. Fig. 7 plots the voxelwise correlation between the two types of analyses for both heritability estimate and significance values. Despite differences in the magnitude of both sets of values, we find that the voxelwise correlation between the two methods is extremely high (0.88 for N weighted and 0.89 for SE weighted).\nIn order to adjust our analyses for multiple testing and the likelihood of false positives from over 100,000 voxelwise tests performed on the white matter skeleton, we use the false discovery rate (FDR) procedure, as described in the Methods. We plot the cumulative distribution function of the sorted p-values from the variance component heritability tests from both individual cohorts as well as both the meta-and mega-analyses to show the relative effect size of each cohort and analysis in Fig. 8 . The cumulative distribution function (cdf) of the p-values is plotted against the null expected p-values. If the distribution follows the identity (dotted line, y = x), then the data are consistent with noise. If the curve exceeds y = 20x (i.e., y = x/0.05, to control FDR at 5%; solid black line), then the distribution of p-values is significant according to the false discovery rate procedure. The FDR-critical p-value is the point at which the curve crosses the y = 20x line. The closer the FDR critical p-value is to 0.05 (the higher it is), the greater the proportion of the image that can be claimed to have significant heritability while ensuring the false positive rate is maintained at 0.05.

The majority of regions, for all analyses, show high levels of heritability between 0.4 and 0.8. The trend of the meta-analyses weighted by the sample size follows closely that of the GOBS sample, which is expected as GOBS has a much larger sample size. However, the meta-analysis weighted by the standard error is a better medium between the two samples, as the smaller twin design has added power for estimating heritability. The superior longitudinal fasciculus, the external capsule, the corona radiata, and the body of the corpus callosum reliably show high levels of heritability. The corticospinal tract and fornix regions are the least heritable overall. This can be expected as both are rather small and can be difficult to register appropriately. The significance of the heritability of these regions is listed in Table 5 for each cohort and for the meta and mega analyses. 1000 permutations for the data in each cohort were also performed to obtain a null distribution on the heritability and significance estimates on the individual cohorts and the mega-analysis. Note that 1000 permutations lead to a minimum possible p-value of 0.001. According to permutation results, the most significantly heritable regions were the genu, body, and splenium of the corpus callosum, the superior longitudinal fasciculus, the sagittal stratum, and the corona radiata all at p b 0.005. As a further exploration of a general factor of FA, we performed a factor analysis of all regions of interest and estimated the per-cohort and overall heritability. The heritability for the GOBS cohort was h 2 = 0.36 (SE = 0.08), for QTIM h 2 = 0.59 (SE = 0.07), the SE-weighted meta-analysis was therefore h 2 = 0.45, and the mega-analyzed heritability estimate was h 2 = 0.55 (p b 1 \u00d7 10\n), suggesting that the general FA factor heritability is not as high as examining specific localized regions."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The protocol harmonization work presented here aims to serve as a foundation for multi-site meta-analytic studies with a focus on diffusion tensor neuroimaging genetics. Our analysis had several main results: 1) We created a publicly available FA template composed of images from 4 sites, each of which included 50 male and 50 female subjects ranging from age 18 to 85. These sites differed in study population and imaging protocols, although all diffusion imaging protocols had relatively high spatial and directional resolution.\n2) We showed the usefulness and practicality of our pipeline for multi-site imaging-genetics studies by computing heritability voxelwise along the FA-skeleton from two datasets, allowing us to find moderate correlations between heritability in two datasets different in family structure, ethnicity, and image acquisition. 3) Our meta-analysis weighted by the standard error was more accurate and less biased than one weighted by the sample size in this situation, suggesting that a meta-analysis of gene effects may show promise for future studies. 4) We partitioned the images into white matter regions of interest based on the JHU white matter atlas and found tracts and regions with corresponding high levels of heritability to rank regional phenotypes from FA images. 5) We made our template and its skeletonized FA map available to the public and provide protocols for worldwide meta-analysis, so that groups at any site can harmonize scans for readily extendible meta-analytical applications of brain mapping (http://enigma. loni.ucla.edu/ongoing/dti-working-group/), with explicit promise for imaging genetic studies.\nAs voxelwise and skeleton-wise analyses require that all images be registered to a common space, we registered all our images to both our template and the existing JHU template to observe the differences in the amount of overall deformation. As expected and shown in Table 1 , all datasets require, on average, less overall deformations when being registered to the ENIGMA-DTI template as compared to the current standard multi-subject DTI-FA template. Despite improvements in registration, our template is not meant to alter anatomic localization of existing tract regions of interest. In fact, we showed here that there is no statistical difference in the heritability (h 2 values, standard errors, or significance) in the regions of interest when either template is used. Therefore, results from previous studies using the current standard template could still be valid using this template, yet due to the large sample size and high resolution images used to obtain the ENIGMA-DTI-FA template, we predict it would allow for a wider variety of cohorts to map their individual data to the standard space with less variability and registration error. Much effort has been dedicated to understanding the sources of variability in multi-site DTI studies and developing harmonized protocols using clinical or phantom data , or both (Teipel et al., 2011; Zhan et al., 2012) . These efforts are of high value when starting new large multicenter imaging studies and can help identify outliers or problems at scan sites before the analysis is underway. However, these efforts are only applicable for data that has yet to be acquired and, despite the projected size of the study, will still be only limited to that study itself. Some multicenter studies, such as the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, or ADNI , harmonized their image acquisition protocols at the outset, but a far larger sample can be amassed if data can be combined from multiple studies that were initially planned and performed independently. Our harmonization scheme here is intended to complement such efforts after data has already been collected, so that study groups can compare, contrast and meta-analyze various DTI-based analyses in the same space. One of the most pressing and fundamental aspects of all scientific research is the ability to reproduce and replicate findings, as consistently replicated results are the only way to guarantee true positives in scientific research. This is particularly clear in the search for genetic associations to traits.\nThere are also genetic correlations, i.e. a common proportion of variance that two traits share because of common genetic influences -between FA and other traits such as intellectual performance (Chiang et al., 2009) or cerebrovascular measures (Kochunov et al., 2011a; Jahanshad et al., 2012b) . Due to this, FA may be a promising target for genetic analyses but may also be used to identify genetic variants with pleiotropic relations to disease. Additionally, there is some evidence that FA is altered in groups of individuals with genetic variants that may put them at higher risk for certain brain diseases. FA differences are found in carriers of common variants in genes associated with neurodegeneration such as APOE (Honea et al., 2009; Jahanshad et al., 2012d; Westlye et al., 2012) , CLU (Braskie et al., 2011a) , HFE (Jahanshad et al., 2012b) , as well as genes associated with psychiatric disorders including BDNF (Chiang et al., 2011a; Carballedo et al., 2012) , DISC1 (Sprooten et al., 2011b) , neuregulin and neurotrophin-related genes McIntosh et al., 2008; Zuliani et al., 2011) and several others. Several of these variants may even be combined to help predict FA in young normal adults (Kohannim et al., 2012) .\nHere, we use two datasets, a Caucasian twin sample, and a large Mexican-American pedigree, to individually and jointly analyze the heritability in order to narrow down regions of the image where we might expect a meta-analytical GWAS study to help discover new genetic loci influencing brain structure and potential risk for disease.\nWhereas heritability is considered a property of the population under study, and may not be appropriately meaningful as a single parameter estimate across various populations, our meta-analytic efforts here are designed to map brain regions that are heritable in different populations despite variability in population ethnicity, structure, and variations due to image acquisition. Meta-analytic approaches as described above have been successful in narrowing down trait heritability estimates across populations for a more general genome-wide scan. As an exploratory analysis, and because we began with a limited number of cohorts for meta-analysis, we jointly analyzed the two separate cohorts in a mega-analysis of heritability. For a trait to be found to be heritable in the mega-analysis, the reliability of the trait within and across cohorts must be high. We can use this approach to map, on a voxelwise level, an estimate of heritability that may be unreliable in single site analyses while taking into account reliability across cohorts and, hence, image acquisition parameters. Mega-analysis may Mega Analysis (h 2 ) Fig. 6 . We can visually compare voxelwise heritability values of the two types of combined analysis, meta and mega. Meta-analysis is performed by sample size weighting, and as would be expected, the meta analysis heritability is quite similar to that of the GOBS cohort, which had a much larger sample size. The mega analysis shows greater heritability estimates overall. Warmer colors indicate that a higher portion of the overall variance is due to heritability. For improved visualization the skeleton was dilated with 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 maximum kernel.\nbe more powerful than meta-analysis in this case, although larger studies of voxelwise white matter heritability and genetic associations are needed to confirm the findings. For a more regional analysis, we also examined the heritability of mean FA along parcellated white matter labels representing specific tracts. Almost all regions, except the corticospinal tract, exhibited high heritability across and within the cohorts. This suggests that if not specifically imaged for a study, the CST may not serve as a reliable endophenotype, particularly when combining multi-site data with different acquisitions. Genetic studies involving whole-brain analyses with results concentrated in the CST should be approached cautiously. Certain regions were shown to be more heritable than the overall mean FA across the skeleton and a general factor derived from all ROIs, confirming that the genetic influence over brain structure is not uniform; hence, a prioritization of regions with highest heritability may help accelerate the search for specific genetic influences on brain structure. Regions (averaged bilaterally) that showed the greatest heritability overall are the superior longitudinal fasciculus, the sagittal stratum, the external capsule, the corona radiata, and the body of the corpus callosum. These were consistently found to be highly heritable despite differences in image acquisition between the two groups and the different ethnic backgrounds of the two cohorts.\nA mean measure from these specific regions or tracts may serve as a good endophenotype, by independently showing high heritability for at least one of the measures (Brouwer et al., 2010; Gatt et al., 2012) (although these studies also found high heritability elsewhere as well), by showing genetic associations with white matter alterations in one or more of these regions (Barnes et al., 2012; Sprooten et al., 2011b) or by associating the mean measure to a geneticallymediated disease such as Rett Syndrome (Mahmood et al., 2010) , psychosis (Karlsgodt et al., 2009) or schizophrenia (Clark et al., 2011) . If brain measures are more strongly affected by risk-associated genetic variation than clinical or behavioral measures, more efficient association studies could be designed using imaging measures as quantitative traits, However, at this point, it is not clear if imaging genetics studies require smaller samples compared to those in casecontrol designs. We previously aggregated evidence from over 20,000 MRI scans to discover genome-wide significant variants that consistently affect the brain , providing further evidence in support of imaging genetics.\nThis study, from the ENIGMA-DTI working group, was conducted to identify reliably measured endophenotypes from FA maps that are computable, in principle, from dozens of DTI studies worldwide. Consortium efforts are indeed needed to help discover the genes that affect the living human brain. Mapping out the statistical effects of these genes in a common space will help us understand the mechanistic properties of genes that influence behavior, cognition, and neurological diseases."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Our template, and its skeletonized FA map are readily available (http://enigma.loni.ucla.edu/ongoing/dti-working-group/). We provide protocols for interested parties to have their images skeletonized and transformed into the same space as our template using FSL's TBSS pipeline, and to extract lateral and bilateral mean FA values from the skeletonized regions of interest from the JHU parcellated white matter atlas already popular in many clinical DTI studies. Results will be made public and downloadable on voxel-wise and region of interest levels for future, larger meta-analytical approaches of variance components based heritability estimates of white matter integrity.
