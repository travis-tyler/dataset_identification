The TIMSS assessments are closely linked to the curricula of the participating countries, providing an indication of the degree to which students have learned concepts in mathematics and science they are likely to encounter in school. This report is concerned with the extent of potential bias introduced into the U.S. study through nonresponse on the part of schools. Data from the third cycle of TIMSS, conducted in April-June, 2003, are the basis for the current analyses. Specifically, the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), which funded the U.S. study, requires that a nonresponse bias analysis be completed for any stage of data collection which has a unit response rate less than 85 percent. In the 2003 U.S. TIMSS, the weighted response rates (prior to the use of replacement schools) for grade 4 and grade 8 schools were 70 and 71 percent, respectively, substantially below the NCES established standard."}, {"section_title": "Effects of School Nonresponse", "text": "The analysis compares selected characteristics likely to reflect bias in participation from participating and non-participating schools. Frame characteristics for public schools come from the 2000-01 Common Core of Data (CCD); for private schools, the characteristics were obtained from the 2000-01 Private School Survey (PSS). The selected variables include school control, community type; geographic region; poverty level; number of grade-eligible students enrolled; total number of students; and percentage of students by race/ethnicity categories. 1 The percentage of students eligible for the free or reduced-price lunch under the National School Lunch Program, available only for public schools, also was included. Two forms of analysis were undertaken: a test of the independence of each school characteristic and participation status, and logistic regression in which the conditional independence of these school characteristics as predictors of participation was examined. Significance tests used with analyses in the first of these categories were based on a Rao-Scott modified Chi-square statistic in the case of categorical variables and a t test on the differences between means for continuous variables. The 95 percent confidence level was used for all tests of significance. All analyses were performed using WesVar (Westat 2002) with replicate weights to properly account for the complex sample design. Two sets of school weights were used: the school base weights that did not include a nonresponse adjustment factor, and nonresponse adjusted school weights. The statistical analyses used two types of samples: the original and the final sample. The original sample treats all the schools that were replaced as non-participants; thus replacement schools are not included in this analysis. The final sample analysis includes the replacement schools in the participating schools group, and treats the nonresponding schools that were not replaced as non-participants. The final sample analysis was repeated using the nonresponse adjusted school weights. For the original sample of schools in grade 4 TIMSS (TIMSS-4), there was no statistically significant relationship detected between participation and any school characteristic in either the bivariate or logistic regression analyses. The bivariate results for the final sample of schools in TIMSS-4 indicate that participating schools had statistically significantly higher percentages of Black, non-Hispanic students than the eligible sample of schools (table 3-8). The bivariate analysis using the National School Lunch Program status also reveals that participating schools had a statistically significantly lower proportion of students eligible for this program than the eligible sample of schools (table 3-9). However, the regression analysis results do not detect any variables as significant predictors of participation in TIMSS-4 (table 3-10). For the final sample of schools in TIMSS-4 with school nonresponse adjustments applied to the weights, there was no statistically significant relationship detected between participation and any available school characteristic in both the bivariate and regression analysis. For the original sample of schools in grade 8 TIMSS (TIMSS-8), the bivariate analysis indicates statistically significant differences in three variables related to participation in: community type (table 4-1); the total number of students enrolled in participating schools was lower than in all schools (table 4-2); and the percentage of Hispanic students in participating schools was lower than the eligible sample (table 4-3). The regression analysis shows only that the total number of students enrolled in participating schools to be statistically significantly lower than in all schools in . For the final sample, the bivariate analysis shows two of the three variables remained statistically significant: community type (table 4-6) and the total number of students enrolled was statistically significantly lower in participating schools than in the eligible sample (table 4-7). The regression analysis indicated that rural/small town schools were more likely than urban fringe/large town schools to participate (4-10). For the final sample of schools in TIMSS-8 with school nonresponse adjustments applied to the weights, the results are identical to the previous analysis. xi "}, {"section_title": "List of Tables", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "4-7", "text": "Mean enrollment of eligible and participating schools in the U.S. TIMSS eighth-grade final sample: "}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) is a large international comparative study of the knowledge, skills, and competencies of fourth-and eighth-grade students in the domains of mathematics and science. The study was carried out in some 45 countries, including the United States. The student population sampled in TIMSS is defined as all students in each country who were enrolled in the upper of the two adjacent grades that contained the greatest proportions of 9-and 13-year-olds respectively at the time of testing. In most participating nations, including the United States, this corresponds to all fourth-graders and eighth-graders. The U.S. TIMSS study, supported by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) and the National Science Foundation, utilized a two-stage stratified cluster sampling design. The first stage made use of a systematic probability-proportionate-to-size technique to select schools. Though efforts were made to secure the participation of all schools selected in the first stage, it was anticipated that not all schools would choose to participate. Therefore, as each school was selected in the sample, the two neighboring schools in the sampling frame (immediately preceding and following it) were designated as replacement schools. If an original school refused to participate, the first replacement was then contacted. If that school also refused to participate, the second school was then contacted. The second stage of sampling consisted of selecting classrooms within sampled schools. At the classroom level, TIMSS sampled intact mathematics classes that were available to students in the target grades. The U.S. fourth-grade sample consisted of 300 eligible schools 2 containing at least one fourth-grade class. Low-income schools-defined as those in which at least 50 percent of students were eligible for participation in the federal National School Lunch Program (NSLP)-were oversampled. The U.S. eighth-grade sample consisted of 296 eligible 3 schools containing at least one eighth-grade class. There was no oversampling of any type of schools at grade eight. Where feasible, two classrooms were selected per school in the United States. In schools containing only one class, this class was selected. Data were collected in April, May, and June 2003. Detailed information on technical aspects of the study is included in appendix A. The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) standards for assessment surveys stipulate that a nonresponse bias analysis is required at any stage of data collection with a weighted unit response rate less than 85 percent. For grade 4 (hereafter referred to as TIMSS-4), the weighted response rate for eligible schools was 70 percent, with 212 out of 300 schools participating. For grade 8 (hereafter referred to as TIMSS-8), the unweighted response rate for eligible schools was 71 percent, with 211 out of schools participating. See table A-1 for details on the U.S. TIMSS school participation rates. Since the U.S. TIMSS weighted school response rates are below 85 percent, NCES requires an investigation into the potential magnitude of nonresponse bias at the school level in the U.S. sample, which is the focus of this report. The methodology used to investigate nonresponse bias analysis in the TIMSS-4 and TIMSS-8 U.S. samples is provided in chapter 2, and the results are provided in chapters 3 and 4. Conclusions follow in chapter 5."}, {"section_title": "Methodology", "text": "To measure the potential nonresponse bias at the school level, the characteristics of participating schools were compared to those of the total eligible sample of schools. The alternative of comparing participants to non-participants, while resulting in the same tests of significance, makes it more difficult to judge the potential for bias. This analysis is similar to other NCES nonresponse bias studies on the 2005 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) (Kali and Rust 2005) "}, {"section_title": "and the 2001 Program for", "text": "International Reading Literacy Study (Piesse and Rust 2003). The analysis for each grade was conducted in three parts: \u2022 First, the distribution of the responding original school sample was compared with that of the total eligible original school sample. The original sample is the sample before substitution. In each sample, schools were weighted by their school base weights that did not include a nonresponse adjustment factor. The base weight for each original school was the reciprocal of its selection probability. \u2022 Second, the distribution of the responding sample, which includes the participating replacements that were used as substitutes for schools from the original sample that did not participate, was compared to the total eligible final sample. The final sample is the sample after substitution. Again, school base weights were used for both the eligible sample and the participating schools. The base weight for each replacement school was equal to the base weight of the original school that it replaced. \u2022 Third, the same sets of schools were compared as in the second analysis but, this time, when analyzing the responding schools alone, school nonresponse adjustments were applied to the weights. The international weighting procedures created a nonresponse adjustment class for each explicit stratum. For TIMSS-4, the explicit strata were defined simply by school control. For TIMSS-8, there was no explicit stratification and thus a single adjustment class. The first analysis indicates the potential for nonresponse bias that was introduced through school nonresponse. The second analysis suggests the remaining potential for nonresponse bias after the mitigating effects of substitution have been accounted for. The third analysis indicates the potential for bias after accounting for the mitigating effects of both substitution and nonresponse weight adjustments. Both the second and third analyses, however, may provide an overly optimistic scenario, since even though substitution and nonresponse adjustments may correct somewhat for deficiencies in the few characteristics examined here, there is no guarantee that they are equally as effective for other characteristics, and in particular for student achievement. To compare TIMSS participants and the total eligible sample, the sample of schools was matched to the sample frame to compare as many characteristics as possible that might provide information about the presence of nonresponse bias. Comparing frame characteristics for participants and the total eligible sample is not an ideal measure of nonresponse bias if the characteristics are unrelated or weakly related to more substantive items in the survey; however, this is often the only approach available. Frame characteristics for public schools were taken from the 2000-01 Common Core of Data (CCD) and, for private schools, from the 2000-01 Private School Survey (PSS). The following categorical variables were available for all schools: \u2022 school control-indicates whether the school is under public control (operated by publicly elected or appointed officials) or private control (operated by privately elected or appointed officials and derives its major source of funds from private sources); \u2022 community type-the location of a school relative to populous areas, i.e., central city, urban fringe/large town, rural/small town; \u2022 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) region (see appendix for state listing); and \u2022 poverty level 4 -for public schools, a high poverty school is defined as one in which 50 percent or more of the students are eligible for participation in the NSLP; all private schools are treated as low poverty schools. The following continuous variables were available for all schools: \u2022 number of grade eligible (4 or 8) students enrolled; \u2022 total number of students; and \u2022 percentage of students in five race/ethnicity categories (White, non-Hispanic; Black, non-Hispanic; Hispanic; Asian or Pacific Islander; and American Indian or Alaska Native). An additional continuous variable, the percentage of students eligible to participate in the NSLP, was available only for public schools. For categorical variables, the distribution of frame characteristics for participants was compared with the distribution for all schools. The hypothesis of independence between the characteristic and participation status was tested using a Rao-Scott modified Chi-square statistic at the 5 percent level (Rao and Thomas 2003). For continuous variables, summary means were calculated and the difference between means was tested using a t test. The statistical significance of differences between participants and the total eligible sample is identical to that which would result from comparing participants and non-participants, since all significance tests account for the fact that the participants are a subset of the full sample. The bias and relative bias are also given in each table. The bias is the difference between the respective estimates for the participants and the eligible sample. The relative bias is calculated as the bias divided by the estimate from the eligible sample. The relative bias is a measure of the size of the bias compared to the eligible sample estimate. In addition to these tests, logistic regression models were used to provide a multivariate analysis in which the conditional independence of these school characteristics as predictors of participation was examined. It may be that only one or two variables are actually related to participation status. However, if these variables are also related to the other variables examined in the analyses, then other variables, which are not related to participation status, will appear as significant in simple bivariate tables. The logistic regression was performed using WesVar (Westat 2002) and replicate weights to properly account for the complex sample design. The paired jackknife replication method was used to create the replicate weights (Brick, Morganstein, and Valliant 2000)."}, {"section_title": "Results-TIMSS Grade 4 Original Respondent Sample", "text": "This section presents the results of the nonresponse bias analysis, based exclusively on the original sample of 300 eligible U.S. schools for TIMSS-4.

For the original sample of schools in TIMSS-4, there was no statistically significant relationship detected between participation and any school characteristic in either the bivariate or logistic regression analyses. The bivariate results for the final sample of schools in TIMSS-4 indicated that participating schools had statistically significantly higher percentages of Black, non-Hispanic students than the eligible sample of schools (table 3-8). The bivariate analysis using the free or reduced-price lunch program also revealed that participating schools had a statistically significantly lower proportion of students eligible for this program than the eligible sample of schools (table 3-9).

It also suggests that while there is certainly no evidence that the use of replacement schools reduced the potential for bias it has also not substantially added to it.

These results suggest that there is some potential for nonresponse bias in the TIMSS-8 original sample based on the characteristics studied. Thus while there is certainly no evidence that the use of replacement schools reduced the potential for bias, it has also not substantially added to it. The school nonresponse adjustment had no effect on the characteristics of the weighted responding sample of schools."}, {"section_title": "Sampling, Data Collection, and Response Rates in the United States", "text": "The TIMSS 2003 school sample was drawn for the United States in November 2002. The sample design for this school sample was developed to follow international requirements as given in the TIMSS sampling manual. The U.S. sample for 2003 was a two-stage sampling process with the first stage a sample of schools, and the second stage a sample of students' classrooms from the target grade in sampled schools. Unlike TIMSS 1995 and 1999, the sample was not clustered at the geographic level for TIMSS 2003. This change was made in an effort to reduce the design effects and to spread the respondent burden across school districts as much as possible. The sample design for TIMSS was a stratified systematic sample, with sampling probabilities proportional to measures of size. The U.S. TIMSS fourth grade sample had two explicit strata based on poverty. A high poverty school was defined as one in which 50 percent or more of the students were eligible for participation in the federal National School Lunch Program (NSLP); high poverty schools were oversampled (Ferraro and Rust 2003) This variable was not available for private schools, so they were all treated as low poverty schools. The target sample sizes were 120 high-poverty and 190 lowpoverty schools. Within the poverty strata, there are four categorical implicit stratification variables: type of school (public or private), region of the country 5 (Northeast, Southeast, Central, West), type of location relative to populous areas (eight levels), and minority status (above or below 15 percent). The last sort key within the implicit stratification was by grade enrollment in descending order. The TIMSS eighth-grade sample had no explicit stratification. The frame was implicitly stratified (i.e., sorted for sampling) by four categorical stratification variables: type of school (public or private), region of the country, type of location relative to populous areas (eight levels), and minority status (above or below 15 percent). The last sort key within the implicit stratification was by grade enrollment in descending order. Though efforts were made to secure the participation of all schools selected, it was anticipated that not all schools would choose to participate. Therefore, as each school was selected in the sample, the two neighboring schools in the sampling frame (immediately preceding and following it) were designated as replacement schools. If an original school refused to participate, the first replacement was then contacted. If that school also refused to participate, the second school was then contacted. There were several constraints on the assignment of substitutes. One sampled school was not allowed to substitute for another, and a given school could not be assigned to substitute for more than one sampled school. Furthermore, substitutes were required to be in the same implicit stratum as the sampled school. If the sampled school was the first or last school in the stratum, then the second school following or preceding the sampled school was identified as the substitute. One was designated a first replacement and the other a second replacement. If an original school refused to participate, the first replacement was then contacted. If that school also refused to participate, the second school was then contacted. The schools were selected with probability proportionate to the school's estimated enrollment of fourthand eighth-grade students from the 2003 NAEP school frame with 2000-01 school data. The data for public schools were from the Common Core of Data (CCD), and the data for private schools were from the Private School Survey (PSS). Any school containing a fourth or an eighth grade as of the school year 2000-01 was included on the school sampling frame. Participating schools provided lists of fourth-or eighth-grade classrooms, and one or two intact mathematics classrooms were selected within each school in an equal probability sample. The overall sample design for the United States was intended to approximate a self-weighting sample of students as much as possible, with each fourth-or eighth-grade student having an equal probability of being selected. The U.S. TIMSS fourth-grade school sample consisted of 310 schools, of which 300 were eligible schools and 212 agreed to participate. The school response rate before replacement was 70 percent (weighted; 71 percent unweighted). The weighted school response rate before replacement is given by the formula: weighted school response , rate before replacement where Y denotes the set of participating original sample schools with age-eligible students, N denotes the set of eligible non-participating original sample schools, W i denotes the base weight for school i, W i = 1/P i , where P i denotes the school selection probability for school i, and E i denotes the enrollment size of grade-eligible students, as indicated on the sampling frame. In addition to the 212 participating schools, 36 replacement schools also participated for a total of 248 participating schools at the fourth grade in the United States. A total of 10,795 students were sampled for the fourth-grade assessment. Of these students, 49 were withdrawn from the school before the assessment was administrated. Of the eligible 10,746 sampled students, an additional 429 students were excluded using the criteria described above, for a weighted exclusion rate of 5 percent. Of the 10,317 remaining sample students, a total of 9,829 students participated in the assessment in the United States, since 488 students were absent. The student participation rate was 95 percent. The U.S. TIMSS eighth-grade school sample consisted of 301 schools, of which 296 were eligible schools and 211 agreed to participate. The school response rate before replacement was 71 percent (weighted and unweighted). In addition to the 211 participating schools, 21 replacement schools also participated for a total of 232 participating schools at the eighth grade in the United States. A total of 9,891 students were sampled for the assessment. Of these students, 90 were withdrawn from the school before the assessment was administrated. Of the eligible 9,801 sampled students, an additional 279 students were excluded using the criteria described above, for a weighted exclusion rate of 5 percent. Of the 9,522 remaining sample students, a total of 8,912 students participated in the assessment in the United States, since 610 students were absent. The student participation rate was 94 percent (weighted and unweighted)."}, {"section_title": "Weighting", "text": "Before the data are analyzed, responses from the groups of students assessed are assigned sampling weights to ensure that their representation in TIMSS 2003 results matches their actual percentage of the school population in the grade assessed. Sampling weights are used to adjust for over-representation or under-representation from particular student groups or types of schools. The use of sampling weights is necessary for the computation of statistically sound, nationally representative estimators. The base weight assigned to a school or student is the inverse of the probability that the school or student would be selected for the sample. When responses are weighted, none are discarded, and each contributes to the results for the total number of schools and students that participated. Weighting also adjusts for various situations such as school and student nonresponse because data cannot be assumed to be randomly missing.

Students were asked first whether they were Hispanic or Latino, and then asked whether they were members of the following racial groups: American Indian/Alaska Native; Asian; Black or African American; Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander; or White. Multiple responses to the race classification question were allowed."}, {"section_title": "Sampling Errors", "text": "Sampling errors occur when the discrepancy between a population characteristic and the sample estimate arises because not all members of the reference population are sampled for the survey. The size of the sample relative to the population and the variability of the population characteristics both influence the magnitude of sampling error. The particular sample of students in fourth and eighth grade from the 2002-03 school year was just one of many possible samples that could have been selected. Therefore, estimates produced from the TIMSS sample may differ from estimates that would have been produced had another student sample been drawn. This type of variability is called sampling error because it arises from using a sample of students in fourth or eighth grade, rather than all students in the grade in that year. The standard error is a measure of the variability due to sampling when estimating a statistic, and is often included in reports containing estimates from survey data. The approach used for calculating sampling variances in TIMSS was the Jackknife Repeated Replication (JRR). In this report we do not show estimates of standard errors for each estimate. Rather the effects of sampling error are reflected in the test statistics (for t tests and chi-square tests, and t test used in logistic regression analyses) that are presented for each analysis. These are described below. The first step to compute the variance with replication is to calculate the estimate of interest from the full sample as well as each subsample or replicate. The variation between the replicate estimates and the fullsample estimate is then used to estimate the variance for the full sample. Suppose that \u03b8 is the fullsample estimate of some population parameter \u03b8 . The variance estimator, ( ) v \u03b8 , takes the form This statistic is then compared to the critical values of the appropriate Student t-distribution, to determine whether the difference is statistically significant. The appropriate number of degrees of freedom for the distribution is given by the number of primary sampling units in the design (in this case the number of schools), minus the number of sampling strata. Note that this procedure took account of the fact that the two samples in question were not independent samples, but in fact the responding sample was a subsample of the full sample. This effect was accounted for in calculating the standard error of the difference. Note also that, in those cases where both samples were weighted just using base weights the test is exactly equivalent to testing that the mean of the respondents was equal to the mean of the nonrespondents. Consider for example the data in Table 3-2. The first row shows that the weighted mean total school enrollment for the full eligible sample of grade 4 schools is 583.9. For the subsample of schools that participated the corresponding mean is 576.4, and difference of 7.5. The standard error of this estimated difference, calculated so as to reflect the dependency between these two samples, and the complex sample design, is 10.6. This gives rise to a t-statistic of -0.70, and using 75 degrees of freedom (the appropriate figure for the TIMSS design), the resulting significance (or p-value) is 0.483. This last figure appears in the table. t tests were also used in the logistic regression for testing for the hypothesis for whether each estimated parameter estimate is significantly different from 0. Then the t test is defined as ( ) is the replication variance estimate for that parameter. This statistic is then compared to the critical values of the appropriate Student t-distribution, as described above, to determine whether the difference is statistically significant. The appropriate number of degrees of freedom for the distribution is again given by the number of primary sampling units in the design (in this case the number of schools), minus the number of sampling strata."}, {"section_title": "Chi-Square Tests", "text": "Chi-square tests are used for testing whether two distributions of a given categorical variable are different, conducted in a way that reflects the impact of the complex sample design on sampling variance. In this instance one distribution is for the full sample, and one for the responding sample. Suppose that the categorical variable in question has c levels, cross-tabulated producing weighted proportions p. where j denotes the categories of the categorical variable, and i indexes the samples (full sample and respondents), and n indicates the overall sample size. This statistic is not suitable for use directly in a statistical test with these data, for two reasons. First, the fact that the respondents are a subset of the full sample violates the standard assumptions for a chi-square test of this kind. Second, this statistic does not account for the complex sample design used to collect the data. Thus the Pearson Chi-square statistic is modified appropriately to account for the impact of these two features. The resulting test statistic is referred to as the Rao-Scott Adjusted chi-square statistic. It is sometimes also referred to as the Satterthwaite-adjusted chi-square statistic. The number of degrees of freedom for the chi-square test, normally given as (c -1), where c is the number of categories of the categorical variable for each distribution, is also modified on account of the complex design. The modified test statistic is then compared to the chi-square distribution with the appropriate number of degrees of freedom, to determine whether the difference in the two distributions is statistically significant. For a detailed description of the technique, see Rao and Scott (1984) or Rao and Thomas (2003). The first step in the calculation of the Satterthwaite-adjusted chi-square statistic is to form the following Since \u03bd \uf020 will generally not be an integer, interpolation in standard chi-square tables is required. "}, {"section_title": "Logistic Regression Models", "text": "A linear model for investigating the relationship between binary (dichotomous) outcomes and a set of explanatory variables is referred to as a logistic regression model. The data are assumed to follow a binomial distribution, with probabilities that depend on the independent variables. In this instance the binary outcome of interest is whether or not the sampled unit participated in TIMSS. Let p i denote the probability that the ith sampled school will participate. Under the logistic regression model, the log odds of response propensity (expressed in terms of the logarithm of p i /(1-p i )), is assumed to have the following linear form: where X 1i , X 2i ..., X pi are p auxiliary variables associated with the ith sampled school, and 0 , \u03b2 1 , ..., p \u03b2 \u03b2 are coefficients to be estimated. Asymptotic assumptions are used to develop statistical tests to determine which, if any, of the coefficients are significantly different from zero. In the analyses in this report the standard procedures for carrying out logistic regression analyses have been modified both to incorporate the sampling weights in the estimation of the coefficients, and to reflect the effect of the complex sample design on the variance-covariance matrix of the coefficients.
