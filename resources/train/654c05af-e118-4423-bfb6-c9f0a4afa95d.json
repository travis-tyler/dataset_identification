The specter of a \"resource curse\" shrouds the promise (Sachs and Warner 1999, 2001) . But the success of several countries-Chile, Malaysia, and Norway, for example-in transforming natural resources into long-term development suggests that such a curse is not inevitable (Lederman and Maloney 2007) . Harnessing the returns from natural resource wealth can contribute substantially to eradicating extreme poverty and enhancing shared prosperity.\nSuccess requires a series of good decisions and sound implementation. Recent declines in oil prices highlight just one of the risks associated with growth driven by natural resource wealth. Revenues from natural resources are volatile, and government strategies for managing these resources need to take into account the possibility of busts as well as booms and to address the challenge of transforming finite, volatile resources into sources of growth (figure 1.1).\nGovernments and other stakeholders must grapple with (at least) four central questions when they seek to transform a finite amount of natural resources into lasting development (Barma and others 2012; van der Ploeg and Venables 2011; Venables 2016 ):\n1. What is the optimal contract between government and entities that extract natural resources to balance public benefits with incentives to the private sector? 2. What is the optimal timing of extraction to ensure the maximum stream of benefits from reserves? 3. What is the optimal portfolio allocation of mineral revenues between consumption, savings, and investments? And what should be the profile of investments with regard to financial assets, physical capital (for example, infrastructure), and human capital? 4. How can resource revenue be spent most effectively and efficiently, and what complementary activities or reforms are required to ensure effectiveness and efficiency?\nAnswers to these questions determine whether the benefits of natural resource extraction will last through the long term. This book focuses on questions 3 and 4, exploring, in particular, how long-term benefits can be achieved by investing in human capital-in part because this issue is too often overlooked.\nAs the book makes clear, investing in human capital-understood broadly to include education, capabilities, and health-should be a central part of the strategy for converting natural resources into long-term development. It extends the time horizon of the natural resource windfall by converting a finite resource into a form of capital that can be preserved through generations, it helps to promote growth by distributing wealth broadly, and it helps to lay the foundation for broad-based economic development as natural resource revenues decline.\nHowever, investing well in human capital is hard; the track record of using natural resource wealth to lessen poverty and promote better education and health outcomes is not good. Moreover, because resource-rich countries tend not to spend much on human capital, and, because the challenges in delivering services are exacerbated in these countries, the outcomes are not impressive. Spending wisely and directly confronting challenges that are unique to natural-resource-rich countries are both essential for success."}, {"section_title": "Natural Resource Wealth, National Income, Poverty, and Inequality", "text": "Natural resource wealth-and oil wealth in particular-has been supporting dramatic growth in national incomes in SSA countries. Between 1995 and 2013, gross national income (GNI) per capita in the region as a whole rose 50 percent. The gain was 80 percent in oil-rich countries, but substantially lower, at 40 percent, in non-resource-rich countries (figure 1.2). Countries identified as \"potentially\" resource-rich (with reserves identified but not yet extracted) also grew quickly (70 percent over the period), although this was from a much lower base and annual increases in income were smaller.\n1 Box 1.1 presents the country classifications.\nThis chapter assesses the extent to which the higher national income resulting from this growth is associated with higher human capital outcomes and less inequality in those outcomes. It then assesses patterns of investment in human capital by different types of countries. The chapter uses new databases built from individual and household-level surveys to contrast levels and inequalities in outcomes between resource-rich and non-resource-rich countries, both within and beyond Sub-Saharan Africa.

The classification is based on the analysis described in IMF (2012), which defines countries as resource-rich if they had either natural resource revenue of at least 20 percent of total revenue or natural resource exports of at least 20 percent of total exports for 2006-10. The classification includes some countries for which data are lacking (C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Liberia, Niger, and Uzbekistan) and is augmented by Namibia and South Africa based on later analyses of World Development Indicators data (Filmer and Denisova 2015) . Countries identified as potentially resource-rich are those with identified reserves where production has not begun or reached significant levels."}, {"section_title": "box continues next page", "text": "Natural resource wealth is closely associated with higher national income in Sub-Saharan Africa (figure 1.3). Average GNI per capita in 2013 was US$4,528 in oil-rich countries and US$2,607 in nonoil resource-rich countries, compared with US$1,683 in non-resource-rich countries. In the last group, it is noteworthy that countries identified as potentially resource-rich tend to have substantially T o m \u00e9 a n d P r \u00ed n c i p e T a n z a n i a U g a n d a G h a n a B u r u n d i M a l a w i R w a n d a L e s o t h o B e n i n lower national income (US$776) than countries identified as not having potential resources (US$2,113). The countries that have the potential for large windfalls from natural resource extraction are starting from a substantially lower base. Poverty rates, in contrast to national income, are only slightly lower in countries rich in natural resources (Christiaensen and Devarajan 2013) . While extreme poverty in SSA, measured as the share of the population living on less than US$1.25 a day, tends to be lower in resource-rich than in non-resource-rich countries, the contrast is much smaller when the poverty threshold is set at US$2.50 a day (figure 1.4). At this threshold, average poverty is 33 percent in oil-rich SSA countries, compared with 45 percent in nonoil resource-rich countries and 46 percent in non-resource-rich countries in the region. 2 The modest improvement in poverty is reversed after national income is taken into account; poverty reduction is worse in resource-rich countries than in other countries at the same income level. Figure 1 .5 shows the differences by country classification after adjusting for GNI per capita. Poverty rates are higher in the resource-rich countries and significantly higher in oil-rich countries at the US$5-a-day poverty threshold. This is consistent with patterns of structural transformation in the region. Growth has been less poverty-reducing in SSA than in other parts of the world, and growth in resource-rich countries has reduced poverty less than growth in other countries (Chuhan-Pole 2013). Moreover, in SSA growth in agriculture and services-where the majority of poor people work-tends to result in larger reductions in poverty than growth in industry, which includes mining (figure 1.6; also see Chuhan-Pole 2014; Filmer and Fox 2014) .\nWhether or not a country is rich in natural resources is not systematically associated with broad measures of inequality, such as the share of income controlled by the top decile or quintile or the Gini index, which measures inequality across the entire income distribution. Inequality tends to be slightly lower in oil-rich countries and slightly higher in nonoil resource-rich countries compared with other countries in the region, but this surprising finding may have more to do with how inequality is measured than with actual inequality. Surveys used to measure household consumption often (a) fail to capture the high levels of consumption among the wealthiest and (b) exclude the wealthiest from the sample completely. Both effects would tend to underestimate inequality, especially in countries where a very few individuals control most of the wealth. This appears indeed to be the case in SSA, especially in resource-rich countries (Beegle and others 2016) . "}, {"section_title": "Natural Resource Wealth and Human Development", "text": "This book is concerned mainly with the link between natural resource wealth and the accumulation of human capital. The rest of this chapter first reviews evidence on levels and inequalities in human capital outcomes in SSA and then turns to indicators of government investment-and its effectiveness-in education and health. Despite exceptions like Chile, Malaysia, and Norway, natural-resource-rich countries have often been charged with not investing enough in education and health to build a solid foundation of human capital (Birdsall, Pinckney, and Sabot 2001; Bravo-Ortega and de Gregorio 2007; Gylfason 2001; Philippot 2010) . 3 This observation is consistent with the cross-country data; SSA countries that are oil-rich fare poorly on the United Nation's human development index (HDI), which integrates national income, life expectancy, educational attainment, and school participation. For each level of GNI per capita, oil-rich countries in SSA have consistently lower HDIs than other countries both inside and outside the region (figure 1.7).

First, they only contain country aggregates, which precludes analysis of within-country inequalities in outcomes. Second, the data are often \"smoothed\" and interpolated in ways that may induce regularities that are functions of the modeling used for smoothing and interpolating rather than actual patterns (for example, if national income is used to predict a variable, subsequent associations between that variable and national income will be spurious). Both problems are overcome here by using new compilations of data based directly on household surveys. For education outcomes, the book uses data from the Educational Attainment and Enrollment around the World database, which contains indicators from 504 surveys from 109 countries that are derived from analyses of data from the DHS, MICS, the i2d2 database, and other national household surveys. a This database covers 41 SSA countries (208 surveys) and 68 non-SSA countries (296 surveys). Of the 41 SSA countries, 7 are oil-rich, 10 are nonoil resource-rich, 9 are non-resource-rich with potential, and 15 are non-resource-rich.

It combines data from the DHS and MICS and was augmented with data from the MICS interactive website. b This database covers 44 SSA countries (161 surveys) and 57 non-SSA countries (175 surveys). Of the 44 SSA countries, 8 are oil-rich, 10 are nonoil resource-rich, 9 are non-resource-rich with potential, and 17 are non-resource-rich.

School participation: the probability that a child age 6-14 is reported as currently attending school. The measure combines both household factors that affect enrollment rates (for example, financial constraints or low demand for poor-quality schooling) as well as supply-side factors (for example, availability of schools). 2. School attainment: the probability that a young person age 15-19 years has completed grade 6. Among determinants of this completion rate are not only the demand and supply factors that affect enrollment but also the factors that affect school retention. Indeed, in many countries initial enrollment in school is high, but, as a result of dropouts and repetition, completion of grade 6 is much lower, especially for the poor (figure 1.8).\nTo assess how outcomes differ by country classification, subgroup outcomes are compared, with non-resource-rich SSA countries as the reference group and controlling for national income. 5 The analysis is carried out for each indicator first for the entire population and then by quintile.\nControlling for national income, education outcomes are systematically worse in oil-rich SSA countries than in non-resource-rich SSA countries. The percentage of children ages 6-15 years who are currently attending school and the percentage of young persons age 15-19 years who have completed grade 6 are 7-8 percentage points lower in oil-rich than in non-resource-rich countries compared with what would be expected for their level of income ( figure 1.9 ). This pattern is more pronounced among the poor-for children and youth in the poorest quintile, the shortfall is 15-20 percentage points-although the association cuts across all household welfare levels. The pattern of results is similar, although more muted, in nonoil resource-rich countries. There, school completion is similar\nThe household survey-derived indicators of health are as follows:\n\u2022 Infant mortality rate (number of deaths of children younger than age 12 months per 1,000 live births) \u2022 Proportion of children with a full course of vaccinations (proportion ages 12-23 months who received Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCD), measles, and three doses of polio and diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus (DPT), vaccines) \u2022 Proportion of children who are stunted (children younger than 5 years old with a height-forage z-score less than 2 standard deviations from the reference median). (continued) to that of non-resource-rich countries, but school participation is systematically worse, although statistically not significantly so. The education shortfall in Africa's resource-rich countries is all the more striking because there is no shortfall in resource-rich countries in other parts of the world. In countries outside SSA, grade 6 completion is systematically higher in resource-rich than in non-resource-rich countries (again, after accounting for GNI per capita).

Vaccination rates are also substantially lower: the number of children ages 12-13 months who have had their full course of vaccinations is more than 30 percentage points lower in oil-rich SSA countries than in non-resource-rich countries after controlling for national income; for nonoil resource-rich countries, coverage is about 15 percentage points lower.

The deficit among the poor is systematically larger in oil-rich than in nonoil resource-rich countries (table 1.1). For example, the gap in grade 6 completion is 33 percentage points in non-resource-rich SSA countries, compared with 48 percentage points in oil-rich countries and 39 percentage points in nonoil resource-rich countries.\nThe gap in receiving a full course of vaccinations is 17 percentage points in nonresource-rich SSA countries, compared with 36 percentage points in oil-rich countries. This stark pattern of larger inequalities in SSA is not found in the non-SSA sample of countries. Rich-poor gaps are remarkably large in oil-rich SSA countries for most indicator averages. Figure 1 .12 plots the difference between the richest and poorest quintiles for two key indicators-grade 6 completion and full vaccination coverage-against the average value of the indicators in these countries. If at any given average inequalities are high, this will appear as a point toward the top of each chart. Clearly, oil-rich countries stand out as having particularly high inequalities. While inequalities by household welfare are large, other dimensions of inequality-such as those by gender-also tend to be larger in resource-rich countries (box 1.3)."}, {"section_title": "Data Gaps and Quality of Outcomes", "text": "While the data described so far represent substantial progress in terms of ability to document patterns across countries, further analysis faces severe data limitations. Perhaps most important is the fact that crucial dimensions of human capital accumulation are not measured. In particular, there is minimal information on the quality of schooling as measured by learning assessments.\nOnly three SSA countries-Botswana, Ghana, and South Africa-have participated in the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), an internationally benchmarked learning assessment; in this book, Botswana and South Africa are classified as nonoil resource-rich and Ghana is classified as non-resource-rich with potential. 6 Results from this assessment reveal substantial shortfalls in the learning outcomes that Africa's schools generate ( figure 1.13 ).

Other dimensions of inequality also appear to differ systematically between resourcerich and non-resource-rich SSA countries. Gender gaps stand out. The average difference between boys and girls in the school participation of children ages 6-14 years is 21 percentage points in non-resource-rich SSA countries, compared with 31 percentage points in oil-rich countries and 26 percentage points in nonoil resource-rich countries. The differences are starker for grade 6 completion because gender gaps tend to widen at higher levels of schooling. For example, the male-female gap is 33 percentage points in non-resource-rich SSA countries but 47 percentage points in oil-rich SSA countries.\nabout 80 percent of grade 8 students in Ghana and grade 9 students in South Africa cannot show that they have \"some knowledge of whole numbers and decimals, operations, and basic graphs.\" Very few students in these countries can \"apply basic knowledge in a variety of situations.\" These learning deficits begin early, and, as discussed in chapter 4, early deficits have long-term implications-both for later education outcomes (such as the TIMSS measure in later grades) and in other realms of life.\nWhile this chapter focuses on indicators that are measured consistently in enough countries to establish patterns for resource-rich and non-resource-rich countries, it is important to keep in mind that other, perhaps even more important, indicators cannot be integrated into the analysis. The indicators used here should be viewed as proxies for a broader concept of human capital, as they provide an incomplete picture (see Beegle and others 2016 for a fuller discussion of data needs and challenges in SSA)."}, {"section_title": "Public Spending on Education and Health in Resource-Rich Countries", "text": "Relative to other types of government engagement and action, the role of public spending in determining outcomes is controversial. On average, public spending on education or health tends to be only loosely related to outcomes (Dreher, Nunnenkamp, and Thiele 2008; Filmer and Pritchett 1999; World Bank 2003) . Some analysts have found positive associations between spending and child mortality and school enrollment, although others emphasize that factors like national income or general economic stability are also important (Baldacci and others 2008; Bokhari, Gai, and Gottret 2007) .\nThe average association may be masking factors that make spending more or less effective. For instance, the impact of spending may vary across the income distribution: there is some evidence that spending matters more to improving outcomes for the poor (Bidani and Ravallion 1997) . But a second factor is perhaps more pervasive: because spending can be done \"well\" or \"poorly,\" there is no guarantee that it will produce better outcomes. Analysts have used direct measures of governance to show its importance in making public spending more effective in both education and health (Rajkumar and Swaroop 2008) . Indirect evidence suggests that international assistance to education tends to be more effective than general public spending on education (Dreher, Nunnenkamp, and Thiele 2008) ; in part because aid is less prone to leakages and tends to be more pro-poor, it is typically dedicated to inputs other than teacher salaries, which form the bulk of public spending on education.\nThe effectiveness of government expenditures is addressed in more depth in chapter 3, which discusses the types of reforms required to make spending effective, and in chapter 4, which discusses the types of investments that have the highest payoff. The next two sections of this chapter establish patterns in spending on education and health across resource-rich and non-resource-rich countries and assess the extent to which more spending is associated with better outcomes."}, {"section_title": "Amount of Public Spending on Education and Health", "text": "Public spending on both education and health tends to be higher in resource-rich SSA countries than in other SSA countries. On average, governments in oil-rich SSA countries spend US$69 per capita on education, nonoil resource-rich countries spend US$116, non-resource-rich countries spend US$49, and countries \"with potential\" spend only US$19 (table 1. 2). 7 The pattern for per capita public health spending is similar: on a per person basis, resource-rich SSA countries spend, on average, almost twice what non-resource-rich countries do.\nThe pattern is reversed, however, when public spending is considered as a share of GDP. The percentage of GDP devoted to education and health in oil-rich SSA countries is close to half the amount spent in non-resource-rich SSA countries. This is not the pattern outside SSA, where government spending on education in nonoil resource-rich countries is lower than, and that on health is similar to, government spending in non-resource-rich countries. Figure 1 .14 shows spending per capita on each sector (averaged between 2000 and 2013) relative to nonresource-rich SSA countries, after controlling for national income. In both sectors, the oil-rich SSA countries spend about 60 percent less per capita."}, {"section_title": "Public Spending and Education and Health Outcomes", "text": "The relationship between spending and outcomes is typically tenuous. Money can be well-deployed, but that is not always the case. The data assembled so far can be used further to assess the extent to which the association between spending and outcomes is stronger or weaker for resource-rich countries and whether it differs for the poor. The approach used is to estimate the statistical (average, 2000-13) Health (average, 2000-13 relationship between public spending in each country subgroup (for example, oil-rich SSA countries) and each outcome, in a model that controls for national per capita income, and additional variables that have been shown to be associated with outcomes and whose exclusion might lead to overinterpreting the role of public spending. The variables are income inequality (as measured by the Gini index), the extent of urbanization, ethnic and linguistic fractionalization (drawn from Alesina and others 2003) , and the education of adult women in the population (drawn from Barro and Lee 2010), defined as average years of schooling of women ages 15 years and older (to guard against spurious associations, the model is estimated with and without this variable). In general, the findings are consistent with what has been documented elsewhere: there is little evidence that spending, on average, has systematic positive effects on outcomes. Public spending per capita on education is associated with more children ages 6-14 years being in school and with more young persons ages 15-19 years having completed grade 6, but typically the magnitude of these associations is not statistically significantly different from zero ( figure 1.15 ). For each percentage point increase in per capita education spending in a non-resource-rich SSA country, enrollment of children ages 6-14 years rises 1.2 percentage points, but more spending on education is not associated with more teenagers finishing grade 6. The pattern for oil-rich SSA countries suggests that spending on education is significantly associated with higher enrollment, but not with grade 6 completion-a pattern that is starker for children from the poorest quintile. This is the pattern one might expect if spending increases with the number of students who attend school. But the spending is ineffective in that students fail to reach the end of the primary cycle in a timely fashion. In other (nonoil) resourcerich SSA countries, spending on education is not statistically significantly related to either school participation or grade 6 completion.\nPublic spending on health is likewise only weakly associated with better health outcomes ( figure 1.16 ). In oil-rich SSA countries, a 1 percent increase in spending on health is not statistically significantly associated with lower infant mortality, better vaccination coverage, or less stunting-either overall or for children in the poorest quintile. In the nonoil resource-rich SSA countries, more spending appears to be associated with better vaccination coverage of "}]
