The ECLS-B selected a national sample of children, born in the year 2001, to follow from birth through first grade. The ECLS-B is part of a longitudinal studies program comprised of two cohorts-a birth cohort and a kindergarten cohort. Together, these cohorts provide the depth and breadth of data required to describe children's health, early learning, development, and education experiences.The kindergarten cohort study (ECLS-K) measures aspects of children's development and their environments (home and school) as they enter school for the first time and examines how these aspects relate to their academic achievement and experiences through the fifth grade. 1 The birth cohort study (ECLS-B) focuses on those characteristics of children and their families, as well as children's early health care and in-home and out-of-home experiences, that relate to children's first experiences with the demands of formal school (i.e., kindergarten and first grade). It provides important information about the way America raises, nurtures, and prepares its children for school. This study was designed to inform an array of issues and research questions pertaining to children's early education, development, and care. Issues that can be addressed over the life of the study include: What role do fathers play in early child care and child-rearing and how does their involvement with their children and the family relate to children's school readiness? What role do resident and nonresident fathers play? Are there characteristics of fathers that are associated with individual differences in children's preparedness for school, independent of mother characteristics?"}, {"section_title": "The Current Study", "text": "The ECLS-B is a nationally representative sample of the nearly 4 million children born in the United States in the year 2001. 2 During the first wave of the study, 10,688 parents provided information and 10,221 children were directly assessed. The parent weight (WIR0) is the weight used to produce all estimates in this report. Only those cases with completed parent interviews are included in this weight. 3 Since the sampled children were born between January and December 2001, baseline data were collected on a rolling basis between the fall of 2001 and the fall of 2002. The ECLS-B was designed to collect information from children and their families for the first time when the children were about 9 months of age (i.e., 8 to 10 months). However, information was collected from a few children as young as 6 months and as old as 22 months. The term \"9 months\" is used throughout this document to refer to the data collection that took place between fall 2001 and fall 2002, at which time most of the sampled children were about 9 months of age (72 percent of the population was 8 to 10 months of age) (table 1). For ease of reporting, this E.D. TAB uses the term \"about 9 months of age\" to refer to the entire population of children in the study. Four additional waves of data collection are planned for when the children are 2-year-olds, preschool-aged (e.g., age 4), and then when they are in kindergarten and first grade. Overall, 74.1 percent of the children in the sample participated in the study. For more information on response rates, data reliability, and test procedures, please refer to appendix A.

The report profiles data from a nationally representative sample of children at about 9 months of age both overall, and for various subgroups (i.e., male and female, children from different racial/ethnic groups, and children living in different types of families). The information in this report is presented in four sections: (1) characteristics of the children and their families; (2) children's early mental and physical skills; (3) children's first experiences in child care; and (4) the fathers of these children.

When these children were about 9 months of age (table 3) \u25a0 23 percent were living in families whose household income was below the poverty threshold; \u25a0 64 percent were living with both of their married biological parents, 14 percent were living with unmarried biological parents, and 20 percent were living with one parent (figure 3); \u25a0 27 percent were living with mothers who had less than a high school education, and 17 percent were living with fathers who had less than a high school education; and \u25a0 24 percent were living with mothers who had a bachelor's degree or higher, and 24 percent were living with fathers who had a bachelor's degree or higher.      \u25a0 Early Problem Solving. The child is using reasoning to interact with objects (e.g., if a toy is out of reach, using another object, like another toy, to bring the desired toy within reach). \u25a0 Communicating With Words. The child understands and uses words, both receptively (pointing to named objects) and expressively (saying words). Below are the five proficiencies for early physical skills."}, {"section_title": "\u25a0", "text": "Eye-hand Coordination. The child demonstrates eye-hand coordination as he/she reaches for objects.\nSitting. The child can sit alone, without leaning against something or other assistance.\nPrewalking. The child is taking steps and supporting his/her weight while standing, with assistance (moving along furniture or holding onto someone's hand). \u25a0 Independent Walking. The child is walking alone, without assistance (without holding onto something or someone).     \nWhen children were about 9 months of age, approximately one-half (50 percent) were in some kind of regular child care arrangement, such as a center-based care arrangement or care provided by a nonrelative or relative in a private home (figure 6, table 6). \u25a0 Black children (63 percent) were more likely to be in some kind of child care arrangement, compared to White (49 percent), Hispanic (46 percent), and Asian children (47 percent). Children whose mothers work (full time or part time) are more likely to be in child care than children whose mothers do not work or who are looking for work. Children in families who were not poor (at or above the poverty threshold) (52 percent) were more likely to be in child care than children from poor families (43 percent) (table 6). -26 percent were in relative care as their primary arrangement, 10 where they received care from someone related to them other than the parent, such as a grandparent, aunt, uncle, sibling, or some other relative. Relative care could be in the child's home or in the home of the caregiver. -15 percent were in nonrelative care as their primary arrangement, care provided by someone who is not related to them, such as a nanny, home-based care provider, regular sitter, or neighbor. This does not include day care centers or preschools. The care could be in the child's home or in the home of the caregiver. -9 percent were in center-based care as their primary arrangement, such as early learning centers, nursery schools, and preschools (including Early Head Start). -1 percent had a primary arrangement that was actually multiple arrangements, where they spent equal numbers of hours across different care arrangement types (such as 20 hours a week with a relative and 20 hours a week in a center-based program).\nThe type of child care children receive varied by their race/ethnicity. Black children were more likely than White, Hispanic, or Asian children to be in center-based care. White children were less likely than Black, Hispanic, or Asian children to be cared for by a relative (table 6).\nOf children in child care, 39 percent began when they were younger than 3 months, 47 percent were three to six months old, and 14 percent started care when they were older than 6 months (figure 7, table 7). In terms of hours per week in child care, 19 percent of children about 9 months of age were in an arrangement 10 hours or fewer, 27 percent were in an arrangement 11 to 30 hours, 31 percent were in an arrangement 31 to 40 hours, and 24 percent were in an arrangement more than 40 hours (table 7).\nThe age at which children entered child care and the number of hours they spent in the arrangement varied by their race/ethnicity. Asian children were more likely than White, Black, or Hispanic children to enter a child care arrangement when they were younger than 3 months of age. Asian children were more likely than White, Black, or Hispanic children to spend more than 40 hours a week in care, and Black children were more likely than White or Hispanic children to spend more than 40 hours a week in care.\nChildren in relative care were more likely to be in care for 10 hours or fewer a week than children in nonrelative care or a center-based program. Children in multiple care arrangements were more likely to be in care more than 40 hours a week than children in a single care arrangement.   Care arrangement \nFather Questionnaires. Although the information in this E.D. TAB comes largely from the child assessment and the parent interview, the ECLS-B also collected data from fathers directly through two separate father questionnaires: the resident father questionnaire and the nonresident father questionnaire. Both father questionnaires were self-administered with telephone follow up. The father questionnaires were available in English and Spanish. For more information on any of the components of the ECLS-B, please refer to the ECLS-B 9-month Data File User's Manual. 14\n\n\n\nFamily type [derived from: X1MARSTA; P1PARTNR; P1NFTHHH] In order to construct this family type variable, information from X1MARSTA (marital status of parent-married, separated, divorced, widowed), P1PARTNR (spouse or partner living in the household), and P1NFTHHH (confirmation of biological father not living in household) was used. Married, two biological parents includes biological mothers and biological fathers who are married. Married, two parents includes biological mother and other father, biological father and other mother, two adoptive parents, or two same sex parents. Cohabiting, two biological parents includes unmarried biological mother and father. Cohabiting, two parents includes unmarried biological mother and other father, biological father and other mother, or two same sex parents. Single parent live alone includes a single biological mother, a single biological father or a single adoptive parent. Other (guardian) includes related guardians or unrelated guardians, and/or foster parents. Information on father education was collected directly from fathers. If the father was the respondent to the parent interview, the information from the parent interview was used. If the father was not the respondent to the parent interview, information from the father questionnaires was used. If the father was not the respondent to the parent interview and father education was missing on the father questionnaires, information on father education provided by the respondent to the parent interview was used.This variable includes only birth, adoptive, step-, or foster fathers residing in the household. For example, if the child did not have birth, adoptive, step-, or foster parents but was living with another relative (such as an aunt) who served as the parent respondent, the education of the relative and his or her spouse was not used in the creation of the composites. At 9 months of age, less than one percent of the children did not have at least one parent in the household. The composite variable X1ASAGE defines child's age at assessment in terms of the child's chronological age in decimal months. If the child's date of birth on the birth record was determined to be correct by the parent respondent, then the child's age was calculated by determining the number of days between the date when the child completed the ECLS-B direct child assessments and the child's date of birth indicated on the birth record. If the child's date of birth on the birth record was determined to be incorrect by the parent respondent, then the child's age was calculated by determining the number of days between the date when the child completed the direct child assessment and the child's date of birth reported in the parent CAPI instrument. The total number of days was then divided by 30 to calculate the age in months.\n\n\nThe mental scale includes items designed to assess early cognitive and language ability. These included memory, means-end behavior (e.g., ringing a bell to hear a sound), problem solving, concept attainment, exploration of objects, and preverbal communication (both vocalizations and gestures). Children were presented with tasks such as putting blocks in a cup, ringing a bell, and responding to a parent's request (e.g., peek-a-boo). The main factor assessed by the mental scale is general mental ability. The reliability of the estimate of the 9-month BSF-R mental scale (IRT-based theta) was .79.\nThe motor scale includes items designed to assess gross and fine motor skills (e.g., picking up objects, crawling, walking), perceptual-motor integration, and problem solving. Children participated in tasks such as picking up small objects, grasping a pencil, rolling over from being on their backs, sitting and standing unsupported, and walking with help. The reliability of the estimate of the 9-month BSF-R motor scale (IRT-based theta) was .92."}, {"section_title": "Percentage of children demonstrating specific cognitive abilities", "text": "\n"}, {"section_title": "Percentage of children demonstrating specific motor abilities", "text": "\n"}, {"section_title": "Children's First Experiences in Child Care", "text": "As part of the parent interview, information was collected on children's first experiences in child care.

According to the child's mother, when there was no resident biological father in the household (table 9) -40 percent of young children had contact with their father the same day as the home visit (when the parent interview was conducted); -38 percent of children had contact with their father within 2 to 7 days of the home visit; -7 percent of children had contact with their father within the last 8 to 14 days of the home visit; -2 percent of children had not seen their father in more than 2 weeks; and -13 percent of children had never seen their father.    Interviews. Parents/guardians were asked to provide key information about their children and themselves on such topics as family demographics (e.g., age, relation to child, race/ethnicity), family structure (household members and composition), parent attitudes, home educational activities, child care experience, child development and health, and parental education and employment status. In 99 percent of the cases, the biological mother was the parent respondent completing the interview. The parent interview included two instruments: the parent interview instrument and the parent self-administered questionnaire (PSAQ). The first was conducted in person by trained field interviewers using computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) as part of the home visit. The PSAQ was a paper-andpencil instrument, presented during the parent CAPI instrument for the respondent to complete and return in a provided envelope, and contained 23 questions on topics some people might prefer to answer privately. The parent interviews were conducted primarily in English, but provisions were made to interview parents who spoke other languages. Bilingual interviewers were trained to conduct the parent interview in either English or Spanish. A Spanish CAPI instrument was used when needed as the parent CAPI instrument was programmed in both English and Spanish. An interpreter, either a community or household member, was used for families who spoke languages other than English or Spanish. Fewer than 0.1 percent of the cases were not completed due to language difficulties."}, {"section_title": "Response Rates", "text": "The ECLS-B is a nationally representative sample of the nearly 4 million children born in the United States in the year 2001. The response rate for the 9-month data collection was 74.1 percent, based on weighted data (i.e., using the base weights). The response rate is the number of completed parent interviews divided by the total eligible sample. To be considered complete, the first three sections of the parent interview had to be completed."}, {"section_title": "Data Reliability", "text": "With the exception of key variables the ECLS-B does not impute. The item response rate for all variables used in this report exceeded 90 percent. Estimates produced using data from the ECLS-B are subject to two types of error, sampling and nonsampling errors. Nonsampling errors are errors made in the collection and processing of data. Sampling errors occur because the data are collected from a sample rather than a census of the population. Nonsampling Errors. Nonsampling error is the term used to describe variations in the estimates that may be caused by population coverage limitations, as well as data collection, processing, and reporting procedures. The sources of nonsampling errors are typically problems like unit and item nonresponse, the differences in respondents' interpretations of the meaning of the questions, response differences related to the particular time the survey was conducted, and mistakes in data preparation. In general, it is difficult to identify and estimate either the amount of nonsampling error or the bias caused by this error. In the ECLS-B, efforts were made to prevent such errors from occurring and to compensate for them where possible. The design phase entailed a pilot test of the Bayley Short Form-Research Edition (BSF-R) and a field test that evaluated the implementation of the study. In the main study administration of the BSF-R, there was rigorous training, certification, and monitoring of the assessors administering the instrument. Another potential source of nonsampling error is respondent bias that occurs when respondents systematically misreport (intentionally or unintentionally) information in a study. One potential source of respondent bias in this survey is social desirability bias. If there are no systematic differences among specific groups under study in their tendency to give socially desirable responses, then comparisons of the different groups will accurately reflect differences among the groups. An associated error occurs when respondents give unduly positive assessments about those close to them. For example, parents may give higher assessments of their children's motor accomplishments (like feeding themselves) than might be obtained from direct assessment. Readers should be aware that respondent bias may be present in this survey as in any survey. It is not possible to state precisely how such bias may affect the results. NCES has tried to minimize some of these biases by conducting one-on-one, untimed assessments, and by asking some of the same questions about the sampled child of both the mother and father (e.g., activities the father engages in with the child). The analysis benefited from the unusually rich information available on the frame. The birth record contains a number of important variables on the mother and the child that support many comparisons between respondents and nonrespondents. Findings from these analyses suggest that there is not a bias due to nonresponse. The standard error is a measure of variability due to sampling when estimating a statistic. Standard errors for estimates presented in this report were computed using a jackknife replication method. Standard errors can be used as a measure for the precision expected from a particular sample. The probability that a complete census count would differ from the sample estimate by less than 1 standard error is 68 percent. The chance that the difference would be less than 1.65 standard errors is about 90 percent, and that the difference would be less than 1.96 standard errors, about 95 percent. In order to produce national estimates from the ECLS-B data collected during the 9-month data collection, the sample data were weighted. Weighting the data adjusts for unequal selection probabilities at the child level and the weights are adjusted for unit nonresponse. The parent weight (W1R0), which is the weight used to produce all estimates found in this report, is the weight that accounts for the probability of selection in the sample as well as nonresponse to the parent interview. Only those cases with completed parent interviews in the 9-month data collection are included in this weight. A parent interview is considered complete if the first three sections were finished (IN, FS, CD In addition to properly weighting the responses, special procedures for estimating the statistical significance of the estimates were employed because the data were collected using a complex sample design. Complex sample designs, like that used in the ECLS-B, result in data that violate the assumptions that are normally required to assess the statistical significance of the results. Frequently, the standard errors of the estimates are larger than would be expected if the sample was a simple random sample and the observations were independent and identically distributed random variables. Replication methods of variance estimation were used to reflect the actual sample design used in the ECLS-B. A form of the jackknife replication method (JK2) using 84 replicate weights was used to compute approximately unbiased estimates of the standard errors of the estimates in the report, using WesVar version 4.0. Jackknife methods were used to estimate the precision of the estimates of the reported national percentages and means. The standard errors of the estimates are presented in appendix B of this E.D.
