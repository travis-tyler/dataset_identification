Seagrass meadows enhance biodiversity (Hughes et al. 2002;Lubbers et al. 1990;Wyda et al. 2002), attenuate wave energy (Fonseca and Cahalan 1992;Koch 2001), stabilize sediments (Fonseca and Fisher 1986), sequester carbon and nutrients (Pedersen et al. 1999;Touchette and Burkholder 2000), oxygenate sediments and filter the water column (Short and Short 1984). Meadows and patches create important coastal habitats, providing shelter and forage for many marine fish species (Heck et al. 1989;Lubbers et al. 1990). As estuarine plants, seagrasses are useful indicators of estuarine health as they are subject to anthropogenic and environmental stresses. These stresses include light limitation caused by nutrient loading (Lee et al. 2007, Short et al. 1995, Dennison et al. 1993), development-related habitat loss Burdick 1996, Landry andGolden 2017), disease (Bull et al. 2012, Muehlstein 1989, and climate change (Thom et al. 2014, Echavarria-Heras et al. 2006. Seagrasses are used as an indicator of estuary health, therefore monitoring programs help to enhance the protection and management of seagrass beds (Orth et al. 2006). Because of the importance and vulnerability of seagrasses, programs that monitor their extent or health have been increasing world-wide during the last two decades (Orth et al. 2006). The predominant seagrass in New England is Zostera marina, known commonly as eelgrass. Currently, the primary eelgrass survey effort in Massachusetts is a fixed-wing aerial photography survey conducted by the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) (Costello and Kenworthy 2011). The DEP Eelgrass Mapping Project is conducted yearly in selected embayments and sections of the coastline, providing nearly coast-wide coverage approximately every five years. Their survey includes aerial photo interpretation along with groundtruthing with underwater video to spot-check the aerial imagery analysis. Since the DEP eelgrass survey only provides updates every five years, and the imagery is captured at a 1:20,000 scale, it is not well suited for tracking detailed spatial patterns within seagrass meadows, especially in patchy dynamic beds or in estuaries that are turbid. This can make it difficult to address specific environmental issues that may lead to uncertainty in the rate of change in eelgrass meadows and the causes of meadow decline (Neckles et al. 2012, Valle et al. 2015. Other mapping efforts include ad-hoc sidescan acoustic surveys conducted by MA DMF which also include underwater photo groundtruthing, and also have their limitations. In general, seagrass surveys can be divided into three scale categories: 1. Broad-scale remote sensing studies using fixed-wing aerial photography, Landsat satellite imagery (Hogrefe et al. 2014, O'Neill andCosta 2013), drone imagery (Duffy et al. 2018), or acoustic mapping are typically designed to assess regional changes in spatial distribution. See Appendix A for a literature review of broad-scale survey methods. 2. Meso-scale surveys are designed to assess single embayment and/or meadow-level changes in eelgrass spatial distribution and some can roughly track health-related changes like density, percent cover and canopy height. Examples of meso-scale monitoring include acoustic surveys (Vandermeulen 2014, Sonoki et al. 2016, randomized quadrat-based surveys (Neckles et al. 2012, Raposa andBradley 2010), underwater camera and benthic grab surveys (McKenzie 2003), and towed video surveys (Berry et al. 2003). See Appendix B for a literature review of meso-scale survey methods. 3. Fine-scale surveys use high resolution monitoring to identify meadow and patch-level changes and responses to stressors to inform system-wide trends. These programs often require SCUBA or snorkel work at permanent monitoring sites, which cover a very small study area in comparison to broad and meso-scale surveys (Short et al. 2006, Neckles et al. 2012. See Appendix C for a literature review of fine-scale survey methods. In the Duxbury-Kingston-Plymouth embayment (DKP), broad-scale surveys have detected large declines in eelgrass extent and density over the last several decades, with further losses documented using acoustic surveys done in between aerial survey time periods (Costello andKenworthy 2011, Ford andCarr 2016). However, the cause and longevity of these losses are unclear, though likely associated with a mix of geomorphological processes, physical impacts, climate, and water quality. Therefore, in DKP more frequent meadow-level data collection is needed to supplement existing mapping programs and inform the overall understanding of the embayment. Informed by extensive expert input, this protocol was developed to provide a methodology that can be applied by an engaged group of citizen scientists. Citizen science has recently expanded into the field of seagrass research, and volunteers can help collect, process and analyze data in a variety of ways (Jones et al. 2017). Marine benthic projects that rely on citizen scientists include Seagrass-Watch (McKenzie et al. 2003), Reef Life Survey (Stuart-Smith et al. 2017) and Seagrass Spotter (seagrassspotter.org). Monitoring methods include satellite photo analysis (blog.floatingforests.org), use of submersible cameras (Raoult et al. 2016, Wright et al. 2015) and data collection by divers (Stuart-Smith et al. 2017, Roelfsema et al. 2016 for Seagrass)."}, {"section_title": "Goals", "text": "The overarching goal is to better understand and track changes to eelgrass bed extent and condition in DKP. When these datasets are considering alongside potential stressors, managers and stewards are in a better position to effectively manage and protect the resource. The specific goals of the citizen science monitoring protocol include documentation of eelgrass presence or absence and percent cover across the embayment, and assessment of eelgrass health in terms of canopy height, epiphyte coverage, and wasting disease presence at discrete indicator beds."}, {"section_title": "Quadrat-based Photo Monitoring", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "What?", "text": "This sampling protocol is focused on creating an annual assessment of eelgrass using underwater photo monitoring, and has been informed by Neckles et al. (2012). This protocol is designed to be used by volunteers and scientists, focusing on meso-scale survey data collection that provides a rapid assessment of eelgrass coverage and plant characteristics throughout the embayment, with more intensive sampling at indicator areas. A meeting convening eelgrass experts took place on 1/31/18 in Kingston to discuss monitoring methodology options in DKP (meeting notes in Appendix D). This protocol is based upon feedback received during that meeting, and the final document was reviewed by the expert group to ensure consensus with the methodology."}, {"section_title": "Who?", "text": "Monitoring will be conducted by trained volunteers with no previous data collection experience necessary. Volunteers will be solicited by the local watershed group, North & South Rivers Watershed Association (NSRWA), which also hosts the South Shore Regional Coordinator for MassBays. The first year of protocol implementation will be dedicated to training and testing the method while collecting data. Prior to sampling, an onsite training session will be provided by MA DMF and MassBays. Teams of 2-3 volunteers will work aboard watercraft under supervision and operation of MA DMF and MassBays in addition to any volunteer-provided watercraft. In future years, it is the intent that volunteer-provided watercraft can accommodate all sampling needs. Most powerboats and small engineless boats nine feet or greater can accommodate the sampling gear. Sampling from a kayak or small canoe is not recommended due to the lack of deck space and stability."}, {"section_title": "When?", "text": "Sampling will be conducted over a single sampling week (a blitz) to reduce environmental or other fluctuations as much as possible. In the first year, the blitz will be a multi-day effort where supervised volunteer teams are deployed to sample all of the designated monitoring stations. In order to ensure proper data collection and management, and since sampling is targeting a single point in time instead of season-wide, a blitz approach was determined to be the most efficient sampling scheme. The first year of sampling will inform the level of effort (e.g. number of people, boats and sea-days) needed for future years. Monitoring should take place during the peak growing season for eelgrass when leaf biomass is at its highest, preferably in August. If possible, the same approximate dates should be targeted each year. While no designated tidal stage is required, it is important for samplers to consider depth at tidal stage in their sampling area, as some monitoring stations may be too shallow or too deep to access at certain tides. Time of day should also be considered, as water clarity monitoring via secchi disk must be done between 10am and 4pm. Monitoring of all stations should take place ideally annually but at least every other year to detect acute changes to eelgrass beds."}, {"section_title": "Where?", "text": "The DKP embayment was first divided into the two major sub-embayments of Duxbury and Plymouth Harbors as defined in the DEP 305b Integrated List of Waters layer (available on MassGIS). Within the two subembayments, a stratified random site selection was done using eelgrass persistence and sub-embayment as the strata. At the 1/31/2018 meeting, experts agreed that randomized site selection within suitable habitat areas would give a monitoring program the greatest statistical strength, and would help to answer the questions of where eelgrass still exists, if it returns to areas it has previously disappeared from, and if gross changes to coverage and condition are observable across the embayment. Other site selection models were investigated including randomly located transects, sampling based on a tessellated or grid pattern, and simple random point sampling. These methods were ultimately disregarded because they required too many sampling locations, resulted in over-or under-sampling certain areas of interest, or were not conducive to a volunteer boat and camera based program. Stratified random sampling can provide population estimates for each of the strata, allowing comparison between them, and has the potential to increase precision due to lower standard errors (Levy and Lemeshow 2008). We first looked at relevant layers pertaining to habitat suitability including bathymetry, sediment type, and presence of previously mapped eelgrass (Appendix E). Other datasets relevant to habitat suitability that were not incorporated due to lack of data include fetch and long-term water quality. All analyses were completed in ArcGIS 10.5. The stratification was focused by sub-embayment (Duxbury and Plymouth Harbors) and presence of previously mapped eelgrass. Bathymetry was used to limit the study area to depths suitable for eelgrass. Sediment type wasn't used since 95% of the embayment has the same sediment type (sand). To limit the study area to depths suitable for eelgrass, USGS LIDAR data (downloaded from www.sciencebase.gov) were extracted as a raster and converted to points where eelgrass had been previously mapped by DEP's mapping program. Using these points, a histogram was generated to assess the minimum and maximum depths where eelgrass had been identified. Depth contours were then generated using the Create Contour tool at these minimum and maximum depths and used to clip the study area. Mapped aquaculture grant sites were removed from the study area, as were portions of the embayment that are particularly difficult to sample (e.g. very shallow innermost harbors). Manual smoothing of the boundary was done since some boundaries were excessively complicated as a result of the contour line drawing on the raster LIDAR surface. Three strata were then delineated using an assessment of the frequency in which eelgrass had been identified at a location in the past. The DEP eelgrass polygons from 1995, 2001, 2006, 2012, and 2015 were used to generate raster layers at 27 m 2 cell resolution (all rasters were snapped to the 1995 base layer) and each layer had a cell value of \"1\" for an area with eelgrass and \"NoData\" for an area without eelgrass. These layers were then summed using the Cell Statistics tool. The resulting map indicated cells that had been identified as eelgrass once, twice, three times, four times, or five times by the DEP mapping program. This map was merged with the study area map, and all remaining areas were coded as \"Never Identified.\" The three primary stratification units were defined where eelgrass was \"Identified 4-5 Times\", \"Identified 1-3 Times\", and \"Never Identified\". Because the \"Identified 4-5 Times\" stratum indicates high eelgrass persistence across DEP's survey, sampling stations selected in this stratum are categorized as \"indicator sites\", suggesting that changes at these stations may be indicative of changes to the greater meadow or embayment. In order to distribute random samples into each of the six strata (the three eelgrass frequencies in both Plymouth and Duxbury Bays), it was decided to split the samples by each eelgrass frequency unit as follows: The least degree of variation in eelgrass presence/absence is expected to occur in the stratum where eelgrass has never been identified but habitat may be suitable, therefore this stratum received the lowest proportion of samples (n=30, or 20% of the total samples). To populate the remaining strata, several different split options were explored. Ultimately, while variation has the potential to be highest in the beds of questionable persistence (identified 1-3 times), it is important to adequately sample the most persistent beds since they will act as indicators of change. Therefore, the remaining samples (n=120 or 80% of the total) were equally distributed between these two strata. The ET GeoWizards tool Random Points in Polygons was used to distribute the samples with a minimum distance to the boundary of each polygon of 25 meters to account for unreliable edge data. The resulting sampling stations (n=150) appear well distributed and meet our goals for safety, access and randomness (Appendix F). The same stations will be sampled each survey year to detect changes in eelgrass presence or condition. In the first year, sampling will take place at up to an additional 100 locations to allow for a post-sampling power analysis that will help determine if a statistically suitable number of stations have been sampled. The organizer may decide to assign specific stations to specific sampling teams based on the volunteer team's available resources (boat type, access, preferred launch site, etc). This approach may also serve to increase ownership of the stations and those eelgrass beds."}, {"section_title": "How?", "text": "Training will be provided prior to sampling, and all monitoring will be done in accordance with the Division of Marine Fisheries Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for Citizen Science Eelgrass Monitoring (Appendix G). Volunteers (and organizers, in year one) will provide a stable vessel with standard safety equipment. Monitoring kits will be provided by MassBays/MA DMF to each volunteer team and will contain all equipment needed for sampling (Appendix H). Targeting the hours between 10 am and 4 pm during August, volunteers will navigate to each of the stations using provided GPS coordinates. Once anchored, volunteers will follow the SOP to record water clarity using a secchi disk, collect photos of the eelgrass in a quadrat placed on the seafloor, and record percent cover. The photo-sampling will be repeated at four corners of the boat to create replicates and improve statistical strength of the survey. At designated indicator stations, additional sampling will include conducting four plant grabs to record leaf measurements, collecting sample photos and assessing disease and epiphytes. See Appendix G for a detailed step-by-step field protocol with visual guides, and Appendix I for Field Datasheets. Data obtained from the underwater photographs and eelgrass samples taken at indicator stations include presence/absence of eelgrass, percent cover, and canopy height, as well as presence or absence of wasting disease and epiphytes. Additional data to be collected include topside information (date, time, names of volunteers, and weather conditions), water depth and secchi depth readings. All data will be recorded on the paper data sheets provided, which will then be submitted along with photos to the appropriate location per the Data Management section below. To assist in the collection of these data, laminated SOPs for all methods, visual guides and equipment are available in the monitoring kit. The protocol in Appendix G uses commonly measured parameters as indicators of eelgrass structure and function (Evans and Short 2005). Eelgrass canopy height changes seasonally and responds to water quality and periods of low light. Therefore, changes in canopy height may be indicative of stress in a system (Olesen and Sand-Jensen 1993). Likewise, epiphyte coverage and wasting disease both limit photosynthesis and therefore can serve as a proxy for plant fitness (Broderson et al. 2015;Burdick et al. 1993). Tracking wasting disease coverage may help researchers understand certain trends in eelgrass loss. A secchi disk is used to measure water transparency, which is important as it relates to light available for plant growth. The secchi depth is the depth at which a weighted black and white disk is just visible through the water column, corresponding to the depth at which approximately 10% of the surface light remains (Wetzel 1983). The relationship between secchi depth and the light attenuation of Photosynthetically Active Radiation, the portion of the light spectrum used by plants, is nonlinear and dependent on particles and color in the water column that effects how light is absorbed or scattered (Holmes 1970). However, secchi depth commonly serves as an index of water quality. Light availability is recognized as the most important factor regulating eelgrass depth limits (Olsen and Sand -Jensen 1993) and eelgrass requires between 11 and 33% of surface light to thrive (Ochieng et al. 2009). Therefore, secchi depth measurements may help inform if changes in light conditions are taking place spatially or temporally. The use of a \"view bucket\" or \"look box\" in combination with the secchi disc helps to reduce glare and light refraction off the water leading to a more accurate and consistent secchi depth reading."}, {"section_title": "Data management", "text": "For the first year of sampling, data will be collected using the provided datasheets (Appendix I), provided in the monitoring kit. For future years, an app may be developed that will facilitate data collection via a tablet or smartphone. Photos are collected onto the SD card in the camera. The organizer will meet the sampling teams at the beginning of each day to provide kits and blank SD cards. At the end of each sampling day, paper datasheets and camera SD cards will be turned in to the organizer (Sara Grady at NSRWA/MassBays). The organizer will scan and save the sheets and file the paper copies as soon as possible. The photos will be downloaded from the SD cards into a designated electronic folder. Photo file dates and times will be verified to be accurate. If they are not accurate, they must be placed in a subfolder named with the correct date and the sampling team (e.g. 08202018_team4) to minimize file confusion. Other processing steps that should be done soon after sampling are as follows: 1. Data from the paper datasheets is entered in an Excel database and each entry checked for quality control (QC) by a second person. 2. Review the photos from each station. Delete extra photos (no more than two representative photos for each sample are recommended) and rename photos with the date, station and sample number (e.g."}, {"section_title": "Station5quad_Sample2_082018, or Station5anchor_Sample2_08202018", "text": "). There will be at least four quadrat photos at every station plus an additional four anchor-collected sample photos taken at certain stations, so proper file organization is important to avoid confusion. 3. Back up all datasheets and photos to an online cloud storage service such as Dropbox, OneDrive, or Google Drive. All of these tasks can be completed by the organizer or a volunteer specifically trained in the management of these files. Another important form of QC is the periodic spot-checking of the collected data by visually comparing the eelgrass percent cover reported on the datasheet to the underwater photos collected during sampling. In the first year, QC should be done for all data collected at all stations. Subsequent years that involve repeatvolunteers might require less QC, at the organizer's discretion. If concerning mischaracterizations are found during QC, retraining should take place with the appropriate samplers, and the organizer should determine whether the images should be reprocessed and the data updated. When all data are entered, analysis can take many forms: a spatial display of presence and absence across the embayment, analysis of variables by indicator bed, and integration with other mapping and water quality data. As with all sampling, it is important to have a way to measure the success of an effort. In this project, success of the first year of sampling will be evaluated based on whether or not all stations were sampled as described and all parameters were able to be sampled. Volunteers will be solicited for feedback based on their experience. Following the first year, completion of a power analysis will help determine if an adequate number of stations were sampled. Protocol issues that may not be improved through experience will necessitate a reevaluation of the methodology."}, {"section_title": "Other Recommendations", "text": "In addition to the citizen science protocol described above and in the appendices, we provide these additional recommendations regarding eelgrass monitoring in DKP: Broad-scale recommendations: MA DMF recommend the continuation of the long-running, carefully standardized survey that DEP's eelgrass mapping program oversees for broad-scale surveying of eelgrass spatial extent in DKP. Other methods should continue to be experimentally explored (e.g. U.S. EPA satellite imagery studies). If a more efficient methodology is developed, it should be standardized to the DEP mapping methods. Meso-scale recommendations: MA DMF recommends a meso-scale survey effort in DKP that combines periodic acoustic surveys and the quadrat-based photo survey described herein. Acoustic surveys should be performed biennially or as funding allows, following the MA DMF Guidelines (available upon request). It is likely that the quadrat-based survey can indicate areas of interest where the acoustic survey should be focused. Fine-scale recommendations: The recommended fine-scale strategy for the DKP embayment is the establishment of a SeagrassNet site. SeagrassNet is a scientific global seagrass monitoring program that combines plant collection, underwater surveys, and photography into a standardized protocol (Short et al. 2006). By utilizing this standardized protocol, acute changes in specific beds of interest in DKP may be identified and compared to changes to other eelgrass beds monitored with the same methodology locally, regionally and internationally.  1855 are now captured by airplanes and drones Grant 2015, Nahirnick et al. 2017). Remote sensing using satellites started in the 1960s by the military has expanded to methods also using aircrafts and drones."}, {"section_title": "Closing Remarks & Acknowledgements", "text": "There are advantages and disadvantages to both aerial photographs and satellite imagery of subtidal habitats. While satellite imagery is more cost effective and time efficient for rapid, repeated observations over large regions, it typically provides lower resolution than aerial photographs (Larsen et al. 2004;Chandler et al. 2002) and there is less control over the ambient environmental conditions. The interpreter of satellite images has to account for atmospheric interferences, variability in water depth and bottom albedo, water column attenuation by scattering and absorption, and bottom reflectance variability (Cho et al. 2012;Haddad and Harris 1985;Ferguson et aI. 1993;Jensen et al. 1987). Similarly the interpreter for aerial photography needs to account for environmental conditions such as low altitude atmospheric conditions, sea state, water clarity, and water depth (Dobson et al. 1995). Aerial photography lends itself to more flexibility in scheduling around the time of day, sensor altitude and flight line placement, unlike satellite imagery which is more opportunistic (Dobson et al. 1995). Since 1995, DEP's Eelgrass Mapping Program has collected aerial photographs and field-groundtruthing data to map eelgrass coverage in coastal waters and therefore characterize overall eelgrass trends. DEP's survey is conducted yearly at select embayments on a rotating schedule, therefore individual embayments are revisited every 3 to 5 years. DEP standardizes image collection to ensure maximum eelgrass visibility, following the Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) standards for aerial photographic surveys for seagrasses (Costello and Kenworthy 2011;Dobson et al. 1995;Finkbeiner et al. 2001). True color aerial photography taken at a scale of 1:20,000 between May and early August requires specific environmental conditions including near to low tide, sun angle <25\u00b0, winds <5 mph, minimal cloud cover, no haze, fog, or rainfall or high winds within the previous 48 hours (Costello and Kenworthy, 2011). DEP collected aerial imagery in DKP in 1995DKP in , 2001DKP in , 2006DKP in , 2012DKP in , and 2015 Delineations based on the aerial photographs are groundtruthed with underwater video surveys. In addition, DEP utilized Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT) photos in an effort to establish an eelgrass baseline for 1951. The 1951 photos were not taken using the same specifications as applied by DEP, but were the earliest and best images available at that time (Ford and Carr 2016). In Massachusetts, a mix of non-profit, Federal, and State agencies have collected aerial photographs to monitor eelgrass beds to provide supplemental perspective of areas of interest seen in DEP images and also help qualitatively assess specific beds between DEP mapping years (Ford and Carr 2016 Orthophotographs, with the metric qualities of a true map, are produced by correcting the oblique images that had distortions due to relief and photo-tilt and lens effects (Wolf 1980;Chandler et al. 2002). Finding an elevated point overlooking the area of interest is the main limitation for this method. A study by Duffy et al. (2018) used a drone and consumer grade cameras to produce very high spatial resolution (~4 mm pixel -1 ) mosaics of intertidal sites in Wales, UK. Drones allow for higher resolution with additional flexibility in deployment capabilities and customization (Duffy et al. 2018). Limitations similar to satellite and aerial photography include turbidity, waves, cloud cover, weather (e.g. rain or fog) and water column height (Andrade and Ferreira 2011;Duffy et al. 2018). Also, drones typically have a short flight time and regulatory operational limitations, so can only be used over small areas."}, {"section_title": "Appendix B: Meso-scale Monitoring", "text": "Meso-scale monitoring usually involves ground-based assessment of a specific embayment or meadow. This level of monitoring can be used to estimate the coverage and quality of seagrass beds at a higher resolution and can include physical, chemical, or biological parameters of the bed (Brooks et al. 2004, Neckles et al. 2012, Hogrefe et al. 2014, Vandermeulen 2014. Detected changes might include density, percent cover, canopy height, sediment characteristics, or observation of changes to algae communities. The information can be used to monitor meadow-scale changes in extent, and to predict or explain changes in areal extent (Hogrefe et al. 2014, Johnson andThedinga 2005). Examples of meso-scale surveys include acoustic remote sensing surveys (Ford and Carr 2016, Vandermeulen 2014, Sonoki et al. 2016, randomized quadrat-based surveys (Neckles et al. 2012, Raposa andBradley 2010), systematic point sampling (Hogrefe et al. 2014), towed underwater video surveys (Berry et al. 2003, Fonseca et al. 2002, Vandermeulen 2014, unmanned surface vehicles (USV) equipped with sidescan sonar sensors (Klemens 2017), and benthic grab surveys (Short and Coles 2001, Norris et al. 2001, Moller and Martin 2007, McKenzie 2003. Remote sensing methods that utilize active sonar (e.g. by emitting pulses of sound) can collect fine-scaled measurements of large seagrass regions, even in deep coastal water (Hossain et al. 2014), while remaining relatively cost-effective and easily repeatable , Neckles et al. 2012. Numerous sonar arrangements are available including echosounders, side-scan sonar and seismic hydrophone systems, of various frequencies and beam counts. Acoustic methods are less affected by water clarity and turbidity compared to photo interpretation methods, and some researchers have been able to produce algorithms to compute canopy height of seagrass beds (Hossain et al. 2014). Generally though, acoustic methods require specialized equipment, trained staff to collect and process the data, and additional time and resources to groundtruth the survey area. Since 2014, MA DMF has conducted three acoustic surveys in DKP. The 2014 survey utilized both echosounder and sidescan sonar equipment and sampled at least one transect through every bed in DKP. Follow-up surveys in 2016 and 2017 utilized only side scan sonar and operated as more of a spot-checking effort, where certain beds of concern were targeted with one to two transects. Ideally, transects should be spaced so that adjacent image swaths overlap by at least 50%, and cover the entirety of the bed. A survey of this magnitude has not been conducted in DKP. Quadrat-based assessments or systematic point sampling from a boat at permanent sampling stations provide an estimate of percent cover and canopy height within a bed and therefore allow users to establish trends in the health and condition of eelgrass beds over time (Neckles et al. 2012, Hogrefe et al. 2014. To measure percent cover an underwater camera takes a picture of a quadrat on the seafloor that is analyzed either in real-time or later in the lab for eelgrass coverage. To measure canopy height, a benthic grab survey is done in which a small anchor is used to collect samples to measure leaf length. The time and resources required for quadrat-based assessments depend on the size of the eelgrass meadow and number of sampling points. Underwater video surveys with 10cm scaling lasers provide accurately scaled images that can be used to estimate percent cover and health of the meadow (Vandermeulen 2014). Underwater videography is useful for deeper and/or larger beds and is better at discerning eelgrass from other vegetation than remote sensing or aerial imagery methods (Berry et al. 2003). However, it requires a trained observer to assess hours of video tape."}, {"section_title": "Appendix C: Fine-scale Monitoring", "text": "Fine-scale monitoring can include many approaches including plant collection, underwater surveys, and photography. Collecting data at this resolution can help identify stressors and their particular impacts on eelgrass. While these efforts cover a very small study area and often require SCUBA and other advanced training, repeated monitoring of plant and habitat parameters provides baseline information and a means of comparison to assess changes in eelgrass (Neckles et al. 2012). Through these approaches, detailed information related to potential impacts can be gathered such as morphological and reproductive condition of plants, presence of grazing, disease, and any other environmental variables (Short & Coles 2001). SeagrassNet is a scientific global seagrass monitoring program that combines plant collection, underwater surveys, and photography into a standardized protocol (Short et al. 2006). By utilizing this standardized protocol, acute changes in specific beds of interest may be identified and compared to changes to other eelgrass beds \uf0b7 Are light conditions favorable, and can monitoring incorporate light and other WQ?

Shaw -Water quality at the CCS monitoring site in 2012 was 0.5 mg/l total nitrogen and the eelgrass threshold is 0.37mg/l, so there may have been stress from increased nitrogen in the systemlook into again, I think DMF found no significance. \uf0b7 Kaitlyn Shaw: Could look at contaminants in the water (pharmaceuticals and others). We have also heard this in the past from aquaculturistsinterest in looking into herbicides, pesticides, fertilizers. o CFCS looked at contaminants in Cape Cod Bay, but not DKP \uf0b7 Weather (Bill Doyle): o Harbor had 18\" of ice in 2014 o Two 100 year storm events in the last few years (Hurricane Sandy, Blizzard'17) o Winds and storm surge caused increased water level for extended period of time and fast outgoing currents o When water receded, extreme currents may have removed sediment/grass o DMF: Wind direction has shifted over time: measurable in weather data, but needs more work \uf0b7 Bathymetry o Dramatic shifts in sediment recentlysome locations gaining 2-3 inches of sediment a year (per aquaculturists) o Scouring observed in some locations o Some areas of loss now appear to be exposed at mean lowcould this have caused some loss? o Changes in bathymetry can occur rapidly when eelgrass/mussels leave an area \uf0b7 Alyssa Novak: Ammonia production from oysters is toxic to eelgrass and could be a contributing factor to the eelgrass decline. No one has looked into this for DKP but we should \uf0b7 Plausible that losses are a result of recruitment issues in the embayment. Should quantify reproductive shoots in monitoring. Maybe it didn't recover due to lack of seeding -Phil \uf0b7 Loss might be due to all of the abovepossibly storms knocked out the eelgrass and then it couldn't rebound due to changes in the habitat suitability, either because of poor water quality or changes in hydrodynamics or other. \uf0b7 80% daily flushing in the system, some think that means it is unlikely to be a nutrient loading issue \uf0b7 Green crabs were noted as a nuisancelocal aquaculturist comment \uf0b7 Chlorophyll data are available from landsat analysisviewed map of DKP showing hot spots (Dante Torio)"}, {"section_title": "Mapping", "text": "Sara Grady presented various mapping approaches seen in the literature. Some studies identify DKP as a macroscale site based on its size (around 39km 2 ), and monitoring in an embayment of this size should be limited to remote-sensing methods. However, we have observed large losses that have raised large questions, which may become elucidated with Tier 2 and 3 monitoring. The tiered approach was presented as a goal, but the floor was opened to other monitoring strategies or methods. There was some discussion about doing multiple transects (using towable cameras or snorkelers) rather than point-locations. Tay Evans also suggested a protocol that would give flexibility to the samplers, for example the drop-frame camera would be the bare minimum, but if samplers were able and interested, they could expand to collect more data by doing snorkel work along transects. There was discussion about installing acoustic mapping equipment on volunteer boats and having them run surveys during their normal operations. While this would collect more data, it would have a heavy training, QA/QC and data processing element, and may result in more sporadic data collection over various spatial and time scales, which would be difficult to interpret. Acoustic surveys require vessels to run around 3-4kts in calm weather conditions, and often multiple passes over the same area may be needed for adequate datathis can be challenging if volunteers are trying to tack the effort onto their other boating needs that day. In general, there was good agreement around using the following tiered approach: Tier 1continued DEP aerial mapping (every 5 yrs) Tier 2 -Neckles (2012) hexagonal grid sampling method with drop-frame camera PLUS continued DMF (or other) acoustic mapping (annually, biennially?) Tier 3establish one SeagrassNet site (3 transects) at a relatively stable bed Other Mapping Thoughts \uf0b7 Fish finder sonarcould volunteers do it instead of DMF? (Juliet Simpson) o Issues with this include standardization of equipment, method of scan, areas scanned etc. see above \uf0b7 Put HOBO's out in the Bay to observe temperature changes (Phil) o According to aquaculturists, Plymouth already has tidbit sensors deployedcollaborate with towns if possible o Check to see if towns would volunteer/contribute to the project at all o Mentioned that Providence Center for Coastal Studies monitors water temp \uf0b7 Tier 3 sitesmore than one necessary for best results? o One real SGN site would allow for results to be given to SGN o Two would allow for a healthy site and a stressed site to see changes over time (Phil) \uf0b7 Volunteers can be used to look at eelgrass that has washed ashore for existence of roots etc. Would this be helpful to the monitoring effort? \uf0b7 Connect with Jarrett Burns at UMB, doing citizen science with kelp \uf0b7 Keep in mind that satellite imagery is constantly improving, and may become more of a tool for eelgrass in the future (Phil C is starting a new project on this) \uf0b7 DEP (Mike McHugh) finds this info very helpfulground efforts can help inform their aerial survey delineations (need more info on what format and what info would be helpful) \uf0b7 Consider having volunteers use YSI's at each site, or have YSI data collection on a separate sampling day \uf0b7 Consider incorporating coring and surface sediment collections. Coring in areas with existing AND historic eelgrass will be very telling. Don't core in bare areas since sediments may have shifted (Alyssa) \uf0b7 Check in on dye study in Plymouth -hasn't happened yet \uf0b7 Susan/Danteconsider ArcGIS online data entry form (but keep access and security in mind) \uf0b7 Include in protocol how to deal with drifting vs anchoring at a site Input provided post-meeting 2/1/18 phone call between J.Carr and Hilary Neckles: \uf0b7 Perfectly OK to reduce total sampling area to eliminate channels and other unsuitable areas. \uf0b7 The Neckles et al (2012) methodology was easier to conduct at Pleasant Bay than Great South Bay due to embayment size. The smaller, the easier. DKP is of similar size to Pleasant Bay. \uf0b7 The method is working really well for them. It is tracking changes in the embayment. \uf0b7 The method is repeated every 3 years. Adding in the index site was very helpful; it identified losses along the deep edge recently. Also ID'd ulva colonization. \uf0b7 At first, it took 3 people about a week to sample 170 hexagons (about half of which were vegetated). Now, with more routine, it takes 2 people just 3 days. Hilary estimates it may be a 6 day task in DKP, to start. \uf0b7 The method would vary depending on the tidal cycle and visibility. In shallow water, they could simply look over the side. Up around 1m deep, they used a view scope. Beyond that, underwater camera. They also incorporated some \"drive-overs\", which were quick checks of areas that were already known to be bare, and quickly confirmed without anchoring and conducting full sampling. \uf0b7 Site selection involved overlaying 500m wide hexagons, and then randomly generating a sampling point within each cell. These sites are revisited with each sampling effort. \uf0b7 For rake sampling, at least 3 terminal shoots were grabbed for canopy height measurements. At deeper sites (need more infohow deep is too deep?), the rake is challenging and the anchor could sometimes be helpful. \uf0b7 Data can inform density changes, and can also produce a % cover map of the embayment. \uf0b7 Target peak canopy height (July/Aug), and target the right tides for the site (ideal timing depends on what depth you are targeting). 2/2/18 email from Forest Schenck to J.Carr \uf0b7 Having citizens collect density data may be problematic due to accuracy and access, but the data could be really informative in understanding bed changes across the embayment \uf0b7 Citizens doing presence/absence, depth and WQ testing along with other ongoing WQ work could help predict seagrass suitability. But are suitability models useful? It's not as though restoration is an immediate plan. \uf0b7 Interesting idea to test suitability by doing test transplants throughout embayment, which may get at questions of habitat suitability as well as responses to stressors.
