[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "This brief report uses data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-99 (ECLS-K) to describe the middle school experiences of the cohort. The ECLS-K followed the educational, socioemotional, and physical development of a nationally representative sample of kindergartners in public and private schools in the United States from the fall of 1998 through the spring of 2007. Information was collected from the children, their parents, their teachers, and school administrators. Since the base-year fall and spring kindergarten  data collection, sample members participated in five more rounds of data collections: fall and spring of first grade (1999)(2000), spring of third grade (2002), spring of fifth grade (2004), and spring of eighth grade (2007). The ECLS-K represents nearly 4 million children who attended kindergarten in the United States in the 1998-99 school year, or attended first grade in the United States in the 1999-2000 school year. 1 About 87 percent of these children were in the eighth grade in 2007; 13 percent were enrolled below eighth grade because they had been retained at least once since kindergarten (see table A-1 for data for this group of students). About one-third of 1 percent of the children had, at some time, been promoted a grade ahead of schedule and were above eighth grade in 2007. This report uses data collected from the final round of the ECLS-K when most of the cohort was in the eighth grade and provides information about their academic achievement, school activities, and educational aspirations. This report is intended to provide a snapshot of the eighth-grade round of the ECLS-K and make the data available to encourage more in-depth analysis of the data using more sophisticated statistical methods. It focuses on multiple aspects of the cohort's middle school years in the spring of the 2007. It presents information about children's overall achievement in reading, mathematics, and science (table 1); attainment of specific reading proficiencies (table 2); attainment of specific mathematics proficiencies (table 3); participation in various school-sponsored activities (table 4); time spent on homework (table 5); and educational aspirations (table 6). Children remained in the sample regardless of their grade level status (i.e., whether or not they repeated or \"skipped\" a grade). Since many of the characteristics examined in this report are related to grade level, estimates are provided separately for three groups of the sample: (1) children who had been retained at some point since kindergarten (i.e., those in seventh grade or below); (2) children in eighth grade; and (3) children who had been promoted ahead of schedule at some point since kindergarten (i.e., those in ninth grade or higher). The majority of the cohort was promoted on schedule, and for these eighth-graders, the estimates in the tables are presented by various child and family characteristics. Readers are cautioned not to draw causal inferences based on the results presented. It is important to note that many of the variables examined in this report may be related to one another, and complex interactions and relationships among the variables were not explored in this report. The variables examined here are just a few of the several thousand that can be examined in these data; they were selected to demonstrate some of the information available from the study. These findings are examples of estimates that can be obtained from the data and are not designed to emphasize any particular issue. All comparisons referred to in the text were tested for statistical significance to ensure that the differences were larger than might be expected due to sampling variation. All differences reported are significant at the p < .05 level. Adjustments were not made for multiple comparisons. In this report, a \"substantive difference\" is defined as a percentage point difference of 5 points or greater, or a mean score difference of one-fifth of a standard deviation or more. Differences discussed in the text of this report are both statistically significant and substantive. Appendix A provides technical documentation for the estimates presented in this report, a glossary describing the variables, and general information about the study. Additional information about the study can be found online at http://nces.ed.gov/ecls/kindergarten.asp. Appendix B reports the standard errors for tables 1 through 6."}, {"section_title": "Selected Findings", "text": "Academic achievement. Cohort members in eighth grade whose mothers had higher levels of education had higher scores on measures of reading, mathematics and science compared to their peers whose mothers had lower levels of education (table 1). This pattern was apparent between each level of maternal education (less than high school completion, high school diploma or equivalent, some college or vocational technical degree, bachelor's degree or higher). For example, cohort members in eighth grade whose mothers did not complete high school scored, on average, 147 on the reading battery, those whose mothers had completed high school had an average score of 163, children whose mothers had attended some college had an average score of 170, and children whose mothers had earned at least a bachelor's degree had an average score of 184. This pattern between achievement and maternal education was also apparent for both mathematics and science (table 1). Furthermore, maternal education was positively associated with the performance of cohort members in eighth grade on specific reading and mathematics proficiency skill levels (tables 2 and 3). School-sponsored activities. Sixty percent of cohort members in eighth grade reported that they participated in school-sponsored sports, 41 percent in school-sponsored drama or music activities, and 33 percent in a school club (table 4). A higher percentage of Whites, Blacks, and Other, non-Hispanics 2 reported playing school sports (64, 59, and 67 percent respectively) compared to Hispanics (52 percent). A smaller percentage of Asians reported playing school sports (42 percent) compared to White, Black, Hispanic, and Other, non-Hispanic children (52 to 67 percent). A higher percentage of Whites (45 percent) and Asians (46 percent) reported participating in drama or music compared to Hispanics (33 percent). A smaller percentage of Blacks reported participating in drama or music (36 percent) compared to Whites (45 percent). A smaller percentage of Hispanics reported participating in a school-sponsored club (25 percent) compared to Whites, Blacks, or Asians (34 to 36 percent)."}, {"section_title": "Homework.", "text": "The cohort members in eighth grade spent, on average, about 5 hours a week doing homework. 3 Those attending private schools spent more time doing homework, in general, than did their peers in public schools. For example, 39 percent of private school children reported spending 11 or more hours per week on homework compared to 21 percent of public school children (table 5). Expectations for future education. Nearly three-quarters of the cohort members in eighth grade expected to complete a bachelor's degree (37 percent) or higher (36 percent) (table 6). A higher percentage from primarily English-speaking homes reported that they expected to complete a 4-year college degree or higher (74 percent) compared to those from a home where English was not the primary language (62 percent). 4 A larger percentage of children from homes where English was not the primary language than from homes where English was the primary language did not know what level of education they would complete (23 vs. 14 percent). 3 Poverty status is a function of household size and household income. Based on 2006 Census information, a household of four with a total income below $20,615 was considered to be below the federal poverty threshold. 4 Other refers to related and unrelated guardian(s). NOTE: Estimates were weighted by C7PW0. The distributions of the eighth-grade students' reading, mathematics, and science scores have standard deviations of 27.4, 21.8, and 15.9 points, respectively.

S. Department of Education to provide detailed information on the school achievement and experiences of children. Westat, Inc. assisted with the design of the study and collected the data upon which this report is based. The children participating in the ECLS-K were followed longitudinally from kindergarten through the eighth grade. These children represent all children who attended a kindergarten in the U.S. in the fall of 1998 or who attended first grade in the spring of 2000. About 87 percent of these children were in the eighth grade in 2007; 13 percent were enrolled below eighth grade because they had been retained at least once since kindergarten. About one-third of 1 percent of the children had, at some time, been promoted a grade ahead of schedule and were above eighth grade in 2007. Estimates in this report are based on data collected from about 8,800 children in the spring of 2007. Table A-1 shows the weighted percentage distributions by student, family and school characteristics for the children who were enrolled below eighth grade and those in eighth grade."}, {"section_title": "Sample Design", "text": "A nationally representative sample of 22,782 children enrolled in 944 kindergarten programs during the 1998-99 school year participated in the ECLS-K. The children attended both public and private kindergartens. The sample includes children from different racial/ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds and includes oversamples of Asian/Pacific Islanders, private kindergartens, and private kindergartners. Sampling for the ECLS-K involved a dual-frame, multistage sampling design. The first stage of sampling involved the selection of 100 primary sampling units (PSU) from a national sample of PSUs. The PSUs were counties and county groups. Public and private schools were then selected within the PSUs, and children were sampled from the selected schools. Public schools were selected from the NCES 1995-96 Common Core of Data (CCD) Universe File, which is a public school frame, and private schools were selected from a private school frame developed from the 1995-96 Private School Survey (PSS), another NCES survey. 1 Approximately 23 kindergartners were selected in each of the sampled schools. In the spring of first grade, the sample was freshened to obtain a nationally representative sample of first-graders by bringing into the study first-graders who were not enrolled in kindergarten during the 1998-99 school year and therefore did not have an opportunity for selection in the base year. The sample was not freshened in grades 3, 5, or 8. All students still enrolled in their previous year schools were recontacted, while students who had transferred from their previous year schools were subsampled in grades 1, 3, and 5. In the eighth-grade sample the ineligible children were those who moved out of the country, were deceased, or moved to another school and were not subsampled for follow-up in an earlier grade. In eighth grade, there was no subsampling of movers for follow-up as in previous rounds since the majority of children did not remain in the same school from fifth grade to eighth grade (having moved out of elementary schools into middle schools).  "}, {"section_title": "Data Collection", "text": "The eighth-grade direct child assessments were conducted from March through early June 2007, the same time of year as in prior spring data collections. About 81 percent of the assessments were completed between March and April; about 18 percent were completed in May, and less than 1 percent were completed in June. In year-round schools, multiple assessment visits to the school were made, as needed, to assess all of the sampled children in each track."}, {"section_title": "Response Rates", "text": "A total of 944 of the 1,277 originally sampled schools participated during the base year of the study. This translates into a weighted response rate (weighted by the base weight) of 74 percent for the base year of the study. The weighted child base-year survey response rate was 92 percent (i.e., 92 percent of the children were assessed at least once during kindergarten). The weighted parent base-year unit response rate was 89 percent (i.e., a parent interview was completed at least once during kindergarten). Thus, the overall base-year response rate for children was 68 percent (74 percent of schools x 92 percent of sampled children) and the base-year overall response rate for the parent interview was 66 percent (74 percent of schools x 89 percent of parents of sampled children  (Tourangeau, L\u00ea, and Nord 2005) includes an examination of the potential for nonresponse bias using three methods: (1) comparison of respondents and nonrespondents using the available sample frame, (2) multivariate analysis to identify the characteristics of cases most likely to respond, and (3) analysis of attrition bias applicable to longitudinal studies. Nonresponse bias of the estimates from the eighth grade was present but small. The item nonresponse rates for the variables used in this report are low, ranging from 0 to about 2.5 percent for the analysis sample. A few of the variables were imputed and have no missing data (e.g., mother's education "}, {"section_title": "Data Reliability", "text": "Estimates produced using data from the ECLS-K are subject to two types of error, sampling and nonsampling errors. Nonsampling errors are errors made in the collection and processing of data. Sampling errors occur because the data are collected from a sample rather than a census of the population. A detailed discussion of these types of errors can be found in America's Kindergartners (West, Denton, and Germino-Hausken 2000)."}, {"section_title": "Standard Errors and Weights", "text": "As in previous years, the ECLS-K data are weighted to compensate for unequal probabilities of selection at each sampling stage and to adjust for the effects of school, child, teacher, and parent nonresponse. A brief description of the weighting process follows. The first stage of the weighting process assigns weights to the sampled primary sampling units (PSUs) that are equal to the inverse of the PSU probability of selection. 2 The second stage of the weighting process assigns weights to the schools sampled within PSUs. The base weight for each sampled school is the PSU weight multiplied by the inverse of the probability of selecting the school. The base weights for eligible schools are adjusted for nonresponse. These adjustments are made separately for public and private schools. The base weight for each child in the sample is the school nonresponse adjusted weight for the school the child attends, multiplied by a post-stratified within-school student weight (total number of students in the school, divided by the number of students sampled in the school). The child cross-sectional weight (C7PW0), which is the weight used to produce the estimates found in this report, is the base-year child weight adjusted for nonresponse to the child assessments and parent interviews at the eighth-grade round. Only those cases with child data and parent interview data in the spring of eighth grade are included in this weighting procedure. 3 Again, these adjustments are made separately for public and private schools. This weight sums to the population of all children who attended kindergarten in the fall of 1998 or first grade in 1999-2000. In addition to properly weighting the responses, special procedures for estimating the statistical significance of the estimates were employed, because the data were collected using a complex sample design. Complex sample designs, like that used in the ECLS-K, result in data that violate the assumptions that are normally required to assess the statistical significance of results. Frequently, standard errors of estimates based on complex samples are larger than those based on simple random samples. Replication methods of variance estimation were used to reflect the multistage sample design used in the ECLS-K. Using AM statistical software, 4 the jackknife replication method (JK2) was used with 90 ECLS-K replicate weights to compute approximately unbiased estimates of the standard errors of the estimates in the report. 5"}, {"section_title": "Statistical Procedures", "text": "Comparisons made in the text were tested for statistical significance at the p < .05 level to ensure that the differences were larger than might be expected due to sampling variation. When comparing estimates between categorical groups (e.g., sex, race/ethnicity), t statistics were calculated. The formula used to compute the t statistic was: where Est 1 and Est 2 are the estimates being compared and se 1 and se 2 are their corresponding standard errors. Due to the large sample size, many differences (no matter how substantively minor) are statistically significant. No adjustments were made for multiple comparisons. In this report, a \"substantive difference\" is defined as a percentage difference of 5 points or greater, or a mean score difference of onefifth of a standard deviation or more. Differences discussed in the text of this report are both statistically significant and substantive. Regression analyses were conducted to evaluate the overall relationships between mother's education level and each of the reading and mathematics proficiency level scores. Coefficients were estimated using ordinary least squares (OLS) and statistical significance was set at .05."}, {"section_title": "Glossary: Constructs and Variables Used in Analysis", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Direct Cognitive Assessment: Reading, Mathematics, and Science", "text": "The ECLS-K eighth-grade direct cognitive assessment battery was designed to assess children's academic achievement in reading, mathematics and science in eighth grade, and to provide a means of measuring growth since kindergarten entry. The cognitive assessments used in the study (the K-1, third-, fifth-, and eighth-grade assessments) were administered using two-stage adaptive tests with multiple test forms of varying difficulties to maximize the accuracy of measurement and reduce administration time. Overlapping items for the test forms within a grade as well as across grades link the forms to a vertical scale for measuring longitudinal gains. The kindergarten-first grade (K-1), third-, and fifth-grade assessments were individually administered by trained assessors using computer assisted technology and small easel test books of the test items. The assessor first administered a routing test of a content area followed by a second stage level test as determined by the child's scores on the routing test. In the eighth grade, children completed the two-stage assessments in proctored groups, with a routing test followed by a second-stage level test. Unlike the assessments administered at the first six time points, the eighth-grade assessments were self-administered paper-pencil tests."}, {"section_title": "Reading.", "text": "The eighth-grade reading assessment included some items from the fifth-grade reading assessment and newer items which were more difficult and contributed to the formation of a proficiency level where children demonstrated a higher level of conceptual understanding of the text through deeper inferences that relied on complex vocabulary and interpretation in both the reading passage and the assessment items (Princiotta, Flanagan, and Germino Hausken 2006) Children were required to infer the opinions and/or beliefs of the author, evidence for and against theories discussed in the text, and conclusions that could be drawn from the text. In addition to providing an overall indicator of children's reading knowledge and skills over time (i.e., overall scale scores), the ECLS-K reading batteries provided information on the following specific levels of reading skills (i.e., proficiency scores): (1) identifying upper-and lower-case letters of the alphabet by name (letter knowledge); (2) associating letters with sounds at the beginning of words (beginning sounds); (3) associating letters with sounds at the end of words (ending sounds); (4) recognizing common \"sight\" words (sight words); (5) reading words in context (words in context); (6) making inferences using cues that were directly stated with key words in text (literal inference); (7) identifying clues used to make inferences (extrapolation); (8) demonstrating understanding of author's craft and making connections between a problem in the narrative and similar life problems (evaluation); (9) comprehension of biographical and expository text (evaluating nonfiction); and (10) evaluating complex syntax and understanding high-level nuanced vocabulary in biographical text (evaluating complex syntax). This report presents information on children's overall reading knowledge and skills at eighth grade. Additionally, this report presents information on specific levels of reading skills associated with eighth grade (proficiency levels 6 through 10). Proficiency levels 1 through 5 were achieved by nearly all (98 percent or more) children by the eighth grade and thus are not addressed in this report. Mathematics. The eighth-grade mathematics assessments included increasingly difficult items which addressed the following content strands: number sense, properties, and operations; measurement; geometry and spatial sense; data analysis, statistics, and probability; and patterns, algebra, and functions. The cognitive processes (conceptual, procedural, and problem solving) were assessed in each of the strands. Some of the items drew upon knowledge from more than one strand. For example, an item might require that a child apply knowledge about geometry, measurement, and number operations to answer the question correctly. In addition to providing an overall indicator of children's mathematics knowledge and skills over time (i.e., overall scale scores), the ECLS-K mathematics battery provides information on the following specific levels of mathematics skills (i.e., proficiency scores): (1) identifying some one-digit numerals, recognizing geometric shapes, and one-to-one counting up to 10 objects (number and shape); (2) reading all one-digit numerals, counting beyond 10, recognizing a sequence of patterns, and using nonstandard units of length to compare the size of objects (relative size); (3) reading two-digit numerals, recognizing the next number in a sequence, identifying the ordinal position of an object, and solving a simple word problem (ordinality and sequence); (4) solving simple addition and subtraction problems (addition and subtraction); (5) solving simple multiplication and division problems and recognizing more complex number patterns (multiplication and division); (6) demonstrating understanding of place value in integers to the hundreds place (place value); (7) using knowledge of measurement and rate to solve word problems (rate and measurement); (8) solving problems using fractions (fractions); and (9) solving word problems involving area and volume (area and volume). This report presents information on children's overall mathematics knowledge and skills at eighth grade. Additionally, this report presents information on specific levels of mathematics skills associated with eighth grade (proficiency levels 6 through 9). Proficiency levels 1 through 5 were mastered by nearly all (98 percent or more) of the children at eighth grade and are not presented in this report. Science. In the eighth-grade assessment, equal emphasis was placed on life science, earth and space science, and physical science. Children needed to demonstrate understanding of the physical and natural world, draw inferences, and comprehend relationships. In addition, they had to interpret scientific data, formulate hypotheses, and identify the best plan to investigate a given question. No set of proficiency levels was developed. The subject matter content of the science assessment domain was too diverse and the items insufficiently ranked or graded to permit the formation of a set of proficiency levels. Instead, a single score was calculated to represent each child's breadth and depth of understanding and knowledge of science."}, {"section_title": "Student's School Experiences and Expectations", "text": "In the eighth grade data collection, children completed a student questionnaire after completing the routing test.
