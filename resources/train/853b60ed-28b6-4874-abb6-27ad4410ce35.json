[{"section_title": "", "text": "One of the most important findings of the research was the public health officials own ideas about the greatest obstacle to preventing the spread of WNV in their jurisdictions. General consensus is that more resources be made available to properly combat this pathogen. More staff and funds to pay workers and provide support for every aspect of surveillance, prevention and control are deemed necessary. Specifically, there is a great need for personnel with specialized training. The support and encouragement of public health organizations is needed to attract individuals into academic fields that will prepare them for infectious disease epidemiology which is crucial to the field. Local level response may have been dictated by resource availability as opposed to the perceived threat. Surprisingly, length of time in the current position was more closely related to lower infection rates than length of surveillance. This suggests that more experienced public health workers likely have some knowledge or experience which was not made known through the survey. Policy implications suggest increased education for public health officials, especially encouragement of more experienced workers to share their knowledge and experiences with less experienced workers.

During 2002, Health", "text": "Canada reported 340 confirmed human cases of WNV from 3 provinces; 20 cases resulted in death (Health Canada 2003). A year later, 466 confirmed human cases were reported from 9 provinces, 10 cases resulted in death (Health Canada 2004a, Health Canada 2004b. Twenty-five cases were reported from five provinces during (Health Canada 2005. The following year the number of cases jumped substantially as five provinces reported a total of 127 cases with 2 cases resulting in deaths (Health Canada 2006). In Mexico, WNV activity was reported in humans, horses and mosquitoes (Blitvich et al. 2003, Mendez-Galvan 2004, Elizondo-Quiroga et al. 2005. Documentation was obtained reporting 6 positive human cases in northern Mexico in 2003(PAHO 2003 and one positive human case in 2004 (Elizondo-Quiroga et al. 2005). One possible theory regarding the lack of documented cases of WNV in Mexico is the idea that the human population there is exposed to other flaviviruses of the same genus. This may result in developing antibodies which may provide some protection against WNV infection (Oglesby 2005). In North America (excluding Mexico), WNV has resulted in a greater number of reported cases than previous outbreaks (Hayes 2001). There may be variables outside the scope of this dissertation which could account for the low reported numbers in Mexico. The increased occurrence in humans accounts for the number of cases reported in the U.S. Only four states reported WNV activity (birds, mosquitoes, and other animals in addition to human cases) in 1999 (CDC 2007). From 1999From through 2003, the number of counties and states reporting WNV activity increased yearly. By the end of 2003, 2,289 counties in 46 states and DC reported WNV activity (CDC 2007). During 2004 1,499 counties in 47 states and DC reported WNV activity (CDC 2007). Monitoring virus occurrence in birds and mosquitoes is useful in identifying areas where transmission cycles could occur (CDC 2003). The WNV transmission cycle exists mainly between birds and mosquitoes. Infected mosquitoes are responsible for transmitting the virus when obtaining a blood meal (CDC 2005). Viral amplification occurs in infected birds, while horses and humans are considered incidental hosts and do not create sufficient amounts of the virus to infect mosquitoes. Although human infections have been reported between late March and early December, occurrence in mosquitoes and birds has been reported earlier in the year (CDC 2007). Several explanations have provided for the early onset of WNV activity in mosquitoes. Such early occurrence has been associated with overwintering mosquitoes which hibernate during the winter and contribute to the maintenance of WNV during the winter season (Nasci et al. 2001). Additionally in states with warm temperatures year round, such as the Gulf States the virus may circulate year-round with cases reported in all 12 months (CDC 2003). Research on WNV has focused mainly on hosts, vectors (mosquitoes) and their interaction with the environment. More research is needed on the significance of risk factors in the spread of WNV (CDC 2003). Further, explanations regarding the spatial distribution of risk factors for human infection are not readily available. Yet identifying risk factors is significant in mitigating the spread of WNV. Although it is difficult to prevent the spread of the pathogen, one can reduce the risk of being infected by controlling the number of vectors. Vectors can be better controlled once risk factors are identified. Thus far, age (Hochberg et al. 2002, Solomon et al. 2004, flooded basements (Han et al. 1999, Hubalek 2000, proximity to migratory routes of infected birds (Hubalek 2000, Rappole et al. 2000 and weather conditions (Hubalek et al. 2000, Shaman et al. 2002 have been identified as possible risk factors. The role of socioeconomic status has not previously been identified as a significant risk factor in the incidence and spread of WNV. Thus, this research examines the significance of selected socio-demographic characteristics as risk factors in explaining the spatial incidence and distribution of WNV. This research has the ultimate goal of reducing the number of human cases of WNV by identifying socio-demographic characteristics which may be considered risk factors for infection. Identification of risk factors and those areas at greatest risk of an outbreak can provide the basis for application of arbovirus prevention and control measures.

The hypotheses which provide the basis for the research are: variation of risk factors by location, specific risk factors can be identified that relate to cases of WNV, socio-demographic characteristics can be used to produce a classification of counties, public health officials respond to WNV based on their perception of the threat posed by WNV and the socio-demographic characteristics of the survey respondents influences their perception of the risk presented by WNV."}, {"section_title": "Organization of Dissertation", "text": "To help understand the diffusion of WNV Chapter 2 provides an overview of the spread of WNV along with a summary of the current knowledge of West Nile Virus and associated risk factors.

Chapter 3 presents a discussion of the data produced, the study methodology and the use of statistical analysis to answer the research questions. Within this chapter is a discussion of the study area selection. This research takes an innovative approach to the study of WNV by attempting to link socio-demographic characteristics to the prevalence of WNV related disease. As a recently emergent disease, it is important to learn as much as possible about WNV in order to prevent future deadly outbreaks. Understanding the spread of WNV will be accomplished by the use of discriminant analysis, factor analysis and regression analysis to analyze socio-demographic characteristics as risk factors for neurological disease. These statistical analyses were performed to organize the data at the county-level and gain a better understanding of the diffusion of WNV. Chapter 4 contains historical and contemporary geographic perspectives on WNV and describes the diffusion of WNV throughout the U.S. Information regarding positive infection in birds, horses, humans and mosquitoes, is included. Geographic theory and theories on disease diffusion from the literature will be applied to provide explanations for the observed patterns of diffusion associated with WNV in the United States. Knowledge of previous and current patterns of the diffusion of WNV may be useful in determining future patterns allowing public health officials to minimize future impacts of the disease. Chapter 5 is a discussion of a survey mailed to all 88 county-level public health officials in the state of Ohio and the survey results. It includes a discussion of public health officials and their views on WNV as expressed by their responses to the survey. Furthermore, trends between perspectives on WNV and the number of reported cases of human disease will be discussed. Understanding how public health officials perceive the threat of the disease may be related to how aggressively they respond to the virus. Chapter 6 contains a summary and interpretation of the findings. Conclusions and policy perspectives will be discussed in this chapter.

The discipline has a rich history as a basis for this research. Hippocrates was the first scientist to associate environmental factors with health in his 400 BCE treatise, On Airs, Waters, and Places where he suggested a link between the humors (internal body fluids) and external forces influencing humoral balance (Valencius 2000). Thomas Sydenham's 17 th century medical investigations continued the Greek tradition of studying the relationship between humans and their environment (Valencius 2000). During a period of intense settlement by Europeans and North Americans, medical geography provided a basis for understanding places and people (Harrison 2000). Allegiance to Hippocratic thought was part of the character of early American medicine. Early 19 th century physicians and researchers produced topographies that described illnesses that befell new settlers in the hinterlands of North America (Harrison 2000). After WWII geographers focused more attention on perfecting techniques in mapping disease and health problems, using cartography to display the distribution of factors related to health (Pyle 1979). Physicians were the early contributors to the field of medical geography; post WWII, geographers contributed spatial analysis to disease ecology and health care delivery (Valencius 2000). Geography's influence is increasingly evident as disease ecology has become more reliant on elaborate techniques of measurement, quantification and visualization, especially through the use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS). These new techniques and technologies allow for timely analysis of spatial data. During the latter half of the twentieth century the evolution of medical Geography in the United States was influenced by British, French and German Scholars (Pyle 1983). Jacques May, a French medical geographer, is considered the \"father\" of American medical geography. In 1950, at the request of the American Geographical society, May developed an atlas of disease (Meade and Earickson 2000). May's 1951 article published in the Geographical Review set the agenda for the field suggesting the study of relationships between health and environments (Valencius 2000). Current work in the area of disease ecology evolved from May's early influence as patterns of disease distribution are important to the study of disease ecology. Increasingly, scientific knowledge and methods from other disciplines have been adopted in addition to further progress geography (Pyle 1983;Meade and Earickson 2000). As a result, scholars have come to see humans as affecting and being affected by their environment both personally and collectively in health-related ways Earickson 2000, McGlashan andBlunden 1983). New ideas, techniques and technology helped to advance the discipline of medical geography. The argument for more emphasis on understanding culture and behavior relative to persistent disease came from Armstrong (Pyle 1983). In 1963 Howe's national atlas of disease mortality was innovative for its use of statistical data and demographics to produce maps of mortality for numerous causes of death in Britain (Howe and Phillips 1983). Also in the 1960s, Murray applied Howe's techniques to mortality rates in the United States (Pyle 1983 (Pyle 1983). By the 1980s medical geographers perfected their disease mapping skills and introduced new techniques after the introduction of microcomputers (Pyle 1983). Geographic Information Systems (GIS) continues to be one of the most innovative technologies available to scholars. This technology combines the use of computers, database, analysis and mapping."}, {"section_title": "Disease Diffusion", "text": "Migration is the most usual explanation of how disease agents or other phenomenon come to be found in a particular location (Meade and Earickson 2000). Understanding the mechanisms that influence the spread of a phenomenon and its spatial pattern are crucial to the geographic study of diffusion (Meade and Earickson 2000). Diffusion is defined as the spread of a phenomenon from one place to another (Haggett 2000, Meade andEarickson 2000). Early work by Torsten Hagerstrand remains the basis of current studies in diffusion (Pyle 1979, Haggett 2000. Hagerstrand described a four-stage model for the passage of diffusion waves, by which an idea or phenomena such as disease spreads from one area to another (Pyle 1979, Haggett 2000. Many researchers suggest that this model of expansion diffusion explains the spread of a disease such as WNV, where it moves to a new place while still remaining in the original location (Haggett 2000, Pyle 1979, Meade and Earickson 2000. Adaptations to Hagerstrand's ideas on innovation waves have allowed scholars to further knowledge of how diseases spread (Pyle 1979, Haggett 2000. Ideas on barriers and urban hierarchy coupled with increasing computing power have led to the use of better geographic models in the study of disease diffusion (Haggett 2000). One of the early epidemic diseases to be modeled was measles. Measles has been used for epidemic modeling, due to the simplicity of its transmission, as it is spread through direct contact (Haggett 2000). A distinctive wavelike behavior is associated with the diffusion of measles with cycles that vary based on the size of the population under study (Bjornstad et al. 2002). Measles was also ideal for study because it is easily recognized and misdiagnosis is rare (Haggett 2000). As a highly contagious disease agent, measles is associated with high attack rates and epidemic events that are easily identified (Haggett 2000). Measles is globally distributed with spatial variation in temporal patterns. To prevent further deaths, results of measles studies were aimed at aiding the eradication of the disease worldwide (Haggett 2000). The Hamer-Soper model is a simple mass-action model that has been used to describe the wave-generating mechanism associated with measles (Haggett 2000). People with no immunity are \"susceptibles\" those with the disease are \"infectives.\" In contrast, \"recovereds\" are individuals who have gained immunity as a result of surviving the disease (Haggett 2000, Cliff et al. 1986. As susceptibles and infectives interact, the number of infectives increases and the number of infectives is reduced by recovery or death (Haggett 2000). While this model is useful for predicting the timing of recurrences, it is less accurate in predicting the size of outbreaks (Haggett 2000).  (Pyle 1979). Mapping the spatial distribution of disease cases can provide clues to the environmental factors which influence disease diffusion. Mapping the distribution of disease cases has been useful in forecasting disease incidence when combined with epidemic modeling. The expanding spatial range of West Nile Virus provides an opportunity to study the factors related to the change in patterns associated with the disease. The model used for this research, is similar to other models insofar as it will be used to determine areas at risk. What makes the model unique is the use of socio-demographic characteristics as risk factors. Geographic theory on disease diffusion and spatial analysis of disease patterns is important to this research as they provide the foundation for study. Medical geography has three distinct areas of focus: location, ecological relationships, and the unique character of particular places (Haggett 2000). I begin by first identifying the location of cases of neurological disease from WNV, followed by examining the socio-demographic characteristics of counties with and without cases of neurological disease from WNV. Knowledge of similar diseases may be relevant to furthering the study of WNV. Similar diseases that spread in the same manner and by the same agent may provide clues on how to stop the spread. I then look for unique characteristics of the locations where WNV appears. I report the findings and discuss the socio-demographic characteristics or combination of characteristics the data suggests promotes the spread of WNV within the study area. West Nile Virus WNV is an arbovirus, \"an infectious agent transmitted by an arthropod vector, in which they have the ability to multiply\" (Fiennes 1978). WNV is maintained in cycles involving birds and mosquitoes (McLean et al. 2001, Jupp 2001. Mosquitoes that feed on both birds and humans maintain the cycle of transmission when obtaining a bloodmeal. Birds are considered the natural hosts of WNV but antibodies have also been found in other vertebrate species, including: horses, sheep, cattle, pigs, dogs, cats, bats, a chipmunk, a skunk and a domestic rabbit (Fiennes 1978). The virus can live and multiply in mosquitoes and can pass to the next generation by transovarian infection (Jordan et al. 2000)."}, {"section_title": "Epidemiology", "text": "WNV was first isolated from a febrile patient in Uganda in 1937 during a study of immunity to yellow fever (Smithburn et al. 1940). Until it first appeared in the Western Hemisphere in 1999, WNV had been found mainly in Africa, the Middle East, the former Soviet Union, India and parts of Europe (Monath and Heinz 1996). Human infections were common in the Nile Delta during the 1950s, an epidemic of mild cases occurred in South Africa in 1974 during which 55% of the population of central and Northern Cape Province were infected (Monath and Heinz 1996). In Asia, infections are common and infection occurs at a very high rate in many areas (Monath and Heinz 1996). From 1996-1999, WNV caused large epidemics in Southern Romania (1996), in the Volgograd region of Russia (1999), and in the northeastern United States (1999) (Hayes 2001). These epidemics occurred in densely populated urban areas as well as nearby suburban/rural areas and were the first reported in large cities (Hayes 2001). The virus continues to be a public health concern in the United States (CDC 2009). When the virus first appears in a new area where the disease is uncommon, diagnosis can be complicated by the fact that many of the symptoms are similar to other illnesses such as flu, or another arbovirus (Monath and Heinz 1996;CDC 2003)."}, {"section_title": "Illness Associated with WNV", "text": "Human infection by the virus does not always result in symptoms or illness; most infected people have no clinical symptoms. When symptoms do occur they can range from mild flu-like symptoms to more serious forms of illness (Monath and Heinz 1996). Fever, headache, backache, loss of appetite and generalized muscle pain are the most common symptoms of a mild case (West Nile fever) and may be accompanied by a rash. The illness usually lasts 3 to 6 days, followed by rapid recovery (Monath and Heinz 1996). Diagnosis is made by blood tests that reveal presence of the virus (Monath and Heinz 1996). There are three categories of severe neurologic illness associated with WNV: meningitis, encephalitis and meningoencephalitis (Sejvar 2003). First, meningitis (swelling of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord) due to WNV is accompanied by fever, can occasionally be isolated from cerebrospinal fluid. Second, encephalitis (inflammation of brain tissue) due to WNV is accompanied by altered mental status (Sejvar 2003). Meningoencephalitis refers to inflammation of both the brain and the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. These more severe neurological forms most commonly occur in elderly patients and may result in longterm illness and even death (Sejvar 2003). Occasionally, acute flaccid paralysis and a polio-like illness have also been identified (Sejvar 2003). Supportive care is provided for the symptoms of WNV infection, as there is no cure or specific treatment for WNV (Monath and Heinz 1996). Recent outbreaks in Europe and the United States have resulted in more human cases of severe neurological disease and more deaths than all previously known outbreaks of WNV (Hayes 2001). This increased virulence is a major cause of concern for public health officials."}, {"section_title": "Modes of Transmission", "text": "Mosquito bites are the most common mode of transmission of the virus to human populations (Chamberlain andSudia 1961, Roehrig andPeterson 2004). Mosquitoes become infected after feeding on a viremic bird and transmit the virus in their saliva when obtaining a blood meal. Whereas WNV is a disease of birds with mammals as terminal hosts, amplification at levels significant to infect mosquitoes does not occur (Dodd and Leiby 2004). Other modes of transmission such as transplacental infection have been identified (CDC 2002a) (CDC 2002e), but transmission by mosquitoes remains the most significant cause of the disease (Roehrig and Peterson 2004). Two cases of laboratory acquired infection have been reported (CDC 2002b, CDC 2002a. Both cases occurred while working with infected specimens (CDC 2002b, CDC 2002a. At least one case of infection in a newborn has been associated with transplacental infection. Cerebral abnormalities in the infant lead to testing blood samples which tested positive for the virus (CDC 2002e). A possible link to breastfeeding was also documented in at least one case in Michigan in 2002 (CDC 2002b). The virus has also been transmitted by transplantation of organs from an infected donor. Four cases of WNV infection have been attributed to organ donation. Four organs transplanted from a single organ donor resulted in WNV infection in the organ recipients (CDC 2002c, Iwamoto et al. 2003. The source of infection in the organ donor was traced to blood transfusions (Iwamoto et al. 2003). To reduce the risk of infection by transfusion, blood collection agencies implemented new testing procedures in 2003 by screening all donations for WNV (CDC 2004). Testing of 6 million units from June-December of that year resulted in the removal of 818 units from the blood supply (CDC 2004). As a result of enhanced testing of donated blood only 6 cases of confirmed or probable cases of transfusionassociated transmission of WNV were reported during 2003 (CDC 2004)."}, {"section_title": "St. Louis Encephalitis", "text": "Another flavivirus found in the United States is St. Louis Encephalitis (SLE). SLE is also an arbovirus spread by mosquitoes and was first identified as a threat to humans in 1933 after an outbreak in St. Louis, Missouri (Chamberlain 1980). Retrospective studies of similar outbreaks in other locations and serologic testing of residents identified the prevalence of SLE in Paris, Illinois and Toledo, Ohio (Chamberlain 1980). Serologic testing of humans and domestic animals (horses and fowl) along with studies of the environment provided clues that mosquitoes are the likely vector for transmission of the virus (Chamberlain 1980). From 1955From to 1976 SLE was responsible for approximately 71% of vector-borne encephalitis cases in the U. S. (Monath 1980b). Living in a low-income household has been identified as one of the social characteristics that increase the risk of contracting SLE and dengue (Monath 1980a, Reiter et al. 2003. SLE, dengue and WNV are all flaviviruses and may have similar risk factors."}, {"section_title": "Risk Factors", "text": "It has been suggested that the study of risk factors identifies circumstances favorable for development of an epidemic and possibly to identify circumstances where an epidemic will not develop (Monath 1980, Reeves 1980. Place of risk begins at home where people spend most of their time, so it is appropriate to explore risk factors associated with the home environment. Buildings in low income neighborhoods may suffer from inadequate maintenance which can result in problems that increase the opportunity to come into contact with competent vectors in and around the home (Han et al. 1999, Meade andEarickson 2000). Meade and Earickson (2000) suggest that \"Many diseases seem to occur consistently more often among the poor than among the affluent.\" For example, environmental factors such as water quality, sanitation, overcrowding, poor housing and rubbish accumulation contribute to the disproportionate occurrence of disease among the poor (Harpham et al. 1988). Areas of both low and high SES have been associated with a higher number of cases of SLE due to different factors. Impoverished areas experienced higher numbers of cases of SLE during several outbreaks (Monath 1980). Environmental factors determined the level of SLE transmission in localized geographic areas of affected cities. Exposure to the vector was higher in an area of substandard housing in Greenville, Mississippi in 1975 compared to the non-blighted areas of the same city (Monath 1980b). In addition, incidence of SLE in West Central Memphis, (an area of lower-than-average socioeconomic status (SES)) was significantly higher than the rest of Memphis-Shelby County in 1975. Nonetheless, increased vector production has been associated with inadequate outdoor sanitation in impoverished areas during many outbreaks of SLE (Monath 1980b (Monath 1980b). Individuals in more affluent areas are more likely to be involved in outdoor activities which increase the risk of contact with the mosquito vector. In sum, past research has identified a clear association between the environmental conditions in which people live and risk of infection by SLE. In light of these studies, further study of risk factors is needed to determine if the same is true for WNV."}, {"section_title": "Age", "text": "In the 1950s, Taylor et al. (1956) conducted an intensive study aimed at determining the distribution of WNV antibodies in the human population of Egypt. Specimens were collected from a selective sample of the Egyptian population to describe the geographic extent of antibodies to WNV. Results of the study led the authors to conclude that WNV was a childhood disease with yearly peaks of transmission during mid-summer (Taylor et al. 1956). Adults in the same population were most likely infected as children and had developed immunity to WNV. In contrast to the Egyptian study, studies in the U. S. have identified older age as a risk factor for severe neurological illness and death from WNV infection in the U. S. (Hochberg et al. 2002. During the outbreak in New York City in 1999, Nash et al. (2001) used active surveillance to identify human cases. This was followed by laboratory testing of serum and cerebrospinal fluids (when available) from hospitalized patients to isolate virus antibodies from serum and cerebrospinal fluids (Taylor et al. 1956). Results of the study identified the median age of patients hospitalized for WNV illness as 71 years; with persons age 50 or older as 20 times more likely to become ill (Taylor et al. 1956). They also identified an age of 75 or older as a risk factor for death from WNV infection (Taylor et al. 1956 (CDC 2002d). There is great concern in reducing the risk of infection for all individuals. There is a particular interest in reducing the risk of infection in the elderly who are more likely to suffer from more serious complications (Behney et al.). Recent data from the literature reinforces the idea that WNV, once considered a childhood disease is now considered a disease of greatest concern to the elderly.

Using this guideline the poverty level was set at three times \"what the USDA called the lowest-cost 'nutritionally adequate' diet\" (Besharov 1995 (Harpham et al. 1998). Researchers have found an association between poverty and vector-borne diseases. Socioeconomic status (SES) was identified as a risk factor for Dengue Fever during a study of two neighboring towns, Laredo, Texas and Neuvo Laredo, Taumalipas, Mexico (Reiter et al. 2003). Seropositive test results were fewer in the more affluent Laredo. In contrast, a greater proportion of seropositive test results were obtained in the less affluent Nuevo Laredo (Reiter et al. 2003).

Analysis of dead bird locations, \"enabled preemptive measures to reduce mosquito breeding\" (Mostashari et al. 2003). These control measures were used earlier than with laboratory confirmation of WNV activity in vertebrate hosts and arthropod vectors. However, one limitation of using dead birds as an indicator is that someone has to report them (Eidson et al. 2001, Mostashari et al. 2003. As crows and jays (the most likely species to be found dead from the virus) adapt to the pathogen they will develop immunity making them less likely to succumb to the disease (Eidson et al. 2001, Mostashari et al. 2003.

For example, flooding of the Moravia River in 1997 caused massive broods of mosquitoes to hatch in association with an outbreak of WNV in the Czech Republic (Hubalek et al. 2000). Warm dry weather after flood conditions was associated with the formation of suitable breeding habitats for mosquitoes in Bucharest (Hubalek 2000). Further, it was found that drought conditions result in a concentration of birds and mosquito vectors near limited water resources in a small area (Shaman et al. 2002, Brinton 2002. Dispersal of avian hosts and mosquito vectors occur when the drought ends, initiating the early transmission phase of the viral cycle (Shaman et al. 2002). The lack of heavy rain to flush sewer systems results in increased mosquito populations in cities (Brinton 2002). Higher temperatures decrease larval development time, leading to the production of a greater number of mosquito vectors in a shorter time period (Alto and Juliano 2001). Research on SLE found that higher temperatures and lack of rain during the summer months resulted in sufficient habitat for Culex pipiens to breed (Monath 1980b).

These independent variables are shown in Table 3.1. Previous research on health and environment suggests that socioeconomic status is positively related to the health of individuals and helps to determine where an individual lives (Yen and Syme 1999). In this research socio-demographic variables were used as a surrogate to represent conditions of the social environment within each county. Total population and population density have been associated with a higher prevalence of arbovirus cases (Pyle and Cook 1978). In addition, the literature suggests that old age is a risk factor for severe neurological illness and death from WNV infection in the United States (Hochberg et al. 2002). The median age of patients hospitalized as 71 years and persons age 50 or older as 20 times more likely to become ill (CDC 2002a, CDC 2002d).

For this research, each county was also designated as urban or rural based on the Rural-Urban continuum. As reported by the USDA: Rural-urban Continuum Codes form a classification scheme that distinguishes metropolitan counties by size and nonmetropolitan counties by degree of urbanization and proximity to metro areas (USDA 2007). As designated by the USDA each county is identified by a code from 1 through 9 related to population and proximity to metropolitan areas (Table 3.2). For this study counties were designated as urban when they had an urban continuum code of 1, 2, or 3.

Hypothesis 2: Specific risk factors can be identified that relate to cases of WNV neurological disease. The goal is to identify a classification of counties. The assumption is that counties with particular socio-demographic characteristics are associated with high or low numbers of reported cases of human WNV neurological disease. Hypothesis 3: Socio-demographic characteristics can be used to produce a classification of counties. The third research goal is to describe county types based on selected sociodemographic characteristics to explain the geographic distribution of human cases of WNV resulting in neurological disease. The assumption is that study results will be used to identify areas where prevention and control methods should be employed. Factor analysis is used to simplify the data and identify underlying factors (Kachigan 1991) associated with the spread of WNV. The principal components factor analysis eliminates redundancies of interdependent variables (Wong 1968). Factor analysis was used on the 21 variables listed in Table 3.1 to produce a classification of counties. This classification is used to determine whether the population of a particular type of county is at a greater risk of infection by WNV. The analysis reduced the number of variables by grouping together those variables which are more closely correlated to at the county level. Once these factors were derived an appropriate description of the structural factors were given. Equally important, were the factor scores. Z scores (mean of 0) for each county in the analysis resulted for each of the derived factors (Kachigan 1991, Warner 2008. While this technique provides an understanding of the effect of selected variables as risk factors for WNV disease, it does not explain variation by county. Because each factor score represents a standardized factor for each county, it was regressed on the WNV infection rate to further elucidate these variables as risk factors. Mapping the residuals provides a visual representation of the spatial phenomena using a less complex descriptive statistical base that allows for easier interpretation of results (Robinson et al. 1968). The factor analysis identifies statistically significant independent variables and rejects those that are not statistically significant (Thomas 1968, Warner 2008. To further improve our understanding of the geographic distribution of human cases of WNV, stepwise discriminant analysis was used to provide a near-optimal grouping of human case observations into 3 distinct classes (Berry 1968). This technique focused on the 21 socio-demographic characteristics found in literature directly or indirectly related to human cases of WNV. This approach required a priori classification of WNV according to infection rate by county. In essence, counties with an infection rate greater than 0, were classified according to WNV infection rate as: high, moderate and low number of cases. See Tables 3.3 and 3.4.  The factor ratio matrix determines significance of discriminant variables as significant or insignificant. The analysis also provides a classification matrix, a numerical classification of counties in that group (Kachigan 1991). Counties are classed correct or incorrect based upon the discriminant power of variables. At any particular stage of analysis, an understanding of each county among a priori groups can be made and determine the number of counties classed correctly and incorrectly. This stepwise discriminant analysis makes it possible to determine individual variables that discriminate among a priori groups and identified the number or the combination of variables that were significant discriminators. Level two of the analysis is represented by Figures 3.1 and 3.2. These analyses, factor analytical for which factor scores are regressed on the dependent variable (human WNV infection rate) and stepwise discriminant analysis together, will improve the understanding of the geographic distribution of human cases of WNV in the study area.  The research goal was to relate the response of public health officials to the WNV infection rate within their respective jurisdictions. We assume that public health officials have implemented programs in response to the occurrence of neurological disease. Hypothesis 5: Socio-demographic characteristics of the survey respondents influenced their perception of the risk presented by WNV. The assumption is that public health officials with more experience will be more likely to perceive WNV as a greater threat. It is likely that counties with a high infection rate will be associated with a high level of awareness of the disease and the highest level of response. Examining the diffusion of WNV alone does not provide the total picture, the response by public health officials needs to be examined. To that end, a sample of counties was surveyed. Survey responses help to provide a basis for understanding the relationship between the WNV infection rate in humans and the response by local level public health officials. Data obtained from the survey responses allows the opportunity to determine how local level public health officials in the state of Ohio were able to reduce the risk of infection by their response. The survey is a cost effective measurement tool with the potential to generate substantial data for analysis. The survey design is modeled after a survey previously administered by the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE). Their intent was to assess the capacity of state and large city health departments to conduct surveillance, prevention and control activities for WNV infection (CSTE 2005). With approval from the organization, many of their questions were adopted for use in my survey. This was done so that comparison could be made between their state-level responses and my county-level responses. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) is used to identify and measure the source of variation within a dataset (Kachigan 1991). This test analyzes the differences in the mean values associated with a particular variable (Kachigan 1991). ANOVA results will identify differences in responses among the socio-demographic responses of the survey respondents. The use of these statistical analyses will improve the understanding of the diffusion of WNV within the study area and the response to WNV by county-level public health officials in Ohio.  (Brownstein et al. 2004). The means of entry into the United States is unknown, but, surveillance data has made it possible to track the spread of WNV through the study area. This chapter provides an explanation of the surveillance data to define the observed pattern of human cases. Socio-demographic characteristics that both facilitate the spread and act as barriers are determined, and offered here. The primary question posed by this research was \"Can socio-demographic characteristics be considered risk factors for neurological disease due to West Nile Virus?\" In support of this goal it is necessary to identify socio-demographic characteristics associated with human cases of WNV infection. It is also important to determine a type of county more frequently associated with cases of WNV. Finally, the response of public health officials at the county level is related to their perception of the threat posed by WNV in their jurisdictions. Five hypotheses are addressed in order to answer the research questions. These are: 1) Risk factors will vary by location; 2) specific risk factors can be identified that relate to cases of WNV neurological disease; 3) socio-demographic characteristics can be used to produce a classification of counties; 4) public health officials are responding to the threat of WNV in accordance with their perception of the disease as a local threat and; 5) socio-demographic characteristics of the survey respondents influenced their perception of the risk presented by WNV."}, {"section_title": "Diffusion of WNV", "text": "In 1999 WNV there were 62 documented human cases of WNV which  human cases were reported from western counties in the study area.

The pattern of spread represented by the dots appears consistent with major transportation routes throughout the study area. The absence of reported human cases in counties with a large number of reported bird infections is likely related to less dense human populations in those areas; northern Vermont, northwestern New York. The most significant wave of viral activity appears in 2002, when viral activity is more widespread, with clusters near large urban centers, especially in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Illinois and Ohio. Greater awareness and increased reporting of human cases are the most likely reasons for increased reporting of human case data. WNV activity in animals spread over time at about the same pace as activity in birds and mosquitoes, with the most significant spread occurring in 2002. The same is observed in the human population. Clustering of WNV activity in animals is very similar to the pattern for birds and mosquitoes during the same time period. Fewer positive sentinels were reported than humans and other animals. It is possible that not all areas had surveillance measures in place to detect viral activity in sentinels.  Due to the limitations of the analysis only those counties with an infection rate greater than 0 were included in these results.

Equine surveillance was reported by 31% of respondents. Avian surveillance is in place in 81% of participating counties, and 71% of respondents indicated that mosquito surveillance has been implemented for WNV. Mosquito control and radio or TV PSA's have been begun in 40% of responding counties. Prevention messages have also been widely used (See Table 5.2). The most commonly promoted messages are those suggesting the use of DEET based products (83%), peri-residential source reduction (67%) and personal prevention methods (88%).

Based on the survey results there does seem to be some collaboration between jurisdictions. For the areas of surveillance, prevention and control 38% of respondents indicated they collaborate with a particular city or county. To examine the response of public health officials it was necessary to divide counties into to groups: those counties with an infection rate greater than zero and those counties with an infection rate equal to zero. Twenty-four counties had an infection rate greater than zero, with an average of 2.8 WNV activities implemented and 2.5 WNV prevention messages per county. Three counties with an infection rate greater than zero did not implement WNV activities and three did not promote WNV prevention methods. Thirty-three counties had an infection rate equal to zero, with an average of 3.5 WNV activities implemented and 2.8 WNV prevention messages per county. Two counties with an infection rate greater than zero did not implement WNV activities and three did not promote WNV prevention methods. These results were also compared to the demographic responses of the respondents. For counties where the respondent was employed for more than fifteen years in the present job the infection rates ranged from 0.04 -0.35. The highest infection rates were associated with counties where respondents were in the current position for fifteen years or less. With respect to length of employment in the present position there is a cluster of counties where the respondent has more than twenty years in the northern part of the state, with a few counties in the western part of the state. Counties where the respondent was employed between fifteen and twenty years were mainly concentrated in the western part of the state. Those employed between ten and fifteen years are mainly in the western part of the state. In the southern part of the state is the highest concentration of those employed between five and ten years in the current position, While those employed for 5 years or less are located throughout the entire state. ANOVA was used to determine the relationship between experience of survey respondents and infection rates. Comparing infection rates to the demographics of survey respondents with ANOVA yielded the following F values: Years in current position 2.28, gender 0.03, education 0.24, and age 0.55. Of these results, only years in current position yielded an F value greater than 1. This suggests a significant relationship between years in current position and the WNV infection rate. For demographics with F values less than 1, there are no significant relationships between these variables and county-level infection rates. were related to the use of DEET-based products and personal protective measures.

The 24 counties with infection rates greater than zero implemented an average of 2.8 WNV activities and 2.5 prevention messages per county. An average of 3.5 WNV activities and 2.8 prevention messages were implemented in counties with infection rates equal to zero. Infection rates were lowest in counties where respondents were employed for more than fifteen years. Analysis did not identify a significant relationship between county-level infection rates and type of surveillance, or between the length of avian or mosquito surveillance. However, some correlation between human surveillance and countylevel infection rates has been identified. Can socio-demographic characteristics be identified and related to human cases of WNV infection? Earlier research suggests that a relationship exists between several demographic variables and the spread of WNV (Han et al. 1999, Ruiz et al. 2004, Ruiz et al. 2007. This research confirmed earlier findings with respect to the United States. In particular, I found the following socio-demographic characteristics to be positively linked to higher WNV infection rates: educational attainment, age of the population, poverty levels, and age of housing. Socio-economic variables were useful in discriminating between high moderate and low infection rates and showed modest capabilities of estimating actual rates. Is there a particular type of county that is more frequently associated with cases of WNV? Earlier research identified a positive relationship between impoverished areas and higher disease rates during studies of dengue fever along the United States/Mexico border (Reiter et al. 2003) and St. Louis Encephalitis in the United States (Chamberlain 1980). Similarly research on WNV in Romania (Han et al. 1999) and Russia (Hubalek 2000) report a relationship between impoverished areas and disease rates. Very little data have been published regarding WNV and sociodemographic characteristics. However, a recent report comparing environmental conditions and socio-demographic characteristics identified three county types associated with WNV infections related to housing age, income and race in Chicago (Ruiz et al. 2007). The study here included an analysis of 21 socio-demographic variables and identified a relationship between socio-demographic variables and WNV infection rates. It also identified four county types which are positively linked to higher infection rates: 1) educated and affluent urban counties, 2) counties with less affluent young families, 3) economically dependent counties and 4) counties with older occupied housing. Is the response by public health officials at the county level appropriate relative to their perception of the threat posed by WNV in their jurisdictions? Previous research found public health officials have well developed surveillance and control programs (CSTE 2005). This research found that local level public health officials have in Ohio responded to WNV by implementing programs related to surveillance, control and prevention. Based on the results, the new activities and programs have been implemented by the majority of responding counties. The implication is that county-level public health officials perceive WNV as a threat to local populations."}, {"section_title": "Contributions of This Research", "text": "An earlier report by the CDC suggested the identification of disease risk factors as a means of preventing future infections (CDC 2003). After 10 years of experience with WNV in the United States future risk factor studies are still considered a priority by the CDC (Nasci 2009). As WNV is now considered endemic in the United States periodic outbreaks are to be expected (Komar 2009 Three levels of analysis were necessary to answer the research questions."}, {"section_title": "Level one: Diffusion of WNV across the Northeastern United States", "text": "The first level of analysis used CDC and USGS data to create county-level GIS maps which show the spread of WNV across the 14 states in the study area. WNV infection in birds is more widespread than in humans. Some similarity in clustering of avian infection and human cases is also observed."}, {"section_title": "Level Two: Analysis of County-level Socio-demographic Variables", "text": "This level of analysis answered the first two research questions. Part one of this level identifies county types associated with higher WNV infection rates within the study area. Part two of this level identifies errors in a priori classification of counties based on infection rates with discriminant analysis. Research Question 1: Can socio-demographic characteristics be identified and related to human cases of WNV infection? Hypothesis 1: Risk factors will vary by location. It is possible to identify socio-demographic characteristics that are related to human cases of WNV infection. This was achieved by using factor analysis. By using selected variables taken from census data, it was possible to identify characteristics which are associated with WNV infection. Socio-demographic characteristics can be used as risk factors as a means of predicting areas where future outbreaks could occur. Analysis of 21 socio-demographic variables selected from census data were reduced to five factors. These five factors accounted for 78.45% of variance in the dataset. Urban (factor 1, accounted for 33.36% of the variance, Economically Dependent (factor 2) accounted for 21.21% of the variance, Poverty Indicators (factor 3) accounted for 11.17% of the variance, Older Occupied Households (factor 4) accounted for 7.00% of the variance. The descriptive names for the four factors are associated with particular counties in the study area. In essence, the analysis has identified socio-demographic characteristics which facilitate the spread of WNV and may be considered risk factors for WNV infection. Research Question 2: Is there a particular type of county that is more frequently associated with cases of WNV? Hypothesis 2: Specific risk factors can be identified that relate to cases of WNV neurological disease. Hypothesis 3: Socio-demographic characteristics can be used to produce a classification of counties. This analysis identified four types of counties associated with WNV infection. Counties with a population that is educated and affluent, less affluent with young families, having high levels of poverty, low percentages of white residents and consisting of older housing stock facilitate the spread of WNV. Therefore, communities with large numbers of elderly, areas with low dependency ratios, and high percentages of white residents in the population contribute less to the diffusion of WNV. Age of housing, percentage of residents that were \"White\", and low income have previously been included in variables accounting for much of the variance in an earlier study which also used factor analysis (Ruiz et al. 2007). Hypothesis 5: Socio-demographic characteristics of the survey respondents influenced their perception of the risk presented by WNV. One of the most important findings of the research was the public health officials own ideas about the greatest obstacle to preventing the spread of WNV in their jurisdictions. General consensus is that more resources be made available to properly combat this pathogen. More staff and funds to pay workers and provide support for every aspect of surveillance, prevention and control are deemed necessary. Specifically, there is a great need for personnel with specialized training. The support and encouragement of public health organizations is needed to attract individuals into academic fields that will prepare them for infectious disease epidemiology which is crucial to the field."}, {"section_title": "Summary of Findings", "text": "The primary question asked by this research was \"Can socio-demographic characteristics be considered risk factors for neurological disease due to West Nile Comparing rural areas to urban areas was outside the scope of this dissertation. This type of comparison would identify characteristics specific to either urban or rural communities also provide data useful to public health officials in the prevention of human WNV disease. A similar study could be conducted in response to newly emergent diseases.
