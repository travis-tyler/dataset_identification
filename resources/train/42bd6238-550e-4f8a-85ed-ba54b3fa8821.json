Beginning in the mid-70's Vail and others (1977) used sequence stratigraphy to develop charts of regional sea-level changes, which they attempted to extrapolate to charts of global sea-level cycles. Attention has shifted away from using sequence stratigraphy to derive a sea-level curve and towards using sequence stratigraphy to investigate the geologic evolution of local and regional environments, as well as to predict the location of petroleum resources. Sequence stratigraphy is a tool, which aims to determine how sedimentary layers are assembled through time. It is often the geometric nature of surfaces between these layers that provides the most insight into their formation. These geometric relationships are largely controlled by accommodation, which is the space available for sediments to fill. Accommodation is created by increasing water depth and by tectonic subsidence. Contrary to many of the first models, sequence stratigraphy does not require any assumptions about eustasy, and its concepts are now being used to investigate a large variety of marine, lacustrine, fluvial, and even subaerial environments. The first models of sequence stratigraphy were built from observations in passive margin settings, but recently it has become clear that it is important to recognize the variability inherent in different settings. For example, tectonic deformation is a major factor creating and destroying accommodation, and this thesis focuses on how tectonic deformation influences sediment architecture. CHIRP seismic reflection profiles allow unprecedented high-resolution imaging of sediment architecture in sediments up to ~50 m below the sea floor. These sediments often include products of the last sea-level cycle (~120 ka -present), but can be older sediment and rock. Early seismic methods provided deeper seismic sections, but lower resolution. Through high-resolution investigation of the uppermost sediments and structures on the seafloor, CHIRP allows us to better link sedimentary successions observed in the rock record with modern, short time scale processes. In addition to seismic reflection methods, this work utilized coring and bathymetric surveys to ground-truth CHIRP profiles. Highly detailed assessments of the dominant processes generating the observed architectures were made by assembling the data into three-dimensional maps and visualizations. The results have implications for not only sequence stratigraphy, but also submarine canyon morphology and formation, nearshore sediment dynamics, sand resources for beach replenishment, and fluvial geomorphology."}, {"section_title": "OVERVIEW OF STUDY", "text": "This thesis examines the question of how tectonics influences stratigraphic architecture by examining seismic profiles, high-resolution bathymetry, and core data in two distinct tectonic settings. The first focus site, the La Jolla margin, is located in the California Borderlands, an area marked by strike-slip faulting. The major tectonic feature is the Rose Canyon Fault Zone, a right-lateral, strike-slip fault creating deformation on and offshore. Horizontal motion on the fault within the Holocene is estimated at 1-2 mm/ yr. Sediment supply to the region, consisting mostly of fine sands, is low. Episodic input from rivers to the north is transported south via longshore drift within the Oceanside littoral cell, and sea cliff erosion augments this source. The Eel margin, located in northern California, is a forearc basin setting overprinted by the influence of northward migration of the Mendocino Triple Junction. This imparts a highly complex pattern of active thrust faults, anticlines, and synclines oriented perpendicular to the shoreline. Horizontal motion on faults reaches ~6 mm/yr, and uplift and subsidence of these structures reaches a maximum of ~3 mm/yr. Sediment supply to the shelf is large, with steep, mountainous rivers wearing down relatively easily eroded rock. Normalized to its basin area, the sediment supply of the Eel River is larger than that of any other river in the contiguous United States. Furthermore, several similarly sediment rich rivers yield additional discharge to the Eel shelf. Both settings have an ideal geometry to separate the effects of eustatic sea-level fluctuations from those of tectonic deformation: structural variability is predominantly along shore, that is orthogonal to the variations due to eustasy. In southern California, the low sediment supply with very little organic matter results in very little internal structure in sediment units, making it necessary to draw conclusions from larger geometric relationships. In northern California, however, the huge influx of sediment leads to greater resolution within the seismic packages and more geometric clues to interpret their evolution."}, {"section_title": "OUTLINE OF THE DISSERTATION", "text": "The second and third chapters of this thesis present results from southern California, and the fourth and fifth chapters focus on northern California.

We propose that our observation of a popup structure offshore, created by a constraining bend along the right-lateral Rose Canyon fault zone, controls the long-term accumulation of sediment in this region of the nearshore.\nThree independent variables: eustatic sea-level fluctuation, tectonic subsidence/ uplift, and sediment supply control the development of stratigraphic patterns and associated facies (e.g., Sloss, 1963). In addition, climate and physiography of the margin play an important role in the generation of stratigraphic architecture (Christie-Blick and . Numerous attempts have been made to understand how changes in these variables affect the stratigraphic record; that is, trying to define the link between process and product. Sequence stratigraphy is an approach to determine layer-by-layer how sedimentary successions are put together, from the smallest elements to the largest, as well as to understand the origin of the physical surfaces that bound depositional building blocks. Despite many efforts to understand how changes in these variables affect the stratigraphic record, controversy remains regarding the importance of tectonics versus eustatic sea-level change on generating sequence architecture. The general concepts of sequence stratigraphy represent a distillation of numerous observations along many passive margins , Van Wagoner et al., 1990). One of the major assumptions of the sequence stratigraphic model is that there is a constant subsidence rate that increases uniformly from the hinge zone basinward or seaward in response to cooling and contraction of the mantle or sediment loading. Furthermore, sediment input during a sea-level cycle is assumed to be constant or experience a slight increase during sea-level fall as a result of increased erosion and incision . Even though it is explicit that local factors such as tectonic deformation and variations in sediment supply must be considered when applying the sequence stratigraphic model, it remains unclear how such local factors will modify the formation of discontinuities and the stratigraphic sequences they bound. In this manuscript, we will present new data acquired as part of the Office of Naval Research (ONR) STRATAFORM project that will illustrate how variations in tectonic deformation and sediment supply modify the architecture of the transgressive sequence on the northern California margin. Following Christie-Blick and , the depositional sequence is defined as a relatively conformable succession of genetically related strata bounded by unconformities and their correlative conformities. Although an unconformity is generally defined as a buried surface of erosion and/or non-deposition, in the application of sequence stratigraphy it has been restricted to those surfaces that are related (or are inferred to be related) at least locally to the lowering of depositional base level and hence to subaerial erosion or bypassing (Van Wagoner et al., 1988). According to this definition, intervals bounded by marine erosion surfaces that do not pass laterally into subaerial discontinuities are not sequences and the bounding unconformities are not sequence boundaries. In the standard sequence stratigraphic model, \"parasequences\" and \"parasequence sets\" are the building blocks that make up the three different \"systems tracts\" (Brown and Fisher, 1977) that compose a sequence. Parasequences are characterized by overall upward shoaling of depositional facies bounded by marine flooding surface and their correlative surfaces ( Fig. 1; Vail Van Wagoner et al., 1988, 1990Swift et al., 1991). The balance between sediment supply and accommodation governs their overall stacking patterns and facies arrangements, and these factors determine which systems tract they compose. For example, when sediment supply outpaces the creation of new accommodation the sedimentary sequences prograde across the margin with a seaward migration of the shoreline and associated facies (e.g., LST, Fig. 1). Conversely, if the creation of new accommodation outpaces the sediment supply there will be a shoreward migration of parasequences and associated facies (e.g., TST, Fig. 1). It is these stacking patterns that define the various system tracts and provide important linkages between facies assemblages and stratal geometry. One of the main goals of this research is to examine the relationship between facies assemblages and stratal geometry on a tectonically active margin. Subdivision of sequences into the three different systems tracts, highstand, transgressive, and lowstand, depends on the phase lag between transgressive-regressive cycles and the development of sequence boundaries (Fig. 1). In the standard model for a siliciclastic environment with a shelf-slope break, the regressive part of any cycle includes both the highstand and lowstand (or shelf margin) systems tracts, with the highstand below the sequence boundary and the lowstand above. On the shelf, alternating transgressive and highstand units predominate, but are not always easy to distinguish (Christie-Blick and . Furthermore, the transgressive systems tract can be nearly absent or relatively thick depending on the depositional environment. For example, low-gradient settings typically have thin transgressive sequences, but these deposits can be thick if transgression is punctuated by short, regressive intervals . Conversely, in high-gradient, high sediment supply settings, transgressive deposits can develop up to tens of meters thick locally above a high-gradient wave ravinement surface . Other factors such as inherent physiography, tidal and wave energy, and dominant sediment grain size of a margin can play a role in transgressive deposit geometry. The nested approach of the northern California STRATAFORM focus site provides the ideal opportunity for us to examine how the stratal patterns along an active margin respond to different rates of tectonic deformation, variations in sediment supply, and different sediment source regions. Researchers have attempted to develop modified versions of the standard sequence stratigraphic model with case studies in a variety of settings. Examples include settings where sedimentation is accompanied by growth faulting (Brown and Fisher, 1977); carbonate platforms and ramps (Brown and Fisher, 1977;MacNeil and Jones, 2006); and nonmarine settings such as fluvial, eolian, and lacustrine environments (Dam and Surlyk, 1992;Lawton et al., 2003). The main emphasis of this work has been to document variations in the arrangement of facies and associated stratal geometry. Researchers have also sought deeper understanding by integrating outcrop and subsurface geology from seismic records with flume experiments (Koss et al., 1994;Wood et al., 1993) and computer simulations (e.g., Ross et al., 1990;Driscoll and Karner, 1999). Some have even used computer simulations to predict facies distributions and geometries in areas unconstrained by well-log or seismic data (e.g., Warrlich et al., 2008) and numerical models to test sequence stratigraphic model assumptions (e.g., . Among the more interesting results of this work are the new ideas and concepts concerning the origin of sequences and their bounding unconformities. The high-resolution data acquired during the STRATAFORM project has provided an opportunity to test and refine some of these new concepts regarding strata formation. Using the sequence stratigraphic approach (Vail et al., , 1991Vail, 1987;Christie-Blick et al., 1990;Van Wagoner et al., 1990;Driscoll and Karner, 1998) to interpret the preserved stratal geometry in a basin allows a chronostratigraphic framework to be established with which to examine the preserved basinal lithostratigraphy. Vail et al. (1991) state that the most important criteria necessary to discern between tectonic activity, eustatic sea-level fluctuations, and sediment supply are the distribution in time and space of their effects on accommodation. Furthermore, these authors suggest that these processes can be differentiated by examining their rates, their duration, their rate of change or pattern of change, and finally the spatial extent of the modification Vail et al., 1991). However, in actively deforming regions, such as the northern California margin, the rates of these disparate processes can have similar magnitudes of millimeters per year (Underhill, 1991;Driscoll, 1992;Driscoll and Karner, 1998). Consequently, caution should be used when using rates to infer process because rates are not always the key to discern between tectonics and eustasy. Furthermore,  and Posamentier and James (1993) emphasize that sequence stratigraphic models are generally applicable and that the effects of local factors such as climate, sediment supply, and tectonics must be incorporated into these models before they can be applied to a particular basin. While this is an easy caveat to mention, it requires an a priori geologic understanding of a given region. This type of reasoning places the proverbial cart in front of the horse because it is the technique of sequence stratigraphy that is used to understand the interplay between, and importance of, regional (allocyclic) versus local (autocyclic) processes. On active margins such as the west coast of North America, tectonics plays an important role in generating morphology and subsequent stratigraphic architecture on the continental shelf (e.g., . The Eel River Basin in northern California is an ideal location to investigate the different influences of tectonics, eustasy, and sediment supply. Northeast-southwest compression due to the encroachment of the Mendocino Triple Junction generates folds and high-angle reverse faults with axes oriented at a high angle to the shoreline. The tectonic signal has variable sign and amplitude parallel to the coastline, providing an opportunity to examine how tectonic deformation affects stratigraphic architecture and facies assemblages. In addition, the large, episodic sediment yield to the margin results in thick sedimentary packages with well-preserved geometry. The localization of sediment sources in subsiding synclines also enhances along-shore variability in sedimentation, which improves understanding of the role of sediment supply in generating sequence geometry. In 1994 the ONR STRATAFORM project aimed to bridge the gap between time scales of sedimentary processes and strata formation . The program combined studies that examined cores, CHIRP seismics, and Multi-Channel Seismics (e.g.,  to study processes that generate marine strata spanning a range of time scales from days to millennia to hundreds of millennia. In this study, we use high resolution CHIRP seismic data to examine the products of the most recent transgression. Taking into account our current understanding of the modern shelf depositional and erosional processes allows us to better evaluate the roles of sediment input and dispersal, tectonic deformation, eustasy, and physiography in the formation of the stratigraphic record. By interpreting high resolution CHIRP seismic data in a sequence stratigraphic context, we are able to develop a detailed understanding of the formation of the transgressive systems tract on a tectonically active shelf during the most recent sea-level rise.\nConceptual models have considered shelf physiography to be the main factor governing deposition versus incision on the shelf during relative sea-level (RSL) fall (e.g., Posamentier et al., 1992). The widely held view is that sea-level fall leads to a decrease in accommodation, cross-shelf valley incision, and transport of fluvial sediment to the slope or deep ocean ( Fig. 1; . Some researchers attribute this to the fact that as RSL falls, rivers extend across the shelf, are closer to the shelf edge, and can more easily distribute their sediments over the shelf edge Mulder and Syvitski, 1996). Other models predict that the rivers will respond according to the change in slope of the system as RSL falls ( Fig. 2; Posamentier et al., 1992;. In these models, the most common scenario is that with a RSL fall, a steeper gradient is exposed and thus, fluvial incision is initiated at the river mouth, upstream knickpoint migration ensues, and the river incises a channel on the newly exposed shelf ( Fig. 2A). When there is no change in slope, no aggradation or degradation occurs (Fig. 2B). At the other extreme, if the newly exposed shelf has a slope less than that of the original fluvial profile, the rate of river flow will diminish and sediments will accumulate on the inner shelf (Fig. 2C). Evidence in the stratigraphic record of the latter appears to be either rare or at least interpreted incorrectly (Ainsworth and Pattison, 1994). The geometry of the shelf is often more complex and the presence of a relatively steep shoreface due to a highstand delta or coastal prism can lead to incision of the coastal highstand deposits ( Fig. 3A; Posamentier et al., 1992;Talling, 1998;. The shallower slope of the coastal prism compared to that of the shelf results in an increase in slope and consequent incision of the coastal plain (Posamentier et al., 1992). Furthermore, the importance of RSL dropping below the shelf edge has been realized; if sea level does not fall below the shelf edge, incision across the entire shelf can be limited ( Fig. 3; Talling, 1998;. For example,  showed that the Gulf of Mexico shelf, with a relatively shallow shelf/slope break (~30-50 m shallower than LGM sea level), developed deep, cross-shelf incised valleys and lowstand slope deltas during the last sea-level fall. Conversely, the Bay of Biscay shelf, with a shelf/slope break > 20 m deeper than the LGM sea level exhibited little channel incision. Results from recent numerical models and experiments challenge the classic conceptual model by implying that during initial RSL fall, many settings will experience a period of sediment aggradation. For example, the one-dimensional numerical model and flume experiments of   indicate that there is a delay between exposure of the shelf and fluvial erosion during the sea-level fall. In their experiments, when sea level reaches the shelf edge, headward erosion begins to erode the shelf edge, eventually propagating updip and cannibalizing older distributary channel deposits. The connection rate, that is how quickly the cross shelf erosion commences, depends on the degree of headward erosion at the shelf edge and shelf width, and it controls much of the dynamics of the ultimate degree of erosion and deposition on the shelf. These models imply that widespread sediment accumulation on the shelf is possible during sea-level fall and that the influence of preexisting morphology on aggradation versus incision is more complex than previously thought. Here we present new evidence of subaerial accommodation during sea-level lowstand on the Eel Margin. Lowstand deposits observed in CHIRP seismic data and sampled by cores give insight into their environment of formation, and we discuss several factors that could have led to their deposition and preservation.

Nearshore strike lines were collected in 1998 onboard the R/V Coral Sea, and regional dip lines were acquired in 1999 and 2000 onboard the R/V Thompson. The regional dip lines coincided with coring transects, and vibracore numbers indicate their locations on survey lines as well as their water depths. For example, core Q45 was collected coincident with dip line Q at 45 m water depth (Fig. 4). Vibracores, box cores, and piston cores collected across the study area provide some information about the nature of facies and contacts observed in seismic data. The cruise tracks were designed to provide (a) detailed dip line coverage (~1.75 km line spacing) from the outer shelf/upper slope across the shelf into shallow water (~20 m) and (b) detailed strike line coverage (~250 m line spacing) of the fold/fault system and overlying sediment thickness on the inner shelf. For the regional dip and strike lines a 1-5.5 kHz chirp signal with a 50 ms sweep was used, while for the nearshore surveys a 1-15 kHz chirp signal with a 10 ms sweep gave better vertical resolution and minimized time between shots. These signals yielded submeter vertical resolution to subsurface depths up to 50 m. Data were corrected for ship heave using SIOSEIS  and further processed using Seismic Unix . To correct for layback, one set of survey lines collected at one azimuth was held constant and the navigation for other lines was shifted to match the fixed lines. The total offset between lines was up to ~ 200 m, which was not significant enough to influence correlation with structures onshore. Kingdom Software (Seismic Micro Technology http://www.seismicmicro.com) was used to determine depths to interpreted surfaces as well as thickness of intervening units. An average of 1500 m/s was used to convert two way travel time to depth. Generic Mapping Tools (GMT; http:// gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/) was used to apply a continuous curvature surface algorithm and interior tension of 0.35 to convert data points to grid surfaces.

To the north of the Eureka Anticline, a second surface is imaged below the transgressive surface. This surface may also be present to the south of the anticline, but widespread gas wipe-out in that area limits acoustic penetration. The surface is generally characterized by high reflectivity (e.g., Line 8; Fig. 7), but the reflector in some areas fades and becomes indistinct (e.g., Line T; Fig.   6). The high-amplitude reflector is characterized by several wide (100s of meters), shallow (meters) erosional features (Figs. L7 and 6). In dip lines, the surface is observed between ~45 and 60 m water depth. The surface slopes gently and is truncated by the transgressive surface in ~65 m water depth (Figs. 6 and 10). Shoreward of the ~45 m isobath the acoustic amplitude of the surface systematically decreases shoreward (Fig.   6). In strike lines, however, the surface is imaged both at the depths imaged in dip lines and at shallower depths in the northern part of the study area, offshore of the Mad River. In strike, the surface is absent over the Eureka Anticline, but its northern extent is not imaged and likely continues to the north. A structure map of this surface shows that it a lower slope than the bathymetry (Fig. 11A). The sediment unit between this surface and the transgressive surface ranges between ~5-15 m thick and is generally acoustically transparent. Locally there are areas with parallel, low-amplitude reflectors ( Fig. 7) and other areas characterized by dipping, concave, and nested reflectors (Fig. 8). The southern extent of the unit is unclear, as several high-amplitude reflectors at variable depths are present, likely indicating gas. It is clear, however, that the unit is absent over the Eureka Anticline (Fig. 10). The sediments of this unit are observed both in the channels formed in the lower surface and the adjacent interfluve regions (Figs. 7,8,and 9). At shallower depths, a distinctly nested channel appears to have sediment preserved in the interfluves as well (Fig. 9). An isopach map of these sediments shows that they are absent on top of the structural highs, have an alongshore extent of at least 15 km, appear thickest to the north of Eureka Anticline, and thin seaward (Fig. 11B). A number of cores were acquired as part of the STRATAFORM initiative , however, only one core collected along line Q penetrated the transgressive surface and sampled ~50 cm of sediment from the unit described here (see Fig. 5 for location). This sediment was bluish gray fine silt and clay with a sulfide odor and rhizome root structures."}, {"section_title": "GEOLOGY, March 2007", "text": "time to sediment thickness.

On the basis of terrace offsets, these faults are older than 120 ka . If such a fault caused uplift of the more resistant Del Mar Formation to the north with respect to the less resistant Scripps Formation to the south, we would expect a jog of isobaths seaward as the more resistant Del Mar Formation formed a promontory.

If this scenario were correct, it would not predict that the isobaths should return shoreward north of the fault (Fig. 5A), and the faults would cause a marked local thickness change across the fault from the downdropped to the upthrown block (e.g., Fig. 2A). The lateral extent of the depocenter exhibits a wavelength longer than that of the onshore downdropped block bounded by the Salk and Torrey Pines faults ( Figs. 1 and 4). Furthermore, the Carmel Valley fault onshore is down to the north; i.e., the sense of motion across the fault is opposite to that predicted by the observed sediment thickness. Alternatively, in a pop-up or constraining bend scenario, a left jog in a right-lateral fault zone would cause the thickness of the transgressive deposits to thin systematically from the depocenter toward the structural high without a sharp local thickness change ( Fig. 5B). Such a constraining bend would predict that the isobaths shift seaward at the south end and return shoreward at the north end of the pop-up structure, which is consistent with the isobaths deeper than ~60 m ( Fig. 4; see also the regional National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Geophysical Data Center 3-arc-second coastal relief model [http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/coastal/ grddas06/grddas06.htm]). A gentle, long-wavelength uplift of the transgressive surface is observed in the seismic images, consistent with a left jog along the Rose Canyon fault zone. The relief on the transgressive surface is largest in the west near the jog in the Rose Canyon fault (e.g., 26.5 m; Fig. 2A) and diminishes eastward away from the jog (e.g., 21.5 m; Fig. 2B), as would be predicted by the pop-up hypothesis (    2005and unfi lled for previous study .\n\n"}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "High-resolution geophysical data suggest that uplift offshore La Jolla, California, results from a left jog along the Rose Canyon right-lateral fault system, similar to the process responsible for forming Mount Soledad onshore.

The importance of underlying structures in controlling the formation and evolution of morphological features and sediment accumulation has long been appreciated . Several studies illustrate the influence of tectonic deformation on geomorphology, such as continental slope morphology on tectonically active margins  or drainage patterns and formation of fluvial terraces . Long-term retreat of modern beaches , the preservation and evolution of barrier-island systems , and short-term dynamic processes such as the position and stability of sandbars in the nearshore , are also affected by underlying structures. Here we present new geophysical and geological data that show the importance of tectonic deformation in controlling canyon location and morphology and modern sediment distribution offshore La Jolla, California. The sedimentary and morphological evolution of continental margins depends on many factors, three of which are eustasy, sediment supply, and tectonic deformation (Christie-Blick and . Discerning how these parameters affect sediment accumulation is often difficult even when the factors are operating at different spatial scales Lee, 2003, 2004). On active margins tectonics plays a large role in controlling the nearshore physiography. In our study site, the shoreparallel deformation caused by transpression and transtension associated with the dextral Rose Canyon Fault (Fig. 1) can be isolated from the cross-shore oriented base-level changes imparted by regional tectonic uplift and eustatic sea-level fluctuations. Our work examines how local deformation affects the relief on the transgressive surface, which in turn, plays an important role in controlling regions of sediment bypass and accumulation. a b s t r a c t a r t i c l e i n f o tectonic deformation submarine canyon morphology nearshore sediment accumulation CHIRP seismic and swath bathymetry data acquired offshore La Jolla, California provide an unprecedented three-dimensional view of the La Jolla and Scripps submarine canyons. Shore-parallel patterns of tectonic deformation appear to control nearshore sediment thickness and distribution around the canyons. These shore-parallel patterns allow the impact of local tectonic deformation to be separated from the influence of eustatic sea-level fluctuations. Based on stratal geometry and acoustic character, we identify a prominent angular unconformity inferred to be the transgressive surface and three sedimentary sequences: an acoustically laminated estuarine unit deposited during early transgression, an infilling or \"healing-phase\" unit formed during the transgression, and an upper transparent unit. Beneath the transgressive surface, steeply dipping reflectors with several dip reversals record faulting and folding along the La Jolla margin. Scripps Canyon is located at the crest of an antiform, where the rocks are fractured and more susceptible to erosion. La Jolla Canyon is located along the northern strand of the Rose Canyon Fault Zone, which separates Cretaceous lithified rocks to the south from poorly cemented Eocene sands and gravels to the north. Isopach and structure contour maps of the three sedimentary units reveal how their thicknesses and spatial distributions relate to regional tectonic deformation. For example, the estuarine unit is predominantly deposited along the edges of the canyons in paleotopographic lows that may have been inlets along barrier beaches during the Holocene sea-level rise. The distribution of the infilling unit is controlled by pre-existing relief that records tectonic deformation and erosional processes. The thickness and distribution of the upper transparent unit are controlled by long-wavelength, tectonically induced relief on the transgressive surface and hydrodynamics. \u00a9 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The transgressive systems tract of the Eel River shelf is composed of two acoustic units, a healing-phase deposit that smooths seafloor roughness and an upper transgressive unit of aggrading, backstepping marine deposits. On the shelf offshore of the Eel River, sediments erode off the highs and accumulate in the lows, creating expanded sections. Along-strike variability in accommodation due to tectonic deformation is the major control on long-term accumulation. Hydrodynamic forcing appears to control shorter-term sediment dispersal, but its influence is also apparent in long-term crossshore sediment distribution. In the Eel River Basin, the location and extent of the midshelf thickness maximum depends on the wave climate and sediment size distribution characteristic of the margin. High sediment input and slowing sea-level rise may have brought about the transition from the transgressive systems tract to the highstand systems tract. The geometry of reflectors within the transgressive sequence indicates the relative timing of sedimentation and deformation; offset of the transgressive surface and diverging reflectors in the upper transgressive sediments indicate that deposition is syntectonic with rates of approximately 3 mm/yr. Onshore to offshore correlation of structures is tenuous as many structures onshore appear to die away offshore and those offshore appear to die off onshore, attesting to the highly three-dimensional deformation in the region.\nA seaward thinning wedge beneath the transgressive surface is imaged in the CHIRP data. The geometry of this wedge and core data suggest it is fluvial and estuarine deposition recording accommodation on the shelf during the last sea-level fall or lowstand. Several researchers have suggested that high fluvial gradients relative to the shelf slope may lead to deposition on the shelf during lowstand (Fig. 2C). However, in the actively uplifting area onshore of the Eel River Basin, it is not clear that this criteria is met. Although the mountainous terrain has a much steeper gradient than that of the shelf, modern river gradients are nearly equal to slope of the shelf. Creation of accommodation due to rapid subsidence of synclines may play a role offshore of the Eel River, but it is not clear that this mechanism works for the Mad River, where we observe the most lowstand deposition. New stratigraphic modeling purports that there is a link between fluviodeltaic response time and sediment accumulation on the shelf during early lowstand, which might explain the observations in the Eel River Basin. It is more likely that lowstand sea level did not descend below the shelf edge for a sufficient period of time to create erosion and connect to onshore distributary channels. However, it is also likely that several of these factors contributed to sediment deposition and subsequent preservation on the shelf during the last sea-level fall. These results have generated insight into the connection between marine stratigraphic and sedimentological observations and fluvial morphodynamics throughout a sea-level cycle. The absence of incised channels on the Eel Margin suggests that small, high-gradient river systems vary little in their sediment yield throughout the sea-level cycle, whereas larger, low-gradient rivers with large onshore storage capacities during highstand yield comparatively large amounts of sediment during lowstand. The research on the Eel Margin helps connect marine stratigraphic and sedimentological observations and fluvial morphodynamics throughout a sea-level cycle. Based on our observations, we predict the following: Type 1 rivers will have large lowstand deposits as the incised valleys reactivate onshore distributary networks with large storage capacity. Type 2 rivers will have small lowstand deposits as the onshore storage capacity is small and furthermore sediment yield to the margin from Type 2 rivers will exhibit much less variability throughout a sea-level cycle. This concept evolves from the fact that we have two very different types of rivers. As such, we would expect that much/most of the present-day fluvial sediment supplied to the oceans is from small mountainous rivers (Type 2), but during a period of regressive sea level -perhaps a short period -sediment discharge may be dominated by Type 1 rivers in response to the erosion of subaerially accommodated sediment. Thus, while the small mountainous rivers are more responsive to short-term events (e.g. floods, storms), large low-gradient river systems might be more responsive to sea-level change."}, {"section_title": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "This research was funded by the Offi ce of Naval Research and the Kavli Institute.

Navigation for the seismic data was measured using a second GPS receiver mounted on the surface tow frame. During the offshore survey in 2003 onboard the R/V Sproul, only seismic data were collected and the SUBSCAN system was towed at approximately 10 m above the seafloor. Winch cable payout records were used to correct layback offsets during post-processing. Data were acquired at a ship speed of approximately 4-5 knots during both surveys. During a scuba dive on Dec 14th 2007, a short push core was acquired from a layer that outcrops along a ridge at 23 m water depth near the head of La Jolla Canyon (Figs. 2 and 3B). The site was selected to ground-truth one of the stratigraphic packages identified in the seismic data, which has a laminated acoustic character and outcrops in this area.

Healing-phase deposits have been referred to as transgressive backfill or transgressive lag (e.g., Cattaneo 4. Discussion\nThree sedimentary units and their relative ages have been identified in the seismic data based on stratal geometry, acoustic character, and analyses of sediment samples where available. We interpret Sequence I, the highly reflective unit observed near the canyons and sampled by push core, as an estuarine or lagoonal deposit, consistent with previous findings that the sediments within the head of La Jolla Canyon were deposited in an estuarine environment . The presence of ostracods in sediment samples recovered from the head of La Jolla Canyon at water depths of 23 m ) is indicative of deposition within a brackish water environment. Radiocarbon dates of root structures within the same horizon yielded ages of 8270 \u00b1 500 years b.p. . Often age dates derived from woody debris overestimate the age of deposition as wood can have some residence time in the watershed, however, this does not apply to in situ root structures. The ostracods were found in sediments outcropping from 16 to 27 m water depth , which is consistent with the sediment thickness observed in CHIRP seismic data from this region. During transgression, the canyons may have acted as inlets to low lying areas landward of the beach similar to what is observed at Penasquitos Lagoon today. These low areas are potential locations where late-lowstand or earlytransgressive subaerial deposits may be preserved between the sequence boundary and overlying transgressive surface. Similar estuarine units appear to be deposited along Scripps Canyon in similar water depths (Fig. 6). Farther offshore, we interpret Sequence II, the basal sediments infilling lows or notches in the transgressive surface (Figs. 5 and 7), as a transgressive deposit, often referred to as a healing-phase wedge . Healing-phase deposits have been referred to as transgressive backfill or transgressive lag (e.g., Cattaneo and Steel, 2003 and references therein).  interpreted this unit to be several different marine and nonmarine deposits of late Pleistocene age. Sequence III, the upper acoustically transparent unit is interpreted to be a late-transgressive to highstand unit comprising unconsolidated sands, consistent with . The geometries and locations of the three sedimentary units in the area reflect the interplay of tectonics, eustasy, and sediment supply. We are able to distinguish the influences of eustasy and local transpressional tectonics based on geometry; transpression on the RCFZ imparts a shore-parallel trend while effects due to sea-level change and longterm, regional tectonic deformation engender a cross-shore trend . As sea level rises and a shoreline transgresses, areas of the coastal plain landward of the shoreline become potential areas of aggradation. In the case where sediment supply outpaces upper shoreface erosion, estuarine deposits can be preserved, in particular within channel incisions and embayments. As sea level continues to rise, erosion of the upper shoreface provides sediments to infill, or \"heal,\" the lows in the lower shoreface and on the shelf . These lows usually occur seaward of notches that are likely a consequence of relative sea level still stands (Fig. 7B). In some cases, the location of these notches is also influenced by the presence of back-tilted blocks, which allowed for differential erosion (Fig. 7B). The lows are subsequently backfilled as the shoreline migrates landward, eroding the coastline, with the consequent coarse-grained lag deposited offshore. As the transgression continues, so-called healingphase deposits overlie the preserved estuarine sediments, as observed in strike lines (N20 m) around Scripps Canyon (Figs. 7A and 8). As the Scripps and La Jolla submarine canyons cut across the entire shelf into the nearshore, the upper reaches of these features constitute embayments that are conducive to the deposition of estuarine sediments. In the case of La Jolla Canyon (Fig. 6), estuarine deposits found at shallow depths (\u223c 10-15 m) are inferred to be late-Holocene in age as a lagoon still occupied this site only 100 years ago and extended \u223c1 mile to the east of the current La Jolla Shores Beach . These thick estuarine deposits crop out in some areas, in particular along isolated ridges within the head of La Jolla Canyon (Fig. 6). Most likely, wave and tidal energy efficiently reworks sediments or prevents the deposition of modern sands over the estuarine units that outcrop at shallow water depths. Beyond the primary features controlled by eustasy and long-term tectonic deformation, we observe tectonically induced secondary relief on the transgressive surface. The pop-up structure associated with the constraining bend on the Rose Canyon Fault generates a local northward shoaling trend on the transgressive surface (Fig. 8). The antiform through which Scripps Canyon is incised is an influential secondary structure as well. Operating at smaller wavelengths, deformation and offset bedding associated with east-west trending faults create along-shore variability in the transgressive surface and appear to influence the pattern of modern sediment deposition. The most significant example of this deformation is the localized structural high north of Scripps Canyon associated with the Carmel Valley and Salk faults on land (Figs. 4 and 8). The area between these two oblique faults appears to be uplifted relative to the surrounding area ( Figs. 1 and 5). Both the large-wavelength uplift associated with the pop-up structure and the short-wavelength deformation associated with these oblique faults create along-shore relief in the transgressive surface (Figs. 4, 5, and 9B). The healing-phase wedge is confined to the saddle region away from the canyons. Similar infilling of lows in the antecedent topography during transgression has been observed elsewhere (e.g., on the northern California shelf, . North of Scripps Canyon, the northern Holocene depocenter and much of the alongshore thickness variability observed in the Holocene sequence correspond to variations in the basal healing-phase unit (Fig. 10A and B). Such a correlation is not observed in the inter-canyon shelf where the transparent upper sands appear to account for the majority of the sediment thickness in the depocenter (Fig. 10A, B, and C). The depression in the transgressive surface is more pronounced north of Scripps Canyon than in the inter-canyon shelf (Fig. 9B). This is likely due to the positive uplift associated with the pop-up structure to the north and the shoaling of the transgressive surface towards the RCFZ in the south. The reflectors observed in the healing-phase deposits of the northern depocenter are horizontal and on-lap the transgressive surface (Fig. 7A). This indicates that offset on the Carmel Valley and Salk faults, and more importantly, uplift of the pop-up structure pre-date deposition of the healing-phase unit. Some of the relief on the transgressive surface is modified by wave erosion in the nearshore, which enhances the smoothness of the seafloor as coarse-grained sediments eroded from the shoreface are transported to the low areas offshore (Fig. 10B). For example, faultinduced roughness in the transgressive surface is preserved in deeper water because these areas were more rapidly transgressed. We interpret the overall decrease in the relief on the transgressive surface from offshore to onshore, which greatly influences the location of healing-phase deposits, as a consequence of the varying rates of sealevel rise during the last transgression ( Fig. 5; . With decreasing rate of sea-level rise, the shallower part of the shelf was exposed to wave-based erosion over a longer period and existing structures were more effectively leveled. This pattern of increased roughness offshore is likely enhanced by the overprinting of erosion during several sea-level cycles."}, {"section_title": "Hydrodynamic control on modern sediment accumulation", "text": "The distribution of the upper Holocene sediment package in the along-shore direction is affected by hydrodynamic factors (wind, waves, and currents), sediment supply, and antecedent topography.

Given the 8270 y.b.p. age for underlying estuarine sediments , this sets the upper age limit for the overlying acoustically transparent sequence. The structure contour map of the top of Sequence II (Fig. 9C) shows that the relief along the transgressive surface (Fig. 9B) has been diminished by the healingphase wedge, leaving a relatively smooth inner shelf profile with a seaward dip and minor along-shore variability. North of Scripps Canyon, unconsolidated sediments are thickest at \u223c 40 m water depth ( Fig. 10C) and thin both seaward and landward (Figs. 7B, 8, 10A, and C). The depocenter records the depth from which average waves can no longer resuspend sediment (Fig. 10C). Transport beyond the depocenter only occurs infrequently during larger storm events, which may explain the observed offshore thinning (e.g., ). In the northern part of our survey area, offshore Torrey Pines State Park, very little modern sediment deposition occurs at shallow water depths as the mid-shelf thickness high is deflected seaward due to the shoaling of the transgressive surface ( Fig. 10A and C).

Observation of sediment wasting events in the heads of Scripps Canyon  and related studies involving mass balance estimates for littoral cell sediment budgets  have led the research community to conclude that the majority of sediment is captured and transported offshore by Scripps Canyon. However, our data shows that modern sediment accumulation offshore La Jolla may be more complex.

Mass balance calculations by  suggested that much of the sediment supplied by longshore drift escaped the littoral cell via Scripps Canyon. Nevertheless, our observations suggest that large amounts of sediment have bypassed Scripps Canyon, despite the narrow pathway between the canyon head and the beach. The large along-shore variation in wave heights observed near Scripps Canyon may be a mechanism for enhanced sediment transport within the surf zone shoreward of the Scripps Canyon head. Thus, we need to reassess the role of the La Jolla Canyon System on sediment accumulation on the inner shelf and evaluate the proportion of sand captured by the canyon versus that shunted southward to the inter-canyon depocenter. Observations of modern sediment accumulation on the San Diego County shelf, which provide a perspective on the regional pattern, confirm that the inner shelf offshore La Jolla, California is generally a depocenter of modern sediments. Regional studies reveal that exposed bedrock is common between the mid-shelf wedge and the beach, except at river mouths . Outside of the two areas of uplift due to the RCFZ, there are no bedrock exposures offshore La Jolla between the mid-shelf wedge and the beach. Our study area appears to be characterized by an atypically large accumulation of young sediment. The westward step of the coastline at the southern extremity of the Oceanside littoral cell may act as a jetty and promote sediment accumulation. The well-developed rip currents consistently observed south of the Scripps Pier at La Jolla Shores beach  and also immediately north of the Scripps Pier  are likely contributing to this net accumulation. These currents redistribute modern sediments seaward on the inter-canyon shelf  and contribute to the formation of the depocenter observed in the isopach maps. Repeated sounding surveys performed between 1949 and 1950  and seismic surveys conducted in 1976 and 1979 with a 3.5 kHz seismic profiler  indicate that sand levels are fairly stable on short time scales (1 to 3 years) at the location where we have identified the upper Holocene depocenter in the inter-canyon shelf. However, both accretion and erosion dynamics have been reported . This would imply that the Holocene sediment depocenter is currently in near equilibrium, with little net influx or outflux over at least the last few decades. A welldefined scour mark due to dredging is observed at 20 m water depth to the north of our study area (see . The preservation of this feature after the dredging occurred indicates that longshore drift is currently limited to the nearshore region.

We observe widespread dip reversals in the bedrock and an increased dip of offshore units compared to those observed onshore.

The primarily along-shore variation in the local tectonic structure allows us to distinguish the influences of eustasy and transpressional tectonics. The deposition pattern of the two older packages appears to be structurally controlled, with lagoonal deposits limited to the shallow upper reaches of the canyons and the healing-phase deposits infilling the lows seaward of wave-cut notches. The accumulation of the younger sand unit is controlled in large part by local hydrodynamics, with a typical mid-shelf depocenter north of Scripps Canyon and between the canyons.

We identify three stratigraphic sequences overlying the acoustic bedrock offshore La Jolla: 1) estuarine deposits, 2) a healing-phase wedge, and 3) homogeneous sands. We interpret the spatial distribution of these modern stratigraphic units in light of the complex interaction between sea-level rise, tectonics, and sediment supply. The primarily along-shore variation in the local tectonic structure allows us to distinguish the influences of eustasy and transpressional tectonics. The deposition pattern of the two older packages appears to be structurally controlled, with lagoonal deposits limited to the shallow upper reaches of the canyons and the healing-phase deposits infilling the lows seaward of wave-cut notches. The accumulation of the younger sand unit is controlled in large part by local hydrodynamics, with a typical mid-shelf depocenter north of Scripps Canyon and between the canyons. The identification of this depocenter raises questions about the efficiency of Scripps Canyon in capturing sediments and refines our conceptual model for the Holocene sediment transport and deposition offshore La Jolla. budgets  have led the research community to conclude that the majority of sediment is captured and transported offshore by Scripps Canyon. However, our data shows that modern sediment accumulation offshore La Jolla may be more complex. The well-defined thickness maximum in the upper acoustically transparent layer, which corresponds to the inter-canyon Holocene depocenter, requires a net influx of sediment to this region since \u223c6-8 ka. Mass balance calculations by  suggested that much of the sediment supplied by longshore drift escaped the littoral cell via Scripps Canyon. Nevertheless, our observations suggest that large amounts of sediment have bypassed Scripps Canyon, despite the narrow pathway between the canyon head and the beach. The large along-shore variation in wave heights observed near Scripps Canyon may be a mechanism for enhanced sediment transport within the surf zone shoreward of the Scripps Canyon head. Thus, we need to reassess the role of the La Jolla Canyon System on sediment accumulation on the inner shelf and evaluate the proportion of sand captured by the canyon versus that shunted southward to the inter-canyon depocenter. Observations of modern sediment accumulation on the San Diego County shelf, which provide a perspective on the regional pattern, confirm that the inner shelf offshore La Jolla, California is generally a depocenter of modern sediments. Regional studies reveal that exposed bedrock is common between the mid-shelf wedge and the beach, except at river mouths . Outside of the two areas of uplift due to the RCFZ, there are no bedrock exposures offshore La Jolla between the mid-shelf wedge and the beach. Our study area appears to be characterized by an atypically large accumulation of young sediment. The westward step of the coastline at the southern extremity of the Oceanside littoral cell may act as a jetty and promote sediment accumulation. The well-developed rip currents consistently observed south of the Scripps Pier at La Jolla Shores beach  and also immediately north of the Scripps Pier  are likely contributing to this net accumulation. These currents redistribute modern sediments seaward on the inter-canyon shelf  and contribute to the formation of the depocenter observed in the isopach maps. Repeated sounding surveys performed between 1949 and 1950  and seismic surveys conducted in 1976 and 1979 with a 3.5 kHz seismic profiler  indicate that sand levels are fairly stable on short time scales (1 to 3 years) at the location where we have identified the upper Holocene depocenter in the inter-canyon shelf. However, both accretion and erosion dynamics have been reported . This would imply that the Holocene sediment depocenter is currently in near equilibrium, with little net influx or outflux over at least the last few decades. A welldefined scour mark due to dredging is observed at 20 m water depth to the north of our study area (see . The preservation of this feature after the dredging occurred indicates that longshore drift is currently limited to the nearshore region. Sediment transport in the littoral cell may be highly episodic with sediment transport occurring during abnormally stormy climatic regimes.\nHigh-resolution three-dimensional coverage of the shelf in the vicinity of the La Jolla and Scripps submarine canyons, obtained from CHIRP seismic and swath bathymetry data, highlights the structural control on the observed stratigraphy and morphology. The faulted and folded tectonic landscape associated with constraining bends in the Rose Canyon Fault Zone plays a critical role in canyon location and morphology as well as in the distribution of modern facies offshore La Jolla, California. In addition to the northward shoaling of the transgressive surface, our high-resolution seismics reveal much crossshore and along-shore structural variability. We observe widespread dip reversals in the bedrock and an increased dip of offshore units compared to those observed onshore. We propose that the observed structural deformation offshore La Jolla is the expression of the compressional component of the transpressional strain regime associated with the RCFZ. We also propose that an antiform controls the location of Scripps Canyon, contrary to the previous hypothesis of fault control. Furthermore, the action of wave-based erosion is reflected in leveling and smoothing of bedrock highs and subsequent infilling of lows with reworked shelf materials. There is also an overall decrease of relief and small-scale roughness in the transgressive surface landward of \u223c25 m water depth due to a decrease in the rate of sea-level rise and longer exposure to wave-base erosion. The detailed bathymetry reveals morphological differences between La Jolla Canyon and Scripps Canyon at various scales, from overall canyon shape to morphology of secondary incisions. The asymmetric development and deep side channels of La Jolla Canyon are indicative of differential erosion due to deformation near the RCFZ. The longitudinal variability of the unconsolidated modern sediment cover on the upper walls of Scripps Canyon appears to result from erosion of shallow gullies by failure processes. Ancient failures or sliding planes within the upper Holocene unit record the evolutionary history of the canyon edges. We identify three stratigraphic sequences overlying the acoustic bedrock offshore La Jolla: 1) estuarine deposits, 2) a healing-phase wedge, and 3) homogeneous sands.

The identification of this depocenter raises questions about the efficiency of Scripps Canyon in capturing sediments and refines our conceptual model for the Holocene sediment transport and deposition offshore La Jolla. Moving shoreward along the inner shelf (< 60 m water depth) the transgressive sequence thins and becomes acoustically transparent, which suggests that the finer-grained material is bypassing the inner shelf and being sequestered on the middle to outer shelf. Despite bathymetric evidence that the highstand systems tract has begun to form along the coast adjacent to river sediment sources, gas wipe out and wave-base reworking obscure seismic evidence for the characteristic downlap."}, {"section_title": "REGIONAL SETTING", "text": "\nThe Eel River forearc basin formed between the accretionary prism overlying the Cascadia subduction zone (CSZ) to the west and the Cascade magmatic arc to the east ( Fig. 4; . Encroachment of the Pacific Plate and the northward migration of the San Andreas Fault have imparted a north-northeast compression across the basin causing major folding and high-angle reverse and thrust faulting along north-northwest trends and reactivation of older north-trending fabrics. This has resulted in a varying pattern of uplift and subsidence along the margin of up to 3 mm/yr . The most prominent sediment sources to the region are the Eel and Mad rivers, which occupy subsiding synclines; the Eel and Freshwater synclines, respectively (Fig.   4). The Eel River, with a drainage basin area of 8640 km 2 , yields ~2232x10 3 kg/km 2 / yr of suspended sediment to the margin, the largest sediment yield to the California margin . Sediment supply is episodic largely in the form of large winter storms, and large amounts of sediment are derived from easily eroded sedimentary and metamorphic rocks. The margin is currently accumulating a thick transgressive sequence and may be transitioning into a highstand geometry offshore of the sediment sources (Hogarth et al., in prep)."}, {"section_title": "Geology", "text": "The Eel River forearc basin began to form in the Neogene between the accretionary prism overlying the Cascadia subduction zone (CSZ) to the west and Cascade magmatic arc to the east ( Fig. 2; . The offshore basin is composed of up to 2.5 km of upper Miocene to Holocene sediments above Franciscan Complex basement rocks (Clarke, 1987;. Several episodes of deformation have occurred across the region since the Paleogene, with the last major episode of deformation occurring in the late Pleistocene. The Pacific ridge first subducted near Los Angeles ~29 ma ago and resulted in the formation of the nascent San Andreas Fault (SAF), which has been migrating north and south in response to the continued subduction. Encroachment of the Pacific Plate and the northward migration of the SAF have imparted a north-northeast compression across the basin causing major folding and high-angle reverse and thrust faulting along north-northwest tends and reactivation of older north-trending fabrics. Since ~500 ka the encroachment of the Mendocino Triple Junction (MTJ), which is the northward propagating end of the SAF, has warped the southern Eel basin (McCrory, 1996) and has produced northeast-oriented shortening of at least 20 mm/yr (Clarke and Carver, 1992). This has resulted in thrust faults onshore , and counter-clockwise rotation of north-south oriented structures to a northwest-southeast orientation. Farther onshore to the east, it appears that strike-slip structures related to the San Andreas Fault and motion between the Pacific and North America plates dominate. In addition, since the early Pleistocene, this plate motion has produced a preceding bulge of uplift and reduction of accommodation up to 80 km north of the triple junction . The area between the regimes onshore and offshore, in the southeast part of the basin, is characterized by transpressive structures. Previous MCS studies have imaged upward branching flower structures, different separations and thicknesses across faults, , and offset of incised channels . The basin is segmented by rising anticlines that are underlain by active thrust faults (Figs. 3 and 4), and the synclines are filled with Middle Pleistocene sediments of the Wildcat Group, which onlap the underlying marine sediments of the Franciscan and Yager Complexes . The northwest folds and faults are clearly imaged in the topography data and rotate from the predominant fabric away from the MTJ (Fig. 2;McLaughlin, 1994;McCrory, 2000;. The folds and faults are also imaged in offshore bathymetry and backscatter data with the Little Salmon Anticline delineating the northern boundary of the large slope failure in the region (Fig. 4). Modern sediment accumulation rates on the shelf vary with maximum accumulation rates an order of magnitude grater than the rates of tectonic deformation inferred from uplifted marine terraces . In the study area at the southeast end of the offshore basin, several structures that appear to be rotated by the encroaching triple junction are oriented nearly perpendicular to shore (Figs. 3 and 4). The three main areas of uplift, from north to south, are the following: 1) Patrick's Point to the Mad River Fault, 2) Eureka Anticline to Table Bluff Anticline, and 3) Centerville Beach to the Russ Fault. The intervening areas of subsidence are: 1) Freshwater Syncline, 2) the Little Salmon Fault, and 3) Eel River Syncline (Figs. 2 and 3;. Vertical rates of motion on these structures ranges from 2.3 mm/yr uplift at Russ Fault to 3 mm/yr subsidence in the Eel River Syncline. Onshore, the Little Salmon Fault (LSF) has been placed either (1) coincident with Table Bluff Anticline   or (2) coincident with the south side of Humboldt Hill Kelsey and Carver, 1988) with the Table Bluff Fault Zone being an active branch of the Little Salmon Fault (McCrory, 2000). Onshore the LSF exhibits dip slip motion (McCrory, 2000;, but offshore in shallow water it appears to be deformed by transpressive tectonics . The slip rate on the LSF ranges from 4.6\u00b12.1 mm/yr estimated offshore (McCrory, 2000) to 6.1\u00b12.3 mm/yr estimated onshore (Clarke & Carver, 1992). Continued deformation along the Eel margin is evidenced by earthquakes, uplifted marine terraces, and subsidence and flooding of peat horizons. Tectonic deformation and recurrence intervals in the Humboldt area were constrained by examining peat sequences in the intertidal areas . Four depositional cycles of abruptly terminated peat overlain by massive muds that gradually graded upward into peats were observed in a 3 m core. The abrupt terminations and gradual regrowth of peat layers is interpreted to result from large earthquakes causing rapid subsidence (~2 m) in the bay and then gradual refilling of the bay over time. Dates of the horizons indicate a recurrence interval for these large earthquakes of 700-1000 years . Clarke and Carver also found evidence for late Holocene paleoseismicity on the LSF and in the Mad River Fault Zone (1992). They examined fault displacements and several other indicators such as driftwood and fossil mollusk shells on raised land and submerged and buried marshes and forests."}, {"section_title": "They concluded that movements on the Little Salmon Fault and the Mad River Fault", "text": "Zone were associated with events on the CSZ megathrust, and future events could be up to Mw=9.5 (Clarke and Carver, 1992)."}, {"section_title": "Modern Hydrodynamics and Sediment Dispersal", "text": "The Eel River, located in the south of the study area, has a relatively small drainage basin area of 8640 km 2 and steep headwater terrain up to ~2000 m in elevation . It is the largest sediment source to the California margin, yielding ~2232x10 3 kg/km 2 /yr of suspended sediment to the coast, while the smaller Mad River (1290 km 2 ) to the north has a comparably large sediment yield of ~2070x10 3 kg/km 2 /yr . Both rivers occupy subsiding synclines; the Eel River in the Eel River Syncline and the Mad River in the Freshwater Syncline (Fig. 3). Easily erodable sedimentary and metamorphic rocks such as weakly lithified siltstone and mudstone of the Eel River Basin supply the shelf with a total suspended sediment (TSS) load of 10-30 Mt/yr of silt and clay (Syvitski and Morehead, 1999), with ~25% of the river's TSS as fine sands (Sommerfield and Nittrouer, 1999), and bedload is estimated to be ~10-20% of TSS (Brown and Ritter, 1971). The Eel River is a stormdominated system with over 90% of its annual runoff occurring between November and May (Sommerfield and Nittrouer, 1999). Large sediment discharge events are often coincident with energetic ocean conditions that act to redistribute previous flood deposits and transport ~80% of the silt and clay alongshore to the ends of the shelf and beyond the outer shelf (Sommerfield and Nittrouer, 1999;Wheatcroft et al., 1997) beds, stratification is preserved on the central shelf, but seaward of the 75 m isobath, stratification is not preserved (Sommerfield and Nittrouer, 1999;. Over a 100-yr sediment record, maximum deposition occurred on the mid-shelf centered on the 70-m isobath (Sommerfield and Nittrouer, 1999)."}, {"section_title": "Major Structures and Features", "text": "An angular unconformity is imaged throughout the study area (Figs. 5, 6 and 7). However, this surface is not mapped at depths deeper than ~30 m below the seafloor in the southern half of the data set where gas limits acoustic penetration. The angular unconformity is interpreted to be the transgressive surface formed during the sea level rise following the last deglaciation (~21 ka-present) as it truncates underlying bedding, has relatively high acoustic reflectivity, and overlying sediments onlap the surface progressively landward. The surface exhibits much variability in roughness and acoustic character, being smooth with high acoustic amplitude in most areas, but rough with variable acoustic amplitude in other regions. For example, the surface is quite rough ~40 m water depth adjacent to the Mad River. Still other areas are obscured by gas, such as above a prominent anticline (Fig. 6). Deposition above the surface ranges from acoustically transparent, to distinctly laminated or irregular. Deposits below are also variable, transparent to highly reflective, with wide, channel-like surfaces, anticline structures, and laminations. The overall topography of the transgressive surface in the northern half of the study area is marked by a broad high extending ~10-15 km along strike, adjacent to the Mad River Fault, the Freshwater Syncline, and the Eureka Anticline onshore (Fig. 2). In the northernmost dip lines, T and V, the surface is covered by ~4 m of sediment at 30 m water depth (Fig. 5A). Farther south, however, sediment cover decreases to a minimum of ~2 m over a prominent fault and anticline (Fig. 5B). The anticline and fault are well imaged in several lines (Fig. 6B), but are obscured by gas in other lines (Figs. 6A and 6C). In strike line 15N, the angular unconformity surface is visibly offset ~0.5 m across this structure (Fig. 7). To the south of the fault the transgressive surface deepens and is covered with over 30 m of sediment (Fig. 6). A structure contour map of the transgressive surface shows that the trend of the distinct southern edge of the structural high is coincident with the projection of the northern branch of the Little Salmon Fault onshore, which coincides with the Humboldt Hill Anticline (HHA), and as such we will refer to this entire suite of faults as the Little Salmon Fault Complex (LSF complex; Fig. 8). The fault/fold anticline within the structural high coincides with the Eureka Anticline onshore. The LSF complex delineates the topographic high in the north from the structural low in the south and is outlined by the eastward deflection of the 60 m contour (Fig. 8). Within the southern low, we observe a local high adjacent to the Table Bluff Anticline (Fig. 8A). Vibracores along the LSF structural high penetrated the angular unconformity surface (Q45; Figs. 9 and 10). Sediments recovered in core Q45 sampled the transgressive surface, which separated a layer of coarse-grained, rounded pebbles and cobbles overlying fine-grained deposits with a sharp erosive contact between the two units (Fig. 9)."}, {"section_title": "Sequence I", "text": "Above the regional unconformity that we interpret as the transgressive surface, we identify two distinct acoustic units. The lower unit, Sequence I, mantles the angular unconformity and is characterized by chaotic to transparent reflectors that appear to coincide with the rough areas of the transgressive surface ( Figs. 5 and 8). The transgressive surface in regions coincident with Sequence I exhibits more roughness than in areas lacking Sequence I. The shoreward limit of Sequence I is defined by a prominent surface of onlap with shoreward terminations (Fig. 5). Sequence I is most distinct in dip lines between ~60 and 100 m water depth and at shallower depths in strike lines to the south and north of the Eureka Anticline (Figs. 6, 7, 10). Across the margin, the unit thickens from zero meters to a maximum of ~8 m at ~90 m water depth and then continues to thin offshore (Fig. 11A). In northern dip lines, such as line T, there are a few reflectors within Sequence I that dip less steeply than the transgressive surface (Fig. 5A). In the southern dip lines, such as Line 4p , Sequence I is thicker and the acoustic character of the sediments is more chaotic with concave-up, closely spaced, and truncated reflectors that decrease in number seaward and eventually fade to two subparallel reflectors (Figs. 5B and 10). In strike, the unit appears to infill lows, pinching out near the Eureka Anticline (Figs. 6 and 10). For example, in several strike lines to the north of the Eureka Anticline Sequence I infills a broad low ~5 m deep and extending ~2-3 km (Fig. 6). In strike lines, the onlap surface that forms the upper boundary of Sequence I is smooth with high-amplitude acoustic character (Fig. 6). The southern extent of Sequence I is difficult to discern as gas obscures the subsurface reflectors. An isopach map of Sequence I shows that it is thin to absent over the structural high, it has a maximum thickness in the water depth range of 60-100 m, and its distribution has linear trends parallel to the contours ( Figure 10A). Its maximum thickness of ~8 m is located to the southwest of the structural high (Fig. 10A), which coincides with an embayment delineated by the 100 m contour on the structural contour map for the transgressive surface (Fig. 8A). Note there is very little structural control associated with the Freshwater Syncline (FS) on either the depth to the transgressive surface (Fig.  8A) or on the sediment thickness of Sequence I (Fig. 11A). In fact, the largest control on both sediment thickness and depth to the transgressive surface appears to be the southern boundary of the LSF complex that separates a broad high to the north from a structural low to the south (Fig. 8) "}, {"section_title": "Sequence II", "text": "Sequence II is observed throughout the study area above Sequence I and the transgressive surface, but its acoustic character is highly variable along and across the margin. At deep water depths (> 60 m) there are several parallel, high-amplitude reflectors in Sequence II (Figs. 6,7,and 10). Nearshore areas are characterized by transparent sediment, and some regions are obscured by high-amplitude reflections indicative of gas or fluid in the sediment (e.g., Fig. 5A). Still other areas of Sequence II have a blotchy acoustic character (e.g., Fig. 6). In line V, the northernmost dip line, which is located offshore of the modern Mad River, Sequence II sediments are relatively thick, onlap Sequence I, and thin progressively shoreward and seaward. Immediately to the south, in line T, the thickness of sediment overlying the transgressive surface appears to be consistent until ~60 m water depth at which point the sediments begin to thicken seaward to a maximum thickness at ~80-90 m water depth (Figs. 5A and 10). In the nearshore, the unit is acoustically transparent, but displays distinct acoustic laminations moving seaward towards the middle to outer shelf (> 50 m water depth). Even though Sequence II thins seaward from the 80 m depocenter there is no observed downlap or shoreward migration of the downlap position in this region of the shelf. Rather, the reflectors appear to terminate at the seafloor by truncation (Figs. 5 and   10). The acoustic reflectivity of the transgressive surface increases coincident with the increase in reflectivity of the overlying layers. Farther south, Lines R and Q exhibit very thin sediment cover (~1 m) to ~60 m water depth at which point the sediment thickness increases seaward to a maximum again at ~80-90 m water depth, beyond which, sediment thickness decreases relatively rapidly (Fig. 10). The acoustic character of the transgressive surface and overlying sequence in the southern dip lines displays the same characteristics observed in the northern lines, that is, large lateral variability in acoustic amplitude of the transgressive surface and variation from acoustically well-laminated reflectors along the outer and mid-shelf to acoustically transparent on the inner shelf (e.g., Line 4p, Fig. 5B). The deformation within the fault complex can be observed as line 4p crosses the fold/fault axis very obliquely (Fig. 5B). Line O is located along the southern limb of the Eureka Anticline (Figure 4). To the south, Sequence II thickness continues to increase systematically towards the Eel River Syncline, but the maximum thickness is not imaged due to the occurrence of gas that obscures reflectors from the underlying surfaces (Fig. 10). Along strike Sequence II exhibits as much variability as there is observed across the margin; it is thin over the northern structural high and thickens into the Eel River Syncline (Fig. 11B). The high amplitude horizons in Sequence II onlap the inclined transgressive surface as it deepens into the Eel River Syncline. The onlapping reflectors exhibit divergence and their dip systematically increases with depth to the south (Fig.   12). The mid-shelf thickness maximum of Sequence II observed in dip lines between 80 and 90 m water depth is delineated in an isopach map of the sequence (Fig. 11B) and is also revealed by the entire thickness of the transgressive deposit (i.e., Sequences I and II, Fig. 11C). Although the structure map of the transgressive surface shows little variation to the north of the LSF complex (Fig. 8A), sediments over the transgressive surface thicken gradually from ~1-2 m to ~5 m over a distance of ~10 km towards the Mad River Delta at water depths shallower than 60 m (Fig. 11B). The isopach map also shows the northeast margin of a sediment depocenter located to the south of the LSF complex and the pronounced eastward jog in the depocenter (Fig. 11). Within the area adjacent to the Eel River Syncline, where the transgressive surface is locally high directly offshore of the Table Bluff Anticline, a sediment thickness minimum is observed (Fig. 11B). As shown in the isopach map of Sequence II, sediments are thinnest over the structural highs and thickest in the lows. In summary, the CHIRP data show that the late Pleistocene and Holocene succession on the Eel shelf is a seaward-and landward-thinning unit bounded by the transgressive surface and the sea floor (Figs. 5,6,and 10). Sequence II onlaps on to the basal sequence (Sequence I) and the onlap position migrates landward through time, a stratal geometry characteristic of the transgressive systems tract. Across the shelf, this succession ranges from a few meters thick at the shelf break to almost 25 m thick near the middle to outer shelf depocenter to less that 5 m at the 25 m isobath. The folded and faulted strata beneath the transgressive surface are truncated as a result of wavebase erosion associate with the last sea-level rise. Along the shelf, the thickness of the transgressive systems tract exhibits marked variability, being thickest in the subsiding synclines (30+ m thickness), and thinning to less than 2 m across the axis of the Eureka Anticline (Figs. 5 and 6). The upper surface of the Holocene deposits slopes smoothly seaward and is poorly correlated with the relief on the underlying transgressive surface."}, {"section_title": "Evolution of the Transgressive Sequence", "text": "Seismic records show that the Holocene transgressive succession on the Eel Margin is a seaward and landward thinning unit defined by an underlying surface of erosion, or the transgressive surface, and the overlying seafloor. The transgressive sequence is further divided into two distinct units. We interpret Sequence I, which is bounded by the transgressive surface below and by a flooding surface characterized by backstepping, onlapping reflectors above, as a transgressive healing-phase deposit. Our interpretation of this unit is based on its aerial and stratigraphic location as well as its acoustic character and geometry. Sequence I is thickest in water depths > 60 m, with the thickest deposition following roughly shore-parallel trends to the west of the structural high that is bounded on its southern edge by the LSF complex (Fig. 11A). In seismic profiles, this distribution is related to low areas in the transgressive surface (Figs. 5 and 6). We propose that these low areas correspond with periods of slow sea-level rise during the early deglaciation (~21-15 ka; e.g., . For example, we observe one broad low between ~100 and 80 m water depth that could be a terrace carved when sea level was rising slowly (21-15ka; Figs. 6 and 8A). The resultant wave-cut terraces provide a change in relief from less steep where wave-base erosion occurred to more steep above the region of erosion (e.g., Hart and Plint, 1993). At the onset of meltwater pulse 1A (~15ka), sea-level began to rise rapidly to ~60 m water depth. Seaward of these depths, we observe the most roughness on the transgressive surface, which would be predicted if wave-based erosion had little to no time to erode and rework the surface. Sediment eroded from the shoreface subsequently located at <~60 m infilled, or \"healed,\" the lows in the transgressive surface in the lower shoreface and on the shelf . The thin veneer of coarse-grained, rounded pebbles and cobbles sampled above the transgressive surface in core Q45 reflects a high energy environment and the coarse-grained sediment lag that would be deposited (Fig. 9). The upper boundary of Sequence I is defined by the surface of onlapping marine horizons. Traditionally, the transgressive surface is identified by a progressive shoreward shift of facies (Christie-Blick and , seen here as onlapping horizons. This is the case at shallow water depths where Sequence I is absent, however, the onlapping surface diverges from the wave ravinement surface at depth and in structural lows near shore (Fig. 10). Spinelli and Field (2003) interpret what we have labeled Sequence I as \"transgressive coastal deposits\" deposited by the Mad River prior to or early in the transgression. They have identified the lower bounding surface of this sequence as a lowstand erosion surface, or sequence boundary, and the upper, onlap surface as the transgressive surface (see their Figs. 3 and 4). In their scenario, because the unit is bounded by the sequence boundary and the transgressive surface, it must be a lowstand unit. We agree with Spinelli and Field (2003), that Sequence I is a transgressive deposit, but we propose it is a healing-phase deposit formed by wave-base erosion and is sequestered in structural lows along the transgressive surface. In near shore regions, shallower than those mapped by Spinelli and Field (2003), we imaged a channelized erosion surface truncated by the transgressive surface ( Figs. 5A and 10). This erosion surface is directly under Sequences I and II, and we interpret it as a lowstand erosion surface. The intervening sediment unit exhibits broad distributary style channel incisions and thick laminations. The distributary nature of the channels, however, suggests that the surface may not be the sequence boundary. One scenario that could lead to the observed geometry is that the preexisting physiography of the shelf or timing of erosion at the shelf edge facilitated deposition in the nearshore and erosion or nondeposition farther offshore. Recent research has shown that erosion during the lowstand may not occur until sea level falls below the shelf edge (e.g., ). This could result in sediment deposition on the shelf during early lowstand and subsequent erosion of the shelf edge and adjacent shelf during the late lowstand (i.e., Stage 2maximum sea-level fall). During transgression, wave base erosion could cannibalize thin deposits near the middle to outer shelf, and the transgressive surface might coalesce with the underlying sequence boundary formed near the shelf edge, but not on the inner shelf where thicker deposits overlying the sequence boundary are observed. It is possible that the sediments of Sequence I are estuarine in nature and were deposited during early sea-level rise, but their occasional chaotic character implies a reworked nature, such as one would predict for coarse sediment shunted offshore during shoreface erosion or, perhaps in reworked estuarine deposits. Such a scenario explains the distribution of Sequence I infilling the lows along the transgressive surface and the observation that the transgressive surface and the onlap surface coalesce landward (Fig. 5), except in lows (Fig. 6). Spinelli and Field (2003) invoke a change in sediment source during the transgression to explain the observed geometry; the \"transgressive coastal\" deposits are purported to be sourced from the Mad River with the overlying acoustically welllaminated onlapping sequences being sourced from the Eel River. In their Fig. 5, they show that the sediment thickness of this unit (\"transgressive coastal deposits\" -Spinelli and Field, 2003) changes across the Freshwater Syncline with a maximum thickness on the northern limb of the Freshwater Syncline. Furthermore, they report that the thickness of this unit is approximately 2-3 meters across much of the shelf with maximum thickness of 8 m off the axis of a syncline directly offshore from the present location of the Mad River, which led them to believe the sediment was sourced from the Mad River (Spinelli and Field, 2003). It is difficult to understand why \"transgressive coastal deposits\" sourced from the Mad River would be preferentially deposited on one limb of a syncline. Furthermore, based on the CHIRP seismics, the Freshwater Syncline appears to exert no influence on the thickness or distribution of Sequence I (Fig. 8). Our results show that Sequence I infills other structural lows, the depocenter is predominantly shore parallel, and it cuts across the trend of the Freshwater Syncline suggesting that deformation associated with the syncline was inactive at this time. The isopach map shows that Sequence I is located at the edges of the structural high delineated on its southern edge by the LSF complex (Fig. 11). Based on the observed erosion and non-deposition, it appears that the Eureka Anticline and adjacent shoal was a structural high throughout the last sealevel rise. Sequence I might be eroded off the Eureka Anticline because of subsequent uplift and deformation in the region (Figs. 6, 7 and 10). At lower stands of sea level, given the geometry of the Eureka Anticline and adjacent region, the shoreline would have taken an abrupt eastward jog along its south termination (Figs. 8 and 11). Thus, as sea level transgressed across this shoreline, healing-phase deposits would have been shunted both to the south and west of the high, consistent with our observations (Fig. 8). Sequence II is a unit of onlapping, backstepping sediments characteristic of the transgressive systems tract. Based on their flat, laminated nature in the cross shelf direction and core samples, we interpret Sequence II as formed by deposition along an open shelf. Along strike, Sequence II shows marked divergence in the Eel River Syncline with the dip of each reflector increasing with depth ( Fig. 12). As mentioned above, the thickness variations of Sequence II are as large along the margin as they are across the margin (Fig. 11); the thickness ranges from > 30 m in the subsiding Eel River Syncline to < 2 m across the axis of the Eureka Anticline. Fig. 10 illustrates the threedimensional onlap pattern of Sequence II, onlapping Sequence I and the transgressive surface to the east and the limb of the Eel River Syncline to the north. The thickness of this deposit led  to assign it to the highstand systems tract. Nevertheless, the depositional systems tracts are defined primarily by their architecture and facies associations . A transgressive systems tract is composed of backstepping beds, which terminate landward by onlap and seaward by downlap. The highstand systems tract is composed of offlapping beds with dowlapping seaward terminations that evolves from aggradational to progradational in response to available accommodation. The surface between the two tracts, known as the maximum flooding surface (Swift et al., 1991), separates discordant sets of bedding planes. By these criteria, the bulk of the deposits above the transgressive surface on the Eel shelf must be assigned to the transgressive systems tract. There is, however, some geomorphic evidence of incipient highstand. A coastal plain has developed since the late Holocene reduction in the rate of sea-level rise, and the Mad and Eel estuaries of 5000 ybp have inverted as deltas have filled these synclinal axes and have prograded down their length. Based on sediment thickness, distribution, and acoustic character (Figs. 5, 6 and 10), it appears that the ephemeral near shore deposits are reworked and transported offshore and are sequestered on the middle to outer shelf. On the inner shelf, the transparent acoustic character of the transgressive sequence and numerous cores suggest the inner shelf is composed of homogenous sands with little to no acoustic impedance contrasts. Moving offshore, the thickness of the transgressive sequence exhibits a marked increase in concert with an increase in acoustic laminations (Figs. 5 and 10). These observations suggest that the flood deposits emplaced on the inner shelf are subsequently reworked and sequestered offshore in deeper water or along strike in the actively subsiding synclines (e.g., Eel River syncline)."}, {"section_title": "Tectonic Controls on Sedimentation", "text": "The thickness of the transgressive sequence is predominantly controlled by the along-shore tectonic deformation and folding in the region (Figs. 2 and 10). Sediment is eroded from shoals and deposited in lows where expanded sections are observed. This pattern represents the long-term sediment accumulation controlled by tectonic accommodation. As few of the cores acquired during STRATAFORM penetrated the transgressive surface, we have examined the stratal patterns and onshore paleoseismic work to place some constraints on the relative timing of deformation (e.g., Fig. 3). For example, the offset of the transgressive surface over the Eureka Anticline indicates deformation has taken place since sea level transgressed that water depth (~50 m). Assuming wave-based erosion reworked the shoreface and subsequent deformation offset the planar surface, deformation on the Eureka Anticline has occurred since ~10 ka. Activity on the Eureka Anticline agrees with mid-Pleistocene to Holocene activity inferred by other researchers (Clarke and Carver, 1992;McCrory, 2000). In addition, the high sediment input to the margin provides a high fidelity record of the deformation, such as the diverging, highly reflective horizons within Sequence II (Figs. 6 and 12). The divergence of bedding with increasing distance away from the LSF complex records the rapid subsidence in the Eel River syncline of up to 3 mm/yr (Fig. 3). Uplift rates onshore for the LSF complex are significantly lower than subsidence of the Eel River syncline, and reflectors in the upper sediment unit do not appear to diverge seaward to the west of the anticline (Figs. 5 and 10). The divergent geometry of the reflectors in the Eel River Syncline indicates deformation and deposition have been synchronous rather than deformation predating deposition (Fig. 12). The geometry of the reflectors indicates syntectonic deposition (Fig. 13A). It is possible that deformation has been continuous, but based on previous researchers' observations of episodic events on the LSF (e.g., Clarke and Carver, 1992; it is more likely that deformation offshore has also been episodic. The high-amplitude reflectors in Sequence II, which are interpreted to represent time horizons, may not occur with high enough frequency to determine whether deformation is continuous (Fig. 13A) or episodic (Fig. 13B). The thickness of Sequence II sediments in line 10 represents ~1.3 mm/yr of deformation assuming an age of 10 ka for the transgressive surface in that location (Fig.   12). This rate of deformation at the northern side of the Eel River Syncline is likely a low estimate for the maximum rate in the syncline and is comparable to the maximum of 3 mm/yr observed onshore ( Fig. 3;  . Long cores are needed to provide more insight into the nature of the deformation. We predict that continuous deformation and sedimentation would result in very little grain-size change throughout the core (Fig. 13A), but episodic deformation, which would create sudden deepening, would result in a pattern of recurrent, coarsening upward units (Fig. 13B). Alternatively, flat-lying geometry and an overall coarsening upward package would be observed if deformation preceded deposition (Fig. 13C). Unfortunately cores from the STRATAFORM project did not sample deeper than ~3 m below the seafloor on the shelf and thus were inadequate to define the grain size patterns or date the highly reflective horizons observed on the margin (Fig. 10). Spinelli and Field (2003) claim a structural control for the location of the sediments mapped here as Sequence I. This claim is based on a rough coincidence of their Sequence I depocenter with location of the Freshwater Syncline as mapped by . Evidence from  shows that the Freshwater Syncline has likely been inactive since ~500ka and that the youngest units within it are generally flat-lying. Seismic profiles from this study also find little evidence for a syncline in the vicinity of the mapped Freshwater Syncline, nor in the location of the mapped Sequence I sediments. In addition, the sediment depocenter mapped by Spinelli and Field (2003) is confined to the northern side of the mapped Freshwater Syncline, not infilling a distinct low. The finer scale mapping of Sequence I facilitated by this study indicates that the unit is contour parallel and is thickest offshore of the high associated with the LSF complex and, if anything thickens to the south. However, due to gas it is difficult to determine with confidence how far it extends to the south. If these sediments are in fact estuarine sediments deposited during the late lowstand to early transgression prior to the sea-level incursion, it is unclear how the Mad River derived sediments could surmount this longstanding topographic high and deposit sediments to the south. Spinelli and Field (2003) propose that the Mad River must have migrated to the north over time, but this appears unlikely given the structural impediment formed by the Eureka Anticline and LSF complex (Fig. 8)."}, {"section_title": "Sediment Source and Hydrodynamic Control on Sediment Distribution", "text": "On shorter time scales, hydrodynamic forcing likely plays a role in generating the mid-shelf sediment thickness high, and the rivers as sediment sources enhance sediment thickness on the adjacent shelf. The mid-shelf wedge visible between ~75 and 90 m of water depth in the Eel River Basin is likely the result of hydrodynamic conditions such as wave climate and the currents that carry Eel River storm sediments to the north (e.g., Sommerfield and Nittrouer, 1999;. As expected with slowing sea-level rise and high sediment input, accommodation has been filled or exceeded on the shelf adjacent to the Mad and Eel Rivers where sediment thickness increases above the thickness observed on the intervening structural high. Although, sediment thickness in the Eel River Syncline is largely due to the tectonic low, bathymetry and strike lines that parallel the shoreline show that there is excess sediment accumulation as part of a subaqueous delta, and it has deflected the 40 m isobath seaward in front of the Eel River mouth (Fig. 2). This observation is consistent with bathymetric observations from Goff et al. (1999). A similar observation appears to hold offshore of the Mad River, but our survey coverage did not extend far enough north to adequately document this trend. The superimposition of the sediment source on the tectonic basin results in enhanced sediment thickness and bathymetry, and thus the seafloor is poorly correlated with the relief on the underlying transgressive surface (Figs. 2 and 8). Highly reflective layers within Sequence II are likely due to storm events that have carried large amounts of sediment to the shelf. These storm layers would have finer sediment grain sizes than the sediment layers deposited during normal conditions. Shallow lines also appear to have more mottled, highly reflective sediments in the near surface. This could be due to a higher concentration of gas at shallower depths. The location of the depocenter on the outer shelf at 80 -90 m water depth is deeper than the water depth of the depocenter (~70 m) observed by studies of sediments deposition on time scales of 100s of years (Sommerfield & Nittrouer, 1999). The shoreward offset is most likely temporal, and with continued exposure to storm activity and reworking the short-term depocenter will eventually be transported offshore."}, {"section_title": "ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS", "text": "This project was funded by ONR as part of the STRATAFORM initiative.

In a simple model with sea-level fall below the shelf edge being limited, the early lowstand shoreline would remain on the shelf and aggrade, with minor incision as sea-level falls below the shelf edge. Slope deposits will be minor or removed by reworking. In this case, sediments thicken seaward contrary to observations offshore of the Mad River.  "}, {"section_title": "Fluvial Accommodation During Sea-level Lowstand", "text": "CHIRP seismic data from the Eel River Margin show little evidence of incised channels formed during the last sea-level lowstand. We do, however, map a surface that we interpret as an erosional surface formed during the last sea-level fall. As such, this surface might be the sequence boundary, but the absence of significant acoustic penetration beneath this surface leaves the possibility that a deeper erosional surface exist (i.e., the sequence boundary). The timing of this deposition must have been during the last sea-level fall (~120ka-20ka), during the LGM (~20 ka), or during early sea-level rise (Fig. 12). Although the sediment deposited above the presumed sequence boundary is located offshore of the Mad River, onshore it is not distinctly confined to the river mouth, but has a large along-shore extent. Furthermore, the geometries of this lowstand erosive surface and the overlying sediments suggest that the channels are distributary in nature associated with widespread deposition at this time. The seaward-thinning geometry of the unit is unexpected, if we assume a model of lowstand shoreline incision (e.g., Fig. 3B). According to Posamentier et al. (1992) during a forced regression (due to RSL fall), one would expect that the sequence boundary and transgressive surface would coalesce landward of the lowstand shoreline pinch-out and divergence seaward of this point (Fig. 3B). On the Eel Margin we see the opposite geometry; the two surfaces coalesce seaward and diverge landward (Figs. 6 and 10). These observations suggest a different mechanism than simple lowstand shoreline deposition on the shelf. The grain size, sulfide odor, and root structures present in the core collected in the unit indicate a subaerial depositional environment. This could indicate estuarine deposition during early sea-level rise. Unfortunately, whether or not they were deposited during sea-level fall or during the early sea-level rise is unclear without a better chronostraphic framework from cores. The presence of this seaward-thinning wedge of sediment, however, implies there was accommodation on the shelf during sea-level lowstand, a time often characterized by bypass or channel incision and downcutting. It is clear from observations across a variety of fluvial and marine settings that the response of a system to base-level fall varies depending on numerous factors (e.g., . Several mechanisms could explain the unexpected observation of lowstand accommodation offshore of the Mad River: 1) the physiography of the margin is such that as sea level falls, the newly exposed shelf has a slope less than the updip fluvial system; 2) the last sea-level lowstand did not descend below the shelf edge or only for a short duration that was insufficient to induce erosion at the shelf edge and subsequent retrogressive channel incision; 3) the high subsidence rate of the river valley creates accommodation despite sealevel fall; and/or 4) the response time of the fluvial system, which has a markedly high sediment load, allows a large amount of aggradation on the shelf. It is not apparent, however, from the sequence architecture or initial considerations of the shelf physiography what factor(s) led to aggradation on the shelf. Preliminary measurements of the slopes of the coastal fluvial system and the sequence boundary (both ~0.2\u02da) show little difference in slope between the two surfaces. Depending on the characteristics of the fluvial system, a small change could lead to a simple reduction in channel sinuosity to increase the channel slope to that of the original channel, rather than aggradation to a new equilibrium . Furthermore, offshore of the Mad River, the depth of modern shelf edge (estimated at the point of maximum curvature) is below that of sea level during the LGM (-130 to -120 m; Fig.  12). It would follow from the work of Tornqvist and others (2006) that this setting would be less likely to experience channel incision across the shelf that transports sediment to the shelf edge. Although the effects of isostatic rebound and regional tectonic forces have not been taken into account, the proximity of the shelf edge depth to the LGM sea level indicates that if sea level did fall below the shelf edge, it is unlikely that it stayed there for period long enough to induce cross-shelf incision. In a model based on sequence stratigraphic concepts (e.g., Figs. 1 and 3A), a RSL fall could lead to distributary channels and deposition on the shelf until sea level falls below the shelf edge ( Fig. 13A and B). Headward erosion of the shelf edge could create limited incision, oceanic conditions could rework the small amount of sediment deposited on the slope, and subsequent transgression might rework those sediments deposited on the shelf (Fig.   13C and D). However, the geometry of such a deposit would likely thin landward and seaward if exposed to sufficient reworking during transgression (Fig. 13E). This does not fully explain our observations that the lowstand deposit on the Eel Margin thins markedly seaward, requiring another mechanism. The highly active tectonic nature of the Eel Margin may create accommodation on the shelf during sea-level lowstand; the Mad River occupies the Freshwater Syncline, which is subsiding up to 1 mm/yr onshore . This rate is very close to the rate expected for sea-level fall averaged over the last glaciation (120 m / 100 kyr = 1.2 mm/ yr), which implies little to no creation of new accommodation due to subsidence as sea level fell. However, sea level fell in a nonlinear manner, with occasional meltwater pulses (Fig. 12), which could have led to periods of time where accommodation was created to allow sediment aggradation. CHIRP data, however, show little evidence that the offshore section of the Freshwater Syncline has undergone deformation during the Holocene transgression (Hogarth et al., in prep). Furthermore, based on multi-channel seismic data,  reported that deformation and differential subsidence across the offshore Freshwater Syncline ceased at ~600 ka. The large sediment supply to the region could also explain lowstand aggradation on the shelf. The sediment supply could increase the fluvial system's response time to perturbations and result in widespread aggradation, as suggested by the model of . Ultimately, the presence of the lowstand sediment could be explained by a combination of several of the above factors. Additional data to constrain the northern extent of the lowstand sediment unit and long cores to establish age constraints are needed. It is likely that structural features confined the river drainages during sea-level lowstand, which explains the localization of sediments offshore of the Mad River. It is possible that similar deposits are present offshore of the Eel River to the south. However, the acoustic wipeout due to gas in seismic images prevents our imaging to that depth. We expect that the lowstand sediment deposition in this area would be limited by the morphology of the margin as the shelf-slope break is at a shallower depth than offshore of the Mad River, the shelf edge is closer to shore, and the Eel Canyon dissects the shelf. The Eel River Syncline, however, has been subsiding at a much more rapid rate (~3 mm/ yr) than the Freshwater Syncline (~1-0 mm/yr), which may create accommodation during the sea-level fall."}, {"section_title": "Implications for Fluvial Morphodynamics and Global Sediment Budget", "text": "In recent years, researchers have recognized the importance of small, mountainous rivers in the supply of sediment to the global ocean (e.g., Milliman and Syvitski, 1992). This focus, however, has been based on modern sediment discharge. Evidence from this study implies that fluvial sediment was sequestered on the inner shelf rather than transported offshore to the slope or basin during the last sea-level lowstand on the Eel Margin. This observation suggests that similar small, high-gradient rivers may behave differently than low gradient rivers during RSL fall and lowstand. We propose a revised model of global sediment supply that takes into account changes in sediment discharge throughout a sea-level cycle. Although they can have large sediment discharges, low gradient, passive margin river systems (Type 1) often sequester large amounts of sediment in their coastal plains during highstand. Conversely, high gradient, active margin rivers (Type 2) rivers generally have little onshore storage capacity during highstand. These small, mountainous catchments may dominate during highstand (Milliman, 1992), but may be subordinate to Type 1 rivers during lowstand conditions (Fig. 14). Massive submarine fans are associated with many Type 1 rivers ( Fig. 14) and are, in large part, deposited during RSL fall when incised channels reactivate onshore distributary networks with large storage capacities. We predict that sediment yield to the margin from Type 2 rivers will exhibit much less variability than that from Type 1 rivers throughout a sea-level cycle as any channel incision will mobilize little sediment from onshore (Fig. 12). The reactivation of distributary channel networks onshore by channel incision on the shelf near Type 1 rivers can potentially deliver huge amounts of stored sediment during short time spans during the lowstand. This may explain the difference in Gulf of Mexico Rivers (e.g., Anderson et al., 2005; Vail-type sequence stratigraphic model;  with large lowstand deposits due to incised channels reactivating large volumes of sediment in distributary channels versus Northern California Rivers (e.g., Eel River) that have less lowstand deposition offshore because minimal onshore storage (steep, narrow rivers with minimal coastal plain) provides little sediment to the slope. Previous researchers have explored the importance of factors other than sealevel fall and rate of fall in governing sediment discharge to the oceans, but have not differentiated between river storage capacities. In their discussion of the evolution of world rivers with sea-level fall, Mulder and Syvitski (1996) imply that, in terms of deposition and erosion, on a worldwide scale, Type 2 rivers would yield more sediment than during today's highstand, but they limit their insight to change in basin area and slope with sea-level fall. Therefore, they conclude that narrow shelves seaward of Type 2 rivers would cause more incision and downcutting than would be experienced by Type 1 rivers adjacent to broad continental shelves. Recent work by  demonstrated that shelf width was indeed a primary control on sediment transport to the deep ocean in the California borderlands where rivers are Type 2 in nature. Comparing sediment volume fluctuations from submarine canyon systems during sea-level changes of the late Quaternary (~58 ka-present), they found that channels and submarine canyons on a wide shelf were connected during lowstand, but disconnected during highstand. Conversely, on the narrow shelf near La Jolla the proximity of the La Jolla submarine canyon to shore results in its capture and offshore transport of a majority of the sediment in the system during sea-level highstands. The estimates of highstand deposition rates on the La Jolla submarine fan by Inman (historical;2008) and Covault et al. (13 kapresent;, however, are nearly equal to the combined lowstand deposition rates of the Oceanside and Carlsbad fans, which were active during lowstand. Thus, in southern California the shelf width appears to have played little role in the total amount of sediment liberated to the deep sea throughout the sea-level cycle. We propose that the most important factor leading to a contrast in sediment discharge during lowstand may be the different highstand storage capacities of basins. Studies in Lake Powell have shown that periods of lowstand, even though marked by decreased water discharge, exhibited increased occurrence of hyperpycnal flows (Pratson et al., 2009). Although they expected water discharge and the frequency of hyperpycnal flows to be proportional, researchers observed that sediment was easily eroded from unconsolidated delta topsets exposed by lake-level fall (Pratson et al., 2009). Presumably, the same phenomenon would occur in a marine setting: sea-level fall would result in rapid incision into unconsolidated delta and river sediment. On a margin with little onshore sediment storage, incision and re-excavating of filled channels during sea-level fall would be limited. An example where we would expect to see markedly different behavior throughout the sea-level cycle is the rivers of Papua New Guinea. Milliman (1995) observed that high mountain (> 3000 m headwater elevation) rivers, such as the Fly and Purari of Papua New Guinea, had significantly higher sediment discharges than coastal plain rivers of the island. However, although both the Fly and Purari Rivers have headwaters in the high mountains, the Fly River crosses a large coastal plain before reaching the ocean (Fig. 15). Observations on the shelf indicate there is little modern sediment yield from the Fly River (Slingerland et al., 2008). We expect, however, that the ample sediment stored in its coastal plain can be remobilized during sea-level fall. Furthermore, Milliman (1995) noted that the nearby oceanic trench is filled and buried by sediment likely sourced from these rivers. We predict that sediment filling the trench is largely sourced from the Fly River during sea-level lowstand. These two rivers, with similar climate, headwater elevation, and sea-level history, would provide an ideal setting to test the hypothesis put forth here. If correct, this modifies the hypothesis that Type 2 rivers provide more sediment to the ocean when normalized for drainage area (Milliman, 1995;Milliman, 1997). During highstands this is correct because they have little to no onshore storage ( Fig. 12; Milliman, 1995). During sea-level falls, however, where the shelf edge is exposed and retrogressive erosion (upstream nick point migration) reactivates the onshore storage, Type 1 rivers supply a disproportionate amount of sediment to the ocean (Fig. 12). Type 2 rivers supply roughly the same amount to the ocean during lowstands and vary little throughout the sea-level cycle. How, when, and where do incised valleys form during RSL fall has important implications for connectivity of the incised channels offshore (at the shelf edge) and the distributary channels onshore. As the incised channels retrogressively backstep they reactivate the distributary channels on the margin and can liberate large volumes of sediment to the basin in potentially a short period of time. Furthermore, the rates of incision and reactivation, as well as the upstream extent of reactivation are important factors to consider. It is clear that further comparison of observations and model predictions are required to understand the response of fluviodeltaic systems during sealevel falls."}, {"section_title": "A.1 INTRODUCTION", "text": "Heave artifacts result when the ship position is influence by waves.
