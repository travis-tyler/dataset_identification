Discussion: CSF markers of vascular, lipid-metabolic and immune-related functions may explain much of the disjunction between AD biomarker abnormality and symptom severity.

The resulting AD pandemic creates an imperative to search anew for mechanisms that provoke AD symptoms [2] . Identification of such mechanisms can suggest the development of rational treatments.\nDespite enormous information gained, the prevailing hypotheses regarding AD pathogenesis have failed to deliver strategies for mitigation of symptoms. Disappointment is perhaps greatest with respect to the amyloid cascade hypothesis [3] . Substantial evidence supports this conception that oligomerization or aggregation of neurotoxic amyloid b (Ab) peptides provokes neurodegenerative changes including intraneuronal deposits of hyperphosphorylated and misfolded tau protein, leading in turn to synaptic dysfunction [4] . Hopes here were bolstered, but as yet to no avail, by demonstration that much of this change occurs before the onset of cognitive symptoms [5, 6] , the ideal time for preventive interventions. Especially frustrating has been the finding that anti-amyloid therapies have succeeded in \"target engagement,\" removing or reducing amyloid burden, with little or no symptomatic benefit and even a potential for harm [7] [8] [9] .\nAlso popular has been the idea that neurodegeneration in AD results from the deleterious consequences of an innate immune response that accompanies its pathogenesis [10] . This theory was buttressed by epidemiologic findings of reduced AD occurrence in persons with chronic inflammatory disease [11] and in long-term users of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [12] . Later observational studies in older patients failed to confirm any advantage of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use, however [13] , and large-scale treatment and prevention trials showed that anti-inflammatory drugs brought no benefit [14] or even possible harm [15] [16] [17] .\nMore recently, the genetics of later-onset AD have pointed again to immune as well as lipid metabolic pathways [18] , while additional observations have linked AD risk to vascular health [19, 20] . For instance, central nervous system (CNS) vascular and blood-brain barrier dysfunction may lead to abnormal accumulation of the AD pathological hallmarks [21] . Altered innate immune functions appear to provoke related changes [22] [23] [24] , and lipid dysmetabolism is implied by the strong association of AD risk with polymorphisms at apolipoprotein-encoding genes such as APOE (especially) and CLU (Apo J) [25, 26] . Recent data-driven analyses further suggest that changes in some of these pathways occur before accumulation of Ab abnormality [27, 28] . AD therefore appears to represent a failure of several interrelated biological systems. To date, however, investigation of these intertwined pathways has not suggested a route to prevention.\nOften overlooked in the search for causes of AD morbidity has been a poorly understood divergence between biological pathogenesis and symptom expression. This \"disconnect\" is best exemplified by observations that some 20%-30% of older persons whose autopsy results reveal extensive AD pathology were cognitively unimpaired before death [29] [30] [31] . Such findings have since been corroborated in vivo through positron emission tomography (PET) imaging [32] [33] [34] . These and related observations of symptomatic \"resilience\" [35] suggest that one might suppress the expression of AD dementia and related cognitive symptoms despite the presence of the disease's pathological hallmarks. We suggest that this phenomenon of resilience presents a potential pathway to symptom prevention. Some psychosocial and behavioral antecedents of symptomatic resilience are known [36, 37] , and other recent work has identified biological factors that may exacerbate or reduce cognitive decline [38] [39] [40] . Nonetheless, further elucidation of biological determinants of symptomatic resilience may offer more practical potential pathways for pharmacologic intervention.\nTo undertake a fresh examination of the last topic, we conducted a series of unbiased searches for biological correlates of symptomatic resilience among 306 participants in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI-1) who had donated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). This work relied on an expectation that relevant biological pathways should typically be associated with CSF protein markers of their activity. In previous studies among a subset of this sample, we had identified 23 CSF proteins associated with the AD pathological process [41] . Here, we investigated the latter markers' possible role in symptomatic resilience by assessing their ability to predict cognitive performance and trajectory in relation to a given level of apparent AD pathology."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "We downloaded data from http://adni.loni.usc.edu.

We studied 306 ADNI-1 participants across the AD clinical spectrum having available CSF data. These included 90 healthy controls (HC), 147 persons with MCI, and 69 with AD dementia. ADNI assessed the cognitive status of these persons annually using the 11-and 13-point versions of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-Cog 11 and ADAS-Cog 13 ) [42] as well as the Mini-Mental State Examination [43] .

We assigned the 306 ADNI participants to groups according to their CSF Ab 1-42 and t-tau levels, considering them to be \"amyloid-positive\" if their Ab concentrations were below the ADNIrecommended threshold value of 192 pg/mL. Similarly, \"tau-positive\" individuals had t-tau values exceeding 93 pg/mL [44] . The ADNI also attempted to assay CSF levels for 159 other proteins using a multiplex X-Map kit from Rules Based Medicine (Myriad RBM, Austin, TX). Rigorous quality control (QC) standards led to exclusion of markers with unacceptable variability in assay results or .10% missing data, yielding only 83 acceptable measures.

On each of ten iterations, we omitted one such set and optimized model weights and penalization parameters for the remaining nine. Averaging marker weights across the ten cross-validation folds then yielded optimal consensus models. We estimated the predictive capacity of these consensus models in the training set by examining predicted versus observed ADAS-Cog scores. Finally, we tested the generalizability of the models by applying them to the never-before-seen validation set.

We tested this marker summary score as a predictor of contrasting ADNI diagnostic categories (HC vs. MCI, MCI vs. AD dementia, or HC vs. AD dementia) using multinomial logistic regression. Importantly, we adjusted the regression model not only for age, sex, education, and APOE \u03b54 carrier status, but also for CSF Ab 1-42 and t-tau levels.

The training and validation sets were comparable in age, sex ratio, years of education, MMSE, as well as CSF total (t)-tau and Ab . However, there was some disparity in distribution of clinical diagnostic categories, the training set having disproportionate numbers of HCs and fewer AD participants (c 2 5 9.41, P 5 .01). Presumably owing to its larger proportion of subjects with dementia, the validation set also had somewhat higher (worse) ADAS-Cog 11 scores than the training set (P 5 .02). Of note, 34 (38%) HC participants had CSF evidence of Ab pathology, making them especially suitable candidates for the investigation of symptomatic resilience. Fig. 1 shows the results of the LASSO modeling approach. Model 1 (AD biomarkers only) demonstrated good predictive accuracy in the training set and generalizability in the never-before-seen validation set, explaining 26% of ADAS score variance in the latter (P , 10 27 ).

The combination of CSF protein markers and AD biomarkers (model 3) best predicted ADAS-Cog 11 scores, explaining 41% of their variance (P , 10 213 ), a significant improvement over both model 1 and model 2 (P w .01 and .05; Fig. 2 ).

To do this, we used a 200-person training set of participants from ADNI-1, applying LASSO regression with a ten-fold cross-validation procedure to assign predictor variable weights. The three resulting models were then tested in a validation set of the remaining 106 ADNI participants. We found that the AD biomarker and CSF protein models appeared to be additive, with the contributions of their constituent variables being mostly independent. Lack of collinearity between the two sets of markers was further suggested by the relative invariance of protein marker weights in the conjoint Model 3 versus that derived from the proteins only (Model 2).\nIn particular, the protein marker Model 2 predicted disjunction between degree of AD pathology and symptom expression. Not only did it predict (cross-sectional) cognitive performance in the never-before-seen validation set, a summary score derived from its constituent marker weights also provided strong prediction of ADNI clinical diagnostic category. Importantly, the latter prediction survived statistical adjustment for CSF levels of Ab and tau as well as AD risk factors and, notably, cognitive score.

In fully adjusted models that also included a term for baseline cognitive score and diagnosis, the inverse-weighted protein marker summary score also predicted rate of cognitive change over the succeeding four years. Together, these observations suggest that AD-related protein markers are strongly associated with baseline cognition, with cognitive diagnosis, and with cognitive decline associated with a given level of AD biomarker \"pathology.\" Limitation of this effect to the 23 AD-associated markers was suggested by the absence of any similar prediction of cognitive outcomes in models constructed from multiple sets of 23 \"control\" markers from the remaining 60 ADNI-1 protein species."}, {"section_title": "Function of the predictive CSF proteins", "text": "While these findings await independent confirmation, we suggest it is reasonable here to consider mechanistic explanations that might advance our understanding of symptomatic resilience to AD pathology. Notably, most of the predictive capability of the 23 AD-related proteins resided in ten marker species that were responsible for .95% of the observed effect (data not shown). In models that included (were adjusted for) Ab and tau levels, these were fatty acid-binding protein (FABP), apoJ, apoE, angiotensin-converting enzyme, Cg-A, CD-40a, VEGF, HGF, Transforming Growth Factor a, and macrophage colony stimulating factor-1. Among these, only HGF appeared to be collinear with the AD biomarkers, becoming inapparent as a predictor of cognitive outcomes when analyses included the biomarkers. A gene ontology analysis suggested that the nine remaining proteins are involved in a variety of overlapping mechanisms involved in lipid metabolic, immune, and vascular pathways.\nThe functions of several of these proteins recall findings from the genetics of late-onset AD. For example, apoE protein (determined by APOE genotype, the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset AD after age) was among the nine key protein markers. ApoJ (clusterin), conditioned by the CLU risk polymorphism [26] , was another key \"predictor.\" Both apoE and apoJ appear to be involved in a dynamic equilibrium between Ab plaques and soluble Ab species, possibly owing to their role in cholesterol transport [48] (for apoE) or in breakdown of protein aggregates (for apoJ) [49] . ApoE also has an important role in astrocyte-mediated clearance of Ab [50] . Recent data suggest it may also be important in microglial activation in neurodegenerative diseases via coupling with the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM-2) pathway [51] , the product of another important AD risk gene. FABP is also implicated in the transport of lipids and may be elevated in the CSF of patients with AD and individuals with progressive MCI [52] .\nFABP-mediated lipid metabolism may also be linked to inflammatory processes [53] , in keeping with a broader notion that CNS lipid metabolism is important to innate immune activation. It is probably not surprising, therefore, that the aforementioned three proteins conjoin Fig. 2 . Statistical comparison of models trained to predict baseline ADAS Cog -11 performance. Each model's performance was evaluated in the unseen validation set. Bars represent proportion of variance explained (R 2 ! 100) for each model. We generated 95% confidence intervals using bootstrapping (5000 iterations) and used a bootstrap test to compare models. with four other evidently immune-related markers among the \"short list\" of nine proteins that appear to modify clinical outcomes. Specifically, CD-40a is a key mediator of immune activation believed to hold an early role in the pathogenesis of AD [54, 55] . It activates antigen presenting T cells while it regulates the deposition of Ab. Cg-A is similarly associated with CNS microglial activation [56, 57] . Although important to vascular homeostasis [58] , VEGF has been shown also to induce microglial chemotaxis and proliferation [59, 60] and to be an important mediator of the immune response to tumors [61] . Macrophage colony stimulating factor-1 causes proliferation and differentiation of macrophages, regulates number of microglial cells and their state of differentiation, and promotes neuronal survival [62, 63] . Notably, each of the aforementioned four \"immunerelated\" markers was inversely related to ADAS-Cog score, that is, higher levels predicted improved cognition. Because there has been a widespread assumption that \"inflammatory\" processes exert a deleterious influence on AD symptom development (see Section 4.3 below), we had expected higher levels of these four markers to be associated with increasing symptom severity, but we found the opposite to be true. This observation appears to converge with other evidence that some enhanced immune responses can be beneficial for individuals who are older [64] or who have established AD dementia [65] . Therefore, the described functions of the predictive markers may suggest that immune activation occurs as a response to insults such as AD pathology, presumably involving activation and recruitment of immune cells. Such activation could, in some instances, enhance clearance of toxic proteins and promotion of cell survival, thereby resulting in improved cognitive outcomes for a given level of AD pathology."}, {"section_title": "Variance explained (%)", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Strengths and limitations", "text": "The principal strength of this work appears to be its reliance on an unbiased data-driven, hypothesis-free approach to identify markers associated with both AD pathology and symptom expression. Our analytical plan was based on rigorous cross-validation and internal validation procedures to build models from important predictors that generalized well to unseen data.\nHowever, several limitations should also be noted. Most importantly, these analyses relied on data from a protein screen of ADNI CSF that was assayed using multiplex technology. The ADNI investigators had initially attempted to assay 159 proteins, only 83 of which passed quality control criteria. Such results occur typically because of insufficient assay sensitivity for many analytes, here including several key markers of immune activation. Furthermore, despite their apparent links to immune activation, the predictive proteins act at the interface of several processes thought to be key in the AD cascade. It remains possible, therefore, that other pathways may act independently or in concert with immune activation to modulate, and possibly improve, cognitive function. A further limitation of our analyses was their reliance principally on cross-sectional data, limiting our ability to infer ordinality or causality of the observed associations. Finally, we relied on CSF Ab and tau as indicators of the extent of AD pathology (an important component in the phenomenon of resilience). Unfortunately, we could not include PET measures of Ab or tau pathology because few Weighted marker score Fig. 4 .

Higher summary scores were associated with a decrease in ADAS Cog -11 scores (P , .005). As expected, this apparent relationship was diminished moderately with adjustment for baseline cognitive performance (right), but summary scores remained robustly associated with longitudinal cognitive decline (P , .02).

Similarly, cortical thickness data from a region of interest, as described by Jack et al. [66] , or hippocampal volume as measures of AD progression also resulted in significant missing data (w20%), although these yielded similar results in reduced samples (data not shown). Before their significance can be fully evaluated, therefore, our results require corroboration in other data sets, preferably using assay methods with improved sensitivity as well as other indicators of AD pathology.\nNevertheless, the available data suggest an important pathway for modification, and possible amelioration, of symptomatic expression of AD and therefore a hypothesis for future investigation."}, {"section_title": "A hypothesis and experimental approaches to its assessment", "text": "Hypothesis: Immune activation modulates the cognitive and functional deficits that otherwise accompany the accrual of \"classical\" AD pathology.\nIt has long been understood that immune activation accompanies evidence of the AD process [67] . Early epidemiological studies showed an inverse association between anti-inflammatory drug use and AD risk [12, 68] . These findings led to widespread speculation that AD pathology induced immune activation, which in turn generated a neurotoxic environment, neuronal death, and eventually dementia [69] . This formulation recalls other instances in which uncontrolled CNS immune responses lead to nervous system damage and cognitive impairment (e.g., in Lyme disease) [70] . In neurodegenerative disease models, maladaptive immune responses appear to provoke neuronal death through the generation of reactive astrocytes [71] . The present results are at odds with these ideas, however, suggesting instead that some components of innate immune activation may be associated with improved cognitive outcomes in AD. This improvement might result from increased clearance of Ab species [72] , a process in which astrocytes appear also to play an important role [50] .\nImportantly, most CNS immune responses are provided by microglia and astrocytes. These cells have multiple functions and roles at the interplay of pathways thought to be involved in AD pathogenesis. For instance, astrocytes are the main producers of apoE protein in the CNS and are clearly involved in blood brain barrier (BBB) function and in the clearance of Ab and neurotoxic neurotransmitters [73] . In addition, both astrocytes and microglia help maintain CNS homeostasis and provide trophic support to neurons. While malfunction of these important cells may result from accumulating AD pathology, they may also be the cause of such pathology by provoking either accumulation of pathological proteins, BBB dysfunction, or deterioration and loss of trophic support. Any of these may promote neurodegeneration. In this context, it appears noteworthy that risk alleles at the polymorphic TREM-2 and CD-33 genetic loci are associated with reduced microglial clearance of Ab plaques [22, 74, 75] . These loss-of-function mutations result in reduced microglial activation and clustering around plaques [76] .\nAn important limitation of the latter observations, however, is that they derive mainly from animal models. We know of no present evidence of similar mechanisms in human studies, notably because these efforts have encountered difficulties in reliable measurement of the most important markers of immune activation in CSF [77, 78] . Thus, to date, human studies of association between disease and fluid markers of inflammation have yielded contrasting results [79] .\nWhile we and others have observed reduced CSF immune marker levels in individuals with evidence of \"pure\" amyloid pathology [41, 80] , (thereby suggesting that a maladaptive immune response might result in brain accrual of Ab) the noted limitations in measurement sensitivity restricted our analysis to only 23 markers. Measurement of many other protein markers, particularly other markers of immune activity, could render a more complete analysis of biological networks involved. Future efforts to test the proposed hypothesis and identify its related pathways will therefore require newer immune marker assay methods having improved sensitivity. Although costly, these techniques should allow identification and measurement of many more relevant immune marker proteins.\nAs here, an expanded set of envisioned assay results would benefit from the use of unbiased, data-driven feature selection approaches. Importantly, these techniques identify and assess the relevance of individual markers in the context of all others. An important objective of the proposed work should be to identify which among many available markers of immune activity have the greatest apparent \"effect\" on cognitive outcomes-a topic not readily studied in animal models of preclinical AD. These markers, or families of them, can in turn suggest specific immune pathways relevant to the phenomenon of resilience, thereby prompting additional focused biological investigation using modern, high-resolution techniques.\nFinally, we would note that our current or proposed analyses relate to cross-sectional data and therefore cannot assess important questions about the ordinality and potential causality of discovered associations. To answer these last questions, longitudinal data will be needed. Such data could in turn be analyzed using recently introduced machine-learning algorithms that can provide a virtual \"motion picture\" of sequential events in the biological pathways underlying resilience. Such work may also identify immune pathways involved in accumulation or clearance of pathological proteins and symptomatic resilience, thereby pointing more directly to timing at which pathways could be either upregulated or downregulated to achieve symptom mitigation. Together with other biological or mechanistic experimentation mentioned previously, results from such studies may suggest promising new targets for novel prevention strategies."}]
