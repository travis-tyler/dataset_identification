[{"section_title": "", "text": "Brain structural and microstructural differences are phenotypically associated with 1 many other complex traits across different categories, such as cognitive measures 1-5 , 2 neurodegenerative/neuropsychiatric traits [6] [7] [8] [9] , alcohol and tobacco consumption 10 , and 3 physical bone density 11 . Structural variations of human brain can be quantified by 4 multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Specifically, the T1-weighted MRI 5 (T1-MRI) can provide basic morphometric information of brain tissues, such as volume, 6 surface area, sulcal depth, and cortical thickness. In region of interest (ROI)-based 7 T1-MRI analysis, images are annotated onto ROIs of pre-defined brain atlas, and then 8 both global (e.g., whole brain, gray matter, white matter) and local (e.g., basal ganglia 9 structures, limbic and diencephalic regions) markers can be generated to measure the 10 brain anatomy. On the other hand, diffusion MRI (dMRI) can capture local tissue 11 microstructure through the random movement of water. Using diffusion tensor imaging 12 (DTI) models, brain structural connectivity can be quantified by using white matter 13 tracts extracted from dMRI, which build psychical connections among brain ROIs and are 14 involved in connected networks for various brain functions 12, 13 . See Miller, et al. 11 and 15 Elliott, et al. 14 for a global overview and more information about neuroimaging 16 modalities used in the present study. 17 18 Structural neuroimaging traits have shown moderate to high degree of heritability in 19 both twin and population-based studies [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . In the past ten years, genome-wide 20 association studies (GWAS) 3, 14, [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] have been conducted to identify the associated 21 genetic variants (typically single-nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs]) for brain structures. 22\nA highly polygenic 34, 35 genetic architecture has been observed, indicating that a large 23 number of genetic variants contribute to the brain structure variations measured by 24 neuroimaging biomarkers 21, 36 . Particularly, using data from the UK Biobank (UKB 39 ) 25 cohort, two recent large-scale GWAS have identified 578 associated genes for 101 26 regional brain volumes derived from T1-MRI 37 (referred as ROI volumes, n=19,629) and 27 110 DTI parameters of dMRI 38 (referred as DTI parameters, n=17, 706) . Some of these 28 discovered genes had been implicated with the same or other traits such as cognition 29 and mental health diseases/disorders in previous GWAS. However, most of them have 30 not been verified and need further investigations. As a supplement to traditional GWAS, 31 recent advances of gene expression imputation methods [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] and developments of 32 reference databases (e.g., the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project 47 ) have put 1 the transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) forward for gene-trait association 2 analysis. Despite some challenges 48 such as interpreting causality, TWAS has successfully 3 discovered novel gene-trait associations and provided new insights into biological 4 mechanisms for many complex traits 49 . Through imputed transcriptomes, TWAS can 5 reduce the multiple testing burden and leverage gene expression data to increase 6 testing power for gene-trait association detection. This is a particularly desirable feature 7 for imaging genetics studies, for which most of neuroimaging GWAS datasets continue 8 to have small sample sizes and heavy multiple testing burden 50 . 9 10 Here we applied TWAS methods to 211 structural neuroimaging traits including 101 ROI 11 volumes and 110 DTI parameters. As these brain-related traits tend to be highly 12 polygenic 21, 36 and are related with many traits across different categories 11 , we used a 13 cross-tissue (panel) TWAS approach (UTMOST 42 ) in our main analysis. UTMOST first 14 performs single-tissue gene-trait association analysis in each reference panel with both 15 within-tissue and cross-tissue statistical penalties, and then combines these single-tissue 16 results using the Generalized Berk-Jones (GBJ) test 51 , which is aware of 17 tissue-dependence and can account for the potential sharing of local expression 18 regulation across tissues. The UKB dataset was used in the discovery phase (n=19,629 19 for ROI volumes and 17,706 for DTI parameters, respectively). For the same UKB cohort, 20 we compared TWAS-significant genes to previous GWAS findings in gene-based 21 association analysis via MAGMA 52 and gene-level functional mapping and annotation 22 results by FUMA 53 . The UKB TWAS results were validated in five independent data 23 sources, including Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC 54 ,n=537), Alzheimer's 24 Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI 55 , n=860), Pediatric Imaging, Neurocognition, and 25 Genetics (PING 56 , n=461), the Human Connectome Project (HCP 57 , n=334), and the 26 ENIGMA2 24 and ENIGMA-CHARGE collaboration 33 (n=13, 193, for 8 ROI volume traits, 27 referred as ENIGMA in this paper). Additional TWAS analysis was performed on 11 28 cognitive and mental traits to explore their genetics overlaps with brain structures. 29\nChromatin interaction enrichment analysis and drug-target lookups were conducted for 30 TWAS-significant genes. Finally, we developed TWAS gene-based polygenic risk scores 58 31 (PRS) using FUSION 40 to fully assess polygenic architecture and examine the predictive 1 ability of the UKB TWAS results. 2 3 RESULTS 4\nOverview of TWAS discovery-validation in the six datasets 5\nWe conducted a two-phase discovery-validation TWAS analysis for 211 neuroimaging 6 traits by using the UKB cohort for discovery and the other datasets (ADNI, HCP, PING, 7 PNC, and ENIGMA) for validation. We applied the UTMOST gene expression imputation 8 models trained on 44 GETx (v6) reference panels, and used GWAS summary statistics 9 generated from previous GWAS as inputs. In the rest of this paper, we refer 1.37*10 -8 10 (that is, 5*10 -2 /17,290/211, adjusted for all candidate genes and traits performed) as 11 the significance threshold for gene-trait associations unless otherwise stated. 12"}, {"section_title": "13", "text": "The UKB discovery phase identified 614 significant gene-trait associations 14\n( Supplementary Table 1 ) between 204 genes and 135 neuroimaging traits (53 ROI 15 volumes, 82 DTI parameters) . Of the 204 TWAS-significant genes, 61 (29.9%) had 16 significant associations with more than two neuroimaging traits, 25 (12.3%) had more 17 than five significant associations, and 12 (5.9%) had at least ten, including OSER1, XRCC4, 18 PLEKHM1, ZKSCAN4, EIF4EBP3, MAPT, LRRC37A, CRHR1, FOXF1, TREH, ARHGAP27, and 19 C6orf100. These 12 genes together contributed 195 (31.8%) of the 614 gene-trait 20 associations, indicating their widespread influences on brain structures. Specifically, we 21 identified 123 genes whose imputed gene expression levels were significantly associated 22 with one of more of the 53 ROI volumes (215 associations in total, 115 new, 23 Supplementary Fig. 1 ), and 103 significantly associated genes (22 overlapping) for one 24 or more of the 82 DTI parameters (399 associations in total, 219 new, Supplementary 25 Figure 1 illustrates that TWAS prioritized previous GWAS findings of MAGMA and 26 FUMA and also discovered many new associations and genes. Moreover, some genes 27 were associated with both ROI volumes and DTI parameters, while others were more 28 specifically related to certain structures (Supplementary Fig. 3 ). For example, XRCC4, 29 ZKSCAN4, EIF4EBP3, and CD14 were associated with DTI parameters but not ROI 30 volumes, DEFB124, COX4I2, HCK, HM13, and REM1 showed associations with putamen 31 and pallidum volumes, and the associations of PLEKHM1, LRRC37A, MAPT, CNNM2, 32 The other 86 genes had not been linked to brain structure previously and thus can be 23 regarded as novel genes for these 211 neuroimaging traits. To explore the genetic 24 overlaps with other traits in different domains, we performed association lookups for 25 the 90 TWAS-significant genes on the NHGRI-EBI GWAS catalog (Supplementary Table  26 8). Figure 2 shows that these genes were widely associated with physical measures (e.g., 27\nheight, waist-to-hip ratio, heel bone mineral density, body mass index), cognitive traits 28 (e.g., cognitive function, intelligence, math ability), neuropsychiatric and 29 neurodegenerative diseases/disorders (e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, Alzheimer's 30 disease), coronary artery disease, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, neuroticism, 31 education, reaction time, chronotype, smoking behavior and alcohol use, such as 1 CDK2AP1 [64] [65] [66] [67] and SH2B1 72, [74] [75] [76] . 2 3 For the 18 TWAS-validated genes shown in Supplementary Fig. 4 , 8 (ANKRD42, DCC, 4 LRRC37A, NUP210L, DOK5, C20orf166 , and DPP4) of them had been 5 discovered in the previous UKB GWAS and were implicated in brain-related complex 6 traits, such as neuroticism 64 , major depression 77 , schizophrenia 78-80 , Intelligence 81 , math 7 ability 73 , reaction time 75 , and insomnia 82 . The left ten genes, which were novel findings 8 of TWAS, also had known associations with many cognitive and mental health traits. For 9 example, previous GWAS reported that HCK was associated with chronotype 82 , LGALS3 10 with schizophrenia 83 , UBE2C with reaction time 75 , KLRD1 with adolescent idiopathic 11 scoliosis 84 , OSER1 with cognitive performance 77 and Alzheimer's disease 76 , and PRPF3 12 with chronotype 76,85 and neuropsychiatric disorders 86 . In summary, TWAS novel and 13 validated genes expand the overview of gene-level pleiotropy across these traits, 14\nsuggesting that neuroimaging-derived biomarkers could be useful in studying a wide 15 range of complex traits. 16 17 Compared to brain tissue-specific TWAS analysis 18\nAs a comparison, we performed a brain tissue-specific version of TWAS that only 19 combines brain tissues in UTMOST (Method). This brain tissue-specific TWAS detected 20 308 significant gene-trait associations ( Supplementary Table 9 ) between 107 unique 21 genes and 96 neuroimaging traits, including 64 associated genes for one or more of 37 22 ROI volumes (104 associations, Supplementary Fig. 7) , and 53 genes (10 overlapping) for 23 one or more of 59 DTI parameters (204 associations, Supplementary Fig. 8 ). 24 25 Most (101/107) of the tissue-specific genes have been identified by either the 26 cross-tissue TWAS (95/107) or previous GWAS (70/107). The 6 genes that were uniquely 27 identified by tissue-specific analysis included KNCN, LHFPL3, MBD2, TBK1, C3orf62, and 28 TMEM173. LHFPL3 showed associations with education 87 , social behavior 88,89 , cognitive 29 ability 75 , schizophrenia 90 , and bipolar disorder 91 . MBD2 was associated with reaction 30 time 75 , TBK1 with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 92,93 , and C3orf62 with intelligence 82 . 31\nCompared to tissue-specific TWAS, cross-tissue analysis clearly identified more signals. 32\nFor example, of the 215 gene-trait associations identified by cross-tissue analysis of ROI 1 volumes, 100 had been identified in GWAS, 28 can be additionally identified by 2 tissue-specific TWAS, and 87 can only be detected by cross-tissue analysis 3 ( Supplementary Fig. 9) . Similarly, 180 of the 399 cross-tissue TWAS associations for DTI 4 can be identified in GWAS, 69 can be additionally identified by tissue-specific TWAS, and 5 150 were cross-tissue TWAS only (Supplementary Fig. 10) . These results illustrate the 6 advantage of cross-tissue analysis over brain tissue-specific TWAS for discovering 7 association signals that are difficult to be identified in traditional GWAS. We further 8 compared their results in a few follow-up analyses below. 9 10"}, {"section_title": "Comparison with GWAS variant-level signals and conditional analysis 11", "text": "For each of the 614 gene-trait associations detected in cross-trait TWAS, we used 12 previous GWAS summary statistics to check the most significant variant within the gene 13 region (with a 1MB window on each side) that was pinpointed in the same UKB dataset 14 (Method). The GWAS p-value of the most significant variant was greater than 1*10 -6 for 15 any associations of 13 genes ( Supplementary Table 10 ). None of them had been 16 identified by MAGMA or FUMA, indicating that it can be difficult to detect these genes 17 by GWAS or post-GWAS screening for any of these neuroimaging traits. Of the 13 genes, 18 7 (OSER1, TREH, PRPF3, KLRD1, TGM7, DCTPP1, UBE2C) were validated in one or more 19 of the five validation datasets and were discussed in previous section. For the other 6 20 genes (CELSR3, MYO9A, DNAJC24, GYPE, TMEM136, MOB4) genes, MOB4 was reported 21 for major depression 94 and autism spectrum disorder/schizophrenia 95 , DNAJC24 was 22 linked to adolescent idiopathic scoliosis 84 , and CELSR3 was associated with education 65 23 and cognitive ability 64,81 . The same checking was then performed for the 308 significant 24 gene-trait associations of brain tissue-specific TWAS. We found that only one gene 25 DCTPP1 had minimum GWAS p-value greater than 1*10 -6 ( Supplementary Table 11 ). 26"}, {"section_title": "27", "text": "We next performed a conditional analysis to see whether the TWAS signals remained 28 significant after adjustment for the most significant genetic variant used in UTMOST 29 gene expression imputation models (Method). Although our cross-tissue analysis 30 combined information from many genetic variants across various human tissues, we 31 found that 418 of the 614 associations may indeed be dominated by the strongest 32 GWAS signal of the imputation model, as their conditional p-values were larger than 1 0.05 ( Supplementary Table 12 ). However, the conditional p-values of four genes (XRCC4, 2 OBFC1, C15orf56, NMT1) were smaller than 1*10 -6 for 18 gene-trait associations, 3 suggesting that these associations were unlikely to be driven by a signal genetic variant. 4\nWhen the p-value threshold was relaxed to 1*10 -3 , 66 associations of 20 genes persisted 5 after conditional analysis. The conditional analysis was also performed on significant 6 associations of brain tissue-specific TWAS. Their conditional p-values were smaller than 7 1*10 -6 for three genes (XRCC4, C15orf56, NMT1) with 15 associations, and were smaller 8 than 1*10 -3 for 10 genes with 42 associations ( Supplementary Table 13 ). 9 10 Additional TWAS analysis for cognitive and mental health traits 11\nTo further explore the gene-level genetic overlaps among brain structure and other 12 brain-related traits, we performed cross-tissue TWAS analysis for 11 cognitive and 13 mental health traits ( Supplementary Table 14 ).

These results 16 suggest the genes involved in brain structure changes are often also active in brain 17 functions and mental disorder/diseases. For example, we found 33 overlapping genes 18 with cognitive function, 32 with education, 26 with numerical reasoning, 25 with 19 intelligence, 23 with neuroticism, 19 with drinking behavior, and 13 with schizophrenia. 20 A large proportion (48/69) of these genes were associated with more than one cognitive 21 or mental health traits, and 11 genes were linked to at least five traits, including SCML4, 22\nC16orf54, DCC, NFATC2IP, NPIPB7, NPIPB9, SH2B1, CRHR1, LRRC37A, HIST1H2BO, and 23 NKAPL, indicating the high degree of statistical pleiotropy 96 of these genes. 24 25"}, {"section_title": "Chromatin interaction enrichment analysis and drug-target lookups 26", "text": "To explore the biological interpretations of TWAS and GWAS-significant genes, we 27 performed enrichment analysis in promoter-related chromatin interactions of four types 28 of brain neurons 97 (iPSC-induced excitatory neurons, iPSC-derived hippocampal DG-like 29 neurons, iPSC-induced lower motor neurons, and primary astrocytes), and also in high 30 confident interactions of adult and fetal cortex 98 (Method). The raw p-values of 31\nWilcoxon rank test for enrichment were summarized in Supplementary Table 15 .

The prediction analysis was conducted separately on 52 reference panels (13 6 GETx v7 brain tissues, 35 GTEx v7 other tissues, 1 non-GETx brain tissue, and 3 non-GETx 7 other tissues) using the FUSION 40 software and database. We found that genetically 8 predicted profiles for 28 ROI volumes ( Figure 5 ) and 23 DTI parameters (Supplementary 9 Fig. 11 ) were significantly associated with the corresponding observed traits in all 10 testing datasets after Bonferroni correction (that is, 101*4+3*110=734 tests). Compared 11 to previous SNP-based PRS analysis that yielded significant PRS profiles for 11 ROI 12 volumes 37 , gene-based PRS profiles were significant for more ROI volumes, such as 13 left/right insula, left/right pallidum, left/right ventral DC, left/right fusiform, and 14 left/right transverse temporal, suggesting the substantial power gain in association 15 analysis of PRS. The significant TWAS PRS can account for 0.97%-6.97% phenotypic 16 variance (p-value range=[8.0*10 -29 , 6.81*10 -5 ]) ( Supplementary Tables 19-20) , which 17 was within the similar range to SNP-based PRS analysis. For example, the (incremental) 18 R-squared of TWAS PRS of Cerebellar vermal lobules VIII-X was 6.97% in PNC and 6.48% 19 in HCP, and the R-squared of SFO MD-derived TWAS PRS was 3.8% in PING and 2.41% in 20 PNC.

There was a significant linear relationship between the panel sample size and 22 average prediction R-squared (48 GTEx reference panels, simple correlation=0.53, 23 p-value=1.21*10 -4 , Supplementary Fig. 12 ), which means that currently panel sample 24 size may dominate the performance of TWAS PRS analysis regardless of the tissue 25 specificity 58 . Among the brain tissue panels, we found that cerebellum tissue had the 26 largest sample size and also showed the highest average R-squared (Supplementary 27 In this study, we applied TWAS methods on 211 neuroimaging traits to identify genes, 31 whose imputed expression levels were associated with brain structure variations.

We also performed 5 brain tissue-specific TWAS and illustrated the unique strengths of cross-tissue TWAS in 6 conditional and enrichment analyses. Lots of brain structure-related genes were known 7 genetic factors for a wide range of complex traits, ranging from physical traits, cognition, 8 mental disease/disorders, blood assays, to lifestyle, which extend the potential 9 applications of neuroimaging traits.

First, since these results are purely based on 13 statistical associations, it is hard to draw conclusions about the underlying causality and 14 prioritize causal genes 42,100 . This is also one of the main challenges for most of the 15 current TWAS approaches 48 . Follow-up experimental validation is a clear need to 16 confirm TWAS results and pinpoint the causal genes of brain structure changes. Second, 17 the brain tissue-specific TWAS did not yield much new results compared to the previous 18 GWAS and brain tissue panels did not show better prediction accuracy than non-brain 19 tissues in gene-based PRS analysis. Both of the two observations support the use of 20 multiple tissues in our analysis to increase testing power for association analysis, but 21 making the causality interpretation of TWAS results even more complicated. In addition, 22 though gene-based PRS had much better power in association tests than SNP-based 23 polygenic scores, their prediction accuracies were similar. These limitations may be due 24 to the fact that currently brain tissue reference panels do not have large sample size 25 and/or the associated gene expression imputations may have low quality. Despite these 26 limitations, it is clear that TWAS have the potential to become a powerful supplement to 27 traditional GWAS in imaging genetics studies. In our study, many new gene-trait 28 associations were discovered and the underlying genetic overlaps among complex traits 29 were largely expanded. With better brain tissue gene expression reference panels and 30 more neuroimaging GWAS datasets available, future TWAS analyses of neuroimaging 31 traits are expected to show the value of tissue specificity and improve our 1 understanding for the genetic basis of human brain. 2 3 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 4\nThis research was partially supported by U.S. NIH grants MH086633 (H.Z.) and 5 MH116527 (TF.L.).

For the high confident 13\ninteractions of adult and fetal cortex, the enrichment of each gene was measured as the 14 sum of -log10(P-value) of all significant interactions overlapping the gene 98 . The 15 drug-target lookups were conducted using the drug-gene associations reported in Wang, 16 et al. 99 .

In this analysis, we used the individual-level phenotype 23 and genetic data, whose processing steps were detailed in previous GWAS 37,38 . The 24 FUSION software and database (http://gusevlab.org/projects/fusion/) were used to 25 impute gene expression levels in UKB, ADNI, HCP, PNC, and PING datasets using 26 individual-level genetic data. We performed imputation for 52 different reference 27 panels ( Supplementary Table 21 ). In training data (UKB), we estimated the effect size of 28 each imputed gene expression in a linear regression model, while adjusting for the age 29 (at imaging), age-squared, sex, age-sex interaction, age-squared-sex interaction, as well 30 as the top 40 genetic principle components (PCs) provided by UKB 101 (Data-Field 22009). 31\nFor ROI volumes, we also included total brain volume (for ROIs other than total brain 32 volume itself) as a covariate. The gene-based PRS were generated in testing data by 1 summarizing across imputed gene expressions, weighed by their effect sizes estimated 2 from the training data. We tried a series of p-value thresholds for predictor selection: 1, 3 0.8, 0.5, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1, 0.08, 0.05, 0.02, 0.01, 0.001, 1*10 -4 , 1*10 -5 , 1*10 -6 , 1*10 -7 , and 4 5*10 -8 . Thus, seventeen polygenic profiles were generated for each neuroimaging traits 5 and we reported the best prediction power that can be achieved by a single profile of 6 them in the single reference panel. The association between polygenic profile and trait 7 was estimated and tested in linear regression model, adjusting for the effects of age and 8 sex. The additional phenotypic variation that can be explained by polygenic profile (i.e., 9 the incremental R-squared) was used to measure the prediction power. 10 11"}, {"section_title": "Data availability 12", "text": "The individual-level data used in this work was obtained from five publicly available 13 datasets: the UK Biobank (UKB) study, the Human Connectome Project (HCP) study, the 14 Pediatric Imaging, Neurocognition, and Genetics (PING) study, the Philadelphia 15\nNeurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC) study, and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 16\nInitiative (ADNI) study.
