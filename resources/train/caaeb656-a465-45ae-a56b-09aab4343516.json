Accommodations (in testing): In HSLS:09, both in the base year and the first follow-up, certain accommodations were offered to students with barriers to participation, who otherwise may not have been able to participate. Several such accommodations focused on the assessment. In this context, an accommodation is a change in how a test is presented, in how a test is administered, or in how the test taker is allowed to respond. This term generally refers to changes that do not substantially alter what the test measures. The proper use of accommodations does not substantially change academic level or performance criteria. Appropriate accommodations were made to provide equal opportunity to demonstrate knowledge. Examples of test accommodations used in HSLS:09 include allowing extra time or conveying instructions in American Sign Language. Cases in which accommodations were implemented in HSLS:09 are specially flagged. Accommodations (in questionnaire administration): Special accommodations were provided to base-year and first follow-up students who could not otherwise participate in the study by completing a questionnaire. For example, students with learning disabilities or a visual impairment could have someone read the questionnaire aloud to them. Students were given extra time on the questionnaire, the assessment, or both, if they had an Individualized Education Program that made such a stipulation. Adaptive testing: In HSLS:09, both in the base year and first follow-up test administrations, three test forms of varying levels of difficulty were assigned based on the examinee's score (or more specifically, IRT-based pattern of responses) on a routing test. Thus, the specific form or set of questions that each student answered was tailored to that student's ability level. An advantage of adaptive tests is that reliability per unit of testing time is greater than in a nonadaptive test. Adaptive procedures help to minimize floor and ceiling effects, and by tailoring test items to ability level, minimize examinee frustration that could result when confronted with items far beyond the bounds of the examinee's ability. (See also Ceiling effect and Floor effect.) Administrator questionnaire: This questionnaire was completed by the school principal, sometimes in part with a knowledgeable designee, at all participating base-year schools. It inquired about school characteristics, student body, faculty, curriculum, and principal background and perception of school problems. An abbreviated version was administered to principals of refusal schools, to better monitor and adjust for nonresponse bias. The questionnaire was revised and readministered to principals in base-year schools in the first follow-up, An abbreviated version was administered to principals in \"transfer\" schools, that is, schools to which ninth-grade cohort members had dispersed by spring term of 2012. American Indian or Alaska Native: An American Indian or Alaska Native is a person who has origins in any of the original peoples of North and South America (including Central America) and who maintains tribal affiliation or community attachment. The primary source of race/ethnicity categorization in HSLS:09 was respondent self-identification. Analytic weights: Analytic weights are sometimes called nonresponse-adjusted weights, adjusted (base) weights, or final analytic weights. The analytic weights are constructed by adjusting the base weights for factors such as subsampling of sample units, one or more nonresponse mechanisms (e.g., parent refusal of student participation and student refusal), and calibration (i.e., benchmarked) to population counts. (See also Base weights and Calibration weight adjustment.) Asian: An Asian is a person having origins in any of the original peoples of the Far East, Southeast Asia, or the Indian subcontinent, including, for example, Cambodia, China, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippine Islands, Thailand, and Vietnam. The primary source of race/ethnicity categorization in HSLS:09 was respondent self-identification. Balanced repeated replication (BRR): BRR weights can be used in HSLS:09 for variance estimation. BRR weights are based on a set of procedures that use a balanced set of pseudo-replicates. The BRR variance estimation process involves modeling the design as if it were a two-primary sampling unit (PSU) per stratum design. Variances are then calculated using a random group type of variance estimation procedure, with a balanced set of replicates as the groups. Balancing is done by creating replicates using an orthogonal matrix. An alternative variance estimation method available from the HSLS:09 data set is the Taylor series linearization. (See also Taylor series linearization.) Base weights: Base weights compensate for unequal probabilities of selection into the study sample. A base weight is calculated as the inverse probability of selection and includes all stages of sample design (e.g., two design stages are used for HSLS:09). Base weights are also called raw weights, design weights, unadjusted weights, or sampling weights throughout the survey literature. Estimates using base weights may be contrasted with the corresponding estimates using weights adjusted for nonresponse.). Base weights are calculated for all sample members, respondents and nonrespondents alike. However, the base weights do not appear on the HSLS:09 data files, although they are used to generate response rates reported in the Data File Documentation. (See also Analytic weights, Nonresponse bias, and Nonresponse bias analysis.) Bias: Bias is the difference between the reported value and the true value. An estimate of bias is calculated as the difference between the expected value of a sample estimate (e.g., estimated mean) and the corresponding true value for the population. The true values are generally not known and must also be estimated from the data. Response bias is the difference between respondent reports and their true behavior or characteristics. Nonresponse bias is defined as the (statistically significant) difference in an estimate calculated from the respondent and nonrespondent subsets of the sample. Undercoverage bias, a type of sampling bias, arises because some critical portion of the target population is omitted from the sampling frame. For example, if the set of schools from which a school sample is drawn is incomplete or inaccurate (owing, for example, to the birth of new schools subsequent to the time the set of schools was identified, school undercoverage may occur. (See also Nonresponse bias and Nonresponse bias analysis.) Black or African American: A Black or African American person is one having origins in any of the black racial groups of Africa. The primary source of race/ethnicity categorization in HSLS:09 was respondent self-identification. Burden: Formally, burden is the aggregate hours realistically required for data providers to participate in a data collection. Burden also has a subjective or psychological dimension: the degree to which providing information is regarded as onerous may depend on the salience to the respondent of the questions that are being posed and on other factors, such as competing time demands and complexity of the information being requested. Calibration weight adjustment: This is a weight adjustment that forces survey estimates to match independent population totals for specified characteristics. Poststratification is a specific type of weight calibration that uses the cross-classification of a set of variables to form poststrata (adjustment cells). Calibration adjustments for HSLS:09 were created through a model that included individual variables and a set of interaction terms (Folsom and Singh 2000). Ceiling effect: Ceiling effect is the result of a test having insufficient numbers of the more difficult items. In a longitudinal study, ceiling effects in the follow-up can cause change scores to be artificially constrained for high-ability examinees. The measurement problems related to floor and ceiling effects in combination with regression effects found at the extreme score ranges seriously hamper the accuracy of change measures in longitudinal studies. More information (i.e., smaller error of measurement) is obtained with respect to ability level if highability individuals receive relatively harder items (and if low-ability individuals receive proportionately easier items). The matching of item difficulty to a person's ability level yields increased reliability at the extremes of the score distribution, where it is most needed for studies of longitudinal change. A strategy employed in HSLS:09 to minimize ceiling (and floor) effects is to use an array of three distinct test forms that are \"adaptive\" to the ability level of the examinee, as demonstrated in a first-stage test form common to all examinees. Multilevel testswith second stage test assignment that is based on the first stage (router) performance-minimize the possibility that ceiling effects might bias the estimates of the score gains. To further protect against ceiling effects, additional items were added to the first follow-up assessment that represented the highest levels of difficulty. (See also Floor effect and Adaptive testing.) Classical test theory: Classical test theory postulates that a test score can be decomposed into two parts-a true score and an error component; that the error component is random with a mean of zero and is uncorrelated with true scores; and that true scores, observed scores, and error components are linearly related."}, {"section_title": "Closed-ended question:", "text": "A closed-ended question is a type of question in which the data provider's responses are limited to a given set of options (as opposed to an open-ended question). (See also Open-ended question.) Cluster: A cluster is a group of sample members (or units) that is selected as one group in an early design stage. Sample members (or subsequent clusters of sample members) are then randomly selected from within the clusters chosen in the previous stage. For example, HSLS:09 clusters are schools and the sample members within the clusters are students. Examples of clusters in other studies include school districts, counties, and residential blocks. (See also Primary sampling unit.) Cluster size: The cluster size is the number of HSLS:09 sample members attending a particular study-eligible school.

Both estimates are calculated using the final analysis weights and software that appropriately accounts for the complex, two-stage sample design of HSLS:09.

The relSE is calculated as the estimated population standard error divided by the estimated population quantity. Cohort: A cohort is a group of individuals who have a statistical factor in common such as, for example, year of birth, grade in school, year of retirement, or year of high school graduation. The HSLS:09 cohort consists of ninth-grade high school students as of the fall term of the 2009-10 school year.

Disclosure coarsening techniques (such as recoding of continuous variables into categorical, top and bottom coding, and so on), suppression of variables, and data perturbation techniques (e.g., data swapping) have been used to provide disclosure protection to HSLS:09 data. (See also Data swapping and Disclosure risk analysis.) Consent, active (explicit): One variety of informed consent is called active or explicit consent. Typically, in active consent, a signed agreement to participate in a study must be obtained. In HSLS:09, permission of parents was required before students could be surveyed. Some schools required active parental consent (i.e., that a signed permission form be obtained)."}, {"section_title": "Consent, passive (implied):", "text": "Another variety of informed consent is called passive or implied consent. In more recent terminology, this consent type is called Opt-out Notification. In this model, a permission form is sent to the relevant party (in HSLS:09, the parent or guardian of the sampled student), who has the opportunity to return the form to indicate denial of permission. If the form is not returned, it is assumed that the individual has no objection to survey participation. In the HSLS:09 base year, about 80 percent of participating schools allowed passive parental consent for their ninth-grader's participation in the study. (See also Opt-out notification.) Construct: A construct is an abstract image, idea, or theory, formed from a number of simpler observable elements (e.g., socioeconomic status, or science self-efficacy). Constructs help summarize phenomena that are hypothesized to be in some important way(s) related."}, {"section_title": "Contextual data:", "text": "In HSLS:09, the primary unit of analysis is the student. Survey information collected from other study participants, referred to as contextual data, should be viewed as extensions of the student data. For example, responses provided in the school administrator, teacher, counselor, and parent questionnaires on the student's school learning environment or home situation are classified as contextual data. Counselor questionnaire: The base-year counselor questionnaire was designed to be completed by the most knowledgeable ninth-grade school counselor at the base-year school. The lead or senior-most ninth-grade counselor was targeted as the preferred respondent. The baseyear questionnaire contains items that elicit school-level data concerning counseling practices and resources, and services provided to facilitate the transition of ninth-graders into high school. For the base-year schools in which HSLS:09 students were still enrolled, the counselor questionnaire was repeated in the HSLS:09 first follow-up, with new items appropriate to ascertaining school policies that might affect the transition from secondary to postsecondary education. Coverage rate: Coverage refers to the extent to which all elements on a sampling frame are members of the population, and to which every element in a population appears uniquely on the frame. Coverage error refers to the discrepancy between statistics calculated on the frame population and the same statistics calculated on the target population. Undercoverage error can occur if target population units are excluded from the sampling frame. Overcoverage errors occur either when eligible target population units are listed more than once on the frame, or sampling frame units are erroneously classified as eligible for sampling. (See also Bias.) Critical items: Critical items are a subset of the questionnaire variables that are deemed to be of special importance. Owing to their importance, they are given a special role, so that their coverage and hence impact can be maximized. For example, critical items are overrepresented in abbreviated questionnaires, and critical item completion is used as a prime criterion for defining completed cases when only a partial interview is obtained. In addition, when a critical item is omitted in the interview, the respondent receives a special prompt, noting the importance of the item and asking the respondent to answer the question if at all possible. Cr iter ion-r efer enced measur e: A criterion-referenced measure allows its user to measure how well a student or groups of students have learned a specific body of knowledge and skills. This measure estimates what students can do and what they know on a continuum where all examinees could in theory obtain a perfect score. The HSLS:09 IRT-estimated numbercorrect scores are an example of a criterion-referenced measure of status at a point in time. For this example, the criterion is the knowledge and set of skills defined by the algebraic reasoning assessment framework and represented by the assessment item pool. In contrast, the purpose of norm-referenced tests is to rank or compare students. (See also Norm-referenced test.) Cross-cohort (or intercohort) comparison and analysis: The HSLS:09 base-year survey is not precisely comparable in timing or grade cohort definition to the prior studies, which involved spring data collections for 8th-, 10th-, or 12th-grade students. HSLS:09 cohort definition is based on a single grade (ninth grade) at a single point in time (autumn term of 2009). Although the transcripts will capture four years of high school coursetaking, because HSLS:09 has no 12 th grade freshening, HSLS:09 transcripts cannot be compared to the NELS:88, ELS:2002, and NAEP high school transcript studies. Some longitudinal intercohort comparison is possible at a higher level of generality, however-that is, not based on a specific comparison grade-that encompasses modeling the transition from high school to postsecondary education and the workforce that is the subject of all of the secondary longitudinal studies."}, {"section_title": "Cross-sectional analysis:", "text": "A cross-sectional design represents events and statuses at a single point in time. For example, a cross-sectional survey may measure the cumulative educational attainment (achievements, attitudes, statuses) of students at a particular stage of schooling, such as the beginning of ninth grade. Cross-sectional analysis in HSLS:09 can only be conducted for the base year (either at the student level or the school level). In contrast, a longitudinal study (or repeated measurement of the same sample units) measures the change or growth in educational attainments that occurs over a particular period of schooling. (See also Longitudinal or panel survey and Cross-cohort comparison and analysis.) Data swapping: Data swapping is defined in the NCES Statistical Standards (Seastrom 2003) as a perturbation disclosure limitation technique that results in a \"confidentiality\" edit. An example of a need for data swapping would be to assume that a data file has two variables which in combination constitute a disclosure risk, for example, sex and age. If a sample case needs disclosure protection, it is paired with another sampled case so that each element of the pair has the same age, but different sexes. The data on these two records are then swapped. After the swapping, anyone thinking they have identified either one of the paired cases gets the data of the other case, so they have not made an accurate match and the data have been protected. (See also Confidentiality protections.) Design effect: The design effect (deff) is a measure of sample efficiency and is the variance of an estimate accounting for the complex nature of a survey design divided by the variance of the estimate that would have occurred if a sample of the same size had been selected using simple random sampling. Historically, the deff was used to adjust a variance estimate calculated with software that could not properly account for the sample design. More recently, the deff calculated for a set of study characteristics is used to compare the sample efficiency across surveys. Sometimes it is more useful to work with standard errors than with variances. The root design effect (deft) expresses the relation between the actual standard error of an estimate and the standard error of the corresponding estimates from a simple random sample. (See also Effective sample size.) Differential item functioning (DIF): DIF exists when examinees of equal ability differ on an item solely because of their membership in a particular group (e.g., if an item favors males over females, or one racial or ethnic group over another, and cannot be explained by relevant factors such as differential coursetaking). DIF for HSLS:09 mathematics assessment items was examined in the base-year and first follow-up field tests. Items with DIF problems were revised or deleted. In both rounds, a DIF analysis was also conducted with main study data, to confirm that there were no DIF problems (none were identified). Disability: A disability is a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities (Title 42 U.S.C. Section 12102)."}, {"section_title": "Disclosure risk analysis:", "text": "This involves investigation of study data to evaluate and minimize the risk of identification of individual sample units to preserve the confidentiality of the data. HSLS:09 data have been subjected to a disclosure risk analysis to protect confidential information about individual respondents.

It began with spring high school sophomores in 2002, with follow-up studies in 2004 (with freshening to create a senior cohort), 2006, and 2012. In addition to interview data, postsecondary transcripts also are being collected (and high school transcripts were collected) for the ELS:2002 cohorts.

In essence, the effective sample size is the sample size under a simple random sample design that has the same level of precision as obtained from the complex sample design. (See also Design effect.) English language learner (ELL): ELL is a term used to describe students who are in the process of acquiring English language skills and knowledge. However, some schools use the older term \"limited English proficiency\" (LEP) to refer to such students. (See also Limited English proficiency.) File: This refers to a data file containing a set of related computerized records. Floor effect: Floor effect is the result of a cognitive test being too difficult for some examinees, causing low-ability examinees to receive chance scores on the first testing, and on subsequent testings if the test remains too difficult. Floor effects result in an inability to discriminate among low-ability individuals at time one or time two, and there will be no reliable discrimination among examinees with respect to amounts of change. One solution, used in HSLS:09, is to develop test forms that are \"adaptive\" to the ability level of the examinee, which tends to minimize the possibility of floor effects biasing the estimates of the score gains. (See also Adaptive testing and Ceiling effect.) High School and Beyond (HS&B): HS&B is the second in the series of longitudinal high school cohort studies sponsored by NCES. The HS&B base-year study surveyed sophomore and senior students in 1980. The sophomore cohort was last interviewed in 1992 and their postsecondary transcripts collected in 1993. The senior cohort was last interviewed in 1986.

The primary source of race/ethnicity categorization in HSLS:09 was respondent self-identification. Race/ethnicity was obtained for sampling purposes from administrative records provided by the School Coordinator. Hold sample: In the base year school sample, the hold sample is the additional sample of schools randomly selected for the study to guard against lower than anticipated school eligibility and response rates. These schools were included in the complete sample from which the release pools were formed. In the first follow-up, in which parents were subsampled, a hold sample was also selected for the parent survey. (See also Release pool.) Imputation: Imputation involves substituting values for missing or inconsistent data in a data set. Prediction of a missing value is typically based on a procedure that uses a mathematical model in combination with available information. Model covariates are identified from a set of variables known to be statistically and substantively related to the variable requiring imputation and the pattern of item nonresponse. Missing data for key items in HSLS:09 have been imputed."}, {"section_title": "Individualized Education Program (IEP):", "text": "An IEP is a written statement or plan for each individual with a disability that is developed, reviewed, and revised in accordance with Title 42 U.S.C. Section 1414(d)."}, {"section_title": "Individually identifiable data:", "text": "These are data from any record, response form, completed survey, or aggregation about an individual or individuals from which the identity of a particular individual (or set of individuals) may be revealed."}, {"section_title": "Institutional Contactor (IC):", "text": "An IC is a staff member who worked in the recruitment of schools for realization of the HSLS:09 sample. Item nonresponse: Item nonresponse is defined as a missing response to a particular question item on an instrument when a valid response was expected. For example, a participant did not wish to provide income information and therefore left the question item unanswered (blank). Item nonresponse is generally limited to the set of sample members who have been classified as respondents by providing, for example, responses to key questionnaire items required for analysis. (See also Nonresponse bias analysis and Unit nonresponse.) Item r esponse theor y (IRT): IRT is a method of estimating achievement level by considering the pattern of right, wrong, and omitted responses on all items administered to an individual student. IRT postulates that the probability of correct responses to a set of test questions is a function of true proficiency and of one or more parameters specific to each test question. Rather than merely counting right and wrong responses, the IRT procedure also considers characteristics of each of the test items, such as their difficulty and the likelihood that they could be guessed correctly by low-ability individuals. IRT scores are less likely than simple number-right or formula scores to be distorted by correct guesses on difficult items if a student's response vector also contains incorrect answers to easier questions. Another attribute of IRT that makes it useful for HSLS:09 is the calibration of item parameters for all items administered to all students. This makes it possible to obtain scores on the same scale for students who took harder or easier forms of the test. IRT will also permit vertical scaling of the two points in time (fall term 9th grade in 2009-10, and two and a half years later in 2012). (See also Classical test theory.) Keyfitz procedure: This is a statistical procedure for efficiently maximizing sample overlap. A Keyfitz procedure was used to augment the HSLS:09 nationally representative sample for state-level public school estimation in a subset of the states. Limited English proficiency (LEP): LEP is a concept developed to assist in identifying those language-minority students (individuals from non-English language backgrounds) who need language assistance services, in their own language or in English, in the schools. (See also English language learner.) Locale codes: In earlier NCES secondary longitudinal studies, locale codes have been referred to as metropolitan status or urbanicity codes (for example, urbanicity trichotomized into three values-urban, suburban, or rural). The former codes were metro-centric (that is, based on metropolitan statistical areas). The HSLS:09 locale codes, however, use NCES's new urbancentric codes. The new urban-centric locale codes follow the same logic as the older locale codes, but incorporate an approach that prioritizes population size and proximity to an urbanized area in assigning locale. The highest level (four terms) of the new locale code system was used in HSLS:09 school sampling to create substrata (with geography as superstrata). The four major categories are city (large or mid-size city), suburban (urban fringe of large or mid-size city), town (large or small), and rural (outside or inside a Core-Based Statistical Area). Although HSLS:09 uses only the four major or highest categories, each of the four categories is further subdivided in the NCES geocode scheme (for example, \"town\" comprises three statuses in relation to an urbanized area: fringe, distant, or remote from an urbanized area). Longitudinal or panel study: In a longitudinal design, similar measurements-of the same sample of individuals, institutions, households, or of some other defined unit-are taken at multiple time points. HSLS:09 employs a longitudinal design that follows the same individuals over time and permits the analysis of individual-level change. (See also Cross-sectional analysis.) Microdata (microrecords): These are observations of individual sample members, such as those contained on the HSLS:09 public use and restricted use data files. Mode effects: Mode of administration effects can sometimes present difficulties for surveys. Typically the HSLS:09 questionnaires were administered in two modes: selfadministration (via web) and interviewer administration (via web-based computer-assisted telephone interview [CATI] or laptop-based computer-assisted personal interview [CAPI]). (Although the mode of administration differs, the instruments are identical.) The concern is that sometimes (and in particular when perceived social desirability of questionnaire responses is a salient consideration and the item is administered by an interviewer) respondents may respond differently to the different stimuli provided by differing administration modes. However, format differences also can lead to mode effects, as when a question benefits from visual cues that cannot be duplicated in a telephone interview. For this reason, every effort was made in HSLS:09 to adapt questions so that differences between modes would be minimized. National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP): NAEP is a cross-sectional assessment program that measures achievement at the group level for students in 4th, 8th, and 12th grades and provides a time series for measuring trends in academic progress of 9-, 13-, and 17-year-olds. The HSLS:09 assessment differs from but complements those of NAEP by providing a basis for measuring individual-level achievement growth between fall of 9th and spring of (modal)11th grade in mathematics (with a focus on algebraic reasoning) and relating cognitive gains in this subject to the individual, school, and family factors and processes that are measured in the various HSLS:09 questionnaires. NAEP also conducts high school transcript studies however, the NAEP transcript collections are based on high school seniors, the HSLS:09 transcript study will be based on fall term 2009 9 th graders in schools with both a 9 th and 11 th grade.

Given this definition, HSLS:09 does not represent all ninth-grade students, since schools with grade spans such as K-9, 6-9, 7-9, 8-9, and so on, were ineligible for the study. Noncoverage: Noncoverage is defined as target population members that have been excluded from the sampling frame population. (See also Coverage rate.) Nonresponse bias: Nonresponse bias may occur as a result of not obtaining 100 percent response from the selected cases. More specifically, nonresponse bias occurs when the population parameter estimated from the respondent data deviates from the population parameter. The potential magnitude of nonresponse bias is estimated as the product of the nonresponse rate and the difference in values of a characteristic between respondents and nonrespondents. (See also Nonresponse bias analysis.) Nonresponse bias analysis: Nonresponse bias analysis compares the characteristics of respondents and nonrespondents. Both unit nonresponse (school and student) and item nonresponse on questionnaires were subject to bias analyses in HSLS:09. For example, certain key data items were obtained in the base year for both responding and nonresponding schools, so that a school nonresponse bias analysis could be conducted, and bias in school-level estimates quantified and tested. Nonsampling error: This is an error in sample estimates that cannot be attributed to sampling fluctuations. Such errors may arise from many sources including unit or item nonresponse across subgroups or errors in the respondent data such as through a student's keying error. Nor m-r efer enced test: A norm-referenced test is used to rank or compare students or groups of students relative to each other. It is interpreted based on comparison of an examinee's performance relative to the performance of others in a specified reference population, or by a comparison of a group to other groups. The base-year weighted quintile score and the theta scores are examples of norm-referenced scores in the HSLS:09 mathematics assessment. (See also Criterion-referenced measure.) Occupational Information Network (O*NET): O*NET is the primary industry and occupation coding scheme used in HSLS:09. The O*NET database was developed for the U.S. Department of Labor and represents an extensive set of worker attributes and job characteristics. O*NET provides a nested coding structure: 23 general-level categories expand to 96 mid-level categories that can be expanded further to 821 specific-level categories."}, {"section_title": "Office of Management and Budget, U.S. Executive Branch (OMB):", "text": "OMB is a federal agency with the responsibility for reviewing all studies funded by executive branch agencies. OMB reviewed, commented on, and approved the HSLS:09 questionnaires, and all study components including the sample design. Open-ended question: This is a type of question in which the data provider's responses are not limited to given alternatives. Opt-out notification: Opt-out notification is more commonly known as passive consent or as implied consent. In HSLS:09 base year, about four-fifths of schools agreed to \"opt-out notification\" in which parents or guardians were required to sign and return a form only if they refused to permit their child to participate in the study. Written parent permission-sometimes known as active or explicit consent-was required by other schools. In this case, no student could participate in the research who lacked a signed parental consent form. Oversampling: Oversampling is the deliberate sampling of a group (subpopulation) within the target population at a higher rate than the proportion exhibited in the population. For example, Catholic schools and other private schools were oversampled. Asian ninth-grade students were oversampled within schools to ensure sufficient sample to conduct analysis. Parent/guardian questionnaire: The base-year HSLS:09 parent component sought to collect information from parents/guardians of all base-year student sample members. Unlike the base year, the first follow-up HSLS:09 parent component comprised a subsample of parents. For both base year and first follow-up, the parent or guardian most knowledgeable about his or her student's educational experience was asked to complete the questionnaire. Population variance: This is a measure of dispersion defined as the average of the squared deviations between the population values and the mean of those population values.

Probability sample: A probability sample is a subset of the target population selected by a random mechanism using a fixed and predetermined probability of selection for each unit (i.e., each population unit has a known, nonzero chance of being included). Proficiency score: Proficiency scores (or criterion-referenced mastery scores) are based on clusters of items that are of similar content and difficulty. Mathematics proficiency scores are reported in HSLS:09 and reflect such skills as, for example, understanding proportions or demonstrating an understanding of linear functions. Public-use data file: A public-use file includes data that have been coded, aggregated, or otherwise altered to mask individually identifiable information. This file is available to the public through NCES. Unique identifiers, geographic detail, and other variables that cannot be suitably altered are suppressed in public-use data files. Public-use edits are based on an assumption that the public may have access to both individual respondent records and secondary data sources that include data that could be used to identify respondents. For this reason, the editing process is relatively extensive. When determining an appropriate masking process, the public-use edit takes into account and guards against matches on common variables from all known files that could be matched to the public-use file. The analysis used to determine which records require masking is called a disclosure risk analysis. (See also Restricted-use data file and Disclosure risk analysis.) Questionnaire-incapable students: It was determined that, as in past surveys, some students could not be validly assessed or surveyed (even with accommodations) owing to severe physical, mental, or emotional limitations, or because of language barriers. These students were classified as \"questionnaire-incapable\" students but they were not deemed ineligible for the study. Contextual information was collected for these students including responses from some but not all parents, school administrators, teachers, and counselors, and they were given positive weights as applicable (student, parent, teacher, etc.).

Item response rates are calculated as the weighted ratio of the number of respondents for whom an in-scope response was obtained to the number of respondents who are asked to answer a given item. More detailed information can be found by consulting NCES Standard 1-3 in the NCES 2002 Statistical Standards document (Seastrom 2003). Bias analyses conducted when response rates are below targets help to assess any possible limitations to the generalizability of survey estimates. (See also Nonresponse bias analysis.) Restricted-use data file: A restricted-use file includes individually identifiable information that is confidential and protected by law. The basic strategy for HSLS:09 publicversus restricted-use file construction was to include the variables with limited disclosure treatment on the restricted-use file, and to modify or suppress values for these same variables on the public-use version.

The student sampling frame was equivalent to the ninth-grade enrollment lists (rosters) provided by the HSLS:09 sampled schools. The sampling frame population is the set of elements associated with this list. As with every survey, the sampling frame is constructed in an attempt to enumerate every member of the target population. Differences between the sampling frame and target populations are linked to coverage errors. (See also Bias, Coverage rate, and Target population.) Sampling variance: Sampling variance is the variation associated with the set of estimates generated from (theoretical) repeated implementation of the essential survey conditions (sample design, frame, sample size, instrument, data collection methodology, etc.).

These values are greater than zero and, in general, less than or equal to one. Selection probabilities equal to zero are only (theoretically) associated with ineligible sampling frame units. Serpentine sorting: Serpentine sorting is a method of sorting in which records are ordered in an alternating ascending and descending pattern, so that any two consecutive records in the sorted file are more similar with respect to their values on the sort variables than in traditional sorting. This method was used in various HSLS:09 statistical procedures such as with the weighted hot-deck imputation methodology."}, {"section_title": "Session Administrator (SA):", "text": "The SA is a member of the field staff in charge of conducting in-school data collection sessions, including proctoring of the assessment.

Session Administrator Assistant (SAA): The SAA is a member of the field staff working under the direction of a session administrator to conduct in-school data collection sessions. Simple random sampling (SRS): SRS uses equal probability sampling with no strata or clusters. The HSLS:09 sample is stratified and clustered. Standard statistical analysis software assumes SRS and independently distributed errors. For studies such as HSLS:09, special variance estimation software (such as SUDAAN, WesVar, AM, Stata, or R) is required to compute (Taylor Series) linearization or replication variance estimates. The HSLS:09 restricteduse data files contain linearization weights and balanced repeated replication weights ) are available on all files.

SES is a social status construct represented by an index in HSLS:09 that takes account of the student's home background as represented by parent's education, parent's occupation, and family income. Two SES measures are available on the data files, both in continuous form as well as weighted quintiles. The first HSLS:09 SES index is similar to measures employed in NELS:88 and ELS:2002. A second version of the SES index was created for HSLS:09 that includes a covariate adjustment based on school urbanicity (city, suburban, town, or rural locale). In this alternative version of the SES composite, urbanicity is accorded a role as a factor that differentially affects the impact of education, occupation, and income on relative social position."}, {"section_title": "Sojourn:", "text": "The HSLS:09 base year and first follow-up included a computerized assessment of students conducted on school computers when possible. When school computers were not compatible with RTI's computerized assessment, RTI-provided laptops were used in their place. When school computers were compatible and a computer lab at the school was available, RTI used a custom Linux distribution called Sojourn to launch the survey and mathassessment software. Using Sojourn allows for a high degree of interoperability with hardware based on i486-compatible processors, creates a controlled testing environment, and secures the computer against key loggers, viruses, or other malicious code. This ensures that any sensitive information entered by the student is not compromised. Speededness: One dimension of the assessments involves the question of whether the test was speeded. A common two-part rule of thumb (Rock and Pollack, 1991) for determining whether a test is speeded is as follows. A test is considered to be unspeeded if nearly all testtakers reached the three-quarters point of the test, and at least 80 percent of the students answered the last item (in the test or in their form). While in principle the HSLS:09 assessments need not be time-limited, in practice, for practical reasons time constraints were imposed for almost test administrations and therefore the question of speededness is a legitimate one. Standard deviation: This is the square root of the population (unit) variance used in, for example, the calculation of the standardized theta score in the mathematics assessment. Standard error: This is the square root of the population sampling variance. It is a measure of the dispersion of the sampling distribution of a statistic. Standard errors are used to establish confidence intervals for the statistics being analyzed and are constructed using the final analysis weights and software that accounts for the complex HSLS:09 sample design."}, {"section_title": "Standard error of measurement (sem) for theta (or standard error of estimation):", "text": "For the assessment, the standard error of measurement (sem) for each student's theta score is calculated from the sum of item information functions for all items answered by that student. The standard error of measurement is a transformation of the test information function. The precision of parameter estimates can be computed as a function of the reciprocal of the measurement error, or the variability of repeated estimates of the value of the parameter. More specifically, the standard error of measurement is computed from the reciprocal of the square root of the test information function. (See also Test information function.) Statistical significance: Statistical significance is the finding (based on a derived probability, rather than a certitude) that, for example, two or more estimates are truly different from one another and not a merely apparent difference reflecting chance variation. Stratification: Stratification is the division of a population into distinct, mutually exclusive and exhaustive subgroups (strata). Strata are generally defined to include relatively homogeneous units on characteristics that are of interest to the study. Stratification is used to reduce sampling error. In HSLS:09, the first-stage strata were formed and schools were selected independently within each stratum. Students were independently selected within strata defined by race/ethnicity. Student questionnaire: This is one of the two parts of the HSLS:09 base-year and first follow-up student survey (the other part is the algebraic reasoning assessment). The student questionnaire contained a locator section for tracing sample members for future waves of HSLS:09 and a series of questions about school and home environments, time use, attitudes, values, expectations, and aspirations. In the first follow-up, the branching of the student questionnaire accommodated out-of-school statuses such as dropping out or change to a homeschooling environment, as well as in-school (base-year school or transfer school) statuses."}, {"section_title": "Study-eligible school:", "text": "Base-year study-eligible schools are generally defined as U.S. schools (public or private) that provide educational instruction to 9th-and 11th-grade students and distribute high school diplomas based on a preset list of criteria. Note that schools with a grade span that did not include 11th grade were excluded from the eligibility pool, and that the base year therefore does not represent all 9th-grade schools or all 9th-grade students. (See also Target population.) Study-eligible student: All ninth-grade students enrolled in study-eligible schools on the Survey Day in the fall semester of the 2009-10 school year were classified as study eligible This set includes students identified as questionnaire incapable and students who were able to complete all components of the study. All foreign exchange students were excluded from the study. (See also Survey Day.) Survey Day: This is a day chosen by the school coordinator during the data collection period when a session administrator and assistant oversaw the computerized administration of the survey to the school's sample of students. Make-up days were normally offered for students who missed Survey Day."}, {"section_title": "Target population:", "text": "Target population is defined as the elements identified for a particular study. The weighted results tabulated from the HSLS:09 data provide estimates for target populations and population domains. In HSLS:09, the base-year target population was fallterm 9th-graders in all regular public and private schools with 9th and 11th grades in the 50 states and the District of Columbia."}, {"section_title": "Taylor series linearization:", "text": "The Taylor series variance estimation procedure is used to estimate the variance of linear statistics (e.g., estimated totals) and nonlinear statistics (e.g., proportions or ratios). For nonlinear statistics, the procedure takes the first-order Taylor series approximation of the nonlinear statistics and then substitutes the linear representation into the appropriate variance formula based on the sample design. Because HSLS:09 is a stratified multistage survey, the Taylor series procedure requires analytic strata and analytic primary sampling units, defined from the sampling strata and primary sampling units (HSLS:09 schools). (See also Balanced repeated replication.) Teacher (contextual) sample: In the HSLS:09 base year, as applicable, two teacher reports were sought for each student, one from the student's fall-term mathematics teacher and one from the student's fall-term science teacher. However, some students were not enrolled in the target subjects, or were not enrolled at the time of the survey (owing to block scheduling or other special arrangements). There was no teacher survey in the first follow-up. Teacher questionnaire: In the base year, mathematics and science teachers of HSLS:09 sampled students were asked to complete a teacher questionnaire. This instrument was used to collect data on school and teacher characteristics (including teacher qualifications and experience) and some classroom-level information. Unlike the NELS:88 and ELS:2002 teacher surveys, no direct teacher ratings or evaluations of specific sampled students were sought and the names of the sampled students were kept anonymous."}, {"section_title": "Technical Review Panel (TRP):", "text": "A TRP is a specially appointed, independent group of substantive, methodological, and technical experts who offer advice to the study contractor on issues of study design and content. TRP members are nominated by RTI and approved by NCES. Typically TRPs are convened prior to and subsequent to a field test. Test infor mation function: The test information function provides a visual representation of the measurement accuracy of the theta estimates across the range of ability levels. A transformation of the test information function provides the standard error of measurement (sem) of the ability estimate (theta). Unit nonresponse: Unit nonresponse is the failure of a survey unit (e.g., at the institutional level, a school, or at the individual level, a respondent, such as a student or a teacher) to cooperate or complete a survey instrument. Overall unit nonresponse reflects a combination of unit nonresponse across two or more levels of data collection, where participation at the second stage of data collection is conditional upon participation in the first stage of data collection. In HSLS:09, overall nonresponse is the product of school-level nonresponse times student nonresponse. Total item nonresponse reflects a combination of the overall unit nonresponse and item nonresponse. (See also Item nonresponse and Nonresponse bias.) Validity: Validity is the capacity of an item or instrument to measure what it was designed to measure, stated most often in terms of the correlation between scores in the instrument and measures of performance on some external criterion. It is the extent to which a test or set of operations measures what it is supposed to measure. Reliability, on the other hand, refers to consistency of measurement over time. (See also Reliability.) Variance estimation: Variance estimation is the measure of the variability of a statistic and includes the standard error and error variance. Two procedures for estimating variances of survey statistics in HSLS:09 are the BRR (balanced repeated replication) and Taylor series. BRR (available on both the public-use and restricted-use files) is recommended for HSLS:09 data. (See also Balanced repeated replication and Taylor series linearization.) Wave: A wave is a single implementation of the survey within the larger longitudinal survey (e.g., the base year and each successive follow-up are each waves of data collection). Weighted estimates: Weighted estimates (are survey estimates generated from survey data that have been statistically weighted (multiplied) by factors reflecting the sample design. The general purpose of weighting is to compensate for unequal probabilities of selection into the sample and to adjust for the fact that not all schools or individuals selected into the sample actually participated. (See also Analytic weights.) White: A White person is one having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa.

The focus of the study is to understand the impact of the high school experience on students' learning and their education and career choices, and also to explore the transitions students make from high school to postsecondary education, the labor force, and adult roles. One distinctive feature of HSLS:09/12 is that the same students will be followed over time, regardless of the path they take (for example, those who have left school, those who go directly into the military or work force after high school, and those who are college-bound). The other distinctive feature is that in addition to surveying and testing students, information will be gathered from parents, school administrators, and counselors to better understand the many home, school, peer, and community influences on students' development and choices. While all education and career choices are of interest, additional information will be collected about science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) coursetaking and career preparation."}, {"section_title": "When is the study being conducted?", "text": "The initial data collection occurred in the fall of 2009.

(Public Law 107-279, Section 183). The data collected will be used in analyses to understand students' coursetaking patterns, motivation and achievement, and how students decide what to do after high school. We sincerely appreciate your help in preparing for the session at your school and in ensuring that HSLS:09 is a success. Information collected from students, parents, counselors, and school administrators will help to create policies and programs designed to improve the quality of math and science education in the U.S, increase our global competitiveness in math and sciencerelated fields, and improve the overall high school experience. Each school's participation is critical to the success of the study, and reports will not identify participating districts, schools, students, or individual staff. We think the best way to learn about students' school-related experiences, decisions, and plans for the future-is by asking the students themselves! Therefore we're asking you to complete a computerized questionnaire which will help educators and policy makers understand your needs and interests better. We're also assessing the level of academic achievement of students in the United States so that effective programs and services for future high school students can be developed-so we'll be asking you to complete a computerized mathematics assessment too! You'll complete the student questionnaire first and then fill out the mathematics assessment-it will take no more than 90 minutes total. All of the information you give us will be strictly protected and your teachers, school, and parents will never know how you answered. The math assessment will not affect your grades-in fact, no one at the school will ever see your scores! [DO NOT READ IF STUDENTS ARE NOT ALLOWED TO RECEIVE THE $10] When you have finished both the assessment and questionnaire, [IF INCENTIVE PERMITTED, USE APPLICABLE PHRASING: I will give you $10/I will give you a $10 gift card/your school will receive $10 for each participating student] as a thank you for your participation. Your participation in HSLS:09 is voluntary, and you don't have to answer any questions you don't want to. Your answers will be used for statistical purposes only and will be combined with other students' responses for things like statistical reports to Congress. Your answers won't be disclosed, or used, in identifiable form for any purpose unless otherwise compelled by law (Public Law 107-279, Section 183). We are also asking your principal, school counselor and one parent or guardian to complete a questionnaire. This will help provide contextual information such as school programs and practices. In about a year, you will be contacted again about participating in another follow-up to this study. Therefore we'll be asking you to provide contact information today so that we will be able to get in touch with you then. When you first log in, you will be asked to complete a questionnaire. When you finish the questionnaire or after 35-minutes, you will see a series of instructions for the math assessment which are also printed on the scratch paper that you received. This test contains 40 multiple-choice mathematics items separated into two parts. You will have 15 minutes for part 1 and 25 minutes for part 2. For each item: Read the item carefully and try your best to identify the correct answer from among the four choices. If you can eliminate at least one answer, you are encouraged to guess the answer. You will not lose any credit for guessing when you aren't completely sure of the answer. Use scratch paper if necessary. To answer a question, click on the answer you think is correct. Then click on the Next button to move on to the next item. You may use a scientific calculator for any item on this test. If you do not have a calculator of your own, you may use the online calculator by clicking on the Show Calculator button. If time permits, you will be able to return to the questions that you have skipped or marked for review at the end of each section. You each received a card with a unique user ID and password to log into the questionnaire and math test. Please enter that now. [Wait here: Assist students that have trouble entering their passwords] This will take you to the \"Welcome\" screen where you will see instructions for completing the questionnaire. If you need help, raise your hand and I will assist you. You may now begin. We understand that your school is unable to participate in the student component of the first follow-up study and we respect your decision. However, it is important that we collect follow-up data from each of the schools that participated in 2009. For that reason, we ask that you complete an administrator questionnaire. >> HSLS:09 seeks to understand the impact of the high school experience on students' learning and their education and career choices, and explores the transitions students make from high school to further education, the labor force, and adulthood. HSLS:09 is being conducted by RTI International for the U.S. Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). We are asking you to complete a 30-minute questionnaire to provide your insight into the administration and policies at your school. To access the questionnaire, the web address and your unique study ID and password are provided above. The questionnaire's first three sections mainly request factual information about your school and its programs and can be answered by you or a designee who is able to provide this information. The final section asks for subjective reports on the school climate, and we ask that this section be completed by the principal only. If someone other than you completes the initial portion of the questionnaire, please let us know so that we can give that person their own log-in credentials. Data collected are used only for statistical purposes and may not be disclosed or used, in identifiable form for any other purpose except as required by law (Public Law 107-279, Section 183). The data collected will be used by researchers, educators, and policymakers to understand students' coursetaking behaviors, motivation and achievement, and how students decide what pathways to follow during and after high school. Information collected from students, parents, teachers, counselors, and school administrators will help to inform and shape efforts to improve the quality of the high school experience, including math and science education in America. The first follow-up to the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009 (HSLS:09) is now underway and we understand that at least one student selected for HSLS:09 is currently enrolled at your school. HSLS:09 seeks to understand the impact of the high school experience on students' learning and their education and career choices, and explores the transitions students make from high school to postsecondary education, the labor force, and adulthood. HSLS:09 is being conducted by RTI International for the U.S. Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics (NCES).

By contrast, three continuous variables were identified for a modelbased methodology referred to as multiple imputation (MI): (1) the student ability estimate in mathematics (theta), (2) the standard error of measurement (sem) for theta, and (3) socioeconomic status (SES)."}, {"section_title": "H.2.1 Mathematics Ability Estimates (theta and sem)", "text": "Among the 20,594 students who responded to the questionnaire, 89.9 percent (unweighted) or 18,507 students answered a sufficient number of assessment items to calculate both theta and sem. The scoring algorithm used to generate theta and sem is discussed in section 2.3. A set of five imputed values for each variable was generated from a single model for the remaining 2,087 students using SAS\u00ae PROC MI. Both theta and sem were imputed simultaneously within one model to ensure consistency of their values. Highlights of the MI methodology for these variables are provided in section 7.4.1. Table H-10 contains the covariates retained for the theta/sem MI model. Only covariates associated either with theta and sem calculated from the 18,507 student records or with the pattern of item nonresponse exhibited in the data were retained for the final MI model, in keeping with the methodology used for the HSLS:09 base year. The five imputed values for theta and sem are contained in the HSLS:09 first follow-up variables X2TXMTH1-X2TXMTH5 and X2TXMSEM1-X2TXMSEM5, respectively. The average of the five values (X2TXMTH and X2TXMSEM) is used along with the analysis weights to estimate the population values with appropriate software. Note that records with calculated scores that did not require imputation will have this value replicated within the five variables.

One index (X2SES) was calculated with a formula that is equal to the definition used in other NCES studies. The second index (X2SES_U), a slight variant, accounts for differences in the target population by the locale of the base-year school (X1LOCALE). Details of the formulae and the MI methodology are given in section 7.4.2. In the discussions below, the term \"SES\" refers to both definitions. Among the 20,919 responding students or responding parents, 10,079 students were included in the parent survey subsample. SES was calculated for 83.2 percent (unweighted) or 8,383 parents using information provided in the parent questionnaire. This number included 7,490 records where SES was calculated from respondent data and 893 records with SES computed from responses plus one to three (single-value) imputed variables (see table 68 in section 7.4.2). As with theta and sem, a set of five imputed values was generated from a PROC MI model for 12,536 students. This number included 1,696 students in the parent survey subsample (238 students with insufficient parent responses plus 1,458 students with a nonresponding parent or 8.1 percent unweighted) and 10,840 students (51.8 percent unweighted) not selected for the parent survey subsample (see table 68 in section 7.4.2).
