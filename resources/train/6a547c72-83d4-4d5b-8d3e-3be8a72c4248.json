[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Since 2000, the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) has provided evidence on students, schools, and education systems that contributes to the discussion and fuels the debate on educational issues around the world. The data provided by PISA offer ample opportunities to look at different issues related to education, including student achievement, motivation, learning strategies, family socio-economic characteristics, teaching practices, school climate characteristics, and school organisation practices to name some. These educational issues can be analysed across schools, countries, and increasingly over time (i.e. multiple PISA cycles). In order to gather and produce information on such a rich number of educational aspects at a large scale, PISA requires a complex study design in relation to sampling and test design, for example, that is handled at the analysis stage with advanced statistical techniques. The PISA study design has significant strengths but also limitations.\nThe current special issue deals with limitations and opportunities for improvement of the PISA study design. Particularly, articles use PISA data to analyse and discuss methodological issues related to sampling eligibility, linking errors in trend estimation of student achievement at national levels, item position effects in the PISA test, causal inference with cross-sectional data, and cross-cultural comparability of non-cognitive constructs.\nThe articles by LeRoy, Samuel, Deluca, and Evans (2018) and Spaull (2018) look at the issue of sampling eligibility in PISA in relation to students with special educational needs (SEN) and the out-of-school population in developing countries, respectively.\nLeRoy et al. (2018) discuss the challenges and problems that occur in PISA for including students with SEN related with (a) student participation, (b) assessment methodology, and (c) reporting results. As regards to student participation, two ways for improving the inclusion of students with SEN are mainly discussed. The first is through reducing the variability in exclusion and inclusion rates, and the second (an even more important method) is through adopting a uniform, standardised system for recognising and classifying special education conditions/needs. The research community, and those who are responsible for the design of international studies, may find the suggestions provided in this paper very helpful in their attempt to propose more discrete categories of disability on the Student Tracking Form (STF); it is suggested this could be done by extending the SEN classifications to the following five categories: Physical, Sensory, Intellectual, Behavioural, and Language Literacy On the topic of assessment methodology, the authors discuss policy issues related with test accommodations and how the lack of a concrete policy (since PISA does not officially allow or monitor test accommodations) affects the participation of students with SEN. It is argued that the STF should point out which students receive accommodations in"}, {"section_title": "", "text": "their current educational programs and identify if those students will use the same accommodations to participate in PISA. Concerning the reporting of results, it is pointed out that the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) controls access to SEN data and that no standard formats exist for SEN reports within OECD/PISA. Two types of reports are recommended: a stand-alone report on the access, performance and perceptions of students with SEN, and a set of presentations on SEN findings inserted in continuing PISA reports. The second type of reporting gives emphasis to equity in education, which should be the focus of both the educational research community and policy makers aiming to promote quality and equity in their educational systems (Kelly, 2012; Kyriakides, Creemers, & Charalambous, 2018) .\nThe article by Spaull (2018) deals with the consequences of not taking into account the population of 15 year-olds that is out-of-school or severely delayed in the PISA sampling frame. The sample eligibility criterion in PISA generally covers the majority of the 15-yearold population in developed countries but not in developing countries, where a significant part of the population is out-of-school or delayed. Spaull (2018) proposes a methodology that combines PISA and household surveys to take into account access to education and quality of learning outcomes when measuring student achievement and making international comparisons. The methodology is illustrated for the case of Turkey, where about one-third of the target age population was out-of-school in PISA 2003 and therefore not represented by PISA. Turkey is also a country where the percentage of the population eligible for PISA has increased over time as access to education has expanded and inefficiencies in the system have reduced. Findings reveal that performance of 15 yearolds is overestimated in PISA reports when sampling eligibility is not taken into account. The percentage of students in Turkey reaching functional literacy levels is almost half of the figure presented in the PISA 2003 report. As expected, discrepancies between PISA reports and figures corrected for sampling eligibility with the approach proposed by Spaull (2018) reduce over time as the percentage of the target age population covered by PISA increased after 2003. The paper rightfully cautions about making generalizations and comparisons between countries, particularly between developed and developing countries, without taking into account access to education, and proposes a methodology that can be extended to other countries and to the study of not only overall performance but also gaps (eg. gender, SES) corrected for sampling eligibility.\nThe articles by Nagy, Nagengast, Frey, Becker, and Rose (2018), Robitzsch and L\u00fcdtke (2018), and von Davier et al. (2019) deal with the validity of achievement scores in PISA. Nagy et al. (2018) examine item position effects and whether they vary by characteristics of students and schools. Evidence shows that the probability of responding to test items correctly typically decreases as items are located towards the end of the test due to fatigue and persistence effects. The study of position effects is highly relevant for assessing the validity of student scores. Item position effects are a threat to the validity of test scores if we agree that student proficiency should reflect item difficulty and student ability and not additionally test-taking persistence or motivation effects. As the authors point out, one could argue that high stakes problems in real-life demand full effort and persistence. If that is the case, we need to be aware that position effects in PISA scores introduce bias. Nagy et al. (2018) used data from the German extension of PISA 2006 to analyse the size and pattern of position effects as well as the variability of position effects across students, academic subjects, and school tracks in Germany. The results show that position effects measured by the decline in test scores from the first to the last position in the test are stronger for reading than mathematics and that position effects differentially affect students and schools. Particularly, position effects are stronger for male students, students from lower socio-economic backgrounds, and students with migration backgrounds. That is, reported achievement gaps in PISA studies related to gender, socio-economic status (SES), and migration background would look different if we take into account position effects. For example, gender gaps in favour of male students (eg. mathematics and science) would be larger and gaps in favour of female students (eg. reading) would reduce if we adjust results for position effects. Similarly, students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds and students with migration backgrounds will perform better than currently observed. As such, position effects may have relevant implications for the study of equity and social mobility across countries with PISA data. The authors encourage researchers to clearly establish whether test-taking persistence should be regarded as relevant variance in proficiency constructs or whether position effects are a threat to validity. They also advocate for evaluating options that take into account position effects in the design of the PISA test. Robitzsch and L\u00fcdtke (2018) and von Davier et al. (2019) are concerned with linking across assessment cycles and the validity of trend estimates in PISA data.\nThe article by Robitzsch and L\u00fcdtke (2018) looks at linking errors in analyses of trends in national student performance with PISA. Increasing availability of multiple PISA cycles makes it possible to examine trends in national performance. The analysis of trends is highly relevant to evaluate education policy but is faced with linking errors in addition to sampling and measurement errors. A set of common items is administered across PISA cycles in order to align scores over time on a same scale. Linking errors measure the extent to which trend estimates depend on the selected set of common items across assessments. Robitzsch and L\u00fcdtke (2018) propose a framework for assessing linking errors in international assessments. The framework assumes linking errors emerge from differential item functioning across countries, across assessments, and across countries and assessments. Variance components models are employed to derive standard errors for trend estimates. The authors use a simulation study to compare the standard error with their formula and the one used by PISA that only takes into account differential item functioning of items across assessments at the international level. Further, the authors re-analyse trends in reading performance between PISA 2006 and 2009 using their approach and compare it with PISA results. The results show that the method used by PISA up until now underestimates the uncertainty of the linking errors. The authors emphasise the need to incorporate uncertainty caused by differential item functioning across countries in the calculation of standard errors and the importance of increasing the number of common items in order to obtain reliable country comparisons and trend estimates. The approach proposed by the authors contributes to the discussion of analysing linking errors in PISA.\nvon Davier et al. (2019) evaluate IRT scaling and linking methods employed in PISA and provide an alternative approach for linking student achievement data over time that goes beyond linking at aggregate levels. The proposed approach flexibly handles measurement invariance by considering item-by-group interactions in concurrent analysis of combined assessment datasets with IRT unidimensional models that reduce model complexity. The approach illustrated with data from five PISA cycles (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) (2011) (2012) allows tracking the behaviour of items over time and across subpopulations without compromising comparisons across cycles and over time based on prior results produced with the PISA traditional approach. The approach by von Davier et al.\n(2019) holds promises for establishing stronger links across PISA cycles with greater measurement precision and can be extended to investigate measurement invariance across delivery modes (e.g. computer-based vs. paper and pencil).\nThe article by Marchionni and Vazquez (2018) explores the causal effect of an extra year of schooling on mathematics achievement for seven Latin American countries based on data from PISA 2012. The authors used both sharp and fuzzy Regression Discontinuity (RD) methods to search for exogenous variation in students' birthdates around the school entry cut-off date. They found strong effects of this extra year of schooling in most participating countries, which differ significantly from the typical estimated effects obtained from simple regressions or multilevel models. Since laws and regulations in the different countries establish that children with a specific age by a certain date must register in the first year of primary education, differences in learning outcomes between students with almost the same age occur and the RD approach is applied well. While it is impossible to manipulate the date of birth near the cut-off point, it is essential that the causal effect of an extra year of schooling on test scores can be isolated by comparing the achievement of students born just before and just after the school cut-off date (e.g., Kyriakides & Luyten, 2009 ). The results have essential implications for the PISA sample design since it is imperative to take into account the effects of school entry cut-off dates on PISA samples to avoid making imbalanced international comparisons or at least to make the analogous adjustment of average scores for the purposes of international comparisons. The results of this paper can also be seen as the starting point for conducting further studies for searching for variation of the schooling effect at the school level. This aim can be achieved through employing multilevel techniques in analysing the data of international comparative studies such as PISA and searching for variation at school level in the effect of schooling. One could even search for factors that may explain this variation at school and/or even at the district/ content level. It is finally important to note that the secondary analysis of PISA 2012 presented in this paper is one of the few studies which raise the importance of using appropriate advanced quantitative techniques in analysing data of international (crosssectional) studies to search for cause and effect relations (Creemers & Kyriakides, 2015) .\nThe articles by Marksteiner, Kuger, and Klieme (2018) and He, Barrera-Pedemonte, and Buchholz (2018) deal with cross-cultural comparability issues of non-cognitive PISA data. Extensive research has examined measurement invariance across cultures of student achievement but less evidence is available for other constructs measured in international assessments. Efforts towards improving cross-cultural comparability in PISA are very valuable in light of existing evidence showing inconsistent results explained by lack of cross-cultural comparability in construct items (eg. positive association between student motivation and student achievement at student level and negative at country level). Marksteiner et al. (2018) analyse the potential of anchoring vignettes for improving cross-cultural comparability of non-cognitive student data. PISA has used anchoring vignettes in student questionnaires. Anchoring vignettes are brief descriptions relating to different levels of performance (eg. low, intermediate, high) on a construct of interest (eg. achievement motivation, student-oriented teaching) exhibited by hypothetical individuals (eg. students, teachers). Ratings of students on these descriptions can be used as standards to adjust self-reported responses for different interpretations of identical questions across cultures ex-post. Marksteiner et al. (2018) use student-organisation-related data from the PISA 2015 field trial for 51 countries to evaluate and compare the reliability of anchored and non-anchored data. Reliability analysis included measurement invariance, internal consistency, and exploratory factor analysis for scale dimensionality whenever internal consistency was low. The results showed that anchoring might be less effective than expected. Anchoring led only to small increases in model fit indices of measurement invariance tests that were insufficient to warrant desired scalar invariance levels. Anchoring also led to small improvements in internal consistency and did not change the factor structure substantially. One important contribution of the study was the inclusion of language comparisons in measurement invariance analysis in addition the country comparisons. Interestingly, results showed that language differences contribute more to cross-cultural bias than country differences. For PISA, this means that greater effort needs to go into translating and adapting instruments across countries with different languages. He et al. (2018) evaluated measurement invariance in overlapping motivational constructs surveyed in PISA and the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS): instrumental motivation, enjoyment of science, and sense of belonging at school. Student selfreported data for these constructs were collected in PISA 2015 and TIMSS 2015 for 29 countries participating in both studies, providing a unique opportunity to cross-validate measurement invariance analysis across surveys. The authors analysed measurement invariance across countries in both surveys using multigroup confirmatory factor analysis (MCFA) and compared factor scores from MCFA and IRT scaling by looking at correlations with student achievement by country. Measurement invariance results provided support for metric invariance across surveys, that is, they provided support for correlation analysis using these motivational constructs. MCFA and IRT scores were highly correlated, indicating consistency of measurement across methods. Correlation analysis between motivational constructs and student achievement revealed similar patterns across surveys. Scalar invariance was not reached in either study, suggesting that mean comparisons of motivational scales across countries may be flawed. The consistency of results with TIMSS data contributes to strengthen the validity of measurement invariance analysis with PISA alone.\nAltogether, the articles in this special issue provide valuable evidence and recommendations for evaluating and improving PISA methods in relation to sampling, crosscultural comparability of constructs, measurement of student achievement over time, and the analysis of causal inference with cross-sectional data."}]
