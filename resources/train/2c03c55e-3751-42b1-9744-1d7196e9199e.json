It was expected that was influenced by coupled ocean-atmosphere phenomenon in the tropical Pacific Ocean and the tropical Indian Ocean. Previous studies have found that during dry season precipitation in Indonesia region has high correlation with the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) events [1] [2] [3] . The ENSO is one major mode of climate variability that takes place in the tropical Pacific Ocean [4] . Meanwhile, the IOD is a coupled ocean-atmosphere phenomenon in the tropical Indian Ocean that has strong impact on the Indian Ocean rim countries [5, 6] . A positive IOD is characterized by low sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly in the southeastern tropical Indian Ocean (off west Sumatra and south Java) and high SST anomaly in the western/central tropical Indian Ocean, associated with southeasterly (easterly) wind anomalies along the coast of Sumatra and Java (equator). As a consequence of change in the ocean-atmosphere circulation is an excess precipitation over the east Africa, India, and southeast Asia, and deficit precipitation over the Indonesian region and Australia [7] [8] [9] . The purpose of this study is to analyze the dynamical evolution of drought event in the Indonesian region during 2015 associated with those two climate modes."}, {"section_title": "Data and Method", "text": "This study used three datasets, namely precipitation, SST, and low-level wind (850 mb). The precipitation data were obtained from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) with horizontal resolution of 0.25\uf0b0 \uf0b4 0.25\uf0b0 (https://mirador.gsfc.nasa.gov/). The data are available from January 1998 until present. The SST data were from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)'s Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature (OISST) Version 2 (https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/). The data are available from September 1981 until present, having horizontal resolution of 0.25\uf0b0 \uf0b4 0.25\uf0b0. Meanwhile, the low-level wind data were from the ERAInterim of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) with a constant horizontal resolution of 0.5\uf0b0 for period of January 1979 until present (http://apps.ecmwf.int/datasets/data/).\nMonthly value of the Nino3.4 index and the Dipole Mode Index (DMI) were used to represent the evolution of two types of climate mode in the Indo-Pacific region. The Nino3.4 index is defined as an average SST anomaly in the equatorial Pacific Ocean bounded by 5\uf0b0N to 5\uf0b0S and 170\uf0b0W to 120\uf0b0W [4] . Meanwhile, the DMI which is defined as a difference in SST anomaly between western the tropical Indian Ocean region (10\uf0b0S to 10\uf0b0N and 50\uf0b0E to 70\uf0b0E) and its eastern region (0\uf0b0S to 10\uf0b0S and 90\uf0b0E to 110\uf0b0E) [5] . Note that, the anomalies of all variables are defined as the deviation from the monthly climatology over a period of 2001-2015."}, {"section_title": "Result and Discussion", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Evolution of ENSO and IOD events 2015/16", "text": "We first calculated the SST anomaly based on Ni\u00f1o3. "}, {"section_title": "Spatial Patterns of Precipitation during El Ni\u00f1o/Positive IOD 2015/16", "text": "Precipitation over the Indonesian region is generally decreased during 2015/16 (Figure 2 ). This condition associated with the El Ni\u00f1o and positive IOD events are concurrently occurred [10, 11] . The significant negative precipitation anomalies first appeared over Sumatra, Kalimantan, and Papua Islands in July 2015. This drought condition continued and reached its peak in September-October In November 2015, while the positive IOD has decayed, the positive precipitation anomalies were observed in northern part of Sumatra, northeastern part of Kalimantan, west Java, and northern Papua Islands. However, the drought condition in southeastern Papua Island was persisting until the peak of El Ni\u00f1o event in January 2016. It is interesting to note that the intensity of negative precipitation anomalies in this area was higher during the peak of positive IOD and approach the peak of El Ni\u00f1o events (September and December 2015)."}, {"section_title": "Ocean-Atmosphere Interaction in the Indo-Pacific Region", "text": "In order to explain the severe drought condition in Indonesian region during 2015/16, we evaluated the ocean-atmosphere interaction in the Indo-Pacific region. Figure 3 shows the spatial patterns of SST and horizontal wind anomalies in the Indo-Pacific region. The negative precipitation anomalies over the Indonesian region associated with negative SST anomalies in the Indonesian seas, eastern tropical Indian Ocean and western tropical Pacific Ocean. During the El Ni\u00f1o and positive IOD events, the Indonesian seas experienced cooling phase. The most striking feature was observed during the maturing phase of the positive IOD. Meanwhile, the warmer SST anomalies was observed in the western tropical Indian Ocean and in the eastern to central tropical Pacific Ocean. The cooling effect of SST anomalies in Indonesian Seas and the warming effect of SST anomalies in the western tropical Indian Ocean and the eastern to central tropical Pacific Ocean have caused divergence wind originated from the Indonesia area. Therefore, the strong westerly wind anomalies were observed in the western tropical Pacific Ocean and strong southeasterly wind anomalies were observed in the eastern tropical Indian Ocean. This divergence circulation causes a descending atmospheric motion over the Indonesian region leading to a suppressed convection. As the positive IOD event terminated, the western Indonesian seas started to warm (Figure 3d )."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "The severe drought condition in the Indonesian region during 2015/16 is caused by the El Ni\u00f1o and positive IOD events that simultaneously occurred. The precipitation anomalies in the Indonesian region decreased drastically in dry season and continued until wet season. This condition is associated with SST and horizontal wind anomalies in the tropical Pacific Ocean and the tropical Indian Ocean. During the dry season, the SST in the Indonesian seas and its surrounding water was anomalously negative. Meanwhile, positive SST anomalies have covered the western (eastern) tropical Indian (Pacific) Ocean. This caused a divergence winds over the Indonesian region, leading to a descending atmospheric motion and a suppressed convection."}]
