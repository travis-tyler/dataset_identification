[{"section_title": "", "text": "JR Schement, MA Tate Institute for Information Policy 03/08/13 2 The Americans never use the word peasant, because they have no idea of the class which that term denotes; the ignorance of more remote ages, the simplicity of rural life, and the rusticity of the villagers have not been preserved among them; and they are alike unacquainted with the virtues, the vices, the coarse habits, and the simple graces of an early stage of civilization -Alexis de Tocqueville 1 There is hardly a pioneer's hut which does not contain a few odd volumes of Shakespeare. I remember reading the feudal drama of Henry V for the first time in a log cabin. --Alexis de Tocqueville 2 De Tocqueville traveled throughout central Pennsylvania observing, with the eye of a French aristocrat, the peculiarities of American society. He peered into the lives of ordinary farmers and noted with some surprise the rejection of second class status in matters of democratic participation by even the most remote settler. Those backwoods farmers saw themselves as integral to the life blood of the nation as any wealthy Boston trader or Philadelphia merchant. And now, into the 21 st century, that insistence persists; thus motivating our concern for equal access-rural and urban-within an age of rapid technological change, media convergence, and increasing dependence on new channels of communication. In this paper, we examine the conditions under which ten rural counties experience the information age. The paper presents a statistical description of the information infrastructure in each county (five counties in North Dakota and five in Pennsylvania), with the goal of providing a framework for the development of policy research agendas seeking to identify and serve the information needs of rural America. The policy basis for the analysis stems from the strong stance taken by Congress in support of rural access, as expressed in section 254 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. That is, in the United States, regardless of whether individuals reside in the middle of Philadelphia or amidst the Badlands of North Dakota, they are entitled to connect, if they so wish, to the nation's telecommunications and information infrastructure. Specifically, \"access in rural and high cost areas\" is one of the guiding principles underlying \"... the preservation and advancement of universal service:\" Consumers in all regions of the Nation, including low income consumers and those in rural, insular, and high cost areas, should have access to telecommunications and information services, including interexchange services JR Schement, MA Tate Institute for Information Policy 03/08/13 4 largest portion of the populace concentrated in two major metropolitan areas-Pittsburgh and Philadelphia. Nevertheless, the state's rural population is sizable; Pennsylvania includes 2,567 municipalities, ranking 6th 4 among the states and proof of the persistence of rural community life. Then and now, Pennsylvania contains one of the largest rural populations in the country with 15.4% of the population living in nonmetro counties in 2000 5 ; and, especially in the eastern half of the state, many of its small towns are the same ones recorded in the census of 1790. Population growth trends for the two states differ markedly. North Dakota's rural areas have experienced continued out-migration while the majority of Pennsylvania's rural areas have been experiencing population growth. As a window into the rural future, an appreciable amount of Pennsylvania's rural growth can be attributed to the emergence of a \"commuter society\" wherein individuals and families who formerly resided in New York City or Philadelphia, for example, relocate their residences to rural areas while keeping their jobs in the city (Yes, some Pennsylvania residents commute to New York City on a daily basis.). No such growth pattern seems likely in North Dakota given the spread of rural population beyond its metropolitan areas; especially since metropoles in North Dakota all number less than 100,000 inhabitants (i.e., Bismarck 55,532;Fargo 90,599;Grand Forks 49,321;Minot 36,567)."}, {"section_title": "Table 1", "text": "North Dakota and Pennsylvania: Selected Characteristics North Dakota Pennsylvania Population, 2001 estimate: 634,448 Population, 2001 estimate: 12,287,150 Land area: 68,976 square miles Land area: 44,817 square miles Home to two large U.S. Air Force bases (Grand Forks AFB (AMC) and Minot AFB (ACC)) Home to numerous public and private universities and colleges Significant American Indian population (4.9%) Relatively few other minority inhabitants (0.6% Black or African American persons) 14.7% of population, 65 years or older 10% Black/African American population 15.6% of population, 65 years or older billion); egg production ($265 million); broiler production ($203 million); and, turkey production ($92 million). The North Dakota and Pennsylvania counties selected for this study qualify as rural under most, if not all, of the definitions of rural accepted by the U.S. government (See Appendix J for the many definitions of \"rurality.\"). Data from the following counties make up the body of the study. \u2022 North Dakota: Benson, Divide, McIntosh, Ramsey, Sioux. \u2022 Pennsylvania: Bradford, Clinton, Forest, Potter, Sullivan. All of these counties share the designation rural. However, the counties of North Dakota represent some of the least densely populated counties in the United States, with the exception of Alaska, while the Pennsylvania counties represent some of the most densely populated rural counties in the country. Table 1 provides a brief introduction to the contrasts between North Dakota and Pennsylvania (See tables offering further comparisons of the these counties in appendix XXX.). If there is a salient fact to keep in mind while reading this paper, it is that population dispersal confronts public institutions, from telecommunication firms to public libraries, with the problem of high delivery costs due to the great distances between homestead and small towns. In one way or another, beginning with demographics, all of the information structures and telecommunications deployments discussed reflect this one maxim.  In the Information Age, rural Americans must achieve access to the national information infrastructure (NII), in order to realize the promise of democracy and share the good life; indeed, for rural citizens who live geographically isolated from the seats of government, access to telecommunications channels may well offer the only opportunity to participate in political discourse. Equally, America's economy depends on information networks to distribute economic goods and services; and, as such, the economic benefits of an interconnected NII accrue to all of the individuals on the network. Furthermore, access to communication services available from the NII offers benefits in a broad cultural sense; that is, Americans experience a high standard of quality of life precisely because they can communicate and retrieve information in order to make a wide range of life enhancing choices. When residents of rural communities enjoy access, they and society benefit meaningfully; but, when some experience geographic isolation, compounded by telecommunications services of quality lower than those in cities, the potential for alienation grows and all of society suffers. With these caveats in mind, we describe the range of information assets available to residents of these counties."}, {"section_title": "Newspapers", "text": "As small newspapers lose out to big papers, and as conglomerates shut down the small town press, North Dakota and Pennsylvania remain the exceptions. North Dakota has 10 total daily newspapers, while Pennsylvania has 84 7 . The relatively high incidence of newspaper readership correlates with the older average age of North Dakotans and Pennsylvanians, since older individuals are more likely to read newspapers. Americans enjoy an abundance of information about themselves but fall short when it comes to ease of use. As we took on this project, we discovered that within the constraints of our time and budget we would be unable to generate the desired data for these ten counties. Though we explored numerous sources, both public and private, some categories of data require more resources than available to us. As a result, we have drawn upon data at the state and national level. JR Schement, MA Tate Institute for Information Policy 03/08/13 10 universal access is to become a reality, institutions of the public sphere, especially libraries, must provide Internet connectivity to those individuals unable to link to the Internet from their homes. 291,900 Pennsylvanians and 63,996 North Dakotans are unserved by libraries. However, according to Pennsylvania's Office of Commonwealth Libraries, all of the Pennsylvania counties included in the current study are served by at least one public library, and in many instances the counties are served by three or more public libraries (i.e., Bradford County (9); Clinton County (3); Potter County (5) 10While Pennsylvania is home to 457 public libraries compared to North Dakota's 81 libraries, North Dakota boasts 3.76 volumes per population served while Pennsylvania offers only 2.47 volumes. In North Dakota, 13 bookmobiles serve populations living some distance from the state's public libraries whereas Pennsylvania has 33 bookmobiles serving its more remote patrons.

Lack of telephone service creates a significant barrier to job searching, access to public services, health and safety, as well as one's general contributions to society. After all, if someone lives without a television or a radio, their choice might be interpreted as a charming social rebellion or the adoption of an idiosyncratic lifestyle; but when a person lacks access to a telephone, he or she is functionally isolated. For rural populations, the telephone plays a vital role in the health care, business, and social spheres. When rural populations use telephone lines to access the Internet, its value in everyday life increases yet further. Thus, telephone service acts as one's passport to the economy, to social networks, and to political discourse. A review of the national factors contributing to lack of a household telephone indicates that rural households without phones comprise multiple but overlapping groups: \u2666 Income makes a difference. E.g., Households receiving energy assistance, food stamps, school lunch programs, welfare, and public assistance tend to have lower telephone penetration rates, as much as 20 points below the national average. \u2666 Housing characteristics influence telephone penetration. E.g., renters experience on average a lower telephone penetration level than those owning their dwelling. The difference in telephone penetration between owner-and renter-occupied housing units (OHUs) at the state level was no less than 3.8% (Hawaii) and was as much as 17.5% (Arkansas). In 19 of the 50 states, owner OHUs had a telephone penetration level at least 10% higher than their renting counterparts. \u2666 Women as heads of households experience phonelessness in inordinate numbers. The Census category, \"Single Civilian Female with Children\" has the second lowest telephone penetration (82.6%), exceeded only by the homeless. In addition, this category has shown little improvement, 80.1% in 1984 to 82.6% in 1993. [Can these statistics be updated?] [Is this also true in these counties?] \u2666 Youth suffers as well. Younger households suffer lower telephone penetration levels than do households headed by older people. (What are the data, if any, for these counties?) \u2666 Unemployment directly affects telephone penetration. All groups experienced lower penetration among the unemployed at the national level; compare Whites with Indians. In general, we can say that there is a strong correlation between income and telephone penetration, but income does not operate in a vacuum; other factors compound or lessen the income effect (such as renting a housing unit). We can note that households receiving any kind of government assistance fall below national telephone penetration levels. Likewise, women heads of households with children fare poorly.   (2002 ed.). Note: Grade A service indicates \"satisfactory service expected at least 90% of the time for at least 90% of the receiving locations whereas Grade B service indicates \"the quality of picture expected to be satisfactory to the median observer at least 90% of the time for at least 50% of the receiving locations within the contour. In the absence of interfering co-channel and adjacent channel signals\" (1999 ed., p. A-15). Few, if any, of the counties in the study serve as a home base for commercial television stations 14 although four of the counties are home to two or more AM and/or FM radio stations (See Table  7.). Pennsylvania counties such as Bradford, Clinton and Sullivan also have an advantage over many of their North Dakota counterparts in the study in regards to television and radio broadcasting since they are located within the listening/viewing area of metropolitan stations located in the general region. For example, most Bradford County residents can readily receive radio and television broadcasts from Elmira and Binghamton NY, Wilkes-Barre Scranton, PA and so forth. In some instances, such as in Potter County, residents living in the higher elevations of the county can also receive Canadian television broadcasts. In the case of North Dakota, television stations \"serving\" rural counties studied here are solely retransmissions from stations serving Bismark or other larger cities in the state. Concerns over a lack of diversity of ideas in rural America are well taken. Rural residents in these counties may find themselves limited to a retransmission station that does not carry local information. And, while satellite relayed channels offer an expanded menu of information for those who can afford the service, local information remains confined to a weekly newspaper.   Bowker.

Indeed, only one system in North Dakota had more than 1,000 subscribers (i.e., Devils Lake, Ramsey county). Midcontinent Communications owns 5 of the 7 North Dakota cable systems in the counties studied. Only one of the seven systems was operating \"2 way\".   24 county has 13 channel capacity. In the last half century, a significant slice of Pennsylvania's rural population has become exurban; thus, where proximity to metropolitan centers allows for economical cable system expansion, merging towns have benefited. Still, in the state that pioneered cable service for the rurally isolated, the attractiveness of urban profit margins renders rural service unappealing to providers. 15"}, {"section_title": "Internet", "text": "In North Dakota, 47% of households do not own a computer and 54% do not have Internet access\" which they also note is below the national averages of \"... 43% and 49% respectively.\" Moreover, \"71% of households in North Dakota earning less than $15,000 per year do not own a computer and 75% do not use the Internet at home\" compared to the national average \"... of 77% and 82% respectively\" (Children's Partnership, 2002).

Moreover, \"... 80% of households in Pennsylvania earning less than $15,000 per year do not own a computer and 83% do not use the Internet at home\" (Children's Partnership, 2002). In general, North Dakota and Pennsylvania lag behind national averages though not by a major percentage spread. It would seem that the lag in North Dakota occurs in the rural counties, since they do not possess much in the way of access. For Pennsylvania, the stories differs a bit. The inner cities of Pennsylvania's two large metropoles also lag behind the state average; here it would appear that rural communities suffer lack of access comparable to the inner cities.  30, 2002.

As the CERA page notes, The CERA concept builds on the roots of small towns in the West balancing their independence with mutual support for the common good. CERA is an effort to test the hypothesis that creating a network of small rural towns deploying affordable, high speed telecommunications services will result in increased job creation and/or income in those towns while also improving access to education, healthcare, and governmental services. The technologies deployed will enable citizens in these towns to pool their collective talent that can be utilized in an extended workplace situation and market that pool of talent to corporations. In addition, with the high speed telecommunications capabilities in place, the participating towns will focus on improving access to health, education, and government services to take full advantage of the installed infrastructure and may share services and expertise among the towns over the network as well. Several new telecom initiatives have also been recently announced in Pennsylvania to supplement a number of other ongoing projects. Given the relatively recent nature of these endeavors, however, it is still somewhat early to judge their effectiveness in providing additional telecom access to rural populations in both states. Nevertheless, the concept of cooperatives has long and deep roots in rural America; and, because cooperatives succeed by aggregating demand, they offer the potential for overcoming the longstanding loss of population. 17"}, {"section_title": "Connectivity, Capability, and Content-The Determinants of Rural Access", "text": "The provision of telecommunications services will not by itself guarantee participation for rural citizens. The other side of the equation requires an understanding of the tools an individual must acquire to gain full access to the national network: that basket of tools encompasses connectivity, capability, and content. \u2666 The basic step toward access requires connecting to the network, often assumed to be the home. Connectivity, however, is not so simple; the cost of information technologies ranging from the telephone to Internet-ready PCs remains beyond the means of many households. 18 Furthermore, even when a household earns disposable income sufficient to purchase connectivity, geography may still impose a barrier; significant tracts of rural America lack the infrastructure necessary for Internet access, must pay long-distance charges to connect, or receive access inferior to that enjoyed by their city cousins. In such climates, public libraries offering connectivity fulfill a critical need. Yet, several of these counties are poorly served, if at all, by public libraries. \u2666 In the information age, capability consists of traditional literacy, and informational literacy. These are often assumed to be part of the skills kit that youngsters develop on their own; the teenage geek with a computer reigns as one of America's most visible cultural icons. However, the validity behind this myth comes from the ready access to computers enjoyed by middle class urban youth. In rural areas, informational literacy is harder to come by as part of the growing up experience, and may not be compensated for in formal schooling. \u2666 Ultimately, the value of access comes down to the content available to the individual user. Indeed, the very abundance of information available today poses a paradox -with so much, why is it so difficult to find the answer to a specific question? Furthermore, superabundance does not provide all with equal access."}, {"section_title": "The Fork in the Road", "text": "One question continues to trouble us. Do rural communities experience a tipping point when information and telecommunications assets fall below some undetermined level? That is, as the information and telecommunications infrastructure declines, it becomes harder to attract new businesses and industries, because they need that infrastructure. With fewer new businesses and industries locating in the area, it becomes harder to create new jobs. And, without new jobs, young adults seek their fortunes elsewhere. Eventually, urban travelers will find themselves, \"passin' towns that have no name.\" 19 Thus, out-migration becomes it own curse. Once the information and telecommunications infrastructure falls below its level of self sustenance and sets in motion a spiral of decline, can these processes be reversed? After all, the rise of the information society and economy locates the infrastructure that supports it at center stage; so that, as it falls, it drags everything else down with it. At this juncture, when many rural communities face cloudy futures, policy makers and researchers should pursue an agenda that JR Schement, MA Tate Institute for Information Policy 03/08/13 29 clarifies the conditions that lead to irreversible decline. In an era when the potential of information and communication technologies exceeds our collective imaginations, to stand by while rural communities fade away reflects willful blindness at best or at worst gross negligence. De Tocqueville saw the future when he observed capability and content in the log cabins that he visited. Today, though capability, content (and connectivity) vary considerably from household to household, community to community, the goal remains the same-they must be achieved for all, if all are to realize the promise of the information age. categories, resulting in a 10-part county codification. The scheme, originally developed in 1975, was updated in 1983and slightly revised again in 1988(September 19, 2002. As shown in Table A-1, the revised scheme allows subdivision of county data into finer residential groups, beyond metro and nonmetro. This flexibility is particularly useful for the analysis of trends in nonmetro areas that are related to population density and metro influence (USDA, September 19, 2002). Furthermore, according to the USDA: all U.S. counties and county equivalents are grouped according to the official metro status announced by OMB in June 1993, when the current population and commuting criteria were first applied to results of the 1990 Census of Population 20 . Metro counties are further distinguished by the population size of the Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) of which they are a part, with counties in MSA's of 1 million or more classified as central or fringe counties. Nonmetro counties are classified according to the aggregate size of their urban populations. Within the three urban size categories, counties adjacent to an MSA are identified. Adjacent counties (1) are physically adjacent to one or more MSA's, and (2) have at least 2 percent of the employed labor force in the nonmetro county commuting to central metro counties. Nonmetro counties that do not meet the above criteria fall into the \"not adjacent\" category (USDA, September 19, 2002). At present, the overall rural-urban continuum code scheme includes 813 metro counties and 2,288 nonmetro counties 21 (USDA, September 19, 2002 (USDA, September 19, 2002). 21 In Virginia, independent cities are combined with their counties of origin (USDA, September 19, 2002 4 Urban population of 20,000 or more, adjacent to a metro area. 5 Urban population of 20,000 or more, not adjacent to a metro area. 6 Urban population of 2,500 to 19,999, adjacent to a metro area. 7 Urban population of 2,500 to 19,999, not adjacent to a metro area. 8 Completely rural or less than 2,500 urban population, adjacent to a metro area. 9 Completely rural or less than 2,500 urban population, not adjacent to a metro area. Note. From \"Measuring rurality: Rural-urban continuum codes\" by U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, Economic Research Service, September 19, 2002, [Washington, DC] Urban influence codes 22 are yet another methodology employed by the USDA to measure the economic impact of an urban area upon surrounding rural areas. According to the USDA (August 13, 2002): An area's geographic context has a significant effect on its development. Economic opportunities accrue to a place by virtue of both its size and its access to larger economies. And, access to larger economies-centers of information, communication, trade, and finance-enables a smaller economy to connect to national and international marketplaces. These relationships among economies are basic concepts of the central place theory commonly studied in regional economics. Population size, urbanization, or access to larger communities are often crucial elements in research dependent on countylevel data sets. To further such research, we have developed a set of county-level urban influence categories that captures some differences in economic opportunities. The USDA (August 13, 2002) describes the resulting codes as follows (see Table A-2): The urban influence codes divide the 3,141 counties, county equivalents, and independent cities in the United States into nine separate groups. Metropolitan counties are divided into two groups by the size of the metro area-those in \"large\" areas with at least 1 million residents and those in \"small\" areas with fewer than 1 million residents. Nonmetro counties are divided into groups by their adjacency to metro areas-adjacent to a large metro area, adjacent to a small metro area, and not adjacent to a metro area. Nonmetro counties adjacent to either size metro area are further classified by the size of their \"own city\"-those containing all or part of a city of 10,000 or more residents and those containing no part of a city that large. Nonmetro counties not adjacent to a metro area are divided by the size of the largest place they contain-those containing all or part of their \"own city\" of 10,000 or more residents, those containing all or part of a \"town\" of 2,500-9,999 residents, and those containing no part of a town with at least 2,500 residents (putting the entire county in the Census Bureau's definition of \"rural\"). Census-defined places are considered to be cities or towns in this classification. 23 Like their rural-urban continuum code counterparts, urban influence codes group metro and nonmetro counties according to the official metropolitan status announced by the OMB in June 1993, derived from population and commuting data from the 1990 Census of Population 24 . Nonmetro counties are considered adjacent if they are adjacent to a metro area and have at least two percent of employed persons commuting to work in core county(ies) of the metro area. In cases where a nonmetro county met the adjacency criteria to more than one metro area, it was designated as adjacent to the metro area to which the largest percentage of its workers commuted. Currently, according to the USDA (August 13, 2002), there are 836 metro counties, of which 311 are part of large metro areas and 525 are part of small metro areas. There are 2,305 nonmetro counties. Of the 186 nonmetro counties that are adjacent to large metro areas, 63 have their own city. Another 815 nonmetro counties are adjacent to small metro areas, 188 of which have their own city. Of the 1,304 nonmetro counties that are not adjacent to a metro area, 234 have their own city, 555 have a town, and 515 are rural. As the USDA points out, \"Not all the metro areas are completely surrounded by adjacent counties. Some counties abutting metro areas do not meet the 2-percent commuting requirement to be considered \"adjacent.\" Others have more commuting to a metro area of the other size, and so are classified as adjacent to the other area. Some of the urban influence groups are concentrated in particular census divisions. Most concentrated are the rural nonadjacent counties-41 percent are in the West North Central division."}, {"section_title": "Table 2", "text": "Urban Influence Codes"}, {"section_title": "Code Description Metro counties:", "text": "1 Large-in a metro area with at least 1 million residents or more. 2 Small-in a metro area with fewer than 1 million residents.

Goldsmith proposed modifications to the OMB's definitions of \"metropolitan\" and \"non-metropolitan\" areas in order to more precisely differentiate rural sections of Large Metropolitan Counties (counties with at least 1,225 square miles) that most likely do not have easy access to central urban market areas 25 . As a result, Goldsmith's definition uses census tracts to identify rural areas in Large Metropolitan Counties. To identify parts of Large Metropolitan Counties that are Isolated Rural Areas, Goldsmith used the following methodology: \u2022 The designation of Large Metropolitan Counties (LMC's) as counties with at least 1,225 square miles. Not surprisingly, these counties are located principally in the West, including Alaska. \u2022 The designation of Rural Areas in large metropolitan counties as census tracts with: \u2022 no persons living in central areas (a city of 50,000 or more persons plus the surrounding densely settled suburbs, i.e. urbanized areas) \u2022 no persons living in cities of 25,000 or more persons \u2022 The exclusion of census tracts with large institutional population or no population from the analysis. Census tracts with large institutional population are defined as tracts with 75 percent of the population or more in institutional or group quarters (such as a prison or hospital). In addition, Goldsmith defines Isolated Rural Areas as: \u2022 Rural Areas (census tracts) in which less than 15 percent of the population commuted to work in the central area (operationally, a city of 50,000 or more persons plus the surrounding densely settled suburbs) or \u2022 Rural Areas (census tracts) in which more than 15 percent of the population commuted to work in the central area, if 45 percent of the labor force commuted 30 minutes or more to work. It should also be noted that rural areas (census tracts) located in Ranally Metropolitan Areas (RMA's) were not considered Isolated Rural Areas. Goldsmith's definition offers several advantages over the Census Bureau's and OMB's definitions. One primary advantage is that Goldsmith's version does not \"... assume that all residents of the county have easy geographical access to services in central areas. The OMB definition of \"metropolitan\" counties does not reflect the fact that some residents of small-town and open-country parts of Large Metropolitan Counties are in a similar position to residents of non-metropolitan counties, i.e. have limited geographical access to services concentrated in the central areas of metropolitan counties.\" In addition, the definition of isolated rural areas has helped \"improve the operational definition of 'rural areas' for federal programs . Finally, Goldsmith's definition uses the census tract--a relatively small geographic area-to more precisely identify rural portions of metropolitan counties (Cromartie and Swanson 1996)."}, {"section_title": "Frontier Area Designations (FEC) (Frontier Education Center)", "text": "The last delineation of rurality to be discussed in the present paper is the Frontier Education Center's \"Frontier Area\".
