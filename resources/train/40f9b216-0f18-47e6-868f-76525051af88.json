Larger farms have competitive advantages over smaller farms in most commodities, refl ecting economies of size in farming. Nevertheless, about 800,000 of the 2.2 million U.S. farms in 2007 were small commercial farm operations. Their total production-$65 billion in 2007-was greater than the total agricultural production from all farms in the Corn Belt States.\nProduct mix. Small commercial farms have a product mix distinctly different from that of larger farms: small commercial farms focus on commodities that do not necessarily require a full-time commitment of labor-poultry, beef (generally cow/calf or stocker enterprises), hay, and grain/soybeans. High-value crops (vegetables, fruits and tree nuts, and nursery and greenhouse products) and dairy play a minor role in farm production on small commercial farms, but make up 44 percent of production on very large farms (GCFI of at least $1 million)."}, {"section_title": "Farm fi nances.", "text": "Average small-farm fi nancial performance lags well behind that of large farms, suggesting that production will continue to shift to larger operations. Financial performance among small farms varies, however, and many are quite profi table. Other small farms, particularly very small ones, will remain in business in spite of fi nancial losses because their operators have other sources of income and operate the farm for reasons other than profi t.\nHousehold income and wealth. Small-farm households depend heavily on off-farm income, and the nonfarm economy is important to them. Because of their off-farm income, median household income for small-farm households is comparable with the median income for all U.S. households. Farm households, regardless of the size of their farms, tend to have a high net worth, with their farms accounting for most of that value. Ninety-four percent of farm households in 2007 had a net worth equal to or greater than the median for all U.S. households.\nLongrun changes. The number of very large farms grew rapidly between 1982 and 2007, according to the census of agriculture, while the number of small commercial farms declined. The share of sales by very large farms also grew substantially, from 27 to 59 percent. The 2007 census reported more noncommercial farms than prior censuses, and they now account for well over half of all farms. The increase in noncommercial farms, however, coincides with greater efforts by the USDA to count all small farms in the census.\nThe future? Because larger farms realize higher-than-average fi nancial returns and because many operators of small commercial farms are over 65 years old-especially those with GCFI of less than $100,000-competitive forces will likely continue to reduce the number of small commercial farms and shift production to larger farms.

According to the 2007 Census of Agriculture, nearly 2 million farms-91 percent of all U.S. farms-are small, based on the National Commission on Small Farms' defi nition of \"small\" as a farm with less than $250,000 in sales (USDA, National Commission on Small Farms, 1998, p. 28) .\nThis farm diversity is due, in part, to the way farms are defi ned. A farm is defi ned by the USDA as a place that produces or could produce $1,000 of sales, including income from Government payments. A property with less than $1,000 in sales could still be classifi ed as a farm if it had enough acreage of various crops or head of livestock to generate $1,000 of sales. These places are called \"point farms,\" and their numbers have grown sharply. 1 In the 2007 census, point farms accounted for 31 percent of all farms, up from 11 percent in the 1982 census.\nWhile the number of point farms increased, the number of small commercial farms continued to decline as production shifted to larger farms.

The ARMS sample, which includes 20,000-24,000 farms in each year's data, covers all types of farms and is designed to accurately represent farms and production in the continental United States. The census includes all farms and is carried out every 5 years. 2 ARMS collects detailed data about farm business fi nances and the farm operator's household, tying them to information about farm production and resources. The census forgoes the detailed fi nancial and demographic data collected in ARMS, focusing instead on more detailed information about the physical production of crop and livestock commodities. The census is also useful in following long-term trends, since it dates back to 1840, while ARMS has been in use only since 1996.

Sales measure production in dollars, rather than the level of one input (land)."}, {"section_title": "Measuring Sales", "text": "There are several ways to measure farm sales, and the measures vary along three dimensions:\nWhose revenue to include.\n\u2022 We can focus on the revenue of the farm business or the revenue accruing jointly to a combination of the farm business and to two stakeholders: share landlords and production contractors. 3 Share landlords rent land to farmers and receive a share of farm production as rent. Contractors hire farmers to grow livestock (and, less often, crops) for a fee; the contractor receives the commodity at the end of the production stage and handles its sale. All three entities-the farm business, share landlords, and contractors-receive a share of the revenue generated by the production and sale of the farm's commodities.\n\u2022 The sources of revenue to include.

In some analyses, we expand GCFI to gross farm income (GFI), which adds three noncash items to GCFI: the change in inventories, 5 the value of farm commodities consumed on the farm, and the imputed rental value of the farmhouse.\n3 Farms typically enter into two types of contracts. A production contract is a legal agreement between a farm operator and another person or fi rm (contractor) to produce a specifi c type, quantity, and quality of agricultural commodity for the contractor, who owns the commodity being produced and pays the farm a fee for producing the commodity. Under a marketing contract, the contractor buys a known quantity and quality of a commodity from a farm for a negotiated price. The farm owns the commodity while it is being produced and receives a price that refl ects the value of the commodity. 4 GCFI focuses on the farm business, excluding returns to share landlords and contractors. It includes all farm-related revenue, not just crop and livestock sales, and is based on annual sales, not the value of annual production. 5 Inventory change in ARMS includes changes in accounts receivable and changes in the values of crop, livestock, feed, and fertilizer inventories."}, {"section_title": "Gross Farm Sales", "text": "GCFI differs from gross farm sales, which focuses on the revenues from all commodities produced on the farm.

GCFI may exceed gross sales if the farm business has no production contracts, but engages in other activities that generate other farm-related income.\nGCFI may be much less than gross farm sales for farms with production contracts. Commodities removed under production contacts are excluded from GCFI, but are included in gross farm sales. GCFI does include the fees received by farmers from contractors for the services they provide-labor, housing, and management-but these fees are usually a small share of the value of commodities removed. In these cases, GCFI is a more accurate indicator of the amount of economic activity carried out by the farm business. For farms with production contracts, the amount of economic activity carried out by the contractor can be extensive, including the provision of feed, young animals, and veterinary services in the case of livestock."}, {"section_title": "Market Value of Agricultural Products Sold", "text": "Gross farm sales is closely related to a measure used in the census of agriculture: the market value of agricultural products sold. These census data are useful because they have been collected for many years and allow for longterm comparisons.

Using GCFI makes a difference, however, in the case of poultry farms: 87 percent are classifi ed as small with GCFI, double the share classifi ed as small using gross farm sales.\nMost poultry farms are small businesses that feed a large number of birds owned by contractors. For example, contract broiler producers-who are provided with feed and chicks by integrators-receive contract fees that may amount to only 16 percent of the value of the poultry removed (MacDonald and Korb, 2006, p. 18) .

We chose GCFI because it is the most complete measure of the revenues received by the farm business. GCFI includes farm business income from all sources-sales of commodities, Government payments, and other farm-related income-while excluding income received by landlords and production contractors. Regardless of the level of GCFI, most farms are family farms (defi ned by ERS as farms where the majority of the business is owned by the operator and individuals related to the operator). Ninety-eight percent of all farms in the United States are classifi ed as family farms, as are 84 percent of very large farms.

Specifi cally, 54 percent of all farms are noncommercial (GCFI of less than $10,000), but they account for just 1 percent of the total value of production. At the other end of the size spectrum, 40,800 very large farms (GCFI of over $1 million) account for only 2 percent of farms, but 47 percent of production. Large farms (GCFI of $250,000-$999,999) account for 7 percent of farms and 30 percent of the value of production.\nSmall farms with substantive agricultural production must be evaluated separately from those with very little production. We defi ne small commercial farms as those with a threshold level of sales-GCFI of at least $10,000. While substantially outnumbered by the 1.2 million noncommercial farms in the United States in 2007, there were still 800,000 small commercial farms (36 percent of all farms). They held 41 percent of farmland, accounted for 22 percent of production, and provided virtually all of the 23-percent share of total small-farm production. 7 The number of small commercial farms has shrunk over time, as has their share of U.S. farm production (Hoppe and Banker, 2006, pp. 7-9) . Their total production remains quite large, coming in at $65 billion for 2007, or 16 percent more than total agricultural production in the Corn Belt. 8 Small commercial farms produced nearly twice as much as California, which ranked fi rst in agricultural production. 7 If gross farm sales were used to measure farm size, then small commercial farms' share of production falls to 16 percent due largely to reclassifi cation of poultry production. Small commercial farms account for 3 percent of poultry production if gross farm sales is used to measure size, compared with 55 percent if GCFI is used.

Multiple-generation farms are more common among larger farms, and their share peaks at 23 percent of very large farms.

On average, operators of small commercial farms report providing 2,000-3,000 hours of annual unpaid labor to the farm. 10 Farms that combine small-farm revenues with 2,000-3,000 hours of annual labor are unlikely to generate operating profi ts. Hours of labor increase with farm size, but GFI increases even more, reducing the charge for unpaid labor as a percentage of GFI. Figure 7 includes all unpaid hours, whether provided by operators, spouses, children, or others, but most of the hours are provided by principal operators.\nGCFI=Gross cash farm income. Note: This figure includes only unincorporated farms, since the adjustments for operator and unpaid labor apply only to those farms. 1 Charge for operator and unpaid labor = (hours worked by the principal operator + unpaid hours worked by others) x the wage rate for farm labor. Unprofi table small farms do not necessarily go out of business. Small-farm households may accept losses-or place a low value on their labor-to meet goals that go beyond operating a profi table farm. Some of these goals may include receiving long-term capital gains, sheltering off-farm income from taxation, living a rural lifestyle, and having the opportunity to pass the farm on to heirs. These unprofi table farms are likely to continue, as long as the operator's household has enough off-farm income to meet living expenses and farm losses are not unduly large.\nNevertheless, the disparity in average fi nancial performance across farms in different size classes has important implications for farm structure. The number of small commercial farms is shrinking, as is their share of agricultural production, while the number of larger farms is growing. Given that the average fi nancial performance of larger farms continues to exceed that of small operations, production should continue to shift to larger farms. Because some small farms remain profi table or are willing to accept losses, the shift of production to larger farms will continue to be gradual, and substantial numbers of small commercial farms will remain in business. "}, {"section_title": "Off-Farm Income Supports Small-Farm Households", "text": "While operators of larger farms tend to earn higher household incomes, operators of small farms do not, in general, earn low incomes. On average, small-farm household income corresponds closely to income for other U.S. households. Small-farm operators rely heavily on income from off-farm sources. In calculating household income, we combine income from offfarm sources, such as wages and salaries, earnings from operating another business, or pension payments, with the net income accruing to the household from the farm business (i.e., net of expenses and farm business income fl owing to partners and other stakeholders). ARMS collects these data for principal operator households on family farms.\nOn farms with GCFI of less than $100,000, operator households have a median income near the $47,300 median for all U.S. households (fi g. 9). Overall, about 56 percent of farm households earn at least the median income for all U.S. households. Households operating farms at the upper end of the small commercial scale (GCFI of $100,000-$250,000) had a higher median income in 2007 ($68,600), which is closer to the median for U.S. households with a self-employed head ($75,700) than to that for all U.S. households. 12\n12 Farm household income estimates from ARMS are generally compared with the income of all U.S. households from the Current Population Survey (CPS). This report, however, uses the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) to make comparisons because the SCF oversamples wealthy households that hold a large share of unincorporated businesses (Bucks et al., 2009, p. A54) . This allows more meaningful comparisons between farm households from ARMS with all U.S. households with a self-employed head. In addition, the SCF collects data on wealth, unlike the CPS. Farm household wealth will be compared with the wealth of all U.S. households in another section."}, {"section_title": "Farm and Off-Farm Sources of Income", "text": "Farming, on average, does not make a positive contribution to household income until GCFI reaches $50,000. Even for small commercial farms in the $100,000-$249,999 class, off-farm income contributes about as much to total household income as farm earnings. On most noncommercial and small commercial farms (74 percent and 59 percent, respectively), the operator and/or spouse work off the farm. For older operators, income from Social Security, pensions, and investments may also be an important source of income.\nThe more small-farm households rely on off-farm income, the more they are affected by the nonfarm economy. As a result, macroeconomic and monetary policies affecting the nonfarm economy are important to small-farm households. The U.S. tax code provision that allows farmers to write off farm losses against other income is important to farmers with off-farm income (Durst, 2009, pp. 4-6) . In addition, the status of retirement programs is important to retired operators and to older operators approaching retirement."}, {"section_title": "Wealth of Farm Households", "text": "Wealth-or net worth-also contributes to farm households' well-being. Compared with all U.S. households, farm households have a high net worth, regardless of farm size. Much of their wealth comes from the ownership of land, and even a small farm operator can own land worth several hundred thousand dollars. ARMS calculates net worth as the difference between the value of the assets owned by the principal operator's household and the liabilities that it owes.\nHousehold wealth is also strongly associated with farm size (fi g. 10). Median net worth for households owning very large farms ($2.5 million) is six or seven times larger than that for operators of noncommercial farms. Nevertheless, median household net worth in every farm income class is higher than that for U.S. households in general. In fact, 94 percent of farm households' net worth is equal to or greater than that for all U.S. households.\nFarm households also have a high net worth compared with U.S. households with a self-employed head (median net worth of $388,700 in 2007). Median net worth among farm households with GCFI less than $1,000 was about 11 percent lower, but net worth in all other farm size classes exceeded it. Overall, 64 percent of farm households' net worth was at least equal to the median for self-employed households.\nThe farm accounts for most of the wealth of farm households, regardless of farm size. Overall, about three quarters of operator household net worth is based on the farm. Most of this net worth is illiquid and not available for household spending, since it is largely based on assets necessary for farming. Real estate, including the operator's dwelling, accounts for 79 percent of family farms' assets. 3,000 Median net worth for: All U.S. households = $120,300 U.S. households with a self-employed head = $388,700"}, {"section_title": "Small Farms and Farm Policy", "text": "The Federal Government provides support to farmers in many ways, typically through programs administered by the USDA. USDA agencies perform and support research and extension efforts, develop new products, purchase commodities, and provide services to farmers. For example:\nThe Agricultural Marketing Service operates information programs \u2022 designed to make commodity markets operate more effectively.\nThe Farm Service Agency provides farm real estate and operating \u2022 loans through certain designated programs.\nThe Risk Management Agency provides support for premiums in crop \u2022 insurance programs.\nSeveral USDA agencies combine to purchase some agricultural \u2022 commodities for food distribution programs or may increase purchases of surplus commodities.\nThese programs affect farm income indirectly by providing services to farmers or by affecting the prices at which they sell products. The USDA also provides direct fi nancial support payments to farmers through two broad groups of \"farm programs:\" commodity-related programs and conservation programs (see box, \"Farm Program Payments\"). In general, support from commodity-related programs follows the production of certain commodities. While small farms receive such payments, most go to large farms because they generate more production of the relevant commodities. Small farms receive a larger share of conservation program payments.\nCommodity-related payments depend on past or present production of specifi c commodities. Most such payments relate to fi eld crops-largely feed and food grains, cotton, and oilseeds-and are tied to yield histories and the amount of cropland enrolled in programs. Fruit and vegetable commodities and most livestock commodities have generally not provided a basis for payments under commodity programs. 13 Conservation payments are made through two types of programs: landretirement and working-land programs. Land-retirement programs take environmentally sensitive farmland out of production for long periods-at least 10 years-while working-land programs provide fi nancial and technical aid to farmers who use conservation practices on land still in production.\nAlmost 40 percent of U.S. farms received some type of farm program payment in 2007 (table 4) .

The same pattern holds for small commercial farms with GCFI of less than $50,000. They produce some grain/soybeans, but beef, hay, and high-value crops account for most production in that class (see table 1 ). As a result, only a third of farms in that class receive commodity-related payments, and most payments received by those farms are conservation payments (table 4) .\nGrain/soybeans are more important products for small commercial farms with GCFI between $50,000 and $249,999 (see table 1 ). Most receive commodity-related payments, and the total payments received exceed conservation payments for those farms (table 4) . ARMS allows us to estimate the value of production for commodities covered by these programs and to estimate the share of such production held by farms in each size class. Small commercial farms accounted for 23 percent of program commodity production in 2007, and they received 29 percent of all commodity payments. 14 The share participating in commodity-related programs is even higher, however, for farms with GCFI of at least $250,000.

Small commercial farms used to account for a much larger share of farm production, but U.S. farm structure has changed over the last 25 years in response to fi nancial returns that favor large operations. We used census data to evaluate longrun trends in farm structure and compare changes in the size distribution of farms between 1982 and 2007 (table 5) .\nTo measure farm size in the census data, we must use size classes based on the market value of agricultural products sold or total sales made by the operation, plus the value of production received by landlords and production contractors. 15 These size classes were used earlier in the report, but they are defi ned here in terms of the market values of agricultural products sold, rather than GCFI.\nAgricultural prices were 43 percent higher, on average, in 2007 than they were in 1982, according to the Producer Price Index for Farm Products (PPIFP). We want to compare farm size distribution on a consistent basis, exclusive of the effects of price changes on sales. To make that comparison, we adjust the 1982 market value of agricultural products sold-denoted simply as sales in this section-to 2007 prices using the PPIFP. 15 GCFI cannot be constructed from census data, because the census does not separate the landlord's share of sales from the sales of the farm. In addition, the census did not collect information about receipts of Government payments or reasonably complete information about receipts of farm-related income until 1987. Thus, we could not construct an approximation of GCFI for 1982, even if we ignored the issue regarding the landlord share of sales. Notes: Sales classes are defi ned in 2007 dollars, using the Producer Price Index for Farm Products (PPIFP) to adjust for price changes. Point farms are identifi ed using current dollars-with no adjustment for price changes-because the minimal level of sales in the farm defi nition is not adjusted for price changes.\n1 Sales class is based on the market value of agricultural products sold.\n2 Point farms have sales of less than $1,000 (current dollars) but are still considered farms because they would be expected to normally sell at least $1,000 of agricultural products. The shift in sales and production to very large farms refl ects, in part, technological advancements in the production of fed cattle, hogs, poultry, and milk. Livestock production moved from the outside to climate-controlled buildings, making production less dependent on the weather. Other advances in disease control, handling, transport, and nutrition increased the number of production cycles per year. These technological advancements helped standardize production, making it easier for farms to operate on a large scale (Allen and Lueck, 1998, p. 370) .\nSubstantial shifts to larger farms also occurred in crops (Hoppe et al., 2007, table 11, p. 33) . Technological factors-including larger and faster equipment, information technologies, and more routinized pest control through genetically modifi ed seeds-expanded the acreage that farm operators could control.\nIn fi eld crops, however, farm size increased most in areas where commodity payments per acre were highest, with payments per acre varying across local areas in accordance with the mix of commodities grown, with historic yields, and with soil quality. While this growth in farm size could refl ect technological changes that differentially affected areas with high yields and higher payments, it also suggests that the pattern of payments could accelerate changes in farm size (Key and Roberts, 2007) .\nThe share of production held by small commercial farms fell by 3 percentage points between 2002 and 2007, after falling by 5-6 percentage points in each 16 Another factor that increased the count of point farms was an adjustment for undercoverage instituted in the census of agriculture, beginning with the 2002 census. This adjustment has the largest impact on farms near the $1,000 cutoff in the farm defi nition (Allen, 2004; USDA, NASS, 2004 17 Note that the 2007 estimates differ from those reported in fi gure 2, where small commercial farms accounted for 22 percent of production and very large farms accounted for 47 percent. The difference refl ects our reliance on GCFI as a sales measure in fi gure 2, whereas we are forced to use the market value of agricultural products sold as the sales measure in the long-term analysis found in fi gure 11. The market value includes the value of production accruing to contractors, which can be substantial in poultry and hog production. Several thousand poultry and hog farms, and their production, would be assigned to the very large class using market value and to smaller sales classes using GCFI.\nof the 4 previous intercensal periods. Those small farms now focus on beef production in cow-calf operations, poultry production in contract growing operations, and small-scale production of hay and grain/soybeans (see table  1 ). Each of these production operations can be carried out without a full-time commitment of farm labor. Absent technological changes that alter how production can be carried out, small commercial farms will likely maintain a signifi cant presence in these areas.

Although small commercial farms make substantial contributions to the production of some commodities, noncommercial farms produce very little in the aggregate, while large and very large farms account for most production.\nSmall farms account for half of all farmland. Due to the large amount \u2022 of land they control, small farms are important to conservation efforts. Small farms account for 82 percent of the land enrolled in land-retirement programs and receive 83 percent of land-retirement payments.\nSmall commercial farms have a distinct product mix, focusing on \u2022 commodities that do not require a full-time commitment of labor: poultry, beef (cow/calf or stocker enterprises), hay, and grain/ soybeans. High-value crops and dairy require substantial commitments of labor. Small commercial farms produce few of these commodities, while high-value crops and dairy production account for 44 percent of production on very large farms.\nSmall-farm households depend heavily on off-farm income. Because \u2022 of their off-farm income, median household income for each smallfarm sales class is comparable with the median for all U.S. households.\nLarge and very large farms tend to be more profi table than small farms, \u2022 and the difference in average returns is an important factor behind structural changes in agriculture. Financial performance varies among small farms, however, and many small farms are profi table and will remain viable economic entities. Other farm households-especially those operating noncommercial farms-farm for reasons other than profi t and will remain in business as long as their farm losses are not unduly large.\nSmall commercial farms have faced declining shares of farm numbers \u2022 and production for decades and those trends will likely continue. Larger farms have competitive advantages over smaller farms in most commodities, refl ecting economies of size in farming (Hoppe et al., 2008; MacDonald et al., 2007; Key and McBride, 2007) . The advanced age of farm operators with sales of $10,000-$99,999 suggests more small commercial farms will exit the industry.\nThe number of noncommercial farms is less likely to decrease. These \u2022 farms have consistently produced a very small share of farm output (1 or 2 percent) since 1982, and households operating them depend heavily on off-farm income. In some respects, these noncommercial farms and their households exist independently of the farm economy, so a decline in their numbers due to competition with larger farms is not as likely. The number of point farms increased substantially between the 2002 and 2007 Censuses of Agriculture, refl ecting much greater efforts by NASS to count all small farms in the census. Another increase of this magnitude in the future is unlikely."}]
