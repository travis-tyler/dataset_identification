Of the total 90,600 humanities doctorates, approximately 18,300 were employed in nonhumanities fields (4,400 in education7), and another 8,7008 were not employed. These two groups represent approximately 30 percent of all humanities doctorates. Table 1 gives the distribution of 1944.-1984 humanities doctorates in the United States by field of doctorate and field of employment as of February 1985. For all fields except the general category of \"unspecified other humanities,\" the number of Ph.D.s with degrees in specific fields equals or exceeds the number employed in those fields. The greatest disparities were noted for the fields of English/American languages and literature (23,700 degree:, earned compared to 15,800 individuals employed, a difference of 7,900), \"other history\" (12,500 degrees earned compared to 7,500 individuals working in the field, a difference of 5,000), and modern languages and literature (16,000 degrees earned and 11,000 individuals employed, again a difference of 5,000). As noted earlier, these three fields were also the largest humanities fields in terms of Ph.D. production. The reader is cautioned in the interpretation of these figures, however, because the field of employment numbers include Ph.D.s from a variety of humanities fields, not just those who remain in the same field (i.e., not all of the 15,800 Ph.D.s employed in English and American 5The categories for the humanities include American history; \"other history\" (history and philosophy of science and all history except American history); art history; music; spec!' /theater; philosophy; English/American languages and literature; classical languages and literature; modem languages and literature; and \"other humanities\" (linguistics, archeology, American studies, religious studies, and unspecified other humanities). 6See Science, Engineering, and Humanities Doctorates: 1983Profile, Wash agton, D.C.: National Academy Press, 1985, and Science, Engineering, and Humanities Doctorates: 1981:z, 1982. 7For additional information on the estimated number of humanities Ph.D.s who were employed in each field category and on the 20.3 percent employed in the nonhumanities categories, see Appendix F. 8The reader should not use this figure to calculate an unemployment rate because it includes those individuals wk, were retired or unemployed but not seeking employment.

The Middle Atlantic and South Atlantic regions had the most humanities doctorates-16,300 (18.5 percent) and 15,500 (17.1 percent), respectively. The regions with the fewest humanities Ph.D.s were the East South Central region (4,000, or 4.4 percent) and the Mountain region (4,300, or 4.8 percent).   percentage has remained relatively constant over the past several years (90.3 percent in 1981 and 89.9 percent in 1983). As shown in Table 2, these humanities Ph.D.s are distributed acrcf:c a variety of employment fields. The percentage of Ph.D.s from a given field who remain in the smile field when employed is defined as the retention rate of the field. On the other hand, a humanilies Ph.D. who is employed either in a nonhumanities field or in a broadly defined humanities field'\u00b0 that is different from his/her degree field is defined as \"field mobile.\" The largest percentage of fielc-mobile Ph.D.s tended to secure employment in nonhumanities fields (primarily in education). Figure 2 shows the distribution of the Ph.D.s who were employed in nonhumanities fields. The disciplines with the highest retention rates were music (86.1 nercent of the 6,100 employed music Ph.D.$) and art history (84.8 percent of the 2,4C., employed art history Ph.D.$). The lowest retention rate occurred for those Ph.D.s categorized in ' other humanities\" (which includes linguistics, archeology, American studies, religious studies, and unspecified other humanities). This tendency for high mobility may, however, be related to the fact that this is such a diversified group that the individuals therein do not behave like a group in which the individuals had similar training and Ph.D. experiences. Of the 6,800 Ph.D.s in the \"other humanities\" group, 30.5 percent were employed in nonhumanities fields such as education or social sciences. About the same amount of outflow to nonhumanities occurred for those Ph.D.s with degrees in \"other history,\" where ahlost one-third of the 11,400 Ph.D.s indicated that they were employed in nonhumanities areas in 1985. 1013roadly defined humanities fields are those listed in Table 2 under \"field of doctorate.\" 7 2 c)  1942-1949 1950-1959 1900-1969 1970-1979 1980-1982 1983-1984  With the exception of \"other history\" and \"other humanities,\" the retention rates for humanities fields were 60 percent or higher. There was relatively greater field mobility between history fields: American history and \"other history\" (9.1 percent and 8.7 percent, respectively); between languages and literature: classical to modem (4.6 percent) and modern to English/American (3.8 percent); and from speech/theater to English/American languages and 1*.terature (5.2 percent).

Findings from previous SDR surveys showed that men consistently outnumbered women in all humanities fields. This was not true in 1985, where analyses show that women, outnumbered men in the field of art history (50.8 percent of the 1942-1984 Ph.D.s were women). The reader should keep in mind, however, that art history is one of the smallest fields in the humanities, having 2,700 Ph.D.s. Therefore, an increase in the percentage of women in this field does not constitute a significant increase for women in humanities overall."}, {"section_title": "9", "text": "As was true in 1983, the representation of women it most fields increased by 1-2 percent, except in classical languages and literature, where women have shown a steady decline of about 1 percent since the 1981 survey. Other fields where relatively high percentages of women were represented were modern languages and literature (43.6 percent of the 16,000 Ph.D.$), English/American languages and literature (35.1 percent of the 23,700 Ph.D.$), and \"other humanities\" (32.5 percent of the 7,500 doctorates). While the percentages of women in history and philosophy are increasing (from 14.3 percent in 1977 to 17.4 percent in 1985 in history and from 13.5 percent in 1977 to 15.4 percent in 1985 in philosophy), these fields continue to have the lowest percentages of women. Members of racial/ethnic minority groups (i.e., Blacks, American Indians, Asians, and Hispanics) constituted 6.6 percent of the humanities Ph.D. population in 1985, increasing from 6.2 percent in 1983. As seen in Figure 4, this small increase in the percentage of minorities has been consistently observed since 1977, when minorities 1985 was 47 years. This age increase is related to the fact that Ph.D. production has 10 decreased slightly and graduates are slightly older when .eceiving their doctorates.11 Overall, only one-fifth of the Ph.D. humanists were younger than 40 years of age. The fields of \"other humanities,\" music, and art history had the highest percentage of Ph.D.s under 40 years of age: 30.9 percent, 30.3 percent, and 28.3 percent, respectively. As was true in past surveys, Ph.D.s in speech/theater were oldest, with almost 50 percent falling into the \"50 years and older\" category. A review by field of the calendar year in which Ph.D.s were awarded provides an indication of the relative growth and the attractiveness of the fields over time. For example, the fields of art history, music, and \"other humanities\" have produced aprroximately twothirds of their doctorates since 1970. Fields such as classical languages and literature, speech/theater, and \"other history\" have produced only 53.4 percent, 55.5 percent, and 57.1 percent, respectively, during, the 1970-1984 period. In 1985, 3.2 percent of the humanities Ph.D.s in the United States were foreign citizens, a slight increase from 1983 and 1981 figures (3.0 and 2.7 percent, respectively). The degree fields with the highest percentage of foreign citizens have remained the same over the years: modern languages and literature (7.9 percent), art history (5.6 percent), and \"other humanities\" (5.4 percent). The field of American history had the lowest percentage of foreign citizens, 0.5 percent. However, as the SDR does not have a comprehensive sampling frame for foreign-earned Ph.D.s, these percentages are most likely an underestimation of the representation of foreign citizens in the Ph.D. population in the United States. 11The median age of the 3,745 humanities doctorates who graduated in FY1981 was 33.5 years. In FY1984, the number graduating dropped to 3,528 and their median age rose to 34.5 years. See Summary  (Table 4). As can be seen in Figure 5, this percentage has declined slightly sine' 1977, when Rpproximately 84 percent were employed full-time. The percentage holdnig parttime positions, on the other hand, has beer increasing over this time period--from 4.6 pc:cent in 1977 to 7.1 percent in 1985. ire small percentage who reported that they were on postdoctoral appointmentsa declined even further, from 1.0 percent in 1977 to 0.3 percent in 1985. The percentage of doctorates N. 10 were not employed has decreased slightly over the years: 9.6 percent in 1977, 9.2 percent in 1981, and 9.0 percent in 1985. The reader is cautioned, however, that the 9.6 percent classified as \"not employed\" is NOT an unemployme.t rate. This rate is calculated on the total population of 1942-1984 humanities doctorates and therefore includes those who were retired (6.2 percent), those who were not seeking employment (1.6 percent), and those not reporting employment status Philosophy continued to have the highest percentage of Ph.D.s in full-time employment, 88.1 percent. However. the only field with a notable increase since 1983 in the percentage employed full-time was modem languages and literature (81.7 percent in 1985 compared to 78.2 percent in 1983) In the other humanities fields, the percentage employed full-time was stable or increased only slightly. Ph.D.s in art history were an exception, with 77.0 percent reporting full-time employment in 1985 compared to 78.4 percent in 1983. Along with having thc lowest percentage of those employed fulltime, art history continued to show the highest percentage employed in part-time jobs (10.5 percent) and on postdoctoral appointments (1.6 percent). In fact, this was the only field with greater than 1.0 percent on postdoctoral appointments; all other humanities fields had 0.5 percent or less. The fields of classical languages and literature and modem languages and literature had the highest percentages of Ph.D.s who were not employed in February 1985 (11.2 percent and 11.1 percent, respectively). However, over half of these Ph.D.s were retired (6.0 percent and 6.3 percent, respectively), and an additional 2 percent in each 12This category includes postdoctoral fellowships, traineeships, research associateships, and internships.  As shown in Table 5, the percentages of 1979-1984 Ph.D.s in full-time jobs was similar to percentages for the total cohort across fields, except in modern languages and literature, where only 76.7 percent of the recent graduates reported being in full-time jobs, compared to 81.7 percent of the total Ph.D.s in the field. For all humanities Ph.D.s, the most notable difference between the recent Ph.D. graduates and the total cohort was the higher percentage of recent Ph.D.s who were in part-time jobs--11.3 percent, compared to 7.1 percent of the total cohort.

A further breakdown of this group shows that 5.2 percent were seeking employment, but another 4.1 percent were either retired or unemployed and not seeking employment. The latter statistic is surprising in view of the fact that it applies to recent graduates. The same kind of finding is noted in the field of English/American languages and literature, where 4.9 percent of the 4,200 Ph.D.s in the recent cohort indicated that they were either retired or not employed and not seeking employment.

Of the 7.7 percent who were employed in part-time jobs, less than one-third (2.5 percent) were seeking full-time employment. The unemployment rate (1.7 percent) has remained unchanged since 1983. By field, the unemployment rates varied slightly, with modern languages and literature and classical languages and literature having the highest rates (2.7 percent and 2.6 percent, respectively) and American history and philosophy the lowest (1.1 and 1.0 percent, respectively). More than half of the Ph.D.s in \"other humanities\" who were employed part-time were seeking full-time employment.

This percentage has been declining steadily since 1979, when 86.6 percent of the humanities Ph.Ds indicated that they were employed by educational institutions. This decline is evident not only for the total group, but also within the various humanities fields. Conversely While only 2.4 percent of all humanities doctorates reported that they were employed by the federal government in 1985, the percentage is more than twice as high for history Ph.D.s (5.9 percent for \"other history\" and 5.5 percent for American history). In fact, government employment on all levels (federal, state, and local) attracted 8.7 percent of the American history Ph.D.s and 8.3 percent of the \"other history\" Ph.D.s, thus making \"government\" the second most frequent employer for historians. Art history Ph.D.s and humanists in the \"other humanities\" category frequently accepted employment with nonprofit organizations other than educational institutions (9.9 percent and 8.8 percent, respectively). In fact, nonprofit organizations were the second most frequently reported employer for art historians.  (Table 10). In comparison with all humanities Ph.D.s, the recent doctorates were far less likely to be working in 4-year colleges /universities /medical schools (65.7 percent versus 74.3 percent for the total group) and more likely to be employed either by ?.-year colleges and elementary and secondary schools (10.5 percent compared to 8.0 percent for the total group) or by business/industry (11.6 percent compared to 8.7 percent for the total group). As was true for the 1942-1984 Ph.D. cohorts, government (federal, state, and local) employed large percentages of recent Ph.D. historians (16.0 percent of American history Ph.D.s and 14.5 percent of \"other history\" Ph.D.$), and other nonprofit organizations were agrin the second most frequent employer of recent graduates with art history degrees (14.1 percent).

It is also worth noting the trend, for the past several surveys, for history Ph.D.s to have teaching as their primary activity less frequently. Whether this is the result of fewer hist Ay teaching jobs or of an ever-increasing demand for history Ph.D.s in managerial jobs is difficult to say.

This latest percentage represents a downturn in the growth rate of humanities salaries: prior to 1985, the percentage increase had been getting larger every two years (8.5 percent from 1977 to 1979, 14.8 percent from 1979 to 1981, and 16.3 percent from 1981 to 1983). By field, Ph.D.s with degrees in American history had the highest median salary, $37,300. On the other hand, Ph.D.s in the \"other humanities\" field had the lowest median salary, $31,500, followed closely by Ph.D.s in mu.iic ($32,400) and Ph.D.s in classical languages and literature ($32,600). Ph.D.s in speech/theater, who had been holding the highest median salaries for the previous four survey years, dropped behind Ph.D.s both in American history and \"other history\" and in philosophy. For all fields combined, men had a median salary of $35,800 compared to $30,700 for women, a differential of over $5,000. Across all humanities fields, the median salaries of the men were consistently higher than those of the women in the same fields ( Figure 6). Although both women and men in the field of American history earned the highest median salaries, the salaries of female Ph.D.s were substantially lower than those of the male Ph.D.s ($32,900 for females compared to $38,100 for males, a $5,200 difference). The largest difference across the humanities fields by sex occurred in philosophy, in which male Ph.D.s earned a median salary of $36,500 compared to $30,800 for women, a $5,700 gap. The smallest salary differences occurred in the fields of \"other humanities\" ($2,700 difference) and classical languages and literature ($2,900 difference). In general, the median annual salaries of men and women became more disparate with the increase in the number of years since the Ph.D. was awarded. For all fields combined, the salary differential between men and women within five years of receipt of Ph.D. was only $700, and in two fields the median salary for women was higher than that for men (\"other history\": $26,500 for women and $25,700 for men; and English and American languages and literature: $25,800 for women and $25,300 for men). In art history and speech/theater, on the other hand, men within five years of receipt of Ph.D. made considerably more than their female counterparts (approximately $28,000 for men and approximately $24,000 for women). As the number of years since receipt of the doctorate increases, so does the gap between salaries of men and women: a differential of $1,300 for Ph.D.s receiving their doctorates 11-15 years earlier and $4,600 for those having their degrees for 21-30 years. The greatest difference in median salaries was for those Ph.D.s whose degrees were earned over 30 years ago. However, because of the relatively small number in this cohort, mer4;an salaries could be reported by field and sex only for modern languages and literature, where men received the highest median salaries of all humanities fields, $52,500. NOTE: Median salaries were computed only for Ph.D.s employed full-time, excluding those in the U.S. military. Academic salaries were multiplied by 11/9 to adjust for a full-time scale. Medians were not provided for cells with less than 20 cases reporting salary. By Field of Doctorate, Gender, and Type of Employer The median annual salaries of humanities Ph.D.s by type of employer varied considerably. Overall, 4-year colleges/universities/medical schools and 2-year colleges provided the highest salaries for humanities doctorates, $35,100 and $35,000, respectively (Table 14). The lowest median salaries were earned by humanities Ph.D.s employed by elementary/secondary schools ($30,000) and business/industry, including self-employed individuals ($30,800). A comparison of salaries reported in 1983 and in 1985 shows that government-employed humanists experienced the greatest increase (from $28,600 to $33,500, a $4,900 increase). Inoreases since 1983 for those employed by educational institutions and by business/industry were $3,900 and $3,000, respectively. By field, music and American history Ph.D.s working at 2-year colleges had the highest median salaries ($40,300 and $39,500, respectively). Music Ph.D.s working in business/industry reported the lowest median salary ($25,500). As reported earlier, men consistently earned higher median salaries than women across all the humanities fields. Analysis of the salary data by type of employer shows some even greater disparities between the salaries for men and women in certain fields. For example. men with degrees in modern languages and literature and employed in government earned $9,300 more than their female counterparts, and men with degrees in music and employed by educational institutions earned $6,100 more than the women. On the other 112.;.(.1., females with degrees in \"other humanities\" and employed in business/ industry earned $9,600 mere than their male counterparts. The lowest median salaries for both women and men were for music Ph.D.s employed by business/industry ($19,600 for women and $25,700 for men).

For all fields combined, an estimated 12.9 percent of the men held the rank of assistant professor compared to 25.1 percent of the women, and 2.8 percent of the men were instructors compared to 6.3 percent of the women. Similarly, for all field groupings except English/American languages and literature, higher percentages of 1979-1984 female Ph.D.s held assistant professor positions than did their male counterparts. Within the ranks of associate and full professor, however, the female share was consistently lov er than the male share, both for the more recent Ph.D.s (again, except for those in English/American languages and literature) and for the total group. Over half (52.5 percent) of the 12,600 male history Ph.D.s employed in academe held the rank of full professor; only 29.5 percent of the 2,200 females in the field held a similar rank. In pite of this large gender gap, it should also be noted that no other field had such a high representation of women in the full professor rank. While for the total group women were more likely than mtn to hold nonfaculty positions and postdoctoral appointments, this did not hold true for the more recent graduates, of whom 6.5 percent of the men and 5.7 percent of the women were in nonfaculty jobs.

In the previous example, if the initial sample size equalled 1600: k = (100/1600) =1/16. The sampling error increased from 0.01 to 0.04, a factor of 4.

The expected effect of the sample size reduction on the sampling errors surrounding the estimates of the total population can be approximated by computing k = (15, 504/19, 157) = .809 and 11(k)1/2 = 1.11. Thin, for a fixed standard deviation, the sampling error should be approximately 11 percent greater under the 1985 sampling scheme. In these computations, the effects of the finite population correction factor (fpc) have been ignored. The fpc has little effect on sampling error estimates for large populations and low sampling rates. However, although the overall sampling rate for the 1985 SDR sample is 16.2 percent, sampling rates for the strata range from roughly 2 percent to 100 percent. Thus, computation of sampling errors that takes into account sample stratification will result m lower sampling error estimates than computations that disregard the sample design. Finally, this discussion applies only to the total sample n and does not address the issue of less than complete survey rzlionse, which will of course effectively reduce the sample and thus increase the sampling error. The estimates of sampling error for most statistics in this report are computed based on a stratified random sampling scheme (whereby the responses obtained for each stratum are a random sample from that stratum).
