[{"section_title": "", "text": "substantial, so do concerns about whether these students actually transfer to four-year institutions.\nAn extensive review of related research literature spanning over 30 years suggests that baccalaureate aspiring students who begin at community colleges suffer a disadvantage in realizing their degree goals in comparison to similar students who start at four-year institutions as freshmen (Pascarella & Terenzini, 2005) . Research based on more recent student populations has also indicated that this disadvantage is still being experienced by today's baccalaureate-aspiring students who attend community colleges (Long & Kurlaender, 2009 ). Pascarella and Terenzini further argued that part of the disadvantage appears to be associated with whether students in fact transfer to a four-year institution. Unfortunately, a considerable number of students who expect to earn a bachelor's degree but begin at a community college never transfer (Berkner, He, & Cataldi, 2002) . Therefore, the question of what contributes to the successful transfer to four-year institutions becomes a pressing issue facing community colleges.\nThe purpose of this study is to identify factors that explain the transfer to four-year institutions among baccalaureate aspirants beginning at community colleges. This research examines how these students' precollege characteristics, motivational beliefs, academic behaviors while matriculating at community colleges, and external demands affect the probability of their transferring to baccalaureate-granting institutions. While taking into consideration the effects of a number of variables, such as social background and race/ethnicity, that were extensively studied in the literature from earlier decades, this study incorporates the psychological perspective and seeks to explore the influence of less researched, but theoretically sound motivational factors on community college transfer. The results from this study will inform community colleges in formulating policies to positively impact student transfer and progress towards degree goals."}, {"section_title": "Review of the Literature Community College Transfer", "text": "For the past few decades, quite a number of studies have explored factors related to student transfer from two-year to four-year institutions (e.g., Anderson, 1981; Bailey, Jenkins, & Leinbach, 2005; Breneman & Nelson, 1981; Brint & karabel, 1989; Cohen & Brawer, 1996; Deng, 2006; Dougherty, 1987 Dougherty, , 1994 Lee & frank, 1990; Lee, Mackie-Lewis, & Marks, 1993; Meznek, 1987; Roksa, 2006; velez, 1985; velez & Javalgi, 1987) . Similar to most of the literature addressing college student departure (e.g., Bean, 1986; Cabrera, Nora, & Castaneda, 1993; Tinto, 1987 Tinto, , 1993 , many of these studies explored the effects of various student background characteristics and their results confirmed the pronounced impact of entry characteristics on educational outcomes (Pascarella & Terenzini, 1991 , 2005 . Significant background predictors of community college transfer include gender, socioeconomic status (SES), and race/ethnicity (e.g., velez & Javalgi, 1987) , first-generation status and family income (e.g., , as well as high school academic preparation (e.g., Cohen & Brawer, 1996) and the academic resources students bring to college (Adelman, 1999; Hoachlander et al., 2003) .\nA considerable number of studies on community college transfer have focused on the effect of remediation. Findings from this line of research, however, are often equivocal (Adelman, 1999; Bailey & Alfonso, 2005; Pascarella & Terenzini, 2005) . This lack of consistent results on the effectiveness of remediation might stem from reliance on single institution data, small sample sizes, and analytical methods that involve minimal statistical controls (Bahr, 2008) . In recent years, utilizing large-scale multi-institutional data and sophisticated research designs, a small but growing number of studies have produced more solid evidence on the efficacy of remediation (Attewell, Lavin, Domina, & Levey, 2006; Bahr, 2008; Bettinger & Long, 2005) . Specific to transfer as an outcome, Bahr (2008) found that students who are successful in math remediation have a transfer rate comparable to students who have college-level math skill without the need for remediation.\nStudies dealing with the effects of institutional factors on transfer have addressed the vocational versus liberal arts orientation of community colleges (e.g., Brint & karabel, 1989; Deng, 2006; Dougherty, 1987 Dougherty, , 1994 Roksa, 2006) . Results from the research in this vein have also been mixed. Brint & karabel (1989) and Dougherty (1987 Dougherty ( , 1994 found that the vocational focus of community colleges decreases transfer rates and therefore hinders bachelor's degree attainment. This criticism, however, was challenged by recent research showing that controlling for individual and state characteristics, attending vocationally focused community colleges does not inevitably affect transfer negatively (Roksa, 2006) . Although these and many other studies have generated fairly important knowledge regarding various characteristics associated with the upward transfer of community college students, there are two weaknesses with the current state of research in this stream. Most notably, when considering the effects of student precollege characteristics, these stud-ies seldom accounted for factors beyond demographic variables, often introduced as statistical controls. Very few studies have explored the potentially powerful influence of pertinent psychological attributes. This is an important limitation: Given the strong correlation between students' attitudes, intentions, and behaviors (Bean, 1986; Bean & Eaton, 2000; Eaton & Bean, 1995) , baccalaureate aspirants' motivational characteristics may well influence their intent to persist to their ultimate degree goals by virtue of transferring to four-year institutions. However, existing literature on community college transfer offers little knowledge on the connection between transfer and student motivational beliefs which may exert important influence on student behavior (Wang, 2009 ). Another compelling reason for including pertinent motivational attributes in studying upward transfer is that motivational beliefs may be overcome by training (Graham & Weiner, 1996) . Empirical studies have suggested that college students' motivational beliefs such as self-concept can be enhanced by environmental support (Loeb & Magee, 1992) and in particular by interaction with faculty (Gerdes & Mallinckrodt, 1994; Woodside, Wong, & Wiest, 1999) . As such, a better understanding of the effects of relevant motivational attributes on transfer will inform community colleges' decisions regarding programs and interventions to transform these beliefs in a positive sense.\nIn addition, most studies on community college transfer did not distinguish between students whose initial goal is baccalaureate or higher and those who do not have such a degree goal. Since educational aspirations are closely tied to educational attainment (e.g., Camburn, 1990; Carter, 2002; Pascarella & Terenzini, 1991 , 2005 , analyzing in aggregate baccalaureate aspirants and students who aim at less than a baccalaureate degree may produce results that lead to unjustified criticism of community colleges for hindering students' educational attainment."}, {"section_title": "Psychological Perspectives", "text": "Informed by prior literature on community college transfer, this study also draws upon theories in psychology. When accounting for student entry characteristics, research based on existing models of college departure tends to limit its choices of variables to family background, race/ethnicity, gender, and prior academic achievement only, thus often neglecting psychological attributes. However, as discussed previously, motivational beliefs that underlie individual behaviors may become especially relevant when studying baccalaureate aspirants beginning at community colleges. For this group of students, the road to a bachelor's degree is more complicated and entails more barriers as students negotiate a series of transitions in postsecondary education (Wang, 2009 ). The baccalaureate aspirants who successfully complete the complex process of transfer might be especially resilient and motivated (Lee et al., 1993) . Therefore, this study particularly focuses on three relevant psychological attributes, namely perceived locus of control, self-concept, and aspirations for a graduate degree.\nA motivational variable often linked to academic achievement, locus of control is defined as \"a generalized belief about the extent to which behaviors influence outcomes (successes, failures)\" (Pintrich & Schunk, 2002, p. 253) . Individuals with an external locus of control believe that their own actions exert minimal impact on outcomes and they can do very little to control the outcomes, whereas individuals with an internal locus of control are more inclined to think that their actions, which are largely under their control, shape outcomes (Pintrich & Schunk, 2002) . Perceived locus of control has been empirically proven to be positively associated with a broad array of advantageous educational outcomes in various educational contexts (e.g., findley & Cooper, 1983; Gifford, Mianzo, & Bricerio-Perriott, 2006; Pascarella, Edison, Hagedorn, Nora, & Terenzini, 1995; Perry, 1991) . Based on existing research, it is theoretically sound and empirically interesting to postulate that perceived locus of control is related to the upward transfer of baccalaureate aspirants beginning at community colleges. It is reasonable to expect that when facing external challenges, baccalaureate aspirants with stronger internal locus of control are more likely to persist in order to transfer to four-year institutions.\nAnother psychological construct of interest is self-concept, which represents the totality of a complex system of learned beliefs, attitudes, and opinions about the self (Purkey, 1988) . Previous research on selfconcept has confirmed that individuals' self-concept, by motivating and guiding behavior, influences their educational, social, and occupational performance (Markus & Kitayama, 1991) and has a profound impact on their future success (Goleman, 1995; McClelland, 1993) . Although still inconclusive and somewhat limited, results from a few studies have underscored the importance of this attribute in shaping college academic success (Boulter, 2002; House, 1995; Pascarella, Smart, Ethington, & Nettles, 1987; Smart & Pascarella, 1986) . Since self-concept is related to individuals' commitment, participation, and ability to cope with the environment, it stands to reason that baccalaureate aspirants who have more positive self-concept are more likely to transfer to a four-year institution than those with less positive self-concept.\nIn addition, educational aspirations are a vital part of educational attainment (Sewell, Haller, & Portes, 1969) . Although this study's sample was restricted to students who planned on a bachelor's degree or higher, there still might be substantive differences between those who want to complete a bachelor's degree only and those who plan on a graduate degree-students who aspire to attend graduate schools might exhibit a stronger momentum towards upward transfer. Therefore, this study also considers the effect of aspirations for a graduate degree.\nIncorporating the psychological perspective, this study aims to uncover a distinct set of characteristics that are uniquely associated with the upward transfer of baccalaureate-aspiring students who access postsecondary education through community colleges."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Databases", "text": "This study was based on data from the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS: 88/2000) and the Postsecondary Education Transcript Study (PETS). NELS: 88/2000 was initiated by National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) to follow a national sample of eighth graders for 12 years (1988) (1989) (1990) (1991) (1992) (1993) (1994) (1995) (1996) (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) . A supplementary study of NELS: 88/2000, PETS was completed in 2000 to gather official institutional records on student postsecondary enrollment. Transcript data were requested from 3,213 postsecondary institutions that NELS: 88/2000 students reported attending.\nTogether, NELS: 88/2000 and PETS offer rich information that provides researchers with a distinctive k-16 perspective to examine student access to postsecondary institutions and persistence towards degree completion. More importantly, NELS contains a unique set of student precollege psychological variables that are central to this research."}, {"section_title": "Sample", "text": "The defining variables for baccalaureate aspirants beginning at community colleges were the postsecondary school type for students' true first institution after high school graduation and students' educational expectations in 1992 when they were high school seniors. Students who expected to earn a bachelor's degree in 1992 and attended a community college as their first true postsecondary institution in 1992 and 1993 were selected. Approximately 2,300 students out of the 12,144 cases in the NELS: 88/2000 database enrolled in a community college during 1992 and 1993, soon after high school graduation. For the purpose of this study, I retained only the 1,421 community college entrants who expected to complete a bachelor's degree or higher. I merged the data from NELS and PETS, with the help of the accompanying Electronic Code Books (ECB) to create a new dataset for this study."}, {"section_title": "Measures", "text": "Given the study's primary focus on the upward transfer of bachelor's degree-seeking community college students, the dependent variable was a dichotomous variable measuring whether a student transferred to a four-year institution (a dummy variable that equals one if the student transferred to a baccalaureate-granting institution and zero otherwise). following Adelman (2005) , true community college to four-year transfer involved attending community colleges as first postsecondary education institutions, earning more than 10 credits from community colleges (with or without an associate degree), and subsequently earning more than 10 credits from baccalaureate-granting institutions, with or without earning a bachelor's degree.\nInformed by previously discussed literature on community college transfer and theories in psychology, the study examined the effects of a unique set of independent variables on the probability of upward transfer.\nDemographic characteristics. Demographic variables including gender, race/ethnicity, and SES were available in the PETS dataset. Gender was dummy coded (1 = female, 0 = male). Race/ethnicity was coded as a series of three dummy variables: Black, Hispanic, and Other, with non-Hispanic Whites as the reference category. Due to the small number of cases of Asians and American Indians in the sample, these two categories, together with Unknown, were collapsed into the \"Other\" race/ ethnicity category. SES was represented by socioeconomic status quintile in 1992, which was derived from a composite measure of parents' education, occupation, and income.\nAcademic preparation. Students' high school academic ability was measured by second follow-up (12th grade) standardized test composite scores in reading and math. Academic resources was characterized by the type of high school program the student was involved in at his or her last high school and was dummy coded (1 = academic, 0 = vocational and other).\nPsychological attributes. In the second follow-up study of NELS, 12th-grade students were asked to self-report on 13 survey items about their self-concept and perceived locus of control, using a 4-point Likert scale ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree. I performed a factor analysis on these items using a principal component extraction approach. As expected, two factors resulted from the analysis: self-concept and locus of control. I kept survey items with factor loadings of 0.50 or higher and dropped those with lower loadings. This resulted in retaining 10 individual items, with five items loaded on each of the two factors. I summed the items to create scales representing students' selfconcept and perceived locus of control respectively. Table 1 summarizes the results from this analysis. The study also included aspirations for a graduate degree as a dummy variable (1 = aspiring to earn a graduate degree, 0 = aspiring to earn a bachelor's degree only).\nPostsecondary experience. The information on student attendance patterns was available in the transcript study dataset. Student enrollment intensity was dummy coded (1 = enrolled at the institution full-time, 0 = enrolled at the institution less than full-time). Similarly, continuous enrollment was coded as one if student postsecondary enrollment was continuous without interruption and zero otherwise. Also included was the ratio of earned credits versus attempted credits during the first year, as previous research has indicated that this ratio is related to the persistence of recent high school students entering community colleges (Adelman, 2006) . In addition, external demands were measured by marital status, parental status, and work hours. Descriptive statistics and the definitions of the independent variables are presented in Table 2 . Missing Data All the selected cases were examined for missing data. Among variables with missing data, students' high school academic ability, represented by 12th-grade cognitive test scores collected during the second follow-up study, has a substantial amount of missing values. Approximately 24% of the cases did not have this information. To address this issue, I substituted the values of the same variable in the first follow-up study when students were tenth graders. Given the limitations of extant datasets, this is a feasible and logical way of data imputation for this variable. In fact, the test scores collected from the two waves were highly correlated (r = 0.903, p < 0.01). This imputation reduced the proportion of missing cases on test scores to approximately 4%. As a final step to address missing data, I used multiple imputation technique to substitute for missing values in the dataset. By replacing missing values with a set of plausible values instead of one single value, multiple imputation offers a helpful approach that addresses the uncertainty about the right value to impute (Rubin, 1987) . In this study, five multiply imputed data sets were generated and analyzed in Stata by using standard complete data analysis procedures and combining the results from these analyses."}, {"section_title": "Analysis", "text": "The NELS: 88/2000 survey features data collection through complex survey design which involves stratification, disproportionate sampling of strata, and clustered probability sampling (Curtin, Ingels, Wu, & Heuer, 2002) . As such, Thomas and Heck (2001) suggested that researchers address the representativeness of the sample and the correct assessment of population variances that form the basis for the identification of statistical effects and hypothesis testing. I adjusted for the complex survey design effects associated with NELS: 88/2000 through Stata's survey (svy) commands. I also used the appropriate sampling weight variable (F4F2P2WT) to compensate for unequal probabilities of selection and to adjust for the effects of nonresponse.\nTo answer the research question, I conducted a sequential logistic regression analysis by entering blocks of independent variables in a planned sequence. In the first model, I regressed upward transfer on the sociodemographic variables. In the second model, I included high school preparation variables. I then added the three motivational attributes. External demands and postsecondary enrollment variables were respectively included in subsequent models. This entry approach allowed the researcher to analyze how the effects of variables earlier in the temporal order, such as psychological variables, were mediated by other variables, thus gaining a deeper understanding of how the independent variables exerted their impact on upward transfer. To express the meaning of logistic regression coefficients in a more intuitive way, I reported discrete changes in probability (delta-p) that represent the change in the probability of the outcome under study occurring, accounting for other variables in the model (Peng, So, Stage, & St. John, 2002) ."}, {"section_title": "Limitations of the Study", "text": "This study has important limitations associated with using extant databases. NELS and PETS do not always contain information that addresses a researcher's particular interest. For example, it would be helpful if the datasets contained information on articulation agreements. Prior research has indicated that credit transfer from two-year to fouryear institutions is a serious challenge facing many community college transfer students (Glass & Bunn, 1998) . Many of these students lose some of the credits they earned from the community colleges they attended and thus find it difficult to develop a coherent curriculum of courses at the four-year institutions to which they transfer (Prager, 1993) . It would be interesting to include variables on student experience with articulation agreements between community colleges and four-year institutions in the models to explore whether and/or how they affect student transfer. Unfortunately, this information is not included in the datasets. Another example of limited data is the information regarding remediation variables. PETS reports this information based on students' transcripts throughout their entire postsecondary education as of 2000, thus making it impossible to determine when and where (community colleges or four-year institutions) students took remedial courses. As a result, the study was not able to produce an assessment regarding how remediation predicts upward transfer."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "The sequential logistic regression analysis examined the likelihood of baccalaureate aspirants' transfer to four-year institutions. In Table 3 , the models are organized in a hierarchical fashion.\nModel 1 shows that race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status were both significantly related to upward transfer. Blacks and Hispanics were less likely to transfer compared to Whites. Students in the \"Other\" racial/ethnic category were also at a disadvantage compared to White students, although this effect was marginally significant (p < 0.10). When high school academic preparation variables entered the model, high school test scores positively predicted the probability of upward transfer among baccalaureate aspirants. The addition of the high school preparation variables, shown in Model 2, led to a small decrease in the absolute values of the regression coefficients of the race/ethnicity and SES variables, suggesting that a small proportion of the effect of the socioethnic background characteristics was attributed to the differences in high school preparation. Model 3 added the three psychological attributes, among which selfconcept was a marginally significant predictor of upward transfer. The inclusion of the psychological variables did not account for or mediate much of the effect of other independent variables in the first two blocks. Model 4 included the three variables measuring external demands: being married, being a parent, and work hours, which all indicate a negative effect on upward transfer, with being a parent exerting the largest negative impact. When postsecondary enrollment variables were added in model 5, full-time enrollment and continuous enrollment were both positive and significant predictors of upward transfer. These two variables also seemed to mediate the negative effect of being Hispanic and being \"Other.\" After controlling for enrollment patterns, these racial/ethnic backgrounds were no longer statistically significant. It should be noted that controlling for these variables also increased the magnitude and level of significance of the effect of self-concept on the probability of upward transfer. This suggested a suppressor effect; postsecondary enrollment patterns, namely continuous and full-time enrollment acted as suppressor variables, meaning that with similar clustering among students with higher self-concept and those enrolled full-time and continuously, the full impact of self-concept alone on the likelihood of transfer was suppressed until these enrollment pattern variables were controlled for.\nIn summary, the final and full model included all independent variables simultaneously. Taken together, among baccalaureate-aspiring students beginning at community colleges, the likelihood of transferring to four-year institutions was associated with the following factors: being Black, SES, high school test scores, self-concept, full-time enrollment and continuous enrollment at community colleges, as well as marital and parental status. Specifically, Black students were 23.4% less likely to transfer compared to White students. One quintile increase in SES was associated with 7% more likelihood of transferring. A one-point increase in high school test scores was associated with 1.2% more likelihood of transferring to four-year institutions. With one-point increase on a summated scale ranging from 5-20 measuring self-concept, the likelihood of transfer increased by 2.1%. External demands that influenced student transfer included marital status and parental status. Specifically, students who were married were 20% less likely to transfer compared to students who were not married and students who were parents were 33.1% less likely to transfer compared to students without children. In terms of postsecondary enrollment patterns, students who enrolled full time were 36% more likely to transfer than students who enrolled part time. Similarly, students who enrolled continuously were 31% more likely to transfer to four-year institutions than their counterparts who experienced discontinuous enrollment."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The findings from this study suggest that the upward transfer of baccalaureate aspirants who access postsecondary education through community colleges can be explained by a constellation of various personal, sociological, psychological, and environmental factors, as well as student attendance patterns in postsecondary education.\nAs the SES measure used in this study is a composite of parental education, occupation, and income, the result regarding SES is an estimate of the combined influence of all three factors. Baccalaureate aspirants with higher SES are more likely to successfully transfer to four-year institutions, essentially the first step towards their degree goal, than their counterparts from families of less favorable socioeconomic status. Similar findings have been reported in many previous studies that examined factors related to the probability of transferring from two-year to fouryear colleges (e.g., Bradburn, Hurst, & Peng, 2001; Dougherty & kienzl, 2006; karabel, 1972; velez & Javalgi, 1987) .\nAmong other demographic variables in the model, being Black has a consistently significant negative impact on the probability of transferring to a baccalaureate-granting institution.\n1 This finding is similar to the results of the studies from earlier decades showing that African American students suffer a disadvantage in transferring (e.g., Anderson, 1984; Breneman & Nelson, 1981; Dougherty, 1987; velez & Javalgi, 1987) . However, this result deviates from a more recent study by Roksa (2006) who did not find any significant relationship between being Black and transfer. This discrepancy may be attributed to the difference in analysis samples: This study focuses on baccalaureate aspirants only while Roska's sample includes all students enrolling in community colleges within two years of completing high school. Dougherty and kienzl (2006) suggested that overall, Black students' educational aspirations are higher than white students from similar sociodemographic backgrounds, which would keep the negative impact of being Black on transfer from being significant as it might otherwise be. Given this study's sample restriction, this advantage in educational aspirations among Black students might be reduced and the negative effect of being Black on transfer becomes significant.\nThis study does not find any difference based on gender as earlier studies suggested. This seems to indicate that accounting for precollege and postsecondary variables, it might be the disadvantage in SES, rather than race/ethnicity and gender-with the exception of being Blackthat impedes community college students from transferring (Lee & frank, 1990; Nora & Rendon, 1990) . This confirmed positive correlation between SES and upward transfer highlights the fact that even though the availability of community colleges has provided relatively easy access to postsecondary education for those high school graduates seeking a bachelor's degree or above, sorting by class still seems to exist in community colleges, which might negatively affect many students from more humble social backgrounds, regardless of their gender and race/ethnicity and despite their aspirations that go beyond an education from community colleges.\nGiven the critical role of prior academic achievement in projecting student persistence and degree completion (Pascarella & Terenzini, 1991 , 2005 , the positive relationship between high school test scores and transfer is not surprising, since transfer is arguably a legitimate and essential part of the process of persisting to degree completion for baccalaureate aspirants.\nThe positive relationship between self-concept and the probability of transfer indicates that a more affirmative self-concept is associated with better chances of transfer among baccalaureate aspirants attending community colleges. A first to explore the impact of self-concept on community college transfer, this study confirms the theoretical perspective that self-concept promotes positive behavior and improves performance (Markus & kitayama, 1991) . Specifically, this study suggests that selfconcept may be related to enrollment patterns, as indicated by the suppressor effect of the full-time and continuous enrollment variables, and may have a separate, significant positive relationship with the likelihood of transferring to a four-year institution. This finding is also supported by a modest amount of empirical evidence indicating that self-concept is vital in shaping the transition to college (Hickman, Bartholomae, & Mckenry, 2000) , academic and social adjustment during the first year of college (friedlander, Reid, Shupak, & Cribbie, 2007; Mooney, Sherman, & Lo Presto, 1991) , and student collegiate academic achievement (Pascarella et al., 1987) .\nConsistent with prior research (e.g., Dougherty & kienzl, 2006) , full-time enrollment and continuous enrollment both play a significant, positive role in predicting the probability of transferring to four-year institutions. Indicative of a stronger educational commitment and perhaps less external demands, full-time enrollment and continuous enrollment might also strengthen student academic and social integration into postsecondary education by exposing students more to the academic and social resources available on campus, thus facilitating their progress, which is transfer in this case, in reaching their educational goals.\nBeing married and being a parent both negatively affect transfer. These results confirm existing literature on the determinants of community college transfer (e.g., Dougherty & kienzl, 2006; Roska, 2006) and resonate with research findings on at-risk students indicating that external demands may pull students away from their educational path and influence students' educational decisions (Nora, 2003; Nora, Cabrera, Hagedon, & Pascarella, 1996) ."}, {"section_title": "Implications", "text": "This study's findings point to several important implications for policy and practice. First and foremost, it is pivotal for state legislators and community college leaders to revisit the cooling-out effect of attending community colleges (Clark, 1960) , particularly the effect on those baccalaureate aspirants from underprivileged socioeconomic backgrounds. Although community colleges have extended access to postsecondary education for socioeconomically disadvantaged students who otherwise would not have attended college at all, the sorting mechanism based on class might persist to perpetuate social inequality to some degree, not only between community college and four-year university enrollees, as evidenced by prior research, but also among students who were hoping to use community colleges as an alternative route to the bachelor's degree, as revealed by this study. It is crucial for policy-makers to consider the breadth of the implications of policies and practices intended to promote upward transfer for students with lower socioeconomic status. Students from less favorable socioeconomic backgrounds may also be challenged in the areas of social and cultural capital that are essential to navigating the postsecondary educational system. For students who are seeking an untraditional pathway to the baccalaureate through upward transfer, this system may seem more complicated with various transfer policies and articulation agreements. In addition, socioeconomically disadvantaged students are most in need of financial aid and therefore are most vulnerable when such aid is lacking. Therefore, the development and influence of various policies and programs related to transfer need to be considered in relation to the socioeconomic disparity among students. It leaves the state, the community college, as well as the four-year institution to develop feasible plans and initiatives that aim at sustaining the educational aspirations of students from more humble socioeconomic backgrounds.\nJust as important is the finding that self-concept, as a motivational attribute, is positively associated with baccalaureate aspirants' transfer, which illuminates the importance of helping students develop positive self-concept. Community colleges should focus on identifying and developing programs and services that promote positive self-concept among students. In this regard, initiatives that foster close and quality contact between students and various community college socialization sources such as faculty, peers, and counselors are likely to be beneficial, as such interactions help promote positive self-concept among college students (Drew, 2001; komarraju, Musulkin, & Bhattacharya, 2010; Lamport, 1993) . for example, based on single institution data, komarraju, Musulkin, & Bhattacharya (2010) found that first-year baccalaureate students who perceive their faculty members as being approachable, respectful, and available for frequent interactions outside the classroom are more likely to report high academic self-concept. A much larger scale study conducted by Plecha (2002) using the Cooperative Institutional Research Program (CIRP) data showed that among four-year students, the frequency of student faculty interaction positively affects academic self-confidence, after controlling for student incoming characteristics. focusing on financially disadvantaged and first-generation four-year college students, who may resemble more their community college counterparts, Grant-Vallone, Reid, Umali, and Pohlert (2004) found that those who more frequently utilize student support and counseling services report higher self-esteem and exhibited better academic and social adjustment. Granted, unlike most four-year institutions, community colleges are predominately commuter campuses and student interactions with faculty, peers, and staff might be structurally constrained. However, such socialization opportunities are still critical, as although limited, research focusing on community college students has demonstrated the benefits of such interactions on self-concept. For example, in the case of high-risk community college students, first-semester skills seminars, academic advising, and programs to promote peer interactions have been shown to improve student self-concept (Townsend & Twombly, 2001 ).\nIn addition, because an individual's self-concept is constantly influenced by reinforcements and attributions for the individual's own behavior (Marsh & Hattie, 1996) , community college faculty and staff should help cultivate in students who wish to transfer the belief that their choice of a community college education is a legitimate and effective route to the baccalaureate degree, and that their successful transfer can be largely determined by their own efforts, self-initiation, and selfdirection. At the same time, academic advisors and counselors should place an emphasis on clearly explaining the transfer process, articulation policies, and the academic practices and expectations at four-year institutions. They should also assist students to become more cognizant of available campus support and counseling programs and services at both two-year and four-year institutions designed to help students meet those expectations.\nThe result indicating that high school test scores significantly predict baccalaureate aspirants' upward transfer once again pinpoints the core status of academic performance in education and its potential influence on virtually every aspect and dynamic of one's postsecondary career. Therefore, focusing on student learning may offer a helpful approach to facilitating students in achieving their educational goals (Wang, 2009) .\nThe findings regarding enrollment patterns may suggest the need to promote stronger enrollment intensity. Mandatory requirement for fulltime enrollment during particular semesters, as practiced in many institutions, is only one of the possible approaches that encourage stronger enrollment intensity. Since part-time students may face competing demands with work or family or may be unable to afford full-time enrollment (Goldrick-Rab, 2010), it is more important to offer a wider choice of courses and more flexibility in scheduling for students who might be otherwise constrained by external demands and work schedules from participating in learning full time. Additionally, institutional efforts should be directed at promoting learning and a sense of learning community. These efforts should particularly reach out to and involve part-time students, because it might be factors associated with full-time enrollment (e.g., a stronger sense of community, stronger institutional commitment, and more interactions with students and faculty), rather than full-time enrollment per se, that facilitates student learning and promotes desirable educational outcomes. If the opportunities that help develop learning communities and academic socializations are made more available to part-time students, the potential negative effect of attending part-time might be alleviated."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Students who access postsecondary education through community colleges affect the development of the missions of the institutions they attend, two-year or four-year, not only by the very unique characteristics they have, but also by the educational goals and aspirations they embrace (Wang, 2009) . The most prominent of these goals is arguably to attain a bachelor's degree by transferring to a four-year institution. This study shows that upward transfer of baccalaureate aspirants is associated with socioeconomic background, being Black, self-concept, high school achievement, external demands, and postsecondary enrollment patterns. These findings are useful information for community colleges in providing effective educational practices to help these students move further towards their degree goals.\nAs college tuitions keep climbing upward, community colleges are likely to increasingly become the entry into postsecondary education for many disadvantaged students. How well community colleges respond to the needs of and challenges facing their students is going to be tested in the days to come. Nonetheless, continued efforts to facilitate the transfer process and promote the long-term educational success for baccalaureate aspirants represent one of the important approaches to addressing the broader issues of educational access and equity."}, {"section_title": "Note", "text": ""}]
