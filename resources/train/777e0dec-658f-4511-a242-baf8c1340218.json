[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The total extreme water level (TEWL) at a location during a storm event determines whether waves will impact topsides and supporting beams of an offshore structure at that location, causing large structural loads of considerable concern. Since TEWL is the sum of mean sea level, tide, storm surge and wave crest elevation, a joint model for extremes of all of these components is required in order to predict its extremal characteristics well. The physics of mean sea level, tide and surge has been studied for decades (e.g. Pugh 1987), as has that of wind waves (e.g. Kinsman 2012). Considerable attention has also been devoted to estimation of storm surge during tropical storms (e.g. Needham et al. 2015) and extra-tropical storms (e.g. Bernier and Thompson 2006), and the interaction between surge and tide (e.g. Horsburgh and Wilson 2007, Olbert et al. 2013, Williams et al. 2016. Physically, storm surge is a large-scale increase in sea level due to a storm, lasting from hours to days over areas of hundreds of km 2 . The magnitude of storm surge is influenced by many physical processes, and those same processes control surge in both extra-tropical and tropical cyclones. Atmospheric pressure differences in ocean storms cause the water level in the open ocean to rise in regions of relatively low atmospheric pressure; Harris (1963) estimated an increase in sea level of the order of 1cm for every hPa reduction in atmospheric pressure. High wind stress at the sea surface and the horizontal gradient of atmospheric pressure are other important contributors, as is storm intensity and trajectory. In shallow and coastal waters, bathymetry and topography become important. In regions of high tidal range, the joint occurrence of storm and tidal high water is sometimes referred to as \"storm-tide\". The SLOSH model of hurricane surge (Jelesnianski et al. 1992) predicts the maximum envelope of water at a location given hurricane characteristics such as central pressure, storm size, forward motion, track and maximum sustained winds. However, the SLOSH model does not explicitly model the aggregate impact of surge and crest. Bernier and Thompson (2006) seeks to predict the frequency of storm surges and extreme sea levels in the north-west Atlantic using a 2-D non-linear barotropic ocean model to construct a 40-year hindcast for the region. Where tide-surge interactions exist, they lead to lower total water levels than in the case of independence. The degree of decrease varies with extent of dependence, magnitude of surge peak at a particular phase of tide and the distribution of peaks over a tidal cycle. Coles and Tawn (2005a) identify strong seasonal effects in measurements of extreme surges at locations on the eastern coastline of the United Kingdom. Subsequently Coles and Tawn (2005b) propose a Bayesian model for extreme surge, and outline a procedure to estimate the distribution of the sum of surge and tide. The effect of future climate on North Sea storm surge is also of considerable interest (e.g. Gaslikova et al. 2013;Vousdoukas et al. 2017). Butler et al. (2007a) conduct trend estimation in synthetic storm surges. Butler et al. (2007b) reports extreme value analysis of decadal variation in storm surges, including a discussion of the effect of North Atlantic oscillation and tide-surge interaction. The joint statistics of extreme storm surge and sea state severity at an arbitrary location in the ocean has also received some attention (e.g. Hawkes et al. 2002, Rueda et al. 2016and Mazas and Hamm 2017. The objective of the current work is to establish a statistical model for surge characteristics conditional on the occurrence of extreme values of significant wave height (H S ). Methods of multivariate extreme value analysis are required to describe the joint characteristics of extremes of multiple variables. The conditional extremes model of Heffernan and Tawn (2004) provides a flexible estimation framework. Given that the characteristics of extreme H S at a location vary systematically with covariates such as storm direction, it is likely that the joint statistics of surge and H S are non-stationary with respect to covariates. Extensions to the conditional extremes model, such as Jonathan et al. (2014) allow estimation of multivariate extremal dependence in the presence of covariates, and hence estimation of tails of distributions of structure variables and design contours of interest. The conditional extremes model is motivated by an asymptotic form for the limiting conditional distribution of one or more conditioned random variables given a large value of a conditioning variable. An outline of the approach is given by Jonathan et al. (2010) in application to wave spectral characteristics. Conditions for the asymptotic argument to hold have been explored by Heffernan and Resnick (2007). An alternative to the conditional extremes model is a suitable extreme value copula (e.g. Gudendorf and Segers (2010)). Bender et al. (2014) and Serafin and Ruggiero (2014) propose bivariate extreme value models incorporating nonstationary marginal and dependence inference. The main advantage of the conditional extremes model compared with models such as those of Bender et al. (2014) and Serafin and Ruggiero (2014) is that the former incorporates a full class of asymptotic extremal dependence, and also allows relatively straightforward extension to higher dimensions. The layout of the article is as follows. Section 2 introduces the North Sea application, and illustrates the data used in this work. Section 3 describes the piecewise stationary extreme value model; mathematical detail corresponding to the model are given in the Appendix. A conditional model for surge characteristics given extreme storm peak H S is established in Section 4. Section 5 provides discussion and conclusions."}, {"section_title": "Motivating application", "text": "Data for the current work comes from two sources. The first is measurements of sea surface elevation at four offshore platforms in the North Sea using SAAB Rex wave radars. Measurements were taken at one location in the northern and central North Sea, and two locations in the southern North Sea (henceforth referred to as NNS, CNS, SNS1 and SNS2 for brevity). At each location, harmonic analysis of surface elevation time-series identified mean sea level, tidal variation and a non-tidal residual component interpreted as \"surge\" in the current work (see, e.g. Pugh 1987). Significant wave height H S for sea states of 30 minutes duration was also estimated from the surface elevation time-series. Between 12 and 16 years of measurements were available each of the NNS, CNS, SNS1 and SNS2 locations. The second data source is the WAM North Sea hindcast (Reistad et al. 2009), from which time-series of wave direction corresponding to the surface elevation timeseries at the four locations were extracted. Knowledge of wave direction is essential for reasonable characterisation of extreme storms in the North Sea; wave direction is used as a covariate in the analysis below. Time-series of sea state H S was then used to identify storm events, following the approach described in Ewans and Jonathan (2008); a total of between 1000 and 1100 storms were isolated at each of the NNS, CNS, SNS1 and SNS2 locations. For each storm event, (a) storm peak H S , (b) wave direction at the time of storm peak, referred to as storm peak direction \u03b8, and (c) time-series of surge for the duration of the storm, referred to \"the surge trajectory\" were isolated. Figure 1 shows typical surge trajectories for each of the four locations. The relative importance of surge effects is known to vary between the four locations. In the northern North Sea, surge generally makes a small contribution to severe seas, whereas the surge contribution is generally larger in the southern North Sea. Figure 1 suggests that the magnitude of surge increases with decreasing latitude in the North Sea. The relative importance of surge in the estimation of TEWL is therefore clearly greater for locations SNS1 and SNS2. Figure 1 also shows that the lengths of storms, and hence of surge trajectories, varies considerably within and between locations. Moreover, it is clear that the time of maximum surge does not typically coincide with the time of peak storm severity, corresponding to zero on the x-axis in Figure 1. [ Figure 1 about here.] For simplicity, each surge trajectory was next summarised in terms of four statistics for subsequent extreme value analysis, namely the maximum value (SrgMxm), the negative of the minimum value, (SrgNgtMnm), the median value (SrgMdn) and the range (SrgRng) of values per surge trajectory. We chose to model the negative of minimum surge since this shows non-negative dependence with increasing storm severity. Storm peak H S is known to vary with storm peak direction \u03b8, and the importance of accommodating this non-stationary in extreme value models has been established. For this reason, each bivariate sample of storm peak H S and surge characteristic was partitioned by inspection of plots and consideration of likely fetch effects into covariate intervals (or directional sector for the current covariate) within which distributions of storm peak H S and surge characteristic were found to be approximately stationary. Figure 2 shows scatter plots of the maximum surge SrgMxm observed per storm event against storm peak H S per covariate interval for each of the four locations. Four covariate intervals were used for the NNS location, and three elsewhere. There are noteworthy differences between the characteristics of the various scatter plots. For SNS2, SrgMxm increases with storm peak H S for directional sector [240, 0) to values above 1m. However, for the other two directional sectors, the mean value of SrgMxm corresponding to large H S appears to be around zero. [ Figure 2 about here.] Figure 3 shows scatter plots of SrgRng on storm peak H S per directional sector per location. Again, there are differences between scatter plots due to location and storm direction. [ Figure 3 about here.] Extreme value analysis of the samples of SrgMxm, SrgNgtMnm, SrgMdn, SrgRng, storm peak H S and direction \u03b8 per location is discussed in Section 4."}, {"section_title": "The piecewise stationary extreme value model", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Overview", "text": "Consider a sample\u1e0a = {\u1e8f i1 ,\u1e8f i2 } n i=1 of n pairs of values of peaks over threshold for a conditioning variate\u1e8e 1 > 0, and an associated conditioned variate\u1e8e 2 > 0. Further, let {x i } n i=1 be the corresponding values of a covariate X on some domain X ; in this work, we assume a single directional covariate with X = [0 \u2022 , 360 \u2022 ).

In practice, threshold \u03c8 might correspond to a local quantile of the sample given covariate with specified non-exceedance probability \u03c4 \u2208 (0, 1) estimated using non-stationary quantile regression. In practice, plots of parameter estimates from models corresponding to different thresholds aid the selection of \u03c4 per variable showing appropriate behaviour, including approximate stability of the estimate of \u03be for thresholds larger than the chosen \u03c4 . Parameter estimates for \u03be, \u03c3 and \u03c8 per variable are all in general functions of covariate X. Fitted marginal models are used to transform the variables\u1e8e 1 and\u1e8e 2 to Y 1 and Y 2 on standard Gumbel scale, and hence sample\u1e0a to D, using the probability integral transform. Then we fit a conditional extremes model for Y 2 |Y 1 , X for various choices of high threshold \u03c6 \u2208 R for the conditioning variate Y 1 , retaining the estimated model parameters and residuals. \u03c6 is typically a quantile of the standard Gumbel distribution with non-exceedance probability \u03ba \u2208 (0, 1). Plots of model parameter estimates and residual distributions for different threshold choices aid selection of \u03ba consistent with modelling assumptions. The conditional extremes model form is (Y 2 |Y 1 = y, X = x) = \u03b1y + y \u03b2 W for y > \u03c6, where \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1] and \u03b2 \u2208 (\u2212\u221e, 1]. W is a random variable with unknown distribution, the density of which we estimate using residuals from the fitted model. For fitting purposes only, we assume that W \u223c N (\u00b5, \u03b6 2 ) with \u00b5 \u2208 R and \u03b6 2 > 0. The model fitting procedure corresponds to estimating {\u03b1, \u03b2, \u00b5, \u03b6} given a sample of values for Y 1 , Y 2 , X and threshold \u03c6. All of \u03c6, \u03b1, \u03b2, \u00b5 and \u03b6 are in general functions of covariate X.

Estimation of marginal extreme value models for the North Sea application is discussed in Section 4.1. We note that transformation to Laplace scale provides a useful alternative to Gumbel transformation, especially when considering negative tail dependence (e.g. Keef et al. 2013)."}, {"section_title": "Conditional extremes", "text": "The Gumbel-scale sample D = {y i1 , y i2 } above some threshold of the conditioning variate Y 1 is used to estimate a conditional extremes model with parameters \u03b1 k \u2208 [0, 1] and \u03b2 \u2208 (\u2212\u221e, 1] given by where W \u223c N (\u00b5, \u03b6 2 ) with \u00b5 \u2208 R and \u03b6 2 > 0 is assumed for model estimation only.

Note that, since identifying \u03b2 is particularly problematic, it is assumed constant (but unknown) across covariate intervals. Similarly, since they are intended to describe a generic residual structure, both \u00b5 and \u03b6 2 are also assumed to be stationary with respect to covariate. Once more, the reasonableness of these modelling assumptions is assessed by inspection of diagnostic plots.

The Gumbel-scale sample D b is then used to estimate the conditional extremes model for thresholds of the conditioning variate corresponding with non-exceedance probabilities \u03ba \u2208 I \u03ba . Inspection of fit residuals (Figure 8) and parameter stability with \u03ba ( Figure 10) suggested setting I \u03ba = [0.55, 0.65] for SrgMxm on H S at the CNS location. With this choice, the characteristics of residuals {r h } (see Appendix) are illustrated in Figure 8. The left hand panel suggests that residuals are centred around zero, with a unimodal distribution showing a longer right hand tail. The right hand panel suggests that the distribution of residuals is approximately stationary with respect to \u03b8. These diagnostic plots suggest that the piecewise stationary model framework, with \u03b2, \u00b5 and \u03b6 constant with respect to \u03b8, is reasonable. [ Figure 8 about here.] Parameter estimates for the conditional extremes model are shown in Figure 9; only slope parameter \u03b1 (= {\u03b1 k }) varies between intervals in the piecewise stationary model. The top left panel summarises \u03b1 in terms of bootstrap median and 95% uncertainty bands per as a function of \u03b8. There is evidence that \u03b1 is lower for the covariate interval [45,150] (corresponding to the land-shadow of mainland Europe) than elsewhere. The estimate of \u03b1 is considerably less than unity everywhere, suggesting that SrgMxm and H S show asymptotic independence (e.g. Eastoe et al. 2013). The estimate of scale exponent parameter \u03b2 is centred around 0.3, suggesting that the width of the distribution of SrgMxm given H S increases with increasing H S . Residual mean \u00b5 and scale \u03b6 are centred around 0.2 and 1.1. [ Figure 9 about here.] Figure 10 explores the stability of estimates for {\u03b1 k } and \u03b2 as a function of conditional extremes threshold non-exceedance probability \u03ba \u2208 I \u03ba . Estimates for \u03b1 k in each covariate interval, and \u03b2 are all stationary to within bootstrap uncertainty, suggesting that a reasonable choice of I \u03ba has been made. [ Figure 10 about here.]"}, {"section_title": "Marginal and conditional return values", "text": "From an engineering perspective, the main inferences from the current analysis are estimates for marginal and conditional return values corresponding to some long return period T . Typically, these are obtained by Monte Carlo simulation under the models outlined in Sections 3.1 and 3.2. Specifying a Monte Carlo scheme, even for relatively complex simulations, is generally straightforward. When T is small (of the order of 100 years, say), simulation is also computationally easy: Monte Carlo estimation might therefore be preferred. When T is large however, with T = 10 7 years of interest for some analysis, Monte Carlo simulation becomes computationally tedious and demanding. In these circumstances, numerical integration schemes yield dramatic reductions in the computational complexity of return value estimation, as outlined in Ross et al. (2017). Specification of the numerical integration scheme usually requires some effort (as illustrated in the Appendix for the current work), but computationally this effort pays dividends. We use numerical integration to estimate cumulative distribution functions for marginal and conditional return values as follows: we estimate (a) the marginal return value distributions F M 1k and F M 2k for a T -year return period of\u1e8e 1 and\u1e8e 2 per covariate interval C k , (b) the corresponding \"omnidirectional\" return value distributions F M 1 and F M 2 over all covariate intervals, (c) the conditional return value distribution F 2|M 1k of\u1e8e 2 given the occurrence of a T -year event of\u1e8e 1 in covariate interval C k , and (d) the conditional return value distribution F 2|M 1 of\u1e8e 2 given the occurrence of an omni-directional T -year event of\u1e8e 1 (regardless of the covariate interval in which the T -year event of\u1e8e 1 occurs). Details of the numerical integration schemes used to estimate (a)-(d) are given in the Appendix; estimates of the different return value distributions for the North Sea application are illustrated in Section 4.3.\nUsing the numerical integration approach outlined in Section 3.3 and the Appendix, marginal and conditional return values were estimated for a T = 100 year return period. The left hand panel of Figure 11 gives estimates for the marginal omni-directional 100-year return value distribution F M 1 of storm peak H S at each of the NNS (red), CNS (green), SNS1 (cyan) and SNS2 (purple) locations. The median 100-year return value is approximately 15m for NNS, 12m for CNS and 4m for SNS1 and SNS2 as might be expected. The return value distributions are of course rather broad, reflecting both inherent aleatory uncertainty as well as epistemic uncertainty (estimated by bootstrapping); for example, we would not be too surprised to observe 100-year return values of storm peak H S at the NNS location in excess of 17m. The centre and right hand panels of the figure give the corresponding omni-directional marginal (F M 2 , solid) and conditional (F 2|M 1 , dashed) return value estimates, one panel for each of the four surge characteristics of interest. For SrgMxm (top centre of Figure 11), marginal surge is greatest in the southern North Sea, with median 100-year values approaching 2m, compared with approximately 1m at CNS and 0.5m at NNS; these observations are consistent with the trends in Figure 2 and physical intuition. It is noteworthy however that the conditional distribution of SrgMxm given the occurrence of omni-directional 100-year H S yields considerably lower estimates; for NNS and CNS, the median conditional surge is approximately zero. However, for SNS the median conditional surge remains at around 1.5m, approximately 80% of the marginal 100-year maximum surge of 1.8m. This demonstrates that consideration of surge (and conditional surge in particular) is much more important for design in extreme seas of this region of the North Sea. Characteristics of the corresponding return value distributions for SrgMdn, SrgNgtMnm and SrgRng are generally rather similar. Of particular interest is the fact that the conditional distributions of SrgNgtMnm at SNS1 and SNS2 are considerably to the left of corresponding marginal distributions; this is not the case for other surge characteristics. [ Figure 11 about here.] Figure 11 shows that differences exist between omni-directional marginal and corresponding conditional return value distributions. Figure 12 illustrates, at the CNS location, that directional marginal and conditional return value distributions have interesting differences also. The top panel for the figure gives directional marginal return value distributions {F M 1k } for (storm peak) H S for T = 100 years, together with the omni-directional distribution (F M 1 , black). The omni-directional return value almost coincides with the directional distribution for the \u03b8 \u2208 [45, 150) covariate interval. Return values for the two remaining covariate intervals are smaller. The second panel shows that the omni-directional return value distribution for SrgMxm has large contributions from all covariate intervals except for \u03b8 \u2208 [45, 150). This has an interesting effect on the location of the omni-directional conditional return value distribution (dashed black). Because the most severe storms correspond to \u03b8 \u2208 [45, 150), for which SrgMxm is relatively small, the omni-directional conditional return value distribution is itself similar to that for the [45, 150) covariate interval, with median value around 0.1m. However, the conditional return value distributions of SrgMxm for covariate intervals [270,45) and [150,270) are considerably to the right of the omni-directional conditional distribution. Informally, we might interpret this information for design in the following manner. For estimation of TEWL (ignoring mean sea level and tide) omni-directionally, H S has a 100-year median of around 11.3m, to which a median associated SrgMxm contribution of 0.1m is added, yielding TEWL of 11.4m. However, for the [270, 45) covariate interval, H S has a median return value of approximately 10.0m, to which a median associated SrgMxm contribution of 0.5m is added, yielding TEWL of 10.5m. That is, SrgMxm makes a greater associated contribution to TEWL in covariate interval [270, 45) than it does omni-directionally. We also see, informally, that naive addition of median omni-directional marginal H S of around 11.3m to median omni-directional marginal SrgMxm of around 1.1m yields TEWL of 12.4m; this estimate is 1.0m larger that the more realistic estimate based on median marginal H S and median associated SrgMxm.

The piecewise stationary generalised Pareto model is applied independently to threshold exceedances for each variable, with thresholds per variable specified as quantiles of the marginal distribution per directional interval of \u03b8, with non-exceedance probabilities \u03c4 1 \u2208 I \u03c4 1 and \u03c4 2 \u2208 I \u03c4 2 . Intervals I \u03c4 1 , I \u03c4 2 were specified by inspection of diagnostic plots for model adequacy over a wide range of values of \u03c4 (e.g. Figure 7), as discussed below. [ Figure 4 about here.] Figures 4(a, d) show estimated thresholds for H S and SrgMxm in terms of bootstrap median and 95% uncertainty bands (over n BS = 500 bootstrap resamples of the original sample, with I \u03c4 1 = [0.7, 0.8] and I \u03c4 2 = [0.65, 0.75]). The original sample is shown in terms of threshold exceedances (black) and non-exceedances (grey). For H S , there appears to be little variability in threshold level across covariate intervals, The largest two H S events correspond to storms emanating from the east. The threshold for SrgMxm shows clearer directional variability. Surge effects are larger when storms emanate from approximately the south, and are smaller for storms from the east. For each bootstrap resample of each variable, generalised Pareto models are estimated. Figures 4(b, e) give bootstrap distributions for the estimated generalised Pareto shape parameter \u03be, set constant with respect to \u03b8. For storm peak H S , \u03be is centred at approximately -0.15; but for SrgMxm, the bootstrap distribution is centred at approximately zero, indicating that the distribution of SrgMxm has a longer tail than that of H S . Figures 4(c, f) show the estimate for generalised Pareto scale parameter \u03c3 in terms of its bootstrap median and 95% uncertainty band per covariate interval. For H S , the estimate for \u03c3 is larger in the covariate interval corresponding to largest values of H S . For SrgMxm, the estimate of \u03c3 is lower in the sector corresponding to smaller values of SrgMxm. To confirm model fit, tail diagnostic plots such as those illustrated in Figures 5 and 6 for H S and SrgMxm are inspected. Figure 5 shows that the tail of empirical distribution of H S from the sample is in agreement with the estimated generalised Pareto tail, represented in terms of a bootstrap median and 95% uncertainty band, for each covariate interval and \"omni-directionally\" over all covariate intervals (in the bottom right hand plot of Figure 5). It is important also to establish that the estimate for generalised Pareto shape \u03be is approximately constant with threshold for all thresholds corresponding to intervals I \u03c4 1 , I \u03c4 2 . Figure 7 shows this variation for the SrgMxm model as a function of threshold non-exceedance probability \u03c4 2 . For values of \u03c4 2 \u2208 [0.65, 0.75], the estimate of \u03be appears to be constant for larger values of \u03c4 2 to within bootstrap uncertainty. For this reason, we set I \u03c4 2 = [0.65, 75] for marginal modelling of SrgMxm at the CNS location. Diagnostic plots such as those illustrated in Figures 5-7 were inspected to confirm adequacy of marginal fits for H S and all surge characteristics at all locations. [ Figure 7 about here.]"}, {"section_title": "Discussion and conclusions", "text": "In this work, we examine the statistical properties of storm surge in extreme North Sea storms using a non-stationary conditional extreme value model consisting of a set of coupled piecewise stationary models on a partition of the domain of a storm direction covariate. We find evidence for variation of marginal and conditional extreme surge characteristics with storm direction and location. In particular, we provide an efficient numerical integration algorithm to estimate marginal and conditional return value distributions of surge characteristics. Sampling and threshold selection uncertainties are incorporated within inferences using a bootstrapping scheme. The piecewise stationary model appears to be adequate in terms of its complexity for the samples examined here; the whole modelling procedure can be completed for one surge characteristic at one location in approximately 5 minutes. The approach requires specification of covariate partition {C k } prior to analysis. In the current work, choice of covariate partition boundaries was informed by inspection of data, and elementary physical understanding of likely directional effects on significant wave height and surge at each location. Sensitivity of inferences to small changes in locations of partition boundaries was investigated empirically, and found generally to be small. An improved procedure for specification of the covariate partition could be considered, including estimation of the partition boundaries (and in principle the number of boundaries) as part of the extreme value inference. This was not attempted here, to avoid introducing undue complexity in model estimation. Extension of the piecewise stationary model to higher p-dimensional covariates (p > 1) is relatively straightforward: simply define {C k } as a partition of the covariate domain in p-dimensions. For the typical size n and quality of samples available for analysis, identification of models with p > 2 is likely to be problematic. We anticipate that inclusion of season at covariate may be of benefit. Currently, the marginal directional threshold for H S effectively eliminates all but winter storms. Adopting a directional-seasonal threshold (and piecewise stationary model) might provide the opportunity to examine seasonality in more detail. Inferences concerning key surge characteristics such as SrgMxm, SrgMdn and SrgNgtMnm can be used to forecast a complete surge trajectory s * (t) for some interval of time t corresponding to an extreme storm with specified storm peak H S and direction \u03b8. We might choose to do this by adjusting a historical surge trajectory s(t) for a storm with similar H S and \u03b8 linearly using where s \u2212 , s o and s + are (negative) SrgNgtMnm, SrgMdn and SrgMxm for the selected historical surge trajectory, and s * \u2212 , s * o and s * + are the corresponding quantities for the forecast surge trajectory, estimated jointly using the piecewise stationary model. An alternative strategy would be to estimate a model similar to that of Winter and Tawn (2016) and Winter and Tawn (2017) for the growth and decay of surge in time with respect to its maximum value in an extreme storm. In this case, the piecewise stationary model would be used to estimate the surge maximum relative to which surge decays (forwards and backwards in time), and the surge minimum necessary for estimating a threshold below which the surge trajectory should not extend. The method introduced here is applicable to estimation of conditional characteristics of (in principle arbitrary numbers of) environmental variables. It can be used for specification of associated design conditions for (e.g.) wind speed or peak wave period given extreme H S , and in the construction of design contours (e.g. Huseby et al. 2015, Vanem 2017). The method is currently being used to estimate surge characteristics for extreme storms in other ocean basins. further thank Vadim Anokhin (Shell), Jonathan Tawn (Lancaster University, UK), Stan Tendijck (Technical University of Delft, The Netherlands) and Yanyun Wu (Shell) for their support.
