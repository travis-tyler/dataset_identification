To 87 Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) were first reported in the mid-1960s when two species were 88 isolated from persons with the common cold: HCoV-229E [12] and HCoV-OC43 [13] . Since then, 89 seven different types of CoVs had been detected from humans, three of them happened to be highly . 105 A few months ago, a novel CoV emerged and caused a serious disaster across the whole world. 106 During the last two months of 2019, several cases of 'viral pneumonia' in Wuhan, People's 107 Republic of China, were reported [17, 18] . The cause of this infectious disease was identified as a 108 natural virus of an animal origin with spillover infection potential [19] . It was traced that the 109 geographical source of this virus was Huanan South China Seafood Market, but the actual animal 110 source of this CoV was not known. It is now thought that this virus came from bats as their primary Since the first confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 in China, more than 74.30 million people 121 have been affected, from which more than 1.67 million lives have been claimed 122 (https://covid19.who.int/, assessed on December 19, 2020 ). Although more than 52 million people 123 have defeated COVID-19 and recovered from the disease, yet the battle between SARS-CoV-2 124 and humans is continued, and still, no specific therapeutics are available. The United States of 125 America (USA) shares 22.7% of total infection cases, followed by India and Brazil, sharing 13.5% 126 and 9.6% of cases, respectively (https://covid19.who.int/, assessed on December 19, 2020) ( Figure   127 1). Although a decrease in death rate is observed (September 10, 3.22; July 20, 6.65%; April 10, 128 22.36% and Feb 2, 41.80%), there is no substantial reduction in active COVID-19 cases 129 (>700,000daily cases on December 19, 2020). The cumulative incidences for COVID-19 vary by 130 a multitude of factors, including comorbidities, age, gender, health and living conditions [21, 22] ."}, {"section_title": "138", "text": "In the USA, the situation is still aggravating, where COVID-19 death toll is over 300, 000 and the 139 rate is still rising as 95 deaths per 100,000 since January 2020, across the country 140 (https: //www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 //www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/ -ncov, accessed December 20, 2020 Several genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 retrieved from the COVID-19 patients have been 183 reported by researchers from various countries.

The single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome of 187 SARS-CoV-2 is around ~30 kb that starts with a 5\u2032-cap structure and ends with a 3\u2032-poly-A tail. The initial attachment of the virus to the host cell is mediated by S protein, which has two subunits, 203 S1 (specific receptor binding domain known as RBD) and S2 (CoV S2 glycoprotein). S protein, 204 through its specific RBD, binds to its receptor on the host cell [47] . Wan et al. [48] reported that 205 SARS-CoV-2 is optimized to bind on angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) human receptors."}, {"section_title": "206", "text": "RBD in the S protein is the most variable part, and it differs for each type of CoV. After binding 207 to the receptor, the host protease cleaves the S protein, which causes the release of the spike fusion sore throat to high fever, GI distress, diarrhea, nausea, myalgia, dyspnea, lymphopenia, difficulty 254 in breathing and pneumonia [67] [68] [69] [70] . Unfortunately, COVID-19 symptoms, at the initial stage 255 cannot make the basis for diagnosis as they mimic many respiratory and common infections (Table   256 1).

They proposed that this virus-like particle would force the immune 412 system of humans to produce antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Overall, without approved and 413 specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs and vaccines, it is very difficult to treat the patients with severe COVID-19, so currently, the main focus during the treatment of COVID-19 patients is to 415 maintain the functions of patients' organs.
