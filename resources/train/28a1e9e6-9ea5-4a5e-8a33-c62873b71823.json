[{"section_title": "", "text": "The economics literature has not settled on a consistent definition of entrepreneurship. Several researchers, mostly labor economists, define entrepreneurship as self employment (Evans and Leighton 1989;Blanchflower and Oswald 1998;Hamilton 2000). Lazear (2005) refines this definition to be incorporated selfemployment. Baumol (1968Baumol ( , 1990Baumol ( , 2004 links innovation with entrepreneurship, using the two terms interchangeably. In keeping with the dictionary, Reynolds, Carter, Gartner and Greene (2004) using the Panel Survey of Entrepreneurial Dynamics (PSED), define an entrepreneur as a person engaged in starting a business as does Audretsch and several of his coauthors. However, the employment status of the person starting the business is unclear. An entrepreneur can potentially be working two jobs-one to pay the bills and the other the start of an independent venture. This suggests that measuring entrepreneurship as selfemployment may be too narrow a definition. Indeed, Leonard (2008) shows that the PSED definition and the self-employment definition of entrepreneurship lead to significantly different estimates. The burgeoning literature on academic entrepreneurship most often defines entrepreneurial activity as patent applications and patents granted (see for example, Stephan, Gurmu, Sumell, and Black 2005;Stuart 2004, 2005;Fabrizio and DiMinin 2005;Murray and Stern 2005. One notable exception is Toole and Czarnitzki 2005). Others have examined the spillovers between academic science, innovation, and entrepreneurship. Chukumba and Jensen (2005) develop a model that predicts that university inventions are more likely to be commercialized in entrepreneurial start-ups than in established companies. Using data from University Technology managers they confirm the predictions of the model. Branstetter and Ogura (2005) find that the bioscience industry is more likely to cite academic patents and papers in the 1990s. Zucker, Darby, and their collaborators [Zucker, Darby, et. al.] take a more nuanced approach and examine the involvement of star academic scientists in firm formation. They posit that start scientists are important for technology transfer and firm success (Zucker, Darby, and Brewer 1998;Armstrong 1998, 2002;Zucker and Darby 2006). Clearly, defining academic entrepreneurship as patent applications or patents granted is problematic for several reasons. First, the patent application is the initial step in a long process of introducing innovations to the marketplace through commercialization. Second, the 1980 Bayh-Dole Act changed the incentives for universities to patent scientific discoveries. Thus, it may be the institution instead of the scientist who initializes the patent process. Third, not all patent applications are granted, and once granted, not all patents are commercialized. Given the hurdles researchers face between the patent application and profitable commercial venture, I argue that patent applications and grants are more appropriately measures of innovation. Instead, the commercialization of a patent is most closely associated with an actual business venture, and I will examine this empirically in the paper. Even using commercialization as a measure of academic entrepreneurship presents its own problems. Commercialization may take the form of licensing where the researcher signs over the rights to an unrelated firm. Thus, the researcher is not an entrepreneur per se. Alternatively, if the researcher is actively involved in the commercialization process, he or she may be working as a consultant to the venture that commercializes the discovery or starting a business. Thus, this study uses an indicator of whether an individual has a second job as a measure of academic entrepreneurship. This approach is related to that taken by Zucker, Darby et. al. who examine the success of firms associated with star academic researchers. As the above discussion indicates, entrepreneurship, as defined in the literature takes on different meanings in different contexts. In addition, much of the literature on innovation has focused on the academy, despite the fact that Morgan, Kruytbosch, and Kannankutty (2001) show that patenting and commercialization rates among scientists are much higher in industry than the academic sector. This paper contributes to the literature on innovation and entrepreneurship by providing sector-specific definitions of entrepreneurial activity and linking these measures to innovation. Entrepreneurship can take many forms in the industry sector ranging from nascent entrepreneurs who have second jobs, to the person employed in a new business, to the incorporated self-employed. Academics, by definition, are not selfemployed, but do engage in the entrepreneurial activities of second jobs which may or may not be related to the commercialization of patents. This study uses three waves of the Survey of Doctorate Recipients to explore the linkages between innovation and entrepreneurship among US Ph.D. scientists in the academic and industry sectors. The analysis begins by investigating factors associated with patenting in the academic and industry sectors. I examine the demographic, employer, and productivity characteristics associated with publications and patents in both sectors. In part, I evaluate Baumol's hypothesis that a substantial number of inventions take place in small firms. Zucker, Darby et. al. argue that academic \"stars\" in terms of publications are closely related to startups, and I investigate this association by estimating the effect of publications and patents on having a second job as an academic. These associations will indicate whether innovation is correlated with entrepreneurship. The analysis continues with an examination of the causal relationship between innovation and entrepreneurship. Using the panel data to control for individual fixed effects, I examine whether patent applications, patent grants, and patent commercialization are associated with self-employment and other measures of entrepreneurial activity in the industry sector. In the academic sector, I examine whether patent applications, patent grants, and patent commercialization are associated with holding a second job. Finally, I evaluate whether academics with patents are more likely to leave tenure-track academia altogether in order to earn higher returns on their innovations. This study shows that the factors associated with patenting by US scientists are very similar across the academic and industry sectors. I also find that innovation, measured by patents granted and patents commercialized, are positively associated with academic entrepreneurship measured by having a second job. Similarly, patents commercialized are positively correlated with incorporated self-employment and patents granted are positively associated with employment in a new business in the industry sector. Patents granted are positively associated with leaving tenure track academia, however, publications have a negative effect on leaving the tenure track. After controlling for unobserved, individual heterogeneity, these relationships change. The commercialization of patents has a positive causal effect on academic entrepreneurship measured by having a second job, whereas patents granted have no significant effect. Patents granted also have a positive effect on employment in a small, entrepreneurial firm but have no causal effect on incorporated self-employment or new business employment in the industry sector. Patents commercialized have a weak, positive effect on leaving academia. Taken together, these results indicate that innovation does lead to entrepreneurship in both the academia and industry, however the relationship differs by sector. The paper proceeds as follows: Section two describes the data, section three details the estimation methods, section four discusses the empirical results and section five concludes."}, {"section_title": "II. Data and Methods", "text": "This study uses data from the 1995, 2001, and 2003 waves of the Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR). The SDR is a biennial, longitudinal survey of doctorate recipients from U.S. institutions conducted by the National Science Foundation. The SDR collects detailed information on U.S. science and social science doctorate recipients including demographic characteristics, educational background, employer characteristics, academic rank, government support, primary work activity, and salary. There are several advantages to using the SDR to examine the relationship between innovation and entrepreneurship. First, most studies of innovation have very limited information on the demographic characteristics, education, and employment background of the individual scientist. The SDR contains very detailed information on these characteristics and follows individuals over time. Second, the SDR contains information on the patenting process from start to commercialization, whereas a number of other studies rely on patents granted or case studies of the commercialization process. Third, the SDR is a representative sample of all scientists trained in the US. Thus, results from this study are not limited to a subset of scientists in one particular field. I limit my analysis to individuals in computer science and mathematics, physics, chemistry, life sciences, and engineering because these fields are most likely to generate patentable research. The data are divided into two sectors, those working full-time with non-missing information in four-year academic institutions and those working full-time with non-missing information in the industry sector. Respondents working in the government sector are dropped from the analysis. Individuals may appear in all three waves of the SDR in my sample. I create two samples from these data. First, I combine data from all years to investigate the correlations between innovation and entrepreneurship. This pooled data set will contain multiple observations for the same individual. Next, I create a longitudinal data set for individuals who appear more than once in the survey. The longitudinal data will be used to examine the causal relationship between innovation and entrepreneurship. In the 1995, 2001, and 2003 SDR, the survey asks respondents whether they have been named as an inventor on a patent application, the number of patent applications, the number of patents granted, and the number of granted patents commercialized in the previous five years. In addition the surveys ask the number of papers presented at conferences and papers accepted for publication in refereed journals in the previous five years. Publications, presentations, patent applications, patents granted, and patents commercialized will be used to measure innovation in both samples. Zucker, Darby et. al. show that academic \"stars\" in terms of publications are closely associated with new firms in the biotechnology and nanotechnology industries (Zucker, Darby, and Brewer 1998;Armstrong 1998, 2002;Darby and Zucker 2006;Zucker and Darby 2006c be realized. It is the commercialization of the patent through licensing or the creation of commercialized products that results in profits related to entrepreneurship. However, commercialization of patents may not be related to holding a second job if the commercialization involves licensing the invention. Thus, the paper will explore the relationship between commercialization and holding a second job as an academic. Table 1 presents mean characteristics of innovation and entrepreneurship in the academic sector. 3 The far right column in Table 1 shows the percentage of patents commercialized over total patents granted (for those that do patent). As expected, publications increase with academic rank. However, untenured associate and tenured full professors are the most likely to apply for and obtain patents. Scientists at Research I and academic medical centers have the highest rates of publication and patenting. Those who do patent, on-average commercialize approximately one-third of their discoveries. Although publication levels are lower at private universities on average, the number of patent applications is roughly similar to those found at Research I universities (however, the two categories do overlap). Interestingly, those who report having a second job in 1995 or 2001 also have higher publication rates, more patent applications, and the highest average commercialization rate relative to patents granted. Star publishers have more articles and more patent applications than those having a second job. This provides preliminary evidence that academic \"stars\" might be engaged in entrepreneurial activities. Life scientists and engineers are more likely to publish and patent than physical scientists, and the commercialization rate is highest among life scientists. Between 1995 and 2003 there has been a significant increase in the number of patent applications, patents granted, and patents commercialized. However, publications peaked in 2001 whereas patents increased through 2003. Table 2 shows similar descriptive statistics for the industry sector by employer size, entrepreneurial activity, field, and year. Academics are more likely to publish than non-academics whereas non-academics are more likely to apply for patents and commercialize patents once-granted. Star publishers in industry make over three times the patent applications as those in academia. Ironically, the percentage of patents commercialized is actually lower. Interesting patterns of patenting emerge by firm size. Employees at very small firms (less than 10 employees) are less likely to be engaged in patenting. However, employees at small firms (10-100 employees) are more likely to patent than medium sized firms. Employees at larger firms (with more than 1000 employees) also make relatively higher numbers of patent applications. For employees that patent at smaller firms (less than 25 employees) over half of all patents are commercialized. In terms of entrepreneurial activity, employees at new businesses or those who are incorporated self-employees make the most patent applications. Over half the patents held by the incorporated self-employed have been commercialized. Patent applications and grants are highest among physical scientists and engineers in the nonacademic sector. The commercialization rates are roughly similar across these fields. Similar to the academic sector, patent applications increased through 2003. Taken together the descriptive statistics in Tables 1 and 2 indicate a correlation between innovation and entrepreneurial activity. The next sections investigate these relationships in greater detail."}, {"section_title": "III. Estimation Methods", "text": "The analysis begins with an examination of the factors associated with patent applications, patent grants, and patent commercialization in the academic and industry sectors. Since these outcomes are counts truncated at zero, a negative binomial model is estimated where the patent outcome, y, is a function of observable characteristics X. I include variables typically found in human capital model estimates in X. Explanatory variables include demographics, PhD field, employer characteristics, and firm-specific human capital proxied by work activities on the primary job. In addition, X contains measures of publications which are highly correlated with patent outcomes and endogenous in the equation. In this first set of analyses, I ignore the endogeneity issues in order to focus on the correlations associated with patenting outcomes. Endogeneity will be addressed after these empirical associations are established. The second part of the analysis examines the correlation between innovation and entrepreneurship by estimating probit models of the effect of patenting (the measure of innovation) on entrepreneurial outcomes. Entrepreneurship is defined differently across the sectors. In the academic sector, entrepreneurship is defined as the probability of having a second job that is related to science and does not involve teaching. In the industry sector, I define entrepreneurship using three different measures: 1) incorporated self-employment; 4 2) employment in a small firm with less than 100 employees; and 3) employment in a business that is less than five years old. 5 Innovation may also be associated with exit from academic careers. I estimate the probability that tenure track academics have left academia permanently as a function of publication and patenting behavior. This allows me to evaluate whether innovation is linked with moving to the industry sector in order to facilitate the economic rewards of scientific discovery. This second set of analyses does not control for the potential endogeneity of patents in the entrepreneurship estimates. These first two sets of estimates pool data from all three years of the SDR. The third set of regressions uses panel data from the SDR and fixed-effects methods to examine the causal question: Does innovation lead to entrepreneurship? To the extent that patenting behavior is endogenous to the entrepreneurship decision, the probit estimates above will be biased. Consider the model of the effect of patenting on the probability of entrepreneurship. Let y it measure the entrepreneurship outcome, where i indexes individuals and t indexes time. Let X it be characteristics that vary across individuals and time, and P it be patent status. Consider the model: Conditional logit models estimate the probability of entrepreneurship in the academic and industry sectors and the probability of leaving tenure track academia as a function of patents, publications, and additional covariates."}, {"section_title": "IV. Empirical Results", "text": "The empirical analysis begins with a set of descriptive regressions that show the correlations between observable characteristics, innovation, entrepreneurship, and exiting academic careers. I focus initially on these descriptive results because few studies of innovation contain the detailed demographic, education, and career variables that are available in the SDR. The analysis then focuses on the causal relationship between innovation and entrepreneurship using fixed-effects methods to control for unobserved individual heterogeneity.

Innovation and Exit from Tenure Track Academia", "text": "Next, I examine whether innovation is associated with leaving tenure track academia in Table 7. The sample is limited to those who report ever holding a tenure track job, and I estimate the probability of leaving academia permanently. The first specification includes innovation measures, the second adds demographic and Ph.D. information, and the third adds work activities and state dummies. In all three specifications, patents granted are associated with a permanent exit from academia. However, publications and presentations are negatively associated with leaving the tenure track. I find no significant impact of star publications on any of these specifications. This indicates that successful publishers are more likely to remain in academia. Women "}, {"section_title": "D. Does Innovation Lead to Entrepreneurship?", "text": "Tables 8 through 10 use conditional logit methods to control for unobserved individual heterogeneity in order to examine whether changes in innovation lead to entrepreneurship or exit from academic careers. If the publication and patent decision is correlated with unobserved individual characteristics, then controlling for this individual fixed-effect will provide unbiased estimates of the effect of patents and publications on the entrepreneurship decision.  Table 5 patents granted and commercialized and presentations were positively correlated with having a second job in the academic sector. The results in Table 8 show that the commercialization of patents increases the likelihood of having a second job by 73 percent in column three. Once I control for publications and presentations, the coefficient on patent commercialization increases the likelihood of having a second job to 91 percent and is significant at the one percent level. Having obtained a patent is not significant in any of the specifications. These results suggest that patent applications and patent grants, measures widely used in the literature, may be poor proxies for academic entrepreneurship. The commercialization of patents clearly leads to academic entrepreneurship in the form of having a second job and supports the findings in Zucker, Darby et. al. These results indicate that individuals with commercialized patents are involved in employment outside of academia. Although I cannot link these individuals to specific firms, as the case studies of biotechnology and nano technology in Zucker, Darby et. al. do, I demonstrate that patent commercialization leads to academic entrepreneurship in all scientific fields. The main conduit of academic entrepreneurship is patent commercialization and applies to all scientific fields. This is especially true in computer science and for those working primarily with computers or other work activities. Table 9 presents the conditional logit estimates of the effect of patents and publications on industry entrepreneurship. Once I control for unobserved heterogeneity, patents, publications, and presentations have no significant effect on self-employment or working for a new business. However, obtaining a patent increases the likelihood that a person works for a small firm with less than 100 employees by around 5 percent. This patent effect is much smaller than that found in the academic sector. These results also differ significantly from the descriptive regression results presented in Table 6 where patents commercialized were positively associated with self-employment and patents granted were positively associated with working in a new business. Taken together, the results in Tables 8 and 9 suggest that patent commercialization has a causal effect on academic entrepreneurship, and obtaining a patent has a causal effect on working for a small firm. To the extent that small firm employment is a reasonable measure of entrepreneurship, the results suggest that innovation does have a causal effect on entrepreneurial activity in both the academic and industry sectors, however, the effects are much more pronounced for the academic sector."}, {"section_title": "E. Does Innovation Cause Exit from Tenure Track Academia?", "text": "Finally, I examine whether innovation has a causal effect on leaving academic careers in Table 10. I limit the sample to those individuals who have ever had a tenure track job and then estimate a conditional logit model of whether they take a nonacademic job at some point in the three surveys. As before, the star variable is included in the individual fixed effect. The results in Table 10 indicate that patents commercialized have a weak (p<.10) effect on exiting academia. Similar to the results in Table 8, working primarily with computers or other work activities have a strong, positive effect on leaving academia. Given the relatively weak effect of patents granted on exiting academic careers, the results suggest that innovation does not play as an important role in leaving academic careers."}, {"section_title": "V. Conclusions", "text": "This paper has examined whether innovation, measured by patents, leads to are more likely to patent than any other rank. In both sectors, scientists with doctorates in engineering and chemistry are the most likely to patent. In the industry sector, scientists employed at small firms are the most likely to make patent applications. In both sectors, publications and presentations are positively associated with patenting. However, being a star publisher-in the top 10 th percentile of publishing in the SDR-has no significant effect on patenting in either academic or industry sectors. I also find that innovation, measured by patents granted and patents commercialized, is positively associated with academic entrepreneurship measured by having a second job. Publications and being a star publisher have no significant effect on academic entrepreneurship. In the industry sector, patents commercialized are positively correlated with incorporated self-employment and patents granted are positively associated with employment in a new business in the industry sector. Publications have a negative effect on being self-employed or working for a small business while having no significant effect on working for a new business. However, star publishers are significantly more likely to be self-employed. Patents granted are positively associated with exiting the tenure track. However these descriptive regression estimates are likely biased by the endogeneity of the publication and patenting decision. I address this endogeneity using fixed-effects methods. After controlling for unobserved heterogeneity, the estimated relationship between innovation and entrepreneurship change significantly. In the academic sector, only the commercialization of patents has a large, positive effect on academic entrepreneurship measured by having a second job, whereas patents granted have no significant effect. Patents commercialized increase the likelihood of having a second job between 73 and 91 percent. In the industry sector, patents granted also have a positive effect on employment in a small, entrepreneurial firm but have no causal effect on incorporated selfemployment or new business employment. However, the effect is much smaller than that found in academia. Thus, patents do not lead to self-employment, one often-used measure of entrepreneurship, but they are linked to employment at small firms that are most likely engaged in entrepreneurial activity. Finally, I find very limited evidence that innovation causes academics to leave the tenure track. Why are the causal links between innovation and entrepreneurship stronger in the academy than industry? This may result from the ownership of the patent rights in academia. Typically, firms in industry hold the right to patents discovered by employees. Thus, an industry scientist is not free to take his patented research to other firms since his previous employer is the patent assignee. In academia, the scientist and university can share the property right to a patent or the scientist or the university can be the sole assignee. The property right of the patent depends on the negotiation between the university and the faculty member. 8 Given that the property rights of patents are less well-defined in academia, the commercialization of patents likely paves the way to entrepreneurial ventures by academic scientists. These results have implications for research on academic entrepreneurship. Many researchers use patents granted as a measure of academic entrepreneurship. As I argue in the introduction, patent applications and patents granted may be poor proxies for entrepreneurship in academia because many patents are not commercialized, and commercialization may take the form of licensing to well-established firms. This paper supports this argument, suggesting that patent applications and patent grants will overstate academic entrepreneurship relative to measures that focus on patent commercialization. The results in this paper support some of the conclusions of the case studies by Although, I do find that star publishers are more likely to be self-employed in the nonacademic sector, these stars are less likely to leave academic science for industry. Results from Tables 9 and 10 suggest that stars in particular, and those that publish in general, are less likely to leave academic science. It could be that having a second job, used to measure academic entrepreneurship, does not capture the involvement of stars as measured by Zucker, Darby et. al. Alternatively, Zucker, Darby, et. al.' Moreover, the definition of star in this study and Zucker, Darby et. al. differs-with my definition likely being more broadly defined. One of these explanations or a combination of them may explain the discrepancy of these results. Taken together, these results indicate that innovation does lead to entrepreneurship in both the academic and industry sectors. Baumol's \"plausible observation\" that innovators are associated with small business enterprises is borne out by the data, especially for the academic sector.
