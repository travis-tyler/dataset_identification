[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The purpose of this study is to increase the number of species occurrence data by integrating opportunistic data with Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) benchmark data via a novel optimization technique. The optimization method utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) and a simulated annealing (SA) algorithm to maximize the average likelihood of species occurrence in maximum entropy presence-only species distribution models (SDM). We applied the Kruskal-Wallis test to assess the differences between the corresponding environmental variables and habitat suitability indices (HSI) among datasets, including data from GBIF, Facebook (FB), and data from optimally selected FB data. To quantify uncertainty in SDM predictions, and to quantify the efficacy of the proposed optimization procedure, we used a bootstrapping approach to generate 1000 subsets from five different datasets: (1) GBIF; (2) FB; (3) GBIF plus FB; (4) GBIF plus optimally selected FB; and (5) GBIF plus randomly selected FB. We compared the performance of simulated species distributions based on each of the above subsets via the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC). We also performed correlation analysis between the average benchmark-based SDM outputs and the average dataset-based SDM outputs. Median AUCs of SDMs based on the dataset that combined benchmark GBIF data and optimally selected FB data were generally higher than the AUCs of other datasets, indicating the effectiveness of the optimization procedure. Our results suggest that the proposed approach increases the quality and quantity of data by effectively extracting opportunistic data from large unstructured datasets with respect to benchmark data."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Improving both the quality and quantity of species occurrence data is crucial for biological monitoring and species distribution modeling (SDM) in the investigation of biodiversity [1] [2] [3] [4] . Although professionally collected data are the preferred data source for SDM, they are expensive to collect and are often in short supply. Data collected using proper crowdsourcing techniques, often termed \"opportunistic data\" [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] or unstructured volunteer data, can provide ecologists with a variety of biodiversity monitoring data. Consequently, volunteer-based citizen science monitoring systems have attracted a lot of attention. However, even professionally curated databases, which include portals for citizen scientists and increase the amount of structured data available for research, lack adequate coverage of species occurrence. Fortunately, opportunistic data are increasing exponentially as technology that is useful in wildlife monitoring is becoming more widespread, such as mobile phone use and smart phone application software [1] . Volunteers can therefore contribute monitoring data to a variety of existing datasets. In the last decade, volunteer-based citizen science monitoring data (henceforth opportunistic data) have been collected by a number of platforms, e.g., eBird [13] , BeeID [14] , EpiCollect projects [15] and the EnjoyMoths project [3] . The opportunistic data collected through these platforms have also been taken advantage of by many biological conservation studies, including invasive species [16, 17] , habitat loss [6] , conservation prioritization [18] , wild species turnover [10] , and wolf colonization [11] studies.\nAlthough the proponents of opportunistic monitoring techniques are quick to point out the benefits of this type of data [3, 11] , the data often lack structure and contain a number of other limitations [19] [20] [21] that have been identified by critics. Since opportunistic data are usually collected by volunteers, most of whom lack formal survey training [22] , misidentification and biases such as overrepresentation of certain areas are more prevalent in these datasets [3, 23] , even though many of the opportunistic data may be reliable. Therefore, although opportunistic data may supplement professionally collected data, they are not a substitute for it. For example, Kamp et al. [24] demonstrated that opportunistic data might not fulfill one of the most critical functions of a structured monitoring program, i.e., the ability to identify population fluctuations. Spatial biases in opportunistic data can also be problematic when low quality species survey data lead to biased species distribution estimates, which may result in unsuitable biodiversity conservation policies [25] . Compared to models based on monitoring data collected by experts, models based on data collected by untrained citizen scientists can contain higher variability [3, 8, 23] . Such variability can arise from a number of sources, e.g., misidentification of species [3, 23] , and can result in under-or overestimates of species abundance [3, 8] . In addition, opportunistic data typically consists of species presence locations, without information on species absences [8, 26] . Munson et al. [27] also found that the eBird opportunistic data had more uncertainty than the professionally collected North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) data. Due to these and other issues, many still consider opportunistic data to be low quality and unreliable for research and conservation planning purposes [9] .\nAdvocates of opportunistic data, however, contend that there are a number of techniques for handling reliability issues, and that as long as researchers are aware of the key limitations and use the data appropriately, opportunistic data can supplement professionally collected data and potentially help bridge the gap between science and action [12, 28] . Furthermore, the sheer quantity and spatial extent of opportunistic data can provide researchers and policy makers with information on ecological trends that may otherwise go unnoticed due to the relative scarcity of professionally collected data [4, 10] . Studies demonstrating the similar predictive results of models built on opportunistic data versus professional data further justify the use of opportunistic data [27] . A study conducted by Bried and Siepielski [10] also indicated that their presence-only opportunistic datasets contained identical patterns to that of presence-absence systematic datasets.\nAlthough opportunistic data can provide a number of advantages, opportunistic data accuracy varies with monitoring task difficulty [29] . It is therefore essential to assess and maximize the analytical value of specific opportunistic data. Researchers have accomplished this using a number of techniques that balance data quantity with data quality [30] . Since it is often difficult for researchers to objectively assess the merits of data collected by anonymous volunteers, opportunistic data quality is often evaluated in terms of its similarity to professionally collected benchmark datasets [29, 31] . Furthermore, cross-validating opportunistic data quality using predicted species presence probabilities [32] enables assessment of record outlier veracity, subsequent flagging, and filtering of these records. Therefore, opportunistic data reliability is increased by direct or indirect data integration with professionally collected field survey data [4, 8] .\nIn recent years, a number of statistical and data filtering tools have been proposed which could be effective at removing biases while maintaining biological change signals [1] and addressing data quality issues such as measurement error, spatial clustering, detection, and identification [27] . Here we divide these approaches into two categories, including collection-oriented and species-oriented techniques. Collection-oriented techniques rely on data collection standards to validate opportunistic data, i.e., who uploaded the data and how were the data collected. One popular user-oriented technique that has spurred numerous related ecological sampling methodologies, considers the amount of filtered data extracted per species per specific site or visited location [9, 17, 24, 33] . Other examples of collection-oriented techniques are those that incorporate meta-data on the relative expertise of data collectors, e.g., Yu et al. [34] . Species-oriented techniques, on the other hand, rely on known species distributions to validate opportunistic data. There have been a number of methods used in species-oriented techniques. The most common approaches evaluate the veracity of given opportunistic data based on how similar they are to current expectations. These approaches vary from basic statistical approaches that identify outliers, probabilistic models, multi-component occupancy-detection models, hierarchical based data filtering methods, Multivariate Conditional Autoregressive (MVCAR) models, to machine learning approaches [1, 4, 24, 26, 30, 35] .\nIn this study, we focus on opportunistic data collected in Taiwan from the EnjoyMoths project's social media Facebook (FB) page [36] . Previously, Lin et al. [3] , applied NLP to extract the names of species and places from text in EnjoyMoths FB page posts. We combined this resultant FB data with professionally collected data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) using the proposed optimization procedure. This method extracts opportunistic data that correspond strongly with the environmental variables of professionally-collected data. We then statistically tested the differences between the corresponding environmental variables and the resultant SDM habitat suitability index (HSI) values from GBIF only data, FB only data, and GBIF plus optimally selected FB data. Next, we applied a bootstrapping method and four SDM types to validate our data extraction method. We then performed data uncertainty analysis on our five datasets: (1) GBIF only data; (2) FB only data; (3) GBIF plus FB data (GBIF + FB); (4) GBIF plus optimally selected FB data (GBIF + FB_o); and (5) GBIF plus randomly selected FB data (GBIF + FB_r). In addition, we performed correlation analysis between the SDM \"benchmark output\" averages and the SDM output averages. Benchmark outputs were based on the GBIF dataset whereas other outputs were based on the other datasets mentioned above. Based on our validation results, the proposed data filtering method is effective. The results indicate that this technique can extract complementary opportunistic data from existing datasets, thereby providing a more in-depth understanding of the status and trends of biodiversity."}, {"section_title": "Methods and Material", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study Area and Focal Species", "text": "Taiwan is a subtropical island with an area of 36,000 km 2 .

We applied environmental descriptor variables to create a bio-climatic map for assessing the representation of bio-climate zones against an independent bio-climatic map of Metzger et al. [38] .

Although opportunistic data integrity may be compromised by a general lack of important metadata, e.g., sampling effort [4, 11] , suitable techniques in conjunction with reasonable assumptions can garner quality data [3, 4, 29] . While many opportunistic data extraction techniques have been developed and used in biological studies [3, 4, 10, 17, 33] , few have considered professionally collected data based SDM outputs [32] . One recent trend uses integrated modeling techniques to utilize, or \"share\", information from disparate data sources in SDMs [44] rather than strictly extracting opportunistic data. Another, more recent joint modeling method presented by Pacifici et al. [4] , uses data from structured and unstructured surveys to directly inform SDMs by sharing parameters in jointly estimated likelihoods. Some approaches have even considered other criteria such as the relative competence of volunteers who upload opportunistic data [34, 35] . Despite the wide range of available approaches, maximizing likelihood is the most common approach to obtain presence-only data [26] . This study used an SA approach to maximize the average likelihood of a maximum entropy presence-only species distribution model based on NLP extracted opportunistic data collected by citizen scientists and successfully identified reliable inputs with respect to the designated benchmark GBIF dataset.\nMore specifically, in contrast to other studies [3, 4, 10, 11] , this study proposes and validates an optimal data filtering method using SA techniques to extract samples from opportunistic data by removing unrealistic entries as identified by GBIF based SDMs. While the validation results suggest that the proposed optimal filtering method successfully selected high quality data from the opportunistic data by maximizing the likelihood function in the study cases, there are a number of caveats. For example, a basic premise of this optimization technique is that the benchmark data is relatively free of data biases, i.e., in this case the professionally collected GBIF data is free of specimen misidentification, spatial over-or underrepresentation, etc. In addition, there are a number of parameters and settings that can affect the performance and efficiency of SA. In this study, we used an exponential cooling schedule at three cooling rates, all of which Robini and Reissman [45] reported as the most successful. Theoretically, the series of iterations converge to a global optimum while the cooling rates tend to zero. In this study, by using the proposed filtering method at the 0.5 cooling rate, the average species presence probability increased by 2.2 to 10 times. Despite this, the optimal selected sample size at the 0.5 cooling rate is less than the sample sizes identified at the 0.3 and 0.4 cooling rates. The 0.5 cooling rate also produced the highest average rate of increase in the maximum likelihood value."}, {"section_title": "Uncertainty Analysis", "text": "As seen in the variation explained by the first PCA component of species HSI [42, 43] , uncertainty analysis revealed low uncertainty in the HSI derived from the professionally collected GBIF data plus opportunistic data from optimally selected FB dataset (GBIF + FB_o) relative to the GBIF plus opportunistic data from randomly selected FB dataset (GBIF + FB_r). Interestingly, the GBIF plus all opportunistic data from Facebook (GBIF + FB) yielded the lowest uncertainty. Given the inverse relationship between uncertainty and sample size, this could be attributable to the greater number of samples from the GBIF+FB dataset used to train the SDMs. As Buisson et al. [46] noted, assessing the uncertainty that data collection introduces into species distribution predictions is crucial, as is comparing the effects of varying dataset sizes [47] ."}, {"section_title": "Method Validation", "text": "Recently, numerous studies successfully used opportunistic data with various datasets in their biological mapping and species modeling [3, 4, 10, 11, 28] . In this study, we used three main validation criteria: (1) the strength of the relationship between datasets and environmental variables; (2) resultant SDM performance; and (3) uncertainty analysis. By using the proposed method to combine professionally collected GBIF data and opportunistic datasets, we obtained larger datasets that resulted in higher performing species distribution estimates with lower uncertainty than those estimates based solely on GBIF. In addition, although the GBIF + FB_o dataset contained more uncertainty than the GBIF + FB dataset, the GBIF + FB_o dataset better reflected species preferences. Our results suggest that the proposed approach improves biodiversity monitoring program data by identifying high-quality citizen science data.\nOur results also clearly indicate that the proposed technique increases the number of available data by a factor of up to 2.47 times that of the original professionally collected GBIF dataset at a 0.5 cooling rate. Our approach can be used as a viable tool when combining multiple datasets of varying quality, i.e., a known high quality dataset combined with unknown quality datasets. Furthermore, our approach may be particularly useful when used in conjunction with other data integration modeling frameworks, such as that of Pacifici et al. [4] , which used integrated data to handle data contamination issues. For example, the Pacifici et al. [4] correlation modeling method may enhance the randomly selected opportunistic data models in this study since the correlation model has the ability to utilize information from disparate datasets and models when parameters between various datasets cannot be shared directly, e.g., differing measurement scales or drastic differences in data quality. On the other hand, the optimally selected opportunistic data technique presented here may improve the presence only Pacifici et al. [4] shared model when the reliability of opportunistic datasets have been verified, i.e., the spatial structures and species specific environmental variables match the high-quality datasets to a high degree.\nContrary to results obtained by using NPL-extracted FB data alone [3] , the optimally selected GBIF + FB_o dataset from this study tend to be located in areas that have higher GBIF-based SDM HSI. For some species, important predictive environmental variables found in GBIF and FB_o datasets exhibit more similarity with one another than with the FB datasets. For instance, for Asota egens indica, Biston perclarus, Chrysaeglia magnifica, Histia flabellicornis ultima, and Spodoptera litura, the average predictive strengths of the forest cover variable in FB_o datasets are significantly higher than those found in FB datasets. This is presumably due to the positive effects of forest cover on habitats. In contrast, FB_o datasets are less correlated with the distinct watershed area variable than the FB datasets, suggesting less bias associated with easily accessible or frequently visited recreational areas. These results indicate that suitable environmental variables should play a role in the extraction of reliable opportunistic data [10] . Our method demonstrates this when considering the SDM-identified environmental drivers during screening for potentially reliable samples.\nSDMs based on the GBIF + FB_o dataset outperformed other datasets in most cases, and reflect two benefits of using the proposed data filtering technique. First, the proposed optimal data filtering technique, in most cases, i.e., species and SDM model type combinations, may enable the selection of more biologically meaningful samples as indicated by a higher performing SDM than SDMs based on GBIF + FB_r. Second, higher performing models may also be a result of larger datasets. In this study, SDMs based on GBIF + FB_o performed better than GBIF-based SDMs. That is, the results indicate that the proposed approach increases SDM sample size and performance, and decreases model uncertainty. However, similar to the results of Munson et al. [27] , the GBIF only dataset-based SDM performance and the GBIF + FB_r dataset-based SDM performance had similar predictive powers in some cases. In addition to this, the GBIF-based SDM output correlation analysis revealed a high correlation with both GBIF + FB_o and GBIF + FB_r dataset-based SDM outputs. Nonetheless, the differences in spatial structure identified in the Kruskal-Wallis analysis stage of our study, as well as differences in the distribution of the AUC box-plotted analysis suggest that a data-extracting procedure is advisable. The AUC values clearly indicate lower median AUC values and higher AUC variability of models based on opportunistic data only versus models based on professionally collected data. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is also apparent when iteration durations are increased, and when the similarities between GBIF based and FB_o based model outputs are compared. The three main validation criteria used in this study: the strength of the relationship between datasets and environmental variables, resultant SDM performance, and uncertainty analysis, further support the appropriateness of the proposed filtering method in identifying high quality data. The disadvantages of non-filtered opportunistic data have also been demonstrated and include: apparent spatial biases for uninformative environmental variables; inclusion of unrealistic observational data with exceedingly low HSI values; lower SDM performance when compared to GBIF + FB_o based SDMs; and finally, higher SDM uncertainty when compared to equal sized filtered datasets. If professionally collected benchmark data are relatively unbiased, and are representative of the species of concern, the proposed technique can fill gaps in professionally collected datasets. Users should be cautious since the converse is also true, namely, if any biases exist in the benchmark dataset the proposed technique may only serve to amplify them. Despite this, the proposed optimal filtering technique has the potential to make meaningful contributions in biological conservation and policymaking since it analyzes large datasets of citizen science, validates entries, and identifies unbiased records that improve SDM predictions [3] ."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Opportunistic data can provide ecologists with additional samples to compensate for data gaps that may exist in the relatively small number of professionally collected, high-quality structured samples available from other sources. Our approach efficiently selected high quality, opportunistically sourced data using the proposed optimization technique with an automated NLP component, and combined this data with professionally collected GBIF data for modeling moth distributions. We used the Kruskal-Wallis test to analyze the properties of different datasets and the statistical differences between environmental variables and HSI values corresponding to benchmark data, opportunistic data, and filtered datasets. We also addressed the performance and uncertainty in SDM outputs based on different datasets by using a bootstrapping approach to generate random SDM data subsets. Our proposed data filtering method is a tool for filling current data gaps and improving biodiversity monitoring or biological conservation initiatives. By referencing reliable benchmark data, the proposed data extraction technique can garner valuable data from large unstructured datasets, thereby improving ecological data quality and quantity. "}]
