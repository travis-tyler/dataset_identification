Methods GeNFI participants were either carriers of a pathogenic mutation in progranulin, chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 or microtubule-associated protein tau or were at risk of carrying a mutation because a first-degree relative was a known symptomatic mutation carrier. exosomes were isolated from csF of 23 presymptomatic and 15 symptomatic mutation carriers and 11 healthy non-mutation carriers. expression of 752 miRNas was measured using quantitative pcR (qpcR) arrays and validated by qpcR using individual primers. MiRNas found differentially expressed in symptomatic compared with presymptomatic mutation carriers were further evaluated in a cohort of 17 patients with sporadic FTD, 13 patients with sporadic alzheimer's disease (aD) and 10 healthy controls (hcs) of similar age. results In the GeNFI cohort, miR-204-5p and miR-632 were significantly decreased in symptomatic compared with presymptomatic mutation carriers. Decrease of miR-204-5p and miR-632 revealed receiver operator characteristics with an area of 0.89 (90% cI 0.79 to 0.98) and 0.81 (90% cI 0.68 to 0.93), respectively, and when combined an area of 0.93 (90% cI 0.87 to 0.99). In sporadic FTD, only miR-632 was significantly decreased compared with aD and hcs. Decrease of miR-632 revealed an area of 0.90 (90% cI 0.81 to 0.98).

The pathogenic mechanisms resulting in FTD remain largely unknown, but current knowledge suggests that genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors contribute to disease development. 2 Approximately 40% of patients with FTD have a positive family history of dementia 3 and about 25% of patients with FTD have an identified genetic form of the disease. 1 The vast majority of genetic FTD is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern caused by mutations in one of three genes: chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9orf72), progranulin (GRN) or microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT). These genes provide an opportunity to study the disease in its presymptomatic phase and offer great hope for elucidating the pathogenic mechanisms that cause FTD. There is some mounting evidence that alterations in microRNA (miRNAs) may occur in FTD. [4] [5] [6] MiRNAs are small, non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression through post-transcriptional silencing of target mRNAs. 7 The same miRNA may regulate hundreds of target mRNAs affecting complex disease pathways. 8 MiRNAs are stable in body fluids and can be enriched in extracellular vesicles termed exosomes. These vesicles were thought to be a means for cells to discard unnecessary molecules into the extracellular space, 9 but more recent studies have shown that cells can transfer proteins, lipids, DNA, RNA and miRNA to other cells via exosomes. 10 Exosomes display different miRNA profiles compared with serum and cells, suggesting that a specific selection of exosomal miRNAs provides signals to regulate pathways in recipient cells. 11 This intercellular transfer can influence a multitude of biological processes relevant to the nervous system such as neuronal survival, neurite outgrowth and synaptic plasticity. [12] [13] [14] [15] Disease-relevant miRNAs may be enriched within exosomes, 16 and since miRNA expression can vary in different disease states, exosomal miRNAs are attractive targets for biomarker profiling. 17 18 Genetic FTD is a rare condition, and single groups have only been able to study small numbers of patients. Through the Genetic Frontotemporal Dementia Initiative (GENFI), we obtained CSF from individuals who were either symptomatic or presymptomatic carriers of a known pathogenic mutation in GRN, MAPT or C9orf72 or who were non-affected first-degree relatives of a known symptomatic carrier (healthy non-mutation carriers).

We found significantly lower expression of miR-204-5p and miR-632 in symptomatic compared with presymptomatic mutation carriers in the genetic FTD cohort. While the C9orf72 group followed this trend, most data supporting our conclusions come from symptomatic GRN mutation carriers and individuals diagnosed with bvFTD. In the sporadic disease cohort, miR-204-5p expression was not significantly different in FTD compared with AD and HCs, suggesting that genetic factors influence miR-204-5p expression. However, miR-632 was significantly decreased in sporadic FTD, underlining its potential as a diagnostic biomarker candidate for both genetic and sporadic FTD. ROC discriminated well between FTD and non-FTD (HC and AD). We appreciate that the frequency distribution of FTD, AD and HCs in our sample was not necessarily representative and that the true sensitivity and specificity of the test may be lower in a typical clinical setting.\nUsing in silico analysis, we found HRK to be a potential target of both miR-204-5p and miR-632 in the human frontal and temporal lobes. HRK encodes for the apoptosis activator, HARAKIRI. 29 Since the main function of miRNAs is silencing of mRNA, low miR-204-5p and miR-632 could result in pathologically increased HRK and apoptosis leading to degenerative changes within the frontal and temporal lobes of FTD patients. Wnt signalling has been implicated in FTD with GRN mutations, 30 31 and targeting the Wnt signalling pathway may emerge as a future therapeutic. 36 In addition to apoptosis and Wnt signalling, mRNA targets were found in other biological pathways that have been linked with neurodegeneration and/or FTD such as MAPK signalling, 37 endocytosis, 38 39 notch signalling 40 and neurotrophin signalling. 41 42 In summary, we showed exosomal miR-204-5p and miR-632 to have potential as diagnostic biomarkers for genetic FTD and miR-632 also for sporadic FTD. Through in silico target prediction and disease pathway analysis, we found some of these miRNAs to target mRNAs involved in pathways previously linked to FTD. To our knowledge, none of the miRNAs we found significantly altered in CSF exosomes have previously been reported in FTD or been implicated in its pathology. 5 Since miRNAs are still in their infancy, this is not unexpected. We must consider some limitations of the current study. We appreciate that sex was not matched in all groups. For example, while presymptomatic and symptomatic GRN groups contained equal numbers of females and males in the respective groups, all symptomatic C9orf72 mutation carriers were male, which may have introduced bias. Furthermore, most presymptomatic and symptomatic mutation carriers tested positive for a mutation in GRN, so our results will have to be confirmed in larger cohorts including more patients with C9orf72 and MAPT mutations. Ideally, our results will be confirmed in prospective studies including cohorts of genetic and sporadic FTD before the miRNA expression changes described here would be used in clinical practice. For the time being, our findings highlight that exosomal miRNAs have potential as diagnostic biomarkers for genetic and sporadic FTD."}]
