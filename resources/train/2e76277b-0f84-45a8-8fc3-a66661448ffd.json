AD is characterized by rapid forgetting, disorientation in time, and wayfinding difficulties severe enough to impair day to day activities. While the cause and mechanism of AD are still not well understood, it is commonly believed that the pathophysiologic process of AD takes place years or even decades before clinical symptoms develop. Individuals with amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) condition have been shown to have a high likelihood of progression to AD, with an annual conversion rate of 5 \u2212 10% [2] .\nAs no evidence yet suggests that the pathophysiologic progression in AD can be reversed, it is of great importance to make accurate diagnosis and initiate treatments at the earliest stages of AD, including MCI and presymptomatic states.\nIdentification and validation of biological markers (biomarkers) for AD/MCI are crucial in this pursuit. \u03b2-amyloid, total tau and phospho-tau-181 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are three well-accepted CSF biomarkers of neurodegeneration helpful for AD diagnosis. Neurodegeneration biomarkers, such as atrophy in hippocampi, can also predict further cognitive declines in MCI [3] ."}, {"section_title": "Neuroimaging modalities, including Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and", "text": "Positron Emission Tomography (PET), provide non-invasive approaches to measure the accepted biomarkers, as well as search for new biomarkers in CSF and brain structures.\nThe Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) [4] has provided a wealth of new data including structural and functional MR images to support the research on intervention, prevention and treatments of AD. Significant research efforts have been conducted using ADNI data to identify neuroimage biomarkers for the diagnoses of AD/MCI and various mixed pathologies. Machine learning techniques are widely employed, and there is a pressing need to refine the solutions of feature extraction, transformation and fusion to achieve more accurate patient classification.\nMetric functions are a pivotal component of distance-based machine learning solutions, e.g., k-NN and k-means. Many pattern classification algorithms rely on the Euclidean metric to compute pairwise dissimilarities, which assigns an equal weight to each feature component. Replacing the Euclidean with a metric learned from the inputs can often improve the algorithm's performance significantly [5, 6] . Learning such a metric is equivalent to learning a feature transformation [5] . Depending on the transformation to be sought, metric learning (ML) can be divided into linear and nonlinear groups [6] . Linear models [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] commonly attempt to estimate a \"best\" affine transformation to deform the feature space, such that the resulted pairwise Mahalanobis distances would well agree with the supervisory information brought by training samples. While easy to use and convenient to optimize, linear models possess limited expressive power and separation capability in handling data with nonlinear structures. Nonlinear models [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20] are usually designed through kernelization or localization of certain linear models. The idea of localization is to build an overall nonlinear metric through combination of multiple piecewise linear metrics that are learned based on either local neighborhoods or class memberships. Although the multi-metric strategies are commonly more powerful in accommodating nonlinear structures, generalizing these methods to fit other classifiers than k-NN is not trivial. To avoid nonsymmetric metrics, extra cares are often needed to ensure the smoothness of the transformed feature space.\nFeature extraction and fusion from the ADNI database is also in great need of further exploration. In neuroimaging applications, features are commonly sought at three levels: voxel, patch and regions of interest (ROI). For structural features extracted from brain MRIs, cortical thickness [21] , volumetry of brain structures [22, 23] and voxel tissue probability maps [24, 25] across the whole brain or around certain ROIs, are among the popular choices. Patch-based solutions [25, 26, 27] , first dividing the original image into small-sized patches and then extracting their feature vectors, have gained great popularity in recent years. Patch extraction is relatively easy to carry out, as it does not require ROI identification or image segmentation. Comparing with voxel features, patch features can still very well capture subtle brain changes, but with greatly reduced dimensionalities. While impressive classification results have been reported, most studies use either cross-sectional features obtained at one point in time [28, 29, 25, 27, 30, 31, 32] , or \"static\" longitudinal volumetric information acquired at two or multiple time points but only through structural segmentation [33, 34, 35] . In part due to the unavailability of deformation data in ADNI, \"dynamic\" longitudinal information such as the atrophies at various gray matter (GM) areas, which is a major hallmark in the progression of AD, has not been fully utilized in the literature.\nDeep learning models, which have recently revolutionized many domains of artificial intelligence (AI) including image search and speech recognition, may provide a set of successful methods to enhance fusion of multi-modality neuroimaging data, allowing improved clinical reliability in AD/MCI diagnoses [36, 25] . The main promise of deep learning is replacing handcrafted features with multiple levels of representations of the data, obtained via (unsupervised) learning. These representations, each corresponding to a level of abstraction, form a hierarchy of concepts. Inspired by these significant developments in AI, we exploit deep neural networks in our study to build a feature fusion architecture to incorporate cross-sectional and longitudinal information."}, {"section_title": "Contributions and paper overview", "text": "In this paper, we propose to improve the quality of AD/MCI neuroimage biomarker identification along two directions: 1) feature space transformation through a novel nonlinear metric learning (ML) technique, and 2) extraction and integration of dynamic longitudinal atrophy features into the classification framework.

Typically, metric learning algorithms are utilized as a preprocessing step, followed by the application of the learned metric or transformation to the ensuing classification or clustering algorithms. However, it has been empirically demonstrated in [37] that such \"feature-transform-then-classification\" strategy does not always improve the performance of the ensuing classifiers, especially those that are non-NN based. In recent years, ML has been applied to SVM models [37, 38] . To date, however, the existing SVM-based ML models employ only linear transformations, limiting their capabilities in dealing with complex data.\nThe nonlinear feature transformation solution proposed in this study is a direct generalization of linear metric learning through the application of deformable geometric models to transform the entire feature space. We choose the thin-plate splines (TPS) as the transformation model, as TPS are well-known for their remarkable versatility and representation power in accounting for highorder deformations. The nonlinear feature transformation and the SVM classifier are simultaneously optimized through an efficient EM-like (expectationmaximization) algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that utilizes nonlinear dense transformations, or spatially varying deformation models in metric learning, with a specific design for SVMs. In the coming paragraphs, we will describe the theoretical background of the TPS under the general context of geometric transformations, then present our proposed TPS Metric Learning for Support Vector Machines (TML-SVM) model."}, {"section_title": "TPS transformation", "text": "When utilized to align a set of n corresponding point-pairs u i and v i , (i = 1, . . . , n), a TPS transformation is a mapping function f (x) :\nsuitable Hilbert space H, that simultaneously matches u i and v i and minimizes the following TPS smoothness penalty functional:\nwhere D m f is the matrix of m-th 1 order partial derivatives of f (\u00b7), with a k \nwhere f k is the kth vector component of f (\u00b7), ||.|| denotes the Euclidean norm and {\u03c8 i } (i = 1, 2, ..., n) are a set of weights for the nonlinear part. and c are the weights for the linear part.

In this study, we adopt a similar patch extraction strategy as in [27] to extract two types of patches from the MP-RAGE scans: GM and DM patches. GM patches contain candidate areas where two groups (e.g., AD vs. NC) differ greatly in terms of gray matter densities. DM patches capture the areas where group atrophy patterns are significantly different.\nTo facilitate the ensuing patch-level operations, the T1-weighted MRIs (at both M0 and M12) were first normalized onto an International Consortium for Brain Mapping template through Statistical Parametric Mapping [45] were identified as the seeds for patch extraction. The mean p-values in the seed voxels' enclosing patches of size 5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 5 were then used to sort the patch seeds.\nBased on their ascending order, we selected the first 100 class-discriminative patches in a greedy manner with the condition that no candidate patch pair should have more than 50% overlapping volume.

Deep neural networks have been utilized in several recent AD/MCI works [23, 30, 27, 49] , with the same goal of learning a latent and compressed representation of the input feature vectors.\nStacked auto-encoder [23, 30] , restricted Boltzmann machine [27] and convolu-tional networks [49] are among the choices that have been examined. In this paper, we adopt a different model -stacked denoising sparse auto-encoder (stacked DSAE), which is a combination of denoising and sparse auto-encoders [50, 51] . The \"GM/DM/Aseg\" features go through stacked DSAE separately, then we utilize another fusion layer on top to further combine the separate outputs. Our approach is different from some recent methods [23, 30] : not only does it maximize the mutual information from different sources, it also enables users to control the size of the fused features, desirable for the goal of dimension reduction."}, {"section_title": "Stacked denoising sparse auto-encoder (Stacked-DSAE)", "text": "The goal of an auto-encoder (AE) is to learn a latent representation for the input vector x through estimating a nonlinear approximation function h W,b (x) \u2248\nx.

Sparse autoencoder learns sparse over-complete representation by ensuring the majority of the hidden nodes \"inactive\" most of the time. This can be done by adding a sparse penalty into the objective function. Denoising auto-encoder, on the other hand, obtains a more robust representation by cleaning partially corrupted input (denoising). In this work, we combine these two models to construct a denoising sparse auto-encoder (DSAE), and use it as the solution for feature extraction.\nThis choice is based on the nature of the \"GM/DM\" features. While easy to obtain, the \"GM/DM\" feature vectors contain many non-discriminative components. DSAE is designed under the hypothesis that it can learn a compressed representation from the rather noisy input.\nTo build a deep network, we stack multiple DSAEs, wiring the outputs of each hidden layer to the inputs of the successive layer, to form a stacked DSAE.\nSuch multi-layer networks can be pretrained level by level in a greedy fashion.\nCompared with single layer shallow networks, stacked deep networks are more effective in finding highly nonlinear and complex patterns in data [51] . In this work, we use three separate stacked DSAEs, for \"GM\", \"DM\", and \"Aseg\" features respectively, to extract their latent representations.

Some very recent works [27, 30] reported rather high accuracies through the applications of multi-modality information integration (mainly MRIs and PETs) and sophisticated multi-classifier decision fusion schemes. Analysis of the solutions striving to address the same problem is crucial to advance the developments of highly effective methods.\nHowever, direct comparisons of the published neuroimaging algorithms are often not feasible, unless common subjects, datasets and modalities are employed, as in the evaluation project conducted by Cuingnet et al. [28] . When different datasets and experimental setups are utilized, which is common for many neuroimage studies, higher accuracy or better results over a competing solution ought to be interpreted as indirect evidence of the model efficacy, rather than the proof of superiority for head-to-head competitions.\nWe conduct the first set of comparisons with the solutions that are very close to our model in nature. Four recently published works are chosen: 1)\nvoxel-wise GM densities based method by Kloppel et al. [21] which obtained the best performance among the ten methods evaluated in [28] ; 2) 93-region GM densities method by Zhang et al. [29] , 3) the single classifier results using patch-wise GM, as presented in Liu et al. [25] , and 4) a longitudinal work by\nMcEvoy et al. [34] , which uses the quadratic discriminant analyses (QDAs) as the classifier with ROI features extracted from the baseline and one-year followup information. Unlike the \"DM\" features in our work, the subtraction-based atrophy calculation in [34] is not dynamic. Similar to our method, these four solutions all use MR images as the sole information source and rely on single classifiers for classification. The comparison results are shown in Table 6 . From Table 6 , we make the following observations. Our proposed model performs better than the competing methods in terms of classification accuracy in AD vs. NC classification, and accuracy and sensitivity in MCI vs. NC classification. Although the results for specificity reported in [28] are slightly higher than ours, it is at the expense of sacrificing sensitivity, leading to a worse accuracy. Researchers in [34] reported the highest sensitivity for AD vs.\nNC classification, but their accuracy and specificity are relatively lower than those produced in our method. In addition, compared to those three methods [28, 29, 25] Table 6 is outperformed by our model, but their multi-SVM version, through sophisticated multi-classifier decision fusion schemes, produces significantly improved results. Liu et al. [31, 32] use multiple templates and combine the outputs from multiple SVMs to achieve impressively high accuracies. Li et al.\n[33] use multi-year longitudinal information, including scans from 36-month visits, in their solution. As AD patients' late scans are commonly more revealing than those at baseline, very accurate diagnosis (96.1%) becomes possible.\nWhile our model is single-classifier based, it achieves comparable performance with some of the aforementioned multi-classifier solutions. Upgrading our TPS-SVM with multi-kernel or multiple SVMs, or applying metric learning to the solutions in Table 7 , could both potentially lead to performance improvements for the respective models. Structure MRIs are the sole information source of our current solution, therefore it can be expected that the performance of our model can be further improved if additional modalities, e.g., PET, functional MRI or diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), are integrated as inputs. All in all, we believe our pipeline achieves rather high accuracy in AD/MCI vs. NC classification with simple setups and limited information sources (structural MRIs alone), and lays a solid foundation for further integration and generalization.
