A possible mechanism may be via ischemic infarction-driving amyloid deposition. We conducted a study to determine the presence of \u03b2-amyloid in infarct, peri-infarct, and hemispheric areas after stroke. We hypothesized that an infarct would trigger \u03b2-amyloid deposition, with deposition over time. Methods-Patients were recruited within 40 days of acute ischemic stroke and imaged with computed tomographic or magnetic resonance imaging and Pittsburgh compound B (11C-PiB) positron emission tomographic scans. Follow-up positron emission tomographic scanning was performed in a subgroup \u226418 months after the stroke event. Standardized uptake value ratios for regions of interest were analyzed after coregistration. Results-Forty-seven patients were imaged with 11 C-PiB positron emission tomography. There was an increase in 11 C-PiB accumulation in the stroke area compared with a reference region in the contralesional hemisphere, which was not statistically significant (median difference in standardized uptake value ratio, 0.07 [95% confidence interval, \u22120.06 to 0.123]; P=0.452). There was no significant increase in the accumulation of 11 C-PiB in the peri-infarct region or in the ipsilesional hemisphere (median difference in standardized uptake value ratio, 0.04 [95% confidence interval, \u22120.02 to 0.10]; P=0.095). We repeated 11 C-PiB positron emission tomography in 21 patients and found a significant reduction in accumulation of 11 C-PiB between regions of interest (median difference in standardized uptake value ratio, \u22120.08 [95% confidence interval, \u22120.23 to \u22120.03]; P=0.04). Conclusions-There was no significant increase in 11 C-PiB accumulation in or around the infarct. There was no increase in ipsilesional hemispheric 11 C-PiB accumulation over time.

What triggers A\u03b2 deposition is unknown, but it is hypothesized that hypoxia and ischemia may play a role. The association between acute ischemia or hypoxia and cerebral A\u03b2 deposition has been largely based on animal studies, whereas human studies have been mostly negative. 9 , 10 Lee et al 11 reported an increase in serum A\u03b2 in patients with acute stroke compared with stroke-free controls. Imaging studies by Marchant et al 12 showed no correlation between the burden of cerebral vascular lesions and the degree of 11 C-PiB accumulation.\nThe link between vascular risk factors, acute vascular events, and A\u03b2 formation is the subject of much debate, 13, 14 but it is now generally accepted that vascular risk factors, such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus, independently increase the risk of developing AD. 15 It has been suggested that a synergistic relationship may exist between the presence of vascular risk factors/stroke and the development of AD. 16 The recent and ongoing research by the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) also suggests that a relationship may exist between vascular risk factors and the development of AD. 17 However, there is no research to date that has been able to demonstrate a causative link between vascular risk factors and acute vascular lesions in the brain and formation of A\u03b2. 18 We hypothesized that an acute ischemic stroke would trigger the formation and deposition of A\u03b2 in the infarct and peri-infarct areas. In view of the recent literature on vascular risk factors, stroke, and AD, 19 we further hypothesized that accumulation of A\u03b2 would increase over time, with higher global A\u03b2 load both in the ipsilesional cerebral hemisphere and throughout the brain.

The neocortical SUVR was then calculated using all the original ROIs and then recalculated excluding ROIs that overlapped an infarct region.

We analyzed the stroke-specific SUVR of the infarct and peri-infarct areas to study 11 C-PiB retention over time using the same template for infarct and peri-infarct areas.

We hypothesized that acute ischemia would trigger A\u03b2 formation and deposition in the infarct area, including the ipsilateral cerebral hemisphere. In addition, we theorized that the increased A\u03b2 deposition would continue over time. In our previous article, we presented preliminary results that seemed to support this hypothesis in a group of patients with ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic transformation. 22 We found an increased accumulation of 11 C-PiB in the infarct core but no increased accumulation of 11 C-PiB in the ipsilateral cerebral hemisphere. In addition to the standard SUVR used in the previous study, we included manually drawn ROIs to include specific infarct and peri-infarct areas. The same approach was applied to the follow-up studies.\nOur results show that there was no significant increase of PiB accumulation in the infarct and peri-infarct areas compared with their mirror regions in the contralateral hemisphere. This differs from our initial findings. 20 There are many possible reasons for this difference. In this study, we assessed a larger number of participants and applied a more accurate An SUVR >1.4 was considered significant. SUVR of the ipsilesional and contralesional hemisphere is also shown. In the follow-up study, 21 patients were rescanned. The value analyzed was the difference in change of the SUVR for the previously described regions of interest between the first and second scans. SUVR indicates standardized uptake value ratio. There is an area of hypointensity on gradient echo (GRE) seen in the left temporoparietal region (2a) that corresponds to the region of contrast enhancement within the infarct indicated by the white arrow on T1-weighted imaging (2b). The contrast enhancement suggests increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier, and the hypointense areas on GRE indicate microbleeds. The higher accumulation of PiB is represented by the yellow and red areas in the left temporoparietal region (2c) where the ischemic infarct occurred. There is no tracer retention seen in the contralateral mirror region or in other parts of the brain. The infarct-specific standardized uptake value ratios in this case was \u22481.9. The overlap (2d) of the positron emission tomographic and T1-weighted images shows the exact match of the area of increased vascularity and PiB accumulation. determination of SUVR. We also obtained follow-up imaging in a subgroup of patients, allowing direct comparison of findings in individual patients over time. We corrected for potential bias in the event of coincidental overlap of the infarct area and neocortical regions used in determining the overall SUVR in each hemisphere.\nWe previously reported a significant increase in SUVR in the infarct region, which was not reflected in a general increase in SUVR globally. 20 We found that 16 of the 47 patients showed a significant accumulation of 11 C-PiB in the stroke region (Figure 2 ). When the images were closely analyzed, we found that 81% of patients with a higher infarct SUVR had variable amounts of hemorrhagic transformation. The large number of patients with hemorrhagic transformation in our group is likely due to the fact that assessment was mostly based on gradient echo images. These are more sensitive to the presence of blood products. In addition, we made no distinction between the degree or type of hemorrhagic transformation.\nThe role of vascular pathology in patients with suspected dementia is complex, and there are no clear answers yet on the likely role of vascular risk factors in the development of AD-related pathology. We assessed the effect of vascular disease on 11 C-PiB retention and found no association between the presence of significant carotid disease (based on carotid Doppler) and A\u03b2 deposition based on neocortical SUVR. Our findings are in contrast to a previous study that demonstrated a significant association between carotid stenosis and ipsilateral A\u03b2 deposition based on PET imaging. 26 We have demonstrated no association in a larger cohort of patients, and we would also argue that concordance between laterality of carotid stenosis and A\u03b2 deposition on PET should not be associated given the collateral cerebral arterial network. However, the primary aim of our study was not to examine the relationship between carotid stenosis and A\u03b2 deposition and as such, the results should be interpreted accordingly.\nWe also investigated the potential role of chronic small vessel ischemia and A\u03b2 deposition. We found no significant association between the presence of WML and change in stroke-specific SUVR; however, we did find that significant decrease in hemisphere-specific SUVR was more likely in patients with some degree of WML. Our study was not designed to determine an association between WML and neocortical SUVR. There is growing evidence linking WML and A\u03b2 deposition, but the association has been variable. 27, 28 The finding of a nonsignificant higher 11 C-PiB retention in some patients is intriguing. This finding most likely reflects a breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), 23 suggesting that the higher 11 C-PiB accumulation is attributable to the leak of the radioactive ligand across the damaged BBB. 15, 29 It has been demonstrated that the BBB is impaired in the setting of an ischemic infarct 29 and that this damage is likely to permit diffusion of 11 C-PiB across the BBB. 30 The fact that significant decrease in the hemisphere-specific SUVR was more likely in patients with some degree of WML may also indicate the role of inherent weakness of the small vessels because of arteriolosclerosis resulting from the effects of vascular risk factors, such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus.\nHowever, we do not discount the possibility that the accumulation of 11 C-PiB may be due to acute A\u03b2 formation in the regions of the infarct. Garcia-Alloza et al 31 demonstrated the formation of A\u03b2 in the infarct region of induced stroke in a transgenic amyloid precursor protein mouse model. The accumulation of A\u03b2 was shown using real-time microscopy. This was a transient phenomenon and likely a reflection of the role of amyloid precursor protein in the acute inflammatory phase. It should be noted that 11 C-PiB does not significantly bind to nonsoluble A\u03b2 but rather to aggregated fibrils in neuritic plaque. 5 So, although this transient A\u03b2 formation is likely to reflect an amyloid precursor protein-driven response to injury in the first 40 days after stroke, binding of 11 C-PiB to soluble species is not, further suggesting that 11 C-PiB accumulation in the stroke area does not reflect specific binding but leakage of a radiolabeled substance across the damaged BBB.\nWe observed no significant 11 C-PiB accumulation in the infarct, peri-infarct, or stroke-affected hemispheric areas compared with the normal side in the follow-up phase of the study. The initial increase in 11 C-PiB accumulation in the area of infarct was no longer apparent. In fact, we found a significant decrease in the stroke-specific and hemisphere-specific SUVRs. This may have been the result of involutional changes after stroke resulting in decreased binding of 11 C-PiB. Our study saw a high attrition rate because of the inability to attend follow-up and death. This might have affected our findings, but we did not find a significant difference in the baseline demographic or imaging characteristics of the patients who returned for a second scan and those who did not aside from incident hypertension. We also acknowledge that we were able to do repeat scans in only 21 patients and \u226418 months after the initial stroke. A similar study in a larger number of patients with periodic repeat scans over a longer period of time may yield results different from ours. Unlike the study design stage, when the concept of power could be useful, once the study is completed, a much more relevant measure is the precision of the effect observed suggested by the 95% CI, which we have indicated for all the significant observed effects."}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "Overall, we conclude that an acute ischemic stroke does not lead to an increase in A\u03b2 deposition in the 18 months after stroke, either in the stroke region or across the brain generally. There was an initial increase in 11 C-PiB accumulation observed in the infarct region. On the basis of our findings, the possibility that the increased accumulation was because of transient A\u03b2 accumulation is unlikely. Furthermore, the 11 C-PiB accumulation was not sustained over time and most likely represents increased permeability of the BBB caused by ischemia. Our findings are in keeping with the results published by Marchant et al 12 and Mok et al 32 who also showed no significant increase in 11 C-PiB accumulation in patients with chronic cerebral vascular lesions."}, {"section_title": "Sources of Funding", "text": "This study was funded, in part, by National Health and Medical Research Council, Australia and support was provided by the Victorian State Government, Australia, via the Operational Infrastructure Scheme to the Florey Institute."}]
