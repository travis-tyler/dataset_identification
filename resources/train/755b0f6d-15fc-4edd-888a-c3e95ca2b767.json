In this study, we investigated the efficacy of a classification framework to distinguish early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI) from late mild cognitive impairment (LMCI) by using the effective features derived from functional brain network of three frequency bands (full-band: 0.01-0.08 Hz; slow-4: 0.027-0.08 Hz; slow-5: 0.01-0.027 Hz) at Rest.

Subsequently, three different algorithms [minimal redundancy maximal relevance (mRMR), sparse linear regression feature selection algorithm based on stationary selection (SS-LR), and Fisher Score (FS)] were applied to select the features of network attributes, respectively. Finally, we used the support vector machine (SVM) with nested cross validation to classify the samples into two categories to obtain unbiased results. Our results showed that the global efficiency, the local efficiency, and the average clustering coefficient were significantly higher in the slow-5 band for the LMCI-EMCI comparison, while the characteristic path length was significantly longer under most threshold values. The classification results showed that the features selected by the mRMR algorithm have higher classification performance than those selected by the SS-LR and FS algorithms.

According to the World Alzheimer's Disease Report in recent years (2, 3) , about 35.6 million people suffered from dementia in 2010, and global dementia care costs more than 600 billion US dollars or approximately 1% of the global GDP. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), commonly characterized by slight cognitive deficits but largely intact activities of daily living (4, 5) , is a transitional stage between the healthy aging and dementia that can be divided into EMCI and LMCI, according to extent of episodic memory impairment (6) . Research has shown that individuals with MCI tend to progress to AD at a rate of approximately 10-15% per year (7) . Jessen et al. (8) showed that the risk of LMCI conversion to AD is higher than that of EMCI. Identifying potentially high-sensitivity diagnostic markers that change with disease progression may assist the physician in making a diagnosis. If it is found at an early stage of MCI, patients can reduced the number of AD incidence by nearly one-third through rehabilitation exercises and medication (9) . Unfortunately, sensitive markers vary with disease progression (6) , and there are currently no definitive diagnostic biomarkers and effective treatments for AD (10) . Thus, early detection of EMCI individuals increasingly attaches clinical importance to potentially delaying or preventing the transition from EMCI to LMCI. Many experts study the early diagnosis of AD diseases from the aspects of neuropsychology, chemistry, and medical imaging. In clinical practice, doctors use the neuropsychological scale to diagnose and treat patients because of their simple operation, less time, and doubts. MCI patients have a certain sensitivity when they are initially tested and are widely used by clinicians (11) , but they are subjectively influenced by individuals. Individual differences are relatively large, and other diagnostic methods need to be combined to give the final diagnosis. In biochemistry, the levels of A\u03b2 and p-tau proteins in CSF are important biomarkers (12) . Studies have shown that the content of amyloid has increased before clinical symptoms appear, can be used for early prediction of clinical AD disease, but is not sensitive (13) . The content of p-tau protein in AD patients is significantly increased, with high sensitivity and specificity, and has certain reference value in clinical diagnosis (14) , but the detection of this index is traumatic, patients have certain rejection psychology, and clinical operation is more difficult. Compared with these methods, Hinrichs et al. (15) reported that clinical and imaging data [MRI and fludeoxyglucose (FDG-PET)] can be successfully combined to predict AD using machine-learning techniques. They found that the imaging modalities had a better performance in prediction of AD compared to clinical data.\nNeuroimaging research shows that MCI and AD patients have significant disruption compared with healthy control group in either the structural network or functional network (16) (17) (18) (19) . Several studies using the electroencephalogram (EEG) (20) and MRI (16, 17) have found abnormal clustering coefficients and characteristic path lengths in the brain networks of AD patients, implicating a loss of small-worldness attributes and disrupted whole brain organization network. Liu and Zhang (21) also used functional networks to detect betweenness centrality alteration in MCI and compared with AD group, showed decreased in the amygdala and rolandic operculum, and increased in the frontal gyrus, parietal gyrus, and medial temporal lobe. However, for MCI patients, changes in the brain are very subtle (19, 20) ; therefore, few studies have examined the characteristics of whole brain networks in different stages of MCI patients. Xiang and colleagues (22) used functional brain networks to study the abnormal brain connection in MCI and reported that the clustering coefficient in EMCI is higher than that of LMCI, while the average shortest path in LMCI is longer than that of EMCI. Although the difference was not significant, this method of analyzing functional brain network differences might provide an effective feature reference for the classification to distinguish EMCI from LMCI.\nRecently, several studies have demonstrated that the features obtained from functional brain network measures and machine learning approach based on rs-fMRI contribute useful information for more accurate classification. Chen et al. (23) used large-scale network (LSN) analysis with an AUC of 95% to classify subjects with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI n = 15) and cognitively normal (CN n = 20) subjects. Challis et al. (24) proposed GP-LR models and employed SVM with 75% accuracy to distinguish healthy subjects from subjects with amnesic mild cognitive impairment. Khazaee and colleagues (25) used time series to construct brain function network, and linear SVM classifiers were used to classify AD and normal people, which obtained 100% classification accuracy. This could be due to the small sample size, and the single variable Fisher Score feature selection algorithm was used. In another study, they extracted both temporal variabilities and spatial variabilities from dynamic connectivity networks (DCNs) as features, and integrate them for classification by using manifold regularized multi-task feature learning and multi-kernel learning techniques. The method they proposed yields the accuracy of 78.8% for LMCI and EMCI classification (26) . It has been shown that combination of the graph theory with machine learning approach on the basis of rs-fMRI can accurately classify patients with MCI, patients with AD, and normal subjects (22, 23) .\nHowever, most of the studies pooled EMCI and LMCI groups into a single larger MCI group (24, 25, 27) , and few studies investigated utility of rs-fMRI to distinguish two groups (25) . In addition, Zuo et al. (28) divided the BOLD signal into five bands: full-band (0.01-0.08 Hz), slow-2 (0.0198-0.25 Hz), slow-3 (0.073-0.0198 Hz), slow-4 (0.027-0.073 Hz), and slow-5 (0.01-0.027 Hz). Brain activity of MCI patients has significant differences in the posterior cingulate, hippocampus, and medial prefrontal regions in the slow-4 band and slow-5 band, and the classification of MCI by frequency division achieved a better classification result (29, 30) . Thus, the combination of functional brain networks and frequency division provides a new direction for classifying MCI patients.\nIn the current study, we aim to evaluate the efficacy of a classification framework to distinguish EMCI from LMCI by using the effective features derived from functional brain network of three frequency bands during Rest States. On the basis of classification result to find high-sensitivity features, we can better understand why sensitive markers in brain region vary with disease progression. We supposed that providing appropriate treatment and cognitive training for patients' highsensitivity brain region at different stages of the disease might be preventing the progression of AD transformation.\nFirstly, we preprocessed the signal and divided it into three frequency bands (full-band: 0.01-0.08 Hz; slow-4: 0.027-0.08 Hz; slow-5: 0.01-0.027 Hz) at Rest. Then, we constructed functional brain network by calculating Pearson's correlation coefficients between time series of all pairs of the brain regions and thresholded it to an undirected binary network. Several graph-theoretic parameters (global efficiency, local efficiency, characteristic path length, clustering coefficient, and smallworldness) were selected to measure the characteristics of functional brain networks. Nodal characteristics were examined at a high discriminative range of sparsity from 8 to 20%. At the feature selection step, we employed three different algorithms for selecting optimal feature. To obtain unbiased results, support vector machine (SVM) classifiers with nested cross validation were used for classification. Finally, we compared the performances of three feature selection methods from classification results. We supposed that classification results may be influenced by different bands and the classification results may be the best in the slow-5 band."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu).

The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early Alzheimer's disease (AD).\nThe demographic data of the datasets are listed in Table 1 . This study included 33 early MCI (EMCI) patients (average age 71.69 years, 19 female) and 29 late MCI (LMCI) patients (average age 70.73 years, 13 female). In the ADNI project, MCI diagnostic criteria included 1) Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores between 24 and 30, 2) a memory complaint, objective memory loss measured by education adjusted scores on the Wechsler Memory Scale Logical Memory II, 3) a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) of 0.5, and 4) absence of significant levels of impairment in other cognitive domains, essentially preserved activities of daily living, and an absence of dementia. As shown in ADNI project, the MCI stage was divided into EMCI and LMCI. Detailed diagnostic criteria of EMCI and LMCI: Both are characterized by evidence of AD biomarker abnormalities, with EMCI patients showing milder cognitive deficits. In terms of neuropsychological criteria, EMCI is defined as a performance 1-1.5 SD below the mean in one episodic memory test, identifying intermediate level of subtle memory impairment between normal cognition and MCI (31) . In Table 1 , we listed the p values of a Chi-Square test of gender and a two-sample t-test of age, CDR, and MMSE.

The edges were constructed by calculating Pearson's correlation coefficients between time series of all pairs of the brain regions. We applied Fisher's r-to-z transform on raw undirected connectivity matrix of the three bands to improve the normality of the partial correlation coefficients (18, 39) . By definition, this matrix is symmetric with a zero diagonal (no self-connections) (40) . To determine the available edges, each individual's brain network sparsity is thresholded as a binary matrix, where the edges are 1 if the weights of the two ROIs are larger than a given threshold, and 0 otherwise. The threshold represents the network connection cost, defined as the ratio of the suprathreshold connections relative to the total possible number of connections in the network (41) .\nThere is no straightforward rule for the definition of the single sparseness threshold, and different sparsenesses lead to different experimental results (17, 37) .

These results suggest that low frequency obtained by division frequency might achieve a better classification result. In addition, compared with the SS-LR and FS feature selection algorithms, the features selected by the mRMR algorithm have higher classification performance and the classification effect is more stable with the number of features increases. It suggests that selecting the appropriate feature selection method for the data set can help improve the classification accuracy. From the demographic data of the two groups ( Table 1) , there is no significant difference between MMSE and CDR, which indicates that the neuropsychological scale could not distinguish the patients with EMCI and LMCI in the clinic. Our classification framework demonstrates that efficient feature extraction and selection can effectively improve the classification of EMCI and LMCI.\nAs shown in Supplementary Figures 1, 2, and 3 , we used graph theory to calculate and analyze brain network functional differences between EMCI and LMCI. The results show that there are no significant differences in functional network properties between EMCI and LMCI in the slow-4 band. In the full-band, the global efficiency of LMCI is significantly higher than EMCI in a small part of the threshold, while the characteristic path length of LMCI is significantly longer than that of the small part of the threshold. In the slow-5 band, the global efficiency, the local efficiency, and the average clustering coefficient of LMCI are significantly higher than those of EMCI, respectively. Similarly, the LMCI characteristic path length is significantly longer than EMCI under most threshold values. Consistent with our findings, it has been shown that LMCI converters and EMCI converters showed a decreased path length and mean clustering compared with the MCI stables. Specifically, EMCI converters showed a decreased clustering coefficient, transitivity, modularity, and small-worldness compared with the LMCI converters in the Cost = 5-17% threshold range (57) . These findings align with Zhou's report (16) that MCI converters experience the worst local efficiency during the converting period to AD; however, the stables have highest local and global efficiency. They suggested that the abnormal brain network indicates a compensatory mechanism of local and global efficiency in these MCI stables.\nAs listed in Tables 2 and 3, the classification results show that the features selected by the mRMR algorithm have higher classification performance than those selected by the SS-LR and FS algorithms. For the mRMR algorithm, the classification results obtained in slow-5 band is more stable than that of slow-4 and full-band. As shown in Table 6 , the results of constructing brain function network classification EMCI and LMCI in slow-5 band is better than that of other studies constructing brain network (26, 52, (58) (59) (60) (61) (62) . Meanwhile, most previous methods (63-66) obtained accuracy <70% that constructed brain networks only considered structural feature. In brief, this study provides a valuable insight into the prediction of EMCI and LMCI conversion, and revealed that graph measures of resting-state fMRI are a potential predictor for classification. Our results suggested that brain activity in the slow-5 band carries more disease information and the top 10 selected features have high sensitivity for more efficient classification, compared with the slow-4 band and the full band. High sensitivity of functional network features, the frequently band segmentation of the signal, and the choice of the feature selection algorithm are critical to the classification.\nPrevious studies demonstrated connection abnormalities in the temporal lobe region in patients with AD (15, 17) . Liu et al. (67) also reported decreased complexities in lPreCG, STG, and MTG in familial AD. In agreement with these studies, we found that the temporal lobe region may be affected during the early stage of MCI. Specifically, we found that the betweenness centrality in the right inferior temporal gyrus (r-ITG) and the left superior temporal gyrus (l-STG) and the nodal degree in the left middle temporal gyrus were discriminative for separating EMCI from LMCI (Tables 4 and 5) . The MTG has the highest selectivity in the feature selection section. These results are consistent with other reports that MTG is the most important brain regions in the AD lesion (68, 69) . The MTG is located in the default network in the resting state network. Studies (70, 71) have shown that the default network in the resting state network of AD patients is abnormal compared to the normal elderly. Other studies have shown that a large amount of A\u03b2 deposition is found FIGURE 7 | The location and networks attribution of top 10 brain regions, listed in Table 4 , which might be affected in early stage of MCI in sagittal views. The blue ball represents BC, the red ball represents NL, and the green ball represents ND. in the temporal lobe region, indicating that this brain region is an important region in the development of AD disease (14) . All of these results suggest that changes in the structure and function of the MTG region are more sensitive to the development of AD disease. Some of other sensitive brain regions, such as l-CUN and r-ITG, were also reported in previous study using PE method to analyze the complexity of the same ADNI dataset (72) . Studying the structural and functional network results of AD suggests that cognitive impairment in patients may be caused by abnormal connections between different brain regions in the temporal lobe (70, 73) . The area of the ITG plays an important role in maintaining language fluency (74). Hojjati and colleagues (52) demonstrated capability of rs-fMRI to predict conversion from MCI to AD by identifying affected brain regions (i.e., l-CUN, l-ROL, l-STG, r-CAU, r-ITG) underlying this conversion, and they proposed the ITG is an essential area in the verbal fluency circuit. Therefore, they suggested that these results might be indicative of disruption in communication between the ITG and other regions involved in this cognitive function in early stage of AD. For the caudate nucleus (CUN) region, Persson's study found that larger caudate nucleus volume in AD patients and further discussed this region possibly serving as a mechanism for temporary compensation (75) . Consistent with this structural MRI finding, our results revealed the functional connection abnormalities of r-CAU in early AD. Niu et al. (69) revealed significant differences in the OLF.R, l-IOG, l-MTG, and other brain regions on multiple time scales for four stages of AD. Khazaee and colleagues (19) suggested that patients with AD experience disturbance of l-ROL, r-ITG, and l-STG in their brain network as AD progresses. Our findings converge nicely with what has been suggested by the previous MRI studies ( [76] [77] [78] , and these selected brain regions have been shown to be related with MCI conversion. In summary, the highly sensitive characteristic found that the features selected using the mRMR algorithm in the integrated all band and slow-5 band are overlapping, indicating that the information contained in the slow-5 band is more distinguishable. Moreover, selected brain regions carry more disease information with highly sensitive characteristic leading to more efficient classification. The important role of temporal lobe in MCI disease has been widely recognized. We suggested that the other regions (Right caudate nucleus, Left Heschl gyrus, Left Inferior occipital gyrus, Left Rolandic operculum, etc.) deserve researchers pay attention to explore the role of these brain regions in the MCI disease."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "In this study, we investigated the efficacy of a classification framework to distinguish individuals with EMCI and LMCI by using the effective features derived from functional brain network of three frequency bands during Resting States. Without requiring other new biomarkers, our approach shows that the functional network features selected by mRMR algorithm improves the discrimination between EMCI and LMCI, compared with those selected by the SS-LR and FS algorithms. Moreover, the selected brain regions and frequency band are interpretable and consistent with previous studies. By comparing classification results, we found that the selected slow-5 band shows more stable and better performances compared with other bands. Ultimately, such a classification framework for the whole brain overall organization could substantially extend our understanding on the classification of MCI, shedding light on the novel potential diagnostic markers (highly sensitive features) located brain regions. This study has several limitations. A larger sample size and the consideration of including other degrees of severity in AD series and dementias in future work are essential to evaluate the variability and stability of functional networks for classification results. Another limitation related to network characteristics is the construction of undirected networks, ignoring the direction of information dissemination. Moreover, other findings indicated that any comparison of network parameters across studies must be made with reference to the spatial scale of the nodal parcellation (79); hence, we will evaluate the results of Power-264 brain regions for our method. The multimodality classification approach yields "}]
