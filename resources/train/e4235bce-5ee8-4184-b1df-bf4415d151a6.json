[{"section_title": "Background", "text": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (abbreviated \"COVID-19\") is an infectious respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus, first identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. It is a large class of viruses that have been relatively widespread all across the world. The virus has low pathogenicity and high transmissibility capacity [1] . The Chinese authorities in Wuhan City, the capital of the province of Hubei, China, first announced this at the end of December 2019 [2] [3] [4] [5] . After originating in Wuhan China last December 2019, COVID-19 has spread to at least 200 countries and region. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak was declared a public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization (WHO) [6] . According to the WHO, the outbreak of coronavirus disease in 2019 (COVID -19) has been a pandemic that infected more than 5 million people at the time of writing this protocol and caused more than 324,000 deaths and 1.7 million recoveries worldwide within the 6 months duration [7] . Of the total cases, 15% develop severe disease, including pneumonia, and 5% become critically ill with respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multi-organ failure [8] .\nThe geriatric age groups were the most vulnerable age group and the Wuhan virus killing mostly the elderly. Of the 70-to 79-year-olds infected with coronavirus there, 8% have died. Among the over-80s, the case fatality rate is 15% [9] .\nA modeling study in Africa, classifying African countries as having high risk with 13 top WHO highest priority (Egypt, Algeria, and South Africa), moderate risk (Nigeria, Ethiopia, Morocco, Sudan, Angola, Tanzania, Ghana, and Kenya) and all other countries had low to moderate importation risk. The fatality rate of COVID in north African countries expected to be 11.02% [10, 11] .\nGenerally speaking, African countries have poor health systems and this remains a source of concern, particularly in the event of an increase in outbreaks [12] . Due to this reason at the end of the pandemic, Africa might have some of the worst consequences of this COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn the WHO Africa region alone 83,000 to 190, 000 people could die of COVID-19 and 29 million to 44 million could get infected in the first year of the pandemic if nt measurement will not be taken. The research, which is based on prediction modeling, looks at 47 countries in the WHO African Region with a total population of 1 million. There would be an estimation of 3.6 to 5.5 million COVID-19 hospitalizations, of those 82, 000 to 167,000 would be severe cases requiring oxygen, and 52,000 to 107,000 would be critical cases requiring breathing support [13] .\nThere were different reports regarding the COVID-19 [14] [15] [16] but; there are no pooled results regarding the outcome of COVID-19 among the geriatric age group in Africa. Therefore, this study protocol will be guided to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the outcome of COVID-19 among the geriatric age group in Africa."}, {"section_title": "Protocol registration", "text": "This review is registered in PROSPERO International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (CRD42020180600) (https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO)) and reported according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and MetaAnalysis protocol (PRISMA-P) guidelines [17] ( Table 1) ."}, {"section_title": "Search strategy and data extraction", "text": "The search strategy has been applied using Online Databases (PubMed / MEDLINE, Google Scholar, Google, EMBASE, Web of Science, Microsoft Academic, WHO COVID-19 database, Cochran Library, Africa Wide Knowledge, and Africa Index Medicus) from March to August 2020 (Table 2 ).

Forest plots will be drawn to visualize the combined outcome of COVID-19 and the extent of statistical heterogeneity between studies. Statistical heterogeneity will be assessed using the\u03c72 test on Cochrane's Q statistic, 20 and quantified by calculating the I 2 statistic (with values of 25, 50, and 75% is representative of the low, medium, and high heterogeneity, respectively) [19] . There will be a clinical heterogeneity between studies included in this study. The random-effects will be used to estimate the overall pooled outcome of COVID-19 in Africa. The presence of publication bias will be assessed using Egger's test and funnel plots [20] . P-value < 0.10 on the Egger's test will be considered statistically significant for publication bias. Moreover, other relevant findings will be summarized in a narrative format. The crude numerators and denominators from the individual studies will be used to recalculate the studyspecific outcome of COVID-19. The outcome estimates will be summarized by African geographic regions. A meta-analysis will be performed on variables that are similar across the included studies.\nA subgroup analyses will be performed based on the countries where the study conducted, diagnostic method they used, based on their ethnic background (African origin and -non-African ethnic origin).
