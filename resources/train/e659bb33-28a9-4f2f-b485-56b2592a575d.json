Age-related declines in physical function and morphological health further contribute to exaggerated risk at the individual level; yet increases in the incidence of diagnosed diabetes, combined with declining mortality or increased life expectancy, have led to an acceleration of lifetime risk and more years spent with diabetes at the population level [2] . Early screening and promotion efforts for healthy aging among higher-risk populations are thus vital to reduce incidence and preventable comorbidities, as well as to curtail the escalating healthcare burden associated with diabetes.\nOf particular relevance to both, there is increasingly compelling evidence to highlight the importance of muscular strength as a protective factor for health across populations. Perhaps the quintessential example of this is represented by the growing body of survival studies that demonstrate an independent association between muscle weakness and early, cardiovascular and all-cause mortality [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . The contribution of muscle atrophy and weakness to progression of secondary complications with aging and/or disease (e.g. frailty and mobility disability) is equally unequivocal, and recent national efforts to identify cut points or thresholds for weakness among older adults [9] [10] [11] will aid clinicians to screen individuals with greatest risk.\nWhat remains to be fully understood is the extent to which strength preservation is associated with protection from cardiometabolic diseases, such as diabetes, and, moreover, whether age-and sex-specific cut points for strength can be established for risk stratification. Senechal et al. [12] showed that low strength is independently associated with increased odds of the metabolic syndrome in middle-aged and older men, and they were able to identify cut points for low normalized strength that best predicted increased risk. Two very recent studies from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) demonstrated that greater adiposity [13] and chronic hyperglycaemia [14] (two hallmark features of diabetes) are associated with persistently lower muscle quality and strength, respectively, and that these secondary consequences may be mediated by neurological factors, such as neuropathy. We and others have shown an independent, inverse association between low strength and cardiometabolic risk clustering even among adolescents [15] [16] [17] , reiterating the need for early and improved clinical screening strategies across populations. Therefore, the purposes of this study were to examine the independent association between handgrip strength capacity and diabetes in a large, nationally representative sample and to explore potential age-and sex-specific thresholds of weakness, for optimal risk categorization."}, {"section_title": "Research Design and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study Population", "text": "The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is a programme of studies designed to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the USA.

Nonfasting serum measures of HbA 1c were included as a diagnostic test for diabetes, which reflected average plasma glucose levels for the previous &3 months. For a subset of individuals, fasting measures were obtained for plasma glucose and insulin, as well as a 2-h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). For fasting glucose and insulin, the Homeostasis Model of Assessment (HOMA) score was calculated according to the following formula: [insulin (I) 0 in lU per mL 9 glucose (G) 0 in mmol per L]/22.5. For the OGTT, eligible participants were administered a 75 g glucose load (Trutol) [or a calibrated dose for participants weighing \\94 pounds (\\42.64 kg)], and a blood sample was drawn 2 h later.

Detailed descriptions of the protocol are provided in the NHANES Muscle Strength Procedures Manual [21] . Briefly, a trained examiner explained and demonstrated the protocol to the participant, then adjusted the grip size of the dynamometer to the participant's hand size and asked the participant to squeeze the dynamometer for a practice trial. Thereafter, the participant was randomly assigned to start the test with his/her dominant or non-dominant hand, and was asked to squeeze the dynamometer as hard as possible, exhaling while squeezing. The test was then repeated for the opposite hand. Each hand was tested three times, alternating hands between trials, with a 60-s rest between measurements on the same hand. The grip test was performed in the standing position unless the participant was physically limited. Participants were excluded from this component if they were unable to hold the dynamometer and perform strength testing with both hands. Participants who had undergone surgery on either hand or wrist within the previous 3 months were not tested on that particular hand. Since there is substantial covariance between strength capacity and body mass-and, moreover, the links between muscle strength and both physical function and chronic health are mediated by the proportion of strength relative to body mass-grip strength was normalized as strength per body mass [i.e. (grip strength in kg)/(body mass in kg)]."}, {"section_title": "Potential Covariate: Sedentary Behaviour", "text": "Sedentary behaviour was determined during the 2011-2012 NHANES cohort through questionnaires (variable name prefix PAQ), which was based on the World Health Organization's Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ) [22, 23] .

Further, we took into account subsample weights, since we conducted analysis on persons with non-fasting glucose measurements. These weights were used to produce unbiased estimates. To obtain correct variance estimation, information on the strata and primary sampling unit (PSU) were also utilized.

A similar strategy was used to test differences for outcomes between men and women across equivalent age categories. To assess the odds of diabetes or IR in the entire sample, we utilized the multivariate logistic regression modelling approach with the forward and backward selection procedure. Known risk factors-including sex, age, waist circumference, race, sedentary behaviour and normalized strength-were adjusted for in the model.

Age-and sex-specific thresholds for high strength and low strength are provided in Table 3 , with corresponding risk percentages for diabetes [i.e. HbA 1c level C6.5 % (C48 mmol/mol)]. These thresholds may, therefore, be used to categorize individuals into three categories of risk (i.e. low, medium and high risk) on the combined basis of sex, age, body mass and combined grip strength capacity. Figure 2 illustrates the non-parametric curves between the logit of the predicted risk of diabetes (x axis) and normalized strength (y axis), with age-and sex-specific low-and high-strength thresholds represented with vertical bars corresponding to the lower and upper tertiles of the predicted risks."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The principal finding of this study was that normalized grip strength is significantly associated with type 2 diabetes in men and women of all ages, even after controlling for known sociodemographic, anthropometric and behavioural predictors. Specifically, for every 5 % decrement in the strength to body mass ratio, there were 26 % increased adjusted odds of diabetes. These findings lend additional support to the growing body of literature revealing a strong link between muscle strength and reduced risk of metabolic abnormalities and cardiovascular diseases. Our results suggest that grip strength testing may be valuable as a simple screening strategy for diabetes risk detection among adults. Herein, we provide unique sex-and age-specific thresholds of strength to predict diabetes on the basis of HbA 1c levels, according to the American Diabetes Association diagnostic criteria [i.e. C6.5 % (C48 mmol/mol)] [25, 26] . Importantly, our modelling technique allowed for the identification of two strength cutpoints and three respective risk categories, which may be incorporated into a clinical setting for screening adults who are at low, medium and high risk of developing diabetes. In this study, we identified the highest risk of diabetes as coinciding with normalized strength of B0.56, 0.50 and 0.45 for men at ages of 20-39, 40-59 and 60-80 years, respectively, and 0.42, 0.38 and 0.33 for women at ages of 20-39, 40-59 and 60-80 years, respectively. As an example, a 50-year-old woman who has a body weight of 75 kg and grip strength of 26 kg has a normalized strength of 0.347 and thus would be categorized as 'high risk' for diabetes, i.e. below the low-strength threshold of 0.38 for those sex and age categories.\nSuch thresholds may also be useful in identifying individuals who could benefit from lifestyle interventions to improve muscular fitness and reduce risk. Indeed, among adults with and without existing risk factors, various studies have reported significantly improved insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance with structured resistance exercise interventions [27, 28] . Since resistance exercise is known to elicit a potent insulin-sensitizing effect for hours after a single bout of training [29] [30] [31] , there is some speculation about whether it is merely the repeated acute responses to habitual training that drive benefits for metabolic health, rather than any adaptive response per se. Regardless, progressive resistance exercise is a well-documented stimulus to induce both acute and chronic metabolic changes, attributable to decreases in hyperinsulinaemia, improved insulin-stimulated glucose disposal and enhanced insulin sensitivity [27, 32] , and has recently been shown to substantially reduce the risk of prospective diabetes incidence in two large cohorts of middle-aged and older women [33] . Conversely, muscular atrophy and weakness are closely linked with chronic hyperglycaemia and diabetes, particularly with advancing age. As with all cross-sectional studies, a limitation of this investigation was the inability to disentangle the cause-effect relationship between predictors and outcomes. Whether lower relative strength capacities 'cause' an elevated risk of diabetes, or whether comorbid cardiometabolic abnormalities (e.g. diabetes or pulmonary disorders) or musculoskeletal conditions (e.g. carpal tunnel syndrome, diabetic cheiroarthropathy or flexor tenosynovitis) are themselves a cause of diminished muscle function (i.e. reverse causality) is an interesting and complex topic. Moreover, we were unable to determine if other competing risks or unmeasured confounding (e.g. time spent in different categories of physical activity or exercise participation) may have influenced the observed estimates. In their BLSA study, Kalyani et al. [14] suggested that longitudinal declines in muscle strength and quality were driven by neurological factors, such as neuropathy. While there is certainly evidence to explicate the role of diabetic complications in neuromuscular function, there is also an enormous body of literature to verify the independent link between declines in physical fitness and increased diabetes risk. For individuals at elevated risk of chronic hyperglycaemia and/or diabetes, these phenomena transpire as an accelerated circular cause and consequence of events. There is thus a dire need for more patient-specific clinical studies to identify optimal interventions that may concurrently target preservation of muscle strength capacity and achieve or maintain cardiometabolic health. Because regular exercise and drug interventions are similar in terms of their mortality benefits in secondary prevention of heart disease, rehabilitation after stroke and prevention of diabetes [34] , a simplistic clinical directive that could dramatically reduce the total healthcare burden is to continue encouraging healthy lifestyles that lead to regular participation in physical activity, preservation of muscular fitness and healthy weight achievement/maintenance. Not surprisingly, nearly all research related to the influence of obesity and related cardiometabolic abnormalities to potentiate the risk of secondary muscle dysfunction have been conducted within the context of an agerelated phenomenon. However, the underlying changes in metabolic dysregulation leading to a disease such as diabetes should be regarded as a gradual continuous process throughout the lifespan rather than a discrete outcome or event. We have previously shown that even among nonobese, otherwise healthy adults, adiposity is a strong negative mediator of the relationship between muscle size and strength capacity [35] . Recent data also suggest a 'lipotoxic' effect of local adipose tissue deposition on muscular function and musculoskeletal integrity [36] [37] [38] . Thus, further evaluation of the temporal sequence of these consequences is of particular importance not only for early screening efforts to reduce diabetes progression and secondary comorbidities, but also for understanding of the roles of obesity and diabetes in the acceleration of functional declines leading to exaggerated sedentariness and mobility disability. Moreover, future research is needed to better understand the role of weakness and/or strength declines as a risk exposure for diabetes in the context of different races and ages.\nOther recent efforts to calculate thresholds of weakness have used various statistical methods for defining absolute values of strength that correspond with mobility disability and early mortality among aging adults [9] [10] [11] . However, since there is a substantial covariance between strength capacity and body mass-and, moreover, the links between muscle strength and both physical function and chronic health are directly mediated by the proportion of strength relative to body mass-normalization to body mass is critical to improve the sensitivity of cutpoint values and screening efforts. Future research is certainly needed to devise strength growth curves that may be used for the purpose of normative reference testing in clinical, academic and community settings."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "The purposes of this study were to examine the link between strength capacity and diabetes in a large, nationally representative sample and to explore thresholds of weakness, for optimal risk categorization. We found that normalized grip strength [measured as (grip strength in kg)/(body mass in kg)] was robustly associated with diabetes in adults, even after adjustment for various known covariates, such as age, waist circumference, important sociodemographic variables and sedentary behaviour. Moreover, we present new age-and sex-specific thresholds of normalized strength, which could be incorporated into a clinical setting for identifying adults who are at low, intermediate and high risk of developing diabetes. Future research is needed to create unique risk categorization algorithms that are specific to other clinical and global health outcomes, as well as to examine the longitudinal trajectories of strength change as an indicator of incident cardiometabolic disease and even early mortality. Such efforts will dramatically improve the personalization of screening, stratification and clinical decision making at the individual patient level."}]
