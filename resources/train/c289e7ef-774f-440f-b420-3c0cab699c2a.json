These comparisons shed light on a host of issues, including access to education, equity of resources, and outcomes such as educational attainment and performance on standardized tests. They provide the opportunity to compare different aspects of countries' education systems, consider these systems' performance, and suggest potential strategies to improve student achievement and system outputs. Since the 1960s, the United States has participated actively in international projects that are designed to provide key information about the performance of the U.S. education system relative to education systems in other countries. These projects include the Indicators of Education Systems (INES) program and Program for International Student Assessment (PISA), both sponsored by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), and the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS) and Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), both sponsored by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement. This report, Comparative Indicators of Education in the United States and Other G-8 Countries: 2011, draws on the most current information available at the time the report was being produced (in the fall of 2010) to present a set of education indicators that describes how the U.S. education system compares with education systems in other economically developed countries. Updated information from these various projects will be incorporated in subsequent reports. Although the international education projects cited above involve many countries worldwide, the comparisons in this report focus on the Group of Eight (G-8) countries: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom, and the United States. While together the G-8 countries make up about 13 percent of the world population, they represent about 53 percent of the gross world product (GWP) as measured by gross domestic product (GDP) (Central Intelligence Agency 2011). Moreover, all of the G-8 countries are among the 15 top-ranked countries in terms of merchandise exports [on a free on board (FOB) basis] and in terms of the value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given year valued at prices prevailing in the United States [i.e., GDP at purchasing power parity (PPP) exchange rates]. The G-8 countries were selected as a comparison group because of the similarities in their economic development and because the other G-8 countries are among the major economic partners of the United States. The leaders of these countries meet regularly to discuss economic and other policy issues. Although the G-20 represents a broader range of major economies, this larger number of countries is more diverse economically (including both industrialized and emerging market economies) and in their education systems, thus making international comparative indicators more difficult to develop and interpret. Also, for the indicators presented in this report, there is generally more data available for the G-8 countries than for the G-20. In this report, \"education system\" is used as a construct in presenting national statistics on education in the G-8 countries. It is important to note, however, that there is considerable variation among countries in how unified these systems are, including variation in the level of local autonomy. For example, while Japan and France have education systems that are highly centralized, the United States and Canada have education systems that are largely decentralized."}, {"section_title": "What's New in 2011?", "text": "This report is the fifth in a series of reports published by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) that describes how the education system in the United States compares with education systems in the other G-8 countries. Many of the indicators draw on 2008 data from the OECD's INES program, in which countries collaborate to develop comparable education data on topics of mutual interest. In addition, while previous reports in this series have presented data from PIRLS, TIMSS, and earlier rounds of PISA, the indicators in this report related to international assessment draw only from PISA, with a focus on data from the most recent administration in 2009 that was released in December 2010. Neither of the other major international assessments-PIRLS or TIMSS-has released data since the last G-8 report was published in 2009.

A brief overview of the education levels is presented here to provide the reader with a frame of reference while reading the indicators (see appendix A for more detailed descriptions). To ensure comparability in the indicators across countries, each country restructured its national education data to correspond with the definitions of education levels that were developed in the 1997 revision of the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED97) (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization [UNESCO] 1997). The following descriptions highlight the key features of (1) education programs from preprimary through secondary education and (2) higher education programs."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Preprimary education includes programs of education for children at least 3 years of age that involve organized, center-based instructional activities; in most countries, preprimary education is not compulsory. Primary education includes programs that are designed to give students a sound basic education in reading, writing, and mathematics, along with an elementary understanding of other subjects, such as history, geography, science, art, and music. In the international classification, primary education usually begins at the start of compulsory education (around age 6) and lasts for 6 years. Secondary education encompasses two stages: lower secondary education and upper secondary education. Lower secondary education includes programs that are designed to complete basic education; the standard duration in the international classification is 3 years. Upper secondary education is designed to provide students with more in-depth knowledge of academic or vocational subjects and to prepare them for higher level academic or vocational studies or entry into the labor market. The standard duration of upper secondary education in the international classification is 3 years. Higher education includes tertiary programs 1 that fall into three main categories: \u2022 Academic higher education below the doctoral level. These largely theory-based programs are intended to provide sufficient qualifications to gain entry into advanced research programs and professions with high skill requirements. To be classified as such, a degree program must last at least 3 years and is typically preceded by at least 13 years of formal schooling. In the United States, bachelor's, master's, and first professional degree programs are classified at this level. \u2022 Vocational higher education. These programs provide a higher level of career and technical education beyond secondary school and are designed to prepare students for the labor market. In the international classification, these programs last 2 to 4 years. In the United States, associate's degree programs are classified at this level. \u2022 Doctoral level of academic higher education. These programs usually require the completion of a research thesis or dissertation. The international classification also includes an education level that straddles the boundary between upper secondary and higher education: postsecondary nontertiary education. These programs of study-which are primarily vocational in nature-are generally taken after the completion of upper secondary education. They are often not significantly more advanced than upper secondary programs, but they serve to extend the skills of participants who have already completed upper secondary education. In the United States, these programs are often in the form of occupationally specific vocational certificate programs, such as 1-year certification programs offered at technical institutes or community colleges. 2\n"}, {"section_title": "Mapping G-8 Countries' Education Systems to the ISCED97", "text": "Matching the education levels of individual countries to the ISCED97 classification can be challenging, because the particulars of individual countries seldom fit ISCED97 perfectly.

As an aid to the reader, schematics of how the ISCED97 applies to each of the G-8 countries are provided in appendix A, accompanied by text describing each system in greater detail."}, {"section_title": "Organization of the Report", "text": "The report begins with a summary section that highlights key findings; it then presents 21 indicators that compare different aspects of the education system in the United States to education systems in other G-8 countries. The indicators are organized into the following sections: \u2022 population and school enrollment; \u2022 academic performance; \u2022 context for learning; \u2022 expenditures for education; and \u2022 educational attainment and income. The first section, population and school enrollment, presents indicators that suggest the potential demand for education in countries as measured by the size and growth of their school-age population and current and past levels of enrollment in formal education. The section concludes with an indicator that examines the extent to which foreign students are enrolled in higher education across the G-8 countries. The next section, academic performance, has indicators pertaining to 15-year-olds' achievement in reading, mathematics, and science. There is an emphasis on reading given that this subject area was the focus of PISA 2009, and several indicators present data from two time points using PISA data. The indicators in this section present findings on student performance in reading, mathematics, and science; change in performance; change in performance by sex; and performance by immigrant status. There are also two indicators that look separately at low performing and high performing students. The third section highlights a range of issues pertaining to the context for learning across the G-8 countries. This section presents data on class size and ratio of students to teaching staff and two indicators using data from PISA 2000 and 2009: the reports of 15-year-old students on their time spent reading for enjoyment and the reports of school principals about the various purposes for which assessments of 15-year-old students are used at their schools. The fourth section provides a comparative look at expenditures for education, including breakdowns by expenditures as a percentage of a country's gross domestic product (GDP) and the portion of total education expenditures devoted to core services. 3 This section also presents information on change in education expenditures and public school teacher salaries in primary and secondary education. The final section, educational attainment and income, focuses on graduation rates, educational attainment, employment rates, and earnings (including breakdowns by sex and field of study for some of these areas). Each indicator is presented in a two-page format. The first page presents key findings that highlight how the United States compares with its G-8 peers (with data available) on the issue examined in the indicator. The key findings are followed by a section that defines the terms used in the indicator and describes key features of the methodology used to produce it. The second page presents graphical depictions of the data that support the key findings.

These data are derived from annual data collections carried out by OECD, with member countries' data coming from a variety of national data sources, including administrative data collections, school surveys, household surveys, and national financial reports. Most of the indicator data for the United States come from the Current Population Survey (CPS) of the U.S. Census Bureau, the NCES Common Core of Data (CCD), the NCES Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), and the NCES Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS). \u2022 PISA data.

In indicators using INES data, this is the result of source data not being reported; the \"reporting\" G-8 countries in these indicators vary somewhat, and these are shown in each indicator. In PISA, data for the United Kingdom are not reported in 2000 and 2003 due to low response rates. In other instances, PISA data may not be reported for a country due to the data not being collected or reporting standards not being met. These instances are noted in each indicator where relevant. The United Kingdom includes England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales. In one indicator (indicator 14), data for England and Scotland are shown separately and in place of data for the entire United Kingdom. Every effort was made to use the most up-to-date data available across the G-8 countries (usually from 2008 or 2009), though sometimes the latest data available from a country are from an earlier year. To make this clear to the reader, these occurrences are noted in relevant tables and figures."}, {"section_title": "Data Quality and Response Rates", "text": "PISA has established technical standards of data quality including participation and response rate standards that countries must meet in order to be included in the comparative results.

Consistent with NCES statistical standards, item response rates less than 85 percent are footnoted in the tables and figures of this report, as well as instances where reporting standards are not met because of too few observations to provide reliable estimates."}, {"section_title": "Statistical Testing", "text": "Thirteen of the indicators presented in this report (indicators 1-4, 11, 14-21) are derived either from administrative records that are based on universe collections or from national sample surveys for which standard errors were not available. Consequently, for these indicators, no tests of statistical significance were conducted to establish whether observed differences from the U.S. average were statistically significant. However, for the eight other indicators derived from PISA data (indicators 5-10, 12, and 13), standard t tests were calculated for comparisons of estimates within or between countries (e.g., to test whether a U.S. estimate is statistically different from other G-8 countries' estimates).

However, because of different reference dates for school enrollment and population data within the reference year, enrollment rates may exceed 100 percent for some countries and some age groups. Enrollments include all full-time and part-time students in public and private institutions. Enrollment in education at the preprimary level (typically ages 3 to 5) includes children in kindergarten, preschool, nursery, or center-based day-care programs and excludes children in day-care programs operated in homes. Thus, for a program to be considered as preprimary education, it has to be school-based or center-based. These terms are used to distinguish activities in settings such as preschools and kindergartens from services provided in households or family settings. Such programs are designed for children who are at least 3 years old; this age has been chosen since programs destined for younger children do not normally satisfy the educational criteria defined by the 1997 International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED97). For more information on the ISCED97 levels, see appendix A. The ending age of compulsory education is the age at which individuals are no longer legally required to participate in formal education.   \nThe percentage of the population at given ages enrolled in education is called an \"enrollment rate.\" In this indicator, the term \"enrollment rate\" refers to the \"net enrollment rate\" and is defined as the number of students in a particular age group enrolled in education divided by the population of that same age group.

For more information on the ISCED97 levels, see appendix A. 3  Kingdom,Canada,France,France,Germany,Italy,Japan,Russian Federation,United Kingdom,United States Over the past 35 years, the number of foreign students (i.e., students enrolled outside their country of citizenship) in higher education has more than quadrupled: from 0.6 million worldwide in 1975 to 3.3 million in 2008 (OECD 2010a). In 2008, G-8 countries (as countries of destination) hosted 59 percent of all foreign students in higher education (figure 4-1). Among G-8 countries, the United States received the largest percentage of foreign students (19 percent), followed by the United Kingdom (10 percent). The other G-8 countries each took in between 2 and 7 percent of all foreign students enrolled in higher education. In terms of the percentage of a country's students enrolled in higher education who are foreign students, foreign students made up a larger percentage of enrollments in higher education in the United Kingdom (20 percent), Canada (13 percent), France (11 percent), and Germany (11 percent) than in the United States 8 (3 percent) (figure 4-2). In the Russian Federation, foreign students made up 1 percent of the total enrollment in higher education, lower than in all other G-8 countries. Across the G-8 countries, foreign students made up a larger percentage of enrollments in academic higher education at the doctoral level than at the pre-doctoral level. At the pre-doctoral level of academic higher education, foreign students made up the largest percentage of enrollment in the United Kingdom, at 21 percent. At the doctoral level of academic higher education, foreign students made up more than 25 percent of the enrollment in four out of the six G-8 countries reporting data: the United Kingdom (48 percent), France (40 percent), Canada (39 percent), and the United States (28 percent).\nForeign students are defined as noncitizens enrolled in education programs in a host country, and thus some permanent residents are included. International students are defined as students who enrolled in institutions in other countries, and thus do not include permanent residents. As shown in the figures, education levels are defined according to the 1997 International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED97). For more information on the ISCED97 levels, see appendix A.\nThe Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) is a system of international assessments that measures 15-year-old students' performance in reading literacy, mathematics literacy, and science literacy every 3 years. Each PISA cycle assesses one of the three subject areas in depth, including subscales and an overall scale score in the focal subject. In PISA 2009, reading literacy was the subject area assessed in depth, with results available in three reading literacy subscales. In PISA 2009, a smaller portion of the assessment was devoted to mathematics than in PISA 2003, when mathematics was the major subject area, and a smaller portion of the assessment was devoted to science than in PISA 2006, when science was the major subject area. For information about how reading literacy, mathematics literacy, and science literacy are defined in the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA), see the Definitions and Methodology section of indicator 8. In PISA 2009, students were assessed on their reading literacy in relation to varying text types, reading processes, and situations or contexts, which were reflected in three subscales: access and retrieve, integrate and interpret, and reflect and evaluate. The access-and-retrieve subscale involves finding, selecting, and collecting information. Sometimes the information being sought is directly and plainly stated in the text; other times, more than one piece of information is required and knowledge of text structures and features may be called upon. The integrate-and-interpret subscale involves processing what is read to make internal sense of a text. Integrating tasks require readers to understand the relation(s) between different parts of a text, such as cause-effect, category-example, and compare-contrast. Interpreting refers to the process of making meaning from something that is not stated, whereby readers identify the underlying assumptions or implications of part or all of the text. The reflect-and-evaluate subscale involves drawing on knowledge, ideas, or values external to the text. When reflecting and evaluating, readers need to connect information in a text to knowledge from outside sources. To do so, readers must be able to develop an understanding of what is said and intended in a text and then test this mental representation against what they know and believe on the basis of either prior information or information found in other texts. In PISA 2009, scores are reported on a scale from 0 to 1,000. In reading literacy, the average score across OECD countries is 493 with a standard deviation of 93. In mathematics literacy, the average score across OECD countries is 496 with a standard deviation of 92. In science literacy, the average score across OECD countries is 501 with a standard deviation of 94. In PISA, \"15-year-olds\" refers to students who are between 15 years and 3 months old and 16 years and 2 months old at the time of the assessment and who have completed at least 6 years of formal schooling. This indicator focuses on high-performing students in the G-8 countries in 2009. PISA reports the percentage of students in each country reaching several proficiency levels that describe the kinds of skills students demonstrated in the assessment. For each subject area, PISA describes six proficiency levels ranging from the most advanced at level 6 to the lowest at level 1. An additional category (below level 1) includes students whose skills are not developed sufficiently to be described by PISA. This indicator focuses on high-performing students in the G-8 countries in 2009 by showing the percentage of 15-year-olds who perform above PISA level 4 in each of the three subject areas. In mathematics literacy, for example, students at this high level of proficiency can use well-developed reasoning skills, insight, and interpretation with different representations; interpret complex information about real-world situations; work strategically; use complex and multistep problem-solving skills; and make assumptions or work with assumptions to solve problems (see OECD 2010c for a complete description of each PISA proficiency level in each subject area). As an additional way of presenting information about high-performing students, this indicator also shows the lowest scores of the top 10 percent of students in each G-8 country in each subject area. On the PISA 2009 reading literacy scale, Japan and Canada had higher percentages of 15-year-old students scoring above level 4 than all other G-8 countries (figure 6-1). In the United States, 10 percent of 15-year-old students scored above level 4. This was a lower percentage than in Japan and Canada (both 13 percent); not measurably different than the percentages in France (10 percent) and the United Kingdom (8 percent); and a higher percentage than in Germany (8 percent), Italy (6 percent), and the Russian Federation (3 percent). A similar pattern was found with the lowest scores of the top 10 percent of students. Those scores were higher in Japan and Canada than in all other G-8 countries (figure 6-2). In the United States, the lowest score of the top 10 percent of students on the reading literacy scale was 625. This was a lower score than in Japan (639) and Canada (637); not measurably different than the scores in France (624), the United Kingdom (616), and Germany (615); and a higher score than in Italy (604) and the Russian Federation (572). On the PISA 2009 mathematics literacy scale, Japan had a higher percentage of students scoring above level 4 than all other G-8 countries, except Canada (there was no measurable difference between Japan and Canada) (figure 6-1). In the United States, 10 percent of students scored above level 4. This was a lower percentage than in Japan (21 percent), Canada (18 percent), Germany (18 percent), and France (14 percent); not measurably different than the percentages in the United Kingdom (10 percent) and Italy (9 percent); and higher than the percentage in the Russian Federation (5 percent). A similar pattern was found with the lowest scores of the top 10 percent of students. That score was higher in Japan than in all other G-8 countries, except Germany (the scores for Japan and Germany were not measurably different) (figure 6-2). In the United States, the lowest score of the top 10 percent of students on the mathematics literacy scale was 607. This was a lower score than in Japan (648), Germany (638), Canada (638), and France 622; not measurably different than the scores in the United Kingdom (606) and Italy (602); and a higher score than in the Russian Federation (576). On the PISA 2009 science literacy scale, Japan had a higher percentage of students scoring above level 4 than all other G-8 countries (figure 6-1). In the United States, 9 percent of students scored above level 4. This was a lower percentage than in Japan (17 percent), Germany (13 percent), and Canada (12 percent); not measurably different than the percentages in the United Kingdom (11 percent) and France (8 percent); and a higher percentage than in Italy (6 percent) and the Russian Federation (4 percent). The same pattern was found with the lowest scores of the top 10 percent of students. That score was higher in Japan than in all other G-8 countries (figure 6-2). In the United States, the lowest score of the top 10 percent of students on the science literacy scale was 629. This was a lower score than in Japan (659), Germany (645), and Canada (642); not measurably different than the scores in the United Kingdom (640) and France (624); and a higher score than in Italy (609) and the Russian Federation (594).\nIn PISA 2009, reading literacy was the subject area assessed in depth; a smaller portion of the assessment was devoted to mathematics than in PISA 2003, when mathematics was the major subject area, and a smaller portion of the assessment was devoted to science than in PISA 2006, when science was the major subject area. For information about how reading literacy, mathematics literacy, and science literacy are defined in the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA), see the Definitions and Methodology section of indicator 8. In PISA 2009, scores are reported on a scale from 0 to 1,000. In reading literacy, the average score across OECD countries is 493 with a standard deviation of 93. In mathematics literacy, the average score across OECD countries is 496 with a standard deviation of 92. In science literacy, the average score across OECD countries is 501 with a standard deviation of 94. Proficiency in reading, mathematics, and science literacy in PISA was defined in terms of levels based on student performance scores on each scale. Proficiency above level 4 (i.e., at level 5 or 6) is defined by scoring 625.61 and above in reading, 606.99 and above in mathematics, and 633.33 and above in science. See OECD 2010c for a complete description of each PISA proficiency level in each subject area. In PISA, \"15-year-olds\" refers to students who are between 15 years and 3 months old and 16 years and 2 months old at the time of the assessment and who have completed at least 6 years of formal schooling.   In the United States, 18 percent of 15-year-old students scored below PISA proficiency level 2 in science literacy, a higher percentage than in Canada (10 percent), Japan (11 percent), Germany (15 percent), and the United Kingdom (15 percent).\nIn PISA 2009, reading literacy was the subject area assessed in depth; a smaller portion of the assessment was devoted to mathematics than in PISA 2003, when mathematics was the major subject area, and a smaller portion of the assessment was devoted to science than in PISA 2006, when science was the major subject area.

In mathematics literacy, the average score across OECD countries is 496 with a standard deviation of 92. In science literacy, the average score across OECD countries is 501 with a standard deviation of 94. Proficiency in reading, mathematics, and science literacy in PISA was defined in terms of levels based on student performance scores on each scale. Proficiency below level 2 is defined by scoring below 407.47 in reading, below 420.07 in mathematics, and below 409.54 in science. See OECD 2010c for a complete description of each PISA proficiency level in each subject area. In PISA, \"15-year-olds\" refers to students who are between 15 years and 3 months old and 16 years and 2 months old at the time of the assessment and who have completed at least 6 years of formal schooling. \nThe Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) is an international assessment that measures the performance of 15-year-old students in reading literacy, mathematics literacy, and science literacy. PISA was first implemented in 2000 and is conducted every 3 years. Each PISA data collection effort assesses one of the three subject areas in depth (considered the major subject area), although all three are assessed in each cycle (the other two subjects are considered minor subject areas for that assessment year). Assessing all three areas allows participating countries to have an ongoing source of achievement data in every subject area while rotating one area as the main focus over the years. Reading was the major subject area in 2000 (and again in 2009), mathematics was the major subject area in 2003, and science was the major subject area in 2006. This sequencing provides a base for comparison with later results. For example, the mathematics reporting scale used for PISA in 2003 is directly comparable to the mathematics scales used in subsequent PISA assessments. PISA defines reading literacy as \"understanding, using, reflecting on and engaging with written texts, in order to achieve one's goals, to develop one's knowledge and potential, and to participate in society\" (OECD 2009, p. 23). Scores on the PISA 2000 reading literacy scale are reported on a scale from 0 to 1,000, with the OECD average established at 500 and the standard deviation established at 100 (as reading literacy in 2000 is the base for comparison with later results). Scores on the PISA 2009 reading literacy scale are reported on a scale from 0 to 1,000, with an average score across OECD countries of 493 and a standard deviation of 93. PISA defines mathematics literacy as \"an individual's capacity to identify and understand the role that mathematics plays in the world, to make well-founded judgments and to use and engage with mathematics in ways that meet the needs of that individual's life as a constructive, concerned and reflective citizen\" (OECD 2003, p. 24). Scores on the PISA 2003 mathematics literacy scale are reported on a scale from 0 to 1,000, with the OECD average established at 500 and the standard deviation established at 100 (as mathematics literacy in 2003 is the base for comparison with later results). Scores on the PISA 2009 mathematics literacy scale are reported on a scale from 0 to 1,000, with an average score across OECD countries of 496 and a standard deviation of 92. In PISA 2009, a smaller portion of the assessment was devoted to mathematics than in PISA 2003, when mathematics was the major subject area. PISA defines science literacy as \"an individual's scientific knowledge and use of that knowledge to identify questions, acquire new knowledge, explain scientific phenomena, and draw evidence-based conclusions about science-related issues; understanding of the characteristic features of science as a form of human knowledge and inquiry; awareness of how science and technology shape our material, intellectual, and cultural environments; and willingness to engage in science-related issues and with the ideas of science, as a reflective citizen\" (OECD 2006, p. 23). Scores on the PISA 2006 science literacy scale are reported on a scale from 0 to 1,000, with the OECD average established at 500 and the standard deviation established at 100 (as science literacy in 2006 is the base for comparison with later results). Scores on the PISA 2009 science literacy scale are reported on a scale from 0 to 1,000, with an average score across OECD countries of 501 and a standard deviation of 94. In PISA 2009, a smaller portion of the assessment was devoted to science than in PISA 2006, when science was the major subject area. In order to ensure that the measurement of performance by different surveys is fully comparable, some common assessment items are used in each survey. However, the limited number of such items increases the risk of measurement errors. Therefore, the confidence band for comparisons over time is wider than for single-year data, and apparent differences should be interpreted with caution. That is, normally when making comparisons between two concurrent means, the significance is indicated by calculating the ratio of the difference of the means to the standard error of the difference of the means. If the absolute value of this ratio is greater than 1.96, a true difference is indicated with 95 percent confidence. When comparing two means taken at different times, as in the different PISA surveys, an extra error term, known as the linking error, is introduced and the resulting statement of significant difference is more conservative. In PISA, \"15-year-olds\" refers to students who are between 15 years and 3 months old and 16 years and 2 months old at the time of the assessment and who have completed at least 6 years of formal schooling.  In both 2000 and 2009, 15-year-old females had higher scores, on average, than their male peers on the reading literacy scale in every G-8 country with data reported 10 (figure 9-1). In 2000, the male-female differences in score points on the reading literacy scale ranged from 29 points in the United States and France to 38 points in the Russian Federation and Italy. In 2009, the malefemale differences ranged from 25 points in the United States and the United Kingdom to 46 points in Italy. While the U.S. male-female difference in score points in 2000 did not differ measurably from that in any other G-8 country with data reported, in 2009 it was smaller than that in Italy, the Russian Federation, France, Germany, and Canada.\nThe Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) is an international assessment that measures the performance of 15-year-old students in reading literacy, mathematics literacy, and science literacy. PISA was first implemented in 2000 and is conducted every 3 years. Each PISA data collection effort assesses one of the three subject areas in depth (considered the major subject area), although all three are assessed in each cycle (the other two subjects are considered minor subject areas for that assessment year).

Reading was the major subject area in 2000 (and again in 2009), mathematics was the major subject area in 2003, and science was the major subject area in 2006. This sequencing provides a base for comparison with later results. For example, the mathematics reporting scale used for PISA in 2003 is directly comparable to the mathematics scales used in subsequent PISA assessments. For information about how reading literacy, mathematics literacy, and science literacy are defined in PISA and for more information about the reporting scales used in PISA and the measurement of change, see the Definitions and Methodology section of indicator 8. In PISA, \"15-year-olds\" refers to students who are between 15 years and 3 months old and 16 years and 2 months old at the time of the assessment and who have completed at least 6 years of formal schooling.\nAverage class size refers to the division of students who are following a common course of study, based on the highest number of common courses (usually compulsory studies), and excludes teaching in subgroups outside the regular classroom setting. In order to ensure comparability among countries, the data include only regular programs at the primary level of education; specialneeds programs have been excluded from the calculation. Data on average class size are not available for the education levels of preprimary, lower and upper secondary combined, and higher education, and thus are not shown in this indicator as is done for the ratio of students to teaching staff. The ratio of students to teaching staff is calculated by dividing the number of full-time-equivalent students at a given level of education by the number of full-time-equivalent teachers at that level. Teaching staff refers to professional personnel directly involved in teaching students. This includes classroom teachers; special education teachers; and other teachers who work with a whole class of students in a classroom, in small groups in a resource room, or in one-to-one teaching situations inside or outside a regular classroom. Teaching staff also includes department chairpersons whose duties include some teaching, but excludes paraprofessional personnel who support teachers in providing instruction to students, such as teacher aides. As shown in the figures, education levels are defined according to the 1997 International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED97). For more information on the ISCED97 levels, see appendix A.   Secondary 8 Higher education 9 Preprimary 6\nIn PISA, \"15-year-olds\" refers to students who are between 15 years and 3 months old and 16 years and 2 months old at the at the time of the assessment and who have completed at least 6 years of formal schooling. The computations presented in the text and in table 12-1 were carried out using unrounded numbers; therefore, they may differ from computations made using the rounded numbers that appear in figure 12-1.   PISA asked school principals if the assessment results of 15-year-old students are used at their schools for various purposes: inform parents about their child's progress, make decisions about students' retention or promotion, group students for instructional purposes, compare school's performance to district-or national-level performance, monitor the school's progress from year to year, and make judgments about teachers' effectiveness. Using data from the 2000 and 2009 PISA assessment, this indicator presents information on the extent to which students in the G-8 countries attended schools that use assessment results for each of these purposes. 15 Almost all students in the G-8 countries attended schools that use assessments to inform parents about their child's progress ( figure 13-1). Across the G-8 countries with data reported 16 in 2000 and 2009, at least 97 percent of 15-year-olds attended schools whose principals reported that assessments are used to inform parents about their child's progress. Most students in the G-8 countries attended schools that use assessment results to make decisions about students' retention or promotion. Across the G-8 countries with data reported in 2000 and 2009, at least 70 percent of 15-year-olds attended schools whose principals reported using assessment results to make decisions about students' retention or promotion. In the United States, the percentage in 2009 was lower than the corresponding percentages in Italy, Japan, Canada, the Russian Federation, and Germany-70 percent in the United States compared to a range from 87 to 97 percent. In Germany and Canada, the percentage was 3 and 4 percentage points lower, respectively, in 2009 than in 2000; in Italy, the percentage was 10 percentage points higher in 2009 than in 2000. The percentage of students who attended schools that use assessment results to group students for instructional purposes varied widely across the G-8 countries with data reported. In 2000, the percentage was higher in Canada (77 percent) than in all other G-8 countries (ranging from 10 percent in Italy to 63 percent in the United States). In 2009, the percentage was higher in the United Kingdom (95 percent) than in all other G-8 countries (ranging from 34 percent in Germany to 76 percent in Canada). In the United States, the corresponding percentages were 63 and 69 percent in 2000 and 2009, respectively. In Japan and Italy, the percentage of 15-year-olds whose principals reported using assessment results to group students for instructional purposes was 13 and 54 percentage points higher, respectively, in 2009 than in 2000. Among the G-8 countries reporting data in 2000 and 2009, the United States, with one exception, had the highest percentage of students who attended schools that use assessment results to compare the school's performance to district-or national-level performance (92 percent in 2000 and 95 percent in 2009). The one exception was that there was no measurable difference between the percentages for the United States and the United Kingdom in 2009. In Japan, Germany, and Italy, no more than about one-third of 15-year-olds in 2000 and 2009 attended schools whose principals reported that assessment results are used to compare their school's performance to district-or national-level performance. In Japan, the percentage was 13 percentage points higher in 2009 than in 2000; the percentage was 14 percentage points higher in Italy, 22 percentage points higher in Germany, and 29 percentage points higher in Canada in 2009 than in 2000. In 2000 and 2009, the percentage of students who attended schools that use assessment results to monitor their school's progress from year to year was higher in the United States than in most other G-8 countries. In 2000, the U.S. percentage (93 percent) was higher than the percentages in all other G-8 countries with data reported except the Russian Federation (the percentages in the United States and the Russian Federation were not measurably different). In 2009, the U.S. percentage (98 percent) was higher than the percentages in all other G-8 countries with data reported except the Russian Federation and the United Kingdom (the percentage in the United States did not differ measurably from the percentages in these countries). In Germany, Japan, and Italy, about one-half to three-fourths of 15-year-olds in 2000 and 2009 attended schools whose principals reported that assessment results are used to monitor their school's progress from year to year. The percentage was 12 percentage points higher in the Russian Federation and 19 percentage points higher in Canada in 2009 than in 2000. The percentage of students who attended schools that use assessment results to make judgments about teachers' effectiveness varied widely across the G-8 countries. In 2000 and 2009, the percentage was higher in the Russian Federation (99 percent in 2000 and 98 percent in 2009) than in all other G-8 countries with data reported (ranging from 8 percent in France to 86 percent in Italy in 2000 and from 20 percent in Italy to 83 percent in the United Kingdom in 2009). In Germany, the percentage of 15-year-olds whose principals reported using assessment results to make judgments about teachers' effectiveness was 9 percentage points higher in 2009 than in 2000, while in Italy, the percentage was 65 percentage points lower in 2009 than in 2000.\nData for this indicator are from the PISA 2000 and 2009 school questionnaires, which were designed to obtain information about a variety of school-related aspects, including school characteristics, the school's resources, the student body, teachers in the school, pedagogical practices of the school, and administrative structures within the school. At all schools with participating 15-year-old students, a school questionnaire was administered to the principal. It should be noted that the PISA 2000 and 2009 principals do not constitute representative samples of principals. Rather, they are the principals for nationally representative samples of 15-year-old students. Thus, the school data presented in this indicator were analyzed at the student level. In PISA, \"15-year-olds\" refers to students who are between 15 years and 3 months old and 16 years and 2 months old at the time of the assessment and who have completed at least 6 years of formal schooling.  This indicator presents a cross-country comparison of the average annual salaries of full-time public school teachers with the minimum training necessary to be fully qualified at the beginning of their teaching careers. Comparisons are presented across two education levels: primary and upper secondary. The indicator also compares the ratio of these average starting salaries to the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita for each of the reporting countries.\nTeacher salary data are from the 2009 OECD Indicators of National Education Systems (INES) Survey on Teachers and the Curriculum and refer to the school year 2007-08. Data for GDP per capita are for calendar year 2008. Dollar figures for teacher salaries and GDP per capita were converted to U.S. equivalent dollars using purchasing power parities (PPPs), which equalize the purchasing power of different currencies. PPP exchange rate data are from the 2007-08 OECD National Accounts Database (OECD 2010b). Using PPPs to convert all teacher salary data to U.S. equivalent dollars allows for cost of living differences across countries to be taken into account. Salaries refer to scheduled salaries according to official pay scales, and are defined as before-tax, or gross, salaries (the total sum paid by the employer for the labor supplied), excluding the employer's contribution to social security and pension (according to existing salary scales). In addition, differences by country in taxation and social benefit systems as well as the use of financial incentives (including regional allowances for teaching in remote regions, family allowances, reduced rates on public transport, tax allowances on purchases of cultural goods, and other entitlements that contribute to a teacher's basic income) make it important to exercise caution in interpreting comparisons of teachers' salaries. Countries with centralized systems of education typically have national salary schedules. In countries like the United States, with decentralized education systems, local or regional governments establish their own salary schedules. The national averages shown here do not represent the within-country variation that exists in teacher salaries. The minimum training necessary to be fully qualified varies by country.

NOTE: Average starting salary refers to the average scheduled annual salary of a full-time teacher with the minimum training necessary to be fully qualified at the beginning of the teaching career.

Expenditures on core education services are the remaining expenditures net of the expenditures on ancillary services and research and development. Ancillary services are services provided by education institutions that are peripheral to the main educational mission. At the primary, secondary, and postsecondary nontertiary levels, ancillary services include meals, school health services, and transportation to and from school. At the higher education level, these services include residence halls (dormitories), dining halls, and health care. Ancillary services also include services for the general public such as museums, radio and In all G-8 countries with data reported except the United Kingdom and the United States, the percentage of GDP spent on education at the combined primary and secondary education levels was higher in 1995 than in 2007. This indicator begins by examining public and private education expenditures per student across the G-8 countries in 2007, including total education expenditures as well as the portion of total expenditures devoted to core services. Total expenditures are the combined expenditures for core and ancillary services, and also including research and development activities in higher education. Expenditures on core services pertain to spending on instructional services, including faculty/staff salaries, professional development, and books and other school materials. Expenditures on ancillary services pertain to spending on education services other than instruction, such as meals at school, transportation to and from school, and campus housing. Using data from 1995 and 2007, this indicator also examines annual public and private education expenditures as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP), allowing a comparison of countries' education expenditures relative to their overall economic output. In 2007, the total expenditures per student and the portion of these expenditures devoted to core education services were higher in the United States than in all other G-8 countries with data reported at the combined primary and secondary education levels 18 and the higher education level ( figure 16-1). Annual expenditures per student on core education services in the United States were about $9,900 at the combined primary and secondary education levels and about $21,200 at the higher education level. In the other G-8 countries with data reported, annual expenditures per student on core education services ranged from about $7,000 in France and the United Kingdom to $7,600 in Canada at the combined primary and secondary levels and from about $5,200 in Italy to $13,600 in Canada at the higher education level. television broadcasting, sports, and recreational and cultural programs. Research and development includes research performed at universities or other higher education institutions, regardless of whether the research is financed from general institution funds or through separate grants or contracts from public or private sponsors. This category does not include research and development activities outside education institutions, such as research and development spending in industry.

The net graduation rate is calculated by dividing the number of graduates at each single year of age by the population at that age, and summing these over all the ages. The gross graduation rate is calculated by dividing the total number of graduates by the population at the typical age of graduation. At the upper secondary level, graduation rates in Canada, Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom are calculated from gross rates (with the graduation rates in Italy and the United States calculated from net rates). Typical graduation ages in these countries at this level of education vary depending on the specific program type and duration, with the age range as follows: Canada,[17][18]Germany,[19][20]Japan,[15][16][17]and the United Kingdom,[16][17][18]. At the level of academic higher education below the doctoral level, graduation rates in Canada, Japan, and the United States are calculated from gross rates (with the graduation rates in Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom calculated from net rates). Typical graduation ages in these countries at this level of education vary depending on the specific program type and duration, with the age range as follows: Canada,[22][23][24][25]Japan,[21][22][23][24]and the United States,[21][22][23][24] Mismatches between the coverage of the population data and the graduation data mean that the graduation rates for those countries that are net exporters of students may be underestimated and those that are net importers may be overestimated. As shown in the figures, education levels are defined according to the 1997 International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED97). For more information on the ISCED97 levels, see appendix A. Male-female percentage-point differences in graduation rates presented in the text were computed from unrounded numbers; therefore, they may differ from computations made using the rounded whole numbers that appear in the figures. 1 Reference year is 2007 rather than 2008.

Mismatches between the coverage of the population data and the graduation data mean that the graduation rates for those countries that are net exporters of students may be underestimated and those that are net importers may be overestimated.  In 2008, a greater percentage of 25-to 34-year-old females than males had completed higher education in every reporting G-8 country.

As shown in the figures, education levels are defined according to the 1997 International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED97). For more information on the ISCED97 levels, see appendix A. Individuals whose highest level of education is academic higher education have completed at least a first university degree program, which prepares students for advanced research and highly qualified professions. First university degree programs vary in duration in different countries in different programs of study. In the United States, the first university degree corresponds to a bachelor's degree; it excludes associate's degrees. Percentage-point differences presented in the text were computed from unrounded numbers; therefore, they may differ from computations made using the rounded whole numbers that appear in the figures. Among U.S. 25-to 64-year-olds whose highest level of attainment was upper secondary education, 38 percent earned more than the country's median income in 2008, lower than in all other reporting G-8 countries. Among U.S. adults who had completed academic higher education, 69 percent earned more than the median income in 2008; the corresponding percentages in the other G-8 countries ranged from 67 percent in Canada to 76 percent in France.

In the United Kingdom and Japan, the percentage of 3-to 4-year-olds enrolled in preprimary education programs was 95 and 86 percent, respectively. The United States had the lowest rate of enrollment of 3-to 4-year-olds (47 percent) of the six G-8 countries reporting data (figure 2-1). In 2008, the United States and the other reporting G-8 countries, with one exception, had nearly universal school participation of children ages 5-14 (the age group that typically corresponds with primary and lower secondary education) (table 2-1). The exception to the nearly universal enrollment of children in this age group was in the Russian Federation, where 94 percent of 5-to 14-year-olds were enrolled in formal education programs. The United States had an enrollment rate of 81 percent in 2008 for youth ages 15-19-the age group that corresponds most closely with upper secondary education. In the other G-8 countries reporting data, the percentage of 15-to 19-year-olds enrolled in formal education programs ranged from 73 percent in the United Kingdom to 89 percent in Germany. Compulsory education ends at age 18 in Germany; 17 in the United States; 16 in France, Italy, and the United Kingdom; and 15 in Japan (figure 2-1). 7 While participation rates were at 90 percent or higher through the end of compulsory education in France, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom, they fell below this level in Germany and the United States. Enrollment rates for 20-to 29-year-olds-the age group that corresponds most closely to the typical age of enrollment in higher education-were less than 30 percent among the seven G-8 countries reporting data (table 2-1).

The U.S. rate was lower than the rates in Germany (28 percent) and Canada (25 percent), but higher than the rates in Italy (21 percent), the Russian Federation (20 percent), France (19 percent), and the United Kingdom (17 percent). While the age groups used in the above discussion are consistent with those used in the published international report (OECD 2010a), other age groups are more closely aligned with the U.S. education system. Thus, results are presented below for the following three age groups that are also shown in table 2-1: ages 15-17, 18-22, and 23-29. For youth ages 15-17-the age group that corresponds most closely with upper secondary school in the United States-enrollment rates in 2008 across the G-8 countries were above 90 percent for all countries, except the United Kingdom (89 percent). In the United States, half of 18-to 22-year-olds-the age group that corresponds most closely to the typical age of enrollment in higher education in the United States-were enrolled in formal education programs. Enrollment rates for 18-to 22-year-olds ranged from 37 percent in the United Kingdom to 60 percent in Germany (data were unavailable for Japan). Enrollment rates for young adults ages 23-29 ranged from 10 percent in France to 20 percent in Germany, with the United States at 15 percent (data were unavailable for Japan).

PISA reports the percentage of students in each country reaching several proficiency levels describing the kinds of skills students demonstrated in the PISA assessment. For each subject area, PISA describes six proficiency levels ranging from the most advanced at level 6 to the lowest at level 1. An additional category (below level 1) includes students whose skills are not developed sufficiently to be described by PISA. This indicator reports the percentage of 15-year-olds who performed below PISA level 2 in each of the three subject areas. Level 2 has been established as a baseline level of proficiency on the PISA scale, at which students begin to demonstrate competencies in reading, mathematics, and science literacy that will enable them to participate effectively and productively in life (OECD 2010c). For example, in science literacy, students below level 2, at best, have limited scientific knowledge that can only be applied to a few familiar situations and can present scientific explanations that are obvious and follow explicitly from given evidence (see OECD 2010c for a complete description of each PISA proficiency level in each subject area).

In 2009, the percentage of 15-year-old students with an immigrant background was highest in Canada (24 percent), followed by the United States (19 percent) and Germany (18 percent) ( figure 10-1). In half of the G-8 countries, a larger percentage of students in 2009 than in 2000 reported an immigrant background: the Russian Federation (8 percentage points higher in 2009), the United States (6 percentage points), Italy (5 percentage points), and Canada (4 percentage points). In all G-8 countries except Canada (and Japan, which had too few sampled immigrants to report a comparison), 15-year-old students with an immigrant background scored lower, on average, on the PISA 2009 reading literacy scale than their native peers (figure 10-2). Excluding Canada (where scores were not measurably different) and Japan, score differences in 2009 ranged from 22 points in the United States to 72 points in Italy. A similar pattern occurred in 2000: Fifteen-year-old students with an immigrant background scored lower, on average, on the PISA 2000 reading literacy scale than their native peers in every G-8 country except the Russian Federation (with no measurable difference) and Japan (too few immigrant students sampled to compare). 12 In Germany, the difference in reading performance between students with an immigrant background and their native peers was smaller in 2009 than in 2000 (by 28 score points), while in Italy the gap in performance was larger in 2009 than in 2000 (by 33 score points).

In 2008, two countries had an average class size of less than 20 students-the Russian Federation (16 students) and Italy (19 students). Four countries had an average class size between 20 and 25 students-Germany, with 22 students; France and the United States, both with 23 students; and the United Kingdom, with 25 students. Japan had the largest average class size in primary education, with 28 students. Figure 11-2 shows the ratio of students to teaching staff for the G-8 countries, broken down by four levels of education: preprimary, primary, secondary (lower and upper secondary combined), and higher education. The ratio of students to teaching staff (called student/teacher ratio, below) accounts for teaching staff in addition to regular classroom teachers, such as special education teachers, resource teachers, or other specialized teachers. In the United States, student/teacher ratios were fairly consistent across education levels. In other countries, such as Japan, ratios tended to be higher at the lower education levels, but lower at the higher levels. On the other hand, in Italy, lower ratios were observed at the lower education levels, with a sharp increase at the higher education level. Specifically, in 2008, the U.S. student/teacher ratio at the preprimary level was 13 students per teacher, which was higher than the corresponding ratio in Italy (11), but lower than the ratios in France (19), the United Kingdom (18), Japan 17, and Germany (14). 13 At the primary level, the student/teacher ratio in the United States was 14 students per teacher, which was higher than the corresponding ratio in Italy (11), but lower than the ratios in the other G-8 countries (ranging from 17 to 20). At the secondary level, student/teacher ratios ranged from 9 students per teacher in the Russian Federation to 15 students per teacher in the United States and Germany.

Using data from PISA 2000 and 2009, this analysis compares male and female students who reported not spending any time reading for enjoyment with those who reported spending at least some time reading for enjoyment. One way to look at these data is to compare the percentage of students in each country who reported reading for enjoyment by sex and year. In both 2000 and 2009, the percentage of 15-year-old males and females in the Russian Federation who reported reading for enjoyment-75 and 86 percent, respectively, in 2000, and 71 and 87 percent, respectively, in 2009-was higher than that of their male and female counterparts in all other G-8 countries with data reported 14 ( figure 12-1). Among males in the G-8 countries, the percentage of students who reported reading for enjoyment was lowest in Japan and Germany in 2000 (45 percent in both countries) and lowest in Germany and the United States in 2009 (45 and 47 percent, respectively). Among females in the G-8 countries, the percentage of students who reported reading for enjoyment was lowest in Japan in both 2000 and 2009 (45 and 58 percent, respectively).

First university degree programs vary in duration in different countries in different programs of study. In the United States, this corresponds to a bachelor's degree but excludes associate's degrees. This indicator compares the percentage of first degrees awarded in four major fields of study: social sciences, business, and law; science, mathematics, and engineering; the arts and humanities; and education. In 2008, a greater percentage of first university degrees were awarded in the field of social sciences, business, and law than in any other field in all G-8 countries except Germany ( figure 19-1). Twenty-seven percent of first university degrees in Germany were awarded in the combined field of social sciences, business, and law; in the other G-8 countries, from one-third to one-half of first university degrees were awarded in this field. In science, mathematics, and engineering-related fields, the United States awarded the lowest percentages of first university degrees of all the G-8 countries. Fifteen percent of first university degrees in the United States were awarded in science, mathematics, and engineering-related fields. In the other G-8 countries, the percentages ranged from 22 percent in Canada and Italy to 29 percent in Germany.

In the United States, 89 percent of males and 79 percent of females who had completed academic higher education were employed. In most of the reporting G-8 countries in 2008, the gap in the employment rate between males and females was smallest among adults who had completed academic higher education and largest among those who had completed only lower secondary education. In all reporting G-8 countries, the male-female gap for lower secondary education or below was approximately two to four times the size of the gap for academic higher education. Italy had the largest male-female gap at the level of lower secondary education or below (37 percentage points). Japan had the largest male-female gap (26 percentage points) at the levels of upper secondary education 23 and academic higher education. In the United States, the male-female gap was 23, 12, and 10 percentage points among adults whose highest educational attainment was lower secondary education or below, upper secondary education, and academic higher education, respectively."}, {"section_title": "DISTRIBUTION OF POPULATION BY EDUCATION AND INCOME", "text": "This indicator compares the 2008 income distributions of adults ages 25 to 64 at three different levels of educational attainment: lower secondary education or below, upper secondary education, 24 and academic higher education. Income comparisons are made relative to each country's respective median income. For instance, in 2008, the median annual income in the United States for people age 15 and older was about $31,000 (U.S. Census Bureau 2009); those earning more than two times the U.S. median income would have had an average annual income of over $62,000, and those earning at or below half of the U.S. median income would have had an average annual income of $15,500 or less. As shown in this indicator, in all reporting G-8 countries, adults with a higher level of education tended to earn more than those with a lower level of education. Among U.S. 25-to 64-year-olds whose highest level of educational attainment was lower secondary education or below, 16 percent earned more than the median income in 2008; this percentage was lower than that in any other reporting G-8 country, with percentages ranging from 21 percent in the United Kingdom to 40 percent in Germany (figure 21-1). Two percent of U.S. adults with this level of education earned more than two times the median income; the corresponding percentages in the other G-8 countries ranged from 1 percent in the United Kingdom to 7 percent in Italy and Canada (table 21-1). In contrast, 44 percent of U.S. adults with a lower secondary education or below earned at or below half of the median income, which was higher than in any other reporting G-8 country, with percentages ranging from 18 percent in France and Italy to 39 percent in Canada. Among U.S. 25-to 64-year-olds whose highest level of educational attainment was upper secondary education, 38 percent earned more than the median income in 2008; this percentage was lower than that in any other reporting G-8 country, with percentages ranging from 41 percent in the United Kingdom to 56 percent in Italy (figure 21-1). (Only in Italy did more than half of the adults with this level of education earn more than the median income.)

The charts are not intended to show all possible pathways that a student can take or the many configurations of grades that may be found within the same school. Rather, each chart is intended to provide a general description that is useful for comparison across the G-8 countries. The colors on each chart correspond to ISCED97 levels (see next section). The ISCED97 term for each level of education is written within each block. The terms in italics in each block are a country's designation for that particular level (e.g., high school for upper secondary school). The left side of each chart is labeled with the typical ages corresponding to each level of education. The age labels represent the typical age at which a student begins the corresponding year of schooling; often, students are 1 year older at the end of the school year. Ages in bold text are the ages at which enrollment is universal, defined here as an enrollment rate of more than 90 percent. The rectangular box encasing some ages represents the range of ages at which enrollment is compulsory, or required by law. (See also indicator 2 for information on the age range at which more than 90 percent of the population is enrolled in formal education and the ending age of compulsory education.) The expected duration of a first university degree program, a bachelor's degree program in the United States, is listed in the note below each chart. On the right side of each chart are the years of schooling (\"grade,\" in the United States) corresponding to each level of education. The first year of schooling corresponds to the first year of compulsory education. The ages and years listed assume normal progress through the education system."}, {"section_title": "ISCED97 levels", "text": "The ISCED97 is a classification framework that allows for the alignment of the content of education systems using multiple classification criteria. The ISCED97 levels address the intent (e.g., to study basic subjects or prepare students for university) of each year of a particular education system, but do not indicate the depth or rigor of study in that year. Thus, the ISCED97 is useful when comparing the age range of students in upper secondary schools across nations; however, it does not indicate whether the curriculum and standards are equivalent within the same year of schooling across nations. The ISCED97 allows researchers to compile statistics on education internationally. The ISCED97 levels are as follows: \u2022 ISCED97 level 0 is classified as preprimary education. This is defined as the initial stage of organized instruction, designed primarily to introduce very young children to a school-type environment. ISCED97 level 0 programs can either be center or school based. Preschool and kindergarten programs in the United States fall into the level 0 category, although kindergarten is typically considered an elementary grade in the United States. \u2022 ISCED97 level 1 consists of primary education, which usually lasts 4 to 6 years. ISCED97 level 1 typically begins between ages 5 and 7, and is the stage where students begin to study basic subjects, such as reading, writing, and mathematics. In the United States, elementary school (grades 1 through 6) is classified as level 1. \u2022 At ISCED97 level 2, or lower secondary education, students continue to learn the basic subjects taught in level 1, but this level is typically more subject specific than level 1 and may be taught by specialized teachers. ISCED97 level 2 usually lasts between 2 and 6 years, and begins around the age of 11. Middle school and junior high (grades 7 through 9) in the United States are classified as level 2. \u2022 At ISCED97 level 3, or upper secondary education, student coursework is generally subject specific and often taught by specialized teachers. Students often enter upper secondary education at the age of 15 or 16 and attend anywhere from 2 to 5 years. ISCED97 level 3 can prepare students for university, further schooling, or the labor force. Senior high school (grades 10 through 12) is considered level 3 in the United States. \u2022 ISCED97 level 4 programs consist of postsecondary nontertiary programs. Postsecondary nontertiary programs are primarily vocational and are taken after the completion of secondary school, though the content is not more advanced than the content of secondary school courses. Although not included in the charts, postsecondary nontertiary programs are described in the text. ISCED97 level 4 programs in the United States are often in the form of 1-year certificate programs. \u2022 Tertiary programs 1 are divided into ISCED97 levels 5A, 5B, and 6. ISCED97 level 5A refers to academic higher education below the doctoral level. Level 5A programs are intended to provide sufficient qualifications to gain entry into advanced research programs and professions with high skill requirements. The international classification includes programs of medium length that last less than 5 years and long programs that last 5 to 7 years. In the United States, bachelor's, master's, and first professional degree programs are classified as ISCED97 level 5A. ISCED97 level 5B refers to vocational higher education. Level 5B programs provide a higher level of career and technical education and are designed to prepare students for the labor market. In the international classification, these programs last 2 to 4 years. In the United States, associate's degree programs are classified at this level. ISCED97 level 6 refers to the doctoral level of academic higher education. Level 6 programs usually require the completion of a research thesis or dissertation."}, {"section_title": "Text format", "text": "The text accompanying each chart is meant to give the reader more detail on each country's education system.

However, most institutions and/or departments set their own admissions standards, often with more rigorous requirements."}, {"section_title": "Common degree programs:", "text": "\u2022 Pre-university programs: 2-year programs that students in Quebec are generally required to complete before they are eligible to attend university. \u2022 Certificate: 1-year programs offered at colleges, regional colleges, community colleges, institutes, and colleges of applied arts and technology (the name depends on the jurisdiction). These programs are vocational and are oriented toward preparing students for the labor force in semiprofessional and technical fields. \u2022 Diploma: 2-to 3-year programs offered at community colleges, regional colleges, etc. These programs are vocational and are oriented toward preparing students for the labor force in semiprofessional and technical fields. \u2022 Bachelor's degree: 3-to 4-year academic programs at a university college or university. (University bachelor's degree programs are usually 4 years, while university college programs can be 3 or 4 years.) \u2022 Master's degree: Graduate programs at a university requiring 1 to 2 years beyond the bachelor's degree. This degree is designed to prepare students for professional careers. \u2022 Doctorate: Academic graduate programs at a university requiring 3 to 5 years after the bachelor's degree. Doctoral programs prepare students for careers in research.\n\u2022 Accademia degrees: Fine arts, restoration, and music degrees. Accademia degrees have been divided into two cycles according to the recent reforms, the first one taking 3 years to complete and the second one taking 2 years to complete. The diploma accademico di primo livello is awarded after the first cycle, and the diploma accademico di secondo livello is awarded after the second cycle. \u2022 Laurea: A first-level university degree taking 3 years from university entry to complete. It is characterized by both theoretical and applied studies, similar to a bachelor's degree in the United States. \u2022 Laurea specialistica/magistrale: Graduate specialized degree requiring 2 years of university study after a first-level degree, similar to a master's degree in the United States. \u2022 Master universitario di primo livello: A professional graduate program requiring at least 1 year of study after obtaining a laurea. \u2022 Master universitario di secondo livello: A professional graduate program requiring at least 1 year of study after obtaining a laurea specialistica/magistrale. \u2022 Dottorato di ricerca: Doctoral degree program focusing on research and taken at a university. Typically requires 3 years of instruction after the laurea specialistica/magistrale. \u2022 Diploma di specializzazione: Doctoral degree program for a specialized professional degree, such as medicine or law. Typically requires 2-6 years after the laurea specialistica/ magistrale.\n\u2022 Nonuniversity-level diploma: Obtained from kolled\u017e (colleges) and technikum (technical colleges). These diplomas are in applied or vocational fields and require 2 years of study after secondary school. Students may be able to enter university-level institutions after completing this degree and transfer some or all credits toward a bakalavr. \u2022 Diploma o nepolnom vysshem obrazovanii (diploma of incomplete higher education): If students leave university after at least 2 years of study, they may ask for this diploma, which allows them to work in certain jobs that require some university experience but not a degree. \u2022 Bakalavr (bachelor's degree): Program requiring 4 years of university study. \u2022 Magistr (master's degree): Competitive 2-year program for students who have completed their bakalavr's degree. Most require a year of research and a thesis. \u2022 Diplom: This specialized diploma can be obtained either by completing 1 year of study beyond the bakalavr or by completing 5 to 6 years of continuous study after upper secondary school. \u2022 Kandidat nauk: Students who hold a diplom or magistr are eligible to apply for these programs, which typically last for 3 years and require students to carry out independent research and defend a dissertation in public. Equivalent of a doctorate in the United States. \u2022 Doktor nauk: This is the highest possible academic degree in the Russian Federation, for which there is no U.S. equivalent. This degree requires that a kandidat nauk gain reputation in his or her field of study, publish independent research, and have experience supervising undergraduates. A 3-year sabbatical is often taken to prepare research for the degree, although there is no specified length of time required to obtain it. The doktor nauk requires a public dissertation defense (in addition to the defense completed to obtain a kandidat nauk). \u2022 Universal enrollment: Yes \u2022 Compulsory: Yes \u2022 Entrance/exit criteria: No (except for grammar schools in England) (In Northern Ireland, the Department of Education no longer supports academic selection, however it is not prohibited and many schools continue to select pupils based on ability). NOTE: Although lower and upper secondary schools are typically combined in the United Kingdom, the first 3 years of secondary school are classified as lower secondary under the ISCED and are commonly referred to as \"key stage 3.\" Some areas have both grammar schools, which enroll children with higher achievement, and comprehensive schools, which enroll children with lower achievement. \u2022 Entrance/exit criteria: In order to obtain the General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE), students take a series of singlesubject examinations after the first 2 years of upper secondary school (at age 15/16). The General Certificate of Education (GCE) Advanced levels (A levels) and the GCE Advanced Subsidiary examinations (AS levels) are similar tests taken in the sixth form (described below). NOTE: After the first 2 years of upper secondary school, students take General Certificate of Secondary Education qualifications (GCSEs), typically at age 16. They then have the option of continuing school for 2 years, often called the sixth form. Some schools do not offer the sixth form, in which case students can transfer to a school with one, sixth form college (which is similar but in a separate school) or go to a further education college. Sixth forms usually offer General Certificate of Education Advanced level examinations (GCE A levels). An A level qualification consists of advanced subsidiary (AS) and A2 units. The AS (taken at age 17) is a stand-alone qualification and is worth half a full A level qualification. The A2 (taken at age 18) is the second half of a full A level qualification and covers more demanding material than at AS level. An increasing range of GCSEs, A levels, and AS levels in applied (vocational) subjects is also being offered, along with a developing range of 14-19 Diplomas. Such 14-19 Diplomas involve part-time or full-time programs that combine vocational and academic studies in broad subject areas. They are suitable for 16-to 19-year-old adult learners or upper secondary students. GCE A levels are usually required for entry to higher education, however students are increasingly able to enter higher education with these parallel A level, AS level, and 14-19 Diploma vocational qualifications. If students choose not to enter sixth form, their options are the labor force (often through apprenticeships or youth training courses) or a further education sector college. Further education sector colleges have traditionally offered vocational courses, but increasingly have academic programs. Common degree programs: \u2022 Certificates of higher education: 1-year vocational courses. \u2022 Higher Education Diploma: Short undergraduate programs, which vary in length, offered at colleges and universities. (Not to be confused with the 14-19 Diplomas which are being introduced at the upper secondary level.) \u2022 Foundation degree: Employment-related higher education qualification taking 2 years to complete and offered at colleges and universities. \u2022 Bachelor's degree: 3-to 4-year academic programs at colleges or universities. Most students are on the honors degree track, the requirements of which are specific to schools and departments. Honors degrees are an entrance requirement for most graduate programs. \u2022 Advanced short degree: Short programs, which vary in length, for students who have already acquired a bachelor's degree, for example, the postgraduate certificate of education. Courses offered are often professional development-oriented. \u2022 Master's degree: A taught or research postgraduate degree offered at colleges and universities. One year or more beyond an honors bachelor's degree. NOTE: Ages represent the typical age at the beginning of the school year. Numbers in bold print indicate ages of universal enrollment (i.e., an enrollment rate of more than 90 percent). Numbers shaded represent the age at which compulsory enrollment begins through the age at which compulsory enrollment ends. In some countries, enrollment rates may fall below universal before the ending age of compulsory education. No meaning should be inferred from width of subdivisions.

NOTE: The education system in Scotland is different from that which exists in the rest of the United Kingdom. The Scottish Parliament is responsible for the overall supervision and development of the education system, while Scottish Government Education and Training has day-to-day responsibility for education, training, and life-long learning. Qualifications exams has been introduced for students in secondary schools, further education colleges, and training centers. At the end of upper secondary education, students generally take the examinations for the Scottish Qualifications Certificate (SQC) at Standard Grade or National Qualifications courses/units. These examinations are intended to be taken by the whole school population. Students who plan to go into higher education take the higher level examinations of the SQC. NOTE: During upper secondary school, students in Scotland have the option to continue in a traditional secondary school or to attend further education colleges. There are also nationally funded training and apprenticeship programs in which students can participate if they choose not to attend upper secondary school. Postsecondary and tertiary: The usual entry requirements for university are the higher or advanced higher level examinations of the SQC (see above). Further education colleges admit students who have just left school at age 16, students who have left school at age 17 or 18 with and without formal certification, and are now also admitting an increasing number of older students. Admission requirements at further education colleges are decided by the institution. Common degree programs: \u2022 Certificates of higher education: 1-year vocational courses. \u2022 Higher Education Diploma: Short undergraduate programs, which vary in length, offered at colleges and universities. \u2022 Bachelor's degree: Courses leading to an ordinary bachelor's degree last 3 years, while courses leading to a degree with honors are typically 4 years. There are also some courses where the first award is a master's degree. \u2022 Advanced short degree: Short programs, which vary in length, for students who have already acquired a bachelor's degree; for example, the postgraduate diploma of education. Courses offered are often professional development-oriented. \u2022 Master's degree: Taught master's degrees are typically 1-year programs, but research master's degrees are generally longer. Entrance into a master's program generally requires a bachelor's degree. \u2022 Professional degree programs: Advanced or extended programs leading to professional registration as a doctor, dentist, etc., that typically require 5 years beyond the bachelor's degree. \u2022 Doctorate: A doctorate generally requires 3 years of full-time study or 4 to 6 years if part time."}, {"section_title": "Sources:", "text": "Canadian Education Statistics Council. (2003).  \u2022 Entrance/exit criteria: Yes; brevet des coll\u00e8ges is the exit exam for lower secondary. It is a national examination, which determines whether or not students will be able to attend lyc\u00e9e. \u2022 Entrance/exit criteria: In order to enter upper secondary education, students must pass the brevet des coll\u00e8ges. Students take a national examination, the baccalaur\u00e9at, during the last year of secondary school, which determines entrance to university. NOTE: All three types of upper secondary school (enseignement professional, technologique, and g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) qualify a student to enter university, although certain tracks are more likely to lead to university: the academic branch (enseignement g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) typically leads to university and other forms of higher education; the technological branch (enseignement technologique) may also lead to specialized technological or professional forms of higher education; and the vocational branch (enseignement professional) more often leads to the labor force and/or job training. Common programs (short fields): \u2022 DUT (University degree in technology): Taken at the University Institute of Technology (IUT). Two-year program in mostly vocational subjects. Student may choose to continue on toward a license (see section below). \u2022 BTS (Higher technical diploma): Two-year program taken in higher education departments of lyc\u00e9es (STS, Institute for Higher Technical Studies); more specialized than degrees from IUT, but also in mostly vocational subjects. \u2022 DEUG (General university studies degree): Academic degree received after completion of 2 years of university. Common degree programs (long fields): \u2022 License: DEUG (see above) plus 1 additional year at university. \u2022 Ma\u00eetrise: Degree following the license. Requires 1 additional year at university. \u2022 DESS (Diploma of specialized higher studies): Follows the ma\u00eetrise; 1-year professional course involving a required internship. \u2022 DEA (Diploma of advanced studies): Follows the ma\u00eetrise; 1-year program designed to prepare students for doctoral research. Involves the preparation of a research project. \u2022 Medical doctor/dental/pharmacy: Degree programs taken at the university. Length of program varies and can lead to degrees such as the doctorat de m\u00e9decine specializ\u00e9, doctorat de m\u00e9decine generale, and doctorat pharmacie. \u2022 Doctorat: Research-based graduate degree program at a university, leading to a doctorate. Usually requires 5 years of study beyond the ma\u00eetrise. \u2022 Dipl\u00f4me grande \u00e9cole: Competitive degree programs (students must pass a selective entrance exam) in academic subjects, science, commerce, management, engineering, business, and architecture. These are typically 5-year programs and are taken at the grandes \u00e9coles. \u2022 Entrance/exit criteria: Based on a transition referral of the primary school. If parents disagree, in some L\u00e4nder, admissions tests determine if a student can take the education tracks of Realschule or Gymnasium. NOTE: There are different types of secondary schools, some combining Hauptschule and Realschule (for reporting purposes this type is referred to as Schule mit mehreren Bildungsg\u00e4ngen). The secondary school a student in Germany attends is determined by a combination of factors, depending on the L\u00e4nder: admissions tests, previous grade point average, teacher recommendations, and parents' wishes. The degree of flexibility that parents have in choosing which educational track their child enters also varies between L\u00e4nder. However, the type of school a student attends is sometimes less important than the chosen track: at the end of lower secondary, all students who meet the requirements receive a leaving certificate. At the Hauptschule it is generally the Hauptschulabschluss. In some L\u00e4nder, students who excel may receive a Qualifizierter Hauptschulabschluss at the end of grade 9. In some L\u00e4nder, students may obtain a Realschulabschluss on completing grade 10. (At the Realschule, students typically receive the Realschulabschluss (also called the Mittlere Schulabschluss), and at the Gesamtschule, both types of diplomas are offered). All students attending Gymnasium who advance to the upper secondary level automatically receive the Realschulabschluss. Some L\u00e4nder also have an orientation phase during the first 2 years of lower secondary school, which gives parents and teachers 2 more years to decide a child's educational path. In L\u00e4nder with a 6-year primary school, lower secondary school is 2 years shorter. Upper secondary: \u2022 Common name: \u00dcbergangssystem: 3-to 4-year vocational full-time instruction for young people who do not have a training contract, helping them to choose a career and providing them with vocational basic training or with an introduction to one or two occupational fields. It does not lead to a vocational school qualification. Berufsschule: 3-to 4-year vocational school, which regularly includes an apprenticeship; students at this school attend part time while also doing an apprenticeship. Berufsfachschule: 1-to 3-year full-time basic vocational school Fachoberschule: 2-year advanced vocational school  NOTE: The higher education system in Italy underwent a reform process in order to make it more compatible with the higher education systems of other European countries. Universities are now based on two main cycles (the 3-year foundation degree, or laurea, followed by a 2-year specialist degree, or laurea specialistica/ magistrale), with third-cycle degree options (dottorato di ricerca, diploma di specializzazione) that are similar to a doctorate in the United States. These changes were made to increase educational exchange between Italy and other European Union countries.\nThe Education System in Japan  \u2022 Entrance/exit criteria: Yes, students in Japan are placed into upper secondary schools based primarily on test scores and school report cards from lower secondary school. Scoring well influences students' chances of attending the most prestigious upper secondary schools in their area. NOTE: Juku refers to \"cram school\" or night school, which prepares students for upper secondary school entrance exams and/or gives students remedial lessons. Students may also choose to attend College of technology (Koutousenmongakkou), which combines years of upper secondary education with 2 years of higher education leading to the associate's degree. See below for details on Koutousenmongakkou. the students take an entrance examination offered by the National Center for University Entrance Examinations and an examination conducted by the university itself. For many universities, entrance examinations are very competitive. Common degree programs: \u2022 Jun-gakushi (at College of technology): 5-year programs for students to combine upper secondary education with vocational higher education. The first 3 years of these programs are spent at the upper secondary level and the last 2 earning a jun-gakushi (associate's degree). These programs are given at Koutousenmongakkou, in subjects like public works, mechanical engineering, and information technology. \u2022 Jun-gakushi (at junior college): Programs normally requiring 2 years of study, taken at junior colleges (Tankidaigaku), that prepare students for a career in fields like home economics, humanities, education, and social science. Junior colleges have traditionally enrolled mostly women. \u2022 Gakushi: Academic degree normally requiring 4 years of study that is similar to a bachelor's degree. Given at a Daigaku (college or university).
