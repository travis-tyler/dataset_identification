As drug development and assessment programs move into the presymptomatic population, inclusion criteria become even more important. 3 Evidence of abnormal amyloid and/or neurodegeneration biomarkers increase the likelihood of developing AD from preclinical disease stage 3, 4 and are expected to significantly enrich the enrolled population of individuals who will likely progress to AD if left untreated. 5 Indeed, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has qualified both cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Ab1-42 and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measured hippocampal volume as enrichment biomarkers to enroll mild and moderate as well as predemented AD subjects in regulatory clinical trials (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/893622/ 2011 and EMA/CHMP/SAWP/809208/2011 qualification opinions, available at http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/ by searching the document library).\nIn addition, diagnostic biological markers may serve as surrogate outcome measures in clinical trials, 6 and could replace previously adopted clinical endpoints, which are limited by substantial measurement variation, low sensitivity to change during early disease, and long follow-up periods. 7 The adoption of biomarkers precisely measuring biological change may increase the statistical power, thus requiring fewer participants studied for shorter durations, and notably reducing the costs of the trials. 8 Previous studies suggested that F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) 9 and MRI biomarkers 10 could be used as effective outcome measures in clinical trials. Questions regarding which biomarkers are best to use, and how, are currently far from resolved, and the choice must take into consideration the type of therapeutic intervention, the clinical stage of AD, the time dependence of biomarker changes during disease progression, as well as biomarker costs and availability. 11 The aim of this study was to investigate and compare the performance and power of the best-established diagnostic biological markers as outcome measures for clinical trials in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and CSF or MRI biomarker evidence of AD, using longitudinal data available in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data set."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects", "text": "Patients enrolled and data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the ADNI database (adni.loni.usc.edu).

For each MCI patient group and follow-up time set, scaled slopes were estimated, and biomarkers were ranked accordingly. With the Bayesian method, we are able to quantify uncertainty in the ranking through its estimated probability and to compare scaled slopes across biomarkers To compare biomarker performance across different follow-up times, a Bayesian power analysis was performed to find the optimal sample size needed in a hypothetical clinical trial to detect 20% reduction in the slope for a = 0.05.\nAll statistical analyses were performed using R software, 23 version 2.14.1.

All MCI patients had baseline clinical data and FDG-PET biomarkers; all but 9 MCI ABETA + patients had baseline MRI biomarkers. Most of the patients included in the study underwent 6-month follow-up visits with biomarker assessment up to 24 months after baseline. Clinical features and diagnostic biological markers available at different time points in the 2 MCI patient groups are shown in Table 1 . MCI ABETA + and HIPPO + patients were not different in any clinical feature and biomarker except for hippocampal volume, MCI HIPPO + patients showing significantly smaller volumes at any time point (P < 0.001). Table 2 shows biomarkers effect size (scaled slope) and provides biomarker ranking for each follow-up time set and MCI group along with the estimated probability of the ranking. MR biomarkers showed highest performance for all time sets and both MCI patient groups, followed by the other markers of neurodegeneration and, last, Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-COG). KN-BSI and hippocampal volume performance were comparable for all time sets and both MCI groups except for 18-month follow-up period (in ABETA + MCI patients only), when KN-BSI significantly outperformed hippocampal volume. ADAS-COG increased performance over longest (24 mo) follow-up periods (in ABETA + MCI patients only, showing significantly better ADAS-COG performance over 24 mo than HIPPO + MCI patients). Among FDG-PET biomarkers, HCI ranked first for all time sets except 6-month observations up to 2 years (HIPPO + MCI patients); metaROI ranked higher than logPALZ for shortest observation periods (12 and 18 mo) and lower than logPALZ for longest follow-up periods.\nEstimated probabilities that any biomarker had a larger slope in pairwise comparison with any other biomarker for each follow-up time set and both MCI groups are shown in Table e-2 (Supplemental Digital Content, http://links.lww.com/WAD/A106).

Biomarkers could be used in clinical trials with 2 different objectives: (i) to demonstrate target engagement (which is a necessary but not sufficient condition to drug clinical efficacy and is not addressed in the current study); or (ii) to work as surrogate clinical outcomes, demonstrating disease-modifying effect. We believe the latter to be the best condition in which current findings could be translated, keeping in mind that regulatory agencies have not yet recognized any biomarker as a surrogate clinical outcome measure although biomarkers can presently be used as secondary outcome measures in addition to a measure of clinical efficacy. Moreover, the current study is not aimed at identifying the best marker to be used as a surrogate outcome measure in all future clinical trials, but rather aims at providing information which could drive the choice of outcome measure, which still depends highly on the design of any particular trial.\nMRI and FDG-PET imaging outperformed clinical biomarkers, and MRI outperformed FDG-PET measures for all time sets and both MCI patient groups. Among MR biomarkers, KN-BSI, specifically designed as a longitudinal measure to track disease progression, outperformed hippocampal volume, especially among MCI patients screened to be positive for amyloid-b.\nThere are a number of previous studies focused on determining the effectiveness of different biomarkers as outcomes in MCI clinical trials by calculating sample size estimates based on ADNI data.\nTheir main limitation (all but 24 ) was based on tout-court MCI, rather than on enriched MCI patient groups. As both CSF Ab1-42 and hippocampal atrophy on MRI have been qualified as enrichment biomarkers to enroll predemented AD subjects in regulatory clinical trials (EMA/CHMP/ SAWP/893622/2011 and EMA/CHMP/SAWP/809208/2011 qualification opinions), all future clinical trials will be performed on enriched MCI groups, pointing out the need to have new reliable estimates. Despite use of different selection criteria, the biomarker ranking proposed in this study is in line with previous findings.

Restricting enrollment to MCI groups enriched based on CSF biomarkers or structural atrophy was shown to reduce sample size by one half. 24 Despite their overall consistent findings, previous studies found quite different sample size and power estimates due to different methodologies adopted. Moreover, they limited investigation to just a few biomarkers or a single duration of observation. The current study intended to move a step forward by comparing head-to-head the performance and power of the best-established diagnostic biological markers at a time, in 2 enriched MCI cohorts, over different time sets, using a simulation technique, thus providing pieces of information which could be useful to optimize future clinical trial design.\nWe found that for all biomarkers and both MCI groups the power increased with increasing duration of follow-up with the main differences observed for study durations of 12 to 18 months. These results are in line with a previous MR study showing that hippocampal atrophy power increases with time of observation. 25 We showed that the power did not significantly increase with 6-monthly biomarker assessment compared with yearly assessment; to our knowledge, no previous study investigated this aspect of study design.\nMR measures, beyond having highest estimated power for all follow-up time sets, showed a nonlinear power trend, reaching an early plateau. Conversely, most of the other biomarkers increased in power linearly with increasing sample size. This key finding suggests that, in case MR biomarkers are used as outcome measures, it is useless to increase sample size beyond a given threshold size, as it would result in a negligible increase in power.\nFrom a methodological point of view, there are a number of issues that deserve discussion. All of them were addressed in the pertinent section of the supplementary material (Supplemental Digital Content, http://links. lww.com/WAD/A106, section 2).\nThe current study has a number of limitations. First, biomarkers included in the study do not represent all potential outcome measures. They were chosen among the best-established biomarkers of AD progression, based on data availability in the ADNI longitudinal data set. Among FDG-PET biomarkers, 3 summary metrics of AD-like hypometabolism (logPALZ, HCI, and metaROI), previously shown to be sensitive measures of change in cognition in AD and MCI patients, [17] [18] [19] were included in the study. Unlike most other markers included in this analysis, logPALZ had originally been developed and validated in a completely independent sample. 16 Conclusions related to use of FDG-PET as a biomarker, therefore, are limited to the specific methods used for quantification. It would have been interesting to include in the study FDG-PET biomarkers specifically designed to track progression in MCI (such as empirically pre-defined statistical region of interest [sROI] measure 33 ), but this was not possible as only few data were available, especially at follow-up. Among structural MRI biomarkers, we chose to include hippocampal volume, previously shown to parallel and precede cognitive decline, 29, 34 and the KN-BSI measure of brain atrophy rate, T0-T6-T12-T18-T24  T0-T6-T12-T18  T0-T6-T12  T0-T12-T24 MCI 21 ; logPALZ, logtransformed PMOD Alzheimer score 16 ; MetaROI, FDG-PET summary metric based on meta-analitically derived regions of interest reflecting AD hypometabolism pattern 18 ; T0, baseline; Tn, n-month follow-up. a longitudinal measure (unlike hippocampal volume and all of the FDG-PET measures, which are cross-sectional in nature) specifically designed to optimally track disease progression. 22 Only automatically computed hippocampal volumes were considered as no manual tracing was available in the ADNI data set and semiautomated volumes were available only for a few time points. Among clinical markers we chose ADAS-COG, rather than other clinical scores known to be even more sensitive for the early stages of AD (eg, Clinical Dementia Rating scale \u00c0Sum of Boxes, CDR-SB), as the former is widely adopted as outcome measure in clinical trials.\nIt would have been interesting to consider a third MCI group, enriched based on amyloid imaging (which was recently qualified as enrichment biomarker to enroll predemented AD subjects in clinical trials, beyond CSF Ab 1-42 and hippocampal atrophy), but this was not possible due to paucity of data available (just around 20 ADNI subjects have baseline PIB data, and such a limited number would have resulted in unreliable findings; about 50 MCI patients have 12-mo PIB data, 34 of whom are PIB + , but considering 12-mo follow-up visit as baseline would have entailed to have limited follow-up information and would have biased the comparisons). Moreover, we could investigate an additional cohort represented by patients who have both CSF and MRI evidence of AD; despite a previous study showing significant advances to combining evidence for both biomarkers, 24 we chose not to include it in the study, as we are not aware of any clinical trial using >1 enrichment biomarker at a time.\nKN-BSI and hippocampal volume quality control information, albeit available, were not used, and data were included even in case of failure of the algorithm-specific quality control. Data derived from a failed run of the algorithm may be less reliable but, in contrast, if we used only data passing the algorithm-specific quality control, sample size estimates would need to be inflated to account for the percentage of scans that might fail. Retrospective checks revealed that all data used in the study passed KN-BSI quality control (data were rated at least as borderline acceptable); all baseline data passed Freesu rfer-based hippocampal volume quality control, whereas a limited number of follow-up data (about 12% HIPPO + and 22% ABETA + data) did not pass it.\nThe probabilities of the biomarker rankings proposed in this study seem low, but are still fairly high compared with the probabilities of chance (if all rankings were equally likely, the probability of a given ranking of the 6 biomarkers would be 0.001389).\nFinally, it has been recently pointed out that change in patients should be considered relative to change in healthy controls, rather than in absolute terms, to have reliable sample size estimates for treatments targeting amyloid-related pathology. 31 Even though we basically agree with this observation, as the annualized brain change in healthy controls were shown to be much lower than in MCI and AD patients, 35 we believe that such correction would negligibly modify sample size estimates over a limited time (2 y) period.\nIn conclusion, in the current study we provided evidence that imaging biomarkers indeed outperform clinical markers of AD progression, widely used in the past as outcome measures for clinical trials, and that MRI measures (especially KN-BSI measure of brain atrophy) are the most effective outcome measures in both ABETA + and HIPPO + MCI groups, even for short (12 mo) duration clinical trials and yearly observations. These findings provide information about the biomarker enrichment and outcome measures that could be employed to reduce MCI patient samples and treatment duration in future clinical trials, and could drive the choice of surrogate outcome measure with respect to the mechanism of action of the drug under trial. In contrast, the assessment of imaging biomarkers in clinical trials has a number of drawbacks which need to be taken into account, in terms of cost, availability, and required experience, and bring a number of unresolved issues regarding reliability and standardization over different centers. Future studies aimed at comparing feasibility and cost-effectiveness of the use of biomarkers in clinical trials and clinical practice are needed."}]
