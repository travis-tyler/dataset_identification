Timely surveys can also inform about the extent to which students and the U.S. population in general can access and use technology resources at school and in their homes and where gaps in opportunity remain. The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) has benefited from the strong support of the Department of Education' s Office of Educational Technology (OET) in designing and conducting the technology surveys featured in this issue of the Education Statistics Quarterly. Susan Patrick, the director of OET, provides the commentary for this issue. NCES began tracking the use of technology for instruction in schools in 1994, when it launched its annual Fast Response Survey System (FRSS) survey on Internet access. \"Internet Access in Public Schools,\" now in its 10th year, tracks progress made in connecting public schools and instructional rooms to the Internet, how public schools are connected to the Internet (broadband vs. narrowband), and the student-to-computer ratio. To keep up with advances in technology and Internet expansion, NCES has added questions to the survey to address emerging issues. These questions provide information on the technologies and procedures used to prevent student access to inappropriate material on the Internet, the availability of adaptive and assistive devices for students with disabilities, and access outside of regular school hours. Questions on topics such as platforms, memory, and disk space used on instructional computers; school web sites; schoolsponsored e-mail; and laptop computer loans also enable school officials to compare their own technology programs to others. NCES also tracks individual and household use of computers and the Internet. A number of different NCES surveys-the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002, the National Household Education Surveys Program, and the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Birth Cohort-contain items on this topic. The primary data collection that NCES uses to track changes in individual and household use of computers and the Internet, however, is the Current Population Survey (CPS). The first CPS collection on this topic was conducted in 1984. Since then, NCES and the U.S. Census Bureau (which fields the CPS) have worked with OET, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and other agencies to adjust the survey to reflect changes in technology over time. The most recent CPS collection on this topic was fielded in October 2003. It covered a wide range of related subjects including household computer ownership and Internet access, individual use of computers and the Internet for activities such as completing school and work projects, the locations where people use computers and the Internet, and the use of other information technologies. In addition to technology access in schools and homes, NCES has studied s classroom use of technology (using the Third International Mathematics and Science Study 1999 Video Study); N O T E FROM NCES s technology use in kindergarten and first grade; and s the use of distance learning and the range of offerings in postsecondary education. NCES also expects to release in fall 2004 a new FRSS survey that will examine the extent to which school districts offer distance education courses to public elementary and secondary students. Anecdotal evidence suggests that technology-based education at the elementary and secondary levels enables school districts to expand the range of courses available and facilitates more flexibility in student schedules and instructional delivery. To date, however, no nationally representative studies have examined the relationship among distance education availability, course offerings, and enrollments in the nation' s elementary and secondary schools. The new survey will provide for the first time s the number of schools and districts with students enrolled in distance education courses; s the number of enrollments in distance education courses by instructional level and curriculum area; s reported reasons for having distance education courses; s technologies used as the primary mode of instructional delivery for distance education courses; s information about entities that deliver distance education courses; s information about where students access online courses, and whether districts provide or pay for computers or Internet service providers for students accessing online courses at home; and s information about whether districts plan to expand distance education course offerings and to what extent various factors may be keeping them from doing so. Other NCES projects that relate to information and communications technology include the Technology-Rich Environments (TRE) pilot assessment, which is being conducted for the National Assessment of Educational Progress. The TRE assessment developed a set of example modules to use technology to assess student problem solving at the eighth grade. These example modules use the computer to present multimedia tasks that cannot be delivered through conventional paper-and-pencil assessments, but that tap important emerging skills. To date, NCES surveys have generated findings that have been valuable to states, school districts, and postsecondary institutions by helping them benchmark their own technology goals and needs against national averages and comparable systems. In addition, the Department of Education has used results from these surveys to report to Congress about the outcomes of various technology initiatives and programs and to plan its own strategic agenda for using technology in education. The popular press, the education press, researchers, and the public have followed the survey releases, as evidenced by the large and growing volume of downloads from the NCES web site of the reports documenting these releases. Each new release documents that Internet access has expanded the reach of our reports to a wider audience and the increasing interest in these reports.\nprograms below the baccalaureate level of less than 2 years' duration (less than 2 years), another 21 percent offered certificates requiring at least 2 but less than 4 years of study, and 1 percent offered certificates at the post-baccalaureate level or higher and are classified with the 4-years-and-above institutions. Further examination of the Title IV degree-granting institutions located in the United States indicates that 41 percent were public institutions, 40 percent were private not-forprofit institutions, and 19 percent were private for-profit institutions. Of the 2,186 non-degree-granting Title IV institutions located in the United States, 16 percent were public institutions, 12 percent were private not-for-profit institutions, and 73 percent were private for-profit institutions.\n\nBetween 1995 and 2000, no differences were detected in the overall proportion of institutions that offered at least one college-level remedial reading, writing, or mathematics course, although the proportion of institutions that offered remedial writing courses declined from 71 percent to 68 percent (table A). No differences were detected in the average number of different remedial reading, writing, or mathematics courses offered during this time period (table B).\ns In 1999-2000, the proportion of associate' s degrees earned by Blacks was greater than the proportion of bachelor' s degrees earned by Blacks. s Nearly one-quarter of all bachelor' s degrees earned by Blacks in 1999 were earned at historically Black colleges and universities. s The proportion of Blacks completing college increased between 1975 and 2000; however, Blacks still remained less likely than Whites to earn degrees (table A).  1984 1985 1986 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000   NOTE: The number of 11th-and 12th-grade AP test-takers is used as the numerator and the number of students enrolled in the 12th grade are used as the denominator to calculate the ratios presented here.

Two-thirds of Americans used computers in 2001, up from about onehalf in 1997, and 54 percent used the Internet, up from about a third in 1997. Comparable trend data have not been published for 5-to 17-year-olds, but among those ages 9 to 17, Internet use has increased from about one-third in 1997 to about two-thirds in 2001 (U.S. Department of Commerce 2002). In 2001, the use of these technologies was more widespread among children and adolescents ages 5 through 17 than among adults: about 90 percent of 5-to 17-yearolds used computers and 59 percent used the Internet in this year (table A). This report uses data from the September Computer and Internet Use supplement to the 2001 Current Population Survey (CPS) to examine the use of computers and the Internet by American children and adolescents between the ages of 5 and 17. 1 The report examines the overall rate of use, the ways in which children and teens use the technologies, where the use occurs (home, school, and other locations), and the relationships of these aspects of 1 CPS interviews were conducted in about 56,000 households in September 2001 and collected information regarding 28,002 5-to 17-year-olds, including those enrolled in school and those not enrolled in school. One respondent per household was interviewed and that respondent provided information about the household and about individual household members, including information about computer and Internet use. Because a household's respondent may not have full information regarding computer and Internet use by other members of the household, this method is a potential source of error in the data.  among Hispanics (table A). 2 Five-through 17-yearolds living with more highly educated parents are more likely to use these technologies than those living with less well educated parents, and those living in households with higher family incomes are more likely to use computers and the Internet than those living in lower income households. s Disability, urbanicity, and household type are factors in the digital divide. Consistent with the findings of previous research (U.S. Department of Commerce 2002), 5-through 17-year-olds without a disability are more likely to use computers and the Internet than their disabled peers, and children and adolescents living outside of central cities are more likely to use computers than those living in central cities.

However, when controlling for other factors such as family income and parent education, the association of household type and of Internet use outside of central cities was not statistically significant.\nSince 1969, the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) has been an ongoing nationally representative indicator of what American students know and can do in major academic subjects. Over the years, NAEP has measured students' achievement in many subjects, including reading, mathematics, science, writing, U.S. history, geography, civics, and the arts. In 2003, NAEP conducted a national and state assessment in mathematics at grades 4 and 8. NAEP is a project of the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) within the Institute of Education Sciences of the U.S. Department of Education, and is overseen by the National Assessment Governing Board (NAGB).\nSince 1969, the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) has been an ongoing nationally representative indicator of what American students know and can do in major academic subjects.

In 2003, NAEP conducted a national and state assessment in reading at grades 4 and 8. NAEP is a project of the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) within the Institute of Education Sciences of the U.S. Department of Education, and is overseen by the National Assessment Governing Board (NAGB). Beginning in 2002, the NAEP national sample was obtained by aggregating the samples from each state, rather than by obtaining an independently selected national sample. As a consequence, the size of the national sample increased, and smaller differences between years or between types of students were found to be statistically significant than would have been detected in previous assessments. In keeping with past practice, all statistically significant differences are indicated in the current report. The results presented in this report distinguish between two different reporting samples that reflect a change in administration procedures. The more recent results are based on administration procedures in which testing accommodations (e.g., extended time, small group testing) were permitted for students with disabilities (SD) and limited-English-proficient (LEP) students. Accommodations were not permitted in 1992 or 1994. Comparisons between results from 2003 and those from assessment years in which both types of administration procedures were used (in 1998 and 2000 at grade 4 and in 1998 at grade 8) are discussed based on the results when accommodations were permitted, even though significant differences in results when accommodations were not permitted may be noted in the figures and tables.\nThis  (Hoffman 2003). Approximately one in four public school students in the United States and jurisdictions is served by one of the 100 largest school districts (table A). These districts are distinguished from other school districts by characteristics other than the size of their membership, such as average and median school size, number of high school graduates, number of pupils receiving special education services, and minority enrollment as a proportion of total enrollment.  The universe for this table includes outlying areas, Bureau of Indian Affairs, and Department of Defense schools. The 500 largest school districts include 23 school districts that are some other configuration besides prekindergarten (PK)-or K-12, although all of the 100 largest school districts are PK-or K-12. 2 Includes high school diploma recipients as well as other high school completers (e.g., certificates of attendance). 3 Includes only schools where student membership was greater than zero. precede the basic tables in the full report and provide national data and data for the 100 and 500 largest school districts. Appendix A in the complete report lists the 500 largest school districts, with some identifying information. Appendix B is an alphabetical list of the 500 largest districts ranked by membership size. Appendix C provides a count of the number of 100 largest districts by state. Appendix D provides selected data for the 100 largest school districts in the 1991-92 school year for comparison. In all basic tables and appendixes, with the exception of appendixes B and C, districts are presented in decreasing order of membership size.\nThe \"School District Financial Survey\" (Form F-33) is an annual survey of school district financial data that is part of the Common Core of Data (CCD). The F-33 collects data on revenues and expenditures for prekindergarten through grade 12 in public schools in approximately 15,500 local education agencies (LEAs) in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. This report presents analyses of school district expenditures for the 1997-98 school year. The F-33 data form the core of these analyses, but information is supplemented by data on selected school district demographic and fiscal characteristics from the 1990 School District Data Book, prepared by the U.S. Census Bureau. * Analyses of school district expenditures are presented for the nation and the states. The national analyses focus on expenditures in school districts in different geographical regions, of different size, with different fiscal capacity to support education (measured by median household income and median housing value), with different proportions of minority enrollment and with different poverty rates. The state analyses focus on interdistrict variation in expenditures per pupil, and the relationship between expenditures per pupil and the school district fiscal and demographic characteristics cited in the national analyses. The analyses of expenditures presented in this report are based on both actual dollars and cost-adjusted dollars. Cost adjustments are designed to take into account differences in the cost of education across school districts in a state. The cost adjustment used in these analyses is the Geographic Cost of Education Index (GCEI), which uses school districts as the geographic area (Fowler and Monk 2001;Chambers 1998). The GCEI was developed using data from the 1993-94 Schools and Staffing Survey and works with\nThis report presents findings from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) winter 2001-02 data collection that included both race/gender information for staff employed in fall 2001 and salaries and fringe benefits of full-time instructional faculty 1 for academic year 2001-02. IPEDS also introduced a new component during the winter 2001-02 collection, Employees by Assigned Position. Response to this component was optional for the first year, so these data are not included in this report. The data included in this publication were collected through the IPEDS web-based data collection system. IPEDS collects data from postsecondary institutions in the United States (the 50 states and the District of Columbia) and its outlying areas. 2 IPEDS defines a postsecondary institution as an organization that is open to the public and has a primary mission of providing education or training beyond the high school level. This includes institutions that offer academic, vocational, and continuing professional education programs and excludes institutions that offer only avocational (leisure) and adult basic education programs. \nThis report presents findings from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) fall 2002 data collection, which included institutional characteristics data for the 2002-03 academic year and completions 1 data covering the period July 1, 2001, through June 30, 2002. These data were collected through the IPEDS webbased data collection system. Since 1985, IPEDS has collected data from postsecondary institutions in the United States (the 50 states and the District of Columbia) and its outlying areas. 2 For IPEDS, a postsecondary institution is defined as an organization that is open to the public and has as its primary mission the provision of postsecondary education. IPEDS defines postsecondary education as formal instructional programs with a curriculum designed primarily for students who are beyond the compulsory age for high school. This includes academic, vocational, and continuing professional education programs and excludes institutions that offer only avocational (leisure) and adult basic education programs. Participation in IPEDS was a requirement for the 6,508 institutions that participated in Title IV federal student financial aid programs such as Pell Grants or Stafford Loans during the 2002-03 academic year. 3 Title IV schools are a widely varied group of institutions that include traditional colleges and universities, 2-year institutions, schools of cosmetology, and for-profit degree-granting institutions, among others. In addition, the 80 central and system offices listed in the IPEDS universe are expected to provide minimal data through a shortened version of the Institutional Characteristics component. Institutions that do not participate in Title IV programs may participate in the IPEDS data collection on a voluntary basis. Tabulations in this report present selected data items collected from the 6,354 Title IV institutions in the United States and the 154 Title IV institutions in the outlying areas in fall 2002. Additional detailed information is available through the various IPEDS web tools. 4 Institutions provided institutional characteristics and price data for the 2002-03 academic year and completions data (degrees and other formal awards conferred) for the 2001-02 academic year. This report presents data for all Title IV institutions.\nEncouraging young adults to volunteer to serve their community is widely viewed as beneficial to the individual as well as to society. In volunteering, individuals can take responsibility for their community, learn to understand the conditions that other people face, and appreciate the value of community participation (Calabrese and Schumer 1986;Youniss, McLellan, and Yates 1997;Nolin et al. 1997;Smith 1999;Metz and Youniss 2003). Many schools and postsecondary institutions have established programs that promote, and in some cases require, student community service (Frase 1995;Nolin et al. 1997). Education administrators have emphasized student volunteerism by incorporating service experiences into classroom activities and graduation requirements (Kraft 1996;Skinner and Chapman 1999;Stukas, Snyder, and Clary 1999;Eyler 2002). Past research has found that students who participate in these programs tend to have stronger ties to school, peers, and the community, as well as a higher exhibition of other positive social behaviors (Nolin et al. 1997;Youniss, McLellan, and Yates 1997;Smith 1999;Metz and Youniss 2003). Given these potential benefits, it is important to understand the characteristics and patterns of volunteering among young adults. NELS:88 provides insight into community service from high school through young adulthood. Previous research using the NELS:88 1992 senior class found that 44 percent reported performing community service when asked about the past 2 years (1990-92) (Frase 1995). Females, Whites, Asians, and students from households of higher socioeconomic status were more likely to volunteer than other seniors. In the early 1990s, high school students were most often motivated to volunteer for \"strictly voluntary\" reasons (table 1). Thirty-eight percent said their participation was strictly voluntary compared to 17 percent who were strongly encouraged by someone else, 7 percent who were required for class, and 9 percent who were required for other reasons. 1 This Brief extends these cross-sectional findings about high school volunteering and examines the volunteering activities and patterns of the same 1992 senior cohort 2 years and 8 years after most cohort members had graduated from high school. The characteristics of young adult volunteers, their motivation for volunteering, and the types of organizations for which they volunteered may have important implications for their participation in community service later in life; encouraging early involvement with volunteer organizations may lead to an enduring habit of service (Smith 1999;Metz and Youniss 2003). By identifying the patterns of persistence and desistence in volunteering by young adults, a portrait of these initial, formative years is  1990-92, 1994, and 2000. Changes in the level of participation and type of volunteering are described over the 10-year period. Finally, the relationship between high school volunteering in 1990-92 and volunteering 8 years later, in 2000, is examined. Adults: 1990Adults: -2000 This section examines changes in volunteer service participation by young adults, as a group and individually, starting with their high school years in 1990-92, then in 1994, and again in 2000. Individual patterns of volunteer service onset, persistence, and desistence within these three survey periods are compared to the aggregate group patterns. Prevalence and change across these three time periods are examined by sex, race/ethnicity, and 1988 household SES.\nStatus and Trends in the Education of Blacks examines the mix of progress on key education indicators of Black children and adults in the United States. The report released by the National Center for Education Statistics shows that more Black students have completed high school and gone on to college, levels of parental education of Black children have increased, and the number of Black individuals and families below the poverty level has decreased. Despite these gains, progress has been uneven over time and across various measures, and differences persist between Blacks and Whites on key indicators of education performance. The following are highlights from the report.\nProjections of Education Statistics to 2013 is the 32nd report in a series begun in 1964. This report provides revisions of projections shown in Projections of Education Statistics to 2012 and Projections of Education Statistics to 2011 Hussar 2001, 2002). It includes statistics on elementary and secondary schools and degree-granting institutions. Included are projections of enrollment, graduates, teachers, and expenditures to the year 2013. In addition to projections at the national level, the report includes projections of public elementary and secondary school enrollment and public high school graduates to the year 2013 at the state level. These projections were produced by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) to provide researchers, policy analysts, and others with state-level projections developed using a consistent methodology. They are not intended to supplant detailed projections prepared in individual states."}, {"section_title": "Internet use Percent", "text": "s There are no differences between the sexes in overall computer or Internet use rates. In contrast to the 1990s, when boys were more likely to use computers and the Internet than girls were, overall computer and Internet use rates for boys and girls are now about the same (table A). s More children and adolescents use computers at school (81 percent) than at home (65 percent). The difference in school versus home computer use is larger for groups of 5-through 17-year-olds who are generally less likely to use computers. Computer use at school exceeds use at home by 30 percentage points or more for Blacks and Hispanics (table B). Use at school also exceeds use at home by 30 percentage points or more for those whose parents did not complete high school, who live with a single mother, who live in households where Spanish is the only language spoken by household members age 15 or over, or who live in households where the family income is under $20,000. However, home use is slightly more prevalent than school use for two groups: (1) children and adolescents whose parents have at least some graduate school education, and (2) children and adolescents who live in families with incomes of $75,000 or more per year. 4 s The use of home computers for playing games, to connect to the Internet, and for work on school assignments are common activities. A majority (59 percent) of 5-through 17-year-olds use home computers to play games, and over 40 percent use computers to connect to the Internet (46 percent) and to complete school assignments (44 percent).

(57-64 percent), to connect to the Internet (54-63 percent), and to play games (60-63 percent). s Home is the most common location for Internet access, followed by school. Although nearly all schools have Internet access, children and adolescents are more likely to access the Internet from their homes. Of those children and adolescents who use the Internet, 78 percent access it at home, compared to 68 percent who access it at school. Many of those who rely more on access at school come from lower income families (less than $35,000 per year) or have parents who have not earned at least a high school credential. s Many disadvantaged children and adolescents use the Internet only at school. Among the group of children and adolescents who access the Internet at only one location, 52 percent of those from families in poverty and 59 percent of those whose parents have not earned at least a high school credential do so at school. In comparison, 26 percent of those from families not in poverty and 39 percent of those with more highly educated parents do so only at school. This illustrates the role of schools in bridging the digital divide. s Considering all locations, the use of the Internet for work on school assignments, e-mail, and games are common activities. Among Internet users ages 5-17, about 72 percent (42 percent of all persons in this age range) use the Internet to complete school assignments, while 65 percent (38 percent of all persons in this age range) use the Internet for e-mail or instant messaging and 62 percent (36 percent of all persons in this age range) use it to play games.  Since 1994, the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) has surveyed public schools to estimate access to information technology in schools and classrooms. In the fall of each academic year, a new nationally representative sample of public schools is surveyed about Internet access and other Internet-related topics. The results of this survey-\"Internet Access in U.S. Public Schools, Fall 2002\"-show what progress has been made since these data were first collected in 1994, and help assess the magnitude of tasks remaining to make the Internet available as an educational tool in all schools. Although some items, such as those on school and classroom connectivity, have appeared annually on the survey, new items have been added as technology has changed and new issues have arisen. For example, an item on types of Internet connections was added in 1996 and has remained part of the subsequent surveys, with some modifications. The fall 2002 survey included items on access to the Internet outside of regular school hours; technologies and procedures used to prevent student access to inappropriate material on the Internet; school web sites; staff responsible for computer hardware, software, Internet, and web site support; loans of laptop computers to students; and provision of hand-held computers to students and teachers. This survey was conducted by NCES using the Fast Response Survey System (FRSS). FRSS is designed to administer short, focused, issue-oriented surveys that place minimal burden on respondents and have a quick turnaround from data collection to reporting. Questionnaires for this survey were mailed to a representative sample of 1,206 public schools in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Data have been weighted to yield national estimates. In addition to national estimates, selected survey findings are presented by the following school characteristics: s instructional level (elementary, secondary); s school size (enrollment of less than 300, 300 to 999, 1,000 or more); s locale (city, urban fringe, town, rural); s percent minority enrollment (less than 6 percent, 6 to 20 percent, 21 to 49 percent, 50 percent or more); and s percent of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch (less than 35 percent, 35 to 49 percent, 50 to 74 percent, 75 percent or more), which is used as a measure of poverty concentration at the school. It is important to note that many of the school characteristics used for independent analysis may also be related to each other. For example, enrollment size and instructional level of schools are related, with secondary schools typically being larger than elementary schools. Similarly, poverty concentration and minority enrollment are related, with schools with a higher minority enrollment also more likely to have a high concentration of poverty. Other relationships between analysis variables may exist. Because of the relatively small sample size used in this study, it is difficult to separate the independent associations these variables have with the data of interest. Their existence, however, should be considered in the interpretation of the data.\nFor example, although females are more likely than males to use computers at work, males use their computers at work in more varied ways than do females (analysis of Current Population Survey, September 2001, unpublished data). Females have also been found to have less positive attitudes toward computers than do males (Mitra, LaFrance, and McCullough 2001;Kadijevich 2000;Whitley 1997)."}, {"section_title": "Selected Findings", "text": "Key findings from the survey \"Internet Access in U.S. Public Schools, Fall 2002\" are presented below.

Participants who are not working participated in technology-based activities at a lower rate than all groups of working adults (39 vs. 47 percent or more), and those working in the trades participated at a lower rate than those in other occupation groups (47 vs. 53 and 62 percent). At the same time, education, occupation, and income groups traditionally overrepresented in postcompulsory education are overrepresented among participants who are in technology-based activities.

Participants with household incomes above $75,000 were more likely than those in all lower income groups to be in technology-based activities; 61 percent of those with household earnings above $75,000 were in these activities compared to 46 to 53 percent of those in other income categories.\nWhile public schools have made huge improvements in providing computer and Internet access, a disparity continues in minority and poor students' access to computers and the Internet at home. The good news is the significant progress that has been made in connecting nearly every school in the nation to the Internet. However, significant differences remain in home computer use by students of disparate socioeconomic backgrounds. The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB) supports enhancing education through technology and helps to support those students most in need. Approximately $2.1 billion has been appropriated for educational technology programs in the last 3 years under NCLB, a 50 percent increase from prior programs. Federal investments are being used to help schools access computers and the Internet. NCLB sets before the nation a challenge to ensure that all children will receive a quality education that prepares them for a 21st century America. The bottom line is unprecedented accountability to measure student progress. At the heart of this effort is a commitment to focus on students, equip teachers, empower parents, and inform decisionmakers to ensure every child receives the best possible education. Two recent reports from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) shed light on the progress that our nation has made in the last decade in technology access and highlight the role schools play in achieving parity in computer and Internet access for children and adolescents. Computer and Internet Use by Children and Adolescents in 2001 examines how children and adolescents from ages 5 through 17 access computers and the Internet, both at home and at school, using data from the 2001 Current Population Survey. Internet Access in U. S. Public Schools andClassrooms: 1994-2002 explores a series of trends in school use of technology over the past 9 years, using data from the NCES Fast Response Survey System. Technology by its nature is a \"transforming\" tool, enabling organizations and individuals to gain significant advantages in work and life. By 2001, computers and the Internet were used by a majority of the American population. Two-thirds of Americans used computers and over half used the Internet. In conjunction with this trend is the concerted national effort to ensure that all schools have access to computers and the Internet. Schools are working to increase access to technology by providing access to computers and the Internet outside of school hours. Fifty-three percent of schools provided access to an average of 49 computers outside school hours in 2002, and of the schools that provided such access, 74 percent did so before school, 96 percent after school, and 6 percent on weekends. In addition, 8 percent of schools, regardless of economic or racial make-up, lent laptops to students, and 7 percent provided handheld computers to students or teachers."}, {"section_title": "Participation in Technology-Based Postcompulsory Education", "text": "- ---------------------------------Lisa Hudson and Linda Shafer \nTo explore in greater depth which groups of adults are more or less likely to participate in technology-based education, one must take into account differences in participation rates in postcompulsory education generally. For example, a finding that females participate in technology-based education at the same rate as males would have different implications if females participated in all activities at a lower rate than males or at a higher rate than males. In effect, the question of interest is whether there are differences in who participates in technology-based versus non-technology-based education activities. To examine this question, one can compare the proportions of participants of each type (e.g., male vs. female) who are in technology-based education. If, for example, a higher proportion of male participants compared to female participants is in technology education, this would suggest that technology-based education is reaching relatively more men than women (accounting for each group's overall participation level). The right-hand column in table 2 shows the percent of participants with various characteristics who were in activities that used technology-based instruction. Although females were more likely than males to participate in postcompulsory education, male participants were more likely than female participants to be in technology-based activities. Fifty-seven percent of male participants were in activities that involve technology compared to 51 percent of female participants. This difference in participation in technology-based activities may reflect many influences, including gender differences in occupations or in learning preferences. 4 Also, although Blacks participated in postcompulsory education at a lower rate than Whites, no difference was detected in the likelihood of Black or White participants being in a technology-based activity. (The apparent differences between Whites and their Black and Hispanic counterparts in table 2 are not statistically significant, possibly due to relatively small sample sizes.) 5 Technology could be used specifically to reach adults in rural areas. However, participants in rural areas were less likely to be in technology-based activities than were participants in suburban or urban areas (table 2). Fortyseven percent of participants in rural areas were enrolled in technology-based education activities compared to about 55 percent of participants in suburban and urban areas."}, {"section_title": "This article was originally published as an Issue Brief. The sample survey data are from the Adult Education and Lifelong Learning Survey of the National Household Education Surveys Program (AELL-NHES).", "text": "Participation in both college programs and adult education activities has increased in recent decades (Kim and Creighton 1999;Kim et al. forthcoming;U.S. Department of Education 2002). The use of technology in education has also been increasing (Kleiner and Farris 2002;Waits and Lewis 2003), raising the possibility that technology could help increase participation in postcompulsory education overall and/or among groups of adults who traditionally have been underrepresented in education at this level. This Issue Brief addresses a more limited issue: Does technologybased education reach all adults equally, or are traditionally underrepresented or overrepresented adults more likely to be the beneficiaries of this type of education? It is important to note that this analysis cannot determine the extent to which participation is affected by learners' choices, their access to offerings, or the availability of offerings. The data for this analysis come from the 2001 Adult Education and Lifelong Learning Survey of the National Household Education Surveys Program (AELL-NHES:2001) at the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). This survey asks about adults' participation in the following formal learning activities: English as a Second Language (ESL) classes, adult basic education classes, apprenticeship programs, postsecondary education programs (leading to a credential), postsecondary courses, 1 and other courses. Technology-based learning was defined as learning activities that involve instruction using computers, computer conferencing, or instruction over the Internet or World Wide Web. 2 Participation in full-time postsecondary credential programs (which typically is excluded from NCES analyses of adult education) is included in this analysis. However, participation in adult basic education, ESL, and apprenticeship programs is excluded because the survey did not ask about the use of technology for these activities. (About 4 percent of all adult education participants were excluded from this analysis because they participated in only these activities.) To obtain more valid data on participation in ESL classes, the AELL-NHES survey was administered in both Spanish and English. However, this dual language administration makes the Hispanic AELL-NHES sample noncomparable to other racial/ethnic groups, since the Hispanic sample includes non-English (Spanish) speakers while the other (non-Hispanic) racial/ethnic groups consist of only English speakers. In particular, to the extent that non-English speakers utilize technology-based education to a different degree than English speakers, including Spanish speakers but not other non-English speakers would bias the comparisons of Hispanics and other groups. To create comparable racial/ethnic groups, the analysis in this Issue Brief was restricted to the English-speaking sample. Although this restriction means that the Hispanic sample does not represent all Hispanics (as is the case in analyses based on the full AELL-NHES sample), it does create an Englishspeaking Hispanic sample that is comparable to the Englishspeaking Asian sample, English-speaking Black sample, etc. 3 Using these definitions and population (of English speakers), 49 percent of adults participated in postcompulsory learning activities in 2001, and 54 percent of these participants engaged in at least one activity that used technology (table 1). Looking at the types of activities engaged in, 12 percent of adults participated in a postsecondary credential program, 11 percent in a postsecondary course (separate from a credential program), and 38 percent in a course outside of postsecondary education. Technology was used as an instructional tool most often for postsecondary credential programs (used by 65 percent of these participants), followed by postsecondary courses (47 percent of participants) and, finally, other types of courses (43 percent of participants). 1 Postsecondary education programs were defined as all activities listed in the two credential program sections (\"college or university degree program\" and \"vocational or technical diploma program\") of the survey; postsecondary courses were defined as all courses taken for college credit and all courses that had a postsecondary institution as the instructional provider. 2 The survey questions also asked about instruction using (1) television, video, or radio and (2) other types of technology. Because the focus of this analysis is new technologies, these instructional methods were not counted as technology-based instruction. Also, because the analysis focuses only on formal instruction, the use of technology for self-instruction (included in the \"work-related informal learning\" section of AELL-NHES:2001) is not part of this analysis."}, {"section_title": "3", "text": "The following statistics demonstrate the effects of including non-English-speaking Hispanics.

Further, with the exception of men and racial/ethnic minorities, groups under-or overrepresented in postcompulsory education tend to be correspondingly represented among those who participate in technology-based education rather than in non-technology-based education. These differences in participation in technology activities can arise from many sources, including differences in access to or availability of learning opportunities, personal interests and motivation, professional requirements, and other labor market incentives and opportunities. A better understanding of why these participation differences exist can help shed light on the potential and the limitations of technology as a tool for both increasing participation in learning and addressing possible inequities in participation.\nThe nation' s continued investment in school-based technology has resulted in significant progress toward achieving parity with regard to children' s and adolescents' computer and Internet access. Nevertheless, significant disparities remain by racial and economic characteristics and by disability status in technology use patterns among children across the country. It is important not to underestimate the role that continued investments in educational technology play, especially when the investments are aligned with educational goals. The challenge now is for an education system based on an agricultural calendar and organized after an Industrial Age model to transform itself to provide a 21st century education that prepares students for the Information Age. New circumstances demand not a reinforcing of Industrial Age structures and systems but rather a building anew with new initiatives, tools, and institutions for our time. Our nation needs a revolution in the way we educate students in order to meet the expectations of excellence set forth by NCLB. This is the strategic role of technology. As Secretary of Education Rod Paige states, \"We need to address the limited access to technology that many students have outside of school. There is much more we can do. Closing the digital divide will also help close the achievement gap that exists within our schools.\"* *See http://www.ed.gov/news/pressreleases/2003/10/10292003a.html."}, {"section_title": "Educational Technology", "text": "Invited Commentary: Children, Schools, Computers, and the Internet: The Impact of Continued Investment in Educational Technology Under NCLB ----------------------------------Susan Patrick, Director, Office of Educational Technology, U.S. Department "}, {"section_title": "of Education", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "This commentary represents the opinions of the author and does not necessarily reflect the views of the National Center for Education Statistics.", "text": "High-minority schools are also making strides toward achieving parity in connecting instructional rooms to the Internet. For example, in schools with the highest minority enrollment (50 percent or more), 89 percent of instructional rooms were connected to the Internet in 2002, while in schools with lower minority enrollments, 91 to 93 percent of instructional rooms had Internet access. Similarly, in schools with the highest poverty concentration (75 percent or more students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch), 89 percent of instructional rooms had Internet access in 2002, while in schools with lower poverty concentrations (less than 35 percent eligible students and 35 to 49 percent eligible students), 93 percent and 90 percent, respectively, of instructional rooms had access. It is important to note the significant strides that have been made over the past decade. In schools with the highest poverty concentration, only 2 percent of instructional rooms were connected to the Internet in 1994 and only 60 percent were connected in 2000.

For example, White children and adolescents were more likely to use computers in 2001 than their Black and Hispanic counterparts (93 percent vs. 85 and 79 percent, respectively). Differences in Internet use were wider, with 67 percent of White 5-to 17-year-olds using the Internet compared to 45 percent of Black and 37 percent of Hispanic 5-to 17-year-olds. Poverty status and disability are related to differences in computer and Internet use. Children and adolescents living in poor families were less likely to use computers (81 percent) and the Internet (37 percent) in 2001 than children and adolescents living in nonpoor families (93 percent and 65 percent, respectively). Children and adolescents with disabilities were less likely than those without disabilities to use computers (80 percent vs. 90 percent) and the Internet (49 percent vs. 59 percent). Disparities in computer use across groups of children and adolescents vary between home and school settings. For example, there was a relatively large gap in 2001 between the percentage of White 5-to 17-year-olds who used computers at home (77 percent) and Black and Hispanic 5-to 17-year-olds who used computers at home (41 percent for each group). The difference was smaller for the use of computers at school, where 84 percent of White 5-to 17year-olds used computers compared to 80 percent of Black and 72 percent of Hispanic 5-to 17-year-olds. Internet use varies similarly between home and school settings. Eighty-three percent of White 5-to 17-year-olds who used the Internet in 2001 did so at home compared to 60 percent of Black and 62 percent of Hispanic 5-to 17year-olds. When considering who uses the Internet at school, these differences largely disappeared, with 69 percent of White 5-to 17-year-old Internet users accessing the Internet at school compared to 66 percent of their Black and 67 percent of their Hispanic counterparts. Disparities in home versus school use are important because, while there is increased availability of computers at school and, in many cases, higher bandwidth, the preferred Internet access point for students may be home, rather than school."}, {"section_title": "Elementary and Secondary Education", "text": "Beginning in 2002, the NAEP national sample was obtained by aggregating the samples from each state, rather than by obtaining an independently selected national sample.

In 2001, after discussion among NCES, NAGB, and the Council of the Great City Schools, Congress appropriated funds for a district-level assessment on a trial basis, similar to the trial for state assessments that began in 1990, and NAGB passed a resolution approving the selection of urban districts for participation in the Trial Urban District Assessment (TUDA), a special project within NAEP. Representatives of the Council of the Great City Schools worked with the staff of NAGB to identify districts for the trial assessment. Districts were selected that permitted testing of the feasibility of conducting NAEP over a range of characteristics, such as district size, minority concentrations, federal program participation, socioeconomic conditions, and percentages of students with disabilities (SD) and limited-English-proficient (LEP) students. By undertaking the TUDA, NAEP continues a tradition of extending its service to education, while preserving the rigorous sampling, scoring, and reporting procedures that have characterized prior NAEP assessments at both the national and state levels. Average mathematics scores are reported on a 0-500 scale. Figure A shows the average scores at both grades for the districts that participated in 2003. The average scores for public school students in the nation and for public school students attending schools located in large central cities are also shown for comparison. \"Urban districts\" refers to the 10 districts reported in this trial study. Eight of the 10 urban districts consist entirely of schools in cities with a population of 250,000 or more (i.e., large central cities as defined by NCES); two of them (Charlotte and Los Angeles) consist primarily of schools in large central cities, but also have from one-quarter to one-third of their fourth-and eighthgrade students enrolled in surrounding urban fringe or rural areas. All of the data for both districts were used to compare with data from large central cities and the nation. At grade 4, the average score in Charlotte was higher than the average scores for the nation, large central cities, and the other participating districts. All participating districts at grade 4 except Charlotte had lower average scores than the average score for the nation. Compared with the average score in large central cities, the average scores in three districts (Houston, New York City, and San Diego) were not found to be significantly different, and the average scores in the remaining six districts were lower. At grade 8, the average score in Charlotte was again higher than the average scores for the nation, large central cities, and the other participating districts, while the average scores for all other districts were lower than that for the nation. Students in New York City also scored higher, on average, than students in large central city public schools, while the average scores for students in Boston, Houston, and San Diego were not found to be significantly different from that in large central cities. The average scores in the remaining five districts were lower than the average score in large central cities. As provided by law, NCES, upon review of a congressionally mandated evaluation of NAEP, has determined that achievement levels are to be used on a trial basis and should be interpreted and used with caution. However, both NCES and NAGB believe that these performance standards are useful for understanding trends in student achievement. NAEP achievement levels have been widely used by national and state officials. The NAEP mathematics framework, which defines the content for the 2003 assessment, was developed through a comprehensive national consultative process and approved by NAGB. The mathematics framework calls for the assessment to include questions based on five mathematics content areas: (1) number sense, properties, and operations; (2) measurement; (3) geometry and spatial sense; (4) data analysis, statistics, and probability; and (5) algebra and functions. In addition, the framework specifies that each question should measure one of three mathematical abilities. The three mathematical abilities specified by the framework are (1) conceptual understanding, (2) procedural knowledge, and (3) problem solving. The complete framework is available on the NAGB web site (http://www.nagb.org/pubs/ pubs.html).\nAverage reading scores by students' eligibility for free/ reduced-price school lunch.

In 2001, after discussion among NCES, NAGB, and the Council of the Great City Schools, Congress appropriated funds for a district-level assessment on a trial basis, similar to the trial for state assessments that began in 1990, and NAGB passed a resolution approving the selection of urban districts for participation in the Trial Urban District Assessment (TUDA), a special project within NAEP."}, {"section_title": "White", "text": "Representatives of the Council of the Great City Schools worked with the staff of NAGB to identify districts for the trial assessment. Districts were selected that permitted testing of the feasibility of conducting NAEP over a range of characteristics, such as district size, minority concentrations, federal program participation, socioeconomic conditions, and percentages of students with disabilities (SD) and limited-English-proficient (LEP) students. By undertaking the TUDA, NAEP continues a tradition of extending its service to education, while preserving the rigorous sampling, scoring, and reporting procedures that have characterized prior NAEP assessments at both the national and state levels. Average reading scores are reported on a 0-500 scale. Figure A shows the average scores at both grades for the participating districts. The average scores for public school students in the nation and for public school students attending schools located in large central cities are also shown for comparison. \"Urban districts\" refers to the 10 districts reported in this trial study. Eight of the 10 urban districts consist entirely of schools in cities with a population of 250,000 or more (i.e., large central cities as defined by NCES); two of them (Charlotte and Los Angeles) consist primarily of schools in large central cities, but also have from onequarter to one-third of their fourth-and eighth-grade students enrolled in surrounding urban fringe or rural areas. All of the data for both districts were used to compare with data from large central cities and the nation. Average reading scores for fourth-graders in Chicago and for eighth-graders in Atlanta increased between the 2002 and 2003 assessments. Among public school students in the nation, the average reading score at grade 4 did not change significantly from 2002 to 2003, and at grade 8 the average score decreased. In public schools in large central cities, the average score at grade 4 increased from 2002 to 2003. At both grades 4 and 8, the average score for each participating district was lower than the nation, except in Charlotte, where the average scores at grades 4 and 8 were not found to differ significantly from those of the nation."}, {"section_title": "Percentile Results From 2002 to 2003", "text": "Looking at changes in scores (for districts with 2 years of participation) for students at higher, middle, and lower 1 The NAEP achievement levels are as follows. Basic denotes partial mastery of prerequisite knowledge and skills that are fundamental for proficient work at each grade. Proficient represents solid academic performance for each grade assessed. Students reaching this level have demonstrated competency over challenging subject matter, including subject-matter knowledge, application of such knowledge to real-world situations, and analytical skills appropriate to the subject matter. Advanced signifies superior performance. Detailed descriptions of the NAEP reading achievement levels can be found on the NAGB web site (http://www.nagb.org/pubs/ pubs.html). 2 For Charlotte and Los Angeles, statistical comparisons restricted to just the schools in large central cities, as distinct from the whole-district comparisons used here, are available from the online Data Tool on the NAEP web site (http://nces.ed.gov/ nationsreportcard/naepdata).

An examination of scores at different percentiles on the 0-500 reading scale at each grade indicates whether changes in average score results are reflected in the performance of lower-, middle-, and higher-performing students. Comparing scores at percentiles also shows differences in performance across levels within 1 year. The percentile indicates the percentage of students whose scores fell below a particular score. For example, in 2003, a fourth-grade public school student would have had to score at least 193 to score above the 25th percentile in the nation, but would have had to score only 179 or better to score above the 25th percentile compared with students in large central cities. At grade 4, the national and large central city public school scores at the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles were not found to differ significantly from 2002 to 2003; the scores for the 50th and 75th percentiles for students in Chicago were higher in 2003 than in 2002. The score for students in the District of Columbia at the 25th percentile was lower in 2003 than in 2002. At grade 8, scores for public school students in the nation were lower at the 25th and the 50th percentiles in 2003 than in 2002; the score for students in Houston at the 75th percentile was also lower in 2003 than in 2002.

The sample survey data are from the School Survey on Crime and Safety (SSOCS).", "text": "In the United States, school safety continues to be a priority for educators, policymakers, parents, and the public (Elliott, Hamburg, and Williams 1998). Schools are responsible for the effective education of their students, and creating an environment in which students and teachers are safe is an important component of the education process. A safe school is necessary for students to learn and teachers to teach. As a result of highly publicized acts of extreme violence, increased national attention has focused on crime and violence in public schools. Reliable data collection is important in order to understand the extent to which American schools experience crime and violence, and to prevent emerging problems. Because of the need for accurate information on crime, violence, and disorder, the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) administered the 2000 School Survey on Crime and Safety (SSOCS), a survey of public schools in the United States. SSOCS is a nationally representative sample of 2,270 regular public elementary, middle, secondary, and combined public schools. It was designed to provide an overall picture of school crime and safety in the United States by asking school principals about the characteristics of school policies, school violence prevention programs and practices, violent deaths at school and elsewhere, frequency of crime and violence, disciplinary problems and actions, and other school characteristics that have been associated with school crime. The federal government has collected data about the safety of American schools from school principals for several decades. The first large-scale study, the Safe Schools Study, was administered to principals, teachers, and students in the 1970s. Since that time, the Department of Education has periodically collected information about crime and safety from school principals. SSOCS builds upon previous surveys conducted by NCES using the Fast Response Survey System (FRSS). These surveys collected a limited amount of information about crime and violence, disciplinary actions and problems, and policies related to school crime. The 2000 SSOCS questionnaire expanded on these topics and included additional topics related to school practices to prevent or reduce crime, violence prevention programs and activities, and other school characteristics that may be associated with the presence of crime at school. One of the topics covered by SSOCS was violence-related activities that occurred at public schools during the 1999-2000 school year. The focus of this report is the presence of violence and serious violence (a subset of violence) that occurred in American public schools. The incidents of violence collected in SSOCS included rape, sexual battery other than rape, physical attacks or fights with and without a weapon, threats of physical attack with and without a weapon, and robberies with and without a weapon. The measure of serious violence is a subset of these items that includes all of the incidents described above with the exception of physical attacks or fights without a weapon and threats of physical attacks without a weapon. The report from which this summary is excerpted provides the first analysis of the 2000 SSOCS. Additional information about this survey and other school crime surveys can be found at http://nces.ed.gov/programs/crime.

In all, approximately 1,466,000 such incidents were reported in public schools. s One or more serious violent incidents (including rape, sexual battery other than rape, physical attacks or fights with a weapon, threats of physical attack with a weapon, and robbery with and without a weapon) occurred in 20 percent of public schools."}, {"section_title": "School Demographic Characteristics and Violence", "text": "s Secondary schools were more likely than elementary, middle, and combined schools to report a violent incident during the 1999-2000 school year (92 percent of secondary schools vs. 61 percent, 87 percent, and 77 percent for elementary, middle, and combined schools, respectively) (figure A).

Students who receive their GED certificate by October 1 are not counted as dropouts if the state or district recognizes this as an approved program. Although a student whose whereabouts are unknown is considered a dropout, states are not required to count students who leave the United States as dropouts even if there is no information about such students' subsequent enrollment status.

The majority of reporting states in 2000-01 (26 of the 45) had dropout rates ranging from 4.0 to 7.0 percent. The median dropout rate of reporting states was 4.2. There were four states that had a dropout rate of less than 3.0: Iowa, New Jersey, North Dakota, and Wisconsin.

A total of 33 states reported publishable data for both 1993-94 and 2000-01. (Louisiana' s data were not comparable between these 2 years and were also not included in this analysis.) Among this group, the range of dropout rates generally decreased from 1993-94 to 2000-01. Dropout rates for reporting states in 1993-94 ranged from a low of 2.7 percent in North Dakota to a high of 13.7 percent in Arizona. Seven years later, the reported rates ranged from 2.2 percent in North Dakota to 10.9 percent in Arizona. Of those 33 states that had dropout rates in 1993-94 and 2000-01, 8 states (24 percent) reported dropout rates of less than 4 percent in 1993-94; this increased to 12 states (36 percent) in 2000-01. In 1993-94, dropout rates for 20 of the 33 states ranged from 4 to 7 percent. In 2000-01, 19 of the 33 states had dropout rates that ranged from 4 to 7 percent. Of those 33 states, 6 states reported dropout rates of higher than 7 percent in 1993-94, and only 3 states reported dropout rates of higher than 7 percent in 2000-01. Dropout rates were more likely to decline than increase over the 7-year interval: only 4 of the 33 reporting states' dropout rates increased and none by more than 1 percentage point. In this period, the dropout rates decreased by at least 2 percentage points in Arizona, Idaho, Missouri, Nevada, New Mexico, and Oregon.\nThe rate of high school completions over time includes diplomas and other high school completers, but excludes high school equivalencies. It is important to note that states have different policies in regard to awarding high school diplomas versus other high school credentials. Caution should be used when comparing states. This report includes 4-year completion rates for the 1994-95 through 2000-01 school years. Since 4 years of dropout data are required to calculate a 4-year high school completion rate, fewer than 15 states had completion rates in 1994-95 or 1995-96. For this reason, discussions of the 4-year completion rate over time are based on the 1996-97 and 2000-01 school years; there are 32 states that had 4-year high school completion rates in these 2 years. Seven of the states' 4-year completion rates went down between 1996-97 and 2000-01. The changes (increases and decreases) were relatively small: less than 2 percentage points The 4-year completion rate is calculated by dividing the number of high school completers in a given year by the number of high school completers in that year and dropouts over a 4-year period. 3 Other completers data are missing for the following states: New Hampshire, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. 4 Values for 1 year of the 4-year completion rate denominator are imputed. in 18 states.

Because of this, caution should be used when interpreting state differences. Relatively high dropout rates were most often observed in reporting school districts that served large or midsize cities and least frequently in rural areas. Nine reporting states had dropout rates of more than 10 percent in large city school districts, while only one state had a dropout rate of more than 10 percent for its rural school districts inside of a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA).\nReporting states' large city school districts were more likely than other districts to have a relatively low high school 4-year completion rate of less than 60 percent.

The reporting states' districts in urban fringes of large cities fared much better, with 19 (66 percent) with completion rates of 80 percent or more. The same was true for 25 (74 percent) of districts in urban fringes of midsize cities. Four-year completion rates of 80 percent or higher were more likely to occur in reporting states' rural school districts than in any other district locale.

The time that students spent in remediation was generally limited to 1 year or less; in fall 2000, a majority (60 percent) of institutions that offered remedial courses indicated that the average time a student spent in remediation was less than 1 year, about one-third (35 percent) indicated that the average time was 1 year, and 5 percent reported an average time of more than 1 year (table D). 6 Public 2-year colleges enrolled more of their entering freshmen in remedial courses (table C), and they reported longer average time periods that students spent in remediation (table D), compared with other types of institutions in fall 2000. For example, 42 percent of freshmen at public 2-year colleges and 12 to 24 percent of freshmen at other types of institutions enrolled in at least one remedial reading, writing, or mathematics course. Compared with private 4-year institutions, public 4-year institutions also enrolled a higher proportion of freshmen in one or more remedial reading, writing, or mathematics courses (table C), and they reported longer average time periods that students spent in remediation (table D). 6 Students may also choose to limit the time they spend in remediation in order to qualify for federal student aid.

Fall Enrollment file about the total number of first-time freshmen (both full and part time) enrolled at the institution. The IPEDS information about the total number of first-time freshmen was used (a) to convert the PEQIS questionnaire data on the percentage of entering freshmen enrolled in remedial education to the number of entering freshmen enrolled in remedial education at each institution, and (b) as a denominator to calculate the percentage of entering freshmen enrolled in remedial education across all institutions that enrolled freshmen. Thus, national estimates for the percentage of entering freshmen enrolled in remedial education were obtained by dividing the sum of entering freshmen enrolled in remedial education across all institutions by the sum of all first-time freshman enrollments across all institutions. To maintain comparability with previous estimates of freshman enrollment in remedial education, the information from IPEDS used in this calculation included only first-time, first-year students; other first-year students were not included. It is possible that institutions may have included both types of first-year students in their estimates of entering freshmen enrolled in remedial education. Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding. Between 1995 and 2000, no differences were detected in the proportion of entering freshmen who enrolled in at least one remedial reading, writing, or mathematics course (table C). Data on the reported time spent in remediation, however, suggest an increase in the average length of time that students spent in remedial education courses. For example, between 1995 and 2000, the proportion of institutions that reported an average of 1 year of remediation for students increased from 28 percent to 35 percent, while the proportion indicating an average of less than 1 year of remediation for students decreased from 67 percent to 60 percent (table D)."}, {"section_title": "Number of entering", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Institutional Structure of Remedial Programs", "text": "Institutions were asked about the following strategies for organizing and delivering remedial programs: the approach for selecting students who need remedial coursework, whether enrollment in remedial courses is mandatory or optional for students who were determined to need remediation, the kinds of restrictions placed on remedial coursetaking, the types of credit awarded for remedial coursework, and the primary provider of remedial courses at the institution. In fall 2000, the most common approach to select students for remedial coursework was to give placement tests to all entering students; 57 to 61 percent of institutions used this approach for remedial reading, writing, and mathematics courses. Institutions also tended to have mandatory placement policies for students who were determined to need remediation. In fall 2000, 75 to 82 percent of the institutions required students who were determined to need remediation to enroll in remedial reading, writing, or mathematics courses. Most institutions have some kind of restrictions on the extent to which remedial students can participate in regular courses and the type of credit awarded for remedial coursework. In fall 2000, 82 to 88 percent of institutions placed some restrictions on the regular courses that students could take while they were enrolled in remedial reading, writing, or mathematics courses. In addition, the most frequent type of credit given for remedial courses was institutional credit (e.g., counts toward financial aid, campus housing, or full-time student status, but does not count toward degree completion); 73 to 78 percent of the institutions most frequently gave institutional credit for remedial reading, writing, or mathematics coursework, 10 to 14 percent most often gave elective degree credit, and 2 to 4 percent most often gave subject degree credit. In fall 2000, about one-fourth (26 percent) of the institutions reported that there was a limit on the length of time a student may take remedial courses at their institution.

Finally, institutions tended to rely on their traditional academic departments as the primary providers of remedial education in fall 2000; a majority of institutions cited their traditional academic departments as the most frequent providers of remedial writing (70 percent), mathematics (72 percent), and reading courses (57 percent). Between 1995 and 2000, institutions tended to move toward more restrictive remedial policies on student participation in regular coursework during remediation. For each subject area, there was an increase in the proportion of institutions that had some restrictions on the regular courses that students could take while they were enrolled in remedial courses.

This Statistics in Brief examines the patterns and characteristics of individual involvement in community service activities from high school through early adulthood. Using data from the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88), this Brief describes the characteristics of young adults who volunteered, when they volunteered, why they volunteered, and for which types of organizations they volunteered. Based on data from the NELS:88 1992 sample of 12th-grade students-who were asked about their high school volunteer service for the period 1990-92 and then reinterviewed in 1994 and again in 2000-this Brief also examines whether high school volunteer service was related to volunteering 2 years and 8 years after their scheduled high school graduation. Major findings include the following: s After high school, young adults as a group were less active as community service volunteers (table 2). Forty-four percent of young adults volunteered in high school compared to 33 percent 8 years later, a 25 percent decline. s Individual volunteering patterns showed large variation. While about 68 percent of young adults volunteered at least once in the three survey periods, 12 percent volunteered consistently across all survey periods (figure 1 and table 2). s \"Consistent volunteers\" were more likely to be female (14 percent) than male (11 percent) and from households of higher socioeconomic status (SES) (table 2). s Females (50 percent) were more likely than males (38 percent) to volunteer in high school, but no differences were detected between the sexes 2 years out of high school (38 percent for males and 39 percent for females) (table 2). Male volunteering declined (to 29 percent) by the 8th year after scheduled high school graduation; no further change was detected in female volunteering (37 percent). s White young adults (47 percent) were more likely than Black (36 percent) and Hispanic (38 percent) young adults to volunteer in high school (table 2). Eight years after high school, Blacks (41 percent) were more likely than Whites (32 percent), Hispanics (31 percent), and Asians (27 percent) to report volunteering. s Students from households of high SES were more likely to volunteer in high school (60 percent) than students from households of both low (28 percent) and middle (41 percent) SES (table 2). Eight years later, however, volunteering by individuals from high SES households had dropped 35 percent compared to a 20 percent drop in participation by individuals from middle SES households. However, individuals from high SES households were still more likely to volunteer in the year 2000 than individuals from both low and middle SES households. s Volunteering in high school was related to later volunteering: -Fifty-four percent of adolescents who performed volunteer service in high school  volunteered again 2 years later, in 1994, whereas 27 percent of those who did not volunteer in high school volunteered in 1994 (table 3). -Forty-two percent of adolescents who performed volunteer service in high school  volunteered again 8 years later, in 2000, whereas 26 percent of those who did not volunteer in high school volunteered in 2000 (table 4). s No difference in the likelihood of volunteering 8 years after graduation was detected between young adults who performed only mandatory volunteer service in high school and students who performed no high school volunteering (28 vs. 26 percent, respectively) (table 4). Both of these groupsmandatory and nonvolunteers-were less likely to volunteer 8 years after high school than persons who were strongly encouraged to volunteer or did it for strictly voluntary reasons (43 percent)."}, {"section_title": "Changes in Volunteer Service Among Young", "text": "Young adults as a group were less active as community service volunteers after high school.

Examining the relationship between high school volunteering and volunteering later in life, students who volunteered in high school were more likely to volunteer 2 years later (54 percent) than students who did not volunteer in high school (27 percent) (table 3). Additionally, the relationship between high school volunteering and future volunteering may be related to the motivation behind high school volunteering. Students who volunteered solely because it was required-mandatory volunteers only-were still more likely to volunteer 2 years later than those who did no volunteering in high school (37 percent vs. 27 percent, respectively).

While these findings are not exhaustive or definitive, they point to several trends of interest. One trend is the general decrease in unpaid community service in the years after high school. As young adults moved on from high school into the worlds of postsecondary education and/or employment, fewer chose to take part in volunteering activities. While about 68 percent volunteered at least once, 12 percent volunteered consistently across the three survey periods. Individual patterns of volunteering revealed a range of onset and differing degrees of persistence among young adults in their volunteering activities. The general decrease in volunteering may result from any number of factors; possible causes include the weakening of incentives for service-such as school credit or approval from prospective postsecondary schools-after high school, a reduced number of visible and easily accessible volunteering opportunities in the lives of college students and young working adults, or a simple change in priorities or reduction in free time after leaving high school. A more detailed examination of this phenomenon would be of interest to those who would promote lifelong volunteering in general, or who belong to groups (e.g., religious organizations) seeking to retain young volunteers as they move into adulthood. 1 \"Any volunteering\" indicates participation with at least one type of organization. 2 This group reported performing volunteer work that was court-ordered, required for class, and/or required for another reason, and did not also indicate any other motivation. Another notable trend is that overall volunteering decreased after high school for most groups. Specifically, volunteering decreased for Whites, Asians, males, females, and persons from middle and high SES households. The decrease in volunteering followed different patterns over time for these groups; however, examining the social, religious, economic, and/or cultural factors that may play a role in shaping these patterns might contribute to a better understanding of what influences young adults to stop volunteering, or to volunteer persistently. A final trend of interest concerns the motivation to volunteer. Compulsory unpaid service has long been a subject of debate. Many have raised criticisms; Sobus (1995), for example, questioned the psychological wisdom of schools formally requiring prosocial behaviors. Others charge that such requirements cheapen true voluntarism, can act as a guise for school-sponsored political activism, and may in fact reduce future volunteering (Stukas, Snyder, and Clary 1999). On the other hand, the advent of community service requirements in schools is testament to some school officials' belief that requiring community service is a sound educational practice (Eyler 2002;Metz and Youniss 2003). This movement is supported by research that reports many individual and community benefits associated with volunteering (Metz and Youniss 2003). This debate clearly involves considerations beyond the empirical trends discussed here. Still, those trends are worth noting: there is a positive relationship between high school volunteering that was not motivated solely by a requirement, and later service; and no relationship between high school volunteering motivated by a requirement, and later service. Data from NELS:88 provide a valuable look at volunteering by young people, an activity that is widely heralded but not fully measured or understood. These empirical findings demonstrate that community service is a common part of the American young adult experience-at some point during the decade following their entry into high school, two-thirds of young people volunteered with churches, youth groups, hospitals, schools, sports teams, or some other organizations. Beyond this basic finding, however, is evidence of great variety in who volunteers, when, and for what. As schools and communities continue to promote unpaid service as a means to individual character and societal improvement, the relevance of empirical data about volunteering among young people will only increase."}, {"section_title": "Preprimary Education and Parental Education", "text": "s Black children are more likely than White or Hispanic children to be enrolled in center-based preprimary education at the ages of 3, 4, and 5. s The gap between the percentages of White and Black children whose mothers attained at least a high school education declined between 1974 and 1999, but some difference remained in 1999.
