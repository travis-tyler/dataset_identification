Midlife high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) is a measure which could help identify individuals at reduced risk of developing age-related cognitive decline. The Japan Public Health Centre-based prospective (JPHC) Study is a large population-based cohort which started in 1990. This study included 1299 participants from Saku area in Nagano prefecture. Participants had HDL-C measured in 1995-1996, and underwent a mental health screening in 2014-2015. Of these, 1114 participants were included in MCI analyses, and 781 participants were included in dementia analyses. Logistic regression models were used to determine odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association between HDL-C quartiles and MCI and dementia, respectively. For dementia analysis, quartiles 2-4 were collapsed due to low number of cases. Missing data was addressed through multiple imputations. There were 386 cases of MCI and 53 cases of dementia. Compared to the lowest HDL-C quartile, the highest HDL-C quartile was significantly inversely associated with MCI (OR = 0.47, 95% CI, 0.28-0.79) in the multivariable analysis. High HDL-C (quartiles 2-4) was inversely associated with dementia compared to low HDL-C (quartile 1) (OR = 0.37, 95% CI, 0.16-0.88).

High levels of HDL-C are inversely associated with both MCI 5 and dementia, 4, 6 albeit with some discrepant findings reporting no association between HDL-C and either cognitive function, [7] [8] [9] [10] MCI, 11, 12 or dementia. [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] Such ambiguity of results could be due to the timing of the HDL-C measure in relation to the cognitive impairment. Studies investigating the association between HDL-C and cognitive function have measured HDL-C at old age and often concomitantly with the assessment of cognitive function. Cholesterol levels decline prior to development of dementia, 19 and studies reporting HDL-C levels measured in late-life or at the time of disease may thus possibly suffer from reverse causation bias. Measuring HDL-C at midlife, i.e., years before disease onset may therefore allow for early intervention and lifestyle modification.\nThe primary aim of the present study was thus to investigate, in a prospective Japanese general population cohort, the association between midlife HDL-C and latelife MCI and dementia, respectively. We hypothesize that high levels of midlife HDL-C will be inversely associated with both late-life MCI and dementia."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study population", "text": "The Japan Public Health Center-based prospective (JPHC) Study was started in 1990 and conducted in two cohorts, one initiated in 1990 (cohort I) and the other in 1993 (cohort II). The study design has been described in detail elsewhere. 20 JPHC Study participants were identified by the population registries maintained by the local municipalities in 11 public health center (PHC) areas. At baseline, there were 140,420 individuals identified in the study population (eFig. 1). The participants of the present study were 12,219 individuals who in 1990 were aged 40-59 years and registered as residents of Saku PHC area (Nagano prefecture). Following the exclusion of those who had moved out of the Saku PHC area, had died, or did not respond to the JPHC Study baseline questionnaire (n = 3392), there were 8827 eligible participants who in 2014-2015 were invited to participate in a mental health screening. A total of 1299 individuals attended the screening. Of these, 1167 individuals were eligible for analyses in the present study following the exclusion of those with cardiovascular disease (CVD) (n = 19) defined through self-report or confirmed through hospital registers at the time of measuring HDL-C. Additionally, we excluded those who were diagnosed with depression at the time of the mental health screening (n = 113).\nFor the purpose of MCI analyses, we further excluded 53 individuals who were diagnosed with dementia at the time of screening, leaving 1114 participants of which 651 participants had complete information on all variables. For the purpose of dementia analyses, 386 persons with confirmed MCI were excluded, thereby leaving 781 participants for analyses of which 455 participants had complete information on all variables.\nSurveys of JPHC study participants were conducted on three occasions and included detailed questionnaires with information on socioeconomic and lifestyle factors. The present study used information from the baseline (1990) and 5-year follow-up survey (1995).\nAll participants provided written informed consent to take part in the mental health screening in 2014-2015, and the study has been approved by the Institutional Review Board of the National Cancer Center (approval number: 2013-096)."}, {"section_title": "Serum lipids", "text": "The details on obtaining participants' lipids have been previously described. 21 In brief, information was available for non-fasting total cholesterol (TC) and HDL-C, with TC measured using an enzymatic method.

There was no significant trend for the association between HDL-C and dementia."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "This study shows that HDL-C concentrations at midlife are associated with cognitive function assessed 19 years later. Compared to individuals with very low levels of midlife HDL-C, 1) those in the highest HDL-C quartile at midlife have less than half the risk of MCI in late life, and 2) those with higher HDL-C levels (quartiles 2-4) at midlife have a significantly lower risk of dementia in late life. These findings are comparable to previous studies investigating the association between HDL-C and MCI, 5 and dementia, 4, 6 respectively. There are, however, a number of studies which have failed to find any association between HDL-C and cognitive function, [7] [8] [9] [10] MCI, 11, 12 or dementia. [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] One possible explanation for our significant associations is the timing of HDL-C measure in relation to the assessment of cognitive function. The 19 years between HDL-C measure and assessment of cognitive function in our study is a major difference compared to available research which has almost exclusively investigated the association between late-life HDL-C and late-life cognitive outcomes. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] Cholesterol levels decline prior to development of dementia, 19 and may introduce bias to studies with concomitant late-life assessment of both HDL-C and cognitive function. It is important to consider early or midlife HDL-C measures given that the effect of lipids on cognition is most important before the age of 65, 33 and that midlife lipid measurement can result in early lifestyle interventions in order to effectively delay the onset of dementia. 34 In the present study only 13 individuals were above the age of 65 at the time of measuring HDL-C levels. Conversely, at the time of the mental health screening after 19 years of follow-up, only 13 individuals were younger than 65 years of age. The risk of bias due to age distribution in the present study can therefore be considered low.\nThe notable result of the present study is that midlife HDL-C is associated with both late-life MCI and late-life dementia. This strengthens the association between high midlife HDL-C levels and preserved cognitive function, but also makes a distinction of what constitutes low-risk midlife HDL-C levels for MCI and dementia, respectively. Table 2 The association between midlife serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) by multiple imputations using chained equations (n = 1114, m = 100) Whereas there was a significant linear trend with reduced risk of MCI with each increasing HDL-C quartile, the results for dementia indicate a marked reduction in the risk of dementia already from HDL-C quartile 2, with stable effect sizes throughout HDL-C quartiles 2-4. This suggests a possible threshold effect of midlife HDL-C on late-life dementia and emphasises that interventions and behavioural modifications which increase HDL-C, e.g., physical activity, moderate alcohol consumption, and smoking cessation 35 are, for dementia purposes, of particular importance among those with the very lowest midlife HDL-C levels. Moreover, our finding of a linear trend between HDL-C and MCI contrasted with the threshold effect for dementia indicates that MCI shares some, but not all, of the HDL-C related risk associated with dementia. This finding is in accordance with the suggestion that MCI is a heterogeneous diagnosis, 36 and may help explain why not all cases of MCI progress to dementia. 37 Future studies are therefore encouraged to investigate the effect of midlife HDL-C on the progression from MCI to dementia.\nOne important consideration is whether low midlife HDL-C is a marker specific for late-life cognitive impairment, or whether it indicates an overall increase of lifestyle-related midlife cardiovascular risk factors with a subsequently increased risk of late-life cognitive impairment. Our analyses indeed suggest that low midlife HDL-C is a marker of cognitive decline independent from other known and important midlife cardiovascular risk factors such as smoking, overweight/obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, LDL-C and TG. The biological mechanisms of such a protective effect of high HDL-C on both MCI and dementia, lie beyond the scope of the present study. In brief, the found associations could be due to: (1) genetic variants, e.g., I405V Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) which is associated with improved cognitive function, as well as higher HDL-C levels in the elderly, 3 (2) vascular changes given that HDL-C is inversely associated with lacunar infarction independently of other CVD risk factors, 38 and (3) interactions between HDL-C apolipoproteins and amyloid beta protein, a hallmark peptide of AD. 39 Apolipoproteins promote the degradation of amyloid beta protein, 40 as well as prevent its aggregation into amyloid. 41 The use of cholesterol lowering medication could be considered a potential source of confounding in any study investigating the association between HDL-C and MCI and dementia. In the present study, only 3.1% and 1.5% of participants for MCI and dementia analyses, respectively, reported the use of cholesterol lowering medication at the time of HDL-C measurement. This could be considered a relatively small proportion, however, a recent metaanalysis of prospective studies found that the use of statins is associated with a reduced risk of all-cause dementia and MCI. 42 Consequently, we adjusted for the use of cholesterol lowering medication in Model 3 of the complete case analyses, as well as following multiple imputations for both MCI and dementia outcomes.\nThere are a few limitations to this study. The long follow-up period has resulted in missing data due to death, as well as non-response to the original questionnaire and the mental health screening. Additionally, the proportion of missing values for HDL-C was approximately 40%. In 1995, HDL-C was not an obligatory measure during health check-ups in Japan, and the decision to measure HDL-C levels was decided by municipal policy or by health check-up physicians. This could possibly have resulted in a bias of the participants in the present study. However, instead of relying on complete case analyses, a potential source of biased estimates unless data is missing completely at random, we addressed the issue of missing data using multiple imputations. Overall, these results corresponded very well with those Table 4 The association between midlife serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels and dementia by multiple imputations using chained equations (n = 781, m = 100) Table 5 The association between midlife serum highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels (Quartile 1 vs. Quartiles 2-4) and dementia by multiple imputations using chained equations (n = 781, m = 100) obtained from complete-case analyses. Second, HDL-C levels were measured at only one point in time. Although HDL-C may change over time owing to lifestyle decisions or illness, it would not impact the main aim of this study which was to focus on midlife HDL-C levels. Third, cognitive function was not assessed at baseline However, given the average time of 19 years between HDL-C measure and the mental health screening in 2014-2015, it is highly probable that the majority of participants would have had a normal cognitive function in 1995. Fourth, this study did not allow for the differentiation of the type of dementia. Finally, the study population resided in a rural area of Japan and may therefore not be representative of urban populations. Despite these limitations, the study has a number of important strengths: This is a prospective study, in which the timing of HDL-C measure and the assessment of cognitive function were separated by approximately 19 years, thereby minimising any chance of reverse causation bias. Second, the detailed lifestyle questionnaire of the JPHC Study allows us to consider many important confounding factors for the found associations. Third, we have used multiple imputations to account for missing data and found robust associations between the exposure and the respective outcomes. Finally, MCI and dementia were classified by a trained psychiatrist in accordance with DSM-IV criteria."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "This study has found that high HDL-C levels in midlife are inversely associated with both late-life MCI and dementia.
