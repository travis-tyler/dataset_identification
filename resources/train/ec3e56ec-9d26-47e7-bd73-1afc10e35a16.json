[{"section_title": "", "text": "BEST COPY AMIABLE INTRODUCTION Summary Report 1996 is the thirtieth in a series of reports on research doctorates awarded by U.S. colleges and universities. The data for the report are from the annual Survey of Earned Doctorates, a census of research doctorate recipients from U.S. institutions. The report notes the continued, but slowing, increase in research doctorates and examines the number of doctorates awarded per doctorate-granting institution. Following an exploration of these general trends in the overall number of doctorates, the report examines trends in doctorate production by field, focusing on the seven broad fields in which doctorates received their degrees. Each of the seven broad fields consists of several \"major fields\" which are also examined. For example, biological sciences is a major field within the life sciences. The data examined reflect the fields that doctorate recipients themselves reported, using a specialties list provided at the end of the questionnaire. The discussion continues with sections examining trends in doctorate awards by gender, race/ethnicity, and citizenship. These are followed by sections describing time to degree, financial support during graduate school, and the postgraduation status and plans of doctorate recipients at the time the degree is awarded. The brief narratives of key survey findings in these sections are accompanied by figures displaying selected trend data. The numbers and percentages from which the figures are drawn are provided in a set of tables that follow the main text. Relevant tables are referenced at the bottom of the figures. The narratives also discuss key findings from data presented in the tables but not in the figures. Basic tables of data on 1996 doctorate recipients are displayed in Appendix A, and trend data on the 1986-1996 Ph.D. cohorts are presented in Appendix B. Appendix C provides technical notes that include nonresponse rates and other information related to tables and figures in the body of the report. Appendix D contains a copy of the Survey of Earned Doctorates questionnaire. Additional data from the Survey of Earned Doctorates and the Doctorate Records File are available on request. For a fee, off-the-shelf tables on the baccalaureate origins of Ph.D.s by major field of doctorate and tables on the citizenship, race/ethnicity, and gender of Ph.D.s by field are available to requesters. Customized tables can also be prepared at cost. For more information, please contact: The estimates reported for the Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED) are simple tabulations of all available information with no adjustment for nonresponse. Therefore, differences in response rates from year to year can produce numerical fluctuations that are unrelated to real trends. Although response to the SED has been 95 to 98 percent in most years, it declined to 92 percent during the 1980s. In an effort to improve the response rate, the survey methodology was modified in the years after 1989. Response has risen as hoped, stabilizing around 95 percent for 1991 to 1995. The response rate for 1996, however, was 92.8 percent. (Note: These percentages represent self-report rates, that is, the proportion of questionnaires completed by doctorate recipients. While survey forms containing partial information filled in by either the doctoral institution or staff of the National Research Council are not included in these rates, tables in this report incorporate the available data from these forms.) The selfreport rate for 1996 may increase slightly in the next year if additional questionnaires are received from doctorate recipients. See page 99 in Appendix C for a table giving survey response rates from 1965 to 1996. Item response rates have shown a parallel improvement since 1990a natural consequence of the increase in the overall self-report rate, as well as a result of format revisions to the questionnaire and follow-ups for missing information. In 1990, new follow-up procedures were implemented to increase coverage of several variables: birth year, gender, race/ ethnicity, citizenship status, country of citizenship, baccalaureate year and institution, and postgraduation plans. Response rates for these variables have since improvedespecially for citizenship and race/ethnicity, resulting in an increase in the reported numbers of minority Ph.D.s. Whether or not individuals completed the survey questionnaire, the following four data items are available for all recipients: gender, Ph.D. institution, Ph.D. field, and Ph.D."}, {"section_title": "year.", "text": "The data for a given year are updated the following year with any responses received after survey closure. Postsurvey adjustment was most significant for 1990 and 1991 Ph.D.s, with the largest impact on the number of blacks. For both of these years the total number of black Ph.D.s increased by about 7.5 percent in the year after survey closure. The survey cycle was then extended to allow receipt of more follow-up information before closure, resulting in much smaller postsurvey adjustments for 1992, 1993, 1994, and 1995 data (a 1.4 percent increase in black Ph.D.s for 1992, a 0.2 percent increase for 1993, a 0.5 percent increase for 1994, and a 1.5 percent increase in 1995). The same is expected for 1996 data. Adjustments to data are presented in reports subsequent to the initial report for a survey. Updates for 1994 appeared in Summary Report 1995, and those for 1995 are included in this year's report (see Appendix Table B-2 for adjustments to racial/ethnic data). The data for 1996 will likewise be subject to further revision, but as for the past three years, adjustments are expected to be minimal. Updates to 1996 data will be presented in next year's report. In using SED data the reader should keep in mind that numerical trends are affected by fluctuations in response rates. Increasing or decreasing numbers in a citizenship or racial/ ethnic group reflect to some degree any change in both overall survey response and item response."}, {"section_title": "TRENDS IN DOCTORATE RECIPIENTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Continued but Slowing Increase in Research Doctorate Awards", "text": "The 392 colleges and universities in the United States and its territories that conferred research doctorates in 1996 awarded a record 42,415 doctorate degrees.

Doctorate production reached a peak in 1973, declined slightly in the mid-1970s, and leveled off through 1985.

(See Table 2, page 35.) Figure 2 shows that annual growth rates for 1960 to 1970 ranged from 5.6 to 14.6 percent as doctoral programs and the number of institutions offering doctoral degrees expanded. This was a period in which the numbers of undergraduate and graduate students grew because of the baby boom, an increase in federal support for higher education, the availability of draft deferments for graduate study through 1968, and institutional expansion accommodating growing scientific research brought by the Cold War.2 Growth rates for the period 1986 to 1996 ranged from 1.5 to 5.1 percent. Doctorate awards increased only 1.6 percent from 1995 to 1996.

In 1996, 392 institutions in the United States and its territories granted research doctorates. (See Table 3, page 36.) As seen in Figure 3, the number of doctorates granted per institution annually has fluctuated over time, though it has increased overall since 1961. During the 1960s, when doctorate production tripled, the average number of Ph.D.s per institution doubled, from 60 in 1961 to 122 in 1970. As the number of institutions granting doctorates continued growing in the 1970s even though the number of doctorates awarded decreased, the number of Ph.D.s per institution steadily declined to the low nineties by the early 1980s. Since the late 1980s the number of doctorates awarded has grown faster than the number of institutions awarding them, and the number of doctorates per institution has increased to almost 110.

Together, they have grown in number, from 11,633 in 1966 to 28,049 in 1996. (See Table 4, page 37.) In 1996 more doctorates were awarded in life sciences than in any other broad field. The annual number of doctorates awarded in the life sciences grew from 5,734 in 1986 to 8,255 in 1996, a 44 percent increase. Within the life sciences, growth was fueled by a 72 percent increase in doctorates in health sciences and a 50 percent increase in biological sciences in the past decade. Doctorates in agricultural sciences grew only 4 percent since"}, {"section_title": "1986.", "text": "Though ranking second in the number of doctorates awarded among all broad fields, social sciences had below-average growth among broad fields over the past decade, growing at just 16 percent from 5,893 in 1986 to 6,814 in 1996. There were, however, substantial differences in growth among the major social science fields in the past decade: political science/international relations grew by 47 percent, economics by 17 percent, and psychology by 7 percent; sociology grew by 5 percent and anthropology by 4 percent. Sociology and anthropology decreased from 1986 to 1991 by 5 and 10 percent, respectively, before rebounding in the past five years. The \"other\" social sciences collectively grew by 57 percent, indicating more rapid growth among smaller fine fields. The annual number of doctorates in physical sciences grew from 4,807 to 6,675, or by 39 percent, between 1986 and 1996. The number of doctorates in 1996, though, is 133 fewer than in 1995. This broad field contains two major fields that have grown strongly in the past decade: computer sciences grew 131 percent and mathematics 54 percent since 1986. These two fields, however, dropped in the number of awards by 8 and 6 percent, respectively, from 1995 to 1996, helping to account for most of the overall decrease in physical science awards from 1995 to 1996. Engineering, which ranked fifth overall in number of awards, had both the most rapid growth and the largest numerical growth of any broad field from 1986 to 1996. The annual number of engineering doctorate awards grew from 3,376 to 6,305or 87 percentbetween 1986 and 1996."}, {"section_title": "Humanities, Education, and Professional Fields", "text": "As shown in Figure 5, education, humanities, and professional/other fields experienced strong growth in the 1960s and early 1970s, with their aggregate numbers increasing from 6,316 in 1966 to 14,363 in 1976. The total number of doctorates in these fields in 1996, though, was 14,366, almost the same as in 1976. (See Table 4, page 37.) Humanities doctorates increased in the 1960s and early 1970s, only to experience a sharp decline from 1974 to 1985. The number of humanities doctorates has since increased substantially, registering the second fastest growth rate among broad fields for the period 1986 to 1996, during which time the field grew 48 percent, from 3,461 to 5,116. History led this recent growth with a 52 percent increase from 1986 to 1996. American/English language and literature and foreign language and literature also had strong growth at 41 and 36 percent, respectively. As with other high-growth fields, these three major fields had declines in annual awards from 1995 to 1996. Doctorates in the \"other\" humanities grew at 52 percent, indicating strong growth in smaller fields. After a period of tremendous growth that peaked in the 1970s, the number of doctorates in education fields slowly declined until the late 1980s, when the number of education doctorates began to grow again. The number of annual doctorates in education rose from 6,649 to 6,772by just 2 percentbetween 1986 and 1996. This represents the smallest numerical and percentage growth among the broad fields. Teacher education and teaching fields registered large decreases in annual awards of 24 percent each between 1986 and 1996. Growth in education has come in \"other\" fields. Professional and other fields, the smallest of the broad fields at 2,478 in 1996, has enjoyed sustained growth over the past three decades. The number for 1996, though, is 7 percent less than in 1995. Among professional/other fields, communications increased 51 percent in the number of awards and business and management increased 41 percent from 1986 to 1996. As with other high growth fields, though, business and management declined from 1995 to 1996 in awards.

This figure is about eight times the number reported in 1966, when women earned 2,086 Ph.D.s., or about 12 percent of all Ph.D.s. Men earned 25,470 doctorates in 1996, up from 1995 and the highest number earned by men since 1975. The highest number ever earned by men was 27,754 in 1972. (See Table 5, page 38, and Appendix Table B-2, pages 95-97.) FIGURE 6 Doctorate recipients, total and by gender, 1966-1996 As seen in Figure 7, the percentage of Ph.D.s earned by women in the United States has increased considerably, especially in the past 30 years. Between World Wars I and II, women generally earned between 13 and 17 percent of doctorates awarded in the United States. After peaking slightly above 20 percent of all Ph.D.s during World War II, the percentage of doctorates earned by women dropped below 10 percent from 1949 to 1956 and then stabilized around 11 percent in the late 1950s and early 1960s. After 1965 the percentage of doctorates earned by women rose at a crisp pace until the 1980s, when it leveled off around 35 percent. The percentage has risen since 1989 to 40 percent in 1996.4 (See Table 6, page, 39.) 4While women constituted 40 percent of all doctorate recipients in 1996, they have earned the majority of baccalaureate and master's degrees for some time. In 1995, the most recent year for which data are available, women earned about 55 percent of baccalaureate and master's degrees awarded by U.S. colleges and universities (U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, \"Completions\" survey, 1994-1995).  As seen in Figure 8, the percentage of doctorates earned by women has risen even more dramatically among U.S. citizens. The number of U.S. men earning doctorates has risen since their low number in 1987. Still, at 14,700 in 1996, U.S. men earned only threequarters of the number of doctorates they earned in the early 1970s. Meanwhile, the number of U.S. women earning Ph.D.s has risen steadily. Thus, while women earned just one-quarter of doctorates earned by U.S. citizens in 1976, they earned 47 percent of doctorates awarded to U.S. citizens in 1996. Among non-U.S. citizens with permanent visas, women earned 34 percent of doctorates in 1996; among temporary residents, women earned 23 percent. While women have earned an ever-larger percentage of Ph.D.s, the number and percentage of Ph.D.s earned by women varied substantially by field as can be seen in Figure  9. (See Table 5, page 38.) In 1996 a greater number of doctorates were awarded to men than to women in five of seven broad fields. Women remained outnumbered in life sciences (earning 44 percent of Ph.D.$), professional/other fields (38 percent), physical sciences (21 percent), and engineering (12 percent). In the fifth field, humanities, men earned only slightly more Ph.D.s than women (2,572 men and 2,544 women). Women continued to earn the majority of doctorates in education (62 percent). For the second year in a row, women also outnumbered men in social sciences (3,514 to 3,300). The number of female Ph.D.s has increased in every broad field over the past 30 years, and gains continued from 1995 to 1996 in every broad field except physical sciences, for which the number of women dropped from 1,499 to 1,384, and professional/other fields, in which the number of women dropped from 980 to 953."}, {"section_title": "BEST COPY AVALABLE", "text": "The field with the highest growth rate for women in the past decade was engineering, in which the number of female doctorates increased by 245 percent, growing from 225 in 1986 to 776 in 1996. Engineering, though, remains the broad field in which women earned the fewest and smallest percentage of doctorates. The largest numerical change for women was in life sciences, in which the number of women jumped from 1,984 in 1986 to 3,595 in 1996. Women earned their highest number of doctorates in education, at 4,179 in 1996; this field had the slowest growth rate for women over the past decade, at just 16 percent. FIGURE 9 Number of female doctorate recipients, by field, 1986, 1991, 1996. 4 As in 1995, almost 13 percent of the doctorates awarded to U.S. citizens in 1996 were earned by racial/ethnic minoritiesAsians, blacks, Hispanics, and American Indiansup from 11 percent in 1994.5 The overall minority share of doctorates has increased by over 6 percentage points since 1976. (See Table 7, page 40, and Appendix Table B-2, pages 95-97.) Among U.S. citizens, as shown in Figures 10 and 11, three of the four racial/ethnic minority groups reached record numbers in 1996: The number of blacks receiving doctorates increased 18.9 percent from 1,101 in 1994 to 1,309 in 1995, and the number of blacks remained at this higher level with 1,315 in 1996. At 4.8 percent in 1996, blacks earned their highest proportion among U.S. Ph.D.s ever. Of the 18 institutions awarding the most baccalaureates to blacks who later received Ph.D.s between 1992 and 1996, 11 are Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). (See Table 9, page 42.) Three HBCUs are also among the 20 institutions that awarded the most Ph.D.s to blacks between 1992 and 1996. (See Table 10, page 43.) The number of Asians receiving doctorates increased by 20 percent from 950 in 1994 to 1,140 in 1995 but decreased slightly to 1,091 in 1996, still a 15 percent increase over 1994. Asians received 4 percent of all doctorates awarded to U.S. citizens in 1996, three times as high as in 1976. Hispanics continued to increase their numbers among U.S. citizens receiving doctorates, rising from 884 in 1994 to 919 in 1995 and 950 in 1996. Their share of U.S. citizen doctorates is now nearly 3.5 percent. The number of American Indians receiving doctorates jumped 25 percent from 149 in 1995 to 186 in 1996, their highest number ever among U.S. citizens. The percentage of U.S. citizens earning Ph.D.s who are American Indians increased from 0.2 percent in 1976 to 0.7 percent in 1996.  "}, {"section_title": "Race by Field", "text": "Racial and ethnic minorities received almost 13 percent of all doctorates awarded to U.S. citizens in 1996. As a group they accounted for more than 16 percent of doctorates in both education and engineering. They accounted for between 9 and 13 percent of Ph.D.s in each of the remaining broad fields. (See Tables 7 and 8, pages 40 and 41.) In 1996 blacks, Hispanics, and American Indians earned their largest numbers of doctorates in the fields of education or social sciences. Life sciences and engineering were the leading fields for Asians. Among blacks, 44 percent of all doctorates were in the field of education in 1996 as in 1995. Blacks received 10 percent of all Ph.D.s awarded to U.S. citizens in that field. Another 20 percent of blacks earned their Ph.D.s in social sciences. In 1996 half of all doctorates earned by Asians were in life sciences and engineering. Asians received 11 percent of Ph.D.s awarded to U.S. citizens in engineering and about 6 percent in life sciences. In 1996 almost half of the doctorates earned by Hispanics were in education or social sciences. Another 30 percent received their Ph.D.s in life sciences and humanities. More than 50 percent of all doctorates earned by American Indians in 1996 were in education and social sciences. Indeed, about half of the large increase from 1995 to 1996 in doctorate awards to American Indians was in the field of education, with the next largest numerical increase in social sciences.  Citizenship U.S. citizens earned slightly over two-thirds of the doctorates awarded to those with known citizenship in 1996. After a one-year drop in numbers from 1994 to 1995, the number of non-U.S. Ph.D.s increased again in 1996. Non-U.S. citizens, in fact, account for most of the growth in the overall number of Ph.D.s since 1986. Meanwhile, trends among doctorate recipients from China have affected the percentage of non-U.S. citizens holding permanent as opposed to temporary visas in the past five years. The percentage of permanent residents increased substantially from 1992 to 1995; in 1996 it decreased. (See Tables 11 and 12, pages 44 and 45.) As shown in Figure 13, the number of U.S. citizens earning doctorates in 1996 was 27,741, one more than the 27,740 earned in 1995.

During this period, the percentage of doctorates granted to non-U.S. citizens increased from 23 to 33 percent of all doctorates awarded. The mix of temporary and permanent visa holders among the growing numbers of non-U.S. citizens earning Ph.D.s in the United States shifted dramatically over the past five years. The total number of temporary visa holders declined in 1993, 1994, and 1995, while the number of permanent visa holders grew dramatically. Temporary visa holders dropped from 83 percent of non-U.S. citizens in 1991 and 1992 to just 67 percent in 1995. In 1996, however, the number of temporary residents grew again in number and in percentage of all non-U.S. citizens, climbing back to 72 percent. As seen in Figure 14, this change tracks the implementation of provisions in the Chinese Student Protection Act of 1992. This act made thousands of citizens of China who had been students in the United States at the time of the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre eligible for permanent residency here as of July 1, 1993. It thus drove up the number of Chinese students graduating with permanent visas from 192 (or 9 percent of all Chinese Ph.D.$) in 1992 to 2,366 (or 80 percent of all) in 1995. As the remaining number of Chinese students who were enrolled here in 1989 dwindles, the percentage holding permanent visas at graduation is reversingdropping from 80 percent in 1995 to just 56 percent in 1996. It will likely drop further next year.

(See Table 11, page 44.) Non-U.S. citizens have for some time made up a larger percentage of new Ph.D.s in engineering than in other disciplines, but that may be changing. The percentage of awards in life sciences made to non-U.S. citizens grew from 19 percent in 1986 to 38 percent in 1996, and in physical sciences from 33 to 47 percent during that period.

Also, while there has been a larger number of non-U.S. Ph.D.s in engineering than in other fields, the number of non-U.S. citizen Ph.D.s in life sciences increased more rapidly than the number in engineering from 1986 to 1996. The number of non-U.S. citizens earning Ph.D.s in engineering increased 105 percent, from 1,715 in 1986 to 3,508 in 1996, but the number of non-U.S. citizens in life sciences increased 184 percent, from 1,076 in 1986 to 3,057 in 1996.

As shown in Figure 19, TTD and RTD varied considerably by field. In 1996 doctorate recipients in education had the longest median TTD (20.2 years), while those in physical sciences had the shortest (8.3 years). The longest median RTD was in the humanities (8.3 years), and the shortest median RTD was in engineering (6.4 years). Time to degree was longer for women than for men, but the difference was often minimal within the same broad field. Blacks had the longest time to degree of all U.S. racial/ ethnic groups, largely because their highest percentage of degrees was in the field of education. U.S. citizens and permanent residents exhibited longer time-to-degree rates than did temporary residents. (See Table 16, page 48.)  See Tables 15 and 16, pages "}, {"section_title": "Financial Support", "text": "As in previous years, university funding (mostly via teaching and research assistantships) was the primary source of graduate school support for the majority of 1996 Ph.D.s (52 percent). (See Figure 20.) Another 35 percent of Ph.D.s were primarily supported by personal resources (their own earnings, family contributions, loans) and the remaining 13 percent by resources from federal or state governments, nonfederal competitive fellowships, businesses, and employers. (See Table 17, page 49.) As seen in Figure 21, the type of primary support varied greatly by field. University sources were reported by more than half of Ph.D.s in physical and life sciences and engineering. Personal resources were easily the most typical in education (75 percent). Fifty-eight percent of male Ph.D.s cited university funding as their primary source of support. Female Ph.D.s relied in equal portions on personal resources (45 percent) and university funding (43 percent) as their primary support. Differences between men and women were minimal within humanities, education, and professional/other fields. Differences largely disappeared within science and engineering fields, though several variations are noteworthy: a higher percentage of women than men in engineering cited federal funding as a primary source of support; men reported higher university support in life and social sciences while women reported higher personal support in these fields. U.S. citizens reported higher levels of personal and federal support than did non-U.S. citizens. Overall, more than 70 percent of non-U.S. citizens cited university support as their primary source of financing. Among U.S. citizens, a majority of Asians (54 percent) cited university support as primary. Hispanics reported university and personal sources as primary in equal numbers, about 40 percent each. Blacks, whites and American Indians reported personal support as primary.  Almost half (48 percent) of all Ph.D.s in 1996 reported debt related to their combined undergraduate and graduate education. The majority of those with debt (57 percent) reported owing more than $10,000. (See Table 18, page 50.) As shown in Figure 22, Ph.D.s in engineering were the least likely to have incurred educational debt (37 percent), while those in social sciences were the most likely (62 percent). More than two-thirds of social sciences Ph.D.s with debt owed more than $10,000, and over one-quarter owed more than $30,000. By contrast, more than half of the indebted Ph.D.s in physical sciences and engineering and nearly half of those in life sciences owed $10,000 or less. Men and women reported debt in nearly equal proportions and had similar distributions across levels of debt. Among U.S. citizens, Hispanics and blacks were the most likely racial/ethnic groups to have educational debt and to report the highest level of debt. (See Table 19, page 50.) Non-U.S. citizens were much less likely to have incurred debt than U.S. citizens, the majority of whom were indebted. Temporary residents were more likely than permanent residents to report debt and a slightly higher percentage of temporary than permanent visa holders reported debt of more than $30,000.  "}, {"section_title": "Postgraduation Status and Plans", "text": "As shown in Figure 23, the proportion of Ph.D.s reporting definite postgraduation commitments for employment or postdoctoral study at the time the doctorate is earned declined from about three-fourths in the 1970s and 1980s to about two-thirds in the mid-1990s. In 1996 about one-third of new doctorate recipients were still seeking employment or study at the time they received their doctorates. (See Table 20, page 51.) In 1996 doctorate recipients in education were the most likely to have a definite commitment for work or study-74 percent of education doctorates had such commitments. Doctorates in the humanities were the least likely to have a commitment for work or study at 59 percent, leaving 41 percent of humanities doctorates seeking employment or studyusually employmentat graduation. Among science and engineering fields, 71 percent of doctorates in life sciences had commitments for work or study, followed by doctorates in physical sciences at 67 percent, social sciences at 65 percent, and engineering at 64 percent. In 1996 similar proportions of men and women had definite commitments, 68 and 67 percent, respectively. U.S. citizens, at 71 percent, were far more likely than non-U.S. citizens to have commitments at graduationonly 60 percent of permanent visa holders and 62 percent of temporary visa holders had commitments. Among U.S. citizens and permanent residents, 71 percent of Hispanics had a definite commitment for work or study, followed by whites and American Indians at 70 percent each and blacks at 68 percent. Asians were the least likely to have definite commitments, at 62 percent. (See Table 21 "}, {"section_title": "39", "text": "Of those Ph.D.s in 1996 who reported definite postgraduation commitments, 71 percent planned to be employed, while 29 percent planned postdoctoral study. (Postdoctoral appointments are considered to be study rather than employment in this report.) As shown in Figure 24, the proportion of new Ph.D.s with postdoctoral study plans has steadily increased since 1976, when only 18 percent planned further study. (See Table 22, page 53.) Doctorate recipients in education and professional/other fields were the most likely to have commitments that were for employment (97 and 96 percent, respectively), followed closely by humanities Ph.D.s (92 percent). Commitments for further study were by far the most common in life sciences (65 percent). The percentages of physical and life sciences Ph.D.s whose commitments were for employment were up slightly in 1996. The majority of Ph.D.s in every major demographic group with commitments had them for employment rather than study after graduation. A higher percentage of women (74 percent) than men (68 percent) had commitments for employment. Among the aggregate of U.S. citizens and permanent residents, blacks had the largest proportion with work plans (about 85 percent), and Asians had the largest proportion with study plans (44 percent). (See Table 23, page 54.) These patterns are explained mainlyand for blacks and women, entirelyby the fields in which these different groups tend to earn degrees. Upon graduation, almost three-quarters of U.S. citizens had commitments for employment compared to about 60 percent for non-U.S. citizens. About 40 percent of permanent and temporary visa holders planned to continue their studies.  "}, {"section_title": "29", "text": "Of those non-U.S. citizens who reported definite postdoctoral commitments in 1996, permanent residents were much more likely than temporary residents to plan to remain in the United States immediately after graduation (92 versus 62 percent). However, as shown in Figure 25, while the proportion of permanent residents who remain in the United States immediately after graduation has remained around 90 percent over time, the proportion of temporary resident Ph.D.s planning to stay for at least some period of time has increased steadily since 1976 when 34 percent stayed. (See Table 24 In 1996, as before, academe was the primary employer of U.S. citizens and permanent residents who had definite commitments for employment in the United States after graduation. As shown in Figure 26, the proportion of Ph.D.s intending to work in academe has fluctuated over the past two decades. In 1976, 60 percent of U.S. citizens and permanent residents with employment commitments were headed for academia. By 1986 the proportion had declined to 49 percent; it rose to 54 percent in 1995 but declined once more in 1996 to 51 percent. Plans for employment in industry (including selfemployment), meanwhile, increased from 12 percent of Ph.D.s in 1976 to 22 percent in 1996. (See Table 26, page 57.) The sector of planned employment for Ph.D.s varied by field. In 1996 academic employment plans were most predominant in the humanities (81 percent) and professional/other fields (73 percent). Industry was most frequently reported among engineers (66 percent) and physical scientists (53 percent), for whom there were sizable increases in industrial employment from 1995 to 1996. In 1996 academic employment plans were more prevalent among women (56 percent) than men (46 percent) and, as has been the case since 1992, women outnumbered men (3,843 to 3,536) among doctorates with commitments for academic employment. The proportion of men in industry (30 percent) was more than twice that of women. (See Table 27, page 58.) The majority of Ph.D.s among every racial/ethnic group but Asians reported plans to work in academe. Asians favored industry, jumping from 51 percent in 1995 to 59 percent in 1996. The sectors chosen by the various demographic groups are partially explained by their fields of specialization.                 6.6 7.4 7.6 7.5 NOTE: Median calculations are based on the number of individuals who provided complete information about their postbaccalaureate education. \"Total\" time to degree measures the number of years elapsed between receipt of the baccalaureate and the Ph.D. \"Registered\" time to degree gauges the amount of time enrolled in graduate school, including master's degrees and enrollment in nondegree programs.

The subfields correspond to the fields on the questionnaire's Specialties List located at the back of this report. Field groupings may differ from those in reports published by federal sponsors of the Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED). See inside the back cover for a description of field groupings as reported in these tables. The \"general\" field categoriese.g., \"chemistry, general\"include individuals who either received the doctorate in the general subject area or did not indicate a particular specialty field. The \"other\" field categoriese.g., \"chemistry, other\"include individuals whose specified doctoral discipline was not among the specialty fields listed.  all doctorate recipients from the most recent year; the other two tables present the same data by gender. Field groupings may differ from those in reports published by federal sponsors of the SED. See inside the back cover for a description of field groupings as reported in these tables; see the questionnaire's Specialties List at the back of the report for the names and codes of the subfields included. Terms requiring definition are as follows: Percentage with Master's: The percentage of doctorate recipients in a field who received a master's degree in any field before earning the doctorate. Median Age at Doctorate: One-half received the doctorate at or before this age. A recipient's age is obtained by subtracting the month/year of birth from the month/year of doctorate. (See note on next page.) Median Time Lapse: \"Total Time\" refers to the total calendar time elapsed between the month/year of baccalaureate and the month/year of doctorate. \"Registered Time\" refers to the actual time in attendance at colleges and universities between receipt of the baccalaureate and the doctorate. Enrollment includes years of attendance not related to a recipient's doctoral program. NOTE about medians: The method of computing medians has been revised. Beginning with Summary Report 1994, months (of birth, baccalaureate, and doctorate) are included in the calculations; medians presented in earlier reports were based only on years. Some medians would be the same regardless of the method of computation, but the new method generally computes slightly different results than are obtained by the old method. While variation is small (usually one or two decimal places), the reader should consider these differences when comparing medians presented in this report with those in earlier reports. Postgraduation Plans: Each year's doctorate recipients provide information on postgraduation employment or study plans in response to items B1 through B9 on the survey form. Since the questionnaire is filled out around the time the doctorate is awarded, a recipient's plans are subject to change. However, comparisons with the longitudinal Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR) have shown SED data to be a reasonable indicator of actual employment status in the year following the doctorate, although results vary by sector. (The SDR, also conducted by the National Research Council, is a follow-up employment survey of a sample of doctorate recipients in science, engineering, and humanities fields.) In Table A-3 the postgraduation plans of doctorate recipients are grouped as follows: \"Postdoctoral Study Plans\" (fellowship, research associateship, traineeship, other), \"Planned Employment After Doctorate\" (educational institution, industry, etc.), and \"Postdoctoral Plans Unknown.\" These categories include recipients who were still negotiating or seeking positions at the time of survey completion, as well as those whose plans were definite. The sum of these lines equals 100 percent for each column, with allowance for rounding: for example, 21.9 percent of all engineers had postdoctoral study plans, 69.6 percent planned to be employed, and 8.4 percent did not report their postgraduation plans, totaling 100 percent. The study and employment rows are further subdivided. The data on study plans show that 7.0 percent of all engineers planned to pursue postdoctoral fellowships; 13.0 percent, research associateships; 0.9 percent, traineeships; and 1.0 percent, some other form of postdoctoral study. These percentages sum to 21.9 percent, the proportion of engineers who reported plans for postdoctoral study. The employment row is similarly subdivided by type of employer. The percentages for these rows add to 69.6 percentthe proportion of engineering Ph.D.s who planned employment. The category for educational institutions includes elementary and secondary schools as well as colleges and universities, and the category for government includes military service. The four lines of data beginning with \"Definite Postdoctoral Study\" distinguish between individuals who had definite postgraduation plans at the time of survey completion (item B 1: \"Am returning to, or continuing in, predoctoral employment\" or \"Have signed contract or made definite commitment\") and those who were still seeking employment or postdoctoral study (item Bl: \"Am negotiating with one or more specific organizations,\" \"Am seeking position but have no specific prospects,\" or \"Other\"). These four lines, when added to the prior line, \"Postdoctoral Plans Unknown,\" total 100 percent with allowance for rounding. The two lines \"Definite Postdoctoral Study\" and \"Seeking Postdoctoral Study\" 63 add to give the percentage for \"Postdoctoral Study Plans\"; the two lines \"Definite Employment\" and \"Seeking Employment\" add to give the percentage for \"Planned Employment After Doctorate.\" Percentages showing the distribution of doctorate recipients by postdoctoral work activity and region of employment are based only on the number of recipients who had definite employment commitments at the time they completed the questionnaire. These percentages exclude recipients who planned postdoctoral study (as described above) and recipients who were still seeking employment at the time they completed the questionnaire. (Note that the rows on specific postdoctoral study and employment plans discussed earlier include individuals whose plans were not definite.) Revisions to the questionnaire format beginning in 1990 resulted in higher rates of nonresponse to the item on work activity through 1993, when the rate was 15.1 percent. The questionnaire was revised again in 1994, and nonresponse subsequently dropped to 11.9 percent in 1994 and 10.7 in 1995. A final revision in 1995 dropped the nonresponse for this item to just 3.4 percent in 1996. The U.S. regions of employment shown in Table A Tables A-3 and A-5. Field groupings may differ from those in reports published by federal sponsors of the SED. See inside the back cover for a description of field groupings as reported in these tables; refer to the questionnaire's Specialties List at the back of the report for the names and codes of the subfields included. The racial/ethnic question has undergone several revisions over the years. In 1977 it was modified to correspond to a standard question format recommended by the Federal Interagency Committee on Education and adopted by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for use in federally sponsored surveys; an explanation of the effect of these changes is detailed on page 13 of Summary Report 1977. (Note: Changes in the OMB guidelines prompted the moving of persons having origins in the Indian subcontinent from the white category to the Asian category.) In 1980 the item was further revised in two ways: (1) the 64 Hispanic category was subdivided into Puerto Rican, Mexican American, and other Hispanic to provide more detail for users of the racial/ethnic data, and (2) respondents were asked to check only one racial category. (Before 1980 doctorate recipients could check more than one category to indicate their race.) The item was modified again in 1982 to separate the questions on race and ethnicity. Since then respondents have been asked to first check one of the four racial group categories (American Indian, Asian, black, or white) and then indicate whether or not they are Hispanic. In Table A-4, Ph.D.s who reported Hispanic heritage, regardless of racial designation, are included in one of three Hispanic groups: Puerto Rican, Mexican American, or other Hispanic. The remaining survey respondents are then counted in the respective racial groups. (Note: Doctorate recipients who checked the category \"American Indian or Alaskan Native\" are identified as American Indian in this report.) NOTE about median age and time lapse (to doctorate): The method of computing medians has been revised. Beginning with Summary Report 1994, months (of birth, baccalaureate, and doctorate) are included in the calculations; medians presented in earlier reports were based only on years. Some medians would be the same regardless of the method of computation, but the new method generally computes slightly different results. While variation is small (usually one or two decimal places), the reader should consider these differences when comparing medians presented in this report with those in earlier reports. See explanatory information on Table A-3 for further description. In the section on \"Graduate School Support\" a recipient counts in more than one category if support was received from multiple sources. Because a student counts once for each of his/her sources of support, the vertical percentages sum to more than 100 percent. See the explanatory note on Appendix Table A-5 for further detail. (Data on the primary source of support for doctorate recipients are presented in the body of the report.) The other sections in Table A-4 correspond to many of those in Appendix Table A-3. The reader is referred to the explanatory note on Table A-3 for additional   information. TABLE A-5: Table A-5 displays data reported in item All on sources of financial support received during graduate school, by broad field and gender of recipient. Field groupings may differ from those in reports published by federal sponsors of the SED. See inside the back cover for a description of field groupings as reported in this table; see the questionnaire's Specialties List at the back of the report for the names and codes of the subfields included. A recipient counts in more than one category in Table A-5 if support was received from multiple sources. Because a student counts once for each of his/her sources of support, the vertical percentages sum to more than 100 percent. (Data on the primary source of support for doctorate recipients are presented in the body of the report.) Beginning with Summary Report 1990, federal research assistantships (RAs) have been aggregated with university RAs and shown under \"University Research Assistant\" in Table A-5. (Focus groups of doctoral candidates have indicated uncertainty as to the source 74 of their RA funding; it is therefore likely that some RAs have incorrectly identified support provided by the federal government as university rather than federal.) The reader is advised not to compare sources of support data presented in the 1990-1996 Sununary Reports with data in earlier reports because percentages appear higher for university support and lower for federal support in tables where all RAs are aggregated as \"University Research Assistants.\" The data in Table A-5 should be interpreted as follows: 223 male doctorate recipients in the physical sciences in 1996 reported financial support from federal fellowships or traineeships during graduate school. This number is 4.5 percent of the male physical sciences Ph.D.s who answered the question on sources of support, and 13.2 percent of all males in any field who reported federal fellowship or traineeship support.          8.3 10.0 8.3 9.0 7.9 8.9 8.7 14.3 11.4 9.6 6.7 7.2 6.7 6.4 6.6 7.0 6.9 7.8 6.7 7.0 30.0 16.2 42.6 21.9 80.5 70.8 72.1 19.0 32.2 57.8 14.8 6.2 18.3 7.0 49.9 41.7 42.8 10.8 9.6 32.8 10.1 8.7 21.8 13.0 22.8 19.9 20.3 5.4 21.0 18.0 2.4 0.7 0.9 0.9 2.8 3.0 3.0 0.9 2.2 2.0 3.8 5.1 2.7 8.7 8.5 8.7 8.4 5.9 5.9 5.9 9.9 8.5 6.9 19.3 11.7 30.6 12.9 61.2 53.2 54.3 13.0 18.0 42.4 10.7 4.5 12.0 9.0 19.3 17.5 17.8 6.0 14.2 15.4 37.7 53.1 30.9 44.7 7.4 14.4 13.5 50.5 36.9 22.8 23.5 22.3 17.7 24.9 6.2 8.9 8.5 20.6 22. 3.7 3.5 11.7 4.9 6.7 8.5 5.5 8.7 9.4 16.9 14.3 14.5 10.9 10.5 12.3 2.8 2.9 3.4 4.2 3.4 4.5 4.4 1.9 5.2 3.7 46.8 23.5 28.5 17.7 20.3 27.7 27.1 36.6 26.7 30.4 17.3 17.6 12.2 13.2 15.3 17.7 17.5 20.2 17.3 18.4 5.4 11.7 14.9 17.2 16.9 13.5 13.8 13.9 14.3 14.0 8.7 10.6 11.3 13.7 6.8 10.8 10.5 14.6 13.2 12.6 1.9 1.6 2.2 3.7 0.0 3.0 2.7 2.1 3.1 2.6 15.4 31.3 27.6 31.5 35.6 23.1 24.0 10.8 21.3 18.7 4.5 3.7 3.3 2.9 5.1 4.2 4.3 1.8 4.0 3.3 8.5 6.5 6.8 5.7 6.8 7.5 7.4 4.6 2.5 5.3 14.4 18.0 15.2 14.0 25.4 10.4 11.6 13.2 4.9 10.6 14.2 8.0 13.3 12.9 6.8 13.5 13.0 13.0 9.2 12.1 8.3 5.5 5.8 3.8 1.7 5.5 5.2 5.8 11.0 6.8 13.7 12.7 14.1 10.6 18.6 16.2 16.4 20.0 13.7 17.0 4.5 1.0 2.9 2.1 0.0 5.2 4.8 6.0 3.4 4.9 6.4 5.3 7.0 9.0 5.1 6.3 6.2 8.4 6.1 6.9 5.7 3.5 5.7 5.6 1.7 5.1 4.8 5.5 4.7 5.0 12.3 26.0 17.5 21.1 15.3 12.8 13.0 10.6 8.1 11.0 0.2 Field groupings may differ from those in reports published by federal sponsors of the Survey of Earned Doctorates.

(Note: Changes in the OMB guidelines prompted the moving of persons having origins in the Indian subcontinent from the white category to the Asian category.) In 1980 the item was further revised in two ways: (1) the Hispanic category was subdivided into Puerto Rican, Mexican American, and other Hispanic to provide more detail for users of the racial/ethnic data, and (2) respondents were asked to check only one racial category. (Before 1980 doctorate recipients could check more than one category to indicate their race.) The item was modified again in 1982 to separate the questions on race and ethnicity. Since then respondents have been asked to first check one of the four racial group categories (American Indian, Asian, black, or white) and then indicate whether or not they are Hispanic.

The rate for 1996 may increase slightly in the next year if additional questionnaires are received after survey closure. Self-report rates for 1980-1996 are determined from the \"source of response\" indicator in the doctorate records. Because this indicator was not coded prior to 1980, survey forms for 1965-1979 are assumed to be self-reported if \"month signed\" or \"marital status\" is present. \"Marital status\" is not available from sources other than the doctorate recipient."}, {"section_title": "AL", "text": "As shown above, 92.8 percent of all doctorate recipients in 1996 completed survey forms; this percentage is referred to as the \"self-report\" rate. For the remaining 7.2 percent of recipients, \"skeletal\" forms were created with information from doctorate-granting institutions or commencement programs. Whether or not individuals completed the survey questionnaire, the following four data items are available for all recipients: gender, Ph.D. institution, Ph.D. field, and Ph.D. year. This report presents data obtained from all survey forms, both self-reported and skeletal. Readers should note that nonresponse in a tabulation varies according to the combination of selected variables. Higher nonresponse rates occur when any of the four variables mentioned above are cross-tabulated with another variable (e.g., educational debt) because the universe consists of the entire doctoral cohort. In other words, the 7.2 percent of Ph.D.s who did not respond to the survey are included even though their records contain minimal information. Nonresponse is generally lower when citizenship or race/ethnicity is cross-tabulated with a variable such as debt because the population is restricted to a group (e.g., U.S. citizens) that is largely drawn from self-reported forms 108 100 and thus more likely to have responses to the debt question. To be more precise, information on debt was not available for only 5.7 percent of U.S. citizens in 1996; nonresponse was low because data on both citizenship and debt were obtained mostly from self-reported forms. Nonresponse was higher for the entire 1996 cohort (8.9 percent) because it included the 7.2 percent of forms that were only partially filled in by institutions or staff of the National Research Council. The same was true for men (9.1 percent) and women (8.5 percent) because gender was known even for Ph.D.s who did not complete a survey form. Cross-tabulating debt with field of doctorate would yield similarly high nonresponse rates because Ph.D. field is available for all recipients. The percentages shown in the tables and figures in the body of this report are based only on the number of doctorate recipients who responded to the applicable survey questions.' Appendix C presents nonresponse rates for the variables included in these tables and figures; it also provides descriptive explanations of the data as needed.

Because Ph.D.s sometimes complete the survey form months ahead of graduation, it is not possible to determine the final plans of all recipients. It is quite likely that some individuals who check \"negotiating\" or \"seeking\" have obtained positions by the time of graduation. Tables 20 and 21 compare the proportion of Ph.D.s with \"definite\" plans and those still \"seeking.\" Other data on postgraduation plans in this report are restricted to the group of Ph.D.s who reported \"definite\" plans.2 Definite commitments: Tables 22 through 27 include only those Ph.D.s who reported definite postgraduation commitments and therefore do not reflect the entire Ph.D. population. Postdoctoral location: Revisions to the survey form have resulted in significant increases in response rates for postdoctoral location during the past few years. Doctorate recipients can now check a box for \"U.S.\" or \"non-U.S.\" instead of providing the name and exact location of the organization with which they will be affiliated after the doctorate.
