[{"section_title": "Actual and projected growth", "text": "in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) economy has led to an emphasis on STEM education as a strategy for increasing the supply of STEM workers (Atkinson and Mayo 2010). Between 2005 and 2015, employment in STEM occupations grew faster than in non-STEM occupations. In 2015, approximately 6 percent of all U.S. workers were in STEM occupations (Noonan 2017). Additionally, job openings in STEM and health care are projected to grow the fastest among occupational clusters (Carnevale, Smith, and Strohl 2013). Because of the anticipated demand for STEM occupations, researchers and policymakers have been studying and trying to address attrition from STEM fields as students move through the education pipeline (Metcalf 2010). For example, 48 percent of bachelor's degree students who declared a STEM major left their initially chosen STEM major within 6 years of entering postsecondary education (Chen 2013). Attrition from STEM majors at the postsecondary level is associated with academic performance, coursetaking patterns, and the sex and race/ethnicity of students (Chen 2013). To increase the supply of students interested in STEM fields at the postsecondary level, educators and policymakers have focused on increasing student interest and engagement in K-12 STEM education. Previous reports from the U.S. Department of Education's NCES within the Institute of Education Sciences have presented findings regarding postsecondary majors, STEM participation, and 2013 change in college major (Chen 2013;Leu 2017). While such postsecondary information is critical, information on high school students' changing occupational intentions can also provide insights into their postsecondary choices. Many studies have examined the relationship between student characteristics and STEM interest, occupations, and coursetaking. Using a nationally representative sample of over 6,000 students to examine how interest in STEM fields changed throughout high school, Sadler et al. (2012) found that female interest in STEM decreased by the end of high school, while male interest remained relatively stable. In general, females are less likely than males to be interested in a STEM major (Chen 2009;Moakler and Kim 2014). Family members can influence students' academic and occupational pursuits (Oymack 2018). For example, having at least one parent in a STEM occupation is related to students' STEM career aspirations (Holmes et al. 2017). Additionally, parent attitudes during students' high school years and parents' expectations for the length of their children's education are related to success in a STEM major in postsecondary education (Hinojosa et al. 2016). Further, exposure to occupations of family members may influence students' expectations and intentions for future jobs (Hinojosa et al. 2016;Holmes et al. 2017). Using data from a cohort of 2009 high school freshmen, this brief presents data on occupational intentions of students and changes in intentions over the first 3 years of high school, as students are preparing to make decisions about postsecondary education. The brief includes information on student, family, and school-level factors associated with changes in STEM occupational intentions over time in high school. It also compares STEM coursetaking of students who consistently throughout high school intended later to be employed in a STEM field, students who never intended to be employed in a STEM field, and students who changed intentions during high school. This brief complements other studies by NCES that examine recruitment and retention of students in STEM fields during and after college (Chen 2013). It builds on the work of Mangu et al. (2015) who used the NCES High School Longitudinal Study of 2009 (HSLS:09) baseline and first follow-up data on students' declared occupational intentions in STEM fields to classify them as Intenders, Not intenders, Newcomers, or Leavers. Mangu et al.'s definition of STEM included health occupations. The definition of STEM fields used in this brief does not include health or health sciences. While the relationship between interest and intention for future careers and student, family, and school factors is complex, this report provides only simple descriptive statistics. It does not investigate more complex hypotheses, account for interrelationships among variables, or support causal inferences. The analyses are limited to considering one factor at a time, rather than looking at the patterns by gender and race/ethnicity or the pattern by gender and race/ethnicity by family background characteristics."}, {"section_title": "Data, Methods, and Structure of the Report", "text": "This Statistics in Brief presents data from the NCES HSLS:09. HSLS:09 is a longitudinal dataset that is nationally representative of high school freshmen in the United States in 2009. Students who participated in the HSLS:09 were followed through 2016, with intermediate survey follow-ups in 2012 and 2013. The base-year data collection in 2009 included interviews with parents, students, and school staff. The analyses in this brief rely on multiple sources of information from HSLS:09. Student data are used to gauge STEM occupational intentions, interest in mathematics and science, engagement in school, academic performance, and coursetaking. Parent information is used to establish parents' highest level of educational attainment and parent STEM occupation. Students were asked, \"As things stand now, what is the job or occupation that you expect or plan to have at age 30?\" Their responses were coded on the data file into the corresponding 6-digit Occupational Information Network (O*NET) codes and then into the following categories: not a STEM occupation; life and physical science, engineering, mathematics, and information technology occupations; and health occupations. Overall, 71 percent of students (approximately 15,000) had responses to the questions about job or occupational expectations at both time points, 2009 and 2012. This brief provides information about the students in the fall of their ninthgrade year in 2009 and again from the spring of 2012, when most were in 11th grade. It defines STEM as life and physical science, engineering, mathematics, and information technology. This definition of STEM has been used in previous NCES reports. Reports using this definition of STEM have covered topics such as STEM degree outcomes, students who major in STEM, and attrition in STEM within postsecondary education (Chen 2009;Chen 2013;Hinz and Chen 2018)."}, {"section_title": "Background Information", "text": "At some point in high school, 14 percent of students expected or planned to have a job at age 30 that could be classified as STEM (figure 1). The distribution of occupational intentions at age 30 was similar in both the 2009 and 2012 survey follow-up, but there were changes within occupational intention categories. Some of the students who reported intentions for a STEM occupation at age 30 in 2009 reported intentions for an occupation in a field other than STEM in 2012. Likewise, some of the students who reported intentions for a job in a field other than STEM in 2009 reported intentions for a STEM occupation in 2012. Health occupations and health science are considered non-STEM fields in this brief. The analyses presented throughout the brief use the following four categories of STEM occupational intentions: STEM Intenders, STEM Newcomers, STEM Leavers, and Non-STEM Intenders (figure 2). STEM Intenders are students who, as high school freshmen in 2009, expected to be in a STEM occupational field at age 30 and maintained that intention when surveyed again in 2012. STEM Intenders represent 3 percent of the population. STEM Intenders include those who changed from one STEM career to another within STEM. STEM Newcomers are students who, as high school freshmen in 2009, expected to be in a non-STEM occupational field at age 30 but in 2012 changed their occupational expectation to a STEM field. STEM Newcomers represent 5 percent of the population. STEM Leavers are students who, as high school freshmen in 2009, expected to be in a STEM occupational field at age 30 but in 2012 changed their occupational expectation to a non-STEM field. STEM Leavers represent 6 percent of the population. Non-STEM Intenders are students who, as high school freshmen in 2009, expected to be in an occupation in a field other than STEM, and in 2012 reported expectations for an occupation in a field other than STEM at age 30. Non-STEM Intenders represent 86 percent of the population.  \u2022 Among STEM Intenders, a higher percentage were male (77 percent) than female (23 percent). Among Non-STEM Intenders, a higher percentage were female (54 percent) than male (46 percent) (figure 3). \u2022 A higher percentage of STEM Intenders than Non-STEM Intenders were White (60 percent compared to 51 percent), and a lower percentage were Black (9 percent compared to 14 percent) (figure 4). \u2022 Among STEM Intenders, STEM Newcomers, and STEM Leavers, a higher percentage had a parent whose highest degree was an associate's or bachelor's degree compared to all students (45 percent compared to 39 percent) (figure 5). \u2022 A higher percentage of STEM Intenders compared to Non-STEM Intenders had a parent with an occupation in a STEM field (18 percent compared to 9 percent) (figure 6). \u2022 A higher percentage of STEM Intenders compared to Non-STEM Intenders took a mathematics course higher than algebra I by the end of ninth grade (57 percent compared to 34 percent) (figure 7). \u2022 A higher percentage of STEM Intenders compared to Non-STEM Intenders were on an academic track (55 percent compared to 34 percent) (figure 8). Approximately half of 2009 ninthgraders in 2012 were male and half were female, but 77 percent of STEM Intenders were male and 23 percent were female. Similar to STEM Intenders, 78 percent of STEM Newcomers were male and 22 percent were female (figure 3). While a small percentage of ninthgraders reported intentions to pursue STEM, there was significant variation by race/ethnicity (figure 4). Approximately half of the fall 2009 ninth-graders in spring 2012 were White (52 percent), 14 percent were Black, 22 percent were Hispanic, 4 percent were Asian, and 9 percent were Other/Two or more races. By comparison, the racial/ethnic distribution of STEM Intenders was 60 percent White, 9 percent Black, 14 percent Hispanic, 5 percent Asian, and 12 percent Other/Two or more races.

Overall, approximately 10 percent of students had at least one parent in a STEM field when the student was in ninth grade. Compared to Non-STEM Intenders (9 percent), a higher percentage of STEM Intenders, STEM Newcomers, and STEM Leavers had at least one parent in a STEM field (18 percent, 13 percent, and 13 percent, respectively). A higher percentage of STEM Intenders (38 percent) than STEM Leavers (28 percent) or Non-STEM Intenders (24 percent) had family income greater than $95,000.

For example, there were not statistically significant differences between public and private school students in the rate of STEM Intenders, STEM Newcomers, or STEM Leavers. Looking at urbanicity, a lower percentage of STEM Intenders (17 percent) attended rural schools compared to Non-STEM Intenders (23 percent) and STEM Leavers (26 percent). There were not statistically significant differences in rates of STEM Intenders or other occupational intention categories in schools classified as city, suburb, or town (table A-1)."}, {"section_title": "3", "text": "Which mathematics and science courses students take in ninth grade can lead them down different pathways. Algebra I is a prerequisite for higher level mathematics and science courses. Early or late completion of algebra I could lead a student to different college majors or career paths. A higher percentage of STEM Intenders than Non-STEM Intenders took a math course higher than algebra I by the end of ninth grade (57 percent compared to 34 percent) (figure 7). Many higher paying occupationsboth STEM and non-STEM-require college degrees. According to the National Science Board (2019), \"S&E [science and engineering] occupations\"-defined as life science, computer and mathematical science, physical science, social science, and engineering-are generally assumed to require at least a bachelor's degree in an S&E field. Pursuing an academic track in high school can help ensure students' access to postsecondary education. Students with interests and intentions outside of STEM fields may intend to pursue postsecondary education and take courses on an academic track. To be on an academic track, a student must earn four credits in English, three credits in math with one higher than algebra II, three credits in science with one higher than biology, three credits in social studies with one in U.S. or world history, and two credits in one foreign language. A higher percentage of STEM Intenders than Non-STEM Intenders were on an academic track (55 percent compared to 34 percent) (figure 8). In addition to differences between STEM Intenders and Non-STEM Intenders in courses taken and being on an academic track, there were also differences in their overall high school GPA scores. A higher percentage of STEM Intenders (74 percent) than STEM Newcomers (58 percent), STEM Leavers (55 percent), and Non-STEM Intenders (50 percent) had GPAs between 3.0 and 4.0 (figure 9). Students on an academic track must earn four credits in English, three credits in math with one higher than algebra II, three credits in science with one higher than biology, three credits in social studies with one in U.S. or world history, and two credits in one foreign language.

The estimates provided in this Statistics in Brief are based on data collected in the base year (fall 2009), first follow-up study (spring 2012), and 2013 update (2013) of the HSLS:09. The HSLS:09 base year and first follow-up study included a student questionnaire, and questionnaires administered to students' parents, school counselors, and school administrators. The student questionnaire collected information such as expectations and aspirations; high school interests; grade progression; and demographics and family background. The 2013 update collected information on high school completion and postsecondary plans. High school transcripts were also collected. The update did not include new information about students' STEM occupational intentions. In the base-year HSLS:09, students were sampled through a two-stage process: schools were sampled first, followed by students within schools. The target population at the school level was defined as regular public schools (including public charter schools) and private schools in the 50 states and the District of Columbia that provided instruction in both ninth and eleventh grades. Stratified random sampling based on school type (public, private-Catholic, private-other), geographic region (Northeast, Midwest, South, West), and geographic location of the school (city, suburban, town, rural) resulted in the identification of 1,889 eligible schools. A total of 944 of these schools participated in the study, resulting in a 55 percent weighted response rate, or 50 percent unweighted response rate. In the second stage of sampling, students were randomly selected using a stratified systematic sampling procedure from baseyear enrollment lists provided by administrative contacts at the school. The second-stage sampling strata were defined by the students' race/ethnicity (White, Black, Hispanic, Asian, Other) specified by the school, yielding approximately 26,300 sampled students (or about 28 students per school). The target population of students was defined to include all ninth-grade students who attended the studyeligible schools in the fall 2009 term. Students who were unable to directly participate in the study because of language barriers or severe disabilities were retained in the sample, and contextual data were sought for them. Their ability to complete the study instruments was reassessed in the first follow-up. Of the 26,300 sampled students, all 25,200 base-year, studyeligible students were eligible to participate in the assessment, with the exception of a few cases in which students passed away or were found to not have been in ninth grade during the base year. (Two exceptions to this are sample members who died or were removed as a result of base-year sampling errors discovered only in the first follow-up; e.g., the student was not a ninth-grader in 2009.) Approximately 20,600 students participated in the assessment, resulting in a weighted studentlevel response rate of 82 percent. Unlike prior NCES secondary studies, the HSLS:09 student sample was not freshened to include a representative later-grade cohort. As a result, first follow-up estimates from the sample are associated only with the ninth-grade cohort 2.5 years later and not the universe of students attending the eleventh grade in the spring of 2012. Two broad categories of error occur in estimates generated from surveys: sampling and nonsampling errors. Sampling errors occur when observations are based on samples rather than on entire populations. The standard error of a sample statistic is a measure of the variation due to sampling and indicates the precision of the statistic, that is, how close to the population value the estimated statistic is likely to be. The complex sampling designs used in HSLS:09 must be taken into account when calculating such variance estimates as standard errors. The variance for the estimates in this Statistics in Brief was calculated using balanced repeated replication to accommodate the complex sample design. Nonsampling error can be attributed to several sources: incomplete information about all respondents (e.g., some students or schools refused to participate or students participated but answered only certain items); differences among respondents in question interpretation; mistakes in recording or coding data; and other errors in collecting, processing, and imputing missing data. Standard quality-control procedures were followed in the HSLS:09 data collection process in order to minimize nonsampling errors.

For this brief, this requirement pertains to unit response rates-the percentage of students completing the student questionnaire-and item response rates for each of the questionnaire items used in this analysis. The overall student response rates for the fall 2009, spring 2012, and 2013 Update student questionnaires were 86 percent, 82 percent, and 79 percent, respectively. The unit weighted response rate for students with response in the 2013 Update, base year, and first follow-up was 62.5 percent. A total of 18 variables were used for the student base-year to first followup to 2013 Update longitudinal unit nonresponse bias analysis. These 18 variables resulted in 67 comparisons (tests). Bias was detected for 41.8 percent of the 67 tests implemented with the student base-year to first follow-up to 2013 Update longitudinal weight (W3W1W2STU). After applying the nonresponse adjustments, no bias was statistically significant in any of the 67 tests. Details are available in Ingels et al. 2015. Estimates in this brief were weighted to adjust for the unequal probability of selection and enable the production of national estimates. Because this brief uses variables from the base year, first follow-up, and 2013 Update, the student weight, W3W1W2STU, was used to account for base-year school nonresponse and student nonresponse in the base year, first follow-up, and 2013 Update.
