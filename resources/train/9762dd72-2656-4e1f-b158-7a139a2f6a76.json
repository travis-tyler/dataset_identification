[{"section_title": "Fabrication and Characterization of the Paper-Based Electrochemical\nPlatform ::: Results and Discussion", "text": "The central theme of this study is schematically shown in Figure 1a, which depicts a\ngraphene-based electrochemical platform for selective and\nultrasensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA by exploiting high\nspecific ssDNA-capped gold nanoparticles as the sensing element.\nAlthough the graphene-based electrochemical platform has been quite\nexplored in the past decade, the design of an electrochemical sensor\nbased on the antisense oligonucleotides targeted specifically toward\nthe rapid, selective, ultrasensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA\nhas not yet been explored. Further, introducing the ssDNA-capped gold\nnanoparticles to the electrochemical sensing platform made the current\ntechnology quite eligible to sense the viral RNA without any gene\namplification step with a reasonably lower detection limit compared\nwith other conventional methods.\nThe current pandemic situation demands the need for the development of a\nlow-cost POC sensor that can diagnose positive COVID-19 cases with\nhigh accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity without the need for\nspecialized chemicals, complex fabrication procedures, and\nsophisticated equipment. In this regard, we employed simple two-step\nprocedures to develop a paper-based electrical sensor chip that can\ndiagnose positive COVID-19 cases within a few minutes without the need\nfor further gene amplification procedures. A graphene suspension was\nfirst coated on filter paper to form a conductive film followed by the\ndeposition of a Au electrode with a predefined design. A schematic of\nthis biosensor construct is shown in Figure 1a. Graphene nanoplatelets (GR) provide\nthe advantage of preventing the formation of a water-tight composite\non the sensor chip, thereby giving an edge-over-edge configuration of\nthe film at the microscopic level.31 The high\ncarrier mobility (>2000 cm2 V s\u20131) of\ngraphene also makes it highly sensitive to the interaction and\nadsorption of the charged target at its surface. Figure 1b depicts the dark-field image\nof the graphene film with the AuNPs in the absence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA.\nThe photograph of the developed chip is shown in Figure 1c. Figure\n1d,e show the scanning electron\nmicroscopic (SEM) image of the sensor chip, which shows both the\nedge-over-edge microscopic configuration of the graphene nanoplatelets\nand the pattern of gold electrodes. The electrochemical sensor thus\nutilizes a paper base coated with a thin graphene conductive film and\ncarefully designed gold electrode. The graphene film plays an\nimportant role in the sensing response. To optimize the graphene film,\nthe concentration of the graphene suspension used for making the\ngraphene film has been varied and the resistance of the graphene film\non the filter paper was measured directly. Three different\nconcentrations of graphene platelets\n(i.e., 5, 10, and 20 mg/mL)\nhave been used to make three graphene films using the same procedure\nas described in the Experimental Section. A\nthick and viscous suspension was formed while utilizing a graphene\nconcentration of 20 mg/mL, which makes it difficult to form a\nuniformly coated surface. On the other hand, the texture of the\nsuspension having a concentration of 10 or 5 mg/mL was reasonable to\nuniformly coat the filter paper surface. Figure S1 illustrates the\nV\u2013I response of the\ngraphene film made from two different graphene concentrations. The 5\nmg/mL film showed a nonlinear\nV\u2013I response\n(R2 = 0.28)\u2014not obeying\nOhm\u2019s law\u2014and very low response when compared to the\nfilm made from the 10 mg/mL suspension. Moreover, the 10 mg/mL film\nshows a linear V\u2013I response\n(R2 = 0.99) and with a base\nresistance of 272.4 ohms. Therefore, the graphene film from a 10 mg/mL\nsuspension has been used to make the sensor chip, which was used\nthroughout this work.\nRecently, nanoparticles have shown their promise in improving the sensing\nand recognition performance of SARS-CoV-2.43\u221248 Accordingly, we used gold nanoparticles to\nincrease the sensitivity of our electrochemical platform due to their\nexcellent unmatched properties.49\u221251 Citrate-stabilized\nAuNPs of 10 \u00b1 5 nm in size were synthesized using a previous\nliterature report52 and used in the electrochemical\nsensor chip. Transmission electron microscopy images of the\nas-synthesized gold nanoparticles revealed the anhydrate particle\ndiameter (Figure S2). The hydrodynamic diameter of the\ncitrate-stabilized nanoparticles was found to be 44.7 \u00b1 5.9 nm,\nand the zeta potential measurement revealed the colloidal stability of\nthese particles with \u03b6 = \u221250.24 \u00b1 6.07 mV. To\nachieve selectivity and sensitivity during the recognition of\nSARS-CoV-2 genetic material, we used ssDNA\u2014known as probes\nthroughout the article\u2014capped AuNPs, which were then deposited\non the surface of the sensor platform. Raman spectra have been\ncollected to further characterize the sensor chip. The plain sensor\nshows a high\nIG/ID\nratio in the presence of the gold electrode compared to the absence of\nit, with a higher 2D peak in the graphene region (Figure 1f,g), confirming the successful\nmounting of the gold electrodes on top of the graphene film. Further,\nit can be seen from the Raman spectral analysis that the graphene base\nprovides a graphitic (sp2) to diamond (sp3)\nintensity ratio\n(IG/ID)\nof 1.74, while the sensor immobilized with the ssDNA-capped gold\nnanoparticle has an\nIG/ID\nvalue of 1.56 (Figure 1e,h).\nThis decrease in\nIG/ID\nvalue can be attributed to the surface-enhanced Raman scattering\n(SERS) caused by the presence of the AuNPs on gold electrodes.\nFurthermore, the graphitic wavenumber is also downshifted from 1584 to\n1581 cm\u20131, which indicates the increased\n\u03c0\u2013\u03c0 interactions between the oligonucleotide\n(ssDNA) and graphene.17,53,54 Once\nthe viral sample encounters the sensor, viral RNA hybridizes with the\nAuNP-capped ssDNA, allowing a more accurate electrochemical\nmeasurement. The ssDNA probes have been designed based on a previous\nreport from our research group43 and are described\nin the following section."}, {"section_title": "Strategic Design of the Antisense Oligonucleotide, ssDNA, Probes for\nTargeting SARS-CoV-2 Viral RNA ::: Results and Discussion", "text": "Three regions among the SARS-CoV-2-related viral genomes have been\nidentified as the conserved sequences among which an assay targeting\nthe N-gene (nucleocapsid phosphoprotein) has recently been recommended\nas a screening test to determine positive COVID-19 cases.12 Scientists are therefore continually trying to\nease the screening protocol for the N-gene due to the current upsurge\nof test kits\u2019 requirement to selectively identify and\nquarantine SARS-CoV-2-infected personnel.12,55 We,\ntherefore, thought of a simple paper-based gold nanoparticle-mediated\nelectrochemical assay to easily and quickly detect the presence of the\nSARS-CoV-2 N-gene from an infected RNA sample. The methodology\ndescribed herein utilizes a multimodal approach that simultaneously\ntargets two separate regions of the N-gene at the same time using four\ndifferent suitably functionalized gold nanoparticles (Figure 2a\u2212c). These AuNPs were\nindividually capped with four of the carefully designed antisense\noligonucleotides (ssDNA probes). Nevertheless, this strategy is\nsupposed to increase the reliability and feasibility of the\nelectrochemical assay even if there is a mutation in the viral gene\nduring its cross-transmission because of its multimodal approach of\ntargeting the viral genome. This electrochemical assay is therefore\nbelieved to enhance the analytical sensitivity of the N-gene.\nIn order to design ssDNA probes selective for SARS-CoV-2, the genome\nsequence of SARS-CoV-2 isolate 2019-nCoV/USA-WA1-A12/2020 was\nconsidered and its N-gene was undertaken for the prediction of a set\nof antisense oligonucleotide probes as described in the Materials and Methods section. The target\nbinding energies and binding disruption energies of the predicted\nprobes were compared, and the ones with the optimum energies have been\nselected (Figure 2e and\nTable S1). One other criterion behind the selection\nof these four probes is their relatively close target positions. The\nantisense probe, P1, targets the N-gene sequence 421\u2013440,\nwhereas P2 targets the sequence 443\u2013462. On the other hand, P3\ntargets the sequence position 836\u2013855, whereas antisense P4\ntargets the 886\u2013905 position of the N-gene. The ssDNA probes\nwere then functionalized differentially: 5\u2032 ends of P1 and P3\nwere modified and 3\u2032 ends of P2 and P4 were altered with thiol\nmoieties having a six-carbon spacer (Figure 2d). These ssDNA probes were then used\nto cap gold nanoparticles and loaded over the gold electrode to\naccelerate the electron transfer followed by enhancement in the\nelectrochemical response of graphene toward the selective detection of\nSARS-CoV-2. The successful surface capping of AuNPs with ssDNA probes\nwas confirmed from their relative change in the UV\u2013vis\nabsorbance spectrum (Figure S3), the change of the electrophoretic\nmobility in agarose gel electrophoresis (Figure S4). Citrate-capped AuNPs without any DNA\nbarely migrated, whereas the ssDNA-capped AuNPs migrated\ndifferentially plausibly due to their differential surface\nfunctionalization with ssDNA probes. The differential electrophoretic\nmobility of the gold nanoparticles indicated the differential surface\ncharge associated with the nanoparticles.56,57 It can\ntherefore be inferred that more ssDNA functionalization will lead to a\nmore surface negative charge and hence more electrophoretic mobility.\nThus, it can be said that the ssDNA functionalization is more for\nAu-P3H, followed by Au-P4M,\nAu-P1M, and Au-P2L."}, {"section_title": "Signal Amplification Using Gold Nanoparticles Capped with ssDNA Probes\nand the Optimization of Probes/AuNPs Ratio and AuNP Size ::: Results and Discussion", "text": "The designed antisense oligonucleotides can be incorporated on the sensor\nchip in two different configurations, as shown in Figure 3a. The antisense probes can be\nconjugated directly to the gold electrode surface (configuration 1) or\ncan be utilized to cap the surface of gold nanoparticles, which will\nthen be deposited at the surface of the sensor platform (configuration\n2). Figure 3b shows the\nsensors response after the addition of 5.854 \u00d7 107 of\nSARS-CoV-2 viral RNA. Configuration 1\u2014antisense\noligonucleotides were thiolated on the gold electrode\u2014provides\na low response signal compared to the configuration 2. The sensor\nresponse to the SARS-CoV-2 RNA in configuration 2 was found to be\nsignificantly higher (p < 0.001) compared to the\nresponse in configuration 1 (Figure 3c). This significant increase in electrical signal in\nthe presence of AuNPs\u2014configuration 2\u2014may also be\nattributed to the increased reactivity of the ssDNA probes when capped\non AuNPs and deposited over the electrode surface, favoring the\nelectron transfer kinetics and also because the AuNPs provided a high\nsurface area for the interaction of ssDNA probes with the viral RNA,\neventually leading to signal amplification. On the other hand, the\nlower electrical responses observed for configuration 1 indicated\ndecreased conductive pathways for electron transfer. Further, AuNPs,\ndue to their excellent conductive\ncharacteristics,58\u221262 contribute to these conduction pathways by\naccelerating the electron transfer, leading to the increased output\nsignal in the presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA. Therefore, the sensor\nwith configuration 2, consisting of antisense oligonucleotide-capped\nAuNPs deposited over the gold electrode, has been used for all our\nfuture electrochemical studies.\nThe sensitivity of the sensor is highly dependent on the recognition\nelement (i.e., antisense oligonucleotide). The\ndensity of the ssDNA probe immobilized on the sensor surface is an\nessential factor affecting the sensitivity and is anticipated to play\na role in the sensor response.63 The developed\nplatform can thus be represented by a resistive sensor model in which\nthe change in the voltage across the sensor chip is given\nby1where \u0394V is\nthe change in the voltage across the sensor chip, R\nis the resistance, and q is the charge.\nWe have used the Langmuir model to fit the kinetics of binding as in the\nsurface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments in which this model has\nbeen widely explored at high flow speeds.64,65 The\ndissociation to the formation of the binding complex RNA\u2013DNA\nwith an immobilized ssDNA probe (D) at the end of the injunction can\nbe given\nby2where\n[RD]t is the surface density of the\nbinding complex between the viral RNA and antisense ssDNA, [R] is the\nconcentration of the target RNA, and kd is\nthe dissociation rate constant.\nEquation 2 is a first-order\nequation that can be solved analytically to provide eq\n3:3where ka\nis the association rate constant and [D]max is the maximum\nnumber of ssDNA probes available for binding per surface area.\nThe change in the surface charges (\u0394q) can be\nrepresented by\nQRNAS[RD]t,66 where QRNA is the\nelectric charge caused by the adsorbed RNA unit to the sensor chip per\nsurface density, and S is the graphene surface area.\nThen, eq 1 can be written\nas45\nThus, from eq 5, it may be\npresumed that maximum response will be obtained from an immobilized\ndensity of the maximum number of ssDNA probes, [D]max.\nBased on eq 5, a higher\nresponse level is thus anticipated when more antisense ssDNA probes\nare immobilized on the surface. However, the hybridization kinetics of\nthe ssDNA probes with their complementary target can be significantly\naltered when high densities of ssDNA probes are immobilized. High\nssDNA probe density may lead to slower response time or nonlinear\nsensor response due to the unnecessarily complicated binding behavior,\nwhich rises at high probe density.66 Several\nexperiments have, therefore, been conducted using the electrochemical\nchip to find the optimum concentration of the ssDNA probe. Three\ndifferent concentrations of each of the four ssDNA probes\n(i.e., P1, P2, P3, and P4)\nwere used to cap the AuNPs, and the corresponding electrical\nperformances of the sensors were investigated with a fixed\nconcentration of the viral SARS-CoV-2 RNA load. The three different\nconcentrations were designated as high (H), moderate (M), and low (L)\nlevel, which is equivalent to 0.5, 1, and 2 \u03bcM of the ssDNA,\nrespectively (see the Experimental Section for\nmore details).\nFigure 4a illustrates the\nelectrochemical sensor response for each of the AuNPs functionalized\nwith ssDNA probes toward the viral RNA at three different probes/AuNPs\nratio. The moderate ratio of P1 (Au-P1M) exhibits the\nhighest change in the signal output, whereas the lowest ratio of P2\n(Au-P2L) was found to be the optimum concentration\nfor this probe, which shows the highest change in the sensor output\ncompared to other concentrations. On the other hand, the highest ratio\nof P3 (Au-P3H) was found to be the optimum, and finally,\nthe moderate ratio of P4 (Au-P4M) provided the best\nperformance. The nanoparticle tracking analysis using ZetaView\nfollowed a similar trend in which the increase in hydrodynamic\ndiameter after the addition of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA load was found to\nbe the highest for moderate P1 (Au-P1M), low P2\n(Au-P2L), high P3 (Au-P3H), and moderate\nP4 (Au-P4M) (Figure S5). These constructs, Au-P1M,\nAu-P2L, Au-P3H, and Au-P4M,\nwere then considered to build a sensitive platform for the selective\nrecognition of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA. The average number of ssDNA\nprobes conjugated to each AuNP has been quantified and found to be\n6.05, 5.05, 29.8, and 20.12 for Au-P1M, Au-P2L,\nAu-P3H, and Au-P4M, respectively.\nAccordingly, all the four probes\n(i.e., Au-P1M,\nAu-P2L, Au-P3H, and Au-P4M)\nwere mixed (Au-Pmix) in an equivalent amount with each\nother to further improve the DNA\u2013RNA hybridization propensity\n(Figure S6) and enhance the analytical sensitivity of\nthe electrochemical sensor toward the selective detection of\nSARS-CoV-2 viral RNA (Figure 4a).\nTo evaluate the effect of the gold nanoparticles\u2019 size on the\nsensor performance, two additional gold nanoparticles with sizes of 50\n\u00b1 5 nm and 100 \u00b1 10 nm have been tested in addition to the\noriginal size (10 \u00b1 5 nm). Each gold nanoparticle has been capped\nwith one of the four ssDNA probes based on the previous optimum value\n(i.e., Au-P1M,\nAu-P2L, Au-P3H, and Au-P4M). An\nequal amount of each AuXnm-PX was mixed to make\nAuXnm-Pmix and used to make the sensor\nchip by depositing the mixture on the sensor surface. The response\ntoward 106 copies/\u03bcL of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA has been\nrecorded from the sensor chip with Au10nm-Pmix,\nAu50nm-Pmix, and\nAu100nm-Pmix. Figure S7 shows that the 10 nm AuNPs exhibit the\noptimum response compared to the other nanoparticles, 50 and 100 nm in\nsize. It was apparent that larger nanoparticles at sub-nanometer gaps\nhave lower DNA density, in which the DNA density is higher for the\nsmall particles and decreases as the nanoparticle size\nincreases.67 Accordingly, we have received a\nbetter response from the smaller sized gold nanoparticles than the\nlarger ones. Further studies are required to fully understand the\neffect of the size on the sensor response, which is beyond the scope\nof this first report.\nTo further confirm the exceptional affinity of the ssDNA probes to the\ntarget segment in the viral RNA, an advanced instrumental technique\nsuch as hyperspectral spectroscopy was used.43\nHyperspectral imaging (HSI) is a label-free detection technique that\ncan be used to confine a nanomaterial based on its hyperspectral\nsignature by combining the power of both imaging and\nspectrophotometry.68,69 The HSI system is\nbased on the enhanced dark-field microscopic (EDFM) advanced optics\ncombined with a computational algorithm used to capture a spectrum in\nthe range of 400 to 1000 nm at each pixel of the image. Each\nindividual material exhibits a spectrum signature here representing\nthe identity of the material of interest even in a blended sample.\nThus, the hyperspectral can be used to create an image\n\u201cmap\u201d to localize the material of interest in the tested\nsample. Therefore, EDFM-HSI mapping has widely been confirmed to\naccurately localize and identify the nanomaterials in samples more\nefficiently compared to the other conventional\napproaches.70,71 To this end, the\nelectrochemical chip\u2014as described before\u2014was prepared on\na glass slide and investigated under a hyperspectral imaging\nmicroscope to reveal the selectivity and efficient hybridization of\nthe ssDNA probes with the viral RNA at a microscopic level. A\nred-shift of \u223c150 nm was observed in the hyperspectral image\nfollowing the addition of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA to the\ngraphene-Au-Pmix-based platform (Figure 4b). Figure\n4c depicts the dark-field image of\nthe graphene-coated Au\u2013Pmix platform in the absence\nof viral RNA, whereas Figure 4d represents the dark-field image of the same platform\nafter the addition of the viral RNA. The shift in the spectral peaks\nafter the addition of the target RNA confirmed the successful\nhybridization of ssDNA probes with its complementary region in N-gene\nsequence within the electrochemical sensor chip.\nTo gain more insight about the localization and distribution of each\nssDNA probe-capped gold nanoparticles when bound to the viral RNA, the\nhyperspectral image mapping has been explored. Figure\n5 depicts the localization of\nAu-P1M, Au-P2L, Au-P3H, and\nAu-P4M within the graphene film before the addition\nof SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA. In the absence of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA, the Au\nprobes are found to be randomly distributed within the graphene film\n(Figure 5). However, in\nthe presence of the viral RNA, the Au probes are arranged where Au-P1\nand Au-P2 were found close to each other, and Au-P3 and Au-P4 were\nobserved to be in proximity (Figure 6), which supports the specific binding of the ssDNA\nprobe to its target. Figure S8 shows a zoomed-in image that illustrates\nthe adjacent Au-P1M and Au-P2L in the\nhyperspectral map in the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA, a trend that\ndoes not exist in the absence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. This can be explained\nbased on our design of the ssDNA probes, where P1 and P2 are targeting\ntwo consecutive regions in one segment of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA, whereas\nP3 and P4 are targeting another segment of the N-gene consecutively\n(Figure 2a). Further,\nit can be proposed that Au-P1 was found to be the most abundant,\nfollowed by Au-P4, Au-P3, and Au-P2 among the ssDNA probe-capped AuNPs\nwhile considering the zone where Au probes are accumulated in the\npresence of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA (Figure 6). This can be explained from the\ncomparative target RNA sequence binding energies and binding\ndisruption energies of the four different antisense oligonucleotides\n(Figure 2d).\nDark-field imaging further confirmed the sensitive and selective binding\nof SARS-CoV-2 by confirming the formation of a large cluster with\nAu\u2013Pmix (Figure S9). However, no obvious aggregate or\nformation of a large entity has been observed in the presence of\nMERS-CoV (Figure S10). The UV\u2013vis spectrum also\nconfirmed the sensitivity of the ssDNA-capped AuNPs to the SARS-CoV-2\nviral RNA (Figure S11).\nGold nanoparticles have been used extensively as a core element to\ndevelop many diagnostic assays.14,71 Gold nanoparticles\ncan be synthesized with controlled size, high reproducibility, and\nefficiency, making them an attractive candidate for diagnostic tests.\nIn this work, gold nanoparticles were deposited on the sensor chip\nsurface using the drop-casting method. To evaluate the effect of the\ngold nanoparticles\u2019 distribution on the sensor\u2019s\nanalytical performance, we assessed the variation in the sensor\nresponse to the same viral load using different sensors; the gold\nnanoparticles were randomly distributed on each of them. Gold\nnanoparticles were deposited on the surface of multiple sensor chips\nfrom which the deposition process was independent for each of them.\nThe response of seven sensor chips was recorded against an equal\nconcentration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA (\u223c1 \u00d7 105\ncopies/\u03bcL). No significant difference was observed between the\ndifferent sensors. The average response of the seven sensors was found\nto be 0.23, with a standard deviation of 0.02. These results indicated\nthat the variation in the AuNP distribution due to the deposition\nmethod had no obvious effect on the sensor performance (Figure S12)."}, {"section_title": "Real-Time Detection of SARS-CoV-2 Viral RNA ::: Results and Discussion", "text": "The aim of this work was to develop a POC sensor that is cost-effective\nand portable and can be integrated with smartphones for easy and rapid\ndiagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. To achieve this, we first eliminated the\ncomplex RNA amplification step using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)\nor reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and introduced the electrical\nsignal amplification from gold nanoparticles. Further, we eliminated\nthe need for the conventional techniques used for impedance\nrecordings, such as quartz crystal microbalance (QCM),\nelectrochemiluminescence (ECL), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and EIS, and\nreplaced them by a simple signal conditioning circuit, which was\nintegrated with a microcontroller and an algorithm for the computer\ninterface (Figure S13). The real-time recording of electrical\nsignals allowed the sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material\nin the RNA sample mediated by the optimized RNA\u2013DNA\nhybridization among the viral RNA and four of the selected Au probes.\nAs illustrated in Figure 1a,\nthe gold nanoparticles capped with ssDNA will be deposited on the\nsurface of the sensor chip by the drop-casting method. To this end,\nthe volume of Au-Px solution deposited on the surface\nhas been optimized to maintain the integrity and avoid the swelling\neffect of the sensor platform. Figure 7a depicts the SEM image of the sensor\nchip without the addition of any solution, Figure\n7b shows the surface after the\naddition of 10 \u03bcL of the solution, and Figure\n7c demonstrates the sensor surface\nafter the addition of 12 \u03bcL of solution. The sensor maintains\nits integrity up to 10 \u03bcL of the solution, whereas adding 2\n\u03bcL of extra solution led to obvious damage to the sensor surface\n(Figure 7c\u2013f)\nand swelling in the paper fibers; the paper fibers become visible in\nthe image. Figure S14 depicts the SEM images of fibers in the\nbare filter paper. In the sensor chip, the paper\u2019s fibers are\nhidden underneath the graphene layer (Figure 7a); the same holds true for the SEM\nimage of the sensor chip after the addition of 10 \u03bcL of the\nsolution (Figure 7b) where no\nobvious swelling signs, such as the appearance of thick fibers or\ndistortion of the graphene configuration, were observed. On the other\nhand, Figure 7c\u2013f\nshows a clear sign of paper swelling where the paper fibers become\nobvious and thicker, causing damage in the sensor chip at the\nmicroscopic level. Therefore, 10 \u03bcL is the optimum maximum\nvolume that can be added to the sensor chip while maintaining its\nintegrity. An 8 \u03bcL amount is found to be sufficient to cover the\nentire sensor electrode\u2014the circular electrode\u2014and this\nvolume has been adopted for making the sensors throughout this study,\nwith a total number of gold nanoparticles of 24 \u00d7 107\nparticles per sensor chip. A clinical sample of 2 \u03bcL volume has\nthen been added to ensure the total volume added to the sensor chip\ndid not exceed 10 \u03bcL.\nIt was expected that the ssDNA probes-capped AuNPs selectively bind with\nits target complementary SARS-CoV-2 RNA sequence and induce\naggregation depending on their closely following target sequence\npositions. In the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, the specific\nRNA\u2013DNA hybridization led to the change in charge and electron\nmobility on the graphene surface, which brought the change in sensor\noutput voltage. The change in the sensor electrical signal was\nobserved instantaneously, which reached stability within a short\nduration of time with an average response time of less than 5 min, as\nshown in Figure 8a. This\nillustrates a representative output signal of the sensor chip as a\nfunction of time after the addition of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA. The\nsensor is composed of a filter paper as a base material that has been\ncoated by graphene nanoplatelets to form a conductive film. The gold\nelectrode has been deposited on the surface of the graphene film as\nthe contact pad for the electrical readout. Finally, gold\nnanoparticles capped with ssDNA probes specific to the SARS-CoV-2 RNA\nhave been deposited on the sensor surface, which represents the\nrecognition element of the sensor. In the presence of the SARS-CoV-2\nRNA, the ssDNA mounted on the AuNPs\u2019 surface hybridized with\nits complementary target sequence on the surface of the graphene\nconductive film. The charges at the graphene\u2013solution interface\nincrease due to the hybridization of the viral RNA with the ssDNA\nsequence, which induces a variation in the graphene potential with a\npositive drift (eq 1). In order\nto eliminate the effect of the background noise, the change in the\nsensor output voltage was normalized to the sensor\u2019s initial\nvoltage. The time-series signal was recorded as a response to the\naddition of the viral RNA sample consisting two main parts, transient\nand steady-state response. The addition of the RNA sample at a certain\ntime point (t) represented a step input. The sensor\nexhibited a step response, which was represented by a sudden increase\nof the signal as a sharp peak (transient response). After some time,\nthe sensor reached a steady-state response, which reflected the\nresponse to the viral RNA concentrations. This increase in the sensor\nsignal after the addition of the sensor and following partial decrease\ncan be seen in the whole electrochemical platform since it represents\nboth the transient and the steady-state responses of the\nsensor.14\nTo further investigate the performance of the sensor, the dynamic\nresponse of the sensor, when deposited with Au-Pmix, was\nevaluated to various concentrations of viral RNA load extracted from\nVero cells infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Figure\n8b illustrates the linear response\n(standard curve) of the electrochemical biosensor with increasing\nconcentrations of viral RNA. This fully integrated device successfully\nexhibited a broad linear detection range from 585.4 copies/\u03bcL to\n5.854 \u00d7 107 copies/\u03bcL, with a sensitivity of 231\n(copies/\u03bcL)\u22121 for SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA.\nThe sensor sensitivity is referred to as the change in the sensor\noutput per unit change in the sensor input. The sensitivity, by\ndefinition, is the ratio of the measured output to the measured\nanalyte or target and can be calculated as the slope of the system\ntransfer function. In our case, the sensitivity is the ratio of the\nrelative change in the sensor voltage\n(\u0394V/V0) to\nSARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration (copies/\u03bcL), which has units of\n(copies/\u03bcL)\u22121 since\n\u0394V/V0 is\nunitless. One of the important sensor performances is the limit of\ndetection (LOD). The LOD represents the lowest amount of the target\nsubstrate that can be distinguished from its absence with a predefined\nconfidence level, usually 99%. The limit of detection is usually\ncalculated based on statistics from the blank measurement points and\nthe slope (analytical sensitivity, as we mentioned earlier) of the\nsensor standard curve. The limit of detection of the sensor chip has\nthus been calculated based on LOD =\n3.3SXY/slope and found to be 6.9\ncopies/\u03bcL. This significantly lower value of the LOD indicated\nthe improved sensitivity and superior analytical performance of the\ndesigned device. However, the pristine graphene-based device and the\ncitrate-stabilized AuNPs deposited on the graphene-based device did\nnot show any significant output signal change in the presence of the\nviral RNA load (Figure 8c).\nThese results supported the importance of ssDNA probes and their\nsensitivity toward the target SARS-CoV-2 viral N-gene. A control\nexperiment was further conducted to determine the selectivity of the\ndeveloped COVID-19 biosensor, where the sensor output signal was\nrecorded in the absence of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA and in the presence of\nMERS-CoV and SARS-CoV viral RNA load. The sensor, when deposited with\nAu-Pmix, showed no significant change in the output\nsignal toward either MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV RNA, demonstrating the\nselectivity of the device platform toward SARS-CoV-2 with no obvious\ncross-reactivity (Figure 8d)."}, {"section_title": "Selective Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in Clinical Samples ::: Results and Discussion", "text": "Finally, we evaluated the performance of the developed sensor chip in\ndetecting the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in clinical samples (Figure 9). Nasopharyngeal\nswab specimens have been collected from COVID-19 patients and healthy\nasymptomatic subjects and stored in viral transfer medium (VTM) for\nfuture use (Figure 9c). The\nresults were benchmarked with a gold standard SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic\nkit known as LabGun COVID-19 RT-PCR kit (FDA approved).72 Prior to testing of patient samples, we\ninvestigated the sensor response toward samples that were collected\nfrom healthy asymptomatic subjects, confirmed using RT-PCR. Figure 9a clearly shows that\nthe sensor responds to the positive COVID-19 confirmed samples\nselectively and demonstrated a significant increase in sensor voltage\ncompared to the negative samples. Thus, the sensor chip clearly\ndiscriminated between COVID-19 positive samples and healthy negative\nsamples in a rapid manner.\nThe sensor showed a negligible response toward the samples collected from\na healthy individual, while a high relative change in the sensor chip\nvoltage was observed for the positive COVID-19 confirmed clinical\nsamples (Figure 9b).\nMoreover, the sensor chip responded to COVID-19 positive samples with\ndifferent viral RNA loads of 1.9 \u00d7 107, 5.9 \u00d7\n106, and 5.9 \u00d7 105 (Figure 9d). Quantitative detection of\nthe viral RNA load using a simple sensor chip is also important in\nmonitoring the progression of SARS-CoV-2 infection after confirming\nthe disease after the onset of symptoms.73 To this\nend, we evaluated the ability of the developed sensor chip to quantify\nthe viral RNA load. The RNA concentration of the tested COVID-19\npositive clinical samples (i.e.,\nviral RNA load of 1.9 \u00d7 107, 5.9 \u00d7\n106, and 5.9 \u00d7 105) was estimated with high\naccuracy (Figure 9e), where\nthe RNA concentration of the clinical samples that were\nback-calculated from the standard curve was found to be highly\ncorrelated with the actual RNA concentration with Pearson\u2019s\ncorrelation of r = 0.999.\nFinally, the sensor response toward the collected clinical samples has\nbeen used to distinguish the positive COVID-19 samples from the\nnegative ones\u2014YES/NO answer\u2014using the thresholding\nprocess. The sensor response\u2014relative change in the sensor\nvoltage\n(\u0394V/V0)\u2014has\nbeen classified by applying a threshold value of 0.13, in which the\nsamples giving a response higher than the threshold are considered as\npositive, whereas the samples with a response lower than 0.13 are\nassigned as negative. Figure 10a illustrates the sensor chip response toward the 48\nclinical samples; the samples that belong to the negative group all\nshowed a response\n(\u0394V/V0) less\nthan 0.13. On the other hand, the samples that showed a response\nhigher than 0.13 belong to the COVID-19 positive group. Table S2 summarizes the amount of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in\neach clinical sample in copies/\u03bcL. Figure\n10b shows the confusion matrix,\nwhich summarized the performance of the sensor chip in identifying the\nCOVID-19 positive and negative samples, by benchmarking the results to\na gold-standard technique for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis known as the LabGun\nCOVID-19 RT-PCR diagnosis kit (FDA EUA approved).72\nThe sensor was thus able to correctly assign the positive and negative\nsamples to their respective groups with almost 100% accuracy,\nspecificity, and sensitivity (Figure 10b). It is worth mentioning that this\nthreshold value is not universal and may be subject to change with an\nincreasing number of tested clinical samples.\nOn the basis of the results obtained from the current study, we may\nconclude that ssDNA-capped AuNPs as a sensing element amplified the\nelectrical signal, while the use of ssDNA probes provided an enhanced\nselective output response only in the presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral\nRNA. To design the electrochemical biosensor, ssDNA-capped AuNPs (Au\nprobe) were drop-cast on a finely suspended graphene-coated filter\npaper. The electron transfer process was enhanced by utilizing gold\nnanoparticles, which provided a large surface area to conjugate ssDNA\nprobes and thus improved the electrochemical response of the device\nenormously for the target SARS-CoV-2, with no significant response to\nthe lack of target. To enhance the sensor sensitivity, the\nconcentrations of the four carefully designed ssDNA probes were\noptimized to achieve an improved electrical response. Under this\noptimal condition, the developed sensor chip demonstrated the ability\nto detect viral COVID-19 RNA in a wide linear range from 585.4\ncopies/\u03bcL to 5.854 \u00d7 107 copies/\u03bcL, with a\nsignificantly lower detection limit of 6.9 copies/\u03bcL. The\nssDNA-capped AuNPs provided an enhanced signal in response to its\ntarget, presumably due to the selective hybridization of the ssDNA\nprobes with their complementary sequences in four different segments\nof the same N-gene. Compared to the ssDNA-conjugated sensor chip or\npristine graphene chip, the ssDNA-capped AuNPs-graphene-based sensor\nchip showed an enhanced electrical response to the target with no\nobvious electric response toward the scrambled RNA. This enhanced\nsensitivity of the present sensor configuration can thus be explained\nby three possible reasons: suitably designed ssDNA probes, the signal\namplifying gold nanoparticles, and the conductive graphene\nnanoplatelet film. The high carrier mobility (>2000 cm2\nV s\u20131) of graphene provided enough sensitivity and\nadsorption capability of the charged analytes at its surface.74 Thus, the combination of graphene-ssDNA-AuNPs\nconstructs made the electrochemical biosensor platform an ideal\ncandidate for rapid and accurate diagnosis of positive COVID-19 cases.\nFurther, the design of the antisense probes to simultaneously target\ntwo regions of the SARS-CoV-2 N-gene ensured the reliability and\nfeasibility of the sensor even if one region of the viral gene\nundergoes mutation during its current cross-transmission. The\napplicability of the proposed sensor chip was also evaluated\nsuccessfully using SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA samples based on signal\namplification methodology mediated by the change in resistance.\nLinearity was achieved in a broad range of RNA concentrations from\n585.4 copies/\u03bcL to 5.854 \u00d7 107 copies/\u03bcL.\nIt was understood that viral RNA detection is more reliable than\nantibody detection due to the improved accuracy, specificity, and\nability of the current sensor to reduce false positive or negative\nresponses, as well as the fast diagnostic time frame after infection.\nThe performance of the sensor chip has been evaluated using clinical\nsamples from positive COVID-19 confirmed cases and healthy\nasymptomatic cases. Given that the tested clinical samples include RNA\nfrom various sources, including SARS-CoV-2, which are responsible for\ngenerating noise signals, the sensor limit of detection, which is 6.9\ncopies/\u03bcL, is low enough to use in clinical practice. Table S3 summarizes most of the peer-reviewed\nSARS-CoV-2 virus detection technologies. In comparison, our technology\nis devoid of any requirements for advanced instrumental facilities.\nMoreover, the detection time taken by the existing state-of-the-art\napproaches is either days or multiple hours. Our technology is on par\nwith the existing technologies with a test result time of \u223c5\nmin. Additionally, the major limitation of the antibody-based approach\n(lateral flow assays) is also addressed as the extent of infection is\ndetermined by detecting the presence of a virus and not just evidence\nof the virus being in the body. In short, the technology reported here\naddresses the shortcomings of the existing COVID-19 sensors in a POC\nsetting with a quicker sensing period without the need for any\nadvanced instrumental techniques, modern laboratory infrastructural\nfacilities, and the involvement of experienced researchers without\ncompromising the specificity and sensitivity.\nThe applications of electrochemical-based genosensors are far-reaching.\nThe sensor, when integrated with a benchtop device, could potentially\nbe used as a POC test in low-resource settings. The ability of the\ndeveloped graphene-based electrochemical sensor to detect the presence\nof viral RNA in a cost-effective and reusable method could be applied\nat home as well as in the doctor\u2019s office. The base unit will\ncomprise the electrical components (microcontrollers, LED screen,\nBluetooth, and Wi-Fi modules) as well as algorithms necessary to\nperform a POC test using the interfaced sensor. Furthermore, the base\ndevice can be supported by future software updates for the algorithms\nto perform multiplexed sensing to differentiate between different\nviral strains (e.g., influenza from\nSARS-CoV-2) to provide an effective diagnosis. The sensor could be\npriced at \u223c$10 per sensor.\nCurrently, the gold standard test for diagnosing COVID-19 is a PCR test\nwhere a healthcare worker collects samples and ships them to a lab for\na confirmatory test. A healthcare worker equipped with a sensor with\npreaffixed probes associated with SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA could eliminate\nthe need for a preliminary, and the sensor could be regarded as an\naccurate confirmatory test, reducing backlogs in the laboratories.\nAnother aspect of the developed sensor could be where a person at home\nwould purchase a kit that has the probes associated with SARS-CoV-2\nviral RNA and deposit a sample of treated saliva onto the sensor. If\nthe sensor detects an elevated presence of a known viral RNA that is\nassociated with COVID-19, then that person would be able to go to the\ndoctor and seek further screening tests and therapeutic interventions.\nThe sensor would be an effective tool in screening symptomatic as well\nas asymptomatic COVID cases. Furthermore, the same approach could be\nused at the doctor\u2019s office as a confirmatory test for the\npresence of other pathogenic bacterial and viral DNA/RNA. This would\nhelp the medical community to more effectively diagnose and fight off\nthe spread of current as well as future viral infections."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion ::: Results and Discussion", "text": "Briefly, we developed herein an electrochemical platform made up of\ngraphene and gold nanoparticles conjugated with suitably designed\nantisense oligonucleotides for the rapid, accurate, selective, and\nultrasensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA within a time period\nof less than 5 min. Four of the antisense ssDNA probes were used to\ncap AuNPs at an optimized concentration to target the viral N-gene\n(nucleocapsid phosphoprotein) selectively. Hyperspectral microscopic\nresults evidenced the sensitivity and the selectivity of the designed\nssDNA probes toward the target SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA. The sensitivity\nand analytical performance of the device were evaluated both in the\nabsence and in the presence of gold nanoparticles when conjugated with\neither citrate or antisense oligonucleotides. The results showed the\nimproved electrochemistry of the device only when deposited with the\nssDNA-capped AuNPs. Further, the selectivity of the device was\ndemonstrated with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viral RNA. This fully\nintegrated device successfully exhibited a broad linear detection\nrange from 585.4 copies/\u03bcL to 5.854 \u00d7 107\ncopies/\u03bcL, with a sensitivity of 231 (copies\n\u03bcL\u20131)\u22121. The sensor\nexhibits a limit of detection of 6.9 copies/\u03bcL without nucleic\nacid amplification, where the value achieved for the LOD is quite\ncomparable with the current clinical approaches. The advantages of the\ndeveloped biosensor over previously reported tests therefore include\nan improved limit of detection, no need for additional redox medium\nfor electron exchange, faster response to achieve stable data,\nexcellent shelf life, and its plausible economic production. The\ndesign of the ssDNA probes to simultaneously target two regions of\nSARS-CoV-2 N-gene ensures the feasibility and reliability of the\nsensor even if one region of the viral gene undergoes mutation during\nits current spread. In addition to this, the current methodology\novercomes the limitations of widely used antibody-based serological\ntests, as the developed test can detect the early stage of infection.\nMoreover, the developed platform can also be adapted to detect other\nviruses, which makes it a universal platform. Finally, clinical\nsamples collected from both COVID-19 positive patients and healthy\nasymptomatic subjects have been used to evaluate the sensor\nperformance. The sensor chip shows a significant change as a response\nto COVID-19 positive samples, whereas an insignificant change has been\nobserved as a response to the healthy subjects\u2019 samples, with a\nclassification accuracy of nearly 100%. Thus, the present device does\nnot require the ongoing traditional approach of amplifying cDNA from\nthe extracted RNA from the patients\u2019 bodily fluids and\nutilization of the cDNA for the detection of COVID-19. In contrast,\nthe current approach addresses the issue based on signal amplification\nmethodology mediated by the change in output voltage.
