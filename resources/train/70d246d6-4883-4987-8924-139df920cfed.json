[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The purpose of TIMSS which is an international project is to evaluate mathematics and science achievement of students on the basis of countries with programs, teaching methods and schools. It is known that we do not have satisfactory results from this examination. For this reason, teaching mathematics subject within the scope of the project, the opinions of teachers, students and prospective teachers on the difficulties and solution strategies of this process and solution strategies are important for having satisfactory results. In this sense, the purpose of this study is to find out the opinions of prospective primary mathematics teachers on the 8th grade mathematics subject within the scope of TIMSS. Besides, the aim is to determine the difficulties that prospective teachers think that they will encounter during the process of conducting lessons on these subjects and to determine solution strategies for these stated difficulties. The study which is designed according to these purposes is a qualitative study which is organized according to the phenemology design and in which document analysis technique is used. The study group is consisted of 99 third and fourth year prospective mathematics teachers in Kocaeli University, Education Faculty. Document analysis method was selected in this study. Opinion form which was validated in accordance with an expert's opinions and developed by the researcher, included 8 open-ended questions and was used for document analysis. Prospective teachers were given 25 minutes for filling opinions forms during data collection process. The obtained data were evaluated with content analysis. In conclusion, it was appeared that prospective teachers stated that they would not have difficulties in teaching the subject of 'Numbers' but they would have difficulties in teaching the subjects of 'Algebra', 'Geometry' and ' Data and Chance'. The difficulties were stated as in the following; difficulties coming from students, not knowing how to teach the subject and having abstract subjects. The solution strategies were stated as in the following; solving plenty of relevant examples, carrying out activities, using material and modelling/concretization."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study-TIMSS is a scanning research which is organized by International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement-IEA in every four years. This examination is conducted for evaluating the performance of 4 th and 8 th grade students (\u015ei\u015fman, Acat, Aypay & Karada\u011f, 2011) . The purpose of conducting this examination on these grades and in every four years is to observe trends of students' achievements according to years. Students who are in the fourth grades during an application period are becoming 8 th grade students in another application period. Therefore, it provides information about the transition between grades. For example; 4 th grade students in 2007 examination became 8 th grade students in 2011 examination (Y\u00fccel, Karada\u011f & Turan, 2013) . The sampling method also ensures the characteristics that the results can be generalized to a large extent (Berbero\u011flu, \u00c7elebi, \u00d6zdemir, Uysal & Yayan, 2003) . It is also aimed to provide feedback to school administrators, teachers, students and parents about the fields such as program, teachers' competencies and students' school satisfaction (Gonzalez & Miles, 2001) . Turkey participated in this examination which has been conducted for approximately fifty years in 1997 and 2007 at 8 th grade level (\u015ei\u015fman, Acat, Aypay & Karada\u011f, 2011) .\nIn the examination, the questions at the 8 th grades are classified in four mathematics domains. These domains are: 'Numbers', 'Algebra', 'Geometry' and 'Data and Chance'. The distribution of questions according to domains is as in the following; 30% from Numbers, 30% from Algebra, 20% from Geometry and 20% from Data and Chance (Mullis, Martin, Ruddock, O'Sullivan & Preuschoff, 2009 ). Our 8 th grade students became 27 th in numbers learning domain, 24 th in algebra domain, 21 st in geometry domain and 20 th in data and chance learning domain among 42 countries in TIMSS 2011 (Y\u00fccel, Karada\u011f & Turan, 2013) .\nThere are three cognitive levels in each of these domains. These levels are; knowing, applying and reasoning. The questions at the knowing level require knowing mathematical facts, methods and concepts; at the applying level they require knowing and conceptual understanding; at the reasoning level they require solving non-routine problems (Mullis & et al., 2009) . In this examination 35% of the questions is at knowing level, 40% of the questions is at applying level and 25% of them is at reasoning level (G\u00fcner, Sezer & Akku\u015f-\u0130spir, 2013) . Our 8 th grade students became 26 th in knowing skills, 20 th in transforming what they know to application and 21 st in reasoning skills among 42 countries in TIMSS 2011 (Y\u00fccel, Karada\u011f & Turan, 2013) .\nThere is an increase in mathematical achievement scores of Turkey in 1999 , 2007 and 2011 . However, in 2011 , when this increase is compared with the mean of all the other countries, it is understood that there is not an increase according to the previous term. Eight grade scores increased approximately 28 points from 2007 to 2011 (Y\u00fccel, Karada\u011f & Turan, 2013) . Most of the Turkish students are able to answer questions at the knowing level. In addition to that it was determined that they had difficulties in the applying and reasoning questions (G\u00fcner, Sezer & Akku\u015f-\u0130spir, 2013) . It is stated that very little students have high level skills such as generalizing, solving multi-stepped and complex problems and making inferences (Yayan, 2009 ).\nAs it is seen, the poor results of Turkish students are raising concerns and it is necessary to study on the factors that affected these poor results. Teachers are one of the most important factors that affect students' achievement. When related literature is reviewed, many studies can be seen in which the opinions of students on TIMSS, their TIMSS achievements, science and mathematics achievements of students and their attitudes towards science and mathematics, the opinions of teachers and prospective teachers, the features of course books that affect TIMMS are analyzed (Erba\u015f & Alacac\u0131, 2007; G\u00fcner, Sezer & Akku\u015f-\u0130spir, 2013; Haggarty & Pepin, 2002; House, 2006; K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck, \u015eeng\u00fcl & Katranc\u0131, 2014; Leung, 2002; Li, 2000; \u00d6zdemir, 2003; Papanastasiou & Zembylas, 2004; Shen, 2002; Webster & Fischer, 2000; Yayan & Berbero\u011flu, 2004; Yore, Anderson & Shymansky, 2002) . However, in literature review a study about the opinions of prospective teachers on teaching mathematics subject within the scope of TIMSS was not recognized. Vlaardingerbroek and Taylor (2003) found out in their studies that there was a str\u0131ng correlation between student achievement and teacher characteristics. Menon (2000) , searched for the reasons of students' failure. Two of the five factors that affected student achievement were identified as a centralized education program and a high quality mathematics and science teacher training. As G\u00fcner, Sezer and Akku\u015f-\u0130spir (2013) stated in their studies that all teachers should have been informed about TIMSS; they also stated that educational faculties had most of the responsibility on this issue. They expressed that in addition to train teachers who are qualified in educational methods and techniques, it is necessary for future teachers to have established information about the purposes of international mathematics education.\nThe opinions of prospective teachers on teaching 8 th grade mathematics subjects within the scope of TIMSS was tried to be identified with this study, a continuation of the study which was carried out by K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck, \u015eeng\u00fcl and Katranc\u0131 (2014) . After the opinions of prospective teachers have been identified, the awareness of them towards mathematical subjects within the scope of this examination will be revealed. Besides, it is predicted that this study will offer an insight into the related literature. Karamustafao\u011flu and Sontay (2012) pointed out the facts that teachers participating in TIMSS project did not have any information about an international examination such as TIMSS and the awareness levels of teachers and students towards TIMMS were in low level. From this perspective, it is seen as important to determine the opinions of prospective teachers. In this sense, the purpose of this study is to take the opinions of prospective teachers who are studying in teaching primary mathematics department on 8 th grade mathematics subject within the scope of TIMSS. In order to achieve this goal, the answers of the following problems were searched.\n1. When you start your career, do you think that you might encounter difficulties when teaching 'Numbers' subject? If so, please indicate these difficulties. 2. What do you suggest to overcome these difficulties that you indicated when teaching numbers? 3. When you start your career, do you think that you might encounter difficulties when teaching 'Algebra' subject? If so, please indicate these difficulties. 4.

At the end of this time, the opinion forms which were filled by the prospective teachers were collected by the researchers."}, {"section_title": "Data Analysis", "text": "The data of the study was evaluated by using content analysis. The purpose of content analysis is to get correlations and concepts which can explain the collected data. The reality that can be hidden in these data is tried to be uncovered with this analysis. The basic operation is organizing and interpreting the data in a way that readers can understand by combining similar data around certain concepts and themes (Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m & \u015eim\u015fek, 2008) .\nThe first step of content analysis is coding the data (Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m & \u015eim\u015fek, 2008) . Strauss and Corbin (1990) mentioned about three kinds of coding. These are; coding according certain concepts specified before, coding according to concepts inferred from the data and coding in a general framework. In this coding according to concepts inferred from the data was carried out. In this kind of coding, the data is read by the researcher line by line and important dimensions in accordance with the purpose of the study are determined. The researcher produce certain codes according to the meaning appeared. In this way, the code list is made and this list generates a conceptual structure for processing all of the data (Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m & \u015eim\u015fek, 2008) . The data collected in this study was read by the researchers line by line and a list was created by obtaining certain codes.\nIt is not enough to code the data and classify the data according to these codes. It is necessary to find themes which gather the codes under certain categories and which can explain the codes in a general level. The codes should be combined and common features should be found. The process is, in a sense, a thematic coding and categorizing collected data through codes (Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m & \u015eim\u015fek, 2008) . In this study, the list which was created by obtaining certain codes was deeply analyzed; separate themes were created by the researchers by finding the common aspects of the codes. The agreement between themes was calculated with the formula which was developed by Miles and Huberman (1994) Later on, it is necessary to define, explain and present the data in a language that readers can understand. It is necessary for the researcher to be descriptive as possible and to present the findings to readers. At this stage, the researcher does not express his/her opinions and interpretations but only presents the collected data in a processed way (Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m & \u015eim\u015fek, 2008) . Also in this study, themes were explained in details by analyzing the codes and themes obtained in this study deeply by the researchers and necessary descriptions and definitions were made. Besides, the persuasiveness of the study was tried to be ensured by creating examples from the collected data. The frequency (f) and percentage (%) were used in the correlations and categorizations of the data and interpretations were definitely not made at this stage but the collected data were presented to the readers in a processed way."}, {"section_title": "Findings", "text": "The findings obtained in this study were presented to the reader according to the order of the research problems. In this sense; the answers of the prospective teachers for the question stated as \"When you start your career, do you think that you might encounter difficulties when teaching 'Numbers' subject?\" were displayed in Table 1 When Table 1 was analyzed, it was found that 26 (44,07%) third year prospective teachers thought that they might encounter a difficulty but 33 (55,93%) of them thought that they might not encounter any kind of difficulty. 16 (40%) fourth year prospective teachers thought that they might encounter a difficulty but 24 (60%) of them thought that they might not encounter any kind of difficulty. When it was analyzed according to their genders, 35 (48,61%) female students thought that they would encounter a difficulty and 37 (51,39%) of them thought that they might not encounter any kind of difficulty but 7 (25,93%) male students thought that they might encounter a difficulty and 20 (74,07%) of them thought that they might not encounter any kind of difficulty.\nIn general, 42 (42,42%) prospective teachers stated that they might encounter a difficulty when teaching 'Numbers' subject, 57 (57,58%) of them think that they might not encounter any kind of difficulty when teaching 'Numbers' subject. The themes about the data of the prospective teachers who stated they might encounter a difficulty regarding the first research problem were given in Table 2 . When Table 2 was analyzed, it was seen that 12 third year prospective teachers stated that they might have difficulties according to 'student' theme and 10 fourth year prospective teachers stated that they might have difficulties according to this theme. When gender was considered, it was seen that 20 females and 2 male prospective teachers stated they might have difficulties according to this theme.

Besides, it was appeared that some prospective teachers made more than one suggestion. The findings regarding the second research problem were given in Table 3 . When Table 3 was analyzed, it was seen that the suggestions for overcoming the difficulties grouped under four different themes. 15 third year prospective teachers stated that it was necessary to solve plenty of examples about the subject for overcoming the difficulties in teaching Numbers subject. When forth year prospective teachers were analyzed, it was found out that making modelling/concretization was the most frequently repeated solution strategy. In gender based analysis, it was determined that female prospective teachers stated that it was necessary to solve plenty of examples about the subject but male prospective teachers focused on conducting activities/using materials. When Table 3 is analyzed in general, it is seen that 21 (38,18%) prospective teachers stated the necessity of solving plenty of examples, 14 (25,45%) prospective teachers focused on conducting activities/using materials related with the subject.

Besides, it was appeared that some prospective teachers made more than one suggestion. The findings regarding the fourth research problem were given in Table 6 . When Table 6 was analyzed, it was appeared that 5 different solution strategies were offered to overcome the difficulties when teaching Algebra subject. It was seen that both third year and fourth year prospective teachers stated that they could overcome the difficulties by using modelling most frequently. In the analysis carried out by considering gender, it was seen that female prospective teachers mostly selected modelling as a solution strategy and male prospective teachers mostly selected teaching style and solving plenty of examples as a solution strategy. In general, it was found out that they stated the necessity of selecting modelling solution strategy mostly. For instance; The answers of the prospective teachers whether or not they would have difficulties about the subject regarding the fifth research problem which was asked as \"When you start your career, do you think that you might encounter difficulties when teaching 'Geometry' subject?

When Table 8 was analyzed, it was seen that both third and fourth year prospective teachers stated that they would encounter difficulties about 'student' theme most. In the analysis carried out by considering gender, it was appeared that they stated that they would encounter difficulties in 'student' theme most. In general, it was ascertained that it was stated that with 25 (54,38%) repetition the difficulty regarding 'student' theme would appear most. It was appeared that they expressed that since geometry requires seeing, students would have difficulties and they would have difficulties in teaching the subject because of students' perception.

In total it was determined that 53 (53,53%) prospective teachers stated that they might encounter a difficulty, 46 (46,47%) of them stated that they might not encounter any kind of difficulty. The findings of the analysis which was carried out in order to understand their thoughts about what kind of difficulties they might encounter were displayed in Table 11 . When Table 11 was analyzed, it was seen that both third and fourth year prospective teachers stated that they would encounter difficulties about 'student' theme most. It was appeared that they stated that they would have difficulties as they thought the subject could not be perceived by students, students could not understand the subject and the subjects would be difficult for the students. In the analysis carried out by considering gender, it was appeared that none of the male prospective teachers thought that they would have difficulties when teaching 'Data and Chance' subject.

In this sense, the opinions of prospective teachers were taken according to four mathematics domains related with 8 th grades within the scope of TIMSS.\nWhile 42 (42,42%) prospective teachers stated that they might encounter difficulties in teaching numbers subject, 57 (57,58%) of the stated that they might not encounter any kind of difficulty. It was concluded that prospective teachers stated that they might not encounter any kind of difficulty in teaching numbers subject. It was appeared about this topic that there might be difficulties in terms of the facts that students cannot perceive the subject; students cannot understand the subject as they have negative attitudes about the subject because they think the subject is difficult, the subject is difficult for the students, not knowing how to teach the subject and concretizing the subject. It was determined that these difficulties could be overcame by solving plenty of examples about the subject, carrying out activities and using modelling.\nWhile 64 (64,65%) prospective teachers stated that they might encounter difficulties in teaching algebra subject, 35 (35,35%) of them stated that they did not think that they might encounter any kind of difficulty. It was concluded that prospective teachers stated that they might encounter difficulties in teaching algebra subject. It was found on this subject that there could be difficulties in cases when students cannot understand the subject as it is complicated, students got confused because of using unknown expression in addition to numbers and not knowing how to teach the subject to students. It was determined that these difficulties could be overcame by solving plenty of examples about the subject, carrying out activities and using modelling and concretizing.\nWhile 44 (44,44%) prospective teachers did not think that they might encounter difficulties in teaching geometry subject, 55 (55,56%) of them thought that they might encounter any kind of difficulty. In this sense, it was concluded that prospective teachers stated that they might encounter difficulties in teaching geometry subject. It was appeared that there might be difficulties in terms of the facts that students cannot solve problems since geometry requires seeing, prospective teachers express that they cannot draw geometrical figures properly, the subject is abstract and it is hard to concretize the subject. The solution strategies for overcoming the stated difficulties were determined as in the following; using material, carrying out activities, solving plenty of examples and concretizing the subject.\nWhile 53 (53,53%) prospective teachers stated that they might encounter difficulties in teaching data and chance subject, 46 (46,47%) of them did not think that they might encounter any kind of difficulty. It was concluded that prospective teachers stated that they might encounter difficulties when teaching data and chance subject. It was determined that they stated that they might encounter difficulties in points that students cannot understand the subject since the subject is perceived as difficult by students, the perception and attitudes of students, abstract subject and not knowing how to teach the subject. It was concluded that the stated difficulties could be overcame by solving plenty of examples, using materials, carrying out activities and modelling.\nWhen findings were evaluated in general, it was appeared that prospective teachers stated that they might have difficulties in all other learning domains other than numbers subject. The stated difficulties were stated as; difficulties coming from students, not knowing how to teach the subject and abstract subjects. The solution strategies were determined as; solving plenty of examples related with the subject, carrying out activities, using materials and making modelling/concretizing. Karamustafao\u011flu and Sontay (2012) suggested that it was necessary to spend more time with the activities that enabled students to understand the subjects and concepts easily in science and mathematics lessons. In this sense, it was determined that a similar suggestion was offered with the suggestions of prospective teachers. Berbero\u011flu and others (2003) found in their studies that the most important factors that affected achievements of students were the success-failure perceptions of students and their socio-economic levels. Similarly, Yayan and Berbero\u011flu (2004) stated that one of the most important factors that affected the achievements of students was the failure perceptions of the students. Also in that study prospective teachers stated that they had difficulties coming from students when teaching subjects. From this perspective, it can be said that prospective teachers have realistic concerns. Yayan and Berbero\u011flu (2004) specified that the reason of students' failure in mathematics was studentcentred activities. It was determined in the study that prospective teachers stated that it was necessary to use activities frequently in teaching subjects. In this case, it can be said that prospective teachers have focused on a subject that which should be solved. It was determined that in countries such as Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong and Korea which had higher rankings in TIMSS examination the time allocated for sports as an extracurricular activity was less than other countries participating the same examination (Leung, 2002) . In this sense, it is appeared that the activities which are offered as a solution strategy should be prepared meticulously. G\u00fcner, Sezer and Akku\u015f-\u0130spir (2013) suggested in their studies to give the necessary support to novice teachers. They stated that in order to inform all teachers, it was necessary to provide teacher training courses. Karamustafao\u011flu and Sontay (2012) found out in their studies that practitioner teachers accepted the seminar as beneficial but a late one. Prospective teachers stated also in their study that they might encounter difficulties when teaching mathematical subjects within the scope of TIMSS. In this regard, it is thought that the awareness of the prospective teachers should be raised. Prospective teachers should be informed about both the content of the examination and how the examination is implemented. In this way, it is thought that they will have pre-information about this examination that they can experience when they start their carriers as teachers. Sar\u0131er (2010) offered some solutions in his study that the results of international examinations should be evaluated entirely, the solutions for increasing the achievements of the students should be developed with the cooperation of Ministry of Education and the Council of Higher Education and educational policies that can produce active solutions to problems should be developed by considering these policies once again. When the findings of this study were evaluated, the suggestions of prospective teachers were attracted attentions. In this sense, it is suggested to carry out teaching lessons in more detailed way in educational faculties. The necessity for focusing on the teaching of mathematics subjects is appeared. In this study the opinions of the prospective teachers about the eighth grade mathematics subjects were analyzed. The reason of this, prospective teachers in the study group will teach at middle school level. From this perspective, another study for teaching subjects within the scope of fourth grades with prospective classroom teachers can be designed. Besides, the opinions of prospective classroom teachers can also be analyzed."}]
