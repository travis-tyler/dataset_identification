While studies have shown that A\u03b242 is markedly elevated in AD and have clarified many of the molecular steps involved 23 , it is still not fully known why or how this accumulation occurs. This is important since the degree of A\u03b242 plaque in clinically diagnosed AD and MCI subjects is variable with some 30% of clinically diagnosed AD patients and half of MCI subjects failing to show significant A\u03b242 plaques at autopsy and likewise about a third of cognitively normal elderly subjects show some degree of A\u03b242 pathology at autopsy 29 . These findings suggest a need for better pathology-based and supported diagnoses, rather than clinical diagnostic groupings (such as probable AD or MCI) as a major determinant of A\u03b242 pathology.\nThe introduction of PET ligands with high affinity and specificity to A\u03b242 has made it easier to perform clinic-pathologic correlative studies 2, 6, 20 . An example of such a tracer is 18F-florbetapir 6 . A recent multicenter clinical-histopathologic validation study has shown a high correlation between florbetapir PET measurements in living subjects and autopsy measured A\u03b242 pathology 6 . Florbetapir PET was recently approved by the FDA for clinical use as a diagnostic adjunct to assess the presence or absence of A\u03b242 plaque. PET studies examining determinants of A\u03b242 plaque build-up in late-life have linked it to a number of factors, though increasing age, memory impairments (e.g. MCI or AD) and apolipoprotein \u03b54 carrier status are the most consistently replicated findings 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 24, 25, 27, 28, 30, 31 .\nIn this study, we analyzed florbetapir PET data from a national biomarker study (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, ADNI) 18, 31 to examine the relative contribution of various factors and the effect of their interactions on the accumulation of regional cortical amyloid in 602 subjects across four stages of progressive cognitive impairment -normal controls (C, n=194), early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI, n=212), late MCI (LMCI, N=132), mild AD (N=64)."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study Design", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.ucla.edu) 31 . The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early Alzheimer's disease (AD). Determination of sensitive and specific markers of very early AD progression is intended to aid researchers and clinicians to develop new treatments and monitor their effectiveness, as well as lessen the time and cost of clinical trials. ADNI is the result of efforts of many co-investigators from a broad range of academic institutions and private corporations, and subjects have been recruited from over 50 sites across the U.S. and Canada.\nAll subjects, and guardians as appropriate, gave written informed consent and the study was approved by institutional ethics committees at each site. They include newly recruited and former participants of the three phases of ADNI including ADNI-1, ADNI-GO, and ADNI-2. ADNI-1 enrolled participants considered either normal, MCI, or AD. ADNI-GO then began and comprised of 200 subjects that could be diagnosed as early MCI (EMCI) to reflect even more discrete memory changes, when the patients display less rigorous logical memory cut-offs, but continue to meet other MCI criteria. Then, ADNI 2 enrolled around 550 subjects spanning the diagnoses of normal, EMCI, MCI, and AD. Florbetapir and cognitive measurements were obtained for all newly enrolled and continuing participants in ADNI-GO and ADNI2 and the cognitive measures taken closest to PET scan are used for this study.

Complete details regarding inclusion/ exclusion criteria can be found at www.adni-info.org. In summary, the subjects range in age from 55-94 years, had completed a minimum of 6 years of education, were fluent in Spanish or English, and did not have any other significant neurological disease. After complete description of the study to the subjects, written informed consent was obtained. MCI participants gave a subjective memory complaint with a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) of 0.5 and displayed a logical memory deficit were in the category of single-or multi-domain amnestic. The education-adjusted scores for the delayed paragraph recall subscore on the WMS-R Logical Memory II differentiated the EMCI group such that EMCI scores were between normals and MCI, but continued to display a CDR of 0.5.

Details of PET scanners used in the study, imaging protocol and quality control measures have been published 18 . Images were spatially aligned, averaged, interpolated to a standard voxel size, and smoothed to a resolution of 8-mm full width at half maximum. In order to quantify florbetapir values, we used one or two structural 1.5 T or 3T MRI scans which were acquired within 12 months of the florbetapir PET scan to define cortical regions of interest (ROIs) and also the cerebellum reference region. For any subjects with unavailable MRI scans within a year of the florbetapir, the most recent scan was used. We used Freesurfer v. 4.5.0 (surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/) to segment and parcellate images into individual cortical regions of interest (frontal, anterior/posterior cingulate, lateral parietal, lateral temporal) so that the mean florbetapir uptake from grey matter relative to uptake in the whole cerebellum (white and grey matter) could be extracted. The ratio of ROI-to-whole cerebellum generates standard uptake value ratios (SUVRs) for each subject in the four florbetapir cortical regions. An average across the four regions (frontal, parietal, temporal, cingulate) compared to whole cerebellum accounts for the composite/global ratios for each subject. The specific regions comprising the ROIs can be found in Appendix I.

The log transformation was chosen because it makes the distribution of the errors approximately Gaussian in shape. Coefficients are given in Table II below. Our initial model (Equation 1) did not include gender but we also ran the same model subsequently with the addition of a term for gender and report those results.\nCohen's D indicates effect size. Significance was determined by two-sided Wald tests. All statistical analysis was set two-tailed, p<0.05 a priori for terms in the multivariate. Pairwise comparisons between combinations of diagnostic class and ApoE allele were conducted using the two sample t-test. P-values were adjusted using Holm's method for multiple comparisons (Holm, S. A simple sequentially rejective multiple test procedure. Scandinavian Journal of Statistics, 6, 65-70, 1979 ) and are shown in Table III . Table I depicts the baseline demographics of the 602 subjects in this study. The diagnostic groups were reasonably close in terms of age and educational level and ApoE4 prevalence was highest in AD and lowest in NC. As expected there was a cognitive progression from NC to EMCI to LMCI to AD and likewise mean global amyloid SUVR values were highest in AD followed by LMCI, EMCI and NC (Table I, Figure I ). Regional cortical SUVRs were highest in cingulate followed by frontal and parietal, and lowest in the temporal lobe (Table  I) ."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "In a linear mixed effects model with all variables, the effect of each clinical diagnosis stage (compared to controls) on amyloid SUVR levels was significant (p<0.0001 for all) (Table II, Figure I shows illustrative PET images). Each diagnostic stage also differs from the other in amyloid burden (p<0.036 to p<0.001) with the exception of the comparison of EMCI with LMCI (p<0.82). The difference between AD and control (estimate 0.14, p<0.0001) is roughly twice that of difference between LMCI and control (estimate 0.07, p<0.0001) and thrice that of difference between EMCI and control (estimate 005, p<0.0001) ( Table I ).\nThe effect of Apo E \u03b54+ on amyloid SUVR was highly significant (p<0.0001). As shown in Figure II , the stage-specific amyloid load is markedly different by genotype. E4+ AD subjects have higher SUVRs than all other groups (p<0.0005). However, ApoE \u03b54+ normal controls had highly significantly greater mean plaque density across all cortical regions than \u03b54\u2212 EMCI and \u03b54\u2212 LMCI (p<0.0001, p=0.0009) and showed higher, though nonsignificant, mean value than \u03b54\u2212AD patients (p<0.27). Likewise, ApoE \u03b54+ EMCI and LMCI subjects had significantly greater mean plaque density across all cortical regions than \u03b54\u2212 AD patients (p<0.027, p<0.0001) (see Table III , all values adjusted for multiple comparisons). Lastly, the mean SUVR difference between ApoE \u03b54+ and \u03b54\u2212 AD subjects was greater than the difference between ApoE \u03b54+ AD and \u03b54+ control subjects. Relative effect sizes (Cohen's D) for each of the variables showed that the effect size for ApoE4 (0.96) was almost twice as large as that of an AD diagnosis (0.51), thrice that of an LMCI diagnosis (0.34) and four times as much as an EMCI diagnosis (0.25).\nThe effect of age on SUVR was not significant (p<0.63) in this model but there were weak interactive effects for age in some diagnostic groups, notably AD (p<0.05). We also examined regional cortical SUVR differences by cognitive stage. Each of the cortical regional amyloid SUVRs differed from the other (p<0.001) with highest values in cingulate followed by parietal and frontal and lowest in the temporal lobes ( Figure II , Table II) . This difference was seen in all four cognitive/diagnosis stages. The interaction between regional SUVR and \u03b54+ status was significant for frontal lobe with increased SUVRs. In the second model, which included all of the above terms plus gender, the effects of ApoE4 and diagnosis remained highly significant. The effect of gender was marginally significant (p=0.03) with women showing higher SUVRs than men."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "To our knowledge, this is the largest study to examine the effects of age and genotype on the growth (cross-sectionally) of regional cortical neuritic beta-amyloid deposition across the different cognitive stages leading to clinical AD. Although many studies have noted amyloid PET uptake differences between various diagnostic groups or between ApoE genotypes 1,2,5,6,7,8,9,10,13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 24, 25, 27, 28, 30, 31 , the key finding that distinguishes our study is the demonstration of the large magnitude of the effect of the ApoE4 allele relative to the effect of age or a clinical MCI or AD diagnosis, which has not been fully appreciated before. We found that ApoE \u03b54+ normal controls had significantly greater mean cortical plaque density than \u03b54\u2212 EMCI and LMCI and similar levels to \u03b54\u2212 AD patients. We also found that the mean difference between ApoE \u03b54+ and \u03b54\u2212 AD subjects was greater than the difference between ApoE \u03b54+ AD and \u03b54+ control subjects. Both these findings are striking and not previously reported. The effect size for ApoE4's association with betaamyloid (Cohen's D 0.96) was much larger than and nonoverlapping with that of age.\nAge has previously been considered a very strong predictor of amyloid deposition in prior pathology and imaging studies 9, 15, 17, 27, 29 , but our multivariate model suggests that age effects are small after covarying for ApoE4 and cognitive status. Fleisher et al. recently showed substantial age effects 9 . However, Fleisher et al. had two control groups -older controls (> 50 years) and younger (< 50 yrs) controls. For their age analyses, they combined both older normal (68+/\u221211 yrs) and younger normal (mean age 27 +/\u2212 8 yrs) into a single group with an age range was 18-92 years. In our study, we used just the ADNI older control group, which has a much more restricted age range, since ADNI has no younger controls. Thus, our study may have been unable to show an age effect due to a population sample that is too old. In addition, the Fleisher study showed that age and APOE have spatially independent effects, as well as having age \u00d7 APOE4 interactions, with age showing a more frontal predominant pattern than APOE4. The current study shows an interaction between APOE4 and SUVR in the frontal lobe, but did not test for the same interactions. Thus, differences in sampling and statistical methods may explain the different findings which will need to be resolved by future studies.\nOur study also documents that there are regional differences in fibrillar amyloid plaque density with the highest levels in cingulate and lowest in temporal cortex, and that these differences are relatively stable across each of the diagnostic stages and genotypes, except for an interaction with frontal lobe where the ApoE4 effect was significant. To our knowledge, this is the first multicenter study to document such differences across the cognitive spectrum. The burden is 1% higher in the frontal lobe when the ApoE \u03b54+ is present. The magnitude of interaction effects between region and ApoE are small (relative to the main effects of diagnosis, region and ApoE \u03b54+), suggesting each region discriminates between the genotypes with relatively equal ability. Thus, fibrillar beta-amyloid, as detected by PET, increases relatively uniformly across each of the four cortical regions from the preclinical to prodromal to mild AD stages, suggesting that the spatial triggers for A\u03b242 aggregation are already present in all four cortical regions long before the onset of clinical AD. Further, the presence of a relatively high amyloid density in the cingulate, supports functional MRI, SPECT and FDG-PET data pointing to regions within the cingulate as a site of early metabolic and connectivity dysfunction in AD 14 as well as findings of high amyloid density in the cingulate in presenelin 1 mutation carriers 11 . We did not examine subregions with each main region in this report to avoid too many comparisons and risk of a Type 1 error, but this may be important to study further.\nOverall, these results suggest that ApoE4 genetic information is a better predictor of amyloid pathology than age, gender or clinical diagnosis. It's possible that the lower SUVRs seen in E4\u2212 AD patients may reflect an inaccurate diagnosis, lower levels of intrinsic pathology or both. Likewise the lower levels of pathology in E4\u2212 MCI subjects reflects the heterogeneous nature of MCI. Thus, our findings offer strong support for the need for a pathology based and supported diagnosis.\nThe use of a large carefully diagnosed and studied national sample of subjects, 18, 31 in addition to a well validated PET tracer florbetapir, 6 are strengths of the study. The limitations of our study are the cross-sectional nature, use of largely academic research sites for this study, and potential for bias from variables not measured (such as other genes, vascular risk factors, soluble amyloid). Our use of the term \"growth\" is intended to reflect cross-sectional increases in SUVR across progressive diagnostic stages and we do not mean to say the slopes were different between ApoE groups. Clearly growth within a given subject or slope differences over time between groups can only be measured through longitudinal studies. Likewise we use the term \"effect\" as a statistical term rather than to imply cause and effect since our findings are associations. We also interpret our SUVR findings to imply changes in amyloid density but acknowledge that PET imaging is only a surrogate marker of pathology. Despite such limitations, our data are consistent with strong evidence that ApoE4 protein decreases cellular clearance of A\u03b242 and enhances the stability of extracellular A\u03b242 aggregates in brain 4 . These data are also consistent with prior imaging data from ApoE4+ normals 8, 9, 17, 22, 24 and familial AD mutation carriers 3 , and suggest a significant temporal offset between deposition of amyloid, functional disruption, and emergence of clinical symptoms 12, 21, 26 . Our data also suggests the variance in amyloid deposition in elderly subjects is not fully accounted for by ApoE4, suggesting a role for both non-genetic factors and yet to be identified genes consistent with a recent genetic study 28 .\nLastly, our data also show that genetic factors reflect a great deal of valuable information when evaluating a patient's condition and direct measurement of pathology in-vivo, such as with florbetapir PET, may help us better study genetic-pathologic correlates. Such findings might be useful for clinicians to know as they implement amyloid imaging in routine practice. Our findings highlight the need for genotype-specific biomarker based pathologic classification of AD stages and suggest further that the ApoE4\u2212associated amyloid plaque growth should be a major target for preventive therapy.\nPMD, TZW, SML and JRP have received research grants and/or advisory fees from several government agencies, advocacy groups and pharmaceutical/imaging companies.
