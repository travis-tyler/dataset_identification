[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Tidal wetlands maintain high biotic diversity and primary productivity (Beck et al. 2001); influence many biogeochemical cycles as a critical junction between terrestrial and marine environments (Turner and Millward 2002); and are considered some of the most economically valuable ecosystems on the planet (Barbier et al. 2011). Despite their clear importance, a substantial number of U.S. estuaries -especially those along the Pacific Coast -are poorly studied. Oregon tidal wetlands like most other Pacific Northwest (PNW) wetlands are particularly underrepresented within literature concerning global wetland change (e.g., Chmura et al. 2003;Ouyang and Lee 2014;Crosby et al. 2016;Morris et al. 2016;Kirwan et al. 2016). The paucity of data on Oregon wetlands is likely attributable to their small size; excepting the Columbia River estuary, the median area of the major estuaries in Oregon is 11.3 km 2 . However, Oregon estuaries provide economically and societally important ecosystem services. For instance, coastal upwelling during the summer combined with runoff from red-alder-dominated watersheds naturally enhances nutrients within Oregon estuaries leading to high productivity (Brown and Ozretich 2009). This enhanced productivity supports higher trophic levels and additionally may result in greater carbon burial within estuarine sediments. Though carbon burial in PNW tidal wetlands may be relatively high on a per-area basis (Crooks et al. 2014), small spatial extents limit the importance of Oregon tidal wetlands in global carbon budgets. Nevertheless, accurate assessment of carbon burial will help policy makers better establish the monetary value in carbon markets of tidal wetland protection and restoration. Salmon, which utilize estuarine productivity and tidal wetland habitat, remain a huge economic and cultural staple for the PNW, as well (Wissmar and Simenstad 1998). Runoff of eroded sediment from logging; pesticides, herbicides, fertilizers, and animal waste from agriculture; and industrial pollutants and municipal solid waste from urban areas is trapped within and biogeochemically filtered by estuarine sediments (Thom and Borde 1998). Astoundingly, an estimated 50% of tidal wetlands has been lost or damaged globally (Barbier et al. 2011), and another 20% to 45% (by area) is projected to be drowned by 2100 under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) mean and maximum estimates of eustatic sea level (ESL) rise (Craft et al. 2009). Further, the most notable cases of tidal wetland drowning are linked to limited sediment inputs (e.g., Mississippi River Delta, Chesapeake Bay, and Venice Lagoon; Weston 2014). However, national wetland aerial extents were considered stable by a 2004 -2009 study (Dahl and Stedman 2013) and non-linear ecogeomorphic feedbacks may dampen the effects of accelerated ESL rise (French 2006). Briefly, sea level rise creates accommodation space for allochthonous sediment to accumulate while wetland vegetation thickens shoots adding organic matter (OM) at the surface and subsurface; this gained elevation is maintained through reduced current and wave speeds (Kirwan and Megonigal 2013). Bias within the literature towards reporting predominantly on threatened tidal wetlands has therefore led to an over-exaggeration of wetland vulnerability to future relative sea level (RSL) acceleration (Kirwan et al. 2016). Oregon wetlands provide contrasting examples, as they may be comparatively resilient. For instance, the Oregon coastline experiences both slow RSL rise and large quantities of sediment input, suggesting enhanced stability under these stressors. PNW estuaries are also relatively undisturbed in comparison to U.S. East and Gulf coast wetlands, experiencing only moderate exploitation since the 1800s, including diking for agriculture, dam construction, and increased erosion from logging (Thom and Borde 1998). In fact, most Oregon tidal wetland restoration projects simply require removal of dikes without extensive fill removal (Frenkel and 3 Morlan 1991) or relocation of residents as would be necessary in more populated estuaries (e.g., San Francisco Bay; Gedan et al. 2009). Despite these advantages, PNW estuaries may still be vulnerable to drowning as they are narrow and thus incapable of landward migration beyond the Coast Range foothills (Thom 1992). Many authors have identified areas susceptible to \"coastal squeeze\" as the most defenseless against drowning (Torio and Chmura 2013;Kirwan et al. 2016). Assessment of the current tidal wetland health, including vertical accretion rates under recent ESL rise and relative contributions of lithogenic sediment and organic carbon to accretion, within Oregon estuaries is thus imperative if we are to develop a baseline for ecosystem function, make global comparisons with PNW wetlands, and assess future resilience. Furthermore, ignoring Oregon wetlands may deprive us of an ideal field laboratory to test model predictions of wetland evolution, deemed integral by Mudd (2011). RSL change has traditionally been thought to control the formation and evolution of tidal wetlands (Friedrichs and Perry 2001). As RSL rises creating accommodation space, the wetland platform aggrades vertically through feedbacks between the vegetation, sediment, and estuarine flow field, thereby maintaining position relative to sea level. However, recent studies have indicated that changes in sediment delivery rates may have largely determined the behavior of estuaries along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of North America (e.g., Colman and Bratton 2003;Day et al. 2000;Kirwan et al. 2011). For example, in the Plum Island estuary, accelerated downstream sediment delivery due to erosion associated with land-use change following European settlement expanded tidal wetlands, while ecogeomorphic feedbacks maintained estuarine morphology after sediment supply was reduced in the 20 th century (Kirwan et al. 2011). Wetland vegetation largely contributes to these feedbacks through addition of OM at the surface, decay and 4 subsequent expansion of subsurface OM, and reduction of current and wave speeds thus increasing sediment deposition and retention (Kirwan and Megonigal 2013). Consequently, the dominant factor -RSL rise or sediment delivery rate -controlling their formation and growth remains debated. This uncertainty is due mainly to confounding variables making comparisons within and amongst tidal wetlands difficult. PNW estuaries present a unique opportunity to constrain the relative impacts of sea level change and sediment delivery rates over the past ~ 150 yrs because both factors vary along the coast, but in understood ways. Vertical land motions at the Oregon coast result from the largescale subduction of the Juan de Fuca plate underneath the North American plate, and trenchparallel differences in strain accumulation cause latitudinally varying uplift rates (Mitchell et al. 1994). ESL rise in the Northeast Pacific Ocean coupled with this variable uplift results in a range of RSL changes between -1.0 mm y -1 in southern and northern Oregon (i.e., falling RSL), and +1.5 mm yr -1 in central Oregon (Komar et al. 2011). Independently, there exists a more than thirty-fold range in fluvial sediment flux to Oregon estuaries (Wheatcroft and Sommerfield 2005). Secondary variables, including tidal range, water temperature and salinity, particulate organic carbon (C org ) type, and wetland plant assemblages, remain relatively uniform within these estuaries, acting as controlled variables (Hickey and Banas 2003). Thus, we hypothesize that if vertical accretion rates reflect RSL change within three Oregon estuaries -Youngs Bay, Tillamook Bay, and the Salmon River estuary -despite vastly different sediment supplies, then RSL primarily controls wetland growth. However, we might conclude that the magnitude of sediment supply controls vertical accretion if these rates vary with sediment flux rather than RSL. In summary, the goals of this study are four-fold: 1. Assess the relative importance of contemporary RSL change and the magnitude of sediment supply on tidal wetland vertical accretion within three estuaries that maintain differences among these primary variables but have similar secondary variables "}, {"section_title": "Study sites", "text": "All three estuaries -Youngs Bay, Tillamook Bay, and the Salmon River Estuary -are located on the northern coast of Oregon ( Figure 1A). The Youngs and Lewis and Clark Rivers drain the 478 km 2 Youngs Bay watershed ( Figure 1B). The Youngs River, along which core sites were located, drains the largest portion of the watershed, 319 km 2 . The estuary exchanges water with the much larger Columbia River Estuary through its 3.7-km-wide inlet. The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) report semidiurnal tides that average about 2.1 m with extremes of 3.2 m (station 9439026). Though the estuary supported extensive freshwater and brackish tidal wetlands including Sitka spruce swamp, much of these habitats have been diked for grazing and rural development and many of the small streams have been channelized (Lev et al. 2006). The upper portion of the watershed has been heavily harvested for timber, as well. The Cooperage Slough site (CS02 and CS03; Figure 1B) Figure 1B). The Wallooskee Youngs (WY04; Figure 1B) site, which is low marsh and located outside a dike, primarily supports Lyngbye's sedge (Carex lyngbyei), soft-stem bulrush (Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani), and common spikerush (Eleocharis palustris; Brophy et al. 2017). Tillamook Bay, which is 56 km 2 , is the largest estuary and watershed in this study. Five rivers, the Miami, Kilchis, Wilson, Trask, and Tillamook, drain the 1,361-km 2 basin ( Figure 1C; Komar et al. 2004). The area of Tillamook Bay tidal wetlands is estimated at 22.3 km 2 (Ewald and Brophy 2012). The mean tide range is 2.6 m and extreme tides can reach 3.7 m (station 9437540; NOAA). Diking that facilitates dairy farming dominates land alteration near the Bay, while much of the Coast Range has been logged for timber. Additionally, a series of wildfires known as the Tillamook burns occurred between 1931 and 1954 spanning 707 km 2 of forest within the Tillamook Bay watershed (Komar et al. 2004). The primary vegetation found at the Bay Marsh site (BM01 and BM02; Figure 1C) is creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera), Lyngbye's sedge The Salmon River Estuary, immediately south of Cascade Head, is the second smallest estuary in Oregon with a watershed of 194 km 2 and a 3.5-km 2 estuary ( Figure 1D). Tidal wetlands in the Salmon River Estuary were estimated at 2.3 km 2 (Adamus et al. 2005). The mean, diurnal, and extreme tide ranges are 1.8, 2.5, and 5.2 m, respectively (U.S. Forest Service 1976). About 75% of the estuary was diked, primarily for agriculture, in the early 1960s (Frenkel and Morlan 1991). Most of the dikes have since been removed in accordance with restoration goals of Cascade Head Scenic Research Area and much of the estuary is tidal wetland. The high marsh site selected in the Salmon River Estuary (SR01, SR02, SR03, and SR04; Figure 1D (2009) auxiliary material, were interpolated using natural neighbor interpolation (Sibson 1981) for the Oregon coast ( Figure 2); uplift rates at each core location were determined from this interpolation. Mean uplift rates for Youngs Bay, Tillamook Bay, and the Salmon River Estuary were 2.2 \u00b1 0.1, 1.1 \u00b1 0.1, and 1.1 \u00b1 0.0 mm yr -1 , respectively (Table I), and are consistent with those published for the Astoria and South Beach NOAA tide gauges by Mazzotti et al. (2008). Though others have employed a single value for ESL change along the entire PNW coast in calculating RSL change (e.g., Komar et al. 2011), regionally specific ESL changes were used here to produce moderately more refined rates. Mazzotti et al. (2008) Table I. Estimates of RSL, calculated using the average uplift rate for each estuary, and sediment loads for each estuary. The standard deviations of the uplift rates and ESL errors were used in calculating RSL error by standard error propagation laws (Taylor 1997 Fortunately however, sediment yield, which is the river's load normalized to its drainage area (t km -2 yr -1 ), does not vary greatly amongst small, coastal rivers of the PNW (Karlin 1980). This is because Oregon watersheds, including the Youngs, Tillamook, and Salmon River, share similar characteristics such as geology, precipitation, and relief (Table I) that influence the magnitude of sediment delivered to the coastal ocean. Thus, we decided to determine a mean yield for the major rivers along the Oregon Coast based on available literature and apply this value in calculating each basin's load. This assumption is reasonable given that the differences in magnitude of sediment loads between each estuary was most relevant to this study rather than absolute load estimates. Published estimates of sediment yield from small mountainous rivers were tabulated for much of the Oregon Coast, from the Nehalem River in the north to the Coquille River in the south. Sediment yield averaged 120 \u00b1 30 t km 2 yr -1 , with a range of 62 -150 t km 2 yr -1 (Table II). Application of this yield to the 319 km 2 Youngs River watershed, 1290 km 2 Tillamook watershed, and 194 km 2 Salmon River watershed produced loads of 39 x 10 3 , 160 x 10 3 , and 24 x 10 3 t yr -1 , respectively ( Table I). The Tillamook drainage area excluded the Miami River tributary as it is unlikely to contribute significate sediment to core locations. Due to the large differences in area between these basins, Youngs Bay and Tillamook Bay experience sediment loads approximately 2 and 7 times greater than observed in the Salmon River Estuary (Table I)."}, {"section_title": "15", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Field sampling", "text": "Sampling took place during 2015. Sediment cores were collected within the tidal wetlands in the elevation range of 1.68 to 2.89 m from Youngs Bay (n = 5) Tillamook Bay (n = 6), and the Salmon River Estuary (n = 4; Table III). Youngs Bay and Tillamook Bay cores were taken from low marsh, high marsh, and scrub-shrub tidal wetlands; in the Salmon River Estuary, cores were only collected in the high marsh. Coring locations were selected based on field reconnaissance and review of available data, including elevation, aerial photographs, vegetation, and sediment survey maps. PVC pipes that were 10-cm in diameter and either 1.5-m or 3-m in length, were first driven into the wetland using a sledge hammer. Elevations of sediment surface immediately surrounding the cores were made using a Real Time Kinematic (RTK) GPS (Table III). A truck jack attached via a pipe clamp was used to extract the cores. Both a stainless-steel core catcher riveted to the driving end of the core and a mechanical test plug inserted at the top of the sediment column helped prevent sediment loss during core retrieval. In the field, each long core was cut into two ~1.5 m sections using a pipe cutter. Cores were upright during transport back to the laboratory. "}, {"section_title": "CT analysis", "text": "Soon after collection, all core sections were scanned at 0.5-mm resolution using a Toshiba Aquilion 64-slice Computed Tomography (CT) unit in Oregon State University's Veterinary Hospital. CT imaging provides non-destructive, high-resolution, 3D views of sediment stratigraphy that include physical and biogenic sedimentary structures (e.g., Davey et al. 2011). Because X-ray attenuation primarily varies with the gravimetric density of a material, CT imaging can also be used to quantify sediment bulk density. Denser materials attenuate X-rays more than less dense ones and result in lower grayscale values. We sought to determine a relationship between CT-derived grayscale value and density to calculate sediment bulk densities within the core samples. The CT scans were stored as image stacks in Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) file format. Image stacks were processed using Fiji, a distribution of the opensource software ImageJ developed by the National Institutes of Health (Schneider et al. 2012). Following conversion to Tagged Image File Format (tiff), the stacked images were adjusted from a 12-bit Hounsfield unit (HU) range (-1024 to 3072) commonly used in medical imaging (Hendee and Ritenour 1992) to an 8-bit range (0 to 255) to complete other image processing procedures. Undecomposed large roots and rhizomes had to be removed from the stacked images as they do not contribute to sediment bulk density. A Fiji plugin, \"Trainable Weka Segmentation\", segmented the image into two classifications, sediment and live plant material based on standard training features (Arganda-Carreras et al. 2014). These segmentations were visually verified in each image stack. The live plant material field was subtracted from the original image stack and the mean grayscale value of the sediment was determined for each 1-mm image slice in the axial plane. These mean grayscale values were then averaged for each 2-cm vertical increment. Others have derived a linear relationship between X-ray attenuation and density using calibration rods of known gravimetric density (e.g., Davey et al. 2011). However, X-ray attenuation additionally depends on the chemical composition of the scanned material with higher atomic numbers producing greater attenuation, and the calibration rods may fail to incorporate the influence of such sedimentary components. For instance, iron sulfides, which are often common in tidal wetlands, produce disproportionally high grayscale values causing an overestimation of sediment bulk density. Thus, gravimetric density of the sediment was analytically determined and compared to the CT-derived grayscale values. After the cores had been split lengthwise, dry bulk density was measured by weighing a 0.5 or 1.0 cm 3 sediment sample extracted by a syringe every 2 cm for the top ~50 cm of each core before and after 24 h in a 60 \u00b0C drying oven. Salt in the pore water was not corrected for as it accounted for less than 1.9% of the wet weight or less than 3.2% of the dry weight. The measured dry bulk densities could then be compared with the corresponding mean grayscale values."}, {"section_title": "Sediment analysis", "text": "The other halves of the split cores were sampled at 2-cm increments and freeze dried. Large plant material was removed with forceps and the dried sediment was ground to a consistent texture using a mortar and pestle.

(2001): 1.000 \u00b1 0.001 g of dried, disaggregated sediment was weighed into a crucible, burned at 550 \u00b0C for 4 h, and reweighed after cooling. LOI derived OM was correlated with C org by measuring a subset of samples by elemental analysis (e.g., Craft et al. 1991;Go\u00f1i and Thomas 2000).

Although also delivered to the wetland surface via atmospheric fallout, 137 Cs is an anthropogenic radionuclide produced during nuclear fission and was first released into the environment during nuclear weapons testing around 1954. Input of 137 Cs reached a maximum preceding the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in 1963. Within a sediment column, the first appearance and largest peak of 137 Cs are thus 1954 and 1963, respectively. Accounting for the depth of bioturbation, the depth of accumulated sediment since these time points provides an estimate of S (Ritchie and McHenry 1990). 20"}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "CT scans", "text": "CT images showed that the sediment cores were in good shape following extraction and transport as many biogenic and sedimentary structures typical of wetland sediment were well   Binned CT X-ray attenuation measured on an 8-bit grayscale (0-255) had a significant positive relationship with dry bulk density (Figure 4). This exponential regression was used to calculate dry bulk density from the CT scans when direct measurements had not been collected or were not valid, such as core DP02, which had desiccated during other laboratory procedures. Figure 4. The relationship between dry bulk density (0 12 ) measured gravimetrically every 2 cm for the top ~50 cm of each core and CT-derived 8-bit grayscale value (0-255) measured in the corresponding increments. Data (n = 301) were binned into five grayscale units (e.g., 55-60, 60-65, 65-70, etc.). The point from bin 60-65 was not included because only one datum fell within this range. The vertical and horizontal error bars represent the standard deviations of the average dry bulk density and CT grayscale value in each bin, respectively. Density profiles within the top 50 cm of most cores showed a slight trend towards increasing with depth ( Figure 5) due to greater decay of less-dense OM in older sediments and self-weight consolidation. Like the CT scans, little down-core variability was present within the Youngs Bay bulk density profiles apart from DP01 ( Figure 5A).

This relationship was applied to all core samples to convert OM to C org . Interval C org values ranged from as high as 40% in core GP02 to as low as 1.0% in core BM01. Figure 6.

Orange, green, and blue points refer to Youngs Bay, Tillamook Bay and the Salmon River Estuary, respectively. The quadratic relationship between C org and OM is explained by the relationship between C org and nitrogen (N; Figure 7). Sediments that are enriched in OM are subject to greater remineralization by heterotrophic bacteria and detritivores, which require macro-nutrients such as N. As OM becomes enriched in high C org content compounds (e.g., refractory organic compounds, fatty acids, and methane) through decomposition, the ratio of C org :OM increases while the ratio of N: C org decreases.

Organic carbon in cores from Youngs Bay ( Figure 8A; CS03 and WY04) and Tillamook Bay ( Figure 8B; BM01 and DSI01) show no change within the top 50 cm, however. In the cases of WY04 and BM01, their low marsh position may hinder much autochthonous OM production. Sediment carbon density (0 : ;<= ; g cm -3 ) was measured within the top 50 cm of each core as the product of dry bulk density and C org .  "}, {"section_title": "Radiochronologies and accumulation rates", "text": "Surface activities of 210 Pb xS ranged widely from 53 -514 Bq kg -1 and penetration depths ranged from 16 -90.5 cm (Figure 9, 10, and 11). Except for two cores, BM01 ( Figure 10A) and DSI02 ( Figure 10D), that displayed nonsteady state accumulation, profiles of 210 Pb xS activity with depth approximated an idealized profile (MacKenzie et al. 2011) and were readily interpretable (Figure 9, 10, and 11). Guidelines were developed to determine which intervals should be included in the regression to calculate Ss. Intervals with counting errors ranging below the detection limit of the \u03b3-ray spectrometers (3 Bq kg -1 ) were excluded. 27 wetlands may have prevented much mixing; as stated above, the CT images lack many obvious burrows and often exhibit complex root and rhizome matrixes (e.g., Figure 3 G -P). Three cores had surface sediment organic contents that diluted the lithogenic component causing low 210 Pb xS activities (GP01, DP01, and DP03); these data were omitted, as well. Multiple profiles exhibit outliers due either to a change in lithology or possible non-local bioturbation, which were additionally excluded from the regression equation (e.g., SR03, BM02, DSI01, and DP02). Less than 25% of the data points were excluded from the regressions. The mean accretion rates for the high marsh and scrub-shrub wetland sites in Youngs Bay, Tillamook Bay, and the Salmon River Estuary were 2.7 \u00b1 0.6, 2.2 \u00b1 0.3, and 2.4 \u00b1 0.7 mm yr -1 , respectively. There is no evidence that these means are different (one-way ANOVA, p = 0.5) and thus the mean S for all three estuaries is 2.4 \u00b1 0.5 mm yr -1 (n = 12). Many of the cores either had no 137 Cs activities above the detection limit or exhibited anomalous 137 Cs profiles indicative of post depositional remobilization (Foster et al. 2006), in which the activity peaked at or near the sediment surface and was much higher (40 -320 Bq kg -1 ) than expected given unaltered sorption. However, the cores that displayed exceptionally fast sediment accumulation (>10 mm yr -1 ) had preserved 137 Cs profiles (e.g., BM01, DSI02, WY04; Figure 12). Because the 210 Pb profiles of BM01 and DSI02 show nonsteady state deposition, the 137 Cs calculated Ss have been used. The WY04 core however showed good agreement between dating methods and thus these independently calculated Ss were averaged. Three cores collected within low marsh, WY04, BM01, and DSI02, exhibited high Ss, 12 \u00b1 1, 10 \u00b1 3, and >18 mm yr -1 respectively. Historical aerial photographs reveal that these tidal wetlands have been expanding horizontally (Brophy pers comm. 2016). These rapidly accreting, low marsh sites were not included in mean estimates of Ss. The Daggett Point site DP01 was additionally excluded in mean high marsh accretion rate calculations since it was collected in low marsh though it did not exhibit rapid accretion. Mass accumulation rate (MAR; g m -2 yr -1 ) was calculated from the slope ( "}, {"section_title": "32", "text": "(one-way ANOVA, p = 0.7). The average MAR for all three estuaries is 0.94 \u00b1 0.31 kg m -2 yr -1 (Table IV). Carbon mass accumulation rates (CARs; g C org m -2 yr -1 ) were calculated as the product of S and carbon density averaged over the accumulation rate depth (Callaway et al. 2012). Low marsh cores (i.e., DP01, WY04, BM01, and DSI02) were additionally excluded from calculation of the mean CARs in each estuary. Youngs Bay, Tillamook Bay, and the Salmon River Estuary exhibited on average 87 \u00b1 35, 85 \u00b1 19, and 110 \u00b1 30 g C org m -2 yr -1 , respectively; these means are not statistically different (one-way ANOVA, p = 0.4). The average CAR for all three estuaries is 94 \u00b1 33 g C org m -2 yr -1 (Table IV) Lastly, mineral deposition rate (MDR; g m -2 yr -1 ) was calculated as the product of S and the average mineral density averaged over the accumulation rate depth (Callaway et al. 2012). Mineral densities were calculated as the product of dry bulk density and lithogenic fraction (i.e., 1-LOI) of each 2-cm increment. The average MDRs are not different between estuaries (one-way ANOVA, p = 0.7); the mean for all locations is 670 \u00b1 250 g m -2 yr -1 (Table IV), excluding low marsh cores.  Mazzotti et al. 2008), but unfortunately uplift rates and therefore RSL have not been verified. Additionally, calculation of the relative sediment loads for each estuary assumed they had similar watershed sediment yields. Though precipitation and relief are quite similar between systems, Tillamook Bay has a higher mean basin elevation indicating a larger potential for sediment erosion (Table I), whereas Youngs Bay has a much higher ratio of sedimentary to igneous lithology compared to the other watersheds. This difference in lithology could mean that the yield of the Youngs Bay watershed is higher. Despite the difficulties associated with calculating sediment load, the vast difference in watershed size supports the general trend of Tillamook having the largest sediment supply and the Salmon River having the smallest. Suspended sediment concentration, rather than fluvial sediment load, may however have been a more apt comparison to sea level rise in studying tidal wetland accretion (e.g., Kirwan et al. 2016;Morris et al. 2016).  1972, 1964, 1996, and 2007, drastically increase sediment to the coastal ocean (Kniskern et al. 2011). Humans have additionally influenced fluvial sediment dynamics. From 1931 to 1954, a series of wildfires associated with logging burned 707 km 2 of forest in the Tillamook basin, enhancing sediment supply by 29% (Komar 2004). Damming in the PNW may limit sediment flux to periods of high water (Karlin 1980) and decrease sediment output; as evidence, damming on the Columbia River has primarily caused the estimated 60% decrease in sediment flux (Borde et al. 2003). Clearly, an average annual sediment load may be too simplistic, so perhaps the episodic nature of sediment supply could be linked by future studies to patterns of sediment deposition and accumulation using more immediate measurements of elevation change. For instance, sedimentation-erosion tables (SETs) provide both event-based measurements and long-term trends of sediment accretion . In determining mean accumulation rates representative of an estuary's tidal wetlands, heterogeneity within the wetland environment necessitates comprehensive sampling. Though only 16 cores were collected between the three estuaries, there is good agreement in accumulation rates 36 for each estuary's high marsh and scrub-shrub tidal wetland locations. A Grubbs test for statistical outliers revealed no outliers (\u03b1 = 0.05) amongst high elevation cores. In most cores, excepting WY04, we have used only one age dating technique -210 Pb xS or 137 Cs. When sedimentation is rapid, such as 10 \u00b1 3 and >18 mm yr -1 observed in BM01 and DSI02, 137 Cs appears more resistant to remobilization caused by changes in pore water redox chemistry (Figure 12), but 210 Pb xS profiles do not permit estimates of sediment accumulation (Figure 10 A and D). Slower, steadier rates of accumulation (i.e. 1.7 -3.4 mm yr -1 ) result in less changes in lithology and 210 Pb xS profiles that logarithmically decrease with depth, but allow post-depositional remobilization of 137 Cs. Although multiple authors have suggested 210 Pb may be mobilized due to redox processes during early diagenesis or due to aerobic degradation of OM (Allen et al. 1993), 210 Pb is less mobile than 137 Cs within tidal wetland environments due to its complexation with sulfur to form PbS (Crusius and Anderson 1991). Though there has been remobilization of 137 Cs it is unlikely that this is the case for 210 Pb. The validity of the method combined with the readily interpretable radionuclide profiles add considerable weight to our calculated rates of accumulation, and the derived rates (i.e., MAR, CAR, and MDR)."}, {"section_title": "Sediment accretion rates", "text": "Comparison of the two estuaries with the greatest difference in sediment load -Tillamook Bay and the Salmon River Estuary -can best determine whether RSL change or sediment supply primarily controls the formation and growth of tidal wetlands. Tillamook Bay and the Salmon River Estuary differ by a factor of greater than 7 in sediment load; however, 20 th century RSL rise has been statistically similar in these regions, 1.8 \u00b1 0.4 and 2.2 \u00b1 0.3 mm yr -1 respectively. The mean Ss within these two estuaries, 2.2 \u00b1 0.3 mm yr -1 in Tillamook Bay and 2.4 \u00b1 0.7 mm yr -1 in the Salmon River Estuary, are not only also statistically similar (one-way ANOVA, p = 0.6), but vary with the slight difference in RSL rise. This pattern suggests that increased hydroperiods and accommodation space created under RSL rise principally controls vertical accretion within northern Oregon tidal wetlands. Youngs Bay, which has an approximately stable sea level (0.28 \u00b1 0.44 mm yr -1 ), currently accretes at a mean rate of 2.7 \u00b1 0.6 mm yr -1 , which is about 9 times faster than the estimated RSL rise. Though not statistically significant, this mean S is larger than that observed in Tillamook which has a 4-fold greater sediment load. This suggests our initial assumptions about Youngs Bay RSL and sediment supply may be incorrect. Underestimation of the relative rate of sea level rise within Youngs Bay is a possibility. The record of ESL change in this region of the PNW coast is primarily based on the nearby Astoria gauge. Enhanced elevation of local sea level by the Columbia River outflow may invalidate use of the 0.30 \u00b1 0.22 mm yr -1 rate of ESL rise (Mitchell et al. 1994). Moreover, the interpolated uplift rates rely on a small number of benchmarks, and the sites in which CS02 and CS03 were collected are 8.5 km from the closest benchmarks ( Figure 2). Alternatively, we may have not accurately estimated the relative sediment supply to the Youngs Bay system. The large ratio of sedimentary to igneous rocks in the watershed may lead to greater sediment yield. Youngs Bay may additionally be experiencing increased sediment supply from the Columbia River system. However, it is unlikely that either RSL rise within Youngs Bay is 2.3 mm yr -1 higher or that sediment supply is greater than in Tillamook Bay. As previously stated, our consideration of sediment load rather than suspended sediment concentration may be the culprit. Youngs Bay may in fact have a higher mean suspended sediment concentration than Tillamook Bay, causing the elevated Ss. Similar, future studies should focus on less complicated systems."}, {"section_title": "PNW tidal wetlands resilience", "text": "The average S for each estuary is greater than each region's estimated RSL rise. However, both Tillamook Bay and Salmon River Estuary exhibit cores (i.e., 1.8 \u00b1 0.1 mm yr -1 at GP02, and 1.7 \u00b1 0.4 mm yr -1 at SR03) with sediment accretions lower than their associated sea level rise (1.8 \u00b1 0.4 and 2.2 \u00b1 0.3 mm yr -1 , respectively), though consideration of the accompanying error indicates overlap in values (Table IV). Interestingly, the reasons for these deviations seem to be very different. In the case of the Tillamook core, GP02 sits at the highest elevation, meaning it experiences the shortest hydroperiod and thus the shortest timeframe during which sediment can accumulate. It is possible that as sea level continues to rise, this location will begin accreting faster. Moreover, though this site has the lowest S, its CAR is greater than the other Tillamook Bay cores at steady state with RSL. Wetland habitats that sit high in the tidal frame experience less mineral loading than those lower in elevation, and thus organic accretion is often greater (Morris et al. 2016). Conversely, SR03 sits at the lowest elevation amongst the Salmon River coring locations. SR03 is the closest to a large channel and thus may be slightly erosional. To investigate this possibility, inventories of 210 Pb xS (Q, Bq cm -2 ) were calculated as: where \u03c1 i is the dry bulk density, h i is the thickness of the interval, and A i is the activity at the ith depth interval (Cochran et al. 1998). The Salmon River cores had an average inventory of 0.41 \u00b1 0.07 Bq cm -2 , yet SR03 had the lowest inventory of 0.35 \u00b1 0.03 Bq cm -2 . Minor erosion of up to 33% may therefore be possible. Alternatively, larger grain size within the sediment core, possibly given its location near the channel, would reduce the 210 Pb xS inventory; however, the dry bulk density profiles ( Figure 5C) show no striking differences between the lithologies of the Salmon River cores. The three cores with exceptionally high Ss (BM01, DSI02, and WY04) are all located within low marsh. The capacity for low elevation regions of Oregon tidal wetlands to accrete 5 times greater than high marsh areas highlights the potential for these environments to persist under accelerated RSL rise. Kirwan et al. (2016) note that vertical accretion within lower elevations may be the best indication of tidal wetland resilience under future rates of sea level rise. This is because high marsh regions vertically accrete to a high elevation within the tidal frame, thereby reducing frequent flooding, but low marsh regions are often inundated, simulating the stress of accelerated RSL. If these areas continue accreting under such stress, the tidal wetland may avoid future drowning. The low marsh Youngs Bay core, DP01 had a S of 2.3 \u00b1 0.4 mm yr -1 ; though this site is not accreting as rapidly as the other low marsh core collected in Youngs Bay (WY04), it is still 8 times faster than the estimated RSL rise in this region. Kirwan et al. (2010) (Ewald and Brophy 2012). Considering an average mass accumulation over this entire area of 930 g m -2 yr -1 , about 21 x 10 3 t of sediment are deposited on tidal wetlands each year. With an estimated sediment load of 160 x 10 3 t yr -1 , most sediment is exported to the shelf each year. Tidal wetlands in the Salmon River estuary, which has the greatest tidal wetland area relative to estuarine area in Oregon, were estimated at 2.3 km 2 (Adamus et al. 2005). The MAR of 980 g m -2 yr -1 results in 2.5 x 10 3 t of sediment deposited on the wetland annually. The estimated sediment load for the Salmon River Estuary is 39 x 10 3 t yr -1 , so that most fluvial sediment, 36 x 10 3 t yr -1 , is also exported to the shelf. All else being equal, it does not appear that wetland accretion in Oregon estuaries will be sediment limited. This is in stark contrast to estuaries along the U.S. East and Gulf Coasts (Weston 2014). Rates of ESL rise projected by the National Research Council (NRC; 2012) in Newport, OR are summarized in Table V. The projected rate is the mean value presented by Pardaens et al. (2011) and the worst-case scenario value was calculated from the range provided by the IPCC (2007). Assuming these values are representative of the northern portions of the coast and assuming coastal uplift rates remain constant, RSL rise rates were calculated for the three estuaries, as well. Current RSL rise calculated for Youngs Bay is the same as the NRC's projected value of 0.30 mm yr -1 , but Tillamook Bay's current RSL rise rate is more similar to the worst-case scenario value for 2000 to 2030. If Tillamook Bay and the Salmon River Estuary maintain steady state with RSL rise, mean Ss within these tidal wetlands will likely reflect the NRC's projected rates of RSL increase. Additionally, because CARs tend to reflect Ss (Chmura et al. 2003), CARs may also increase proportionally to rates of RSL rise. Thus, if the worst-case sea level rise scenario proves correct, carbon burial may increase by 500 and 410% for Tillamook Bay and the Salmon River estuary, respectively. Limits to autochthonous carbon production will assuredly dampen CARs, though (Morris et al. 2016). Puget Sound is a partially urbanized fjord having lost 70% of its wetlands (Emmett et al. 2000). Mean sediment carbon density measured within these sites averaged 0.032 \u00b1 0.008 g cm -3 , similar to the global mean of 0.039 \u00b1 0.003 g cm -3 for tidal wetlands (Chmura et al. 2003). However, the mean carbon burial rate for the three estuaries, 94 \u00b1 33 g C org m -2 yr -1 , is less than half the global burial flux of 245 \u00b1 26 g C org m -2 yr -1 and roughly two times less than the 173 \u00b1 45 g C org m -2 yr -1 calculated for the northeast Pacific region based on California data (Ouyang and Lee 2014). Chmura et al. (2003) found that sediment accretion rates were the primary contributing factor to carbon burial, and so the relatively low rates of CAR observed in these tidal wetlands can be attributed to low Ss due to below average mean RSL rise rates. Establishing vertical accretion rates and whether Oregon tidal wetlands are in steady state with RSL rise is therefore vital in predicting carbon burial potential. Though the CARs for Tillamook Bay and the Salmon River Estuary are statistically similar (one-way ANOVA, p = 0.1), the mean value for the Salmon River Estuary is slightly greater (Table   IV). C org accretion may thus be slightly affected by the available sediment load, but because the dominant factor affecting the CAR is the S (Chmura et al. 2003), which is a function of RSL, no strong correlation is expected. Interestingly, Youngs Bay, which had the fastest S had a statistically similar mean CAR (one-way ANOVA, p = 0.4). Additionally, though its RSL rise was the slowest, the mean MDR was statistically similar to the mean MDRs in Tillamook Bay and the Salmon River Estuary (one-way ANOVA, p = 0.7). This is not surprising given the similar mean Ss measured in the three estuaries; however, it means that even when out of steady state with RSL rise, CAR and MDR are still primarily impacted by S. The slightly smaller values may be due to rapid accretion that has not yet allowed for significant compaction."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions and future work", "text": "\u2022 Despite a sevenfold difference in sediment loads, Tillamook Bay and the Salmon River Estuary exhibit similar sediment accumulation rates that approximate RSL rise rates within each estuary. Therefore, RSL rise appears to control vertical accretion. This conclusion is further supported when considering that sediment accretion rates reflect RSL rise in Tillamook Bay despite the dramatic increase in sediment supply during the mid-century wildfires. \u2022 Though experiencing 0.28 \u00b1 0.44 mm yr -1 RSL rise, Youngs Bay high marshes are accreting at 2.7 \u00b1 0.6 mm yr -1 . It appears that either we have miscalculated sea level rise within this region, or an additional source of sediment has heightened accretion in Youngs Bay tidal wetlands. \u2022 Rapid accretion measured within several low elevation cores and export of excess suspended sediment from the estuaries suggest Oregon wetlands will be resilient in the face of future accelerated RSL rise rates. \u2022 Vertical accretion and thus RSL rise appears to additionally control C org burial rates as evidenced by similar mean CARs in Tillamook Bay and the Salmon River Estuary. Because RSL rise along the Oregon coast is less than global rates and the areal extent of these tidal wetlands is small, the PNW likely does not sequester C org at a globally significant magnitude.  Sediment load for the Wilson River was calculated as 240 x 10 3 t yr -1 , producing a yield of 480 t km -2 yr -1 . These values were similar to those calculated by Komar et al. (2004). The 1290 km 2 drainage area, which excludes the Miami River tributary as it is unlikely to contribute significant sediment to core locations, has a calculated load of 620 x 10 3 t yr -1 . This value is four times greater than the load calculated from the mean PNW yield (160 x 10 3 t yr -1 ; Table I). Compared to other PNW fluvial sediment yields, this value is anomalously high and should thus not be applied to other streams both within the Tillamook Bay watershed and other basins within Oregon. Estimation of load for the three estuaries using the assumed mean PNW yield is a more conservative method and should be considered more accurate until either the USGS collects more sediment concentration samples or an obvious cause of high load within the Wilson River is elucidated. ) R 2 = 0.45 cm -2 . Thus, though there may be an additional source of 210 Pb to the wetland sediment, the average is in relatively good agreement with the expected 210 Pb xS inventories if the radionuclide is primarily supplied by atmospheric flux. Moreover, the CRS method is further validated given the coarse sampling resolution (2 cm), which spans multiple years (Bellucci et al. 2007), and an obvious benefit of the CRS model is its detailed history of accretion rate change. Unlike the CIC method, the CRS model provides a detailed history (< 150 yr) of accumulation rates by calculating ages at each sampling interval (2 cm): where Q z is the inventory of 210 Pb xS below z (Bq cm -2 ), Q 0 is the total inventory of 210 Pb xS , and t is the age at z (cm). The equation can be rearranged to solve for t at each depth interval: and lastly the interval accretion rate (\u03c9) at each z can be calculated: (eq. 9) Underestimation of the 210 Pb Xs inventory is an inherent issue associated with the CRS model. As sediments advect downwards and age, 210 Pb Xs decays eventually falling below current instrument detection limits (3 Bq kg -1 ). This so called \"old date error\" (Binford 1990) can however be corrected. Assuming relatively constant sedimentation, the activity at which t is 200 yr (Gonnea 2016) can be calculated by: (eq. 10). Integration of each 210 Pb xS plot to the A 200 depth yields estimates of activities much lower in the profile that fall under the \u03b3-ray spectrometer detection limit. Included in the 210 Pb Xs inventories, these activities provide more accurate estimates of age and thus interval accretion rate (Figure 14)."}, {"section_title": "57", "text": "Accuracy of each value likely increases with depth as the percent contribution of these estimated values to Q z increases. Theoretical accretion rates calculated below each profile's detection limit were not included in average Ss. There exist multiple methods for calculating MARs using the CRS model (Sanchez-Cabeza and Ruiz-Fern\u00e1ndez 2012). Sanchez-Cabeza et al. (2000) suggest use of equation: which can be simplified to: where \u2206t is the formation time ( Figure 15). This simplification does not yield different values but slightly over-estimates the associated error. CARs and MDRs were calculated using the depth averaged fraction of C org and 1-LOI, respectively (Table VI). within the last half century. However, an apparent increase in sedimentation is remarkably common in studies using the CRS model, causing some to question whether bias inherent to the method may be dictating recent Ss (Gonnea 2016). Correction of the 210 Pb Xs inventory to ~200 yr weakens the dramatic rise in recent Ss by increasing older Ss. However, lower dry bulk densities towards the sediment surface likely drives the observed increase in recent Ss to a greater degree. As sediments move downwards within the profile, they consolidate and compact resulting in increased dry bulk density with depth. Hence the apparent decrease in linear sedimentation over time. Though this phenomenon is truly occurring and thus should not be corrected for, the CRS model is not an appropriate model for determining mean Ss over the past century. Depth averaged MARs calculated by the CRS model were, however, not statistically different from those calculated by the CIC model (paired t-test; two sided p-value = 0.4; Table   VII). Because the calculation of MARs accounts for changes in bulk density with depth, it is unsurprising that these values are consistent between models. Changes in mass accumulation within the estuaries over the past century can therefore be evaluated using the CRS model. There was moderate (two-sided p-value = 0.03; Table VII) and strong (two-sided p-value = 0.005; Table VII) evidence that CARs and MDRs were different, respectively. Such a result is surprising since both calculations incorporate changes in density with depth. Given these differences in Ss, CARs, and MDRs calculated by the CRS and CIC models, use of the CRS model should focus on changes in MARs over the past century. law equation. Oregon wetland sediment must therefore be particularly susceptible to OM sorption to clay minerals; as a result, this OM may be relatively resistant to remineralization. Inclusion of Oregon wetland data into this relationship will alter any empirical relationship calculated between bulk density and organic content. For instance, the new power law becomes # QR = 3.49LOI -0.80 (R 2 = 0.74) when both Oregon and the Morris et al. (2016) data are analyzed. Figure 16. Relationship between dry bulk density and percent OM measured by LOI for samples from this study (black dots, n = 302, wetlands = 3) compared with those presented by Morris et al.

The blue, dashed line is the power law calculated by the authors (R 2 = 0.73; # QR = 0.14LOI -0.59 ) and the red, dashed line is a best fit power law equation to the Oregon data (R 2 = 0.58, # QR = 3.12LOI -0.65 ).
