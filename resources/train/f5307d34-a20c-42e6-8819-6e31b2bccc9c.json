The CDR-SB is a sum of scores for the 6 CDR domains and has proven particularly useful in tracking disease progression and functional impairment over time. 17 Both regression models were adjusted for APOE \u03b54 because its distribution significantly varied across groups ( Table 1 and Table 2 ).

Within the 4 groups formed by cross-tabulating T-tau and A\u242442, we found that, compared with patients who have normal-TtauA\u242442, (1) those with abnormal-A\u242442 or abnormal-T-tauA\u242442 had a steeper rate of decline on the composite cognitive measure, whereas those with abnormal-Ttau did not; (2) those with abnormal-A\u242442 or abnormal-T-tauA\u242442 experienced a significant worsening of disease, whereas those with abnormal-T-tau did not; and (3) those with abnormal-A\u242442 or abnormal-T-tauA\u242442 were at increased risk of converting to AD dementia, whereas those with abnormal-T-tau were not any more likely to experience conversion to AD dementia. In summary, these analyses showed that patients with MCI who had abnormal-A\u242442, whether the T-tau was normal or not, had worse outcomes, whereas patients with MCI who had normal-A\u242442, even when the T-tau was abnormal, had comparatively better outcomes. Similar findings were made when the analyses were repeated within the 4 groups formed by p-tau 181 and A\u242442.\nOur manner of creating the CSF subgroups examined in this study is noteworthy. Recent studies 3, 21 have suggested that biomarker ratios may be more sensitive to incipient AD compared with absolute biomarker levels. However, by virtue of being ratios, such measures obscure an important distinction between individuals who have normaltau but abnormal-A\u242442 and those who have abnormaltau but normal-A\u242442. For instance, exploratory analyses in this study found that the abnormal-T-tau group (mean \n/ A\u242442 ratio (P=.77). In contrast to the apparent similarity of these 2 classes of MCI patients (ie, those with only abnormal-tau and those with only abnormal-A\u242442) on the biomarker ratios, our analyses showed that their prospective course and outcome are different. 22 The overall finding from this study is that, of the 2 types of CSF abnormalities commonly observed in patients with MCI (ie, increased T-tau or p-tau 181 and decreased A\u242442), abnormally low A\u242442 appears to be most closely associated with cognitive decline, disease progression, and risk of conversion to AD dementia. This finding is consistent with prior investigations 6, 19, 23 that found that CSF A\u242442 concentrations are predictive of future conversion to AD dementia among patients with MCI, whereas tau concentrations are not. Because abnormally low CSF A\u242442 is presumed to be due to \u2424-amyloid aggregation in the brain, 24 our findings are in accordance with the amyloid cascade hypothesis, which, in brief, argues that deposition of \u2424-amyloid in the brain is an early event in AD pathogenesis. 25 However, we note that the tenets of the amyloid cascade hypothesis remain controversial. 26 Indeed, some evidence exists that elevated CSF T-tau or p-tau 181 , but not decreased A\u242442, predict progression from MCI to AD dementia. 20 The reasons for these seemingly conflicting findings are not fully understood and suggest the need for continued investigation of these important questions. 2, 27 In addition, although our findings suggest that A\u242442 abnormities are prominently associated with risk of progression to dementia, all models tested in this study consistently demonstrated that individuals with combined tau and A\u242442 abnormalities had the worst outcomes. 3 This study contributes to the ongoing attempts to identify subgroups of patients with MCI at increased risk of progressing to AD dementia 3, 4 by demonstrating that patients with MCI who have abnormal A\u242442 have an elevated risk of cognitive decline and eventual conversion to AD dementia even when the tau is normal. The ability to detect incipient dementia in patients with MCI has obvious implications for clinical trials. One reason why MCI trials have experienced little success to date is the relatively slow disease progression among some study enrollees, which affects the ability of these trials to test key hypotheses. Enrolling patients with MCI who are more likely to convert to AD dementia could shorten the time to attain the primary milestones, reduce the sample size needed for adequate power, and increase the ability to detect treatment effects. 28 In addition, the finding that abnormal A\u242442 is comparatively more strongly associated with progressive decline and eventual conversion to AD suggests that the ability to abrogate the accumulation of A\u2424 peptides in the brain and/or restore A\u242442 in CSF might be a valid outcome for MCI drug trials, especially those in the phase 2 (proof-of-concept) stage. 29 An important caveat is that, in this ADNI cohort, individuals with abnormal A\u242442 were also more likely to possess 1 or more copies of the APOE \u03b54 allele and there is some evidence that APOE \u03b54 carriers might have differential therapeutic response or higher risk of treatmentrelated adverse effects. Currently no medications, to our knowledge, have been shown to delay the onset of dementia in patients with MCI. 31 However, novel and promising AD therapeutics are currently being tested in clinical trials. 2, 32 If these drugs prove to be therapeutic, there would be a viable role for biomarkers of incipient AD dementia in patients with MCI because these drugs are presumably more effective if administered early in the disease process. 2 Our findings would suggest that patients with MCI who have abnormal-CSF A\u242442 might be ideal candidates for such therapies because of their comparatively elevated risk of transitioning to AD dementia. In general, because CSF biomarkers putatively reflect biochemical processes in the brain, 5, 33 it is foreseeable that they could be used for matching patients to treatment approach (eg, CSF A\u242442 findings may be used to assign patients to treatments that target \u2424-amyloid plaques). 33 A potential limitation of this study is the small sample size of the group of patients with MCI who have abnormal T-tau, which resulted in an inability to reliably conduct some significance tests in this study. However, we note that the findings in the p-tau 181 -A\u242442 tetrad (in which the distribution of the groups was relatively more proportional) closely mirrored the findings in the T-tauA\u242442 models, thus lending credibility to the observations made in the T-tauA\u242442 groups. It would be of great interest to see whether this study's key finding-that abnormal A\u242442 is deleterious even when tau is normal-is replicable in other well-characterized and prospectively monitored cohorts of patients with amnestic MCI.
