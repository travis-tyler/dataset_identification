[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "In late 2019, a novel positive-sense RNA virus, family Coronaviridae, genus Betacoronavirus, and subgenus Sarbecovirus, emerged in the human population due to cross-species transmission from an unknown host (1, 2). The virus, SARS-CoV-2, began widespread circulation in the Chinese city of Wuhan in late December of 2019, with the first cases in other countries detected around mid-January 2020 (3, 4).\nArizona\u2019s first confirmed case of COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, was detected in late January 2020 in a student attending Arizona State University who had traveled to China (5). Extensive contact tracing and isolation led to zero additional reported cases stemming from this original case (AZ1). There were no additional cases reported in Arizona until 3 March, when a traveler returned from Europe and tested positive (6). On 6 March, the first case of community transmission in Arizona was announced (7). On 26 March, the Arizona Department of Health Services (AZDHS) updated the status of community transmission to \u201cwidespread.\u201d At the time of writing this paper, there were \u223c91,860 confirmed positive cases in Arizona, and more than 1,780 deaths (8), where the number of new cases and deaths per day increased by a factor of 10 and 4 over the previous 2 months, respectively (9). The Navajo Nation, located mostly in northeastern Arizona (but also Utah, Colorado, and New Mexico) had among the highest number of cases per capita in the United States: approximately 4,390 confirmed cases per 100,000 individuals (10). This rate was disproportionately high relative to the rest of Arizona (approximately 1,280 confirmed cases per 100,000 individuals), and about 200% of the per capita cases seen in the hardest-hit regions of the United States (e.g., New York [11]).\nGiven the scale of the pandemic, there is an urgent need to understand patterns of SARS-CoV-2 spread, including the relative roles of local transmission versus repeated travel-associated introductions, and the accumulation and spread of mutations that could affect the function of the virus, interfere with testing, or have antigenic effects that might impact vaccine efforts. Viral genome sequencing has emerged as a key tool for addressing these questions. In order to assist with both local and global efforts to track the spread and evolution of this virus, we began intensive sequencing of viral genomes from across Arizona and deposition of these sequences in the GISAID database, which makes them accessible to the research community for downstream analyses, notably including real-time pathogen tracking through Nextstrain (12).\nTo better understand the evolution of the virus within the state of Arizona, we compared our sequences with publicly available SARS-CoV-2 genomes from across the world in a phylogenetic framework, and we report here our preliminary findings. Specifically, we sought to answer three key questions regarding the circulation of the virus in Arizona. First, did the initial case of COVID-19 in Arizona lead to cryptic community transmission that helped to fuel the ongoing epidemic? (13) Second, how many independent introductions contributed to the outbreak in Arizona and what was the approximate timing of each event? Third, are there any unique mutations present in Arizona sequences that could have potential phenotypic effects or could interfere with diagnostic detection?"}, {"section_title": "The initial Arizona case did not lead to sustained local transmission. ::: RESULTS AND DISCUSSION", "text": "The first case of COVID-19 in Arizona (AZ1) was documented in late January 2020, and contact tracing suggested that this initial case did not result in additional symptomatic infections within the state (5). We sought to independently verify this conclusion using Bayesian and maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analyses to compare all 84 Arizona genomes to a representative subset of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes generated from around the world. The genomes used in this analysis were selected using a novel bioinformatics pipeline (see Materials and Methods), which subsampled genomes uploaded to GISAID to reduce the size of the data set while representing the temporal, spatial, and genetic diversity of the full data set. This resulted in a set of 388 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, including 84 Arizona genomes and 304 additional representatives (see Table S1). A reduced version of this data set, including 376 genomes with complete date information, was used in the Bayesian analysis.\nOur phylogenetic analyses (Fig. 1; see also Fig. S1) indicated that the genome from AZ1 belonged to lineage A (all lineage names are according to the Pangolin nomenclature [14]). Although 11/83 (13%) of the remaining Arizona genomes also clustered in lineage A, these genomes belonged to distinct sublineages (A.1, A.2, and A.3), and the AZ1 genome contained one derived substitution (C to T at nucleotide position 29,031) that we did not observe in any other Arizona sequences. This substitution was, however, shared with 12 other genomes included in our analysis, all of which were sampled in China or Japan. This is consistent with infection of AZ1 occurring during documented travel to China (5).\nAlthough our analyses cannot completely rule out the possibility of a cryptic transmission chain originating from this initial case, it is clear that the first documented introduction of SARS-CoV-2 to Arizona did not play a substantial role in fueling the ongoing epidemic. Rather, most Arizona cases are linked to later introduction events (see below). These results demonstrate the power of public health contact tracing and self-isolation following a positive test for stemming the tide of infections moving forward."}, {"section_title": "Multiple introductions have contributed to transmission in Arizona. ::: RESULTS AND DISCUSSION", "text": "Our phylogenetic analyses indicated that multiple distinct SARS-CoV-2 lineages cocirculated in AZ during March 2020. We detected 11 distinct lineages and/or sublineages in Arizona between early March and early April (Table 1), including one that was unnamed by Pangolin, but contained 13 Arizona genomes and 1 genome from Connecticut and was well-supported in both of our phylogenetic analyses (B.1.X). None of these lineages were unique to Arizona; they have all been documented in other parts of the United States and, in most cases, also in multiple countries around the world (Fig. 2 and 3; see also Fig. S2). In fact, the geographic ubiquity of the major SARS-CoV-2 lineages, along with the common observation of identical virus genomes sampled in multiple U.S. states, as well as other countries and continents, clearly demonstrates how frequently this virus has been moved among locales. Given the timing and size of the Arizona outbreak during the period of investigation, relative to outbreaks in other locations (Fig. 3), we argue it is unlikely that any of these 11 lineages arose within Arizona. Therefore, the number of observed distinct lineages (12, including AZ1) represents a conservative estimate for the number of independent introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into Arizona.\nTo estimate when community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 first began in Arizona, we used our Bayesian phylogenetic analysis to estimate dates for the times to most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) of the Arizona genomes within each of these lineages. In total, we sequenced \u22652 viral genomes from 7/12 of the observed lineages (which we name \u201cmajor lineages\u201d), and TMRCA estimates using these genomes (Fig. 2) suggest that, at the earliest, community transmission in Arizona began around early February 2020. However, we view this as the most extreme estimate because many of these lineages likely represent multiple distinct introductions to Arizona, rather than a single introduction followed by sustained community transmission. For example, the Arizona MRCA for B.1, the inferred oldest lineage containing Arizona genomes, effectively corresponds to the MRCA of the entire B.1 lineage because Arizona genomes assigned to this lineage are scattered throughout this portion of the tree and interspersed with genomes sampled from around the world (Fig. 1). Given the global distribution of this lineage and the high frequency of travel during this time period (15), there have almost certainly been multiple introductions of viruses from this lineage that have led to documented cases in Arizona, but which cannot be distinguished genetically. Therefore, the early February TMRCA likely predates actual community transmission within Arizona. Likewise, the other two lineages with TMRCAs in February (A.1 and B.1.1) both include at least one well-supported sublineage containing a mix of genomes from Arizona and from other locations.\nTo determine the most likely source of the SARS-CoV-2 introductions to Arizona, we examined the geographic distribution of sequences within each lineage (Fig. 3). For this analysis, we considered the full collection of SARS-CoV-2 genomes available on GISAID (as of 16 April 2020). First, for each of the seven major lineages, Arizona sequences were always sampled after a sequence from that same lineage or sublineage had been sampled elsewhere. Although sequencing efforts can influence this result, it appears unlikely that any of the major lineages emerged in Arizona; rather, they were likely imported. Second, there are very few sequences from Asia clustered within each of the major lineages. Instead, it appears importation was largely driven by domestic travel (in the case of A.1, B.1.2, and B.1.29), or perhaps imported from Europe (B.1 and B.1.1) or Oceania (A.3), although both B.1 and A.3 have also been commonly observed elsewhere in the United States. Given the widespread distribution of many nearly identical genomes, it would be impossible to directly estimate the location of each of these importations beyond the continent level.\nThe Arizona sequences are largely represented by two lineages, A.1 and B.1, including several sublineages of B.1. We focus the remaining results and discussion on these two lineages. A.1 was identified in Washington State in late February and has since spread across the globe (Fig. 3) (13). It was previously proposed that the A.1 Washington outbreak, announced on 28 February as the second instance of community transmission in the United States (16), is derived from the first Washington case, a lineage A sequence, back in January 2020 (13). For the purposes of our discussion, we only focus on the A.1 sublineage, which, regardless of the ultimate source of A.1, had begun circulating in Washington in the middle of February at the latest.\nEight of the Arizona genomes are members of the A.1 clade, and this includes sequences from at least five counties across Arizona (Table 1; see also Fig. S1). We infer that the MRCA of these Arizona sequences likely existed around 16 February 2020 (95% highest posterior density [HPD], 8 to 24 February). If these eight Arizona genomes stem from a single introduction of the A.1 lineage, this TMRCA estimate suggests the lineage was already present in Arizona prior to when community transmission was announced in Washington, on 29 February (Fig. 2). However, it is likely that the eight A.1 lineage genomes from Arizona arose from multiple introductions into the state, given that the same lineage was being spread throughout the country (15). Although multiple introductions could push the TMRCA estimate of the A.1 introduction to be more recent, we argue that epidemiological data support an initial importation of the A.1 lineage near the dates inferred.\nThe first A.1 Arizona genome we sequenced was from a sample collected on 5 March from a person who was a household contact of another case, representing the first known community transmission event in Arizona; the other individual tested positive on 3 March and held a health care job in Phoenix (their SARS-CoV-2 genome has not been sequenced) (38). The close epidemiological link between these cases suggests direct transmission of the virus, in which case the first documented example of community transmission in Arizona likely involved an A.1 lineage virus. Given the median incubation time of 5 days (17) and assuming the health care worker was infected by someone traveling directly from Washington with no additional transmission in between, that would place the time of importation to be approximately 28 February. This falls outside our 95% HPD TMRCA estimate of 24 February; however, this timeline makes it clear that even if multiple A.1 introductions caused the TMRCA to be artificially early, it is not by more than a week or two.\nOf the 84 Arizona genomes, 72 (85.7%) belong to the B.1 lineage (including the various B.1 sublineages), making B.1 the most abundant lineage in Arizona (as it is globally) (https://github.com/cov-lineages/lineages). Arizona sequences from this lineage were collected from 2 March to 2 April 2020 and were detected in samples from eight counties (Table 1). One of the substitutions that is present in all B.1 lineage viruses occurred in the gene for the spike protein and resulted in an aspartic acid-to-glycine substitution at residue 614 (D614G). Based on viral RNA quantifications from clinical samples, phylogenetic analyses, and in vitro experiments (18), it was recently suggested that this substitution may have increased the transmissibility of the virus. Although the outbreak in Arizona was already dominated by B.1 lineage viruses in early March 2020, we did see a gradual increase in the relative proportion of B.1 throughout March and into early April (Fig. 4A). We also compared reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) cycle threshold (CT) values for clinical samples with and without this substitution. Our results show a trend similar to that reported from patients in Sheffield, England (18), with a lower mean CT (higher viral load) in samples containing the D614G substitution; however, this is not a statistically significant difference (P = 0.85) with our current sample size (Fig. 4B). Combined, these data, along with those published by other groups (18\u201320), are consistent with a replication and/or transmission advantage of viruses containing the D614G substitution. However, demonstrating a viral mutation has an in vivo fitness advantage is difficult and in previous viral outbreaks has contradicted in vitro experiments (43, 44). An additional explanation is that the B.1 lineage has simply been increasing in frequency globally, due to chance events that led this lineage to dominate in early outbreaks (e.g., in Italy), from which the virus has been spread widely throughout the world and has seeded outbreaks in many other locations.\nThe B.1 lineage has also dominated the large outbreak in New York, and in some reports (39), the B.1 lineage has been used as an indication of an epidemiological link to the New York outbreak. However, we would urge caution with this approach. Based on ancestral state reconstructions, this lineage is predicted to have first emerged in Asia or Europe (Nextstrain), and this lineage was observed in multiple European countries, including the large Italian outbreak, before it was first documented in New York (Nextstrain). In fact, just within Arizona, we have documented at least two instances in which B.1 lineage viruses were imported directly from Europe. The second case of COVID-19 in Arizona was reported on 3 March from a traveler who returned from France on 27 February (40). This individual self-reported being symptomatic on the plane back to Phoenix and went to multiple social gatherings before being officially diagnosed (41). At one of these social events, at least one other individual was infected (42). Virus from this individual was sequenced by the CDC (EPI_ISL_420784), and the genome belongs to the B.1 lineage (sublineage B.1.1; see Fig. S1). We also have records shared to us by the Coconino Health and Human Services Department that one of the B.1 genomes we sequenced from Coconino County came from an individual who had recently traveled to Rome, Italy, and who presumably was infected there. Thus, although it is tempting to speculate that most of the B.1 infections across the United States came from the New York outbreak, we show at least two confirmed instances of direct importation of B.1 into Arizona from Europe."}, {"section_title": "Nonsynonymous mutations of interest observed in Arizona SARS-CoV-2 sequences. ::: RESULTS AND DISCUSSION", "text": "Like all RNA viruses, SARS-CoV-2 accumulates mutations over time, some of which may impact virulence, replication, and intervention strategies and some of which have no functional, clinical, or antigenic importance. We identified nonsynonymous mutations in coding sequences of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Arizona (Fig. 5; see also Table S1). These include mutations in the spike protein, nonstructural proteins (nsps) involved in RNA synthesis, nucleocapsid protein, and the putative ORF10. Several of these mutations have also been reported as being associated with SARS-CoV-2 sequences from Europe (22). Below, we hypothesize about potential phenotypic impacts of these substitutions; however, it is important to note that experimental studies need to be conducted to test these hypotheses, and the vast majority of substitutions that occur during viral replication will not have a significant impact on virulence or transmissibility.\nAs the virus genome mutates there are several concerns, such as evasion of therapeutics and vaccines but also regarding diagnostics. In order to identify any mutations that could affect the specificity of currently used RT-PCR assays, an in silico approach was employed. A screen of 12 current primer/probe sets (Table S4) demonstrates that seven widely used assays are valid in this isolate set, yielding no predicted false negatives based on exact primer/probe matches. Several of the primers/probes align with stretches of \u201cN\u201d characters in individual genomes and the amplification potential is therefore ambiguous. Interestingly, the CDC nCoV_N1 assay demonstrates mismatches in six of the genomes screened in this study, including one genome from Arizona (TG271862, Cochise County). This is not a guarantee of future validity; however, automated in silico methods offer nearly effortless monitoring."}, {"section_title": "Spike. ::: RESULTS AND DISCUSSION", "text": "The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein mediates receptor binding and cell entry and is the primary target of neutralizing antibodies (23). Mutations in the spike protein may have implications for viral entry and recognition by the immune system. We found several mutations in the spike protein gene, including in two related isolates (TGEN-CoV-AZ-WMTS-TG268282 and TGEN-CoV-AZ-WMTS-TG271435) harboring an alanine to valine substitution at Spike amino acid residue 475 (A475V, nucleotide position 22986) in the receptor-binding domain (RBD). Structural studies indicate that A475 interacts with S19 of ACE2 (24, 25)."}, {"section_title": "Nsp12 and RNA synthesis complex. ::: RESULTS AND DISCUSSION", "text": "During replication of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome, RNA synthesis is driven by the key component nsp12 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase in complex with nsp7 and nsp8 (26, 27). Studies of SARS-CoV replication demonstrate that nsp14 regulates replication fidelity through its 3\u2032-to-5\u2032 exonuclease activity (28, 29). Mutations in nsp7, nsp8, nsp12, and nsp14 may therefore affect viral RNA synthesis and susceptibility to antiviral treatments such as remdesivir (30). We identified several nonsynonymous mutations in nsp7 residue 25 (S\u2192L) and 26 (S\u2192F), but none in nsp8 (Fig. 5B). One of the nsp12 mutations at residue 323 (P\u2192L) identified in 69 Arizona sequences was previously associated with SARS-CoV-2 sequences from Europe (22). We did not find nsp12 mutations at sites predicted to be the contact interface with remdesivir (30).

The N protein is also associated with replication-transcription complexes and facilitates template switching during viral subgenomic mRNA synthesis (32). N is expressed at high levels during early stages of replication and, like the S protein, is also a major immunogenic target of antibodies (33). Five AZ sequences had a triple nucleotide substitution (GGG\u2192AAC) that resulted in a tandem amino acid change in the N protein at residues 203 and 204 (RG\u2192KR). Over the relatively short time frame of SARS-CoV-2 evolution, these tandem substitutions are relatively uncommon (22)."}, {"section_title": "ORF10. ::: RESULTS AND DISCUSSION", "text": "ORF10 is a short putative protein of unknown function, predicted in the 3\u2032 end of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, which is conserved in the closely related bat and pangolin coronavirus sequences (Fig. 5C). We identified a 2-nucleotide insertion in ORF10 within two AZ genomes that results in a premature stop codon and early truncation of ORF10. A similar truncation is present in the SARS-CoV genome due to the presence of an upstream stop codon. This may indicate a region of the virus genome with relaxed evolutionary constraints, consistent with a report that did not detect subgenomic ORF10 mRNA in vitro (34)."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions. ::: RESULTS AND DISCUSSION", "text": "Based on our phylogenetic analysis, it is clear that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak in Arizona has been fueled by multiple distinct introductions of SARS-CoV-2 to the state. We estimate a minimum of 11 introductions over the course of February and March, though this is surely an underestimate. By estimating the timing of introductions, we find no evidence for cryptic community transmission in Arizona prior to late January. Rather, our analyses indicate that community transmission likely did not occur within Arizona until at the earliest early- to mid-February, when viruses from lineages B.1 and A.1 may have been first introduced. It appears that most of the introductions of SARS-CoV-2 to Arizona have had domestic origins, in line with reports from other states (15); however, there have also been instances of Arizona cases linked directly to international travel, and these have likely also contributed to the local outbreak. Several nonsynonymous mutations were identified in the Arizona isolates, including within regions of the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein and nonstructural proteins involved in the RNA synthesis complex. However, we see very little evidence for mutations that will impact the most commonly used molecular diagnostics. The functional consequences of the observed mutations are unknown, highlighting the need for mechanistic studies. Our phylodynamic tracing provides unique epidemiological insights into the origins and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Arizona and will form the basis for future understanding as the pandemic continues."}, {"section_title": "Reference genome. ::: MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": "Any sequence positions mentioned in this work refer to GenBank sequence NC_045512.2, a genome isolated and sequenced from Wuhan, China, early in the pandemic."}, {"section_title": "TGen North genome sequencing. ::: MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": "RNA was extracted from specimen transport medium with a quick viral RNA kit (Zymo Research).
