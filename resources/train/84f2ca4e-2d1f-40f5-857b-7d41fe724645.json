[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "U.S. livestock farms are important contributors to American agricultural production. The largest livestock industry in the U.S. is the beef industry. Today, U.S. cattle production is more specialized than ever with concentration in feedlot cattle and cow-calf operations. Feedlot cattle production is concentrated in the High Plains states (Wyoming, South Dakota, Nebraska, Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas) and also in states such as Iowa and California (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency). Cow-calf operations are located in all 50 states, but are most concentrated in Tennessee, Missouri, Kentucky, Montana, South Dakota, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Kansas and Nebraska (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency). Most livestock production takes place on a large number of small farms. According to the 2007 U.S. Census of Agriculture Report, farms with fewer than 100 beef cows accounted for 90.4 percent of total U.S. farms with beef cows. Additionally, farms with fewer than 50 beef cows accounted for 79.4 percent of total U.S. farms with beef cows (NASS, 2007 Census of Agriculture). Beef cow-calf operations are generally operated on land that is not suitable for crop production and their production potential depends on range or pasture forage conditions (McBride and Mathews, 2011). U.S. beef cattle production includes three major stages: cow-calf, stocker, and finishing stages. Every U.S. state has the cow-calf segment of beef cow production, with a wide range of herd sizes (Gillespie et al., 2000). The stocker (backgrounding) phase gives flexibility to cow-calf producers for growing their calves to heavier weights. Beef animals in the feedlot finishing stage of the industry are fed forage and grain. They combine forage and grain until the calves gain enough weight to be slaughtered. According to McBride and Mathews (2011), the Southeast region has proportionately more cow-calf farms than the other regions, but the lowest production value per farm. The reason for this distinction is that most southeastern farms have smaller beef cow herd sizes compared with other regions. Pasture acreage used and stocking rates differ significantly by region. More than 90 percent of farms use private pasture land for grazing beef cattle. The Southeast has the lowest stocking rates, averaging three acres per beef cow (McBride and Mathews, 2011). The Southeastern U.S. beef cow-calf region includes Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. According to the 2007 U.S. Census of Agriculture Report, the southeastern states grazed over 7.8 million beef cows, almost 23.8 percent of the U.S. total beef cow herd (Table 1). As shown by the 2007 U.S. Census of Agriculture Report, 235,291 of 764,984 U.S. beef cow farms, or approximately 30.7 percent, are located in the Southeast (Table 1). Moreover, the Southeast has more farms with cow herd sizes of < 20, 20 to 49 or 50 to 99 compared with the West, the North Central, or the Northern Plains regions. The Southeast is well suited to producing beef cattle because of extended grazing periods for beef cow-calf production. This extended grazing period gives southeastern cow-calf producers the opportunity to keep calves on the pasture for an additional 2-3 months to put weight on calves after weaning. In addition, the extended grazing period decreases cow-calf producers' dependence on concentrated feedstuffs, adding value to calves with less expensive inputs compared to other regions. In some beef cattle production regions or states, it is not possible to graze year-round, thus such regions depend on the use of conserved or stockpiled forages during a few months of the year. There has been little research on the scale economies in southeastern beef production from the perspective of the whole farm or the farm household. Similarly, there has been little research on the technical and scale efficiencies of beef cow-calf production systems from the perspective of the whole farm or the farm household. The primary goal of this study is to measure the technical and scale efficiencies at the whole farm level for cow-calf operations in the Southeastern U.S. In addition, we examine the link between cowcalf farm efficiency and output diversification (off-farm income)."}, {"section_title": "Literature", "text": "Over the past few decades, major structural and technological changes have taken place in the U.S. agricultural sector. In particular, the increased tendency to move toward larger farms has been the concern of survivability of small farms in a competitive market. Studies have examined the economic performance of U.S. Corn Belt farms (Morrison-Paul et al., 2004;Morrison-Paul and Nehring, 2005) and explored the potential competitiveness of small versus large farms. Overall, large farms have been shown to have cost advantages over small farms. These studies have estimated output and input distance functions using stochastic frontier techniques. A few studies have examined European beef cattle farm technical efficiency and profitability (Iraizoz et al., 2005;Trestini, 2006). Samarajeewa et al., (2012) estimated economic performance of cow-calf operations in Alberta, Canada. Little research has estimated economic performance measures and technical efficiencies of U.S. cow-calf farms. Studies have estimated the technical, allocative and scale efficiencies of cow-calf farms using nonparametric linear programming-based or data envelopment analysis and parametric approaches (Featherstone et al., 1997;Rakipova, Gillespie and Franke, 2003;Nehring et al., 2009). Larger beef cow farms were more technically efficient than smaller beef cow farms and herd sizes of farms up to 48 beef cows exhibited substantial economies of scale (Featherstone et al., 1997). Rakipova, Gillespie and Franke (2003) focused on the discussion of technical efficiency and the effect of cow-calf farms' characteristics, management, and production practices on technical efficiency. Use of an input distance function allowed Nehring et al. (2009) to relate multiple outputs to multiple inputs in a single equation to measure technical and scale efficiencies. Small cow-calf farms could be competitive as long as producers had substantial off-farm income. The present study attempts to quantify economic performance of the southeastern cow-calf farms. We focus on input and output jointness and their complementarities, including scope economies and input substitutability or complementarity."}, {"section_title": "Data Sources and Methods", "text": "This study uses the USDA's 2008 Agricultural Resource Management Survey We use an input distance function (IDF) analysis to determine the economic performance of cow-calf farms from a whole-farm production perspective, exploring the importance of output diversification economies in Southeastern U.S. cow-calf production. To estimate this function econometrically, we apply the stochastic production frontier. The whole farm IDF can be approximated by a translog functional form for empirical implementation in order to limit a priori restrictions on the relationship among inputs. To capture the relationship between inputs and outputs, the IDF requires homogeneity in input levels (F\u00e4re and Primont, 1995) and symmetry restrictions. After normalization (Lovell et al., 1994), this function results in: (1) can be written as where i denotes farms; k ,l the outputs; m, n the inputs; and q, r the farm characteristic variables. is land, specified as a normalization factor in inputs. ( ) is the distance from the frontier and it characterizes the technical inefficiency (TI) error, . TI is a function of farm-and farmer-specific characteristics. Technical efficiency (TE) can be obtained as the expectation of the term conditional on the composed error term (Jondrow et al., 1982). TE can be measured as: (3) We use single-step maximum likelihood (ML) methods (Battese and Coelli, 1995)  with truncation at zero of ( ) distribution, where \u2211 , is a vector of whole-farm efficiency determinants, and are unknown estimable parameters. The ARMS contains expansion factors or \"weight\" that can be used to expand the data to a population estimate. These weights are used in the analysis and robust standard errors an estimated in STATA to connect for heteroskedasticity."}, {"section_title": "Stochastic Production Frontier Results", "text": "The ML parameter estimates for the IDF model are presented in Table 2. The inputs have mixed signs. Total operating expenses ( ) have the expected sign but total capital expenditure ( ) and total labor expenses ( ) have unexpected signs. All input variables are significant expect for total capital expenditure. Output variables, gross value of farm production ( ) and total principal operator household off-farm income ( ), are significant. We find that total capital expenditure and total operating expenses, and total operating expenses and total labor expenses have complementary effects on southeastern U.S. cow-calf farm production. Total capital and total labor expenses are, however, substitutes.  The productivity impacts or marginal productive contributions (MPCs) of inputs and outputs have correct signs, negative for inputs and positive for outputs, as shown in Table  4. All of the measures are significant except for total capital expenditure. We also find decreasing returns to scale for the southeastern cow-calf operations.

This study employed the 2008 ARMS cow-calf version crosssectional survey data for the analysis of the southeastern cow-calf operations. The results show that total operating expenses and total labor expenses were significant inputs for the cow-calf farmer operations. We also found complementary effects between inputs including: total capital expenditure and total operating expenses, and total operating expenses and total labor expenses on cow-calf production. There was a substitution effect between total capital expenditure and total labor expenses. The measures of marginal productive contributions had correct signs for inputs and outputs, and they were significant except for total capital expenditure. The results also show that there is a room to decrease input use to produce output at the production frontier level."}]
