[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Worldwide, urban areas are expanding and are among the most rapidly changing landscapes. Urban areas modify wildlife habitat by replacing native vegetation cover with structures, roads, and other impervious surfaces (Czech, Krausman, & Devers, 2000) among many other effects (Pickett, Cadenasso, Grove, Boone, Groffman, et al., 2011). Bird species density (the number of species/area) in cities is reduced relative to surrounding regions, and appears to be highly sensitive to changes in land cover (Aronson, La Sorte, Nilon, Katti, Goddard, et al., 2014). However, most urbanization studies use a space-for-time substitution approach to document effects of urbanization through time (Pickett et al., 2011). Understanding effects of urbanization on biodiversity requires long-term datasets, which document temporal changes in species composition and species gains or losses (Magurran, Baillie, Buckland, Dick, Elston, et al., 2010;Strohbach, Hrycyna, & Warren, 2014). Although cities are designed primarily for the benefit of humans, many species of wildlife persist and thrive in urban environments (Aronson et al., 2014;Marzluff, 2001;McKinney, 2002;Pickett et al., 2011). Many large cities occur along waterways, and can alter stream hydrology and watershed infiltration because of impervious surfaces (Paul & Meyer, 2001). However, a more basic challenge in arid ecosystems is to provide sufficient water to maintain riparian ecosystems. In arid cities, perennial water from novel urban sources, such as storm drains, can support riparian areas with diverse plant and bird communities (Bateman, Stromberg, Banville, Makings, Scott, et al., 2015). Compared to other ecosystems, riparian areas support some of the highest bird diversities (Knopf & Samson, 1994), but can also be habitats that are highly sensitive to modification (Naiman, Decamps, & Pollock, 1993). Therefore, there is a growing need to identify sustainable mechanisms to restore and maintain urban riparian ecosystems and the services, such as habitat, they provide (Bernhardt & Palmer, 2007). During the last century, the greater Phoenix metropolitan area in central Arizona has had one of the fastest growing populations in the United States (Hobbs & Stoops, 2002). In this region, a system of channels and canals transport water from reservoirs on the Verde, Salt, and Colorado Rivers (Gober, Wentz, Lant, Tschudi, & Kirkwood, 2011) to support a large urban population of 4 million in Maricopa County (U.S. Census Bureau, 2015). Employing datasets available from the Central Arizona-Phoenix Long-Term Ecological Research program (https://caplter.asu.edu), we examined the effects of urbanization on riparian habitats and bird communities in Phoenix and the surrounding Sonoran Desert region. The aims of our study were to: (1) explore variation in bird species richness, abundance, and community composition as a function of water permanence and degree of human-modification; (2) identify which environmental variables measured at different scales (site-and landscape-level) best describe differences in habitat characteristics found across riparian site types; and (3) examine the temporal patterns of avian abundance, species richness, and diversity across riparian site types."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study area", "text": "Our research was conducted within the study area of the Central Arizona-Phoenix Long-Term Ecological Research program (hereafter CAP LTER), which encompasses the greater Phoenix metropolitan area and surrounding Sonoran Desert (hereafter Phoenix; Fig. 1). CAP LTER established two to four study sites in each of four riparian habitat types: (1) ephemeralengineered (n=4); (2) ephemeral-natural (n=2); (3) perennial-engineered (n=3); and (4) perennial-natural (n=3). CAP LTER defined types as ephemeral versus perennial based on the permanence of water. Types were also classified as engineered or natural defined by the degree of human-modification, which is more of a continuum rather than a dichotomy. Specifically, the ephemeral-engineered sites included a 200-m square retention basin surrounded by neighborhoods, two unlined earthen flood control channels surrounded by neighborhoods and golf courses, and one artificial water catchment surrounded by desert. The ephemeral-natural sites were along intermittent rivers surrounded by desert and some low density residential areas. The perennial-engineered sites included a landscaped riparian preserve, a constructed wetland, and a water retention area along the Salt River. These sites were surrounded by urban or agricultural areas. The perennial-natural sites were located along perennial river reaches and were surrounded by desert. Sites ranged between 295 and 683 m in elevation. Following Bibby, Burgess, Hill, and Mustoe (2000), CAP LTER used point count surveys with a 40-m fixed-radius where a trained observer recorded all birds seen and heard. At each point, the observer remained quiet for five minutes, then recorded birds for 15 minutes."}, {"section_title": "Bird surveys", "text": "Observers identified species based on Sibley (2000), and classified species according to Pyle and DeSante (2013). Birds detected beyond the 40-m truncation distance or that flew over the point were not counted, except for wide-ranging and foraging species (i.e. waterfowl, shorebirds, birds of prey, nighthawks, Greater Roadrunner, Geococcyx californianus; Belted Kingfisher, Megaceryle alcyon; and Loggerhead Shrike, Lanius ludovicianus). Surveys were conducted under similar environmental conditions and were completed within four hours of sunrise. From 2001 to 2013 (surveys were not conducted in 2003), three observers visited each point twice annually, once during winter (end of December to mid-February) and once during spring (end of March to mid-May)."}, {"section_title": "Vegetation and environmental variables", "text": "We collected eight site-level (within a 40-m radius around the point) and four landscapelevel (within a 1-km radius around the point) environmental variables during spring 2013. Sitelevel variables included percent cover for marsh, water, impervious surface (i.e., pavement, structures, etc.), and bare ground. We used slightly modified Daubenmire (1959) cover classes (i.e., cover classes: none, 0-1%, 1-5%, 5-25%, 25-50%, 50-75%, 75-95%, >95%) to estimate percent cover for each category within a 40-m radius. We quantified vegetation at the site-level by selecting 10 random points stratified to represent all vegetation types present (i.e., riparian, Sonoran Desert, marsh, etc.). Points were at least 10 meters apart and none of the points were located in open water bodies or on roads. We recorded the proportion of random points where vegetation was present at three height classes (low, below 0.6 m; medium, 0.6-1.5 m; and high, above 1.5 m). We recorded percent canopy cover in four cardinal directions using a concave densiometer, averaged the four readings per point, then averaged over the 10 points. At the landscape level, we used ArcGIS 10.2 to quantify four land cover categories (i.e., impervious surface, bare ground, water, and vegetation) around each sampling site (1-km radius). Land cover categories were included in a land-cover classification dataset provided by CAP LTER, which was generated from 2010 National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) imagery using methods detailed by Li, Myint, Zhang, Galletti, Zhang, et al. (2014)."}, {"section_title": "Data analyses", "text": "To compare bird abundance and species richness across riparian habitat types through time, we used Bayesian modeling since we had an unbalanced design. We generated two Bayesian models (one for abundance and one for species richness) with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) using package rjags (Plummer, 2014) for program R stats version 3.2.1 (R Core Team, 2013). The models followed a Poisson distribution (since data are univariate discrete numbers) with a log link function. As input, we used data from all three observers for each year and season. We used time as a covariate, and included a random effect for sites. We also included a novice observer effect to our models, since observers tend to have lower than expected count in the first year of conducting bird surveys (Kendall, Peterjohn, & Sauer, 1996). To compare how riparian type and season differ, we allowed parameters to vary by riparian type and season. We assigned non-informative priors with a normal distribution to parameters and novice observer effect. Since we had a small number of sites, for the site random effect, we assigned a zero-centered distribution to the hierarchical prior and used a folded-Cauchy distribution prior for its hyperparameter (precision). To be able to interpret intercepts and random effect, we employed a post-sweeping method to compute identifiable intercepts and random effect. For both models, we generated three independent MCMC chains and used Gelman-Rubin diagnostic to evaluate chains convergence. To generate the posterior distribution, we discarded the first 5,000 iterations to allow chains to converge, thinned by 25 to remove autocorrelation, and generated 1,000 sampled values per chain. To test model fit, we plotted replicated data against observed data. To elucidate patterns in bird community structure, we used unconstrained ordinations, specifically non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS; Clarke, 1993) with Bray-Curtis distance, with square root and Wisconsin transformations, using program R stats version 3.1.1 with the Vegan package (Oksanen, Blanchet, Kindt, Legendre, Minchin, et al., 2013). We defined seasonal annual bird abundance per site as the maximum number of each species recorded among three visits. We excluded species with less than five total individuals observed during the 12 years, excluded species occurring only at one site, and removed unidentified observations. Some bird species with low occurrences, that otherwise would be excluded, were combined into the following feeding guilds: accipiters, falcons, fish eating raptors, terrestrial raptors, cormorants, nighthawks, sandpipers, yellowlegs, and dowitchers. We computed dispersion ellipses (based on standard deviation of weighted averages) to show separation of riparian types in species space. To identify differences in bird assemblages across riparian types, we generated ellipses for each type. To assess overall temporal change in community structure and allow smoothing of short-term fluctuations, we combined all sites into 3-year moving averages and generated ellipses around each temporal period (i.e., period 1 is the 3-year average for years 2001,2002,2004; period 10 is the 3-year average for years 2011-2013). To assess temporal change in bird diversity per riparian type, we computed diversity profiles (R\u00e9nyi's index family; T\u00f3thm\u00e9r\u00e9sz, 1995) using program R stats version 3.1.1 with Vegan package (Oksanen et al., 2013). We compared profiles for early (2001,2002,2004) and recent time frames (2011-2013). To determine which environmental variables described habitat differences across riparian types, we used a permutation procedure to fit environmental variables onto spring bird ordination of recent years (2011-2013). Because site-level variables were collected in spring 2013, and landscape-level variables were based on remote-sensed images from 2010, we used only bird data from spring of 2011, 2012, and 2013 as input to generate the NMDS. Significant values of environmental vectors revealed which variables characterized each riparian type."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Bird abundance, richness, seasonality, and community composition", "text": "Bird community parameters varied seasonally and across riparian types. At perennial site types, we found greater abundances in winter than in spring (Table 1; Fig. 2). Within each season, bird abundance and species richness were higher at perennial sites compared to ephemeral sites (Table 1; Fig. 2; Appendix A). Bird abundance was highest at perennialengineered sites during both seasons. We also observed seasonal differences in riparian bird assemblages, with spring and winter bird communities composed of different migratory species (Appendix B, top panel). We "}, {"section_title": "Temporal shifts in bird community", "text": "We observed declining trends in abundance (Table 1) and species richness (Appendix A) during both spring and winter. Of the species with the most declines in abundance over time, 70% were passerine or songbirds (Appendix C). Most species in decline were present during both winter and spring surveys. Declining trends in bird abundance and species richness occurred across all riparian types, with one exception: the perennial-engineered sites during spring had a slight increase in bird abundance across time ( Table 1). The greatest declines (over 50%) in abundance and richness over the 12 year period occurred in natural sites. For both seasons, abundance and species richness decreased annually at a greater rate in natural sites (6% to 7% declines) compared to engineered sites (1% to 3.5% declines). During spring, abundance at ephemeral sites decreased annually (around 6% decline) at a greater rate than perennial sites (2.5% decline); whereas, ephemeral and perennial sites decreased similarly during winter (4% to 5% declines). During both seasons, species richness at ephemeral sites decreased at similar annual rates (over 5% declines) compared to perennial sites (over 4% declines). We observed temporal shifts in the composition of the riparian bird community for both seasons (Fig. 3). We interpreted a 3-dimensional solution for spring (NMDS stress = 13%, linear fit R\u00b2 = 88.4) and 3-dimensional solution for winter (NMDS stress = 12.9%, linear fit R\u00b2 = 88.3). As depicted by the trajectory of ellipses (representing the core of the bird community per temporal period), ordinations showed that riparian bird communities shifted toward assemblages found at ephemeral-engineered sites during both seasons. Diversity profiles (Appendix D) indicated the riparian bird community has become less diverse through time across riparian types and seasons. We were unable to compare diversity profiles of early and recent time frames at perennial-natural sites in winter because their profiles did not rank consistently (illustrated by intersecting lines), thus not allowing comparisons."}, {"section_title": "Habitat characteristics of riparian types", "text": "We tested the fit of 12 environmental variables (Appendix E) onto the ordination for spring birds during recent years (3-axis solution, NMDS stress = 14.2%, linear fit R\u00b2 = 85.2). We identified four site-level and four landscape-level variables that described differences in habitat characteristics among riparian types ( Fig. 4). At the landscape-level, sites with perennial flows had more vegetation and water cover compared to ephemeral sites. Ephemeral-engineered sites had the greatest amount of impervious surface; whereas, ephemeral-natural sites had the greatest amount of bare ground. At the site-level, perennial types had more water, canopy cover, and marsh compared to ephemeral sites. Among the perennial types, natural sites had a greater proportion of tall vegetation and dense canopy cover compared to engineered sites."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Our study provides one of the very few assessments of decadal changes in urban bird communities (for global bird declines observed via long-term data see : Julliard, Jiguet, & Couvet, 2004;Clavel, Julliard, & Devictor, 2011). In riparian zones of the greater Phoenix metropolitan area and surrounding Sonoran Desert region, we documented declines in both abundance and species richness, with declines exceeding 50% at natural sites over a 12-year monitoring period (Table 1). Bird communities in Phoenix riparian sites have shifted toward assemblages dominated by fewer, more abundant and more typical 'urban' species ( Fig. 3). However, even common, broadly distributed species also showed declines. Some of the species we observed are declining regionally or nationally. Thus, potential explanations for these shifts may include region-wide processes like drought or climate change. Alternatively, local land cover changes, like urban expansion and urban intensification may contribute to species losses via a variety of mechanisms including habitat loss and habitat degradation. We examine evidence for each of these explanations and discuss implications for safeguarding or enhancing riparian species diversity in cities."}, {"section_title": "Declines in bird community parameters during the last decade", "text": "One of the strengths of our study is the use of temporal rather than solely spatial comparisons. Although, we can compare which riparian types had the greatest abundance and richness, only temporal analyses allowed us to document that bird species richness dwindled by more than 2-8% per year. The benefit of a long-term study is to document individual fluctuations and trends of species in a community (Picket et al., 2011). Riparian bird diversity in Phoenix has declined due to decreases in both evenness and species richness. This decline suggests that the bird community has shifted toward an assemblage dominated by fewer more abundant species, a shift commonly found in other studies along spatial urbanization gradients (Melles, Glenn, & Martin, 2003;Shochat, Lerman, Anderies, Warren, Faeth, et al., 2010). This decrease in both richness and evenness suggests that migratory birds and specialists, which were common at the beginning of the study, have decreased in abundance and some species have been lost or replaced by more abundant species. Our results show that bird abundance has decreased for many different kinds of species. Ballard, Geupel, Nur, and Gardali (2003) had similar findings in their 20-year mist-netting study in central coastal California, with 16 of 31 species undergoing significant declines and no species increasing in abundance. We document declining trends in both migratory and resident species, and in typical urban 'avoiders' and urban 'invaders' (i.e., species that typically respond differently to urbanization, Marzluff & Rodewald, 2008). Both urban avoiders that migrate (e.g., Brewer's Sparrow, Spizella breweri; Northern Cardinal, and Yellow Warbler) and urban avoiders that are resident (e.g., Black-Tailed Gnatcatcher, Polioptila melanura; and Black-Throated Sparrow) experience declining trends. The latter species are consistent with recently observed patterns of decline among desert and aridland species across North America (Sauer, Link, Fallon, Pardieck, & Ziolkowski, 2013). It is more surprising, however, that we find declines in many common resident, typical urban-dwelling species in our study (e.g., House Finch, Haemorhous mexicanus, Mourning Dove, and House Sparrow). Mourning Doves are the most abundant species in our study and are widespread across the United States (Sauer et al., 2013). Data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey indicate slight declines in Mourning Doves of 0.4% per year (Sauer et al., 2013), suggesting that our findings are only partly reflective of broader scale trends for that species. In our study, only Canada Geese (Branta canadensis) increased over time, which mirrors the national trend for increases in urban geese populations (Smith, Craven, & Curtis, 1999). We suggest that future research address whether these patterns indeed represent regional trends or patterns inherent to urban ecosystems."}, {"section_title": "Drying conditions affect riparian habitats and birds", "text": "Similar to global human burdens on freshwater, Arizona and the southwest USA are projected to increase water demand and water supplies are projected to decrease due to climate change (Hawkins & Ellis, 2010). Arid regions throughout the world are projected to become warmer and drier, leading to higher frequency and intensity of drought (IPCC, 2007). Bird diversity is often associated with perennial flows in arid riparian systems (Merritt & Bateman, 2012). Therefore, groundwater losses that negatively influence the distribution and quality of riparian forests will also negatively affect resident and migratory bird habitat (Brand, Stromberg, Goodrich, Dixon, Lansey, et al., 2011). Wetlands in the arid southwest USA have experienced dramatic declines in extent (Weisberg, Mortenson, & Dilts, 2013). Within urban areas, discharge from municipal outflows (e.g., storm drains) along arid streams can provide hydrological conditions necessary for sustaining threatened wetland and riparian habitats (Bateman et al., 2015). A two year study along the Salt River in Phoenix found that areas which maintain riparian and wetland habitats from both passive and active restoration have abundant and diverse biotic communities, irrespective of the source of water (Bateman et al., 2015). Taken together, these studies document the relative importance of water quantity for habitat and bird diversity. In this study, Phoenix riparian sites with perennial flows are more similar in bird community composition and support the greatest abundance of birds compared to sites with ephemeral water. At the site-level, both perennial riparian types are associated with high levels of water and wetland cover. As such, perennial sites harbor more aquatic and shorelineassociated species compared to ephemeral sites. These birds may be attracted to resources like food, water, and cover that may be lacking at drier sites. Habitat structure also varied between the perennial riparian types, possibly accounting for why migratory songbirds were more common in perennial-natural sites compared to perennial-engineered sites. Our data and other studies from this arid region suggest that natural areas with tall vegetation and dense canopy cover support songbird habitat, similar to reaches along the Salt River (Bateman et al., 2015) and non-urban streams in central Arizona (Brand et al., 2011;Merritt & Bateman, 2012). Although high bird abundances at perennial sites suggest that areas with aquatic habitats are important for maintaining urban biota, we did observe an important shift in bird community composition over time. Interestingly, the composition of bird communities across all sites has become more similar to the composition found at ephemeral-engineered sites. This could suggest that even the perennial sites are experiencing habitat loss, which could contribute to the overall reduction in abundance of riparian birds, as well as, the change in community assemblage over time. In this study, we found the greatest decreases in birds at ephemeral compared to perennial sites. Even though we found more birds and more species at perennial sites, the importance of ephemeral riparian areas is not to be overlooked in aridland ecosystems (Katz, Denslow, and Stromberg, 2012). For example, non-perennial streams may represent vegetation and habitat available to both Sonoran Desert species and riparian obligate species. Future research should investigate if the mechanisms for bird declines varies among riparian types."}, {"section_title": "Land cover and habitat change", "text": "Although we do not have direct measures of land cover change around our sites, Phoenix has experienced both rapid urban expansion (Kane, Connors, & Galletti, 2014) as well as urban intensification over the past several decades (Stefanov, Netzband, M\u00f6ller, Redman, & Mack, 2007). In Phoenix and other metropolitan areas, urban areas are increasingly moving from a patchwork of agriculture and rural/residential yards to become more 'filled in' by impervious surfaces with low vegetation cover (Stefanov et al., 2007;Tratalos, Fuller, Warren, Davies, & Gaston, 2007). While for some species, the decline we observe may be part of regional trends, declines in common, resident urban-dwelling species leads us to suspect that urbanization has played a significant role. This view is bolstered by the clear shift in community composition that we observe across riparian types toward the more urban-dwelling species found in ephemeralengineered sites. This suggests that urbanization in areas surrounding riparian sites is contributing to declines in abundance and species richness as well as shifts in species composition. Similarly, other studies have quantified shifts in bird communities related to the modification of land cover. For example, a study in Great Britain found that urban intensification or 'densification' is associated with declines in bird densities (Tratalos, Fuller, Evans, Davies, Newson, et al., 2007). Another study in Massachusetts documenting bird community shifts over 150 years, found shifts toward more typical urban dwelling species and away from forest specialist species during a period in which wooded urban areas became progressively more densely populated (Strohbach et al., 2014). In our study, riparian types with ephemeral water have features that describe the openness of the habitat and support bird species associated with the Sonoran Desert (e.g., Gambel's Quail, and Curve-billed Thrasher). However, the openness found in engineered sites is comprised of impervious surfaces; whereas, natural sites have bare ground. Desert specialist species, such as Phainopepla (Phainopepla nitens), are present only at ephemeral-natural sites, highlighting the importance of preserving natural open spaces. A study in Berkeley, California, USA, suggested that green spaces serve to mitigate for loss of biodiversity by supporting specialist species in urban areas (Shultz, Tingley, & Bowie, 2012). Perhaps natural sites in Phoenix may serve as refugia for specialist species intolerant of a landscape dedicated to the built environment. We suggest additional research evaluate species-habitat relations and document modification to vegetation cover and open space over time."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Our results indicate that, over the last decade, several species have been lost, and many common and rare birds are experiencing declining abundances in riparian zones of the greater Phoenix metropolitan area and nearby surrounding Sonoran Desert. These declines tend to be greater in more natural sites compared to human-influenced, engineered sites. Bird communities respond to degree of water permanence in this arid city. Perennial sites are important because they provide habitat for a range of species, including aquatic and marshland birds, as well as, migratory songbirds. Engineered riparian sites in Phoenix appear to be surrounded by greater impervious surface cover and are associated with more typical urban-dwelling species. By contrast, natural sites support more specialists such as migratory songbirds and Sonoran Desert species. However, the decadal declines we found for species using these natural sites suggest that they may be sensitive to increased urban expansion or intensification in the areas surrounding natural riparian sites. Taken together, our study and others of riparian sites in Phoenix, suggest the following measures to maintain diverse and abundant riparian bird communities in the city: (1) preserving natural areas with high amounts of tall vegetation and dense canopy cover (for migratory songbirds), (2) retaining natural areas with bare ground (for upland Sonoran Desert species), and (3) maintaining or restoring habitats with perennial flows to support a diverse urban bird assemblage.
