[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Land-use changes can affect the environment and the sustainability of production. Because impacts on the environment-including erosion, water quality, and wildlife habitat-are typically not reflected in private profit calculations, land-use choices that are optimal for an individual may not be optimal for society. This difference suggests the possibility of public policies that more closely align land-use decisions with social objectives. The allocation of a fixed land base among competing uses is determined by the relative returns to the different uses, which vary according to land quality and location. A landowner seeking to maximize profits will allocate a land parcel to the use that yields the highest expected economic return, after the costs of conversion. As relative returns change along with market conditions, technological advancements, or government policies, land-use patterns tend to adjust accordingly (see the \"Land Use, Value and Management\" Briefing Room on the ERS website). Land-use change is dynamic. With the exception of urban land, changes occur to and from major land uses. For example, 44 million acres left the cropland and pasture category from 1992 to 1997 while 21 million acres shifted into the category, resulting in a net loss of 23 million acres (USDA/NRCS, 2000).\nThe United States, as a whole, has abundant freshwater supplies. Annual renewable supplies in surface streams and aquifers total roughly 1,500 million acre-feet per year (maf/yr). (See the \"Irrigation and Water Use\" Briefing Room on the ERS website) for definitions. Of total renewable supplies, only onequarter is withdrawn for use in homes, farms, and industry, and just 7 percent is actually used, i.e., lost to the immediate water environment (Moody, 1993). Roughly 90 percent of total water use nationwide comes from renewable surface-and ground-water supplies. The remainder comes from depletion of stored ground water (Foxworthy and Moody, 1986). An abundance of water in the aggregate belies increasingly limited water supplies in many areas, reflecting the uneven distribution of the Nation's water resources. In the arid West, more than half of the renewable water supplies are consumed under normal precipitation conditions. In drought years, water use often exceeds renewable flow through the increased use of water stored in aquifers and reservoirs. While droughts exacerbate supply scarcity, water demands continue to expand with resulting reallocations among uses. Urban growth, for example, has greatly expanded municipal water demands in arid areas of the Southwest and far West. At the same time, demand for instream (nonconsumptive) water flows for recreation, riparian habitat, and other environmental purposes has heightened competition for available water supplies in all but the wettest years. While future water needs for instream uses are difficult to quantify, the potential demands on existing water supplies are large and geographically diverse. Historically, increased water demands were met by expanding available water supplies. Dam construction, groundwater pumping, and interbasin conveyance provided the water to meet growing urban and agricultural needs. However, future opportunities for large-scale expansion of seasonally reliable water supplies are limited due to lack of suitable project sites, limited funding, and increased public concern for environmental consequences. Future water demands will increasingly be met through realloca-tion of existing supplies. Since agriculture is the largest freshwater user, reallocation will likely reduce supplies for agriculture (National Research Council, 1996). Changes in agricultural water availability may have significant impacts on irrigation-dependent crops in some locations, with implications for local agricultural industries and rural communities.\nThe production practices and inputs used by agriculture can result in a number of pollutants entering water resources, including sediment, nutrients, pathogens, pesticides, and salts. Farmers, when making production decisions, often do not consider offsite impacts associated with runoff or leaching. Documenting the links between agriculture and water quality can help policymakers provide appropriate incentives to farmers for controlling pollution that originates on farms. Agriculture is widely believed to have significant impacts on water quality. While no comprehensive national study of agriculture and water quality has been conducted, the magnitude of the impacts can be inferred from several water quality assessments. A general assessment of water quality is provided by EPA's 2000 Water Quality Inventory. Based on State assessments of 19 percent of river and stream miles, 43 percent of lake acres, and 36 percent of estuarine square miles, EPA concluded that agriculture is the leading source of pollution in 48 percent of river miles, 41 percent of lake acres (excluding the Great Lakes), and 18 percent of estuarine waters found to be water-quality impaired, in that they do not support designated uses. This makes agriculture the leading source of impairment in the Nation's rivers and lakes, and a major source of impairment in estuaries. Agriculture's contribution has remained relatively unchanged over the past decade. The significance of water pollutants commonly produced by agriculture is suggested by information on impaired waters provided by States, tribes, and territories to EPA in accordance with Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act. These are waters that do not meet water quality standards, and cannot meet those standards through point-source controls alone. The most recent information (2005) indicates that 25,823 bodies of water (stream reaches or lakes) are impaired nationwide. Pathogens, sediment, and nutrients are among the top sources of impairment, and agriculture is a major source of these pollutants in many areas. A U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) study of agricultural land in watersheds with poor water quality estimated that 71 percent of U.S. cropland (nearly 300 million acres) is located in watersheds where the concentration of at least one of four common surface-water contaminants (nitrate, phosphorus, fecal coliform bacteria, and suspended sediment) exceeded generally accepted instream criteria for supporting water-based recreation activities (Smith, Schwarz, and Alexander, 1994). Another USGS study found that structural changes in animal agriculture between 1982 and 1997 put upward pressure on stream concentrations of fecal coliform bacteria in many areas of the Great Plains, Ozarks, and Carolinas (Smith et al., 2005).\nWetlands today cover over 7 percent of the nonfederal land area of the 48 States. Most wetlands occur on forest land, while 15 percent-about 16.6 million acres-occur on lands associated with crop production and pasture. Despite having a relatively small portion of total wetland acres, agriculture has played and is likely to continue to play a significant role in wetland policy (USDA, NRCS, 2004). For example, much of the past losses in wetlands are attributable to agriculture. Between 1954 and 2002, 66 percent of total wetland losses (24.2 million acres) were from converting to agricultural uses. Furthermore, future gains in wetlands will likely draw from agricultural lands. Between 1974 and 2002, over 50 percent of all lands converted to wetlands had been in agricultural use. With the continuation of private and public initiatives to restore wetlands, agricultural lands are likely to continue to be converted to wetlands because the conversion of agricultural lands is often less costly than conversion from other uses (like urban ones) (Heimlich et al., 1998). Wetlands are a productive medium for forests, provide habitat for fish and wildlife, preserve water quality (see Chapter 2.2, \"Water Quality: Impacts of Agriculture\"), reduce flood damage, provide open spaces and recreational sites, and enhance wildlife diversity (table 2.3.1). For these reasons, society values wetlands. However, since most wetland benefits occur offsite, private owners usually cannot benefit economically from wetlands. Society's awareness of the value of wetlands has grown only in the last several decades. Wetlands were once seen as \"wasted\" land that should be exploited. When colonists first set foot in America, there were 221-224 million acres of wetlands in what was to become the contiguous United States (there were another 170 million acres in Alaska and Hawaii, not discussed further here). Most of those wetlands were in three regions: the Midwestern States (27 percent), the Southeastern States (24 percent), and the Delta and Gulf States (24 percent). As settlement spread, wetlands were converted for other uses, with the pace increasing as available nonwetlands diminished and drainage technology improved (Heimlich et al., 1998).\nUnprecedented growth in agricultural productivity over the past century can be attributed largely to investments in agricultural research and technology development (see Chapter 3.4, \"Productivity and Output Growth in U.S. Agriculture\"). Many developments-including more efficient agricultural machinery, agricultural chemicals and fertilizers, genetic improvements in crops, and changes in farm management techniques-have transformed U.S. agriculture. These developments have contributed to an abundant and affordable food supply for consumers. Most early research efforts sought to replace increasingly expensive resources with less expensive ones. For example, the development of farm machinery helped offset increasing labor costs. Currently, demands for safer, healthier, and more convenient foods, natural resource conservation, environmental protection, and animal welfare are changing the agricultural research portfolio. These demands relate directly to agricultural products and to the impacts of production methods.\nThe unprecedented growth in crop yields and agricultural productivity over the 20th century owes much to a series of biological innovations embodied in seeds, beginning with the development of hybrid crops in the United States in the early part of the century and continuing with high-yielding varieties during the Green Revolution of the 1960s and 1970s. More recently, developments in modern biotechnology are expanding the processes of biological innovations by providing new tools. Agricultural biotechnology is a collection of scientific techniques, including genetic engineering, that are used to create, improve, or modify plants, animals, and microorganisms. Genetic engineering (GE) techniques allow a more precise and time-saving alteration of a plant's traits (facilitating the development of characteristics not possible through traditional plant breeding), and permit targeting of a single plant trait (decreasing the number of unintended characteristics that may occur with traditional breeding). Despite the benefits, however, environmental and consumer concerns currently limit acceptance of agricultural biotechnology, particularly in Europe. The ultimate contributions of agricultural biotechnology will depend on our ability to recognize its potential benefits and its risks (Fernandez-Cornejo at al., 1999). Despite a focus here on genetically engineered crops in agriculture, the future importance of genetically engineered animals should not be understated. As a National Research Council (NRC) report indicates, the increased demand for meat and deterioration and loss of agricultural land will lead to pressures to exploit biotechnology to improve productivity in animal agriculture. GE crops are often classified into one of three generations (Panos, 1998). First-generation crops have enhanced input traits, such as herbicide tolerance, insect resistance, and resistance to environmental stresses like drought. Second-generation crops have added-value output traits, such as nutrientenhanced seeds for feed. Third-generation crops produce pharmaceuticals, bio-based fuels, and products beyond traditional food and fiber ( \nIncreased resource use and improvements in technology and efficiency have increased global food production more rapidly than population in recent decades, but 800 million people remain food insecure ( fig. 3.5.1). Meanwhile, growth in global agricultural productivity appears to be slowing, and land degradation has been blamed as a contributing factor. The interactions between biophysical processes and economic choices are complex, and data necessary to measure these processes are scarce, so estimates of land degradation's impact on productivity vary widely-as high as 8 percent per year due to soil erosion alone in the United States and as low as 0.1 percent per year due to all forms of soil degradation on a global scale. These differences make it difficult to assess potential impacts on food security or the environment, and thus the appropriate nature and magnitude of policy response. \nThis chapter examines the management structure of farms to ascertain who controls the use of farm assets, including land and water. Management units that make decisions for farms are described, extending information about how farmers control and guide their businesses. The chapter also examines decisions of farmers from the perspective of how production, marketing, finance, and human resources are used to form farm businesses.\nCrop production and its environmental effects depend on the quality of soil. Soil provides the physical, chemical, and biological processes required to sustain most terrestrial plant and animal life. Soil regulates water flow from rainfall, snowmelt, and irrigation between infiltration, root-zone storage, deep percolation, and runoff (National Research Council, 1993). Soil acts as a buffer between production activities and the environment by facilitating the cycling and decomposition of organic wastes and nutrients (carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and others), as well as the degradation of nitrates, pesticides, and other toxic substances that are potential pollutants in water or air (Kemper et al., 1997). Soil quality determines how well soil performs its functions. Soil has both inherent and dynamic qualities. Inherent qualities are those factors, such as texture, that affect a soil's natural ability to function, but do not change easily. Dynamic qualities depend on how a soil is managed. Soils respond differently to management, depending on the inherent properties of the soil and the surrounding landscape. Traditional measures of soil quality include land capability and suitability, productivity, erodibility, and vulnerability to leach pesticides and nitrates (Karlen et al., 1997). A comprehensive soil quality measure would combine these physical attributes with broader societal concerns, such as potential surface-water pollution from field runoff, protecting long-term soil productivity, and the health of agricultural/rural ecosystems. Soil quality can be maintained or enhanced through the use of appropriate crop production technologies and related resource management systems that involve the composition, structure, and function of entire ecosystems. Beneficial farm-level soil management practices are designed to maintain the quality and long-term productivity of the soil and to mitigate environmental damage from crop production. These practices include crop rotations, crop \nCrop producers use pesticides and other practices to manage insects, diseases, and weeds and to prevent crop yield or quality losses. Factors that influence pest management decisions include the extent of pest problems, cost and effectiveness of available practices, regulations on what pesticides can be used and how, and the prices of commodities and inputs. The recent entry of Asian soybean rust into the United States could increase fungicide use.\nThe major plant nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium) are critical for maintaining crop yields but have also been associated with the impairment of numerous streams, lakes, and aquifers. For most U.S. crops and in most regions, commercial fertilizer is the major source of plant nutrients, although organic sources-such as legumes, crop residue, and animal wastes-can also provide nutrients required for plant growth. Commercial fertilizer is a major agricultural input; farmers typically spend over $10 billion annually on commercial fertilizer, although fertilizer use and prices vary from year to year. Historically, crop producers have used large amounts of commercial fertilizer and organic nutrients, but the concern over runoff and leaching has prompted the promotion of nutrient management practices that minimize nutrient loss. The share of acres receiving fertilizer, application rates for primary nutrients (nitrogen, phosphate, and potash), and nutrient management practices on major field crops (corn, soybeans, wheat, and cotton) remained fairly stable over the 1990s. However, fertilizer prices, especially for nitrogen, have been volatile and have risen rapidly in recent years. Despite increased fertilizer prices and growing concern about environmental risks from fertilizer use, the use of nutrient management practices on major crops has changed little since the early 1990s.\nAnimal production industries have seen substantial changes over the past several decades, the result of domestic/export market forces and technological changes. The number of large operations has increased, and animal and feed production are increasingly separated in terms of both management and geography. Concern that these changes are harming the environment has prompted local, State, and Federal policies (see Chapter 5.1, \"Federal Laws Protecting Environmental Quality\") and programs to control pollution from animal production facilities.\nInformation technology (IT) enables U.S. farmers to access real-time market information and buy and sell through e-commerce sites; manage their cropland at ever smaller scales (to meet both economic and environmental objectives) through precision agriculture; and use modern accounting, recordkeeping, and tax management through computer and Internet resources. 1 Telecommunication infrastructure in rural areas is crucial if farmers and rural residents are to adopt and utilize IT. Many government agencies, including those servicing farmers, are offering clients the ability to receive information and program benefits via the Internet.\nFarmers have been developing organic farming systems in the United States since the 1940s, and organic markets have emerged and expanded greatly since then. USDA implemented national standards for organic production and processing in October 2002, following more than a decade of development, and the new uniform standards have facilitated further growth in the organic farm sector. USDA's organic standards incorporate cultural, biological, and mechanical practices that foster cycling of resources, ecological balance, and protection of biodiversity-practices that have evolved over the last half-century. An increasing number of U.S. farmers are adopting these systems in order to lower input costs, conserve nonrenewable resources, capture high-value markets, and boost farm income. Despite the time, costs, and effort required to meet these stringent requirements, USDA estimates that farmers and ranchers added more than a million acres of certified organic land for major crops and pasture between 1995 and 2003, doubling organic pasture and more than doubling organic cropland for major crops. Total certified organic cropland and pasture now encompasses 2.2 million acres in 49 States. Organic livestock, which require access to organic pasture, have grown more numerous since USDA lifted restrictions on organic meat labeling in late 1999. Food crops and other animal foods (eggs and dairy) are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration and were allowed to carry an organic label throughout the 1990s. Consumer demand for organically produced goods has risen for over a decade, providing market incentives for U.S. farmers across a broad range of products. Organic products are now available in nearly 20,000 natural food stores and nearly 3 of 4 conventional grocery stores. Organic sales account for approximately 2 percent of total U.S. food sales, according to recent industry statistics. Farmers' markets and other direct-market venues have also grown in number over the last decade, and are especially popular among organic producers. Organic farmers are also finding ways to capture a larger segment of the consumer food dollar through onfarm processing, producer marketing cooperatives, and new forms of direct marketing, including agricultural subscription services.\nIn 2004, USDA's land retirement programs accounted for over half of all the Department's conservation expenditures (See Chapter 5.1 for an overview of conservation programs.). Under these programs, the Government offers rental payments and other incentives to farm owners and operators, who convert land from agricultural production to land covers deemed more environmentally beneficial. In 2004, USDA spent over $1.6 billion on the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) to retire over 34 million acres of cropland. In addition, the $280 million spent on the Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP) increased protected wetland acreage to over 1.6 million acres. Although the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 signaled a shift toward working lands programs, land retirement will continue to be important. In this chapter, we review the trends, status, and challenges facing both the CRP and the WRP.\nTo improve consistency between commodity and conservation programs, compliance provisions require farmers to meet some minimum standard of environmental protection on environmentally sensitive land as a condition of eligibility for many Federal farm program benefits-including farm commodity program payments. Under current compliance requirements, farm program eligibility could be denied to producers who: Fail to implement and maintain a Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS)-approved soil conservation system on highly erodible land (HEL) that is currently in crop production and was cropped before 1985-a provision known as conservation compliance; Convert HEL to crop production without applying an approved soil conservation system-referred to as sodbuster; or, Produce an agricultural commodity on a wetland converted after December 23, 1985, or convert a wetland after November 28, 1990, in a way that makes the production of an agricultural commodity possible-referred to as swampbuster. Producers who violate compliance requirements risk losing all Federal farm programs payments-not just those payments that were (or might have been) made on the HEL or wetland in question. Sodbuster and swampbuster provisions became effective on December 23, 1985, when the Food Security Act became law. Conservation compliance was implemented over a period of years. By 1990, producers growing crops on HEL were required to have an approved conservation plan. Plans were developed site by site to account for the broad diversity of resource conditions, cropping patterns, and producer preferences. By 1995, producers were required to be actively applying the conservation systems specified in their conservation plan. All three types of compliance have been continued in subsequent farm bills (1990, 1996, and 2002). Compliance was originally designed to prevent farm support and conservation programs from working at cross-purposes. In the 1970s, evidence suggested that farm commodity programs encouraged crop production on relatively erosive land, even as conservation programs attempted to mitigate erosion (Watts et al., 1983;Reichelderfer, 1985;Heimlich, 1986). Compliance eliminated the farm program incentive to expand production onto HEL. Compliance mechanisms can also leverage farm program payments for environmental gain-without additional payments-to the extent that producers adopt conservation practices to retain farm program eligibility. Compliance mechanisms are a unique policy tool, distinct from-and in some ways more effective than-conservation payment incentives (e.g., cost sharing). In particular, compliance may be more effective than payments in deterring environmentally harmful actions. For example, a hypothetical subsidy program designed to prevent wetland drainage would require policymakers to pay for protection of all wetlands on agricultural land-a potentially expensive proposition-or decide which wetlands are sufficiently vulnerable to agricultural conversion as to warrant protection-a potentially difficult task (Heimlich and Claassen, 1998b). In contrast, swampbuster penalties are assessed only when a violation occurs, eliminating the need for broad-based subsidies or the need to anticipate the potential for a violation to occur on any given wetland. No direct costs are imposed on producers who comply, although there may be an opportunity cost associated with production forgone on wetlands.\nThe many and varied resource concerns influenced by agricultural production are often the result of small contributions from many farms over vast areas, and \"one-size-fits-all\" solutions are unlikely to be effective in addressing them. Policymakers have a wide range of policy instruments to address resource concerns (see Chapter 5.1, \"Conservation Policy Overview\"). One tool, land retirement (see Chapter 5.2), is and will continue to be an important part of U.S. conservation policy, yet many resource concerns-such as nutrient and pesticide runoff (see AREI Chapters 2.2 and 4.5)-can be more cost-effectively addressed on the 850 million acres of working cropland and grazing land. Programs directed at working-land conservation are growing. Much of the 80-percent increase in conservation funding outlined by the Farm Security and Rural Investment (FSRI) Act of 2002 goes toward conservation efforts under two programs that pay farmers for conservation efforts on working lands-the Environmental Quality Incentives Program and the Conservation Security Program.\nUSDA has provided technical assistance for grazing systems since the 1930s. An expanded focus on preservation and stewardship of private grazing lands in recent years reflects a growing awareness of their importance to the Nation's environmental health and economic well-being. Achieving USDA conservation objectives for grassland and rangeland resources will involve public/private partnerships in support of sustainable grazing systems. Agricultural Resources and Environmental Indicators, 2006 Edition / EIB-16 Economic Research Service/USDA 1 An animal-unit, defined here as 1,000 pounds of live animal weight, serves as a common unit for aggregating over livestock types. \nExpansion of land in urban uses often encroaches on cropland, pasture, and rangeland. When these types of farmland are converted to urban uses, the ability of the land to produce agricultural outputs is lost. Such losses are the focus of growing public financial support for farmland protection. All 50 States have enacted one or more farmland protection programs to help slow the conversion of farmland to developed uses. If farmland only produced agricultural commodities, the normal workings of the land market would optimally allocate land between farming and urban uses. However, farmland also provides a number of other benefits, or rural amenities, including open space, scenic views, rural agrarian character, and wildlife habitat. These nonmarket benefits are not typically accounted for in the land market, as landowners are seldom able to extract payment from anyone for providing these amenities. Consequently, landowners may not take the social value of these amenities into account when considering whether to develop land for urban-related purposes.\nFarmers face a complex set of factors when they make decisions about farm management and conservation practices. The vagaries of weather and markets introduce uncertainty into farmers' operations. The use of conservation practices may also introduce uncertainty about net returns while producing benefits enjoyed mostly off the farm. Decisions made by farmers on how and where to produce commodities can be influenced by policies and programs for protecting the environment. USDA has several major programs for providing financial and technical assistance to farmers for protecting water quality, soil quality, and wildlife habitat (see AREI Chapters 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, and 5.6). Farmers can also be influenced by other Federal environmental protection policies and programs that may restrict certain production practices. This chapter will focus on these programs. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is chiefly responsible for administering these policies and programs. The Clean Water Act (1972) is the major law protecting water quality. Several CWA programs address \"nonpoint-source\" pollution, which is the most prevalent type of pollution associated with agriculture (see Chapter 2.2, \"Water Quality Impacts of Agriculture\"). The Nonpoint Source Program (Section 319) requires States to develop nonpoint-source management programs. Nonpoint-source control plans can include State regulatory measures, but usually emphasize voluntary actions like those used in USDA conservation programs. Implementation grants to States and tribes ($200 million in FY2005) fund projects like installation of best management practices (BMPs) for animal waste; design and implementation of BMP systems for stream, lake, and estuary watersheds; and basinwide landowner education programs. The Clean Water State Revolving Fund (CWSRF), created by Congress to fund the construction of water treatment plants, can be used by States to provide reduced-rate loans for water quality projects included in the State nonpoint-source plan. Fifteen States have used CWSRF for funding waste management systems, manure spreaders, conservation tillage equipment, irrigation equipment, filter strips, and streambank stabilization. Water pollution from some animal feeding operations is treated as a point source under the Clean Water Act (see Chapter 4.5, \"Animal Agriculture and the Environment\"). Confined animal feeding operations meeting certain size thresholds or other conditions fall under the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES, Section 402). These operations, known as Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs), must obtain NPDES permits that specify standards for the production area (i.e., housing, waste storage) and for the land where wastes are applied. CAFOs must also implement a nutrient management plan for animal manure applied to land, a significant change for Federal water quality laws. As a form of nonpoint pollution, nutrient runoff from fields has traditionally been addressed with voluntary approaches. This is the first time that a nonpoint source of water pollution has been regulated at the Federal level. EPA estimates that up to 15,500 operations are covered by the CAFO regulations. These regulations may impose significant manure management costs in areas where land for spreading manure is scarce. These costs could influence location decisions for large operations and spur the development of alternative uses for manure. EPA encourages CAFOs to seek financial and technical assistance from USDA to help them meet manure management requirements. The Total Maximum Daily Load provisions of the Clean Water Act are intended to be the second line of defense for protecting the quality of surface water resources. When technology-based controls are inadequate for water to meet State quality standards, Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act requires States to identify those waters and to develop total maximum daily loads (TMDL). A TMDL is the maximum amount of a pollutant that a water body can receive and still meet water quality standards, and an allocation of that amount to all the pollutant's sources. States must submit to EPA a list of impaired waters and the cause of the impairment. More than 20,000 such waters have been identified as impaired under Section 303(d) ( fig. 5.7.1). Among the top impairments are sediment, nutrients, and pathogens. States, territories, and authorized tribes are responsible for establishing a program to meet TMDLs. Point-source reductions to meet wasteload allocations are achieved through NPDES permits. Agricultural nonpoint sources are generally addressed through voluntary programs, but States may use regulations. TMDLs have not generally been used to regulate agricultural production, but particular management practices are required on agricultural operations in three TMDL-designated watersheds in California. Section 404 of the Clean Water Act establishes a program for protecting wetlands. It regulates the discharge of dredged and fill material into U.S. waters, including wetlands, and is a key policy for meeting the \"no net loss\" goal for wetland acreage. Section 404 contains a review process that handles small conversions through general permits. More thorough, qualitative reviews are conducted for major proposals affecting wetlands. Activities regulated under this program include fills for development, water resource projects (such as dams and levees), infrastructure development (such as highways and airports), and conversion of wetlands to uplands for farming and forestry. Under the law, a permit is required to fill a wetland, and is granted only if impacts to wetlands are minimized. Compensation for any unavoidable impacts is made through wetland restoration elsewhere. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers administers the program, while EPA develops and interprets environmental criteria used in evaluating permit applications. Ongoing farming activities are generally exempt from Section 404, but filling wetlands to create new farmland would require a permit.  efforts. Each assessment must include four elements: (1) delineating (or mapping) the source water assessment area, (2) conducting an inventory of potential sources of contamination in the delineated areas, (3) determining the susceptibility of the water supply to those contamination sources, and (4) releasing the results of the determinations to the public. Under the 1996 amendments, EPA is required to establish a list of contaminants for consideration in future regulation. The Drinking Water Contaminant Candidate List, released in March 1998, lists chemicals by priority for (a) regulatory determination, (b) research, and (c) monitoring. Several agricultural chemicals-including metolachlor, metribuzin, and the triazines-are among those to be considered for potential regulatory action. Also under the 1996 amendments, water suppliers are required to inform their customers about the levels of certain contaminants (and associated EPA standards), and the likely sources of the contaminants. The Clean Air Act (CAA) of 1970 sets limits on how much of a pollutant can be in the air anywhere in the United States. Under Section 110, each State must develop a State Implementation Plan (SIP) to identify the sources of air pollution and to determine what reductions are required to meet Federal air quality standards. A SIP is a collection of the regulations a State will use to clean up polluted areas. Pollutants regulated under the CAA are called criteria air pollutants. Permissible emission levels are generally based on health concerns, but visibility standards may also apply. The criteria pollutant most associated with agriculture is particulates. Where airborne dust from fields, burning crop residues, or other sources exceeds permissible levels, States must take steps to reduce emissions. Airborne dust from fields in Washington and particulates from burning rice straw in California have led to SIPs for controlling emissions from agricultural fields. Ammonia is a precursor for fine particulates in the atmosphere, and confined animal operations are the source for over 70 percent of ammonia emissions in the United States. California has implemented State regulations for reducing ammonia emissions from dairy operations that were affecting air quality in heavily populated areas downwind. EPA recently revised the particulate matter standard to control for fine particulates. This could result in States' requiring animal feeding operations to control ammonia emissions. The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) of 1947 provides direct controls over the sale and use of pesticides. Under FIFRA, all pesticides must be approved by EPA through a mandatory registration process. Products determined to pose an unacceptable risk to human health or to the environment can be denied registration, thereby preventing their distribution and use. Fifty pesticides and pesticide formulations have been banned under FIFRA as of 2004. In 1996, the Food Quality Protection Act amended FIFRA to eliminate inconsistencies between it and the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938 (which regulates pesticide residues on food). The amendments allow EPA to move quickly to suspend the use of a pesticide to prevent serious risks to human health and the environment. The amendments also provide incentives for the development and maintenance of minor use registrations. Minor uses of pesticides are defined as uses for which pesticide product sales do not justify the costs of developing and maintaining EPA registrations. Lack of registrations can limit the pest control tools available to the growers of \"minor\" crops (including many fruits and vegetables). The Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973 conserves the ecosystems upon which endangered and threatened species (wildlife and plants) depend. To do so, the law regulates the modification or degradation of habitat deemed critical for species survival. All Federal agencies are required to protect endangered species and protect their habitat. Private landowners who wish to conduct activities on their land that might incidentally harm wildlife listed as endangered or threatened are required to obtain an incidental take permit from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. To obtain a permit, the landowner must develop a Habitat Conservation Plan. The plan is designed to offset any harmful effects the proposed activity might have on the species. Under the Act, EPA must also ensure that the use of pesticides it registers will not result in harm to any species listed as endangered and threatened by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, or to habitat critical to those species' survival. EPA's Office of Pesticide Programs initiated the voluntary Endangered Species Protection Program in 1988 to protect endangered and threatened species from harm due to pesticide use. Labels of certain pesticides contain information to help users minimize the risk of pesticide use in critical habitat areas. At least 1 county in 24 States has pesticide use restrictions under this program ( fig. 5.7.3). The Endangered Species Act may have a large impact on agriculture through the supply of irrigation water from Federal irrigation projects. The Bureau of Reclamation has taken measures to protect the flow of rivers supporting endangered species, such as salmon. Sufficient flow for endangered species can reduce the irrigation water available to farmers from Federal irrigation projects, with obvious implications for crop production.

This series contains acreage estimates of major uses by region and State, coinciding with each census of agriculture from 1945 through 2002. (See the glossary for detailed definitions of the major land uses.) Because Alaska and Hawaii have very little crop area, we focus on the contiguous 48 States. The total land area of the 48 contiguous States is approximately 1.9 billion acres, with an additional 365 million acres in Alaska and a little over 4 million acres in Hawaii (table 1.1.1). land. Since 1945, the amount of cropland used for crops has ranged from as much as 383 million acres in 1949 and 1982 to a minimum of 331 million acres in 1987. Total acreage used for crops exhibited two major cycles between 1945 and 1987, with cropland moving from idle to crop use and back again. Cropland used for crops increased from 331 to 349 million acres over 1987-97, and then declined to 340 million acres in 2002, about 5 percent below the average acreage for 1910-97. Since 1945, cropland used for pasture varied from 47 million acres in 1945 to 88 million acres in 1969. Special uses include rural transportation; rural parks and wildlife; defense and industrial uses; and farmstead, farm roads/lanes, and other onfarm uses. These special uses increased from 85 million acres (4 percent of the land area of the contiguous 48 States) in 1945 to 153 million acres (8 percent) in 2002. Land in transportation uses (highways and roads, railroads, and airports in rural areas) increased by 4 million acres (17 percent) between 1945 and 1982. Transportation uses declined by about 0.5 million acres from 1982 to 1992 due to the abandonment of railroad facilities and rural roads, and the classification of some transportation uses as urban areas. Land used for recreation and wildlife areas (Federal and State parks, wilderness areas, and wildlife refuges) expanded 344 percent from 1945 to 2002 (an increase of 78 million acres). The increase came mostly from conversion of Federal lands, previously in forest and grassland pasture and range. Land in defense and industrial uses declined by 10 million acres (40 percent) from 1945 to 2002. Farmsteads, farm roads, and other farm uses declined by 4 million acres (29 percent) between 1945 and 1997. This decline reflects trends toward fewer farms and larger, more consolidated farms, as well as an increasing tendency for farm households to live off the farm. In response to expanding U.S. population, land in urban uses-including homes, schools, office buildings, shopping sites, and other commercial/industrial uses-increased from 15 million acres in 1945 to 25 million acres in 1960, 47 million acres in 1980, and 59 million acres in 2002. While the U.S. population nearly doubled, the amount of land urbanized quadrupled. However, urban uses still comprise only 3 percent of the total land area of the contiguous States. Miscellaneous other land uses decreased from 1945 to 1964, and have since trended upward, showing a 54-percent increase from 1964 to 2002 reflecting improved data and reclassification of grazing and forest lands. These uses include marshes and open swamps not included in other major land uses, bare rock areas, deserts, some rural residential areas, and other uses not inventoried. Wetlands are defined by soil and hydrological characteristics and may occur on land in many different uses (see Chapter 2.3, \"Wetland Status and Trends\")."}, {"section_title": "Regional Changes in Land Use", "text": "While land in every use occurs in all 10 regions of the contiguous States, some uses are more concentrated in some regions than in others ( fig.1.1.1). Regions with the largest cropland acreage are the Northern Plains, Corn Belt, and Southern Plains. Grassland pasture and range is concentrated in the Mountain and Southern Plains regions. Acreage in forest use, special and miscellaneous other uses is highest in the Mountain region. The Northeast, Appalachian, Southeast, Delta States, and Lake States regions lost cropland between 1945 and 2002. The largest increases occurred in the Northern Plains and Mountain regions, with smaller increases in the Corn Belt, Southern Plains, and Pacific regions. Western increases may have resulted in part from federally subsidized irrigation water (see Chapter 2.1, \"Irrigation Resources and Water Costs\"). Nine of the 10 regions lost grassland pasture and range between 1945 and 2002. While grassland pasture and range increased 11 million acres (10 percent) in the Southern Plains, the Northeast region lost about 70 percent of its grassland pasture and range, and the Appalachian and Lake States regions lost more than 50 percent. The Northeast and Appalachian regions saw the reforestation of grassland, loss of some grassland to urbanization, and concentration of the dairy industry. Decreases in the Corn Belt, Northern Plains, and Mountain regions were likely associated with the conversion of some grassland pasture and range to cropland."}, {"section_title": "Cropland Use and Federal Programs", "text": "While total cropland acreage has varied up and down and generally declined since 1969, greater shifts have occurred between cropland used for crops and cropland idled, mostly because of Federal programs. Cropland used for pasture has exhibited less variation in acreage than cropland idled. Most cropland used for crops is harvested, but typically 2-3 percent experiences crop failure and 5-10 percent is cultivated summer fallow (table 1.1.2). In 2002, farmers harvested one or more crops on an estimated 307 million acres of cropland, down 4 percent from 1997. About 8 million acres of the total harvested were double-cropped. When double-cropped land is counted twice, total acres harvested rise to 315 million acres. Cropland used for crops was at a record high of 387 million acres in 1949, when no acres were idled by Federal programs. In 1972, cropland used for crops was near a record low of 334 million acres as Federal programs idled 61 million acres. Cropland used for crops climbed to 387 million acres in 1981, when Federal programs idled no cropland, and dropped to 333 million in 1983, when Federal program set-asides reached a historic peak of 78 million acres under the Payment-in-Kind (PIK) program. The Federal Agricultural Improvement Act (FAIR) of 1996 eliminated all Federal acreage reduction programs other than the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) (see Chapter 5.2, \"Land Retirement Programs\"). Between 1983 and 2002, cropland used for crops increased overall, while total acreage idled by Federal programs decreased to 34 million acres. From 1997 to 2002, cropland used for crops declined from 349 to 340 million acres, while acreage idled under CRP increased by about 1 million acres. Between 2002 and 2004, acreage in CRP increased by an additional 1 million acres, while cropland used for crops declined by about 4 million acres (table 1.1.2). The 14-million-acre drop in harvested cropland between 1997 and 2002 was coincident with a decrease in cultivated summer fallow and an increase in failed acres due to widespread drought. Crop failure occurred on 17 million acres, over 5 percent of the acreage planted, in 2002. This failed acreage was the largest since 1956. The use of summer fallow has been decreasing since the late 1960s, and stood at 15 million acres in 2002, down from 42 million acres in 1969. Four crops-corn for grain, soybeans, wheat, and hay-accounted for 80 percent of all crop acres harvested in 2002 ( fig. 1.1.2). The additional 17 \"principal\" crops accounted for another 15 percent of harvested area. Vegetables, fruits, nuts, melons, and all other crops accounted for 4.5 percent of crop area harvested in 2002. as well as rural transportation land, totaled 107 million acres in 2002 in the contiguous United States. The NRI indicates that developed land increased by 14 million acres (19 percent) over 1982-92 and 21 million acres (24 percent) over 1992-2002(USDA/NRCS, 2004. Land converted to urban uses comes from several different major land uses. The NRI indicates that 20 percent of new developed land came from cropland between 1997 and 2002. Prime cropland-land that has the best combination of physical/chemical characteristics for agricultural production-is converted to developed uses at about the same rate (5 percent per year) as nonprime cropland (USDA/NRCS, 2003). About 21 percent of rural non-Federal land is prime and 26 percent of crop land converted to urban uses over 1997-2001 was prime. Rural land, defined as all land that is not urban, contains rural residential land, consisting of houses and associated lots. Nonfarm rural residential area was estimated to be about 94 million acres in 2002, up from 56 million acres in 1980. The average rate of increase in rural residential land was 1.7 million acres per year from 1980 to 2002. Combining both rural and urban residential land, the total increase in residential area was about 2 million acres per year during this period."}, {"section_title": "Farm Real Estate Values", "text": "Farmland values rose rapidly during the 1970s and early 1980s, followed by a sharp decline during 1982-87, then a slow upward trend beginning in 1987 ( fig. 1.2.1). Since 1987, average farmland values in the Nation have increased 127 percent, from $599 per acre to $1,360 in January 2004. In real or inflation-adjusted terms (GDP deflator), however, this amounts to a 53-percent gain. It was not until January 1, 1995, that the average nominal value per acre surpassed the record high of $823 set in 1982. But the January 2004 average is still 8 percent below the 1982 average on a real (or inflation-adjusted) basis. The 7.1-percent nominal increase in the national average value of agricultural real estate during 2004 marked the 17th consecutive increase since 1987. Over the previous 4 years, in particular, farm real estate values had increased substantially in all U.S. regions (table 1.2.1). Most notable is a 42-percent increase in the Lake States, versus 25 percent for all regions combined. The increases were widespread, with most States exhibiting increases for farm real estate, cropland, and pasture. As of January 2004, several Northeast States continued to record the highest average per-acre values for farm real estate, with Connecticut and Rhode Island exceeding $10,000 per acre (fig. 1.2.2). These values reflect continued pressure from nonagricultural sources for conversion to residential or other urban-related uses. The high values in States such as California, Florida, Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, and North Carolina are the consequence of urban pressures, the production of high-value crops, or high soil fertility. The low real estate values for many States in the Northern Plains, Southern Plains, and Mountain regions can be attributed to large amounts of arid rangeland and less productive cropland. New Mexico, Wyoming, and Montana recorded the lowest average values per acre."}, {"section_title": "Cash Rents", "text": "Nearly a third of U.S. farmland is operated under some form of lease, according to the 2002 Census of Agriculture. The most common form of lease, the cash rental agreement, is a fixed payment negotiated before planting. Share rental agreements, by contrast, vary with the amount of product harvested. Under cash rental arrangements, the tenant bears all of the production and market-price risk; share rental arrangements divide production and market risks between tenant and landlord. Cash rents are generally considered a short-term indicator of the return to a landowner's investment. To tenants, though, cash rents are a major production expense and, like farm real estate values, have been increasing for a number of years ( fig. 1.2.3). Because rents reflect the income-earning capacity of the land, they vary widely across the country. Cropland rents tend to be highest in areas where higher-value crops are grown. The highest average cash rents in 2004 were reported for irrigated land in California, at $300 per acre ( fig. 1.2.4). California produces large quantities of high-value specialty crops, vegetables, fruits, and nuts. Cropland most suitable for corn and soybean production, principally in the Midwest, also commands high rents. The highest rents for nonirrigated cropland in 2004 were reported as $126 per acre in both Illinois and Iowa ( fig. 1.2.4). During 2004, average cash rents for pasture varied from $37 per acre in Wisconsin to $1.70 per acre in New Mexico.

A grazing unit is defined on an animal-unit-month (AUM) basis, which is one cow or cow-calf pair, or seven sheep/goats, feeding for 1 month (NASS, 2005). Grazing fees on public lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) of the U.S. Department of the Interior, and the Forest Service (FS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) are set by law. These fees vary annually according to a legislated formula, which links the fees to changes in the cost of production. As a result of the formula, 2005 grazing fees on public land were set at $1.79 per AUM. That marks the second consecutive year in which grazing fees were set above the statutory minimum $1.35 per AUM. Grazing rates on privately owned nonirrigated land in 16 Western States averaged $14.30 per AUM in 2004. Rates ranged from $7 in Arizona and Oklahoma to $23 per AUM in Nebraska. Private grazing rates have trended upward since the early 1990s."}, {"section_title": "Factors Affecting Farm Real Estate Values", "text": "Traditionally, farmland value was based on its agricultural productivity. Particularly in the more rural areas of the Nation, where farmers still account for most farmland purchases, net returns to agricultural uses are the principal determinant of farmland value. Interest rates, capital investment in farm structures, and many other factors also influence productivity and thus the agricultural value of farm real estate. But today, many factors unrelated to productivity-including urban influence, government program payments, and rural amenities-contribute to the value of land in rural areas. In fact, these factors may be more important than productivity. High levels of direct government payments, which have occurred particularly since 1999, may have influenced farmland values in some regions."}, {"section_title": "Urban Influence", "text": "Farmland near cities has seen its value inflated by demand for conversion to nonfarm uses. As the U.S. population continues to grow and disperse, even primarily rural States such as Iowa are experiencing urban-related influences on farmland values. Commuters, who can now travel farther or even telecommute, are often willing to pay more than agricultural value in order to live in primarily rural areas. Other families develop hobby farms, second homes, or recreational structures in rural areas. In Iowa, for instance, there are now more nonfarmers living in rural areas than there are farmers (see Chapter 1.1, \"Land Use\"). Other nonagricultural factors that may contribute value include the potential to concurrently use farmland for fee-based hunting, fee-based recreation, or wildlife viewing. Nonfarm influences on agricultural real estate values have gained increased attention as interest in farmland preservation, suburban \"sprawl,\" and habitat conservation has grown. Recent research indicates that nonfarm influence accounts for 25 percent of the market value of U.S. farmland (Barnard, 2000). An ERS report recently addressed issues surrounding development of new houses, roads, and commercial buildings at the fringe of existing urban areas. This \"sprawl\" into the countryside can intersperse sometimes incompatible urban-related development with existing agriculture. Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) contain 20 percent of U.S. land area and 80 percent of U.S. population (Bureau of the Census, 2000). The area also contained more than a third of all U.S. farms in 2003 and produced about a third of agricultural production value."}, {"section_title": "Direct Federal Payments", "text": "An array of government policies influence the income derived from farmland, and hence its value. Federal commodity and conservation programs are the most obvious. But also important are farm credit programs, State and local zoning regulations, habitat and species protection laws, infrastructure development (such as roads and dams), environmental regulations, and even property and income tax policy. Previous research has shown that capitalization of expected payments increases cropland values (Barnard et al., 2001). Also, the degree to which direct Federal payments are capitalized into cropland values depends upon the issuing program (Goodwin and Mishra, 2003). If direct payments are capitalized into cropland values, as many theorize and some research has demonstrated, then a reduction in payments could signal a decline in cropland values and a loss of wealth for landowners. Further, ERS estimates that the degree to which direct payments (even from the same program) are capitalized into cropland values varies widely, with capitalization greatest in the Northern Plains. So from a policy perspective, the effect of program changes on cropland values would vary depending on the dominant program crop in a region."}, {"section_title": "Other Market-Related Factors", "text": "Interest rates, particularly inflation-adjusted ones, are especially important determinants of U.S. farmland values. As proxies for the discount rate, interest rates determine the current value of expected future earnings from land: for a given pattern of future earnings, higher (lower) interest rates imply lower (higher) land values. During much of the mid-to late 1970s, real interest rates were actually negative, providing a strong incentive to borrow money. Some of the borrowed money was used to purchase rapidly appreciating farmland. Conversely, real interest rates jumped from 1981 to 1985 when nominal interest rates increased rapidly just as expectations of future inflation were diminishing. The resulting increase in the real interest rate of mortgages has been cited as a cause of the slide in farmland values in the early and mid-1980s. Inflation, lending policies of farm credit agencies and banks, and speculation also affect farmland values. And of course farmland values vary by sitespecific characteristics like access to major highways, proximity to commodity and input markets, aesthetic appeal, and homesite potential."}, {"section_title": "Nonmarket Public Goods Provided by Farmland", "text": "Farmland also provides nonmonetary benefits. Until recently, these \"rural amenity\" benefits were supplied in such abundance that they were rarely acknowledged. But as the Nation becomes more urbanized, with the concomitant loss of farms and interspersion of urban-related activities, the decrease in those amenities has become a source of concern. The nonmonetary benefits potentially reduced or eliminated by loss of farmland and open space include recreation opportunities, aesthetic enjoyment from viewing landscapes and wildlife, environmental quality, and nostalgia related to the historic and cultural significance of rural life.

A recent USGS study examined water quality effects of fecal coliform bacteria from confined and unconfined animal operations.

Very small farms account for a particularly large share of farms in the limited-resource (72 percent), retirement (76 percent), and residential/lifestyle (76 percent) groups. Production, however, is concentrated among larger farms; small farms account for only 27 percent of the total value of production. The smallness of most farms has implications for conservation and the environment. An ERS study found that smaller corn farms are less likely to use conservation tillage than are larger farms (Soule et al., 1999 and. The practice is more practical for larger farms because they have more acres over which to spread the cost of new or retrofitted equipment necessary to adopt conservation tillage. Small farms whose operators are retired or farm part-time are also less likely to adopt conservation tillage, possibly because of hesitancy to change familiar production practices. Small farms, however, participate widely in the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) and the For more information about the farm typology, see the 2004 Family Farm Report (Banker and MacDonald, 2005).

These farms harvest most of the land planted to program commodities and therefore receive three-quarters of commodity program payments. However, CRP and WRP-the two major conservation programs-are targeted at particular types of land, not commodities. Since small farms own 70 percent of the land held by farms, they play a large role in natural resource and environmental policy. (For more information about CRP and WRP, see Chapter 5.2, \"Land Retirement Programs\".) Retirement, residential/lifestyle, and low-sales farms account for nearly twothirds of conservation payments and a similar share of the land farmers enrolled in the CRP and WRP. Participating farmers in each of the three groups tend to enroll large shares of their land in these programs: 46 percent of the land operated on retirement farms, 28 percent on residential/lifestyle farms, and 23 percent on low-sales farms. In contrast, enrollment ranges from 5 to 9 percent for participating high-sales, large, and very large farms. Because their main job is off-farm, residential/lifestyle operators are limited in the amount of time they can spend farming. As a result, residential/lifestyle farmers find CRP and WRP attractive, since these programs require little time.

This decline may reflect increasing rental costs as parcels of land become smaller. Parcels of farmland available to rent tend to become subdivided with time due to division among heirs (Raup, 2003). Smaller parcels increase transaction costs to operators assembling land to expand their operations. Still, rented land as a share of total farmland is higher than the 35percent rate that prevailed in the 1950s and 1960s. About 38 percent of all farms rented land in 2003, 32 percent as part owners and 6 percent as tenants (table 1.3.1). Land leasing has changed from a way for beginning farmers to enter agriculture to a way for established farmers to access additional land. Renting allows farms to expand without the debt and commitment of capital associated with ownership (Reimund and Gale, 1992). In fact, about 17 percent of very large family farms are tenants, a larger percentage than in any other group. Conventional wisdom holds that farmland owners have a long-term interest in their land and thus are more likely than renters to adopt conservation practices. Soule andothers (1999 and found this to be true among corn farmers, at least in the adoption of conservation practices that provide only long-term benefits, such as grassed waterways and strip cropping. The situation was different for conservation tillage, which can increase profits in the short run by maintaining or increasing yields while reducing machinery, fuel, and labor costs (Magleby, 2003). Cash-renters are less likely than owner-operators to use conservation tillage, but share-renters appear to act like owner-operators in adopting conservation tillage. Sharerenters may have an incentive to adopt conservation tillage, if the landlord bears some of the costs that may increase under conservation tillage, such as herbicide expenditures. Share-landlords are also more likely to be involved in management decisions than cash-landlords, which may make sharerenters act more like owners."}, {"section_title": "Concentration of Production", "text": "Concentration of agricultural production on fewer farms and fewer acres has grown since the beginning of the 20th century. In 1900, half of farm sales came from approximately 17 percent of farms and 43 percent of the land in farms ( fig. 1.3.3). By 2002, half of farm sales came from 2 percent of U.S. farms and 11 percent of the land in farms. This reflects both a growing diversity in farm size and an increasing number of very large farms. The concentration of agricultural production raises concerns about potential harm to the environment, especially from livestock operations. Data from the Note: The share of sales in 1900, 1949, and 1969 was calculated by summing sales by sales class from census publications and totaled slightly more than 50 percent. The share of sales in 1987, 1992, 1997, and 2002  census of agriculture show that the number of U.S. farms selling hogs decreased by 94 percent between 1959 and 2002, while hog sales more than doubled. Similar trends have occurred among farms selling dairy products, cattle, and broilers. As livestock producers expand, they are more likely to buy feed grown elsewhere, reducing the amount of land they have available for manure application, the predominant method of disposal (Ribaudo et al. 2003). More livestock production on fewer farms may not pose a problem if farms with livestock have enough land to absorb the manure produced. In fact, most farms currently have adequate land to safely use the manure that their livestock produce. Many livestock producers, however, do not apply manure to all their land (Ribaudo, 2003). Manure is expensive to haul, so many producers spread more manure than crops need on the fields nearest the livestock facility. In addition, adequate farmland for manure disposal may not exist in some areas with large concentrations of livestock. For example, there are 68 counties where nitrogen in manure from confined livestock and poultry farms is estimated to exceed the county's nitrogen needs. Excess phosphorus is even more common, occurring in 152 counties.

Agriculture (159 maf) and thermoelectric power generation (152 maf) dominate withdrawals, with domestic and commercial water supplies, industry, and mining withdrawing a combined 75 maf (Hutson et al., 2004). Agricultural withdrawals as a share of U.S. freshwater withdrawals declined from 46 percent in 1960 to 41 percent in 2000. 1 Thermoelectric power generation increased its share from 32 to 39 percent over the same period. Water withdrawals are not the only measure of water use. Consumptive use-the water not returned to the immediate water environment-is much greater for agriculture than any other sector, both in total and as a share of water withdrawn. Estimates available from 1960 through 1995 show that agriculture accounts for over 80 percent of the Nation's consumptive use (fig 2.1.1), because a high share of applied irrigation water is used by plants for evapotranspiration, with little returning to surface or ground water. (Water diverted for cooling thermoelectric plants tends to be used as a thermal sink, with much of it returned to rivers and streams.) Greater irrigation withdrawals do not necessarily translate into greater consumptive use per irrigated acre. The difference between withdrawals and consumptive use highlights the importance of losses, runoff, and return flows. Most agricultural water withdrawals occur in the arid Western States where irrigated production is concentrated. In 2000, about 85 percent of total agricul- tural withdrawals occurred in a 19-State area encompassing the Plains, Mountain, and Pacific regions (table 2.1.1). In the Mountain region, over 90 percent of the water withdrawn is used by agriculture, almost all (96 percent) for irrigation. Nationally, irrigation is the dominant agricultural water use, but water withdrawn for livestock and aquaculture production (including fish hatcheries) accounts for almost 20 percent of withdrawals in the North-Central and Eastern States. Even in these more humid States, irrigation is the dominant agricultural water use. Surface water accounted for 59 percent of total irrigation withdrawals in 2000, with ground water supplying the remainder. Ground water is a growing source of agricultural water supplies, increasing from 37 to 41 percent of total withdrawals since 1960. Ground water supplied most of the irrigation water in the eastern 37 States, the area experiencing the most irrigation growth in the past decade. In the Pacific and Mountain regions, surface-water supplies are still the dominant water source (table 2.1.1). Environmental harm can occur whenever water is withdrawn for agriculture (or any other extractive use). Surface-water withdrawals include either the gravity diversions of rivers and streams or the pumping of water from lakes, rivers, or streams, which can reduce (or totally dry up) streamflow and impair species habitat and wetlands. Ground water is withdrawn with pumps from wells drilled into underground water-bearing strata. When withdrawals exceed natural rates of aquifer recharge, the extraction of ground water can cause land subsidence, reduce total water reserves, and reduce base streamflow, thereby triggering surface-water shortages."}, {"section_title": "Irrigated Land and Associated Water", "text": "In 2002, U.S. irrigated farmland occupied 55.3 million acres, down 1 million acres from 1997 (table 2.1.2).

Source: USDA, Census of Agriculture, selected years. Substantial variation within the trend can largely be explained by year-toyear changes in four factors: farm program requirements, crop prices, water supplies in the West, and weather influences on the need for supplementary irrigation in humid areas. In recent years, national irrigated area has plateaued at about 55 million acres as continuing growth in eastern States has been offset by declines in western irrigation. Since 1988, western irrigated area has been affected by two extended droughts that led to water supply problems, especially in the Southwest. In general, there is an increasing reliance on irrigation in the humid East, and a northward redistribution of irrigation in the West (fig. 2.1.3). In recent decades, large concentrations of irrigation have emerged in humid areas-Florida, Georgia, and especially in the Mississippi Delta, primarily Arkansas and Mississippi. Averaged over all States and crops, the average depth of water applied has declined by one-fifth (5.4 inches per-acre) since 1969, to annual application levels of less than 20 inches in 2003 (fig. 2.1.2). Agriculture has adopted more water-conserving practices and shifted irrigated production of some commodities to more humid and cooler areas, requiring less supplementary water. Irrigation application can vary from less than 6 inches per acre (sorghum in the North-Central States) to more than 4.5 feet per acre (orchards in the Mountain States). (Water use rates in 2003 were affected by extended drought in the West, especially the Southwest. Surface-water allocations dipped below 50 percent of normal levels in some areas.) Changes in total water applied to irrigated lands reflect efficiency gains per acre, shifts in crop locations, and changes in acres irrigated. Per-acre declines in application rates (see Chapter 4.6, \"Irrigation Water Management\") have partially offset the increase in irrigated acreage since 1969. Over 1969-2003, irrigated acreage increased by over 40 percent while total water applied increased by only 11 percent.\nEconomic Research Service/USDA  \nEconomic Research Service/USDA One animal unit is defined as 1,000 lbs live weight (e.g. 1 AU = 1.14 feedlot beef, 0.74 dairy cow, 9.09 swine for slaughter, or 455 broilers).

Waste from unconfined (pasture-based) operations remains largely unregulated, although it may impair local water quality. Roughly half of the manure nutrients produced on U.S. animal farms was generated by unconfined livestock in 1997 (fig. 5.5.3), including 3.3 million tons of manure nitrogen (51 percent) and 1.0 million tons of manure phosphorus (54 percent). 4\nEconomic Research Service/USDA 4 These estimates likely understate the potential impact of manure nutrients on grazing lands, as (1) a share of animals on confined operations are pastured for a portion of the year; (2) recoverable manure from confined operations may be land-applied on pasture, either on or off the source farm; and (3) values do not reflect manure production from all animal types typically pastured. problem detection; higher weaning weights; and reduced problems with noxious weeds and other undesirable plant species. In many cases, however, public incentives will be required to encourage adoption of recommended grazing practices, particularly where benefits primarily occur offsite."}, {"section_title": "Irrigation Water Prices and Costs", "text": "Prices paid for irrigation water are of considerable policy interest due to their importance as a cost of production and their impact on water demand. Increasingly, adjusting the water \"price\" is viewed as a mechanism to improve the economic efficiency of water use. However, water price adjustments to achieve socially desired outcomes can be difficult because prices paid for water are rarely set in a market and generally do not convey signals about water's scarcity. States generally administer water resources and grant (not auction) rights of use to individuals without charge, except for minor administrative fees. As a result, expenditures for irrigation water usually reflect water's access and delivery costs alone-thus, costs to irrigators usually do not reflect the full social cost of water use. (By contrast, those without an existing State-allocated water right-whether an irrigator, municipality, industry, or environmental group-that purchase annual water allocations or permanent water rights from existing users pay prices that more closely reflect the scarcity value of the resource.) Costs of supplying irrigation water vary widely, reflecting different combinations of water sources, suppliers, distribution systems, and other factors such as field proximity to water, topography, aquifer conditions, and energy source. To generalize, ground water is usually pumped onfarm with higher energy expenses than surface water, which is often supplied from off-farm sources through extensive storage and canal systems. We use data from the Farm and Ranch Irrigation Survey (USDA, 2004b) to examine the cost determinants for ground-and surface-water sources. 2 Ground water is used on nearly half of U.S. irrigated farms, with the pumped ground water supplying over 32 million acres (table 2.1.3). Energy costs in 2003 ranged from $7 per acre in Maryland to $79 per acre in California, $92 in Arizona, and over $175 per acre in Hawaii. Average costs nationwide were almost $40 per acre, and total expenditures for the sector exceeded $1.2 billion. Surface-water energy costs reflect pumping and pressurization requirements for conveyance and field application. 3 Over 10.5 million surfacesupplied acres incurred these costs in 2003, at an average cost of $26 per acre (table 2.1.3). Costs ranged from $10 per acre in Missouri to $36 in California, $41 in Washington, and $82 in Massachusetts. In general, energy costs are less for pumping surface water than ground water since less vertical lift is required. Nearly 40 percent of irrigated farms received water from off-farm water supplies, accounting for nearly 14 million irrigated acres. Irrigators paid an average of $42 per acre for water from off-farm suppliers, including about 20 percent of farms reporting water at zero cost (table 2.1.3). Average costs ranged from $5 per acre in Minnesota to $46 in Washington, $72 in Arizona, and $86 in California. Much of the off-farm water is used in California, with over 30 percent of the Nation's acres served by off-farm sources. About 120,000 farms, accounting for three-fourths of the irrigated acreage, report incurring maintenance and repair expenses related to irrigation. Costs Agricultural Resources and Environmental Indicators, 2006 Edition / EIB-16 Economic Research Service/USDA 2 Acres irrigated reported in the 2003 Farm and Ranch Irrigation Survey (FRIS) exclude certain types of irrigated farms accounting for about 10 percent of the irrigated land reported in the 2002 Census of Agriculture. FRIS is the sole data source reporting both cost information and acres irrigated by water source. average over $12 per acre, which increases the cost of water by at least onethird over the cost of water supplies alone (table 2.1.3). In addition, 40 percent of farms reported capital expenditures of over $13,000 per farm for irrigation equipment, facilities, land improvements, and computer technology in 2003."}, {"section_title": "Policy Issues", "text": "Several types of organizations serve as \"off-farm suppliers\" of water to irrigators, but most are nonprofits that provide dependable water service at low cost. Some such organizations have developed extensive regional water storage and conveyance facilities, while others serve as a local water retailer, transferring water from a wholesaler (such as the Bureau of Reclamation) to water users. Water pricing by these organizations is often based on acreage served rather than water delivered, since administrative costs are lower with acreage-based charges. With this pricing system, producers have little financial incentive to conserve water since charges are assessed independently of how much water allotment is used. The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation), U.S. Department of the Interior, is the primary Federal agency involved in developing and managing water supply projects for irrigation purposes. Reclamation serves as a water \"wholesaler\" for about 25 percent of the West's irrigated acres-collecting, storing, and conveying water to local entities that, in turn, serve irrigators. From 1902 through 1994, the Reclamation program constructed 133 projects that provide irrigation water, costing $21.8 billion. Irrigation is scheduled to pay less than half of its allocated share of construction costs, with Agricultural Resources and Environmental Indicators, 2006 Edition / EIB-16 Economic Research Service/USDA most of the cost subsidized by hydropower revenue (General Accounting Office, 1996). New demands on water for urban growth and environmental restoration in areas with Reclamation projects have focused attention on issues such as the recovery of water-supply subsidies, improved economic efficiency, and increased conservation through water pricing. Increasing water demands for urban and environmental purposes have prompted discussions on how to more accurately reflect the opportunity costs of water in prices paid by irrigators. Several options exist for States (and in some cases Reclamation) to modify price or quantity allocations to more accurately reflect the scarcity value of water and to improve social benefits. Voluntary water markets are one prominent strategy to meet new water needs. However, current markets have transactions totaling only 1 to 2 percent of irrigation withdrawals, with volumes concentrated in a few States (Howitt and Hansen, 2005). Markets are most active in areas where there are fewer barriers (defined property rights, institutional flexibility, and developed physical infrastructure), or demand is such that participants are willing to pay significant transaction costs. The most prevalent type of exchange, with nearly 90 percent of the volume, is water leases (especially annual transfers), with permanent transfer of water rights and option markets the remainder. Irrigated agriculture is likely to remain important, both in terms of the value of agricultural production and demand on land and water resources (National Research Council, 1996). However, changes in the irrigation sector are anticipated in response to increasing water demands for urban and environmental uses, as well as evolving institutions governing farm programs and water allocations. Water diversions for agricultural production will likely continue to decline, with at least some portion shifted to satisfy alternative goals."}, {"section_title": "Major Agricultural Pollutants", "text": "Sediment is the largest contaminant of surface water by weight and volume (Koltun et al., 1997) and is identified by States as the second leading pollution problem in rivers and streams and the third leading problem in lakes (USEPA, 2002). Sediment in surface water is largely a result of soil erosion (see Chapter 4.2, \"Soil Management and Conservation\"), which is influenced by soil properties and the production practices farmers choose. Sediment buildup reduces the useful life of reservoirs. Sediment can clog roadside ditches and irrigation canals, block navigation channels, and increase dredging costs. By raising streambeds and burying streamside wetlands, sediment increases the probability and severity of floods. Suspended sediment can increase the cost of water treatment for municipal and industrial water uses. Sediment can also destroy or degrade aquatic wildlife habitat, reducing diversity and damaging commercial and recreational fisheries. Regions with the greatest potential to discharge sediment from cropland to surface waters include parts of the Heartland, Mississippi Portal, and Prairie Gateway (see the ERS website for a description of Farm Resource Regions for a description) (fig. 2.2.1). Nitrogen and phosphorus are important crop nutrients, and farmers apply large amounts to cropland each year. They can enter water resources through runoff and leaching. The major concern for surface-water quality is the promotion of algae growth (known as eutrophication), which can result in decreased oxygen levels, fish kills, clogged pipelines, and reduced recreational opportunities. USGS has found that high concentrations of nitrogen in agricultural streams are correlated with nitrogen inputs from fertilizers and manure used on crops and from livestock waste (see AREI Chapters 4.4, 4.5). Nine percent of domestic wells sampled by USGS's National Water Quality Assessment Program (NAWQA) during 1993-2000 had nitrate concentrations exceeding EPA's drinking water standard (maximum contaminant level or MCL) of 10 milligrams per liter, and agriculture was identified as the major source. EPA reported in its Water Quality Inventory that nutrient pollution is the leading cause of water quality impairment in lakes and a major cause of oxygen depletion in estuaries. Watersheds with a high potential to deliver nitrogen to surface water are primarily in the Eutrophication and hypoxia (low oxygen levels) in the northern Gulf of Mexico have been linked to nitrogen loadings from the Mississippi River (NOS, NOAA, 1999). Agricultural sources (fertilizer, soil inorganic nitrogen, and manure) are estimated to contribute about 65 percent of the nitrogen loads entering the Gulf from the Mississippi Basin . As much as 15 percent of the nitrogen fertilizer applied to cropland in the Mississippi River Basin makes its way to the Gulf of Mexico. The Gulf of Mexico is not the only coastal area affected by nutrients. Recent research by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration has found that 44 estuaries (40 percent of major U.S. estuaries) exhibit highly eutrophic conditions, caused primarily by nitrogen enrich-Agricultural Resources and Environmental Indicators, 2006 Edition / EIB-16 Economic Research Service/USDA Potential nitrogen leaching to ground water Lower 25% 50% -75% Upper 25%"}, {"section_title": "Watersheds", "text": "Source: Economic Research Service, USDA, based on nitrogen data from Association of American Plant Food Control Officials (1998) and . \nSource: Economic Research Service, USDA, based on phosphorus data from Association of American Plant Food Control Officials (1998) and . ment (Bricker et al., 1999). These conditions occur in estuaries along all coasts, but are most prevalent in estuaries along the Gulf of Mexico and Mid-Atlantic coasts. Watersheds with a high potential to discharge nitrogen from agriculture to estuaries are located primarily in the Heartland, Mississippi Portal, and Southern Seaboard regions. Farmers apply a wide variety of pesticides to control insects (insecticides), weeds (herbicides), fungus (fungicides), and other problems (see Chapter 4.3, \"Pest Management\"). Well over 500 million pounds (active ingredient) of pesticides have been applied annually on farmland since the 1980s, and certain chemicals can travel far from where they are applied. Pesticide residues reaching surface-water systems may harm freshwater and marine organisms, damaging recreational and commercial fisheries. Pesticides in drinking water supplies may also pose risks to human health. At least one of seven prevalent herbicides was found in 37 percent of the groundwater sites examined by USGS as part of the National Water Quality Assessment Program, but all at low concentrations. Watersheds with a high propensity to discharge pesticides to surface water are located primarily in the Heartland and Mississippi Portal regions (fig. 2.2.5). Watersheds with a high propensity to discharge pesticides to ground water are primarily in the Heartland, Prairie Gateway, and Southern Seaboard regions (fig. 2.2.6). Some irrigation water applied to cropland may run off the field into ditches and to receiving waters (see AREI Chapters 2.1 and 4.6). These irrigation return flows often carry dissolved salts as well as nutrients and pesticides into surface or ground water. Increased salinity levels in irrigation water can reduce crop yields or damage soils such that some crops can no longer be grown. Increased concentrations of naturally occurring toxic minerals-such as selenium, molybdenum, and boron-can harm aquatic wildlife and impair water-based recreation. Increased levels of dissolved solids in public drinking water supplies can increase water treatment costs, force the development of alternative water supplies, and reduce the lifespans of water-using household appliances. Dissolved salts and other minerals are a significant cause of pollution in the Prairie Gateway and arid portions of the Fruitful Rim and Basin and Range. Selenium is of particular concern because of its adverse biological effects. Selenium in irrigation return flows was identified as the cause of mortality, congenital deformities, and reproductive failures in aquatic birds in Kesterson Reservoir in western San Joaquin Valley, California (Seiler et al., 1999). A Department of Interior study of the Western United States found that 4,100 square miles of land irrigated for agriculture is susceptible to selenium contamination, along with adjacent land that may receive return flows (Seiler et al., 1999). Affected areas are primarily in California, western Kansas, eastern Colorado, and western South Dakota. The possibility of pathogens contaminating water supplies and recreation waters is a continuing concern. Bacteria are the largest source of impairment in rivers and streams, according to EPA's water quality inventory. Potential sources include inadequately treated human waste, wildlife, and animal feeding operations (see Chapter 4.5, \"Animal Agricultural and the Environment\"). Diseases from micro-organisms in livestock waste can be contracted through direct contact with contaminated water, consumption of contaminated drinking water, or consumption of contaminated shellfish. Bacterial, rickettsial, viral, fungal, and parasitic diseases are potentially transmissible from livestock to humans (CAST, 1996). Fortunately, proper animal management practices and water treatment minimize this risk. However, protozoan parasites, especially Cryptosporidium and Giardia, are important sources of waterborne disease outbreaks. Cryptosporidium and Giardia may cause gastrointestinal illness, and Cryptosporidium may lead to death in persons with compromised immune systems. These parasites have been commonly found in beef herds and Cryptosporidium is widespread on dairy operations (USDA, APHIS, 1994;Juranek, 1995)."}, {"section_title": "Potential delivery of phosphorus to surface water", "text": "Insufficient data"}, {"section_title": "25% -50%", "text": "Lower 25% 50% -75% Upper 25%"}, {"section_title": "Government Response to Agricultural Pollution", "text": "While agriculture's impacts on water resources are widespread and considered to be significant, the control of agricultural pollution is a challenge. The primary reason for this is that pollution from agriculture is generally \"nonpoint\" in nature. Nonpoint-source pollution has four characteristics that have an important bearing on the design of policies for reducing it. Nonpoint emissions are generated diffusely over a broad land area. These emissions leave from fields in so many places that it is generally not cost effective to accurately monitor emissions using current technology. Nonpoint emissions (and their transport to water or other resources) are subject to significant natural variability due to weather-related events and other environmental characteristics. Nonpoint emissions and the associated water quality impacts depend on many site-specific characteristics, such as soil type, topography, proximity to the water resource, climate, etc. Nonpoint pollution problems are often characterized by a very large number of nonpoint polluters. The difficulties in measurement, variability of discharges, and the site-specific nature make regulations used for point sources (factories and sewage treatment plants) largely inappropriate for nonpoint sources. As a consequence, water quality laws such as the Clean Water Act (see Chapter 5.7, \"Federal Laws Protecting Environmental Quality\") generally do not regulate agricultural pollution but, instead, pass most of the responsibility on to the States. This has resulted in quite varied responses, reflecting the States' particular resource concerns and organizational capacity. Thirty-three States have laws with provisions that regulate agriculture under certain conditions, such as when voluntary approaches fail to achieve water quality goals. States commonly use technology standards that require farmers to implement conservation plans that contain recommended management practices (Ribaudo and Caswell, 1999), such as conservation tillage, nutrient management, pesticide management, and irrigation water management. These plans can be required statewide, or in areas particularly vulnerable to agricultural pollution. By contrast, the Federal Government relies primarily on voluntary approaches, such as education and financial assistance (policy instruments), to encourage farmers to protect water quality. Major USDA programs such as the Environmental Quality Incentive Program and Conservation Security Program are important sources of information and assistance for farmers concerned with water quality (see Chapter 5.4, \"Working-Land Conservation Programs\"). Between 1997 and 2004, 37 percent of EQIP funds were devoted to water quality and conservation."}, {"section_title": "Wetland Exploitation: Settlement to 1954", "text": "Between the start of European settlement and 1954, 40-44 percent of original wetlands were drained or filled. 1 Most of this activity probably occurred after 1885, with as many as 80 million acres of wetlands and other areas drained by 1930 and, with a slowdown in conversions during the Depression and World War II, another 10-11 million acres drained between 1930 and 1954 (fig. 2.3.1). With the explicit encouragement of Federal policies and local cooperative efforts, wetlands were converted to agricultural and other uses at an average net rate of 814,000 to 887,000 acres per year between 1885 and 1954. Almost 30 percent of net wetland conversion during this period was in the Midwest, 22-24 percent in the Delta and Gulf region, and 14-16 percent in the Southeast (USDA, ERS, 2000). Data are insufficient to reveal gross changes from dryland to wetland, but some wetlands were probably restored or created as lands once converted were abandoned, drainage failed, and reservoirs or other impoundments saturated formerly dry land. Agricultural Resources and Environmental Indicators, 2006 Edition / EIB-16 Economic Research Service/USDA 1 Because we are not certain of the total wetland acreage prior to settlement, we provide range estimates of probable changes in wetland acres.

Restoration of dryland and deep water to wetlands averaged 273,000 acres per year, about 1 acre restored for every 3 acres converted. During this period, drainage shifted from the Midwest to the Delta and Gulf region (53 percent of all net conversion) and the Southeast (30 percent) (USDA, ERS, 2000). In the Delta, expansion for agricultural production in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Arkansas was probably the largest contributor to wetland conversion, although changes to coastal wetlands on the Louisiana gulf coast were also significant. In the Southeast, both urban and agricultural expansion in Florida and North Carolina were contributors. Net wetland acreage increased slightly in the Central Plains, Prairie Potholes, and Northeast, due to farmers' abandoning some agricultural land, increased rainfall expanding wetland area, and farmers' developing ponds and reservoirs on wetland fringes."}, {"section_title": "Wetland Policy Transition: 1974-82", "text": "Growing public interest in wetland benefits during the 1970s resulted in Federal policy changes, such as the Clean Water Act's Section 404 and Execu-Agricultural Resources and Environmental Indicators, 2006 Edition / EIB-16 Economic Research Service/USDA tive Order 11990, which began to reduce wetland conversions. Section 404 (see Chapter 5.7, \"Federal Laws Protecting Environmental Quality\") established a program to regulate the discharge of dredged and fill material into waters of the United States, including wetlands. Landowners are required to obtain a permit from the Army Corps of Engineers to begin work in wetlands. The permit process involves a public review in which all interested parties can comment on potential adverse impacts from the proposed wetlands conversion (Alvayay and Baen, 1990;USEPA, 1993). Section 404(f) exempts some ongoing activities-including many farming, ranching, and forestry practices-when wetland impacts are expected to be minimal. Executive Order 11990, signed by President Carter in 1977, directed Federal agencies to minimize the loss and degradation of wetlands and, instead, to improve the health of wetlands. As a result, the 1974-82 rate of net wetland conversions dropped by 37 percent, to 290,000 acres per year, despite higher market prices for crops and greater economic incentives for agricultural conversion. Gross conversion for agriculture dropped to 235,000 acres per year, but a large increase in conversions to other uses left total gross conversion at 446,000 acres ( fig. 2.3.2). Over this period, gross increases in wetlands fell to 156,000 acres per year, with agricultural lands accounting for more than half. Wetland was converted primarily in the Southeast, which had more than 60 percent of net conversion in 1974-82, and the Delta and Gulf region, which had 30 percent (USDA, ERS, 2000). Three-fourths of Southeast conversions were North Carolina wetlands converted to agricultural land, while lost wetlands in coastal Louisiana and agricultural conversion in Mississippi and Texas contributed to net changes in the Delta region.

The Wetland Reserve Program (WRP)-authorized in the 1990 Food, Agriculture, and Trade Act-has further reinforced wetland conservation (see Chapter 5.2, \"Land Retirement Programs\"). The WRP provides an easement payment and helps cover wetland restoration costs for cropland permanently converted back to a wetland. Furthermore, a policy goal of \"no net loss\" of wetlands is also affecting changes in wetland losses, preservation, and restoration (White House, 1991;. To date, the \"no net loss\" goal has been interpreted to mean wetlands should be conserved wherever possible, and that acres of wetlands converted to other uses must be offset through restoration and creation of wetlands, maintaining or increasing the wetland resource base (USDA, NRCS, 1995). The antecedent of the \"no net loss\" goal in Federal wetlands policy was the National Wetland Policy Forum. The Forum's blue-ribbon panel of environmental, agricultural, business, academic, and government leaders concluded that \"no net loss\" was a reasonable goal: Although calling for a stable and eventually increasing inventory of wetlands, the goal does not imply that individual wetlands will in every instance be untouchable or that the \"no net loss\" standard should be applied on an individual permit basis-only that the nation's overall wetlands base reach equilibrium between losses and gains in the short run and increase in the long term. The public must share with the private sector the cost of restoring and creating wetlands to achieve this goal (Conservation Foundation, 1988). Since initiation of no net loss, wetland area has begun to stabilize at around 134 million acres ( fig. 2.3.1). In 1982-92, net wetland losses fell to 79,000 acres per year-about 25 percent of the 1974-82 rate-and fell even further to 9,300 acres per year in 1992-2002 ( fig. 2.3.2). In 1982-92, wetland losses due to agriculture-at 31,000 acres per yearwere only 20 percent of total gross conversions. Losses to agriculture fell to 19,000 acres per year in 1992-2002-about 25 percent of the total losses. In 1982-92, 57 percent of all wetland losses were due to urban development. The building boom of the 1980s may explain the urban conversion rate of 89,000 acres per year, which is seven times the 1974-82 rate. Agriculture's role in wetland restoration appears to be growing. In 1982-92, agriculture supplied 10 percent (8,000 acres per year) of the restored wetland acreage. However, in 1992-2002, agriculture's contribution more than tripled to 28,000 acres per year-40 percent of the restored acreage. The Nation may be reaching its goal of no net loss. The most recent data-1997 to 2002-show a net increase in wetlands of 13,800 acres per year, along with a 45-percent drop in wetland conversions relative to 1992-97."}, {"section_title": "Beyond \"No Net Loss\"", "text": "On Earth Day 2004, the White House announced a new national goalmoving beyond \"no net loss\" of wetlands to an overall increase in wetlands and wetland quality. Specifically, the goal is to create, improve, and protect at least 3 million wetland acres over the next 5 years."}, {"section_title": "Costs and Benefits of \"No Net Loss\"", "text": "The \"no net loss\" policy has preserved wetland functions when a wetland is left unchanged and increased functions when a wetland is restored. Both public programs (e.g., Water Bank, swampbuster, and Wetland Reserve Program) 2 and private organizations (e.g., the Nature Conservancy and the North American Wetland Conservation Fund) have successfully secured these benefits. The economic benefits of a wetland are difficult to measure because the number, type, and quality of functions vary, as does the number of people affected across wetland sites. As a result, per-acre values of wetland benefits range from a few dollars to $300,000 or more (USDA, ERS, 2001a). Note that the value of a wetland can be high when many people are affected, even though the value to each individual is relatively low. The cost of \"no net loss\" is the opportunity cost of preserving or restoring a wetland. This cost equals the amount a firm or individual would pay for the right to convert a wetland-or the amount a landowner forgoes by not being able to sell the wetland for an alternative use. Swampbuster provisions (see Chapter 5.3, \"Compliance Provisions for Soil and Wetland Conservation\") limit farmers' ability to convert wetlands for agricultural uses, at an estimated average opportunity cost of $2,200 per acre-assuming that farmers are unable to sell wetlands for alternative uses and that swampbuster provisions will not expire (USDA, ERS, 2001b). In recent years, the public sector (primarily through the WRP) and private organizations have purchased development rights to protect wetlands. Purchase costs range from several dollars per acre for wetlands with little potential for conversion to hundreds of thousands of dollars for wetlands near urban development (USDA, ERS, 2001b). Acquiring rights to and restoring former wetlands can be less expensive than preserving a wetland. This is especially so when former wetland sites are marginally suited to economic uses-so that acquisition costs are low-and relatively easily restored. The acquisition costs associated with wetland restoration have averaged less than $800 per acre (USDA, ERS, 2001b)."}, {"section_title": "Wetland Acres and Wetland Functions", "text": "Net increases in wetland acres do not ensure increases in wetland functions. Functions lost when a mature wetland is drained can be greater than those gained when a similar type of wetland is restored. The grassy depressional wetlands of the Northern Plains-the Prairie Potholes-can reach maturity within 5 years. Conversely, hardwood wetlands can take 30 years or more to mature. Some restored wetlands may never provide functions that match those provided before conversion. Reasons include the impact of historic and current land use activities in the surrounding landscape, lack of appropriate restoration techniques, landowner preferences for establishing a wetland subclass other than the one fitting the landscape, and site modifications to address adjacent landowner concerns with hydrologic restoration (USDA, NRCS, 2002). USDA's NRCS initiated a National Wetlands Functional Assessment Pilot in March 1998. The model used in the pilot addressed the relative capacity of wetlands to perform various ecosystem functions (see box \"Wetland Functions Tracked in the NRCS Pilot Study\"). The models were able to register a modest increase in mean levels of wetland functions of restored USDA program wetlands versus their former state as drained and cropped. However, the pilot was not intended as a comprehensive assessment of the functional condition of USDA conservation program wetlands (USDA, NRCS, 2002). Successes of the pilot study suggest that continued NRCS research is likely to produce better models of wetland functions that can aid future policy analyses and program design."}, {"section_title": "For additional information on wetlands, go to:", "text": "USDA "}, {"section_title": "Wetland Functions Tracked in the NRCS Pilot Study", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Agriculture's Dependence on Genetic Resources", "text": "Agriculture and genetic resources are critically interdependent. All agricultural commodities, even modern varieties, descend from an array of wild and improved genetic resources from around the world. Furthermore, agricultural production depends on continuing infusions of genetic resources for yield stability and growth. Genetic improvements have arisen in several ways. Before the development of modern varieties, farmers cultivated landraces. Landraces are varieties of crops that evolved and were improved by farmers over many generations. The pace of crop improvement accelerated as modern breeding techniques were developed that facilitated selection of specific desirable traits. Breeders have crossed different parental material and selected traits resulting in higher yields, quality changes, and desirable production traits. Breeders have also sought resistance to pests and diseases, and tolerance to nonbiological stresses such as drought. Because pests and diseases evolve, breeders continually need new and diverse germplasm from outside the utilized stock, sometimes using wild relatives of cultivated crops and landraces, to find specific traits to maintain or improve yields (Duvick, 1986). USDA has estimated that new varieties are resistant for an average of 5 years, while it generally takes 8-11 years to breed new varieties (USDA, 1990). Plant breeders often rely on landraces or wild relatives as a last resort, because often it is more difficult to incorporate genetic material directly from these sources. Undesirable traits often accompany the trait of interest, and extensive breeding may be needed to produce a final variety. However, when used, genes from these materials have \"often had a disproportionately large and beneficial impact on crop production\" (Wilkes, 1991)."}, {"section_title": "Economic Values of Genetic Resources", "text": "Attaching a value to genetic resources is hard; describing their benefits is easier (Day-Rubenstein et al., 2005). The simplest value arises from the \"direct use\" of genetic resources to produce food and fiber or to help create new varieties of crops. Conserved genetic resources may also have economic value even if they are not being used at the time. The option to exploit resources in the future, for uses not presently known, has considerable value, though this value is difficult to measure. Also, the information about a conserved resource has economic worth. For example, the fact that a species of potato occurring naturally in the Andes has genes adapted for high altitudes may guide breeders toward a set of related germplasm in the future. Modern molecular biology techniques such as genomics hold promise for reducing the costs of searching for useful traits in conserved material, therefore increasing its value. At present, however, much work would be required to turn raw genetic sequence data into useful information (Attwood, 2000), and neither sequence data nor resources for sequencing are now available for landraces or wild relatives. Various economic methods have been used to value genetic material, but isolating the contribution made by genetic resources is difficult. Breeders use the genetic material to create new varieties, but the research effort by breeders has value as well. Thus, many studies have focused on the value of \"genetic enhancement,\" or the value arising from the use of genetic material by breeders. For example, the Office of Technology Assessment (1987) estimated that genetic improvements have accounted for half the yield gains in major cereal crops since the 1930s. Thirtle (1985) estimated the contributions of biological advances to U.S. crop production, controlling for changes in other inputs such as fertilizers, machinery, and pesticides, and concluded that biological improvements contributed to 50 percent of the yield growth of corn, 85 percent for soybeans, 75 percent for wheat, and 24 percent for cotton. Duvick (2005) estimated that 50 percent of the increases in maize (corn) yields since the early 1930s have been due to breeding. To date, practically all published economic analyses of the collection of genetic material, conservation in gene banks, or use of genetic resources in plant breeding programs have shown significant economic benefits from these activities. Besides estimating the total value of genetic improvements, it is also possible to estimate the distribution of these benefits. ERS researchers estimated the value of improved crop varieties by modeling the difference in economic welfare for both consumers and producers (crop and livestock) had there not been crop improvements in five major U.S. crops. U.S. producers generally gain as lower production costs outweigh the losses from lower commodity prices. Producer gains are estimated at over $160 million annually. Lower prices benefit consumers by an estimated $223 million per year. Together, the net economic effect from genetic enhancements is estimated at roughly $385 million per year. Economic welfare also rises worldwide. Consumer benefits from lower food prices outweigh producer losses, leading to net welfare gains estimated to exceed $600 million per year (table 3.1.1)."}, {"section_title": "Genetic Diversity", "text": "The loss of genetic diversity in a species, also called genetic erosion, has been identified in many commercially important crops. One reason for this decline in diversity has been the loss of landraces and wild relatives of cultivated crops. The loss of wild relatives occurs mainly through habitat conver-sion. Because the economic values of wild relatives can rarely be appropriated (i.e., captured) by landowners, they may have less incentive to preserve habitats for wild relatives than to devote land to alternative uses such as clearing for agricultural or urban use. Genetic erosion of crop varieties can be hastened as landraces are displaced by commercially developed varieties. Farmers want high yield potential and desirable consumption attributes, and commercial varieties are often superior in these respects. While maintaining a diverse set of landraces may benefit plant breeding, individual farmers are unlikely to account for this when selecting seed. Landraces, though, become extinct if farmers stop planting and maintaining them. Widespread adoption of genetically uniform crop varieties makes the crop population more susceptible to a widespread disease or pest infestation. Genetically uniform varieties may initially be more resistant to pests and diseases. But as pests and diseases evolve to overcome host plant resistance, genetic uniformity increases the likelihood that such a mutation will prove harmful to a crop; disease could affect newly vulnerable varieties accounting for a greater proportion of a crop's production. Genetic uniformity contributed to the spread of the Southern corn leaf blight, which reduced the U.S. corn crop by 15 percent in 1970. Since then, the genetic vulnerability of wheat and corn is thought to have lessened (in part because of efforts to breed in greater diversity), but the genetic uniformity of rice, beans, and many minor crops is still a concern (NRC, 1993;FAO, 1998). Despite concerns that crop yields and production will become more variable (Swanson, 1996), yields for many major crops have been relatively stable. This is probably because temporal diversity (diversity through time) has replaced spatial diversity (diversity across an area) (Duvick, 1984  germplasm cannot be appropriated because genetic material has public good characteristics. As a result, private breeders rely on the public sector to collect, characterize, and perform pre-breeding enhancement of genetic materials to make them available for private use (Duvick, 1991).

The world's gene banks presently hold more than 4 million accessions, or specific samples of crop varieties. However, crop genetic resources must be collected, and only a fraction of the world's germplasm has been collected thus far. Stored plant materials must be kept under controlled conditions, and periodically regenerated (planted and grown) in order to maintain seed viability (table 3.1.2). Not all kinds of plant genetic resources are easily conserved ex situ: some plants may need to be kept as living plants, a more costly process that requires additional land and labor. The resources necessary to maintain plant gene banks also face competing demands from other public programs.  USDA's Agricultural Research Service.

The NPGS supplies germplasm, free of charge, to anyone who requests it. Still, the United States continues to rely on other countries for genetic material. So, international agreements that affect the exchange of germplasm are an important tool for both U.S. policymakers and genetic resource managers. The U.N. Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), which came into force in 1993, is the most prominent international agreement addressing preservation of genetic resources. Historically, genetic material was regarded as the common heritage of humankind. Developing countries, the centers of origin for many crops, have often provided raw genetic material to public germplasm repositories. Whether forgone earnings from raw genetic material are compensated for by free access to public genebanks and lower world food prices is an open question (Shands and Stoner, 1997;Fowler, 1991). But the traditional \"free flow\" of \"unimproved\" genetic resources and landraces between countries is no longer a given. The CBD is the most well-known in a serious of multilateral agreements to address (among other issues) ongoing disputes over the exchange and use of plant genetic resources. President Clinton signed the Convention in June 1993, but the U.S. Senate has not ratified it yet. The United States attends meetings as a non-voting observer. In addition to the CBD, the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (IT) came into force in 2004. When terms are finalized, the treaty will govern the international exchange of germplasm for specified crops, including wheat, maize, rice, and alfalfa (though not other important crops such as soybeans, tomatoes, and peanuts). It is also intended as a mechanism to fund genetic resource conservation. As a result of the treaty, U.S. policymakers and genetic resource managers may soon face new exchange terms and rules governing benefit sharing. Many of the treaty's provisions are vague and uncertainties surround the valuation of crop genetic resources and the consequent sharing of benefits from germplasm preservation and exchange. The sources of funds for the preservation provisions of the treaty are also unclear. Germplasm can be categorized into three basic types: (1) elite or modern, (2) landraces, and (3) wild and weedy relatives. Elite or modern germplasm has been improved by plant breeders. It may be a final cultivar (either recently developed or obsolete), or it may be germplasm that has been modified by a breeder for use in creating cultivars. Because landraces and wild or weedy relatives often contain unique traits, they increase the diversity of a germplasm collection. At the same time, elite material also contains diverse genes, which may be less exotic, but are generally easier to use (NRC, 1993). Thus, curators and breeders typically will want all three types of germplasm in a collection. In addition to these three basic types, germplasm collections also may include \"genetic stocks,\" mutants and other germplasm with chromosomal abnormalities that are used by breeders."}, {"section_title": "Types of Germplasm", "text": "The expansion of intellectual property rights may further affect genetic resource conservation and exchange.

Public goods represent a market failure because an individual's use of the good does not diminish its availability to others, and it is difficult to exclude anyone from using the good.

The number of field releases of plant varieties for testing purposes provides a useful indicator of R&D efforts on GE crops. The release of GE varieties of organisms into the environment is regulated and monitored by USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS). Private companies and public institutions proposing tests of such organisms in the environment either notify APHIS of their intent or submit an application for a field release permit (referred to here as an application). If an APHIS review of the application (notification or permit application) establishes that there are no significant environmental risks associated with a release, a notification is acknowledged or a field permit is issued (referred to here as an \"approval\").

GE varieties of soybeans, corn, and cotton have been available commercially in the U.S. since 1996. Since then, their rate of use by U.S. farmers has climbed most years ( fig. 3.3.1). For the most part, farmers have adopted herbicide-tolerant (HT) varieties, which help control weeds, faster than insect-resistant varieties. Weeds are such a pervasive pest for soybeans, corn, and cotton that over 90 percent of planted acreage for each crop was treated with herbicides in recent years. Acreage share for HT soybeans has expanded more rapidly than that for HT varieties of cotton and corn, reaching 87 percent of U.S. soybean acreage in 2005. Farmers' adoption of HT soybeans has been widespread among major growing States, ranging in 2005 from 76 percent in Michigan to 95 percent in South Dakota.

In contrast, acreage share for HT corn reached only 26 percent in 2005, but this has also trended upward since 2001 (Fernandez-Cornejo, 2004b).

Acreage shares for Bt cotton and corn are lower than those for HT soybeans and cotton and vary much more across producing States, with adoption more concentrated in areas with high infestations of targeted pests (insect infestation varies much more widely across locations than does weed infestation  The recent increases in acreage share may be largely due to the commercial introduction in 2003/04 of a new Bt corn variety that is resistant to the corn rootworm, a pest that may be even more destructive to corn yields than the European corn borer.

In fact, yield potential may even decrease if the varieties used to carry the herbicide-tolerant or insect-resistant genes are not the highest yielding cultivars. However, by protecting the plant from certain pests, GE crops can prevent yield losses compared with non-GE hybrids, particularly when pest infestation occurs. This effect is particularly important in the case of Bt crops. Before the commercial introduction of Bt corn in 1996, the European corn borer was only partially controlled using chemical insecticides. The economics of chemical use was not always favorable, and timely application was difficult. For these reasons, many farmers accepted yield losses rather than incur the expense of chemical pesticides to treat the insect. Consequently, the use of Bt corn often resulted in yield gains rather than pesticide savings. On the other hand, a different Bt corn trait selected for resistance against the corn rootworm, previously controlled using chemical insecticides, may provide substantial insecticide savings. This new Bt corn variety was recently introduced commercially. An ERS study estimated the impact of adopting GE crops on yields using an adoption model and 1997 survey data (Fernandez-Cornejo and McBride, 2002, pp. 20-23). The study shows that an increase of 10 percent in the adoption of HT cotton led to a 1.7-percent increase in yields.

Because pest infestations differ across the country, the economic benefits of Bt corn are likely to be greatest where target pest pressures are most severe. The decision to use Bt corn must be made before observing the ECB pest pressure, and damage caused by the ECB varies from year to year.

Differences in the use of no-till between adopters and nonadopters of HT soybeans are even more pronounced: 40 percent versus 20 percent.

But producers are not the only ones to gain from the adoption of GE crops. Biotechnology developers and seed companies gain by charging technology fees and seed premiums to adopters of GE varieties. Ultimately, U.S. and foreign consumers may benefit from GE crops through lower commodity prices, which result from increased supplies.   ERS estimated the total market benefit arising from the adoption of three biotech crops in 1997: herbicide-tolerant soybeans, insect-resistant (Bt) cotton, and herbicide-tolerant cotton. Estimated benefits were around $210 million for Bt cotton, $230 million for HT cotton, and $310 million for HT soybeans (Price et al., 2003). This benefit includes the change in total welfare in both the seed input and commodity output markets. Estimated benefits and their distribution depend particularly on the analytical framework, supply and demand elasticity assumptions, crops considered, and year-specific factors (such as weather). There are tangible benefits to farmers who adopt first-generation GE crops. Not all of the benefits are reflected in standard measures of net returns. As in all studies, results should be interpreted carefully, especially since the impact studies are based on a few years of data. The impacts of GE crops vary with several factors, most notably annual pest infestations, seed premiums, prices of alternative pest control programs, and any premiums paid for segregated (i.e., non-GE) crops. These factors will continue to change over time as technology, marketing strategies for GE versus conventional crops, and consumer perceptions evolve.  . This rate is a remarkable achievement considering that labor has been departing the sector and land use has declined slightly, while capital influx has been modest. In spite of the growth in materials like fertilizer, fuel, and machinery, the net contribution of all inputs was slightly negative, leaving productivity growth as the sole source of output growth. While the contribution of other factors like labor, capital, and production inputs has risen or fallen with macroeconomic trends, one intangible input-productivity-has grown inexorably. But what is productivity? Productivity is not equivalent to output (or production). Productivity reflects improvements in the ability to transform inputs into outputs. In the most literal sense, it is a residual measure of the contribution to output growth after all other factors have been accounted for. It is the nonphysical product of innovation, efficiency, management, research, weather, and luck.

During 1973-79, U.S. agriculture experienced rapid growth, fueled by a growth in exports resulting from increased global liquidity, rising incomes, and production shortfalls in other parts of the world.

In addition, domestic forces-including a drop in interest rates and rising inflation-contributed to an increase in borrowing for the purchase of land and equipment. For much of the 1970s, real interest rates were close to zero and at times negative, reducing the cost of capital. Capital input in agriculture increased 2 percent per year between 1973 and 1979, adding an average 0.33 percentage points per year to output growth (table 3.4.1). Productivity growth is a reflection of technological change and efficiency improvements, e.g., better management or economies of scale, which result in producing more output from a given level of input.

In fact, USDA was the first Federal agency in 1960 to introduce multifactor productivity measurement into the Federal statistical program. Today, ERS routinely publishes total factor productivity (TFP) measures from production accounts that distinguish multiple outputs and inputs and adjusts for quality change in each input category. Its TFP model is based on the translog transformation frontier. It relates the growth of multiple outputs to the growth rates of capital, land, labor, and intermediate inputs, weighted by their shares in total costs. The changing demographic character of the agricultural workforce is used to build a quality-adjusted index of labor input. Similarly, much assetspecific detail underlies the measure of capital input. The contribution of feed and seed, chemicals, and energy are captured in the index of intermediate inputs. An important innovation is the use of hedonic price indexes in constructing measures of fertilizer and pesticide consumption. The result is a series of TFP indexes spanning 1948 to 2002. ERS defines the farm sector as it is defined in the U.S. national income and product accounts. Production of goods and services that are secondary to agriculture is assigned to the primary producing industry. This enables certain secondary activities closely linked to agriculture for which information on production and input use cannot be separately observed to be included in the total factor productive activity of agriculture.

Most of the increased demand is projected to come from developing countries, especially from Asia. Between 1961 and 1999, the FAO's aggregate crop production index grew at an average annual rate of 2.3 percent. Crop production per capita has increased for the world as a whole (at an average rate of 0.6 percent per year), and in all regions except Africa.

Growth has slowed markedly in the past decade, to about 0.1 percent per year, as a result of weak grain prices, deliberate policy reforms (in North America and Europe), and institutional change (in the former Soviet Union). FAO estimates that an additional 6.7 billion acres currently in other uses are suitable for crop production, but this land is unevenly distributed, and includes land with relatively low yield potential and significant environmental value. Given economic and environmental constraints on cropland expansion, the bulk of increased crop production will need to come from increased yields on existing cropland. FAO data indicate that world cereal yields rose by about 2.5 percent per year from 1961 to 1990, but growth slowed to 1.1 percent per year in the 1990s (fig. 3.5.3). Land quality-The ability of land to produce goods and services that are valued by humans. This ability derives from inherent/natural attributes of soils (e.g., depth and fertility), water, climate, topography, vegetation, and hydrology, as well as \"produced\" attributes such as infrastructure (e.g., irrigation) and proximity to population centers. Land degradation-Changes in the quality of soil, water, and other characteristics that reduce the ability of land to produce goods and services that are valued by humans. Some forms of land degradation, such as nutrient depletion, can be halted and even reversed relatively easily-for example, by balancing nutrient application with that taken up in harvested crops. Other forms of land degradation, such as erosion or salinization, can be slowed or halted through appropriate management practices, but are generally very costly to reverse. Agricultural productivity-A measure of the amount of agricultural output that can be produced with a given level of inputs. Agricultural productivity can be defined and measured in a variety of ways, including the amount of a single output per unit of a single input (e.g., tons of wheat per acre or per worker), or in terms of an index of multiple outputs relative to an index of multiple inputs (e.g., the value of all farm outputs divided by the value of all farm inputs) (see Chapter 3.4, \"Productivity and Output Growth in U.S. Agriculture\")."}, {"section_title": "Definitions", "text": "As a result of reduced input use (reflecting low cereal prices), market and infrastructure constraints, and low levels of investment in agricultural research and technology, IFPRI and FAO project that yield growth will slow further to about 0.8 percent per year over the next several decades (see Chapter 3.4, \"Productivity and Output Growth in U.S. Agriculture\"). Genetic improvements have contributed greatly to gains in yields and production of major crops, beginning with wheat, rice, and maize in the 1960s. About half of all recent gains in crop yields are attributable to genetic improvements. By the 1990s, 90 percent of wheat acreage in developing countries was in scientifically bred varieties, as was 74 percent of land in rice and 62 percent of land in maize. In developed countries, 100 percent of land in wheat, maize, and rice was in scientifically bred varieties by the 1990s (and probably even earlier). Gains from genetic improvements will continue, but likely at slower rates and increasing costs, as gains in input responsiveness have already been largely exploited (see Chapter 3.1, \"Crop Genetic Resources\"). FAO data indicate that increased fertilizer consumption accounted for onethird of the growth in world cereal production in the 1970s and 1980s. Growth in fertilizer consumption per hectare of cropland has been slowing, however, from a global average annual increase of about 9 percent in the 1960s to an average annual decline of about 0.1 percent in the 1990s. Among developing regions, per-hectare fertilizer consumption increased most rapidly in land-scarce Asia and most slowly in Africa. Growth in fertilizer consumption also slowed (and even declined) in developed regions, but remains at relatively high levels. Future fertilizer use will need to balance its potential to mitigate onsite land degradation (soil fertility depletion) with the risk of increased offsite degradation (impacts on water quality, for example) (see Chapter 4.4, \"Nutrient Management\"). Water will be a critical factor limiting crop production in the 21st century. Agriculture accounts for more than 70 percent of water withdrawals worldwide, and over 90 percent of withdrawals in low-income developing countries. The total extent of irrigated cropland worldwide has grown at an Agricultural Resources and Environmental Indicators, 2006 Edition / EIB-16 Economic Research Service/USDA average annual rate of 1.9 percent since 1961, although this rate has been declining. About 18 percent of total cropland area is now irrigated, most of it in Asia. Population growth and the increasing cost of developing new sources of water will place increasing pressure on world water supplies in the coming decades. Even as demand for irrigation water increases, farmers face growing competition for water from urban and industrial users, and to protect ecological functions. In addition, waterlogging and salinization of irrigated land threaten future crop yields in some areas (see AREI Chapters 2.1 and 4.6). The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), representing a broad scientific consensus, projects that the Earth's climate will change significantly over the course of the 21st century because of increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide and other \"greenhouse\" gases in the atmosphere. Global crop production would be little affected in aggregate, but potential impacts and adjustment costs vary widely, and could be quite high in some areas. For example, changing patterns of precipitation, temperature, and length of growing season resulting from a doubling of atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide would tend to increase agricultural production in temperate latitudes and decrease it in the tropics. ERS recently examined regional differences in cropland quality using geographic data on land cover, soil, and climate. About 13 percent of global land area has soils and climate that are of high quality for agricultural production ( fig. 3.5.4). Land quality changes over time as a result of natural and human-induced processes, but data on these changes are extremely limited. Only one global assessment has been done to date: the Global Land Assessment of Degradation (GLASOD) in 1991 (Oldeman et al., 1991). Based on the judgment of over 250 experts around the world, GLASOD estimated that 38 percent of the world's cropland had been degraded to some extent as a result of human activity since World War II. GLASOD identified erosion as the main cause of degradation (affecting 4 billion acres, mostly in Asia and Africa), followed by loss of soil nutrients (336 million acres, mostly in South America and Africa) and salinization (190 million acres, mostly in Asia). Previous studies have sought to measure land quality's role in explaining differences in agricultural productivity between countries, but have only considered factors such as climate and irrigation because of data constraints. ERS researchers incorporated the role of soil characteristics as well, and found that the quality of labor, institutions, and infrastructure also affect productivity. Holding other factors constant, ERS found that the productivity of agricultural labor is generally 20-30 percent higher in countries with good soils and climate than it is in countries with poor soils and climate. Based on climate and inherent soil properties, scientists with USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service have estimated water-induced erosion rates that vary widely by crop production area, soil, and region, but range in most cases between 5 and 7 tons per acre per year. Den Biggelaar et al. 2004recently reviewed over 300 plot-level experiments on yield losses due to soil erosion from around the world and found that for most crops, soils, and regions, yields decline by 0.01-0.04 percent per ton of soil loss. Combining these erosion rates and yield impacts allows estimates of potential annual yield losses to erosion in the absence of changes in farming practices. These estimates vary widely by crop and region. For example, corn yield losses to soil erosion range from an average of 0.2 percent per year in North America to 0.9 percent per year in Latin America. Differences in crop coverage limit comparison of regional totals, but aggregating across regions and crops generates an estimated potential erosion-induced loss of 0.3 percent per year in the value of crop production. These estimates represent potential impacts of water-induced erosion for selected crops on soils and in regions for which plot-level data were available. Estimated impacts would likely be larger if other degradation processes and crops were considered. On the other hand, actual impacts may also be smaller for any given crop and degradation process to the extent that farmers take steps to avoid, reduce, or reverse land degradation and its impacts."}, {"section_title": "Farmers Have Incentives To Address Land Degradation", "text": "Farmers choose between alternative technologies based on biophysical characteristics such as soil quality and access to water, as well as social and economic characteristics that include land tenure, income and wealth, and access to credit and information (see Chapter 4.1, \"Farm Business Management\"). Understanding of farmers' incentives is thus critical. For example, practices generating high net returns today may not do so indefinitely if they result in land degradation over time. But practices that reduce land degradation and offer higher net returns over time may require initial investments that inhibit adoption in the short term. ERS researchers explored such tradeoffs in a dynamic analysis of soils and economic data from the north-central United States. Results suggest that actual yield losses under practices that maximize net returns over the long run will typically be lower than potential losses derived from agronomic studies, and are generally less than 0.1 percent per year in the north-central United States. In order to benefit from a conservation practice that requires an initial investment, a farmer must anticipate farming a particular plot of land long enough to realize the benefit. A farmer with a lease that expires after 1 year, for example, receives only a fraction of the benefit that would be realized by a farmer with a 5-year lease, and both receive less benefit than would a farmer who owns his or her land. ERS research confirms that conservation choices by U.S. corn producers vary significantly with land tenure and the timing of costs and returns to different practices. Even with secure tenure and the prospect of long-term gains, a farmer might still be unable to afford the initial investment needed to adopt a particular conservation practice, perhaps due to poverty or constraints on access to credit. A farmer might also lack the information needed to compare longrun costs and benefits of alternative practices. Under such market imperfections, optimal choices by farmers would likely result in yield losses greater than those estimated under well-functioning markets, but still less than losses with no farmer response ( fig. 3.5.5). Farmers' responses to economic incentives lend support to the lower range of previous estimates of yield losses to land degradation. This does not mean that such losses are unimportant -just that they have historically been masked by increases in input use and improvements in technology and efficiency. Problems do exist in some areas, especially where resources are fragile and markets function poorly. Given projections that yield growth is slowing, yield losses to land degradation are likely to become more of a concern in the future."}, {"section_title": "Policymakers Play a Critical Role in Shaping Farmers' Incentives", "text": "When markets function well, private incentives to reduce land degradation will likely suffice to address onfarm productivity losses.

Clear and enforceable property rights are critical in providing incentives for landowners to conserve or enhance land quality. In some circumstances, it may also be necessary to offer direct payments to enhance farmers' incentives to adopt conservation practices. Such payments are well-established in conservation programs in the United States and in many other countries, but require careful attention to the timing and magnitude of payments in order to sustain incentives (see Chapter 5.1, \"Conservation Policy Overview\"). While such approaches pose daunting challenges in terms of implementation, they may also help achieve the broader agricultural, environmental, and food security objectives of the World Food Summit, the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, and other multilateral initiatives."}, {"section_title": "Characteristics of Farm Businesses' Managers", "text": "A farm's management unit consists of the individual or group responsible for decisions about how a farm will be operated. How a farm is legally organized is often viewed as being the same as its management. A proprietor makes decisions for proprietorships, partners for partnerships, and elected directors and officers for corporate farms. However, a farm's management unit may not be synonymous with its ownership. For example, land owners may or may not participate in management decisions. The Census of Agriculture reported in 1999 that 14 percent of landlords either made or shared in decisions related to selection of fertilizer and chemicals, while 13 percent helped decide cultivation practices (USDA, 1999). Legal organization, while helpful in indicating a farm's governance structure, may not reveal who participates in farm management. Even on proprietor farms, more than one person may participate in management decisions (see box, \"Farm Business Management\"). Of the 2.1 million U.S. farms reported by the Census of Agriculture, over 121,000 reported three or more operators (USDA, 2004). Together, farms reported 2.7 million operators. In 2003, the primary operator made crop decisions on 52 percent of farms, two operators made joint decisions on 12 percent of farms, and a third operator was involved on 1.3 percent of farms ( fig. 4.1.1). For the remaining 33 percent of farms, crop production was likely not a part of production activities. In the last decade, involvement by persons other than the primary operator has remained an important aspect of farm management. Operator and operator-spouse management teams controlled 59 percent of farms in 2003. When paid or informal advisors are considered, the share rises to 89 percent (table 4.1.1).

Nearly a third of these farms were commercial farms, versus about 3 percent for operator-only units and 7 percent overall. Each management structure that included outside advisors represented a disproportionate share of commercial-size farms. Operator-only management units had the highest average age, nearly 2 years older than the average for all primary operators. Primary operators in multiple-operator management units were youngest, age 54 on average. Primary operators that used outside assistance had the largest share of college-level attainments. This group was followed by multiple-operator teams and operators in operator-only units. Farms managed by operators only or by a combination of operators and spouses were more common in the Eastern Uplands, Southern Seaboard, and Mississippi Portal. These regions have a larger share of smaller farms run by operators who work off-farm. Farms run by multiple-operator teams and that used outside assistance were more common in the Heartland, Northern Crescent, Northern Plains, Fruitful Rim, and Basin and Range.

Production decisions focus on whether to produce crops, livestock, both, or nothing (for example, by placing land in conservation). Financial decisions center on acquiring and maximizing the use of inputs. Do managers have sufficient funds to buy inputs like seed or fertilizer (short-term decisions) or invest in capital items like equipment? If not, is borrowing warranted? Marketing options range from cash markets to contracts to direct sales (farmers' markets, the Internet, wholesale/retail buyers, or livestock producers.) Human resource issues include the amount and timing of labor needed to undertake production. In 2003, 45 percent of operators reported their primary occupation as other than farming. An even larger share worked offfarm.

Some farms amount to a single individual supplying all labor to produce one, or maybe even no commodities, with cash sales, and without debt. Other farms produce multiple commodities, market to various outlets, use a variety of labor sources, and take on debt from multiple lenders structured for different periods of maturation. One way to overcome this complexity empirically is to devise a classification system that jointly considers management choices. To develop the farm business system classification, each of four business areas-production, finance, human resources, and marketing/contract use-was measured as a dichotomous variable (see box, \"Classifying Farm Businesses\"). For example, farms producing 2 or fewer commodities were assigned a score of zero, while those with 3 or more commodities were given a score of 1. The same scoring convention was used for debt, hired labor, and cash sales versus production or marketing contracts. By equally weighting each of the four business activity areas, a total score ranging from 0 to 1 was calculated to reflect the overall complexity of the operation. For example, a score of 0 indicates a farm having two or fewer commodities, no debt, operator/family labor only, and cash sales. The scale was used to classify five groups of farms ranging from least (score of 0) to most complex organization (score of 1) based on use of business practices and arrangements. Farms are not distributed equally among the groups. Group 1, for example, accounted for 31 percent of farms in 2003, while Group 5 accounted for 3 percent (table 4.1.2)."}, {"section_title": "Characteristics of Farm Business Systems", "text": "The 31 percent of farms with the least complex farm business system controlled 11 percent of acres operated and generated less than 3 percent of production value in 2003.

Changes in crop and livestock production, including use of contract arrangements and technologically modified seed stock, mean that managers may need to interact more with both suppliers and customers. With the rising cost of inputs, particularly capital items such as machinery and equipment, managers also have to control a range of financial arrangements that transcend farm mortgages. Even land rents have become more complex, with some arrangements incorporating changes in prices and yields. As a farm grows, expertise to handle these tasks either has to be available within the existing owner-operator-management arrangement or be acquired by adding to the management team. Survey results suggest that the size and composition of management teams align with the complexity of farm businesses. The least complex farms were most often managed by a single operator or by a combination of operator and spouse. Conversely, the most complex businesses typically involved operators, spouses, other partners, and outside advisors.

Rotating high-residue and/or closely grown crops with row crops can reduce soil losses on erodible soils. Closely grown field grain crops-such as wheat, barley, and oats, as well as hay and forage crops-provide vegetative cover to reduce soil erosion and water runoff while adding organic matter. In addition, these crops help to control broadleaf weeds and may help control weed infestation in subsequent crops. Crop rotation also helps to break disease and insect cycles. Leguminous crops can increase nitrogen levels in the soil, and cover crops planted in the fall help reduce erosion from winter and spring storms, hold nutrients that might otherwise be lost, enhance the soil's biological processes, and lengthen periods of active plant growth (to increase nutrient cycling, disease suppression, soil aggregation, and carbon sequestration)."}, {"section_title": "Crop Rotation System Use For Major Crops", "text": "With the exception of cotton, rotational cropping in some form dominates major crop production in the United States. The most common rotation system for both corn and soybeans is a corn-soybean rotation. This combination reduces erosion (compared with continuous-corn or continuoussoybeans); helps control disease, insects, and weeds; and enables soybeans to fix nitrogen for use by the subsequent corn crop. Approximately 75 percent of corn acres and 80 percent of soybean acres in the 10 major producing States used this rotation system in the most recent surveyed year (2001 for corn and 2002 for soybeans) (figs. 4.2.1 and 4.2.2). The following definitions were applied to 3-year crop sequence data reported in the Agricultural Resource Management Survey to identify a cropping pattern for each sample field. The data were limited to the current year's crop plus the crops planted the previous 2 years on the sample field, with the exception of winter wheat in 1996. For this crop, only 2 years were used to determine the rotation due to data limitations. Monoculture or continuous same crop: crop sequence where the same crop is planted for 3 consecutive years. Small grains (wheat, oats, barley, flax, rye, etc.) or other close-grown crops may be planted in the fall as a cover crop. Continuous row crops: crop sequence, excluding continuous same crop, where only row crops (corn, sorghum, soybeans, cotton, peanuts, vegetables, etc.) are planted for 3 consecutive years. Small grains or close-grown crops may be planted in the fall as a cover crop. Continuous small grain crops: crop sequence, excluding continuous same crop, where only small grain crops (wheat, barley, oats, rye, etc.) are planted for 3 consecutive years Row crop/small grain rotation: crop sequence where some combination of row crops and small grains are planted over the 3-year period. Rotation with meadow crops: crop sequence that includes hay, pasture, or other use in 1 or more previous years. The rotation excludes any of the above rotations and any area that was idle or fallow in one of the previous years. Idle or fallow in rotation: crop sequence that includes idle, diverted, or fallowed land in 1 or more of the previous years. Winter wheat in a continuous cropping system (no rotation) reached a high of 47 percent of acreage planted in 2000 (most recent surveyed year) (figure 4.2.3). Winter wheat in rotation with a row crop or small grain (including double cropping) has trended upward in recent years, while rotation with fallow/idle has declined. Cotton is grown primarily in a continuous cropping system, with 73 percent of acreage in the five major States using this system in 2003.

Crop rotations usually result in yields higher than those achieved with continuous cropping under similar conditions. Rotations that add organic matter can improve soil tilth and water-holding capacity, and thus increase crop yields. Grain yields following legumes are often 10 to 20 percent higher than continuous grain, regardless of the amount of fertilizer applied (Heichel, 1987;Power, 1987). Corn following wheat produces a greater yield than continuous-corn with the same amount of fertilizer, even though wheat is not a legume and cannot fix atmospheric nitrogen (Power, 1987). Rotations with legumes can increase available soil nitrogen and reduce the need for commercial nitrogen fertilizers. Legumes in a rotation are most effective in humid and sub-humid climates where they do not decrease subsoil moisture for subsequent crops. Crop rotations-by alternating a susceptible crop with a nonhost crop-can help to control a variety of pests by disrupting their life cycles. Soil microbiology and beneficial insects thrive under crop rotations, and this helps control disease and other pests, particularly those that attack plant roots. For example, rotating corn with soybeans can reduce the need for insecticide treatment when the field is in corn by reducing the number of corn rootworm larvae in the soil (although the effectiveness of this practice may be decreasing in some areas). The diversification inherent in rotations can be an economic buffer against fluctuating prices of crops or production inputs and against the vagaries of weather, disease, and pest infestations.

CRM is generally cost effective in protecting soil and water resources and can lead to higher returns by reducing fuel, machinery, and labor costs while maintaining or increasing crop yields, but requires fewer resources than intensive structural measures and can be implemented in a timely manner to meet conservation needs (USDA, 1997). CRM systems include reduced tillage, conservation tillage (no-till, ridge-till, and mulch-till), and the use of cover crops and other conservation practices that leave sufficient residue to protect the soil surface from the erosive effects of wind and water (see box, \"Crop Residue Management and Tillage System Definitions\")."}, {"section_title": "Why Manage Residue?", "text": "Historically, crop residues were removed from farm fields for livestock bedding, feed, or sale. Residues that remained on the field were burned off to control pests, plowed under, or tilled into the soil. Culturally, some farmers would take pride in having their fields \"clean\" of residue and intensively tilled to obtain a smooth surface in preparation for planting. More recently, farmers have adopted CRM practices-with government encouragement-because of new knowledge about residue's benefits and improved planters, crop protection technologies, and the like (USDA, 1997). CRM can benefit society through enhanced environmental quality and farmers through higher overall economic returns. Crop Residue Management (CRM)-A year-round system that usually involves a reduction in the number of passes over the field with tillage implements and/or in the intensity of tillage operations, including the elimination of plowing (inversion of the surface layer of soil). CRM begins with the selection of crops that produce sufficient quantities of residue to reduce wind and water erosion and may include the use of cover crops after low-residue-producing crops. CRM is an umbrella term encompassing several tillage systems including conservation tillage (no-till, ridge-till, and mulch-till), and reducedtill. (Note: reduced-till is not considered a part of conservation tillage.) Conservation tillage-Any tillage and planting system that maintains at least 30 percent of the soil surface covered by residue after planting to reduce soil erosion. Two key factors influencing crop residue are: (1) the type of crop, which establishes the initial residue amount and its fragility, and (2) the type of tillage operations prior to and including planting. No-till, ridge-till and mulch-till are thee common types of conservation tillage systems. No-till-Residue from the previous crop is undisturbed from harvest to planting except for nutrient injection or narrow strips. Weed control is primarily accomplished with crop protection products. Ridge-till-Residue from the previous crop is undisturbed from harvest to planting except for nutrient injection. Planting is completed in a seedbed prepared on 4-to 6-inch high ridges that are formed and rebuilt during row cultivation for weed control. Residue is left on the surface between ridges. Mulch-till-A full-width tillage system usually involving one to three tillage passes over the field performed prior to and/or during planting, that leaves, after planting, at least 30 percent of the soil surface covered with residue. Reduced-till (15-30% residue)-Full-width tillage usually involving one or more tillage passes over the field performed prior to and/or during planting, that leaves 15-30 percent residue cover after planting. Conventional-till or intensive-till (less than 15% residue)-Full-width tillage that is performed prior to and/or during planting, that generally involves plowing with a moldboard plow and/or other intensive tillage equipment.

Conservation tillage accounted for 41 percent of U.S. planted crop acreage in 2004, compared with 26 percent in 1990. Most of the growth in conservation tillage since 1990 has come from expanded adoption of no-till ( fig. 4.2.5), which can leave 70 percent or more of the soil surface covered with crop residue. U.S. crop area planted with no-till more than tripled from 17 million acres (6 percent) to 62 million acres (22 percent) between (CTIC, 2005."}, {"section_title": "Economic Incentives For CRM Adoption", "text": "Yield response with soil-conserving tillage systems varies with location, soil characteristics, climate, cropping patterns, and level of management skills (Sandretto, 2001). In general, long-term field trials on well-drained to moderately well-drained soils or on sloping land show slightly higher no-till yields, particularly with crop rotations, compared with intensive tillage (CTIC, 1996). Benefits from improved moisture retention in the root zone usually increase crop yields, especially under dry conditions. In some areas, these benefits permit a change in the cropping pattern to reduce the frequency of moisture-conserving fallow periods (USDA, 1997). Other benefits derive from more timely preparation for double cropping, with better yields as one result. Crop yields can be significantly reduced by pest populations, which frequently change under different tillage systems and are also affected by cropping pattern. Maintaining or increasing yields when changing tillage systems requires skillful use of the various means of pest control, including crop variety selection, proper application of crop protection products, row cultivation, cover crops, crop rotation, scouting, and other integrated pest management practices (see Chapter 4.3, \"Pest Management Practices\"). Use of crop protection products on major crops differs among tillage systems, but the effects related to tillage systems are difficult to distinguish from differences in pest populations due to other factors, including use of other pest control practices (USDA, 1997). Choice of tillage system affects machinery, chemical, fuel, and labor costs. Decreasing the intensity of tillage and/or reducing the number of tillage operations (fewer trips over the field) reduces labor requirements per acre, extends equipment life, increases the area covered, and reduces fuel and maintenance costs. These cost savings may be offset by increased crop protection costs and the fertilizers required to attain optimal yields (Sandretto, 2001). Conservation tillage may increase net returns on the entire farming operation even if returns for a particular crop do not increase. For example, a tillage system that requires substantially less labor per acre and reduces returns per acre only slightly may free up labor to serve more acres or generate more income elsewhere (Sandretto and Bull, 1996)."}, {"section_title": "Potential Environmental Benefits of Crop Residue Management", "text": "Soil quality can benefit from minimum tillage and maximum residue, and this combination contributes to improved ecosystem health in several ways. Tillage systems that leave substantial amounts of crop residue evenly distributed over the soil surface reduce soil erosion, from reduced wind erosion and reduced kinetic impact of rainfall, surface sediment transport and water runoff; with increased water infiltration and moisture retention (Edwards, 1995). Several field studies conducted on small watersheds under natural rainfall on highly erodible land have shown that erosion rates with the moldboard plow can be reduced by 70 percent or more with conservation tillage (USDA, 1997). Surface residues help intercept nutrients and chemicals and hold them in place until they are used by the crop or degrade into harmless components, which provide cleaner surface runoff (USDA, 1997). Increased organic matter in the top layer of soil results in cleaner runoff, and thus benefits water quality by reducing the flow of contaminants such as sediment and adsorbed/dissolved chemicals into lakes and streams (USDA, 1997;CTIC, 1996). Studies under field conditions indicate that while the quantity of water runoff from no-till fields was variable depending on the frequency and intensity of rainfall, clean-tilled soil surfaces produce substantially more runoff (Edwards, 1995). Average herbicide runoff losses from treated fields under no-till and mulch-till systems for all products and all years were about 30 percent of the runoff levels from moldboard-plowed fields (Fawcett et al., 1994). Crop residues on the soil surface, by creating tiny dams, enhance infiltration, reduce surface-crust formation, and slow water runoff, which increases water infiltration and soil moisture (Edwards, 1995). The channels (macropores) created by earthworms and old plant roots, when left intact with no-till, improve infiltration to help reduce or eliminate field runoff and provide water quality benefits. Combined with reduced water evaporation from the top few inches of soil and with improved soil characteristics, the higher level of soil moisture can contribute to higher crop yields in many cropping and climatic situations (CTIC, 1996). Less intensive tillage reduces breakdown of crop residue and loss of soil organic matter improving long-term soil quality. Carbon sequestration may increase to build soil organic matter, enhance biological (including earthworm) activity, and maintain long-term productivity. Conservation tillage, particularly continuous no-till, improves soil structure by increasing soil particle aggregation (small soil clumps), aiding water movement through the soil so plants expend less energy to establish roots. No-till also reduces soil compaction through fewer trips over the field and reduced equipment weight and horsepower requirements (CTIC, 1996). These potential environmental benefits suggest a public role in encouraging adoption of crop residue management practices. Conservation compliance provisions of the 1985 Food Security Act and subsequent farm legislation have given farmers additional incentives to adopt CRM to control erosion (and thereby improve water quality), particularly on highly erodible cropland (HEL) (see Chapter 5.3, \"Compliance Provisions for Soil and Wetland Conservation\"). Expanded use of CRM practices on non-HEL indicates that producers are motivated by the potential to reduce costs, improve efficiency, and/or increase soil productivity."}, {"section_title": "Conservation Buffers and Structures", "text": "Soil and water conservation structures and buffer zones can significantly reduce erosion and sediment transport caused by rainfall and water runoff. These structures allow for surface water to be captured onsite or slowed and diverted from the field via erosion-resistant waterways, channels, or outlets. While management practices, such as crop rotation, crop residue management (including cover crops), and conservation tillage practices help to control erosion, they may not sufficiently control runoff water after heavy rainfall events. Soil-and water-conserving structures, therefore, are important in farm soil management systems. Engineering structures and buffer zones for soil and water conservation vary significantly across crop production regions to reflect the wide variation in soil, climate, and cropping patterns. A variety of USDA programs since the 1930s have provided cost-sharing and technical assistance for conservation buffers, structures, and practices (see Chapter 5.4, \"Working-Land Payment Programs\"). While recent program efforts have been directed toward management practices, including vegetative cover establishment and crop residue management, some cropland continues to be served by installation of terraces and other structural measures to better control sediment and water runoff."}, {"section_title": "Pesticide Use", "text": "Pesticide use can be measured by expenditures, quantity, and area of use. The measure for which estimates have been available for the longest time is million pounds of active ingredient (a.i.). However, this measure does not capture changes in the use of pesticide compounds applied at different rates (where the area treated is unchanged). Nor is total quantity a good measure of total pesticide toxicity, which varies by pesticide compound, or of risk, which can be mitigated by application practices. One measure of pesticide area is acre-treatments, which is the product of acreage treated and treatments per acre. We use this measure when discussing market shares of insecticides and herbicides, because some pesticides are applied at low rates per acre and account for small portions of total quantity applied, but large portions of total treatments. Agricultural pesticide expenditures reached an estimated all-time high of $9 billion in 1997-98 and totaled $8.3-8.5 billion in 2002-2004. Herbicides accounted for two-thirds of those expenditures, while insecticides accounted for about one-fifth in 2000 and 2001 (Kiely et al., 2004). Crop pesticide use peaked at an estimated 579 million pounds a.i. in 1997; in 2004, it was 495 million pounds a.i. (fig. 4.3.1, table 4.3.1). In recent decades, the development of new pesticides, increased use of practices such as genetically modified seed, and the regulatory process encouraged shifts in pesticide compounds used. Many, but not all, compounds increasing in total use are applied at lower rates per acre than those declining in total use, resulting in lower pesticide quantity. Rather than discuss hundreds of pesticide compounds, we show use of major insecticide and herbicide families measured by shares of total quantity applied and acre-treatments on five major crops: corn, cotton, potatoes, soybeans, and wheat. Among insecticides, the organophosphate share of acre-treatments and quantity applied was greater in 2000 than 1996, while pyrethroid and carbamate shares were less (table 4.3.2). Corn and cotton are the major insecticide markets among the five crops. The higher organophosphate share was largely due to higher malathion use on cotton for boll weevil eradication, which has since declined. According to NASS, malathion was used on 11 percent of cotton acres (with 6 treatments per acre) in 1997 and 1998, 40 percent (7 treatments per acre) in 1999, but only 11 percent (5 treatments per acre) in 2003. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), under a regulatory review of organophosphates (discussed below), determined that malathion use for boll weevil eradication was not a significant dietary and drinking water health risk (USEPA, 2000). The adoption of cotton seed genetically modified to produce the Bacillus thuringiensis toxin may reduce organophosphate, pyrethroid, and carbamate insecticide use for lepidopteran insects, such as bollworms and tobacco budworms (see Chapter 3.3, \"Biotechnology and Agriculture\"). Among herbicides, shares of acre-treatments and quantity for phosphinic acids-primarily glyphosate (trade name: Roundup) but also glufosinateammonium and sulfosate-were much higher in 2000 than in 1996 (table  4.3.3). At the same time, shares of amides, anilines, phenoxys, and triazines, widely used since the 1960s and 1970s, were lower in 2000. Shares of sulfonyl ureas and other new families increased before 1996, but there was little change between 1996 and 2000. Phosphinic acid shares were higher in 2000 than in 1996 on all major crops, but especially cotton and soybeans, where adoption of genetically modified seed tolerant to these herbicides has been widespread (see Chapter 3.3, \"Biotechnology and Agriculture\"). Phosphinic acids were the most used herbicides on cotton and soybeans in 2000; their share of herbicide acretreatments increased from 4 percent in 1996 to 30 percent in 2000 on cotton and from 10 to 42 percent on soybeans, while shares of other major herbicide families were stable or declined.

However, shares of sulfonyl ureas and other new herbicide families on corn and wheat were higher in 2000 than in 1996. (see \"Crop Production Practices\" in the ARMS Data Tool on the ERS website.) Since some producers used phosphinic acids and other newer post-emergence herbicides (applied after weed emergence) instead of older pre-emergence herbicides, the shares of corn, cotton, soybean, and spring wheat acres receiving post-emergence applications were higher and acres receiving pre-emergence applications lower in 2000 than in 1996. While producers treat many acres with both pre-and post-emergence herbicides, the shares of acres receiving post-emergence applications only were higher in 2000 than 1996, with the share of soybean acreage almost doubling from 28 percent in 1996 to 50 percent in 2000.

Prices of individual pesticides may behave differently, responding to different factors. The price for glyphosate fell by 22 percent from 1996 to 2003, which may reflect marketing strategy as well as its patent's expiring in September 2000. The lower price may have encouraged producers to use glyphosate and genetically modified herbicide-tolerant seed. The price for methyl bromide increased by 147 percent from 1996 to 2003, because EPA required supply reductions to implement the Montreal Protocol phaseout, beginning in 1999. Higher prices encouraged producers to use other pesticides, and focused methyl bromide use on crops and acres with higher returns. Based on USDA/NASS indices, pesticide prices have risen more slowly than wages, fuel prices, and crop prices since the late 1990s, which departs from the post-1980 trend of pesticide prices rising faster than crop and fuel prices ( fig. 4.3.2, table 4.3.4). Pesticide prices have risen more slowly than crop prices since 2000 and fuel prices since 1998.

Responding to its introduction in South America, USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service established a rust surveillance, information, and education program in 2002 to help domestic producers respond effectively. Asian soybean rust was first identified in the United States in late 2004. Historically, producers treat less than 1 percent of U.S. soybean acres with fungicides (excluding seed treatments). To prevent production losses from soybean rust, U.S. producers might increase fungicide use by 2.5-10.5 million pounds a.i. per year, with 20 to over 90 percent of soybean acres treated, depending upon the severity and extent of outbreak.

The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938 (FFDCA) regulates pesticide residues in food. The Food Quality Protection Act of 1996 (FQPA) amended FIFRA and FFDCA to set new standards for and to modify the regulation of pesticide residues in food. Under FQPA, EPA must consider dietary exposure from all food uses and drinking water, nonoccupational exposure such as homeowner use, and the susceptibility of infants and children in setting pesticide residue tolerances, as well as the cumulative effects of substances if there is a common mechanism of toxicity. FQPA required a reassessment of all existing pesticide residue tolerances by 2006, with priority to pesticides that pose the greatest risk to public health. EPA is coordinating the tolerance reassessment with the reregistration of pesticides to comply with new standards mandated in amendments to FIFRA in 1988. The reassessment resulted in revocations or modifications of some residue tolerances and cancellations or restrictions of some use registrations. Among the highest priorities are pesticides in the carbamate, organochlorine, and organophosphate families, or pesticides classified as carcinogens. EPA met FQPA-mandated interim goals, and by the end of fiscal year 2004 had reassessed about 73 percent of the 9,721 mandated tolerances, including about 67 percent of 1,691 organophosphate, 57 percent of 545 carbamate, 71 percent of 2,008 carcinogen, and all 253 organochlorine tolerances (USEPA, 2005a).

While nutrient use, in general, has been stable since 1990, modest trends for some crop/nutrient combinations are apparent. For example, the share of corn acres treated with phosphate and potash declined slightly, while the share of cotton acres treated with potash rose along with application rates.

Also, a significant price increase for fertilizer, especially nitrogen, in 2001 and 2003 likely dampened nutrient use during those years. Fertilizer application rates vary widely by crop and nutrient, and are influenced by yield response, climate, and fertilizer/commodity prices ( fig.  4.4.4).

Agricultural point sources include livestock operations, while nonpoint sources include fertilizers and animal waste applied to cropland.

Most Federal programs are directed at encouraging producers to alter cropping or nutrient application practices. These programs range from nutrient use regulations affecting producers of large confined animal operations to voluntary cost-sharing and educational/technical assistance programs available to all producers.

Structural changes have been driven by both innovation and economies of size (McBride and Key, 2003). Organizational innovations, such as production contract arrangements, enable growers to access the capital necessary to adopt innovative technologies and garner economies of size, with greater profit potential. The significant economic benefits from vertical coordination, particularly for poultry and swine operations, have led to both larger operations and greater geographic concentration of animals. The number of U.S. farms with confined animals (called animal feeding operations, or AFOs) has declined steadily from 435,000 in 1982 to 213,000 in 1997 (Gollehon et al., 2001). Declines occurred in all sectors, but primarily in the very small and small farm sizes (see box, \"Size Groupings\"). This decline in farms has been accompanied by a 10-percent increase in the number of confined animal units (AUs, defined as 1,000 pounds of live weight) ( fig. 4.5.1). A decline in AUs on very small and small farms was more than offset by growth on medium-sized farms and large farms (Gollehon et al., 2001). The regional distribution of confined animals also changed between 1982 and 1997. Animal populations in the Prairie Gateway and Southern Seaboard regions increased by 2 million (40 percent) and 1.7 million (70 percent) animal units over 1982-97 (fig. 4.5.2). Only the Northern Crescent and Heartland regions exhibited significant declines. The innovation and economies of size that underlie changes in the livestock and poultry sector also served to separate animal production from crop production. Large, specialized facilities today focus on producing animals and purchase most of their feed from off the farm. This means there is generally less land on the animal farm on which to spread manure.

Excess nutrients are susceptible to running or leaching off the field and into water resources unless steps are taken to move the manure off the farm to additional land or to other industrial uses such as energy production or commercial fertilizer production. In 1997, animal feeding operations controlled 73 million acres of cropland and permanent pasture. This land was estimated by Gollehon et al. (2001) to have the capacity to assimilate only 40 percent of the nitrogen and 30 percent of the phosphorus in the manure recoverable from animal production facilities and available as a crop fertilizer. Large farms, which constitute 2 percent of the total number of farms, accounted for almost half of the excess onfarm nutrients.  In 1997, 68 counties had manure nitrogen levels that exceeded the assimilative capacity of the entire county's crop and pasture land ( fig. 4.5.3). Many more counties (152) have surplus manure phosphorus ( fig. 4.5.4). In these areas, it may be difficult to find enough land locally to spread manure without posing a risk to water quality.

States reported to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 1996 that animal operations (feedlots, animal feeding operations, and animal holding areas) were a major factor in 5 percent of impaired rivers and streams, and a contributing source in 20 percent of rivers and streams reported as being impaired (U.S. EPA, 1998). 1 A United States Geological Survey (USGS) study of nitrogen loadings in 16 watersheds found that manure was the largest source in 6, primarily in the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic States (Puckett, 1994). In the Mississippi Basin, animal manure was estimated to contribute 15 percent of the nitrogen load entering the Gulf of Mexico; nitrogen is the suspected cause of a large zone of hypoxic waters . Monitoring by USGS in the National Water Quality Assessment Program found that the highest concentrations of nitrogen in streams occurred in agricultural basins, and were correlated with nitrogen inputs from fertilizers and manure (USGS, 1999). An analysis of fecal coliform bacteria in streams found that concentrations were partly a function of the number of both confined and unconfined animals in a watershed (Smith et al., 2005). The impact of gases and odor from animal feeding operations on human health or the environment has been difficult to determine because data on emissions are generally lacking (Jacobson et al., 1999). Animal waste in the United States has been estimated to contribute about 80 percent of all anthropogenic ammonia emissions, 25 percent of nitrous oxide emissions, and 18 percent of methane emissions (Battye et al., 1994;van Aardenne et al., 2001)."}, {"section_title": "Water-Air Interactions", "text": "Emissions to water and to the atmosphere are not independent events, but are linked by the biological and chemical processes that produce the various compounds.

Reducing nitrogen movement along one pathway by changing its form will increase nitrogen movement along a different path ( fig. 4.5.5).

Diet manipulation-Feed additives and more efficient nutrient utilization in animals can reduce the amount of nitrogen and phosphorus in manure. This helps reduce the odor and ammonia emissions from production houses, and simplifies manure management for protecting water quality at all stages of handling and disposal.  Chemical additive-Different chemicals can be added to manure during collection in order to bind nutrients, thus reducing odorous compounds and ammonia emissions. By reducing atmospheric emissions, the nitrogen content of manure increases, increasing its value as a fertilizer. But the higher nitrogen content can also increase the cost of applying manure at agronomic rates to protect water quality. Air treatment-Trapping air vented from production houses and treating it before discharge to the atmosphere can reduce odorous compounds, ammonia, and other gases. Tank and lagoon cover-Covering storage tanks and lagoons can greatly reduce the discharge of ammonia and other gases. Conserving nitrogen in tank and lagoon waste increases the value of the effluent as a fertilizer, but can increase the cost of managing manure to protect water quality. Solid-liquid separation-Separating urea from solid fecal matter using sedimentation basins or mechanical methods avoids some of the reactions that cause the formation of ammonia and odor. Separation also reduces the cost of moving waste to land for efficient disposal. Manure incorporation/injection-Rapidly incorporating manure into the soil after spreading by plowing or disking-or injecting manure liquids or slurries directly into the soil-reduces odor, ammonia emissions, and the potential for runoff to surface waters. However, incorporation/injection may also increase the risk of nitrogen leaching to ground water. Comprehensive nutrient management-Nutrient management matches the combined nutrient applications from manure and commercial nutrient sources to crop needs so that as few nutrients as possible are lost to the environment.

Concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs, defined as those operations requiring a pollution discharge permit) develop and implement a nutrient management plan that bases nutrient applications on agronomic rates. This provision requires CAFOs to spread their manure over a much larger land base than they are currently using, and most will need to move their manure off farm.

The National Research Council in A New Era for Irrigation (NRC, 1996) highlights the importance of IWM \"to allocate limited water resources equitably.\" Improved IWM can help reduce loadings of nutrients, pesticides, and trace elements in irrigation runoff to surface waters, and leaching of agrichemicals into groundwater supplies (Schaible and Aillery, 2003).

However, larger farms irrigate many more acres, so aggregate water savings due to a conservation program could be much greater for these farms. While \"perceived economic benefits\" and \"lack of financing ability\" are two commonly reported barriers to irrigation system improvements across all irrigated farms, \"not investigating the merits of system improvements\" is an additional critical barrier to system improvements for smaller irrigated farms."}, {"section_title": "Producers' Incentives", "text": "While survey results demonstrate that irrigators do implement irrigation system improvements to meet environmental goals, improved farm returns is likely the dominant motivating factor (table 4.6.3). From a private economic perspective, producers generally invest in improved irrigation technologies when perceived benefits are greater than additional (net) producer costs. However, Kim et al. (2000) demonstrate that from a public perspective where water quality benefits accrue largely off-farm, public cost-share funding of a more conserving technology may be warranted. For example, in Merrick County, NE, adoption of tailwater recovery or surge-flow gravity systems may be more profitable to the producer although, even with these systems, groundwater quality would continue to deteriorate. A center-pivot sprinkler system would significantly reduce the accumulation of nitrates in ground water after 15 years. However, adoption of center-pivot systems would reduce producer profits by about $9 per acre (in 1990 dollars), so cost-sharing or other incentives might be necessary to encourage adoption of systems that contribute more to improving water quality.  Federal, State, and local cost-share programs that address farm water delivery, field-level irrigation systems, and farm water management practices are key to improving irrigation efficiency. Only about 13 percent of irrigated farms in the West participated in public cost-share programs for water conservation between 1994 and 1998. Smaller irrigated farms make up 77 percent of participants in USDA cost-share programs designed to encourage irrigation or drainage improvements. Given that such farms account for only 34 percent of farm water applied in the West, these results indicate that farm size matters in the effectiveness of current agricultural water-conservation programs. Cost-share programs that target larger farms would likely conserve more water, making more water available to meet environmental and other objectives, especially when integrated with Statesponsored water markets, water banks, and conserved-water-rights programs (Schaible, 2004b "}, {"section_title": "Information Technologies for Farm Management Decisions", "text": "IT adoption by U.S. farms has exhibited significant growth over the last several years; as of 2003, about half of all farms had computer and/or Internet access ( fig. 4.7.1). However, only about 30 percent of the farms reported using a computer for the farm business. Internet access grew from less than 15 percent of all farms in 1997 to 48 percent in 2003, and 5 percent of all producers reported using the Internet to contact a USDA website."}, {"section_title": "Farm IT Users and Uses", "text": "Periodically, information on computer and Internet use is collected in the Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS). The 1999 ARMS measured the extent of farmers' Internet use and online purchases/sales of farm products. Many agricultural e-commerce ventures were just getting started in 1999, so this was a first look at how farm businesses were using IT. Farms that bought or sold online in 1999 were more likely to be run by younger, more educated operators than the national average. Almost threequarters of active e-commerce users were between 35 and 54 years old, and just over a third had completed college or graduate school. Higher rates of adoption among these groups are to be expected, since the willingness to adopt new technologies is often related to both age and education. Over 42 percent of farmers' online market activity in 1999 involved purchasing crop inputs (e.g., seed, fertilizers, and pesticides), and online buying was related to farm size. In contrast, farm size showed no relation to online purchasing of livestock inputs (e.g., feed and feeders) and selling of livestock (58 percent of farmers' online market activity). The 2000 ARMS was extended to examine the types of activities that were conducted online. During 2000, producers reported $665 million in online buying and selling. Online purchases totaled $378 million, covering machinery and equipment, farm supplies, crop inputs, livestock inputs, and office and computer equipment. Purchases of crop and livestock inputs together were 35 percent of total online purchases, and each was smaller than machinery and equipment purchases and general farm supply purchases. Online sales by farmers totaled $287 million-$191 million in livestock sales and $96 million in crop sales. Farmers reported using the Internet for various management activities. The most common use was price tracking, reported by 82 percent of Internet users. Information gathering from government and other sources was also relatively common. Communication with other farmers and advisory services was reported by about 30 percent of Internet users. The least often reported Internet activity was the management of business finances such as online banking, paying bills, and obtaining loans.

Precision agriculture or site-specific crop management are the terms often applied to the suite of information technologies used for sensing subfield spatial and temporal variability and customizing applications across the field. A number of spatially oriented information technologies are commercially available for most crops to help with fertilizer, pesticide, seed, irrigation, and tillage decisions. Rather than treat fields uniformly, producers can use these technologies to manage soil, pest, landscape, or microclimate variability by adjusting input use within a field to enhance returns and to reduce potential environmental risks. Such technologies include yield monitors; the Global Positioning System (GPS); Geographic Information Systems (GIS); guidance systems; satellite, aerial, and on-the-go sensors; and variable-rate applicators"}, {"section_title": "Adoption Trends", "text": "Based on annual USDA-ARMS surveys of corn, soybean, wheat, and cotton producers, the adoption of precision agriculture (PA) technologies varied widely across these major crops between 1996 and 2003 (table 4.7.1). Yield monitors are the most widely used PA technology, reaching over 35 percent of all corn acres (2001) and nearly 30 percent of all soybean acres (2002). This technology became commercially available to grain producers in the early 1990s, but did not become available to cotton growers until the late 1990s. Only about a third of the corn and soybean acres on which yield monitors were used were connected to the GPS and generated a yield map-an indication that  producers have been cautious about using this technology for changing production practices. Remote sensing, variable-rate applicators, and guidance systems are among the most recent, as well as most rapidly evolving, precision agriculture technologies. Geo-referenced soil data, such as pH or nitrate levels and soil type, can also help producers intensely manage their crops. Recent ARMS data indicate that the adoption of these technologies, like yield monitors and mapping, differs by crop. Remote sensing, either by airplane or satellite, was reportedly used on less than 10 percent of planted acreage in recent years. While remote sensing can detect variation in vegetative reflection, the cause of that variation may still require confirmation on the ground. Also, cost, timeliness, and image resolution issues may be inhibiting the spread of this technology. Machine guidance systems, which are connected to GPS, were introduced in the late 1990s and producers reported using these systems on 6-7 percent of corn and soybean acres during 2001-02, and on over 10 percent of cotton, barley and sorghum acres during 2003. Such systems can reduce costs associated with equipment skips and overlap; permit operation in dust, fog, and darkness; help manage soil compaction; and reduce driver fatigue. Variable-rate technologies (VRT) allow the application of inputs at different rates based on agronomic (or economic) factors that vary within a field. Variable rate application of fertilizer on corn and soybeans was the most widely reported use of this technology (table 4.7.2). Producers reported using VRT to apply inputs on less than 5 percent of planted wheat and cotton acres. Producers of high-value crops (i.e., sugarbeets and potatoes) tend to use precision agriculture-particularly variable rate fertilizer application-on a higher share of crop acreage than field crop producers (  use of geo-referenced soil maps and remote sensing in 2000; this is related to the importance of nitrogen management in sugarbeet profitability ."}, {"section_title": "Factors Influencing Adoption", "text": "A number of factors-such as profitability, farm and farm operator characteristics, university research and extension activities, and government agency use of IT-will likely affect adoption trends in precision agriculture (PA   (2000) reviewed 108 PA studies and found 63 percent of the studies indicated positive net returns for a given PA technology, 11 percent reported negative returns, and 26 percent indicated mixed results. Much of the current research indicates that larger farms, located in the Corn Belt and operated by producers familiar with computers, have a higher probability of adopting precision agriculture technologies than farms without such characteristics (Daberkow and McBride, 2000). Numerous land-grant universities have established PA research and extension programs geared toward adapting IT for crop and livestock production and reducing agriculture's impact on the environment. Universities in Arizona, Mississippi, and Utah are participating in NASA's Space Grant Extension Specialist in Geospatial Technology pilot program to explore how to meet the needs of farmers, ranchers, planners, and others involved in agriculture, natural resource management, and rural development. Similar in scope is the Upper Midwest Aerospace Consortium (UMAC), consisting of participants from North and South Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, and Idaho. USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service and Farm Service Agency are beginning to offer geo-referenced, field-level data specifying soil types and field boundaries, some of which can be accessed over the Internet. Many farmers can also obtain commodity and conservation program information via the Internet."}, {"section_title": "Federal IT Policies for Agriculture and Rural Areas", "text": "Several Federal policies may facilitate the development and adoption of PA technologies and IT-related services. For example, the Conservation Security Program is a voluntary program that provides incentive payments to farmers to implement or maintain conservation practices on working lands (see Chapter 5.4, \"Working-Land Conservation Programs\"). Such practices include the use of yield monitors, a stewardship practice that addresses water quality concerns (Federal Register, 2005). As communication and information service becomes increasingly important, rural or farm communities lacking such services may be economically disadvantaged. Federal programs addressing these issues are discussed in the \"Rural Telecommunication\" briefing room on the ERS website."}, {"section_title": "Production Management Systems", "text": "Production system choices may be motivated by a desire to increase profits, respond to social objectives, or maintain a way of life for future generations. These potentially competing goals are reflected in the choices and amounts of inputs used for production. Agricultural production management deals with how farmers combine land, water, machinery, structures, commercial inputs, labor, and management skills to produce crop and livestock commodities. Management systems embody some of the more important decisions related to production, and include nutrient management, soil management, water management, weed management, and the like. The overall production management system can be thought of as the combination of activities chosen for each aspect of production."}, {"section_title": "Management Systems for Major Field Crops", "text": "Production management for major field crops can be divided into different stages and/or technology suites, among them: Soil management systems (see Chapter 4.2).

Tillage-Deciding how best to prepare the soil for planting while preserving soil, moisture, and nutrients. tors are to manage their production activities to include social objectives, State and Federal communications about recommended conservation practices are critical. U.S. farmers increasingly face both economic and social pressures to adapt management practices to meet conservation goals. For example, the 2002 Farm Security and Rural Investment Act expanded the eligibility and choices for farmers to receive incentive payments for using environmentally sound practices. The Conservation Security Program (CSP), established in the 2002 Act, rewards environmental stewardship practices in nutrient, pest, soil, and water management (see Chapter 5.4, \"Working-Land Conservation Practices\"). Farms that adopt more of the recommended practices under CSP or the Environmental Quality Improvement Program (EQIP) differ from less intensive adopters, and achieve different economic/environmental results. The Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) includes several questions on the adoption of recommended conservation practices. Farmers were grouped by their combined score on representative practices in five aspects of production management (see box, \"Index of Recommended Practices\"). ARMS data for 1998 wheat, 2001 corn, 2002 soybeans, and 2003 cotton were used to compare high and low adopters of recommended practices on the fields used to produce these crops. Adoption ranges from only 3 percent of wheat acreage using variable-rate technology to 92 percent of cotton acreage being scouted for pests (table 4.8.1). (This is primarily a reflection of differences in both economic returns from these practices and in conservation needs, and should not be interpreted as an indicator of differences in conservation effort or commitment.) The number of recommended practices used per acre ranges from an average of 1.8 for cotton to 2.4 for soybeans. There is a strong economic incentive to rotate crops for soybeans (84 percent rotated) and corn (80 percent). Farmers who rotate wheat crops tend to fallow their fields for a year in dryer regions, and double-crop, observing a corn-wheat-soy rotation, in warmer regions. Scouting for pests was the most common recommended practice used for wheat (83 percent) and cotton (92 percent). Pest control accounts for a larger proportion of cotton production costs compared with other crops, and scouting helps minimize pest control costs. Agricultural Resources and Environmental Indicators, 2006 Edition / EIB-16 Economic Research Service/USDA For each crop, an index was constructed based on the following practices recommended as contributing to conservation objectives. The total score could range from 0 (adopted none of the practices) to 5 (adopted all of the practices), where 1= used recommended production practice, and 0= did not use recommended production practice. Rotation-Zero indicates the same crop was planted for 2 consecutive years. All other rotation schemes are scored one. Under this definition, idling or fallowing land during the previous spring and summer counts as rotation. Double cropping is not counted as a rotation if the current crop is the same as the crop planted 1 year prior. Tillage-One indicates producer used conservation tillage (30 percent or greater residue remaining). Conservation tillage includes notill, mulch-till, and ridge-till systems. Scouting for pests-One indicates producer scouted crop for any pests, including weeds, insects, or disease. Casual scouting while in the field for other purposes is counted. Testing for nutrient requirements-One indicates a soil test for nitrogen or phosphorus was performed, or that a plant tissue test was performed. Use of variable-rate technology-One indicates that a variable-rate technology was used for applying fertilizer, lime, seeds, or pesticides. Yield, soil, or pest mapping without use of a variable-rate technology is not counted.

For each of the four crops, more than 80 percent of the acreage received one to three of the five recommended practices and less than 6 percent received none ( fig. 4.8.1)."}, {"section_title": "Role of Government Programs", "text": "Corn and soybean producers who participate in government agricultural programs adopt more of the recommended production practices than producers who do not participate. In 2001, corn producers who received program payments used, on average, almost twice as many of the recommended practices as producers not receiving payments. Conversely, operators who adopted one or more of the practices were much more likely (82 percent) to receive government payments than nonadopters (57 percent). Factors other than program participation influence adoption of recommended practices. Large farms adopt more recommended practices (and are also more likely to participate in programs). Also, any producer with cropland that contains a wetland or is highly erodible, as defined by the Natural Resources Conservation Service, must use an approved conservation system on that land to receive government payments (see Chapter 5.3, \"Compliance Provisions for Soil and Water Conservation\"). They may also benefit from adopting recommended practices, regardless of program requirements, through reduced costs. ARMS data show that farms with wetland or highly erodible land (HEL) adopt more of the recommended practices, and are also more likely to participate in programs. The increased likelihood of wetland or HEL among program participants could explain part of the higher adoption rates for program participants. Other factors that affect both adoption of approved practices and participation in programs include livestock production, age, education, primary occupation, off-farm occupation, and business structure (see Lambert et al., 2006). Each could explain a part of the higher adoption rates for program participants."}, {"section_title": "Farm and Operator Characteristics", "text": "Farms that plant more acreage also use more recommended practices than farms that do not. Farms that use four or five practices typically plant about four times as much corn and about twice as much wheat or soybeans as farms that use none of the practices (fig. 4.8.2). Producers who used more conservation practices were typically younger ( fig. 4.8.3). Whereas about a third of producers using none of the practices were younger than 50 years old, half of producers that used four or more conservation practices were under 50. Younger producers have longer time horizons for receiving the benefits from conservation practices and are more likely than older producers to make an investment for a long-term payoff. No-till and variable-rate technologies, for example, require large capital investments. Younger producers also have more of an incentive to rotate their crops to keep their field productive since they are more likely to be using the field for many years. Producers using more conservation practices are also more likely to operate farms as partnerships or as family corporations rather than sole ownerships ( fig. 4.8.3). Full-time operators of larger, more complex enterprises may be more likely to have the necessary skills to optimize implementation of newer conservation practices. They also can spread the costs of obtaining information over a larger operation. Producers in partnerships and family corporations may have multiple managers to split the farm management workload, allowing greater depth of knowledge and experience about farm practices. Partnerships and corporations are also more likely to have management successors, giving them a longer time horizon.  Cotton, 2003Wheat, 1998Soybeans, 2002 Number of production practices * Producers who adopt more recommended practices are more educated, on average ( fig. 4.8.4). A higher percentage of corn, soybean, and wheat producers who adopted four or more conservation practices completed some college, compared with producers who adopted none. Increased schooling may help producers handle complex farming operations by improving the operator's ability to assimilate new information. Education may also help a producer understand and adapt to changing technologies and recommendations. Producers who adopt more practices are more likely to be full-time farmers listing farming as their principal occupation. Full-time producers are less likely to have nonfarm jobs that compete for their time or provide alternate sources of income. Producers more dependent on farming for income are likely more motivated to explore every possibility to reduce the risk of crop failure or yield reductions. Hence, full-time producers may be more likely to scout their fields for pests, conduct nutrient tests, and stay abreast of the long-term benefits of using conservation practices."}, {"section_title": "Indicators of Conservation Performance", "text": "According to ARMS, farmers who adopt more recommended practices generally perform better on conservation objectives. One such objective is to minimize spillover loss of nutrients into the environment. In practical terms, that means reducing the application of nutrients to just what is needed by the crop. A higher ratio of nutrient applied per bushel of grain or bale of cotton lint indicates a higher potential for nutrient contamination of surface and ground waters. ARMS data show that farms using more recommended practices generally apply less total nutrients per unit of product. This is especially true for wheat ( fig. 4.8.5). High adopters also apply less phosphate on soybeans and less potash on corn.

Under organic farming systems, the fundamental components and natural processes of ecosystems-such as soil organism activities, nutrient cycling, and species distribution and competition-are used as farm management tools. For example, crops are rotated, food and shelter are provided for the predators and parasites of crop pests, animal manure and crop residues are cycled, and planting/harvesting dates are carefully timed. Organic livestock production systems attempt to accommodate an animal's natural nutritional and behavioral requirements, ensuring that dairy cows and other ruminants, for example, have access to pasture. The 2002 USDA livestock standards incorporate requirements for living conditions, pasture and access to the outdoors, feed ration, and health care practices suitable to the needs of the particular species. The national organic standards address the methods, practices, and substances used in producing and handling crops, livestock, and processed agricultural products. Although specific practices and materials used by organic operations may vary, the standards require every aspect of organic production and handling to comply with the provisions of the Organic Foods Production Act of 1990. Organically produced food cannot be produced using genetic engineering, sewage sludge, or irradiation. These standards include a national list of approved synthetic substances (such as insecticidal soaps and horticultural oils), and prohibited nonsynthetic substances (such as arsenic, strychnine, and tobacco dust) for use in organic production and handling.

U.S. certified organic crop acreage more than doubled between 1992 and 1997, and doubled again between 1997 and 2003 for many crops. Organic fruit and vegetable crop acreage, along with acreage used for hay and silage crops, expanded steadily between 1997 and 2003. However, most of the acreage increase for organic grain and oilseed crops took place early in this period ( fig. 4.9.1), and organic soybean acreage has declined substantially since 2001.  U.S. cropland in 2001, the share is much higher in some crops, such as fruits (over 2 percent), and vegetables (over 4 percent). California was the leading State in certified organic cropland in 2003, with nearly 180,000 acres, mostly used for fruit and vegetable production. North Dakota followed with nearly 130,000 acres of cropland, mostly for wheat, soybeans, and other field crops. Minnesota, Montana, Colorado, and Iowa were other top States. Nearly 40 States had certified pasture and rangeland in 2003, most with under 20,000 acres, although several States had over 100,000 acres and Texas had over 250,000 acres. The number of certified organic beef cows, milk cows, hogs, pigs, sheep, and lambs was up more than five-fold since 1997, and up 15 percent between 2002 and 2003. Dairy has been one of the fastest growing segments of the organic foods industry during this period, and milk cows accounted for over half of the certified livestock animals. Poultry animals raised under certified organic management-including layer hens, broilers, and turkeys-showed even higher levels of growth during 1997-2003. California had more certified operations than any other State, with just over 1,900 operations in 2003, up 28 percent from the previous year ( fig. 4.9.2). Wisconsin, Washington, Iowa, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Vermont, Oregon, and Maine rounded out the top 10. Many of these States have a high proportion of farms with fruits and vegetables and other specialty crops. Also, some of these States, particularly in the Northeast, have relatively little cropland but a large concentration of market gardeners. Although consumer demand for organic foods is expected to continue growing rapidly in the United States and other major markets, the competition for these markets is likely to increase considerably. Since 2002, USDA has accredited over 40 organizations in foreign countries, as well as approximately 50 groups in the United States, to certify producers and handlers. USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service estimates that the value of U.S. organic exports in 2002 was between $125 million and $250 million, while the value of U.S. organic imports was between $1.0 and $1.5 billion (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2005). Cotton and soybeans are among the U.S. organic crops that have declined since 2001, despite the growth in retail sales of cotton and soy-based products. Import competition has likely played a role in the decline."}, {"section_title": "Economic Characteristics of Organic Systems", "text": "The rapid increase in organic crop and livestock production reflects the increase in consumer demand for organically produced food-20 percent or more per year throughout the 1990s. According to industry data, retail sales of organic food reached $10.4 billion in 2003, up 20.4 percent from the previous year, and accounting for nearly 2 percent of U.S. food sales. Farmgate and retail price data, collected by private groups, have indicated substantial organic premiums for fruits, vegetables, and milk over the last decade, and recent government data show similar premiums at the wholesale level. Organic grain and soybean crops also enjoyed substantial price premiums during the 1990s, exceeding 50 percent for corn, soybeans, wheat, and oats during 1993-99, and continue to carry a substantial premium (Streff and Dobbs, 2004). A number of studies have been conducted on the motivations of consumers who purchase organic foods, such as perceived health attributes and concern about pesticide residues and the environment (Dimitri and Greene, 2002). Potential benefits from organic farming systems include improved soil tilth and productivity, lower energy use, and reduced use of pesticides (USDA, 1980;Smolik et al., 1993), and researchers are beginning to compare differences in the nutritive value of the foods produced from these systems as well (Gold, 2000). A growing number of studies in the United States have examined the yields, input costs, profitability, managerial requirements, and other economic characteristics of organic farming. A 1990 review of the U.S. literature at Cornell concluded that the \"variation within organic and conventional farming systems is likely as large as the differences between the two systems,\" and found mixed results in the comparisons for most characteristics (see Chapter 4.8. for more information on conventional systems). Several USDA and university studies during the 1990s in California, Ohio, and Texas indicated that organic price premiums are necessary to give organic farming systems comparable or higher whole-farm profits than conventional systems, particularly for crops like processed tomatoes and cotton. A Henry A. ative studies in the 1980s and early 1990s on Midwestern organic grain and soybean production found organic systems needed price premiums to be more profitable than conventional systems (Welsh, 1999). Several of these studies, however, found that organic grain and soybean production could be as profitable even without price premiums due to higher yields in drier areas or periods, lower input costs, or higher revenue from the mix of crops used in the system. Other recent studies have also found that some organic systems may be more profitable than conventional systems, even without price premiums (Swezey et al., 1994, Reganold et al., 2001). Net returns to both conventional and organic production systems vary with factors such as soil type, climate, and proximity to markets, and help explain the wide variation in economic performance within each system. Factors not captured in standard profit calculations-such as convenience, longer-term planning horizons, and environmental ethics-can motivate rational adoption of a particular practice or farming system. Our understanding of the factors influencing net returns to organic farming systems remains imperfect. Economic research on organic farming has tended to focus narrowly on profitability (Fox et al., 1991), but land-grant universities and others are increasingly examining the long-term economics of organic systems through replicated field trial research and a multidisciplinary systems approach (table 4.9.2). According to the Organic Farming Research Foundation, 18 States had landgrant institutions with research acres under certified organic management in 2003, up from 6 States in 2001. Organic farming systems trials-in experiment stations and onfarm settings-seek to answer basic research questions about yields, profitability, and environmental impacts, as well as to address farmer-defined management and production obstacles to adoption of organic production systems. USDA's national standards do not restrict additional eco-labeling of organic products, and some organic certifiers are developing standards on social aspects of agricultural production and food distribution-such as fair trade and local sourcing. The Florida Certified Organic Growers and Consumers organization, for example, recently developed a partnership program for food retailers and restaurants in North Florida to certify their level of commitment to local food sourcing (FOG/QCS, 2003). Most coffee sold in the United States that is certified as fair trade (indicating that farmers receive a fair price) also has a separate organic certification. Some certification groups are trying to improve the efficiency of their efforts by integrating these programs."}, {"section_title": "Federal Policy Initiatives", "text": "Government research and policy initiatives often play a key role in the adoption of new farming technologies and systems. Worldwide, adoption levels for organic farming systems are currently the highest in European Union countries. Governments there have been developing consumer education initiatives and providing direct financial support to producers for conversion since the late 1980s to capture environmental benefits and support rural development. State and Federal support for organic farmers and handlers is also beginning to emerge in the United States. Minnesota and Iowa, for example, began subsidizing conversion to organic farming systems in the late 1990s as a way to capture the environmental benefits of these systems. In 2003, the National Association of State Departments of Agriculture released a policy statement on organic agriculture expressing support for a wide range of activities that would expand public-sector organic research and education and provide technical assistance to organic and transitional farmers. Research and Technical Assistance. The 2002 Farm Act contains an Organic Agriculture Research and Extension Initiative that authorizes $3 million per year in new mandatory appropriations in fiscal years 2003-07. These funds are being used to administer competitive research grants focused on organic agriculture production, breeding, and processing methods, as well as the marketing and policy constraints. Conservation Initiatives. The 2002 Farm Act provided funding for the Conservation Security Program, which provides payments to producers for adopting or maintaining land management and conservation practices to address resource concerns. This new program may interest organic farmers who commonly adopt these types of practices as part of their organic farming systems. (See Chapter 5.1 for a general discussion of Federal conservation initiatives and Chapter 5.4 for a discussion of working-land programs.) Exemptions From Marketing Assessments. Another provision in the 2002 Farm Act specifies that certified organic producers who produce and market only organic products and do not produce any conventional or nonorganic products will now be exempt from paying an assessment under any commodity promotion law. In December 2003, USDA published a proposed rule to exempt producers from paying assessments associated with its marketing order programs, and in January 2005 a similar proposed rule was published to cover exemptions for its research and promotion programs.  By 2007-if authorized levels are realized-conservation funding will be double the level under the previous farm bill (1996)(1997)(1998)(1999)(2000)(2001), with about twothirds of the new funds going to programs emphasizing conservation on working lands.

These approaches can avoid the inherent difficulties in regulating nonpoint sources of pollution and can minimize economic harm to farmers by educating them and providing them with incentives to willingly improve production practices. In passing the 2002 Farm Act, Congress reaffirmed a preference for addressing natural resource problems on private land through a consolidated set of financial assistance programs supported by research and education. In a notable exception, Conservation Compliance (see Chapter 5.3, \"Compliance Provisions for Soil and Water Conservation\"), which requires wetland conservation and soil conservation on highly erodible cropland for producers receiving Federal farm program payments, was continued. USDA programs now, more than ever before, offer producers a range of options for assistance with conservation efforts, among them (see table 5.1.2): Land retirement programs generally remove land from agricultural production for a long period (at least 10 years) or, in some cases, permanently. Working-land programs provide technical and financial assistance to farmers who install or maintain conservation practices on land in production. Agricultural land preservation programs purchase rights to certain land uses, such as development, in order to maintain land in agricultural use. USDA provides, through Conservation Technical Assistance, ongoing technical assistance to agricultural producers who seek to improve the environmental performance of their farms. This \"portfolio\" approach to conservation policy provides the flexibility needed to address agri-environmental issues. Most producers-regardless of their agri-environmental problems, resource settings, and the size and management structure of their operation-have options for receiving Federal assistance for conservation. Smaller operations-those with sales of less than $250,000 per yearproduce roughly one-third of U.S. agricultural output but include nearly three-quarters of all producer-owned land. Operators of these farms often receive a larger share of their household income from land retirement payments and nonfarm sources than from the sale of agricultural products. Larger farms, on the other hand, produce two-thirds of U.S. agricultural output while accounting for only one-fourth of the land. These farms are generally more commercially oriented and their operators receive most of their household income from farm sources. The 2002 Act's increased funding for conservation on working lands, along with a greater focus on livestock operations and relaxation of conservation payment limitations, is expected to raise conservation participation by larger farms."}, {"section_title": "Expanding Conservation on Working Lands", "text": "Authorized funding for the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), the major working lands program (see Chapter 5.4, \"Working-Land Conservation Programs\"), jumped five-fold with the 2002 Farm Act, approaching $5.8 billion for 2002-07. Of the $3.3 billion authorized for FY2002-2005, $3 billion (91 percent) has been made available. Through EQIP, crop and livestock producers can get information and technical/financial assistance in designing and implementing conservation practices (structural or land management) on their land. In response to new (2003) Clean Water Act regulations on animal feeding operations, EQIP now provides more incentives for livestock producers to participate. At least 60 percent of the program's funding is targeted for livestock producers, up from 50 percent in the 1996 Farm Act. Limits on the size of participating livestock operations have been removed, and maximum payment levels per year have been increased. EQIP will also put greater emphasis on water conservation. A new, separate fund for ground-and surface-water conservation activities was established within EQIP, as well as a special fund for water conservation in the Klamath Basin in California and Oregon. The 2002 Farm Act also authorized a new working-land program: the Conservation Security Program (CSP). Like EQIP, CSP encourages producers to address resource concerns such as soil quality, water quality, or wildlife habitat on working land. The differences in these two programs, however, are greater than the similarities. Unlike other conservation programs, CSP was approved as an entitlement program, meaning that eligible producers who meet program requirements can be enrolled at the producers' option, as in ongoing commodity programs. Before CSP was implemented, however, Congress limited CSP funding, making limitations on enrollment necessary. For FY 2004, $41 million was available for CSP, and $202 million more was available in FY 2005. Unlike EQIP, CSP requires a substantial level of environmental stewardship before producers become eligible for enrollment. Soil quality and water quality must be addressed (to standards set by USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS)) before land can be enrolled in CSP. CSP rewards these and other past conservation efforts through stewardship payments. CSP also encourages whole-farm conservation by offering higher stewardship payments to producers who undertake farmwide conservation. CSP also funds \"enhancements,\" which are directed, in part, toward encouraging producers to go beyond basic conservation effort encouraged by more traditional programs like EQIP (e.g., to reduce erosion below the soil loss tolerance-the traditional standard for soil erosion control). While many livestockrelated practices can be eligible for CSP, the focus is on land-based practices; livestock waste management structures and handling equipment are specifically excluded. Finally, CSP is a national program, but is available only in selected watersheds for any given signup. Part of the NRCS strategy is to make all 2,119 U.S. watersheds eligible for enrollment at least once over an 8-year period. The Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program (WHIP) provides cost-sharing to landowners and producers to develop and improve wildlife habitat. WHIP funding rose from just over $62 million during 1996to $360 million over FY 2002-07. For FY 2002, WHIP has received funding of $129 million, 68 percent of the $190 million authorized for that period. Accompanying the large increase in working-land program funding was a more subtle change in the way funds are awarded through these programs-changes that may reduce environmental cost effectiveness. In EQIP, for example, the 2002 Farm Act eliminated the use of conservation priority areas, which focused the program's effort in areas of highest environmental need. The Act also eliminated \"bidding down,\" which allowed producers to increase their chance of enrollment by offering to take a smaller payment, reducing the cost of contracts and thereby stretching the program budget. For contract offers with comparable environmental values, the Secretary of Agriculture cannot assign higher priority to an application based only on a lower bid from the operator. NRCS may consider costs in ranking potential participants, even though bidding down is no longer allowed. While the expansion of conservation on working lands offers significant benefits, implementing it may pose additional challenges. Payments for a broad range of conservation practices on working land are now available to a wider range of producers than ever before, expanding the importance of both conservation planning and monitoring of practice implementation and maintenance. This is particularly true for some conservation management practices, such as crop nutrient management, which are less visible and thus more difficult to monitor than changes in tillage or contour cropping. Multiple conservation programs for working lands could also make it more difficult for programs to work together seamlessly and avoid duplication. Producers participating in new and newly expanded conservation programs will need conservation planning services and technical assistance. To help handle the increased workload, the 2002 Farm Security and Rural Investment (FSRI) Act included funding for certification of third-party technical service providers to supplement NRCS field staff.

The program uses contracts with agricultural producers and landowners to retire highly erodible and environmentally sensitive cropland and pasture from production for 10-15 years. Enrolled land is planted to grasses, trees, and other cover, thereby reducing erosion and water pollution and providing other environmental benefits (as well as reducing the supply of agricultural commodities). Enrollment in CRP increased rapidly once the program got underway (fig. 5.2.1), with nearly all eligible applicants accepted. Approximately 34 million acres were enrolled during the first 9 signups (between 1986 and 1989). 1 In these early years, CRP eligibility was limited to about 100 million acres of land with highly erodible soils, with per-acre payments based on a regional average of cropland rental rates (along with half the cost of establishing permanent cover). 2 The CRP was not the first farmland retirement program operated by the Federal Government, nor was it the only land diversion program operating 1 Although the original (1985) legislation envisioned the program retiring 40-45 million acres, enrollment authority was capped at 38 million acres in 1992 and reduced to 36.4 million acres in 1996. In 2002, CRP's enrollment authority was increased to 39.2 million acres. 2 The amount of land enrolled in CRP does not necessarily reflect the amount of land removed from production. First, \"slippage,\" the reallocation of lands outside the program (such as pastureland) to cropland uses, may occur. Wu (2000) argues that about 21 acres have been brought into crop production for every 100 retired through CRP. However, more recent studies using the same data have found no evidence of slippage in the CRP (Roberts and Bucholtz, 2004). Second, land enrolled in CRP might have left production even without the program. Lubowski et al. (2003)  However, these earlier land diversion programs focused on supply control and did not require environmental/habitat management. The primary goal of the CRP in the years immediately following its creation was to reduce soil erosion on highly erodible cropland (Osborn and Heimlich, 1994). 3 The Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 expanded eligibility for CRP beyond highly erodible land. The 240 million acres of eligible land included several \"Conservation Priority Areas\" (the Chesapeake Bay, Long Island Sound, and Great Lakes watersheds), State water quality priority areas, and smaller plots of land adopting high-priority conservation practices (Barbarika, 2001). USDA also made two significant changes to program enrollment criteria: To account for multiple environmental concerns, an environmental benefits index (EBI) was used to rank offers. The EBI weights a number of different concerns, including water quality, air quality, and soil erodibility (table 5.2.1). Maximum allowable rental rates were based on a soil-specific estimate of the rent earned on comparable local cropland. Use of soilspecific maximum rental rates enabled USDA to enroll environmentally sensitive, but highly productive, land into the program. Following passage of the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996, wildlife habitat was added to the EBI. A continuous signup was initiated for acreage devoted to specific conservation practices, such as filter strips, riparian buffers, grassed waterways, field windbreaks, shelterbelts, 3 It has been argued that, given the financial crisis facing the farm sector in the mid-1980s, curbing farm production and supporting income of CRP participants were equally important program goals (Dicks, 1987). living snow fences, salt-tolerant vegetation, shallow water areas for wildlife, and wellhead protection. In 1997, continuous signups were augmented by the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP), a Federal-State partnership designed to encourage farm conservation practices that meet specific State and national conservation and environmental objectives. With early contracts expiring, signups conducted in 1997 and 1998 enrolled over 22 million acres. Unlike the early signups, competition was keen, with all bids ranked using the EBI. Since the bid process meant that already enrolled lands were not automatically re-enrolled, the distribution of CRP enrollment shifted somewhat during the 1990s. Of the nearly 34 million acres enrolled in 2002, 17 percent represented net additions to county CRP acreage (over the county's 1990 enrollment). And of the nearly 33 million acres enrolled in 1990, 14 percent was dropped from the program by 2002. Although a roughly equal number of counties gained and lost CRP acreage between 1990 and 2002, there was little redistribution of acreage at the regional level (Sullivan et al., 2004). The Northern Great Plains gained slightly, at the expense of the Heartland (probably due to the lower rental rates requested by Plains bidders) and the Southern Seaboard (where many CRP acres planted in trees were not offered for re-enrollment). Overall, the CRP started as a program with a soil conservation agenda, in a time when the farm sector was weathering a severe economic downturn. As other stakeholders recognized the potential of this dedicated stream of conservation expenditures, CRP evolved beyond soil conservation, with greater weight given to wildlife habitat, air and water quality, and carbon sequestration.

Most importantly, in the earlier years a \"walk away\" strategy was often used: parcels were allowed to return to their wetland condition with no other intervention. However, this strategy led to poor wetland function. So, a \"full restoration\" strategy was adopted in the late 1990s.

Any change in land use, investment (e.g., new machinery), or production practices (e.g., reduced tillage) involves both benefits and costs. Likewise, producers who decide to meet compliance requirements are likely to do so because the benefits of compliance outweigh the costs."}, {"section_title": "Farm Program Benefits and Compliance", "text": "Farm program benefits subject to compliance-including farm commodity, disaster, and conservation programs-ranged from $8 billion to $27 billion between 1997 and 2004 (fig. 5.3.1). Farmers may also become ineligible for loan and loan guarantee programs that offer reduced interest rates or improved access to credit. Whether these benefits are large enough to leverage conservation depends on whether they exceed the cost of required conservation actions. Because farm program payment levels are set independent of the compliance requirement, there is no guarantee that they will exceed compliance costs. Correlation between payments and conservation needs is critical to the (environmental) success of any compliance requirement, as on highly erodible cropland ( fig. 5.3.2). \u2022 1 dot = 25,000 acres of HEL cropland. T would be very costly on some land-so costly that a considerable amount of HEL cropland would be unprofitable to farm (Canning, 1994). In the meantime, doubts about the scientific validity of T were being voiced (Cook, 1982) and research showed, increasingly, that water quality damage from sedimentation (which is unrelated to T) exceeded the value of productivity loss (see Ribaudo, 1986;Ribaudo et al., 1990). As eventually implemented, producers could meet compliance requirements by designing conservation systems to obtain \"significant\" erosion reduction using \"technically and economically feasible\" practices, rather than reducing erosion to T. In most cases, conservation systems could be based on inexpensive management practices such as conservation cropping, crop residue management, and conservation tillage. More than half of the HEL cropland acres that meet the Conservation Compliance requirement have approved conservation systems made up of these three practices alone or in combination (USDA, 1999). Producers may also incur opportunity costs when they refrain from converting additional HEL or wetland that could have been profitably cropped. With wetlands, the opportunity cost equals the value of the land for crop production, less the cost of drainage and land use conversion (e.g., removing trees). HEL not previously cropped can be converted to crop production if an approved conservation system is applied. Compliance cost equals the lower of (1) the opportunity cost of forgoing agricultural production, or (2) the cost of applying a conservation system. On land not cropped before 1985, however, conservation systems must reduce erosion to the T level-a potentially expensive task."}, {"section_title": "Enforcement", "text": "USDA's major enforcement tool is the annual Compliance Status Review (CSR). Each year, through the CSR, USDA field staff assess HEL and wetland compliance on a sample of \"tracts\" that are identified as part of farms receiving Federal farm program payments subject to compliance provisions. Some tracts are selected at random from the national Farm Service Agency (FSA) database, while others are added by State FSA offices because of potential for noncompliance. For example, tracts on which temporary variances or waivers were previously granted must be checked to establish a return to full compliance. According to the CSR, overall compliance is high. Based on 1997 CSR data, 95.9 percent of producers subject to compliance were actively applying approved conservation systems. In more recent years, the CSR has shown compliance rates of roughly 98 percent. However, a recent GAO report (2003) identified a variety of deficiencies in the CSR, among them the methods used to select the sample for review, consistency, and clarity of guidance provided to local offices, data handling and analysis, failure to cite producers for significant deficiencies, and inadequate justification for waiver of penalties. This suggests that the actual level of compliance-and whether environmental gains have been realized-cannot be clearly understood using CSR data alone."}, {"section_title": "What Have Compliance Mechanisms Accomplished?", "text": "The rate of soil erosion on U.S. cropland and the rate of wetland drainage for agricultural production have dropped significantly in recent decades. Cropland erosion fell from 3.1 billion tons in 1982 to about 1.9 billion tons in 1997, a reduction of 1.2 billion tons or just under 40 percent. Wind erosion declined by 542 million tons per year (40 percent), while water erosion declined by 633 million tons per year (38 percent). The rate of wetland conversion for agriculture has also declined from 235,000 acres per year during 1974-84 (Dahl and Johnson, 1991) to 26,000 acres per year for 1992-97 (USDA-NRCS, 2002) (see Chapter 2.3, \"Wetlands: Status and Trends\"). Although these trends coincide with implementation of compliance mechanisms, the trends alone are insufficient to show compliance's efficacy. Environmental gain can be attributed to compliance mechanisms (or any agrienvironmental program) only to the extent that the incentive prompted a change in producer behavior. In other words, we can attribute wetland conservation or erosion reduction to compliance only if the producer or landowner would have done otherwise in the absence of compliance. Because producers respond to a wide range of market and policy incentives, isolating the effect of compliance mechanisms can be difficult. To disentangle these effects, a careful analysis is required (Claassen et al, 2004)."}, {"section_title": "Has Conservation Compliance Reduced Soil Erosion?", "text": "Between 1982 and 1997, annual soil erosion from cropland dropped by 1.2 billion tons. (Erosion reduction data are from the National Resources Inventory (NRI)). Of this total, million tons occurred on non-HEL landwhere conservation compliance did not apply-leaving 732 million tons ( fig. 5.3.3). Because compliance was formulated to avoid forcing land out of production, erosion reduction due to land use change (365 million tons, including CRP enrollment) was probably not caused by compliance, leaving 367 million tons. Erosion reduction to levels below the soil loss tolerance (T) level (36 million tons) also cannot be attributed to conservation compliance because conservation compliance required-at most-that erosion be reduced to T. Finally, erosion reduction on farms that do not receive government payments (36 million tons) cannot be attributed to compliance, leaving 295 million tons, or 25 percent of the 1.2-billion-ton reduction in cropland soil erosion between 1982 and 1997. Furthermore, some erosion reduction may have occurred even in the absence of a compliance requirement. For example, conservation tillage can preserve soil moisture where rainfall is limited and can also reduce machinery, fuel, and labor costs, making it profitable for some producers regardless of its effect on soil erosion. Tillage and planting machinery needed to practice conservation tillage became widely available only in the mid-to late 1970s. Because widespread adoption of new practices often occurs over a long period of time, producers who included conservation tillage in compliance plans may have eventually adopted the practice for economic reasons even without the compliance requirement. Still, evidence suggests that compliance did have an effect. Reductions in excess erosion (i.e., erosion in excess of T) were larger on farms that received farm program payments than on farms that did not. Excess wind erosion declined by 31 percent on farms receiving payments, but only percent on farms not receiving payments ( fig. 5.3.4 Though wetland conversion for agricultural production has declined over time (see Chapter 2.3), the role of swampbuster is not entirely clear. Swampbuster penalties constrain wetland conversion only when: (1) wetlands are located on farms that participate in Federal programs subject to swampbuster, (2) those wetlands could be profitably converted to crop production in the absence of swampbuster, and (3) other policies (e.g., Section 404 of the Clean Water Act) are not applicable or not effective in deterring wetland conversion. Many wetlands, ostensibly subject to swampbuster, are in remote areas unlikely to be converted to cropland because they cannot be easily incorporated into an existing farm. Of roughly 90 million acres subject to swampbuster, only 12.9 million are adjacent to existing cropland. These wetlands appear to be located in areas that receive large government payments ( fig. 5.3.5). Even so, swampbuster deters conversion only if conversion would otherwise be profitable. On this question, the evidence is mixed. Some researchers have questioned whether wetland conversion for crop production is profitable even without swampbuster (Tolman, 1997;Kramer and Shabman, 1993). Others, using more detailed data on the potential productivity of wetland soils, suggest that there are wetlands that could be profitably converted to crops in the absence of policy constraints. In the absence of swampbuster sanctions, Claassen et al. (2000) estimate that between 1.5 million and 3.3 million acres of wetlands could be profitably converted to crop production under favorable market conditions. Agricultural Resources and Environmental Indicators, 2006 Edition / EIB-16 Economic Research Service/USDA \u2022 1 dot = 25,000 acres of wetlands adjacent to cropland. Finally, swampbuster is just one of a number of policies designed to deter or discourage wetland drainage (see Chapter 5.7 \"Federal Laws Protecting Environmental Quality\"). Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (CWA) gives the Environmental Protection Agency and the Army Corps of Engineers authority to regulate wetland drainage. Since the January 2001 Supreme Court decision in Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County (SWANCC) v. United States Army Corps of Engineers, however, the extent of that authority with respect to isolated wetlands (which are likely to occur in agricultural areas) has been in doubt (Kusler, 2004). While many State and local governments also have wetland laws and regulations on the books and some have increased wetland regulation since the SWANCC decision, many heavily agricultural States have little wetland regulation (Petrie et al., 2001). In these States, swampbuster may be the only remaining policy disincentive to wetland drainage."}, {"section_title": "Future of Compliance", "text": "Compliance mechanisms have seemingly been effective in promoting soil and wetland conservation. While USDA's Compliance Status Review appears to have flaws, these flaws do not mean that compliance rates are low. Evidence from other sources, primarily the National Resource Inventory (NRI), shows that soil erosion on HEL cropland and wetland conversion for agriculture have been sharply reduced. Farms that receive government payments appear to have reduced erosion more sharply than those that do not receive payments, especially in the case of wind-erodible soils. Nonetheless, enforcement of compliance requirements will continue to be a challenge. Finally, other problems could also be addressed using compliance mechanisms. Claassen et al. (2004) show that a compliance mechanism could be used to address nutrient runoff from land in crop production by encouraging the use of nutrient management or buffer practices. More generally, 86 percent of U.S. cropland is on farms that receive Federal program payments subject to compliance requirements. Thus, compliance could provide leverage in addressing any agri-environmental issue that occurs largely on land in crop production. However, adding multiple or costly compliance requirements could threaten the goal of income support by increasing the cost of farm program participation relative to its benefits."}, {"section_title": "The Environmental Quality Incentives Program-EQIP", "text": "EQIP was established under the 1996 Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform (FAIR) Act.

EQIP provides producers with technical and financial assistance for implementing and managing a wide range of conservation practices for crop and livestock production.

Livestock nutrient management practices accounted for 28 percent of funding, followed by soil erosion and land management with 19 percent of funds. The remaining 16 percent was used to address wildlife habitat management, crop nutrient management, and other concerns. Regionally, EQIP activity from 1997 to 2004 reflected the confluence of regionally important resource concerns and EQIP priorities. For example, livestock waste management practices obtained the lion's share of EQIP funds in the Northern Crescent, Eastern Uplands, and Southern Seaboard regions, where phosphorus and nitrogen from livestock production (see Agricultural Resources and Environmental Indicators, 2006 Edition / EIB-16 Economic Research Service/USDA   Wildlife habitat-6% Crop nutrients-6%"}, {"section_title": "Regional distribution of EQIP funds", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Soil and land conservation-19%", "text": "Other-4% Livestock manure nutrients-28% Water quality and conservation-37% AREI Chapters 2.2 and 4.5) far exceed cropland's ability to assimilate these nutrients.

In the Prairie Gateway, which generates substantial manure nutrients on confined animal operations, only 11 percent of EQIP funds were spent on livestock waste management.

Because eligibility has been broad, program decisionmakers have used other methods of targeting producers (such as by priority resource concern) or limited participation to stay within budget limits. In contrast, CSP narrows eligibility to focus on good stewards, and provides payments for the maintenance of some existing conservation practices as well as for the adoption of new practices. Producers become eligible after treating nationally significant resource concerns-soil quality and water quality-using appropriate conservation practices on at least a part of their farm. Depending on the extent to which they have addressed these and other resource concerns, producers may enroll in one of three CSP \"tiers.\" In tier I, producers may enroll only the portion of their farm on which soil and water quality concerns have been addressed by best management practices. Producers who have addressed soil and water quality concerns throughout their farm and agree to address at least one additional resource concern over the life of the contract (5-10 years) are eligible for tier II. Tier III participants must have treated all identified resource concerns-not just soil quality and water quality-with conservation practices before CSP enrollment.

Data from the 2004 CSP signup indicate that two-thirds of CSP payments were for new practices intended to (1) address local resource concerns (e.g., resource concerns other than the nationally significant concerns of soil quality and water quality), and (2) encourage practices or activities that improve or enhance resource quality beyond the minimum (quality criteria) standard. In a number of cases, these payments will be based on environmental performance rather than cost. Environmental indices, such as the soil condition index, will serve as proxies for environmental performance. Payments are to be based on the improvement in index values, ensuring that payments reflect likely environmental gains.

This new flexibility in conservation program design for working lands and livestock production complements traditional conservation efforts, such as land retirement. In many instances, environmental problems like pesticide and nutrient runoff are best addressed on actively cropped lands.

Cropland expansion has fueled much of the grassland conversion, particularly in years of strong crop demand. More recently, increases in population and income have driven substantial exurban development in grasslands (Conner et al., 2001). Reductions in grazing land resources nationwide, however, may mask variability in land-use coverage over time. In marginal cropping areas, cropland conversions (and reconversion to grassland) may be influenced by relative returns to crop and livestock production and changes in agricultural policies (see Chapter 5.2, \"Land Retirement Programs\").

Environmental effects of livestock grazing may include excessive foraging and trampling of vegetative cover, streambank erosion, and sediment/ nutrient loadings to water bodies that may harm riparian and upland habitat. Livestock grazing has been cited as a factor in the decline of threatened and endangered species under the Endangered Species Act.

According to NRCS, roughly 355 million acres of private grazing lands are in need of some form of conservation treatment (USDA, 2001). NRCS technical assistance is funded primarily through the Conservation Technical Assistance program, which allocated roughly $100 million toward grazing-related initiatives in FY2004 (USDA, 2005f). Development of soil surveys and ecological site descriptions for grazing lands, and approved conservation plans for grazing systems, will likely be emphasized in the coming years (USDA, 2005f). Comprehensive nutrient management plans (CNMPs), designed to minimize water quality impairment from manure nutrients, are an important element of an overall conservation plan for many animal operations. Of an estimated 257,201 farms with confined animals that are likely to need CNMPs, roughly one-fourth had pastured animals as the dominant type (USDA, 2003  matching funds to State, tribal, and local governments, as well as nongovernmental organizations, for conservation easement acquisition (see Chapter 5.6, \"Farmland Protection Programs\").

Incentives may also be limited for lands grazed under a lease agreement or informal arrangement, where the operator does not capture long-term benefits (Lewandrowski and Ingram, 1999). USDA farm programs have historically supported returns to crop producers through price supports and mitigation of crop risk. Farm support payments have largely been decoupled from production since 1996, but certain payments (such as loan deficiency payments) continue to be linked to crop production. Where USDA programs enhance crop returns relative to livestock grazing in marginal cropland areas, program incentives may have the unintended consequence of encouraging grassland conversion to crop production and discouraging reversal to grasslands (Conner et al., 2001). ERS analysis suggests that Federal crop insurance has contributed to cropland development in marginal cropping areas, although acreage effects have been small (Claassen et al., 2005). Policy mechanisms for conservation on private grazing lands are largely nonregulatory. While large confined animal operations are regulated as a point-source for waste discharge, onsite environmental effects of grazing are more diffuse and consequently less subject to mandatory controls. Adoption of conservation measures on grazing lands has relied largely on technical assistance and voluntary incentives, without regulatory or compliance mechanisms to ensure environmental standards. The proliferation of ranchettes (subdivisions of large rural tracts) in many areas represents a further challenge for conservation policy. Conservation concerns can be particularly significant, as smaller land holdings may be overstocked with animals relative to carrying capacity and manure-nutrient uptake. As owners do not generally depend on livestock for income, finan-cial incentives may be less effective in encouraging improved grazing systems. Effective strategies may require coordination of conservation activities across multiple landowners. Many Western ranches use a mix of Federal, State, and private lands for livestock grazing over the course of a year. Access to public lands is often critical to providing private parcels adequate time to recover within a rotational grazing regime. For much of the West, the success of conservation measures on private grazing lands may be linked to grazing policies for public lands."}, {"section_title": "Trends in Farmland Losses", "text": "While farmland converted to urban uses comes from a large base, urban areas have grown rapidly from a small acreage base (see Chapter 1.1, \"Land Use\"). On average, 2.2 million acres of farmland per year were converted to urban uses between 1992 and 2001, versus 1.1 million acres per year during the previous decade (Vesterby and Krupa, 2001). Still, this annual rate represents barely 0.2 percent of the Nation's 1.03 billion acres of cropland, grassland, pasture, and rangeland, and suggests little threat to the Nation's capacity to produce food and fiber (Barnard, 2000). Rapid urban development since World War II has been fueled primarily by population and economic growth, which has occurred in conjunction with increased automobile ownership, declines in average household size, and an increase in average residential lot sizes beyond the urban fringe (Heimlich and Anderson, 2001). The movement of urban populations to suburban locations has also increased development pressures (Barnard, 2004).

Land use management is a local prerogative by tradition and law, and every State has enacted measures that help protect farmland. An ERS analysis of the \"purpose clauses\" of State farmland protection laws and programs found that protecting rural amenities was cited by 36 States, along with protecting local food supplies (30 States), protecting environmental services-including water and air quality (29 States), protecting the local economy's natural resource-related jobs (23 States), and maintaining orderly development (18 States). The focus on protecting rural amenities most often stemmed from goals relating to the protection of open space and rural/agrarian character. Local jurisdictions and nonprofit organizations have adopted an expanding array of farmland protection programs since World War II. Agricultural/rural residential zoning defines minimum parcel sizes and may include limitations that restrict use to farm-related activities (farm family and labor housing, processing, and marketing). Another regulatory approach is right-to-farm laws, which protect farmers from nuisance lawsuits brought by neighbors objecting to normal farm activities, and sometimes from local governmentimposed ordinances that unreasonably restrict agricultural activities Voluntary approaches include preferential assessment, which allows jurisdictions to assess agricultural land for property tax purposes at its value in current agricultural uses instead of its full market value for potential urban (developed) uses.

For example, ERS estimated that costs incurred through use value assessment programs (a \"tax expenditure\") range from about $25,000 annually in Wyoming to $218 million annually in California. The national total is almost $1.1 billion annually (Heimlich and Anderson, 2001). Another major outlay is State and county PDR programs. Nineteen States have State-level PDR programs, and at least 41 local jurisdictions operate separate programs in 11 States (AFT, 2004a and. The average easement cost in State PDR programs was about $1,400 per acre, and nearly $2,000 per acre in local PDR programs. However, PDR expenditures are one-time expenditures to restrict development over the long term (or permanently).  , 2004a). This is slightly more than the annual tax receipts that are forgone through use value assessment (when capitalized at 4 percent, the 1995 value of U.S. public expenditures on use value assessment is estimated to be $27 billion). The amount of land preserved represents less than 1 percent of cropland that ERS estimates to be subject to some degree of development pressure (fig. 5.6.4). The total cost of preserving cropland subject to development pressure could be as much as $130 billion (Heimlich and Anderson, 2001). Despite State and local prerogatives in land use management, the Federal Government is increasingly partnering with local/State agencies and nonprofit organizations to protect farmland. Federal efforts to protect farmland began with the Agriculture and Food Act of 1981, which required Federal agencies to evaluate the impact of federally funded programs that converted farmland to nonagricultural uses and to consider alternative actions that would lessen the adverse impacts.

With this increase, FRPP is now authorized to spend almost as much annually as all State PDR programs combined. The high costs of permanently preserving farmland through PDR programs have generated support for TDR programs. While the sponsoring jurisdiction faces fewer costs, garnering taxpayer support in areas targeted to receive the urban densities being transferred is difficult, as is balancing the supply of and demand for development rights (Fulton et al., 2004). Fifty local jurisdictions have passed TDR ordinances, but only 15 TDR programs have individually preserved more than 100 acres (see AFT, 2001). Many land trusts exist to preserve farmland ( fig. 5.6.5). These private, nonprofit organizations accept donations of conservation easements on farmland and environmentally sensitive land. The donations benefit landowners in the form of Federal and State (in 10 States) income tax deductions. In Colorado, South Carolina, and Virginia, formal markets are developing that allow a landowner who donates an easement but cannot use the State tax credit to sell the unused credit to a third party (Conservation Fund, 2002)."}, {"section_title": "Issues in Farmland Protection", "text": "The public benefits that are lost when farmland is converted cannot be readily measured in money terms. Instead, the benefits are typically estimated based on what people are willing to pay to avoid the losses associated with the conversion of farmland-i.e., the loss of agricultural production  and rural amenities. Variation in local conditions leads to a wide range in estimates-from a fraction of a penny to more than a nickel per acre annually-to prevent the development of farmland. One analysis suggests this willingness to pay may exceed $1 billion annually for the United States (Heimlich and Anderson, 2001). Whether the benefits of farmland protection programs exceed program costs again depends heavily on local conditions. The direct costs of purchasing easements must be added to the value of urban benefits forgone when land is preserved (Lopez et al., 1994;Miller and Doering, 2004). Estimates for these opportunity costs are not readily available. In addition to program costs, farmland protection programs have other impacts on government budgets and on resident taxpayers. Jurisdictions may save money on public service costs by preserving farmland because farmland requires fewer public services than residential uses do. Preserving land may benefit nearby residents who can look forward to rural scenic views and open space for the length of the easement (often into perpetuity). However, farmland preservation may impose costs on potential new residents who then have to live in higher densities elsewhere, face higher land prices, or endure longer commutes if they seek rural land farther from employment centers. How programs are implemented, and the distribution of enrolled lands, will determine the impacts on government budgets and taxpayers. Farmland protection tools vary in their effectiveness at permanently preserving farmland, and providing intended benefits. For example, agricultural zoning exemptions allowing higher density residential development are common, and can limit the ability to preserve farmland. Agricultural districts may have limited success in areas where landowners commit to not develop only when their land faces little development pressure. Preferential assessment does little to preserve farmland in the long run because the capital gains from developing farmland usually exceed the rollback penalties for conversion. Preferential assessment may even encourage land speculation by reducing developers' costs of holding farmland in inventory. Because they result in permanent (or at least 30-year) restrictions on nonfarm development, PDR and TDR programs are considered to be the most effective in preserving agricultural lands. However, the actual effect of these programs on land development rates and patterns is uncertain. While the number of acres preserved can be counted, these programs may simply shift development pressures elsewhere. Also, compliance with/enforcement of development restrictions over the long term is not a sure thing. An often-cited argument in support of PDR programs is that they help keep farmland affordable for new farmers. In theory, once the development rights have been sold, the market value of the preserved land will reflect only its value in a farming use, and may be significantly lower than its residential market value. However, a recent study found little evidence that easement restrictions significantly lowered preserved farmland prices (Nickerson and Lynch, 2001). It could be that landowners who farm as a recreational pursuit are outbidding \"traditional\" farmers for the land. Though both TDR and PDR programs rely on conservation easements, economic implications and effectiveness can differ. Some PDR programs (due to ranking criteria and agency efforts to minimize costs) yield a pattern of preserved parcels that are widely separated. This raises questions about whether a \"critical mass\" of remaining farms can support farm input suppliers, and about the sustainability of remaining farms. TDR programs, on the other hand, have often been implemented in conjunction with reductions in allowed housing density (downzoning) of a large area. While many of the parcels in the downzoned area are not technically \"preserved,\" the combination of zoning and TDRs may be effective at preventing widespread development. It is much more difficult to change zoning on an area-wide basis than on individual parcels. As a consequence, large clusters of \"undeveloped\" farmland (the downzoned area) may be preserved through TDR."}, {"section_title": "Policy Developments", "text": "Most recently, States have begun to implement \"smart growth\" strategies. Smart growth is a catchall phrase to describe a number of land use policies for influencing the pattern and density of new development. Without prohibiting development outside designated areas, smart growth policies use incentives and disincentives to direct new development to existing urban areas with appropriate infrastructure. PDR programs are one tool used to meet these goals. The effectiveness of smart growth will depend on how the incentive effects of new policies differ from pre-existing policies (Nickerson, 2001)."}, {"section_title": "ARMS Phase II", "text": "Crop Production Practices and predecessor surveys were conducted annually from 1964 through 2004 by USDA's NASS with funding from ERS.
