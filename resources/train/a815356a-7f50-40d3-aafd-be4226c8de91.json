[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract: Reference intervals (RIs) for laboratory analyses by and large, are provided by analytical platform providers -the provenience and preanalytics of materials for the calculation of intervals often remain arcane particularly relating to the age group of donors. In an observational, prospective cohort study on 1467 healthy uniracial Caucasian residents >60 years of age, 105 frequently used lab tests were done on one blood sample. With a nonrestrictive definition of health, several pathological lab results pointing to occult disease have been found and published from SENIORLAB so far. The RIs found for hemoglobin in women went from 117.9 to 152.4 g/L (80-84 years) and in men from 124.9 to 170.6 g/L (90% confidence interval [CI]). This article lists RIs computed with SENIORLAB data for such frequently ordered analyses as platelet counts, vitamin B12 and folate, ferritin and analytes measured to estimate metabolic performance in glucose turnover. In fact, 64.5% of the cohort showed prediabetic fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and/or glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1c ); total serum folate levels but not red blood cell folate decreased with progressing age. As much as 66% of evaluable study participants had insufficient levels of 25(OH) vitamin D. Published reports from SENIORLAB are referenced in this article."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Ten years ago, the SENIORLAB study was designed to establish reference intervals (RIs) of current medical lab assays suitable for validation performed in elderly patients. At the onset and upon immediate evaluation, the RIs were computed on cross-comparative data sets usually grouping ages from 60 to 69, 70 to 79 and above 79 years of age. The study was concluded with RIs of most lab analyses performed. Questionnaires were sent to surviving participants in an endeavor to relate quality of remaining life years to lab values determined at the onset of disease. Here, we report part of the results in the context of geriatric medicine.\nBefore this paper goes into the data obtained, let us cite Georges Canguilhem (1904 Canguilhem ( -1995 [1] who tells us in his thesis on The Normal and the Pathological: 'M\u00e9decins et chirurgiens ont une information clinique et utilisent aussi parfois des techniques de laboratoire qui leur permettent de savoir malades des gens qui ne se sentent pas tels' (English translation: \"With clinical information at hand, doctors and surgeons sometimes use lab techniques to identify persons who are sick without signs and symptoms\").\nWith the extension of the human life span the laboratory medicine community began to scrutinize RIs applicable for validating assays ordered for older patients. There were already short lists of analytes available, the RIs of which substantially deviate from work force age groups. It has long been known that sex hormones decline and a number of parameters have joined an ever growing list, often immediately upon initial recognition of their importance in the improvement of diagnosis.\nAging, senescence and maturation are denominations with slightly different meanings. Whereas senescence is interpreted as endogenous degenerative processes leading to death, aging encompasses a wide array of passive or nonregulated, degenerative steps determined, at least in part, by exogenous factors; gradual deterioration with aging can be looked at as a fail-safe system with collateral turnover that is prone to repair [2] . Involution such as with the thymus may feign senescence and age-related decline in T cell output is a risk factor for many cancer types and infectious diseases [3] , thymic atrophy which starts at puberty in all vertebrates. When we submitted the study protocol of SENIORLAB to the competent agencies back in 2008, many studies had already addressed the question of specific RIs in the elderly. The summary of the then screened literature can be listed as is shown in Table 1 .\nThe increasing mean age of the world's population concerns all those survivors of accidental death unruffled by senescent biology. That there are differences in the causes of death among species and, ultimately among different human races and different individuals, was made evident from studies on the survivor patterns for cohorts of organisms. Pearl and Miner [4] described several possible types of survivor curves. In Figure 1 , curve A is characteristic of a population in which death is predominantly caused by disaster, predation or other random external selection forces.\nThe constant rate of removal results in a survivor curve that drops exponentially, gradually approaching zero; mortality of 50% per unit of time. The nonaligned pattern in B denotes an initially strong surviving population with increased susceptibility to death with age in the absence of compromising influences of any type whereas the shape C shows a survival curve from a population with abrupt termination of all members by natural processes, like senescence and the role it plays as an endogenous control phenomenon [4] . The list of institutions who are trying to get to grips with senescence biology and its impact on lab assays is long, such as those from the Framingham Study, the Leiden Longevity cohort or the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) and the Berlin Aging Study to name but a few are studied."}, {"section_title": "Good practice for statistics", "text": "During recent decade, many centers have scrutinized the accuracy of RIs. Providers of analyzer modules for routine lab assays release trustworthy RIs for each parameter, however, they do not always show how these results are obtained. Many of the currently used RIs for clinical laboratory assays are based on samples from younger adults and the industry shuffles files and recuses information if asked to show age ranges, race and sex of the RI providing populations. A large majority of the RIs of adults are established with repeat blood donors who have gone through detailed questionnaires on their health and qualification to donate. Healthy elderly individuals as donors for samples to establish RIs of seniors are not so easy to recruit as most of them fail to overcome the entry obstacles. The sample size for those qualified for nondiseased conditions remain difficult to achieve as for the statistical power to be met, the experts must agree that a minimum of 120 test results for a given analysis is required -this allows for the usual coefficients of variations of the test being studied. The sample size is also limited when group partitioning and filters for evaluation must be applied such as for definite drugs taken, filtering for analytes linked to the one addressed or partitioning by sex, age, ethnicity, menstrual cycle or menopause/andropause passed [5] . Of the appropriate statistical methods to establish the RIs, once the data are produced, nested analysis of variance (ANOVA) is the likely method of choice owing to its ability to handle multiple groups and being able to adjust for multiple factors. Outliers may be identified using the Box-Cox transformation. Either RIs or decision limit (\"cut-offs\") should be reported from the lab to the clinician but not both, according to a Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute's (CSLI) C28-A3c requirement. Age, gender distribution and association can be analyzed using the non-parametric Wilcoxon rank sum, Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests and quantile regression methods to estimate the 95 th percentile involving RIs. This cornucopia of encoding parameters brings the understanding of RI in the elderly into the limelight.\nThe SENIORLAB study, an observational, prospective cohort of voluntary subjectively healthy residents of Switzerland aged 60 years or older could be completed from 2009 within 2 years of the onset for evaluation of RIs. The study procedure is described in detail elsewhere [6] . A total of 1467 participants were included and a fasting blood sample was drawn under optimal preanalytical conditions. A simplified comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) form designed to assess the wellbeing of the participants included the following questions honestly answered (primary exclusion criteria): Drugs: do you take drugs containing steroids?, Are you under ill-adjusted antihypertensive therapy?, Do you suffer from thyroid diseases/ are you substituted with thyroid hormones?, Do you have diabetes mellitus?, Have you suffered from cancer during the last 5 years?, Were you hospitalized during the month prior to enrolment and Do you abuse alcohol? In contrast to many previous studies, SENIORLAB applied a tedious but diligent search in Caucasian elderly by applying exclusion criteria through a rigorous process before including the successful women and men in the study and the loading of each age decennium approached a Gaussian distribution ( Figure 2) . As of the time of this writing, 127 participants have passed away. Once a candidate to enter the study was accepted her/his obstacles continued at the stage of including her/his lab results for calculating the RI of a given analyte: the outliers were excluded and a trellis-work was set up holding back those participants with pathological results on analytes likely to influence the analyte under computation for RI; C-reactive protein (CRP) >10 mg/L proved to be the most frequent analyte excluded.\nMore than 110 laboratory analytes were measured, and a biobank is stored on our premises."}, {"section_title": "Reference intervals found for selected analytes", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Hematological and related tests", "text": "Many elderly people, in contrast to working age adults may expect mild anemia, often associated with medical comorbidities [7, 8] .

In the USA, the 3 rd National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) study focused on racial groups of elderly patients revealing a prevalence of anemia in men and women >65 years and approximately more than 10% in Blacks than in Caucasian residents [11, 12] . In patients over 85 years, this difference exceeded 20%.

We are currently in need of reference ranges suitable for healthy older subjects and unbiased by debilitated individuals. Indeed, the defining of the lower cut-offs provided by the World Health Organization (WHO) are 120 g/L for women and 130 g/L for men (WHO Technical Report Series 1968); these cut-offs do not account for age.\nThe complete blood count assays of SENIORLAB were done using a Sysmex\u2122 XE-5000 (Horgen, Switzerland) hematology analyzer and clinical chemistry assays followed routine workflow on modular platforms.\nTwo years later, in 2013, a retrospective evaluation of the surviving participants, 764 women and 631 men with ages ranging from 60 to 99 years old and the data were explored in more detail: mean Hb and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using logarithmic transformation in order to correct for skewness of the data. Overall, women had a mean Hb of 136 [95% confidence interval (CI) 120-155] and men had a mean Hb of 148 (95% CI 128-172). Detailed results by age groups are presented in Figure 3 . The Hb level was steady over age groups until 74 years of age for men and 80 years of age for women. Interestingly, only a few subjects fell outside the WHO limits with 20 women having a Hb less than 120 (2.9%) and 20 men a Hb less than 130 (3.6%) ( Table 2) .\nWe looked for frequent causes for anemia such as iron and vitamin deficiencies (folic acid and B12). In the cohort, 37 subjects had a ferritin level lower than 20 \u03bcg/L (2.9%). Among these, nine of the 37 (24.3%) had a low Hb (WHO definition) and only one of the 37 (2.7%) had a slightly lower mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (MCHC). The micronutrient folic acid and vitamin B12 were also assessed (see later); 98 subjects (7.8%) had folic acid <10 nmol/L. Among these individuals, six of 98 (6.1%) were anemic. The definition of vitamin B12 deficiency varies but is usually accepted as lower than 200 pmol/L in elderly persons: in the whole population, 398/1255 (31.7%) subjects had vitamin B12 levels <200 pmol/L and 105/1255 (8.4%) had vitamin B12 concentrations less than 150 pmol/L. Using these two limits, these subjects were anemic in 11/398 (2.8%) and four of 105 (3.8%), respectively. The impression of a limited impact of folic acid and B12 deficiency lingers in anemia of the elderly [13] .\nSENIORLAB is able to define new Hb RIs in elderly subjects reporting as healthy by the strict clinical criteria in a large cohort of subjects. The results show a very limited proportion of subjects with WHO defined anemia, thus indicating that even in older subjects, the discovery of a low Hb is likely to be associated to an underlying pathology.\nThe most apparent change seen in bone marrow along with senescence is decreased cellularity. By the 65 years of Please note the tendency for mild anemia in the very old healthy study participants of SENIORLAB. Data cut down to six age groups.\nage, hematopoietic marrow cellularity has been estimated to recede to 30% with fat taking over. Age-related qualitative changes in hematopoietic cells are: skewed X-chromosome inactivation, telomere shortening, accumulation of mitochondrial DNA mutations and micronucleus formation; growth hormone and erythropoietin loose part of their activation potency as is suggested by the NHANES III database. The prevalence of anemia was lowest among males between 17 and 49 years (1.5%) and highest (26%) in males older than 85 years and was found to be associated with poor nutritional status in 62% of 3751 community-dwelling older people in the PolSenior study [14] .\nTo treat such mild anemia or not depends on a diagnostic algorithm relating to its background. If this not an option then mild transfusion therapy might be prescribed but this has not gained ground, not the least because of persistent concern of transfusion-transmitted disease [15] ."}, {"section_title": "Platelet concentrations and clotting system", "text": "In contrast to red blood cells ( /L have a 10-year probability of developing autoimmune disorders of 12%.

However, both the clinical features of these individuals, as well as the natural history of their mild thrombocytopenia, often remain occult. Regrettably, an undetermined number of individuals may go on to develop an overt disease associated with a low platelet count, others may maintain normal or borderline platelet counts until late in their lives, but to date no consistent figures concerning these events are available.\nIn the elderly, immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is frequent and calls for treatment in the presence of bleeding episodes. Drug-induced thrombocytopenia must be considered in patients under poly-medications [17] which are limited to five in SENIORLAB.\nThe individual concentrations of platelets in the SEN-IORLAB cohort are on Figure 4 (n = 1424) and Table 3 .\nThus, SENIORLAB evaluates the RIs of one of the most commonly ordered laboratory tests, i.e. platelet counts, in the age groups most frequently seen in clinical medicine, i.e. seniors and the single values of the elderly show gender-and age-specific RIs deviating considerably from the commonly employed RIs. It follows, that the practice of using single gender-and age-independent RIs for platelet counts (e.g. 140-350 \u00d7 10 9 /L) should be abandoned for individuals aged 60 and more [18] . In any event, related age-adapted RIs in apheresis practice and clinical routine will reduce harm.\nPlatelets have long been at the forefront of research activities in Bern, Switzerland. Ernst L\u00fcscher co-discovered the thrombin receptor in these \"cells\" [19] and platelet participation in immunological reactions, hence their susceptibility for damage upon autoimmune triggers is now well recognized and important in clinical pictures in pediatrics and internal medicine [20, 21] . Successful treatment using i.v. immunoglobulin therapy anticipated by years the recognition of its action mechanism [22] . Treatmentnaive patients with immune thrombocytopenia should pass through a therapeutic strategy updated to most recent therapeutic acquisitions independently on mild thrombocytopenic platelet counts [21] .

A significant association between D-dimer and age was found at the median in this study (p < 0.0001). For practical reasons and to set the upper cut-off, our validation office applies the multiplication of the values by 10 times the age, a 90-yearold patient can go up to 900 \u03bcg/L, whereas a 50-year-old subject should keep their D-dimer level below 500 \u03bcg/L. SENIORLAB (Table 4) has not been able to measure D-dimers but increased D-dimer values in the elderly make AADD for patients older than 50 years mandatory."}, {"section_title": "Vitamin B12 and folate", "text": "Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) was identified more than 80 years ago as the antipernicious anemia factor in liver, and its importance in human health and disease has resulted in much work on its uptake, cellular transport and utilization. Plants do not contain cobalamin because they have no cobalamin-dependent enzymes.\nDeficiencies are therefore common in strict vegetarians, and in the elderly, who are susceptible to an autoimmune disorder that prevents its efficient uptake. In contrast, many algae are rich in vitamin B12, with some species, such as Porphyra yezoensis (Nori), containing as much cobalamin as liver [25] . The vitamin B12 and folate status in non-anaemic healthy older persons needs attention the more so as a decrease in levels may be anticipated from reduced hematinic provision and/or impaired intestinal uptake. After excluding the results of as many as 324 participants for elevated CRP, folate and/or B12 supplementation, and death after 1 year, 1143 results were available from the 637 women and 506 men with vitamin B12, holotranscobalamin (holoTC), methylmalonic acid (MMA), homocysteine (Hcy), serum folate and RBC folate [26] . Besides RI calculations, receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis was also done to assess the accuracy of the individual parameters in recognizing a deficient vitamin B12 status parameters. The age groups: 60-69, 70-79 and \u226580 years had median B12 (pmol/L) levels of 237, 228 and 231, respectively (p = 0.22), holoTC (pmol/L) of 52, 54 and 52 (p = 0.60) but Hcy (\u03bcmol/L) 12, 15 and 16 (p < 0.001), MMA (nmol/L) 207, 221 and 244 (p < 0.001). Hcy and MMA (both p < 0.001), but not holoTC (p = 0.12) and vitamin B12 (p = 0.44) were found to be affected by kidney function. Total serum folate and RBC folate drift apart with increasing age: whereas the former decreases (p = 0.01) RBC folate remains in the same bandwidth across all age groups (p = 0.12). A common RI combining age and gender strata can be obtained for vitamin B12 and holoTC, a more differentiated approach seems warranted for serum folate and RBC folate (Figures 5 and 6 ). These results can be set in relation to findings recently unfolded in the framework of the BLSA which for many aspects of studies into senescence goes back as early as 1958 to trace the effects of aging. Evaluation of gait speed is now considered by neurologists as a very reliable measure of functional capacity with well-documented predictive value for major health-related outcomes. Thus, the BLSA more recently, undertook measurements of B12 and other micronutrients in over 1000 male volunteers who at their entry into the study were examined for putative vitamin B12 and homocysteine associations with gait speed. As part of the BLSA, independent associations of serum levels of vitamin B12 and plasma concentrations of homocysteine with gait speed, 774 study participants were stratified for linear regression in age categories 50-69, 70-79 and 80 years old [27] . Gait speed (m/s) was assessed using the 6-min usual pace test. Vitamin B12 and homocysteine concentrations were collected using standard clinical protocols. Elevated homocysteine concentrations were associated with a decline in gait speed after adjustment for covariates, hence confirming previous reviews on 827 participants from the BLSA (mean age 67, range 50-96 years) in which the mean erythrocyte corpuscular volume (MCV) and cognitive performance was followed over time [28] ."}, {"section_title": "Vitamin D", "text": "The measurements of SENIORLAB on 25(OH) vitamin D have been published in an Open Source journal and are freely accessible; the reader is invited to consult the results on the Internet [29] . In brief, 66% of the subjects had insufficient levels of 25(OH) vitamin D; severely deficient levels of 25(OH) vitamin D were found in 7.98% of the total study population. Once again, this observation can be set in the dual and very opposite perception of so many healthy elderly persons having low vitamin D levels either being healthy, hence their RIs are normal for their age or that indeed, such low vitamin D levels call for routine substitution once a retired citizen reaches an age beyond 60 years. However, vitamin D levels have been found recently to be associated with cognitive performance and verbal memory and verbal fluency [30] and it is well recognized that low vitamin D levels favor a wide number of autoimmune diseases [31] . Larger population studies are needed to resolve this point of principle. Older adults might not adequately absorb micronutrients hence substitution and lab control of sufficiency will be mandatory."}, {"section_title": "Ferritin", "text": "The importance of serum protein ferritin, in addition to its iron storage and its acute phase reactant status, has recently been put into the context of its proinflammatory activity and interaction with inflammasome generation which is why our group became interested in this ubiquitous iron-biomineralizing nonocage protein. In mammals, the heteropolymers have two subunits, a heavy H and a light H (183 and 175 amino acids) which self-assemble to form a trinuclear iron cluster sprout into a 8 nm cavity surrounded by the protein shell of 12 nm external diameter. There, about 30 atoms of Fe +++ can be stored in the apoferritin cavity (Figure 7 ). In the case of hyperferritinemia, one first thinks of alcoholism, inflammatory syndrome, cytolysis and the metabolic syndrome. None of these possible backgrounds for hyperferritinemia is associated with substantial hepatic iron overload unless, in presence of an elevated transferrin saturation, hereditary hemochromatosis is responsible. Bleeding patients with polyglobulia or those suffering from erythroleukemia (M6 AML), or those with siderosis, must not only have a lower red blood cell count but also hyperferritinemia and physicians set the frequency of therapeutic bleeds in relation to a plasma ferritin level <50 ng/mL. Increased iron incorporation into the ferritin heavy chain homopolymer (FtH) leads to reduced cellular iron availability, diminished levels of cytosolic catalase, superoxide dismutase (SOD1) protein levels, enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and higher levels of oxidized proteins. The pathophysiological consequences of L-ferritin deficiency in a human has recently been shown in connection to the restless leg syndrome [33] unless it reflects iron deficiency on its own.

Plasma glucose levels were measured by means of the hexokinase procedure, and HbA 1c was measured chromatographically and classified using the current American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria whereby, for international understanding, some of us require the results in mml/mol units. The prevalence of individuals unaware of having prediabetic FPG or HbA 1c levels, was 64.5% (n = 878); unknown lab based T2DM was found in 8.4% (n = 114). On the basis of HbA 1c criteria alone, significantly more subjects with unknown FGP impairment and laboratory T2DM could be identified than with the FPG alone. The prevalence of PreD as well as of T2DM increased with age thus anticipating laboratory evidence of impaired glucose metabolism.

In addition, decreased sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion, reduced urinary concentrating capacity and alterations in the endocrine activity of the kidney add up to deterioration of renal function in the elderly.

The Clinical Consortium on Healthy Ageing (CCHA) commissioned by WHO features a multidisciplinary composition and encourages multi-institutional experts and innovators in the field of geriatric medicine to produce standards, clinical norms and guidelines, often even understood by the educated layman. SENIORLAB takes advantage of an increased recognition of ethical guidelines. Is it not delicate to contact family members of deceased participants and to ask them for the cause of death? We have experienced upset in telephone calls aimed at feeding the data set of SENIORLAB with additional information on the fate of participants during the last 8 years or so.\nIn fact, we wish to: (i) identify associations between different parameters, (ii) identify the power of lab assays to diagnose certain circumstances, (iii) identify the prevalence of occult disease in subjectively healthy individuals, and (iv) identify the prognostic factors for the investigated outcomes, including length of survival.\nSuch analysis would identify a given analyte as a biomarker. Along the whole SENIORLAB evolution those involved in communicating with study participants have gone through a learning process on how to tell lab results to apparently healthy seniors. The few outliers we found were immediately communicated to the participant and to her/his medic such that a second assay on a subsequent blood sampling was performed for confirmation/disconfirmation under medical surveillance. The participant was less frightened if an analysis could be situated into the context of senescence as is the case with slightly elevated HbA 1c or CRP levels now confirmed for a discrete w/v increment in seniors. In the PolSenior study, performed on over 4000 seniors over 65 years old, the IL-6 and CRP levels were higher in agingrelated diseases/disabilities and lower in successfully aging individuals and higher IL-6 and CRP levels were associated with poorer physical performance [38] . Progressing glycation in advanced glycation end products is considered as non-enzymatic modifications of proteins or lipids upon physiological exposure to sugars, occasionally accumulating in tissue [39] .\nRIs found in the SENIORLAB study ought to be understood by anybody interested in the field, including educated laymen -participants of the study or not. An ever increasing community of biologists, now estimated to add up to 2 million researchers worldwide, follow, observe and understand the message and bring them over to others. The skills likely to be in greater demand include interpersonal skills, higher cognitive skills and systems skills, all of them potentiating the usage of artificial intelligence (AI). Not only medicine proper but basic biological topics such as embryogenesis, maturation and senescence will be absorbed by such portals such as, e.g. www.ibm.com/ Watson and others.\nTo understand how diseases arise an extraordinary amount of information needs to come together; quick and inexpensive sequencing DNA and RNA now explores all the \"omes\": genome, the full set of genes, transcriptome, the RNA made from the genes, the metabolome: small molecules, such as sugars, fatty acids and amino acids, involved or generated by cellular processes and the fluxome: metabolic reactions whose rates can vary under different conditions. The Human Protein Atlas (https://www.proteinatlas. org/) includes a high-resolution map of the locations of more than 12,000 proteins. Data-driven medicine undoubtedly improves health care, we have come a long way since Carl von Rokitansky (1804-1878) gave medicine a firm scientific basis by introducing correlations between symptoms and the diseases that cause them.\nEnrolment of older people with hematological disorders into clinical studies still lags behind. This age group remains underrepresented in blood cancer clinical trials, according to a study presented at the 2017 Annual Meeting of the American Society of Hematology (ASH) by experienced Dr. Bindu Kanapuru, a hematologist in Falls Church, VA, USA (http://www.ascopost.com/News/58356). Age alone must not be an exclusion criterion. With only a few patients aged 75 years or older, critical information on the safety and effectiveness of new therapies is at loss which also pertains to the value of medical laboratory assays if age-specific RIs are at stake. The magnitude of the disparity is particularly concerning given that the number of adults aged \u226575 years who are diagnosed with hematological malignancies is expected to rise as the population ages. Currently, one out of five patients diagnosed with blood cancers is aged 75 years and older [40] http://www.hematology.org/Newsroom/Press-Releases/2017/8067.aspx.\nObviously, pharmaceutical companies are reluctant to include these older patients in phase III clinical trials, because of the uncertainty on how they will tolerate investigational medications and because of approaching death. This population is also extremely heterogeneous.

Impressively, copper (Cu) amounts to 1.4-7.2 \u03bcmol/L the first 5 days of life and thereafter, and certainly after age 1 year, Cu in plasma goes as high as 11.9-30 \u03bcmol/L in healthy children -Cu being an essential microelement found in all living organisms with the unique ability to adopt two different redox states -in the oxidized (Cu   2+   ) and reduced (Cu + ) [41, 42] ."}, {"section_title": "Open questions", "text": "The SENIORLAB study remains active with some questions waiting for an answer about using RIs for the validation of lab results (i) Definition of health. Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity (Official Records of WHO, no. 2, p. 100, 1948). Depending on the field of interest, health needs to be defined in a broad sense such as those of being sound in body, mind or spirit. Various online news sources reflect current usage of the term \"health\" as a wide array. Some authors have argued that older people are less study-oriented than younger people, lack the skills to participate or do not want to be actively involved in research and developing services [43] . (ii) The finding of intervals which deviate from RIs in use for work-force age groups comes as little surprise with certain analytes. Thus, the slightly lower median hemoglobin concentrations or the slightly higher CRP and HbA 1c concentrations in the elderly reflect nothing but the biochemistry of senescence. These findings are very far away from the finding of 25(OH) vitamin D concentrations in the low ranges, now confirmed by other authors to occur in the elderly [44] . (iii) Whether to take into consideration or forget about specific RIs of the elderly for validation purposes is a still a debated contrasting juxtaposition [45] . There are pros and cons. Gender partitioning with sex related hormones is now clearly an issue, since SEN-IORLAB reveals sex differences in certain hormones, none the least in cortisol. Conversely, substitution of low vitamins B12 or vitamin D likely prolongs survival, contributes to quality of remaining life expectancy. (iv) Chronobiological aspects with nyctohemeral opal variance of results are well known for cortisol, peaking in the morning, as for plasminogen activator inhibitor and this has been outlined in detail elsewhere [46] ."}]
