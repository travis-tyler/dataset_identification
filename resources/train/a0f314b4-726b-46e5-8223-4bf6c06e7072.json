CES recovered a wealth of historical microdata \"trapped\" on a Census Bureau Unisys computer that was scheduled to be decommissioned and not replaced. Thousands of files containing data from as early as 1953 were recovered. The recovered business data encompass nearly all sectors of the economy, including manufacturing, mining, retail, wholesale, services, construction, transportation, and agriculture. Decennial Census data for Puerto Rico and monthly supplements to the Current Population Survey were also recovered. The project is already paying off. For example, CES researchers are using the data developed in the 1980s for the renowned economic researcher Zvi Griliches. These data extend CES holdings of the Survey of Industrial Research and Development as far back as 1957 for many large firms. However, many of the other files will first require significant work-essentially data archaeologyto deduce record layouts and file structures. Developing these data far exceeds CES' own resources. To make the recovered data ready for use, CES actively seeks partners within the research community. The Center for Economic Studies (CES) and the U.S. Census Bureau's network of Research Data Centers (RDCs) host research on a broad range of topics in demography, economics, geography, sociology, and other social sciences. Each year, our annual research report highlights findings from different topics and fields. The first article in this issue summarizes research on several topics in corporate finance.

The finance literature poses a number of important questions that cannot be addressed without the appropriate data. Such questions include the efficiency of the merger and acquisition market, the effectiveness of the bankruptcy process, and the rationality of firms' choices of combinations of industries in which to operate. These questions are at the core of our understanding of corporate governance institutions and their functioning. Do these institutions act in the shareholders' interest? The answers also have important implications for competition, as intraindustry mergers reduce the number of competitors in the market. Do such mergers provide offsetting benefits to the economy, such as productivity gains? Addressing the questions raised by changes in corporate identity requires longitudinal information about a representative sample of firms, their financial information, as well as data on the establishments that belong to those firms. Commercially available data are currently not up to the task. They do not effectively track the changes in corporate structure, which assets they operate over time, which they acquire or divest, and which they shut down or open up. Moreover, it is extremely difficult to obtain useful financial data on privately held U.S. corporations. The U.S. Census Bureau through the Center for Economic Studies (CES) and its network of Research Data Centers (RDCs) provides a way for researchers to access such rich datasets. Census Bureau establishment-level data allow researchers to understand how firms organize themselves and make micro-level decisions; that is, to disentangle what is happening within the firm. Researchers approved to access the data can address questions about firm organization, mergers and acquisitions, bankruptcy, and whether public and private firms behave differently. Research based on establishment-level data is yielding important insights into the inner workings of corporations. 1 This chapter discusses the advantages of Census Bureau data over other corporate databases for addressing these questions and summarizes findings of our and other researchers' work using the data. Our studies suggest that the mergers and acquisitions market, the bankruptcy process, and conglomerate firm formation tend to improve productivity. 1 See Appendix 1 about CES and RDCs. Researchers must have approved projects to access Census Bureau microdata.

Groups of activities representing at least 10 percent of a firm's sales, assets, or profits are reported separately. Thus, the maximum number of different industries that can be observed for any firm in the data is 10, so the true degree of diversification cannot be determined. Firms decide which activities are grouped into each line of business, and these decisions vary across firms, making cross-firm comparisons difficult. It is also hard to track firms' changes in diversification, as they frequently change the number of lines of business they report, even when there has been no real change in their operations. Hyland (1997) estimates that up to a quarter of reported changes in the number of lines of business stem from changes in reporting policy rather than the actual level of diversification. Bens, Berger, and Monahan (2009) show that firms make these decisions strategically, e.g., aggregating lines of business to hide unprofitable lines. Classification (SIC) code to their output. Researchers can compare the productivity of every establishment owned by the firm against other establishments in the industry. The extent of multiestablishment firms' operations can be measured by industry on an annual basis and establishments can be followed over time even when owners change."}, {"section_title": "BANKRUPTCY NOT ASSOCIATED WITH INEFFICIENT ASSET REALLOCATION", "text": "Some of the advantages of the LRD can be seen in the Maksimovic and Phillips (MP) (1998) study on the efficiency of the U.S. bankruptcy process. The process is designed to give firms in financial distress the opportunity to restructure their debt and sell or close some of their assets, thereby regaining solvency. Creditors desiring immediate payment, however, may pressure firms to sell assets that are more valuable in those firms than under anyone else's ownership, reducing productivity. It is therefore important to understand whether bankruptcy works as intended. The previous literature has attempted to address these questions by examining how firms perform before and after bankruptcy. However, firms may control very different sets of assets before and after the process. It is more meaningful to compare the same assets' performance over time. In MP (1998) we address bankruptcy efficiency with detailed LRD establishment-level data A second advantage of Census Bureau microdata is that industry classification codes are assigned at the establishment level, providing a much more detailed picture of firms' diversification than is provided in commercially available datasets such as the COMPUSTAT segment files (see Text Box 3-1). Unlike COMPUSTAT data, Census Bureau establishment-level industry coding only changes when actual operations change, and the number of reported industries is not capped at 10. Corporations listed on stock exchanges (publicly traded corporations) are the focus of nearly all financial research because data on unlisted (privately held) companies are not publicly available. The nonpublic Census Bureau data, however, cover both listed and unlisted companies. Combining commercially available COMPUSTAT data with nonpublic census microdata, Davis et al. (2007) reports that unlisted companies employ 71.4 percent of the workforce in 2000 and have very different growth patterns than listed companies. This suggests that results based on listed companies may not apply to unlisted firms. Most of the studies reviewed in this chapter rely on the Longitudinal Research Database (LRD), a longitudinally linked version of the Census Bureau's Annual Survey of Manufactures (ASM). 2 Observations are at the establishment level."}, {"section_title": "Establishments assign a fourdigit Standard Industrial", "text": "2 The exception is Villalonga (2004)."}, {"section_title": "IMPORTANT ADVANTAGES TO USING NONPUBLIC CENSUS MICRODATA", "text": "In addressing questions about corporate asset allocation and reallocation, researchers face the usual challenges in applied work-identifying the effect of interest and disentangling the variables driving mergers and diversification. Compared to other applied work, the difficulties are greater here because the unit of analysis can change during the period of study. Unlike a real person, who has a definite identity, a corporation can, and often does, change the composition of its assets, the industries in which it operates, its management team, and its financing methods. The Census Bureau's rich longitudinal microdata provide several advantages. Consider, for example, measuring the effect of some event (e.g., a change of control or a demand shock) on performance. Firms may buy and sell assets in response to the event. The usual firm-level analysis using commercially available datasets compares the performance of the firm before and after the event. However, the composition of the firm changes in response to the event, confounding before vs. after comparisons. Such comparisons are especially problematic for firms entering bankruptcy or engaging in mergers, as assets divested, closed, or purchased are typically much different from the other assets the firm owns. Census Bureau data allow researchers to follow the individual establishments before and after an event. experience a statistically significant decline in productivity. 3 To test whether Chapter 11 and nonbankrupt firms make different decisions about selling establishments, we estimate a statistical model predicting whether an establishment will be sold or closed. The probability that an establishment with given characteristics is sold or closed is qualitatively similar whether the owner is bankrupt or not. Bankruptcy status, per se, does not explain why bankrupt firms have a higher probability of selling assets than other firms. Rather, firms entering bankruptcy more frequently own establishments with characteristics associated with sale or closure, such as low productivity. 3 Please see the source publications for details and specific exceptions to the qualitative interpretations of the results cited in this chapter.

The table shows establishments' relative productivity (compared to the industry average) from the year prior to entering Chapter 11 through 4 years after entering Chapter 11. Each row of the table refers to establishments staying in Chapter 11 for a certain number of years and follows them over time. In low-growth industries there is little evidence that establishment-level productivity declines while firms in Chapter 11 operate them, as none of the productivity changes are statistically significantly negative. In MP (1998) we show that broadly similar results hold for high-growth industries, with the exception that firms remaining in bankruptcy for 4 or more years from a sample of 1,195 establishments of 302 firms that sought the protection of Chapter 11 of the U.S. bankruptcy code between 1978 and 1989. We use a panel of over 50,000 LRD establishments belonging to both public and private nonbankrupt firms as controls. The data enable us to track changes in the composition of firms as they sell and close establishments. Thus, our evaluation of reorganizations is not subject to the sample selection bias arising from using firm-level data. We measure how establishment productivity and cash flows (proxied by value of shipments minus materials, energy, and labor costs) evolve under Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Table 1 shows the productivity results for bankruptcies in low-growth industries (ones in the lowest quartile of growth between Table 1.

Only establishments in low-growth industries are included, where low-growth industries are those in the bottom quartile of the distribution of change in 10-year shipments at the three-digit SIC code level . The industry adjustment is done by subtracting the industry average TFP from the establishment's TFP, where industry is defined at the four-digit SIC code level . Industry-adjusted TFP is then standardized by dividing the TFP by the standard deviation of TFP in the establishment's four-digit industry . The numbers in parentheses are t-statistics for significant differences from zero . industry firms. This calls into question the previous research. In MP (2002) we use the LRD to directly measure how the productivity of diversified firms' lines of business (measured at the threedigit SIC level) varies by the number of lines and each line's relative size within the firm. Figure  1 below summarizes the data for two-to five-segment firms in the U.S. manufacturing sector for the years 1979-2002. 5 The segment numbers refer to the ranks of a firm's lines of business based on production, with number 1 being the highest-producing segment. Controlling for the number of lines of business in a diversified firm, industry-adjusted productivity decreases as the line's relative size within the firm falls. This is consistent with a model where firms spread their operations across a range of industries in which they have a comparative advantage and decreasing returns to scale. But the results may also reflect conflicts of interest like those mentioned above. Large, productive firms can waste resources by diversifying into industries in which they do not have a comparative advantage. To distinguish between these interpretations, MP (2002) examines how firms respond to industry demand shocks. According to a simple neoclassical model, firms should build up the lines of business in which they have a comparative advantage and that have received a positive demand 5 Maksimovic and Phillips (2002) shows the results for firms with more than five segments as well, and the pattern is similar. (1995). These researchers disaggregate multi-industry (conglomerate) firms into their constituent industry lines of business using COMPUSTAT data. They value these lines by comparing their Tobin's q (market value divided by replacement value of assets, a common performance indicator) to that of single-industry firms in the same industries. They find that the typical conglomerate is undervalued and selling at a discount compared to a collection of comparable singleindustry firms. The conglomerate discount presents a puzzle, as it implies that shareholder wealth would be greater if more firms were organized as single-industry firms. Many subsequent papers have confirmed the presence of a conglomerate discount. A major concern with this research is that it is based on COMPUSTAT data that are sub-ject to the measurement problems discussed in the first section above. Villalonga (2004) finds that the results are highly sensitive to how diversification is measured. When using COMPUSTAT data to measure firm diversification, Villalonga obtains the standard result that diversified firms trade at a discount compared to singleindustry firms. She reclassifies the firms' diversification using the Census Bureau's Business Information Tracking Series (BITS) dataset. 4 After reclassification, diversified firms trade at a significant premium over single-We find little evidence that the bankruptcy process, even when prolonged, leads to inefficient restructuring or bad disposal decisions."}, {"section_title": "RATIONAL WITHIN-FIRM ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES", "text": "The distribution of firms' activities across industries is a key research focus in corporate finance. Managers' choices about this distribution may not always be in shareholder interests. Managers may desire earnings stability to achieve bonus targets or reduce the possibility of being fired by boards focused on last quarter's earnings. Firms can smooth earnings by entering new industries. They may have little experience in the new industries, however. Though shareholders may also desire earnings stability, they could achieve it more efficiently by investing in a portfolio of single-industry firms, each an expert in its field. Closing poorly performing lines of business can entail painful layoffs, resistance from division chiefs, and admitting defeat. To avoid this, managers may wish to redirect cash flows generated from profitable lines toward the loss-making ones. Such actions can reduce firms' overall profitability, damaging shareholders. Researchers have tried to uncover the extent to which these potential conflicts of interest actually occur. The seminal papers on the distribution of firms' activities across lines of business are Lang and Stulz (1994) and Berger and Ofek differences are greatest in highgrowth industries. Moreover, multi-industry firms use cash flows generated in some lines of business to relax financing constraints in other lines that do not generate enough cash flows to fund the optimal level of investment."}, {"section_title": "PROFIT-MAXIMIZING MERGERS AND ASSET REALLOCATION ACROSS FIRMS", "text": "The central question financial economists ask about mergers and acquisitions is: Do mergers increase the value and productivity of corporations? Analysis of this question immediately raises a series of subsidiary shareholder interests. However, our interpretation is that a \"new toy\" effect is also consistent with diseconomies of scope, so that management allocates time optimally to higher return diversifying activities at the expense of their past ones. In MP (2008) we study how multi-industry and singleindustry firms' sales expand in industries at different stages in the industry life cycle. We find that single-industry firms tend to grow by increasing the size of their existing establishments and starting new establishments, whereas acquisitions of other firms' establishments are more important for multiindustry firms' growth. These shock. They should disinvest in spheres in which they are not efficient and that have received a negative demand shock. Our results are consistent with this model. Also using the LRD, Schoar (2002) finds related results. She examines firms after they purchase plants and finds that acquired-establishment productivity increases after the acquisition. The productivity of the firms' other establishments declines, suggesting that managers reallocate time from existing establishments to new establishments. She calls this a \"new toy\" effect and suggests that this is indicative of managerial decision-making inconsistent with all firms in an industry experience similar changes in cost and demand conditions, firms adjust their size via changes in the size of their establishments or by opening or closing establishments. In contrast, if changes in cost and demand conditions vary considerably across firms in the industry, firms adjust via asset trades-firms with rising productivity buy assets and those with falling productivity downsize. We also find that acquirers in mergers do not mechanically keep all the assets of the target that they acquire. Rather, they readjust their boundaries to account for their comparative advantage and the opportunity cost of keeping the assets. Maksimovic, Phillips, and Prabhala (2008) shows that acquirers of listed firms sell about 27 percent of the purchased establishments within 3 years after the acquisition. The sold establishments tend to be ones in the purchased firm's peripheral divisions. Productivity increases after the acquisition in establishments that are kept, but not in the establishments that are sold. This pattern is consistent with the hypothesis that acquirers keep the assets they can exploit efficiently, and they maintain managerial focus by selling or closing the assets that they cannot exploit efficiently."}, {"section_title": "PRIVATE EQUITY AND PRODUCTIVITY", "text": "The relative strengths of the Census Bureau data are also highlighted in Davis et al. (2009). The authors link Census Bureau data to private data with profit maximization rather than a model where managers avoid painful restructuring by retaining and subsidizing inefficient establishments using resources generated by more successful divisions. We find that the likelihood that an establishment is sold goes up as the share of the firm's output produced by the establishment's line of business decreases. The finding is consistent with the notion that diversified firms divest from their smallest and least productive divisions and redeploy their assets. We track who buys establishments and firms and find that more productive firms are more likely to be buyers. Examining purchased establishments before and after purchase, we find that productivity increases with the difference between the buyer's productivity and the purchased establishment's productivity. Yang (2008) investigates why mergers cluster by time and industry. According to her theoretical model, firms expand when productivity rises and contract when it falls. They can expand through investing in new assets or through external acquisition of other firms' assets. The relative price of other firms' assets compared to new investment is higher if other firms in the industry also wish to expand. Growth via acquisitions is thus more likely if firms' productivity growth is heterogeneous, i.e., when not all firms wish to expand at the same time. Using the LRD, Yang finds results consistent with the model. If issues. When are firms sold in their entirety and when do firms just trade assets, such as establishments, with each other? What happens after a mergerdo the acquirers typically operate the assets they buy, or is a merger the first step in a series of restructuring moves? Why do acquisitions cluster by time and industry? Do listed firms participate differently than unlisted firms? Here we highlight the role of the market for partial-firm sales, which cannot be analyzed using commercially available firmlevel data. Using the LRD in MP (2001), we find that during the 1974-1992 period, an annual average of 1.94 percent of all manufacturing establishments change ownership in partial-firm transactions. This is comparable to the 1.95 percent rate at which manufacturing establishments change ownership in all-firm mergers and takeovers over the period. Similar rates of partial-firm sales occur in both growing and declining industries. Conglomerates dominate in the partial firm market-sellers operate in an average of 10 four-digit SIC industries and buyers in 8. We find that establishments in productive lines of business are less likely to be sold, especially when the industry is expanding. Most importantly, an establishment's probability of being sold is higher if the firm has more productive operations in other industries. The probability of being sold increases further if the more productive operations are in growing industries. These patterns are consistent Public firms are also more sensitive to macroeconomic factors like credit spreads and industry equity returns. Establishments acquired by public firms enjoy larger productivity gains than those acquired by private firms. The improvement is greater if the acquisition occurs when acquisition activity is high, especially when the acquirer is a public firm. We show that the results are not driven solely by the fact that public firms have better access to capital. Using productivity from 5 and 10 years prior to the acquisition, we document that more productive firms select to become public and participate more in productivity-increasing acquisitions. The results are consistent with the notion that better firms become public in anticipation of accessing capital in public markets when buying opportunities arise."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "Many important questions vexing policy makers and researchers have gone unanswered due to limitations in publicly available data. Questions such as whether the merger and acquisition market is efficient or has been a waste of corporate resources continue to be debated. Other questions that have been the focus of research and policy debate include whether the bankruptcy process is efficient and whether conglomerate firms operating in multiple industries do so productively. The good news is that the detailed databases at CES enable transactions by linking these data to the LRD. The authors find private equity groups act as a catalyst for reallocation through the intensification of entry, exit, acquisition, and divestitures of establishments. They find that this intensification of reallocation yields a substantial productivity growth differential (about 2 percent) within 2 years following the transaction. About two-thirds of this differential is due to improved productivity among continuing establishments of the firm (including the effects of shifting resources from less to more productive establishments) and about one-third due to net entry. The contribution of net entry is dominated by the closure of underperforming establishments."}, {"section_title": "LISTED FIRMS PRODUCE BIGGER PRODUCTIVITY GAINS IN CORPORATE MERGER AND ACQUISITION MARKET", "text": "Access to Census Bureau data on both publicly listed and privately held firms allows us to fill an important gap in the mergers and acquisitions literature.

Previous attempts at answering these questions have serious limitations. First, they rely on small samples or on surveys with incomplete and perhaps selective responses, raising doubts as to whether the data accurately reflect the experiences of firms acquired by private equity groups. Second, the underlying data offer little scope to control for changes at comparable firms. Third, studies typically focus on the company-wide performance of firms backed by private equity and are therefore unable to distinguish the productivity effects of continuing, entering, and exiting plants as well as those that are acquired or divested.

Griliches led efforts to develop a longitudinallylinked dataset containing 1957-1965 companylevel data from the Survey of Industrial Research and Development (SIRD) matched to data from the 1958 and 1963 CM and Enterprise Statistics (ES). Griliches (1980) details this effort and discusses limitations of the data. Using these linked data, he found a positive relationship between investments in R&D and company productivity. Griliches returned to the Census Bureau to extend his work in the early 1980s. Unfortunately, the data from his original project had been lost (Griliches, 1986). With Census Bureau staff doing the hands-on data work, Griliches designed a new dataset. The new dataset contained 1957-1977 firmlevel data from the SIRD matched to data from the 1962, 1967, and 1977 ES and data from the 1967 and 1972 CM. The sample was limited to certainty companies from the 1972 SIRD and contains approximately 1,100 companies. Griliches highlights three findings in his 1986 paper: (1) investments in R&D make a positive contribution to productivity growth; (2) basic research is a more important contributor to productivity than other types of R&D; and 3privately-financed R&D expenditures appear to be more effective at the company-level than federally-financed R&D expenditures. The data underlying the findings in Griliches (1986) were recently recovered from the Unisys machine as part of the historical data recovery project. 4 CES currently has data from the SIRD going back to 1972. The addition of the Griliches sample extends our historical information for many large R&D companies back to 1957. While the Griliches sample is limited to large companies and key SIRD variables (e.g., total R&D expenditures, number of scientists and engineers), up to 15 additional years of data will now be available for many large R&D companies.

Abowd-Cornell University Kevin L. McKinney-U.S. Census Bureau Lars Vilhuber-Cornell University This project will compute novel statistics useful in the analysis of older workers' mobility and retirement decisions using individual data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) with indices created from the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) infrastructure microdata. It will create refined employment opportunity indices based on detailed characteristics of the potential retirees. Currently available statistics, such as the LEHD's Quarterly Workforce Indicators, provide detailed statistics by simple characteristics of the workforce, such as gender and age. This project will include additional characteristics in the computation of the employment opportunity indices. These include the respondents' previous industryspecific employment experience, the retirement decisions of similarly experienced individuals, and the mobility decisions of similar individuals. There would be three new types of indices: (1) a \"job matrix,\" which captures the geographic mobility patterns in employment; (2) a \"mobility matrix,\" which captures residential geographic mobility; and (3) an \"opportunity index,\" which is a person-specific convolution of these two matrices. The observed job mobility patterns of LEHD individuals, and in particular of older workers, will be used to estimate industry mobility patterns of recently hired workers at a detailed geographic level of work locations, the job matrix. The critical research issue is to determine the level of integration at which the new indices will be combined with existing data to produce a model estimation and forecasting framework. The observed geographic mobility of both LEHD and HRS individuals will be used to compute migration patterns of older workers and recent retirees to new residence locations, the mobility matrix. The mobility matrix (conditional on the HRS individual's residence at any point in time) can be used to weight the job matrix (conditional on the HRS individual's current or previous job characteristics), thus obtaining a person-specific job opportunity index, which is then incorporated into the relevant model. The utility of the proposed new indices, at the detailed and the aggregate level, will be assessed in a model-based framework. Using detailed demographic and geographic attributes of individuals, available on the HRS data with geographic supplement, models of the joint determination of geographic mobility, and retirement will be estimated and tested for independence of these two decisions. This project uses detailed longitudinal information from all waves of the National Longitudinal Surveys (NLS) to examine lifecycle migration patterns across education and gender groups. This will extend earlier work examining the causal role of a college education in subsequent geographic mobility to answer the important questions of why and how going to college increases long distance mobility. The project will also study gender differences in lifetime migration patterns, particularly the manner in which these have evolved across cohorts. Migration patterns for women may have changed along with the dramatic increase in education and labor force participation women experience over the latter half of the twentieth century. This project will determine whether that is the case and will explore mechanisms through which any changes in female migration patterns occurred. Restricted versions of the NLS contain information on state of residence for every year an individual is observed in the survey, data that are essential to constructing measures of migration. The NLS also provide an array of information on family history, education and work experience, and personal characteristics that are important to understanding the conditions surrounding individual migration decisions. The project will use longitudinal data to construct complete migration histories of a representative sample of U.S. residents, applying information in the migration histories to test ideas about which mechanisms explain the different rates of long distance moves across education and gender groups. The research will provide a detailed picture of lifecycle migration patterns and will compare migration trends observed in cross-sectional data with those observed in the NLS. The study of lifecycle migration will also provide important insight into a major cause of sample attrition, as respondents who move are often lost to subsequent data collection efforts. The analysis will explicitly examine the assumption that movers differ from nonmovers in important ways, giving insight into who is likely to be missing and why. This project uses establishmentlevel data to estimate returns to scale in U.S. manufacturing and construction firms. Understanding how the degree of returns to scale shapes the production of investment goods will be instrumental for the U.S. Census Bureau to understand establishment-level data. Constructing a comprehensive panel of manufacturing firms and estimating production functions can identify the degree of returns to scale at the establishment level. Regressing output on factor inputs will deliver the degree of returns to scale. Prices for equipment and structure investment behave very differently which suggests differential technologies and returns to scale. To pay special attention to that difference, the Census of Construction Industries is used to contrast construction firms to manufacturing establishments. This project benefits the Census Bureau by correcting for measurement error, imputing capital stock for manufacturing establishments in the Annual Survey of Manufactures, seasonally adjusting older (annual) Plant Capacity Utilization data, and estimating capacity utilization for a large population of manufacturing plants that is not covered at present. This project will also deliver a precise estimate of the degree of returns to scale that is free from aggregation bias. This information is very relevant by helping to assess two competing theories of macroeconomic fluctuations.

Economists care about reallocation at the plant level because of its role in generating improvement in aggregate productivity. In contrast to previous work on reallocation, this project will explicitly model the forwardlooking choices of firms. When a firm decides to open a new ready-mix concrete plant, or shut down a steel mill because of foreign competition, it does so because it's expectation of the net present value of profits are greater than the cost of either shutting down the plant or opening a new one. This project is composed of several separate subprojects designed to look at the forwardlooking choices made by firms in different industries and how these generate reallocation. Changes in the ownership of establishments and establishing longitudinal links for firms over time will be used to evaluate the quality of the Master Business Register. The proposed analysis of changes in productivity will inform the quality of measurement of inputs and outputs in the economic census. In addition, several new estimates will be produced that relate to measurement error in productivity and the economic mechanisms driving reallocation of production towards more efficient units. This study will document the role of reallocation and entry and exit in shaping the productivity dispersion in the readymix concrete sector, as well as the role of measurement error of output and inputs in economic census questionnaires. Changes in the ownership of plants will be examined to identify the quality of Employer Identification Numbers (EIN) in census data. Since multi-plant ownership is associated with lower exit rates, the ownership of plants matters. This project will provide insight into the decision of firms to sell off assets, as well as the entry and exit decisions of firms rather than plants. It will analyze the effect of trade on plants in the textile and steel sectors. These sectors have been exposed to substantial changes in the strength of international competition over the last 30 years, due principally to the elimination of tariffs and quotas. This analysis will shed light on how the trade environment affected the speed of reallocation of resources such as employment and physical capital across plants in these sectors of the economy and whether this resulted in aggregate productivity gains.

The measurement of job transitions will provide several important benefits to the U.S. Census Bureau. The Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWI) currently provide information on worker flows by worker characteristics and within fairly general (2-digit) industries, but the underlying data can support more disaggregated presentations. The project develops statistics that distinguish mass layoffs from other sources of worker flows and on the relation of the various types of flows to worker and plant characteristics. It explores the sensitivity of these measures to alternative methods for measuring displacement, and discusses options for incorporating statistics on mass layoffs into the QWI data. The first step in development of prototype QWI extensions will be the creation of consistent time series of employment at each firm, taking account of spurious changes arising from data shortcomings. This will be used to identify firm events such as establishment closings and mass layoffs under several definitions.

By constructing measures of volatility from census micro datasets and comparing these with external measures of volatility, the likely extent of measurement error in the census datasets can be evaluated.

Finally, plant-level measures of internal corporate governance will be aggregated into firm-level measures of internal corporate governance (e.g., the \"weighted average distance\" between headquarters and the firm's plants) that can be used to investigate the role of internal corporate governance at the firm level (e.g., for equity prices or the conglomerate discount). Using the 2005-2007 American Community Survey (ACS) data as a test bed, the research aims at producing public-use synthetic data files. In addition, the research will evaluate the quality of the inferences made from synthetic data by comparing small-area estimates with the synthetic data and the observed data. Specifically, this project will benefit the Census Bureau by testing a new method for tabulating census data for small geographic areas. The fully synthetic data approach proposed improves upon current methods of analyzing small-area data, which often require knowledge of complex indirect estimation techniques, linking administrative data, and specialized statistical software to achieve adequate statistical power. This approach will generate synthetic data values that preserve the statistical properties of the observed data values and facilitate use of direct estimation techniques and standard statistical software, while enhancing data confidentiality protection.

Census microdata also allows for quantification of the effect of those other variables identified as potential determinants of investment. The focus on a time period around a sizeable tax reform represents a unique opportunity to obtain estimates less subject to severe measurement error, given that changes in taxation induce firms to reevaluate their investment levels in order to reflect the new economic environment. The analysis of investment can shed light on how constant capital expenditures are across time, and thus help design imputation strategies for nonresponse in capital expenditures survey questions.

These objectives will be accomplished by linking an external dataset of establishments receiving business assistance between 1999 and 2007 to census datasets. The project uses the external dataset of business assistance recipients to both validate and improve the quality of census data. The data will be used to identify limitations of the census sampling frame, measure data quality, estimate nonresponse bias, and improve imputations for nonresponse in census datasets. The business assistance dataset is valuable because it contains data at the same level of resolution and contains some of the same data elements as census datasets. The project uses the linked datasets to explore determinants of establishment productivity not currently measured in census datasets. Specifically, the research explores how manufacturing establishment performance is affected by business assistance and how the effects vary across measurable dimensions. The analysis focuses on business assistance provided by the National Institute of Standards and Technology's Manufacturing Extension Partnership between 1999 and 2007. The project employs a variety of econometric approaches, primarily relying on an instrumental variables approach to estimate how measures of establishment performance such as productivity, output, and employment growth are affected by different types and levels of business assistance. Access to the census datasets is required to provide a valid control group and to provide key performance and control variables for this analysis. This study analyzes the link between the characteristics of firms' labor forces (the human factor) and corporate restructuring decisions, such as plant closure and acquisitions. Specifically, it will analyze whether the labor composition and the wage structure of a plant or firm affects its probability of being shut down or of becoming a takeover target, and how factors such as experience, human capital, and wages explain the cross-sectional differences in worker retention decisions and firm performance following an acquisition or plant closure. worker statistics, such as those produced by the LEHD program. Moreover, since the SDC data documents the time when restructuring becomes effective in the legal sense and census databases record the time when real changes are made (in terms of labor and capital), comparing these two sources will provide valuable information on the length of the integration process. Statistics on the changes in workforce composition and the change in the wage distribution after restructuring will be produced. Econometric models will estimate the effects of employee characteristics and the wage distribution on the likelihood of plant closure or takeover. .

This paper seeks to add to the existing evidence in the health literature by studying how education is associated with both positive and negative health behaviors. In addition to conducting a two-stage least squares analysis, which uses changes to state statutes regarding school entry and compulsory schooling laws, the proposed study will also examine a reduced-form method to determine how changes to compulsory schooling laws that increase the length of time adolescents stay in school affected their health behaviors.

As has been widely documented, blood lead levels have declined dramatically in U.S. children since the 1970s. Concern remains over additional sources of lead, most prominently in remaining lead paint in older homes and remaining environmental lead exposure. However, in the past year, numerous reports of imported toys containing lead or lead paint led to several publicized recalls and elicited concern from parents, particularly over toys imported from China (which accounted for 80 percent of the U.S. toy market in 2006). This project aims to explore the actual health impact of imported toys, which has received little attention.

Specifically, it exploits the sharp discontinuity in school enrollment generated by kindergarten eligibility laws, which are determined at the state-level. Children born just before the cutoffs will on average be young for their age, while children born just after the cutoff must, on average, wait a year to enter school, and therefore, will be the oldest children in their class.

Increasingly, this information is being demanded in the form of small area statistics to monitor health trends and support policy decisions in small geographic areas, including those that are typically underrepresented in large-scale data collection projects. However, the CDC is often prevented from releasing small area identifiers in publicuse datasets because the data do not satisfy certain disclosure restrictions. This research tests and evaluates a new method for generating public-use micro-level datasets that contain enough geographical detail to permit small area estimation without compromising the confidentiality of survey respondents. The method uses the observed survey data to fit a statistical imputation model that generates synthetic data records, which comprise the public-use data records. The synthetic data are generated to emulate the observed data and preserve important statistical properties of the observed data. Moreover, the synthetic data can account for the hierarchical clustering structure associated with multiple levels of geography; thus, permitting data users to perform various geographical analyses with a single dataset. Confidentiality protection is greatly enhanced because no actual data values are released to the public.

The goal of this study is to characterize geographic variations in hypertension disparities within the United States. More specifically, the research intends to determine whether or not Black-White disparities in hypertension prevalence vary by county and if this variation is due to differences in racial residential segregation. The working hypothesis is that racial residential segregation will be associated with larger disparities in hypertension prevalence by concentrating neighborhood deprivation in predominantly Black neighborhoods. If residential segregation is associated with increased disparities in hypertension, then policies and interventions at the county level to promote the integration of neighborhoods, and the more equitable distribution of resources and services to low income neighborhoods, could potentially reduce hypertension disparities."}, {"section_title": "DOES THE PROFITABILITY OF AN OUTPATIENT SURGERY INFLUENCE WHERE IT IS PERFORMED?
