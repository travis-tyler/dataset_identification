It is considered to be one of the most serious bioterrorist threats. Variola virus can spread from person to person by respiratory droplets or direct contact with body fluids. The infectious dose is small with a high fatality rate. Various vaccinia virus strains such as EM-63, Lister, Temple of Heaven, Western Reserve and New York City Board of Health (NYCBH) strains have been used as successful vaccines. [1] [2] [3] However, international health care authorities are concerned about the intentional release of variola virus. This has prompted researchers around the world to study the level of immunity in current populations. 4 Hammarlund et al. evaluated the duration of antiviral immunity after smallpox vaccination. 5 More than 90% of volunteers vaccinated 25-75 years ago still maintain immunity against vaccinia virus. Vaccinia-specific neutralizing (Nt) antibody titer was used to estimate the immunity provided by smallpox vaccination. 6 Taub et al. also examined the magnitude and duration of antiviral antibody immunity conferred by smallpox vaccination in participants of the National Institute on Aging Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. 7 These individuals showed the persistence of relatively stable vaccinia IgG titers for periods up to 88 years after the initial vaccination. Moreover, the vaccinia-specific Nt antibody titer ranged from 1:256 to 1:512 and remained stable. Putz et al. reported long-lasting antibody with similar titers against vaccinia virus in citizens aged between 30 and 100 years old. 8 Liu et al. demonstrated that vaccinia-specific Nt antibody was maintained for more than 40 years post vaccination in a Chinese population. 9 The plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) is the standard method for studying anti-viral Nt antibody. 10 Several studies have used this assay to investigate antibody level after smallpox vaccination in volunteers. [7] [8] [9] In our study, the final Nt antibody titers were assessed in sera of Thai individuals of different ages who had been immunized with smallpox vaccine during childhood. The results indicate the length of time that Thai individuals can maintain Nt antibody against smallpox virus. This information should be useful for public health strategies against potential bioterrorism threats."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Serum", "text": "A batch of 1,200 leftover sera obtained randomly from either healthy individuals or patients during 2013 by the Department of Microbiology was analyzed with approval from the Siriraj Institutional Review Board (SIRB), Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University.

The maintenance of long-term antibody responses is critical for protective immunity against many pathogens. Although both humoral and cellular immunities are long-lived after vaccinia virus immunization, 5, 13 the last smallpox fatality in 1978 in Birmingham, England, occurred despite the patient having been previously vaccinated twice; first as a child and again aged 28.\n14 Due to concerns about the risk of bioterrorist activity involving the intentional release of variola virus, several countries have evaluated the immune response to smallpox/vaccinia virus remaining in their population. 5, 7, 9 The last smallpox vaccination with the Lister strain in Thailand occurred in 1977/1978. 15 Thus, we investigated the remaining humoral immunity, i.e., neutralizing antibody, to smallpox/vaccinia virus in a Thai population born before 1979. In this study, the levels and duration of NtAb in Thai individuals at a variety of ages were examined by PRNT. Initially, the optimal incubation time of the neutralization step of PRNT was investigated. We compared the serum-virus mixtures for the standard 1 h vs 15 h incubation at 37\u00baC/ 5%CO 2 . Pre-and post-vaccination sera of a volunteer who received the ACAM2000 TM smallpox vaccine as a primary immunization were examined. Interestingly, the 15 h incubation demonstrated a much higher serum PRNT titer than the 1 h incubation. In addition, the vaccinee demonstrated successful vaccination via the presence of a major cutaneous reaction at the inoculation site. However, the 1 h incubation did not produce a positive Nt antibody response. A 1 h incubation may not have been long enough for the serum to bind to the virus completely in this study. This showed that the longer the incubation time, the higher the sensitivity of the assay.\nOur result confirms a study by Newman et al., who reported the superiority of the 15 h incubation of the serum-virus mixture compared to the standard 1 h incubation. 11 However, Katz reported that PRNT titers determined following a 2 h, 37\u00baC virus-serum incubation period did not differ significantly from those determined following an 18 h incubation period (2 h, 37\u00baC incubation followed by a 16 h, 4\u00baC incubation period). 16 Thus, we chose this 15 h incubation period for further study of PRNT titers in all sera.\nBased upon reports from the smallpox pre-eradication period, an anti-vaccinia Nt antibody titer of >20 or >32 was protective. [17] [18] We used a titer of \u226532 as a cut off for positive NtAb. Thus, positive NtAb were detected in 135 (11.25%) of 1200 sera: 81 male sera (6.75%) and 54 female sera (4.5%). All six groups of individuals of different ages showed the maintenance of NtAb against vaccinia virus. However, there were some differences in the final NtAb titers among these groups. Interestingly, the sera from older groups (group 5: aged \u226575-84 and group 6: aged \u226585) showed a higher number of positive NtAb than those of the other four groups, i.e., 16.5-26.0% vs 2.0-9.5%, respectively. The low number of positive NtAb presenting in total and the increase in number of positive NtAb sera with increasing age were concordant with a previous study in China by Liu et al. , who investigated the NtAb in the general population. 9 They reported that the overall percentage of positive NtAb in their study was 7.6% (21/278) and increased with age, i.e., 5.56% (9/162) vs 10.35% (12/116) of 31-40 and 41-56 years, respectively. In addition, a study by Hatakeyama et al. in Japan demonstrated that 80% of persons born before 1969 and 50% of those born between 1969 and 1975 had maintained Nt antibodies against smallpox. 19 Nt antibodies have been revealed to decline substantially during a 5-10 year period after natural smallpox infection or vaccination. [20] [21] Thus, individuals who received the recommended single-dose vaccination during childhood may not have lifelong immunity. The percentage of individuals retaining long-term vaccinia-specific antibodies was lower among individuals who were vaccinated once, compared with individuals who received multiple vaccinations. [22] [23] It is possible that in our study, most people in the younger age groups (groups 1-4) had received only one single-dose vaccine while most people in the older age groups (groups 5-6) had received more than one dose. Moreover, the duration and times of exposure to natural smallpox of the older age groups during the era of circulating smallpox may have been longer/higher than those of the younger age groups. Repeated exposure to smallpox could result in subclinical infection that may have continued to boost immunity over time. 5 In our study the oldest individual with NtAb-positive serum (1:128) was a 98-year-old female. This indicates that NtAb could be maintained for more than 90 years after the initial vaccination. This is consistent with a study conducted in Baltimore, USA, in which vaccinia-specific IgG were found to remain for a period of up to 88 years post vaccination. 7 NtAb responses to smallpox/vaccinia virus vaccine may be related to many factors including the host's genetic make-up, the strain of vaccinia virus in the vaccine, the dose of vaccine, the times of vaccination, age, gender, etc. In our study, males (81/135; 60%) were significantly more likely to have NtAb (p-value = 0.001) than females (54/135; 40%). On the other hand, Liu et al. reported no statistically significant association between gender and the presence of NtAb, i.e., 12/21 males (57.14%) vs 9/21 females (42.86%) in Chinese individuals. 9 In conclusion, the durability of immunity to vaccinia/ smallpox vaccine in the Thai population is lifelong for older individuals (>74 years old) who were successfully vaccinated on more than one occasion or were exposed to circulating smallox in the smallpox era. However the majority of the younger Thai population (\u226535-74 years old) is highly susceptible to infection.\n96-and 91-years-old, respectively. The oldest individual whose serum had a positive NtAb titer at 128 was a 98-year-old female.\nOne hundred sera of non-vaccinated individuals aged from \u226411, 12-21 and 22-31 years old were examined for NtAb titers. No positive NtAb titers were identified as shown in Table 3 ."}]
