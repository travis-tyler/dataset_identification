[{"section_title": "", "text": "A first step in understanding more about students receiving special education in the primary grades (kindergarten through third grade) is a basic description of the timing and duration of special education services provided over these grades, including when students first receive special education, for how long, and how the timing and duration of special education may differ by the demographics of students and the school settings in which students are served: In what grades or combinations of grades do students receive special education in the primary grades? Are there differences in the timing and duration of special education for girls and boys? Students of different racial/ethnic backgrounds? Poor and nonpoor students? Students in public and private schools? Students in different regions of the country or in urban and rural schools? Students in schools that serve higher and lower percentages of poor students? Recent data released by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-99 (ECLS-K) allow a study of the provision of special education services in U.S. public and private schools over the years between kindergarten and third grade. Through the ECLS-K, NCES has followed a nationally representative sample of school children who were in kindergarten in the 1998-99 school year through 2003-04, when most children in the sample were in fifth grade. This Issue Brief focuses on the primary grades and uses special education data collected in spring 1999 (kindergarten), 2000 (first grade), and 2002 (third grade). Issue Brief point, a school administrator provided information on whether a student received special education services. The school administrator also reported information on characteristics of the school, such as school sector, the proportion of students in the school eligible for free or reduced-price lunch through the National School Lunch Program, and the setting of the school neighborhood. Parents were asked about the student's sex and race/ethnicity, as well as questions about household size and income that could then be used to determine the student's poverty status. 3 The Issue Brief presents the percentage of students receiving special education in at least one of the three grades (kindergarten, first grade, and third grade). Then, among students who received special education in at least one of the grades, the Issue Brief presents information on which of the three grades students first received services and the combinations of grades in which students received them. Results are reported separately by sex, race/ethnicity, student's poverty status, school sector (public or private), the urbanicity and region of the school, and the poverty concentration of the school (schools were coded \"high poverty\" if at least 50 percent of students were eligible for free or reduced-price lunch through the National School Lunch Program)."}, {"section_title": "Findings", "text": "Overall, 12 percent of students received special education services in kindergarten, first, or third grade (table 1). 4 Males were more likely than females to receive special education in at least one grade (16 vs. 8 percent). Poor students were more likely than nonpoor students to receive services (18 vs. 10 percent). Also, higher percentages of public school rather than private school students (14 vs. 3 percent), students in small town/rural rather than central city schools (15 vs. 10 percent), and students in the South or Northeast rather than the West (15 and 13 percent vs. 9 percent) received special education in at least one grade. In the primary grades, the most common entry to special education occurred after first grade (that is, students received services in third grade but not in kindergarten or first grade). Among students who received special education in at least one grade, 43 percent received special education in third grade but not in kindergarten or first grade, 34 percent began receiving services in kindergarten, and 23 percent began in first grade. This later entry was more prevalent among males (46 percent received in third grade but not kindergarten or Table 1. Percentage of the kindergarten class of 1998-99 receiving special education in kindergarten, first, and third grade, by student and school characteristics: 1998-99, 1999-2000, and 2001-02 Among special education students "}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "This analysis of the timing and duration of special education in the primary grades illustrates the complexity of the growth of the special education population between kindergarten and third grade. Overall in the U.S. kindergarten class of 1998-99, higher percentages of students began receiving special education after first grade than in kindergarten or first grade. Of those who entered special education in kindergarten, about one half were no longer receiving special education in third grade. Conversely, those who entered special education in first grade were more likely than not to be receiving special education again in third grade. Patterns in the timing and duration of special education in these grades differed by sex, racial/ethnic background, poverty status, and the sector and geographic setting of their schools. Whether or not the third grade special education students continue to receive services will not be clear until future years of ECLS-K data are analyzed. The ECLS-K is scheduled to follow children through the cohort's eighth grade year. first grade) than females (37 percent). Also special education students included in the Other/more than one race, non-Hispanic racial/ethnic category were more likely than Black special education students to receive services in third grade but not the two earlier grades (53 vs. 36 percent). Higher percentages of special education students in central cities (55 percent) and urban fringes/large towns (44 percent) than small towns/rural areas (29 percent) received special education in third grade but not the earlier grades. And, a higher percentage of special education students in the West (59 percent) than in the South (37 percent) received special education in third grade but not the earlier grades. Students who received special education services in kindergarten did not necessarily continue with special education in later grades. Thirty-three percent did not receive special education in first or third grades and another 16 percent received special education in first but not in third grade. This means that about half (49 percent) of students who received special education in kindergarten had stopped receiving special education by third grade. Among Hispanic students who received special education in kindergarten, 48 percent received services only in kindergarten, a higher percentage than the other racial/ethnic groups. Also, in the West, 58 percent of kindergartners receiving special education received services in kindergarten only, a higher percentage than in the other regions. In contrast, in the Midwest, 20 percent of kindergartners receiving special education received it in kindergarten only and 48 percent received special education in all three grades (these percentages differ measurably only from the West; apparent differences with other regions cannot be confirmed because of large standard errors). Students who were new to special education in first grade were more likely than not to be receiving special education in third grade as well (56 percent of students first receiving special education in first grade). The relatively small number of students in the analytic sample who first received special education in first grade makes it difficult to draw inferences about differences among the subgroups of students-some large apparent differences are not statistically significant. However, some notable differences did emerge. For example, a higher percentage of male students than female students new to special education in first grade continued to receive services in third grade (64 vs. 42 percent). A higher percentage of Hispanic students than Black students new to special education in first grade continued to receive services in third grade (68 vs. 44 percent). And a higher percentage of students in the West than those in the South or Midwest new to special education in first grade continued to receive services in third grade (79 percent vs. 51 and 52 percent, respectively)."}]
