[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Dysmobility syndrome (DMS) was considered as a comprehensive approach to evaluate the condition of musculoskeletal system and adverse health problems in older population. The objective of our study was to examine the association between metabolic syndrome (MetS) and DMS in a U.S. adult population. 1760 eligible participants from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2002 were enrolled in the study. The criteria of DMS consisted of six domains including increased body fat, declined muscle mass, reduced muscle strength, osteoporosis, slow gait speed, and balance problem. A multivariate regression analysis was investigated to clarify the relationship among MetS and its components and DMS. A positive association between increased number of MetS components and the presence of DMS achieved significance (\u03b2 = 0.142, 95%CI = 0.035, 0.249, p = 0.009). Among the components of MetS, hyperglycemia had a central place in the DMS after adjustment of clinical variables (\u03b2 = 0.083, 95%CI = 0.030, 0.136, p = 0.002). Notably, insulin resistance assessed by homeostatic model assessment (HOMA-IR) was correlated to increased body fat (r = 0.092, p<0.05), osteoporosis (r = -0.105, p<0.05) and balance (r = 0.105, p<0.05) among these participants with MetS.

However, not only the term \"sarcopenia [1] \" but also \"osteosarcopenic obesity [2] \" only focus on the aspects of muscle, bone condition and obesity that was too narrow in both identifying people at risk of decline and to inform intervention development and implementation. Recently, dysmobility syndrome (DMS), reported by Binkley et al [3] , was a potential and developing territory to describe as a multicomponent classification which considering the interaction across such health conditions and incorporating wide range of factors to evaluate comprehensively the adverse outcomes in elderly people. Looker et al. had reported that patients with DMS had increased mortality risks among older population [4] .\nThere had been a substantial body of studies in the literature concerning the relationship among MetS, frailty, and sarcopenia. MetS was a cluster factors contributing to multiple chronic diseases and increased risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality [5] and was prevalent in U.S. adults. The presence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) played an important role in several adverse health conditions, such as low lean muscle mass, reduced muscle strength, osteoporosis, central obesity, functional dependency, and mobility limitation. To date, the research was still at an early stage in the application of DMS to clinical setting, not to mention a paucity of literature associated with MetS. In the present study, we hypothesized that MetS might contribute to the development of DMS through several underlying mechanisms.

A two-sided p-value of \ufffd 0.05 was regarded as the threshold for statistical significance. A linear regression model was performed for the association between number of MetS components and DMS, and the relationship between individual MetS component and DMS.

Notably, patients with high serum glucose had significantly associated with the existence of DMS after multimodel adjustment. No significant difference was noted between other components of MetS and DMS. HOMA-IR, a method used to quantify insulin resistance and beta-cell function, was of paramount importance with individual components of DMS. To the best of our knowledge, this study was the first to examine the association between MetS and DMS which data was derived from the large-scale population survey.\nBefore the concept of DMS, several terms were applied to accurately identify older people most at risk of serious declines in health, independence, and function. Frailty, an age-related decline in multiple physiological domains, manifested an increased vulnerability to adverse health outcomes and resulted in high risk for falls, disability, hospitalization, and mortality [14] . MetS was consider as a risk factor for occurrence of the frailty in a sample of older noninstitutionalized individuals (Table 6 ) [15] . Rosenberg et al. described the origins of the term sarcopenia that revealed important changes in body composition and related functions [16] . In the last decade, some definitions for sarcopenia had been used to facilitate diagnosis both in clinical care and the ambulatory setting. European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People recommended using the presence of low muscle mass, low muscle function and physical disability [1] . In a cross sectional study of 8570 men aged 20-75 years, inverse association between muscle strength and MetS was observed [17] . Significant relationship of low muscle mass and MetS was reported in Asian population [18] . Increased rate of mobility dysfunction was suggested to be associated with MetS [19] and a linear increase in disability might be associated with the number of MetS components in an elderly population [20] . The direct impact of MetS on increased risk of sarcopenia was investigated in community-dwelling older adults [21] . Recently, osteosarcopenic obesity, a combined concept was published to identify the concurrent incident of impaired bone condition, reduced muscle mass and strength, and increased adiposity [2] . MetS was considered to be a risk factor for developing osteoporosis in men [22] . Insulin resistance was confirmed to lead to accelerated muscle loss and implied those with diabetes were likely to present with osteosarcopenic obesity [23] . Taking the above together, the domains of DMS were included the health problems and conditions of frailty, sarcopenia and osteosarcopenic obesity. It was consistent with our findings that the presence of MetS and increased number of MetS components had positive association with DMS. Skeletal muscle was a major target of insulin and insulin receptors in the muscle played an important role in glucose regulation, and muscle is a major site of glucose disposal [24] . The development of DM and hyperglycemia had reported to be induced by obesity [25] . In a crosssectional study, hyperglycemia was significantly associated with relatively lower lean muscle mass [26] . Hyperglycemia was an imperative characteristic of lower muscle strength examining from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging data [27] . The relationship between hyperglycemia and higher levels of inflammatory factors might be considered as a plausible explanation for alternation of body composition [28] . TNF-\u03b1, an important cytokine in skeletal muscle wasting and reduced muscle function [29] , was involved with decline in grip strength and borderline associated with decline in knee extensor strength [28] . Diabetic neuropathy was a common complication in diabetes caused by hyperglycemia-induce oxidative stress in diabetic Table 4 .

It was also related to loss of foot muscle volume, muscle strength and motor dysfunction [31] . Patients with diabetes was associated with altered bone turnover and had increased risk for developing osteoporosis [32] . Chronic hyperglycemia was reported to result in bone loss by modulating osteoblast gene expression, function, and bone formation [33] . There were several underlying pathways for explaining the mechanism of bone formation loss. Wang et al. indicated that higher level of glucose could increase adipogenic and inhibit osteogenic differentiation by activating cAMP/PKA/ERK pathway in MG-63 cells then markedly suppressed cell growth, mineralization, and expression of various osteoblast-related markers [34] . A histomorphometric analysis revealed increases in osteoclast numbers and expression of osteoclastogenic mediators, including TNF-\u03b1, MCSF, RANKL and VEGF-A, which promoted osteoclastogenesis and diminished primary bone formation [35] . It was consistent with our study that hyperglycemia was significantly associated with DMS, consisted of six domains mentioned in above discussion. In the present study, HOMA-IR was correlated to body fat, osteoporosis and balance problems in subjects with MetS and low muscle mass in participants without MetS. Insulin was a catabolic hormone, which induced the process of protein degeneration and synthesis in skeletal muscle [36] . Lee et al. demonstrated the relationship between greater lean muscle mass loss and insulin resistance as assessed by HOMA-IR in men without diabetes [26] . Inverse association was noted between insulin resistance and muscle mass resulted from alteration of insulin signaling which could lead to reduced muscle synthesis [37] . A potential mechanism for the effect of insulin resistance on skeletal muscle was that increased lipid accumulation in type 2 Frailty was defined based on following criteria were present: unintentional weight loss, self-reported exhaustion, weakness (grip strength), slow walking speed, and low physical activity.\nMetS was associated with frailty. Such associations were not driven by specific altered components of MetS or by their sum."}, {"section_title": "Ishii", "text": "Assessed the associations of MetS with sarcopenia in older adults\nDiagnosis is based on documentation of criterion 1 plus (criterion 2 or criterion 3): low muscle mass, low muscle strength, low physical performance\nMetS is positively associated with sarcopenia in older men, and central obesity is the main contributor to the association across sex and age."}, {"section_title": "JafariNasabian", "text": "Osteosarcopenic obesity (OSO) syndrome and its individual components\nThe criteria for the diagnosis include the combination of its individual components: osteoporosis/osteopenia and/or osteopenic obesity, sarcopenia and/or sarcopenic obesity and increased adiposity.\nOSO syndrome was cause by dysregulation of major metabolic pathways due to pro-inflammatory factors and endocrine imbalance such as low-grade chronic inflammation and insulin resistance.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0207608.t006\ndiabetes was related to reduced oxidative enzyme capacity [38] , and defects in muscle lipid oxidation due to impaired mitochondria number or function could lead to this process. The association between insulin resistance and body fat had been reported in the past [39] . Mitochondria dysfunction was caused by insulin resistance and might contribute to free fatty acid and lipid accumulation [40] . Inflammation in adipose tissue, as suggested by the presence of macrophage in the form of crown-like structures, had been identified as a mediator of systemic insulin resistance [39] . Substantial evidence had supported that old people with DM had increased risk of fracture [41] [42] [43] . However, there were contradictory results for the association of insulin resistance and bone mineral density in patients with DM that a study reported increased bone mineral density [44] and another showed decreased [45] . In a previous study enrolled large scale Asian population, Shin et al. reported that HOMA-IR were inversely associated with BMD and osteoporosis and indicated insulin resistance was an adverse predictor for bone health [46] . Reduced bone mineral density had been represented in conditions related to insulin resistance, such as MetS [47] and increased fat mass [48] . It was compatible with our findings that HOMA-IR was correlated to osteoporosis in MetS group. Elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 as well as TNF-\u03b1 were noted in subjects with DM and might induce bone loss by stimulating osteoclast activity [49] . Recent research demonstrated that the level of myokines was involved in the muscle contraction of regular physical activity, which was considered to be released from skeletal muscle [50] . Myokines regulated the lipid and glucose metabolism, and they were associated with insulin resistance through the control of inflammation. In older population, insulin resistance was considered as not only an early biological marker, but also a predictive and modifiable marker of mobility limitation [51] . It was reasonable that impaired physical function might arise from the joint of low muscle mass, reduced muscle strength, excess adiposity and adverse bone condition. Although all efforts went into this study, there were several potential limitations should be noted. First, the present study was a cross sectional approach that no casual association between MetS and DMS. Future studies are warranted to assess the prospect by using longitudinal design with large sample size. Second, there was no muscle pathology from muscle biopsy reporting in our study, and we could not confirm the hypothesis. Third, sex difference was not analyzed during this study. Further studies should address the association of sex, MetS and DMS. Next, selection bias is existed in the present study. NHANES data are not obtained using a simple random sample. Rather, a complex, multistage, probability sampling design is used to select participants representative of the civilian, non-institutionalized US population. Oversampling of certain population subgroups is done to increase the reliability and precision of health status indicator estimates for these groups. In the present study, we included participants who had finished examinations of DMS: body composition measurement, bone mineral density measurement, gait speed test, and muscle strength measurement. There were 581 subjects with DMS and 1179 without DMS. A randomized controlled trial is needed for further research to examine the association between MetS and DMS. Finally, the generalization of the findings to other populations with different race/ethnicity may be limited."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "The present study highlighted a strong relationship between DMS and the presence of MetS and its components in elderly population. Notably, this dynamic interplay between DMS and MetS underlined the pathophysiology of insulin resistance. MetS aggravated inflammation and insulin resistance, which harbored a predisposing milieu for developing DMS. Our findings brought new insights for the development of this new field. Further researches should explore the underlying mechanisms for the clinical observations and therapeutic strategies to encounter the adverse health problems."}]
