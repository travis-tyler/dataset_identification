Personnel contains data on all PhD -level graduates from United States Universities from 1920 to the presents Since 1957, a considerable amount of detailed information has been gathered regarding each person, on a questionnaire form completed by the individual at.the time of his graduation. This file was drawn upon, on the initiative and with the support of the United States Office of Education, for the present report.on doctorate-holders in linguistics and modern foreign languages. The DOCTORATE RECORDS data did not contain all the information needed for this study, however, particularly with respect to language fields (no break -out by languages is maintained routinely) and with respect to higher education experience which did not result in the award of a degree. Beth of these kinds of information were needed for the study, so an arrangement was made with the Center For AppEed Linguistics to examine the original Doctorate Survey forms and code from them the additional data needed. This was done bit*. Charles Zisa of the Center For Applied Linguistics. Language groups, and foreign areas (based on indigenous language) which he set up are shown in the appendix. Originally, there were 1051 doctorate-holders of the years 1957 through 1961, inclusive, which had been ceded by the Office of Scientific Personnel as having majors in the two fields of Linguistics and Modern Foreign Languages. This coding was based very largely on the individual's own self-classification at the time he was awarded the doctorate. Upon scrutiny by the Center For Applied Linguistics, a number of these cases were discarded as not really being in the field' of linguistics or modern foreign languages but being essentially English (rather than English linguistics). There are a number of borderline cases in which a decision on categorization is a matter of judgment; in the present study the judgment of the linguists was relied upon. The final result was a total of 991 cases, divided into 116 linguists and 875 modern foreign language specialists. For certain parts of the study, all the modern foreign language specialists could be combined, although they were kept distinct from the linguists. For other parts of the study, a break-out into separate language fields was of the essence. It was found that in fact, there were very few language majors in fields other than the Indo-European languages, a total of 24 being found in all African and Asiatic languages. This included 4 Hebrew, 4 Japanese, 5 Chinese, and 11 in all other Asian Over the five years of this study, the output of doctorates was practically constant, except for 1957, for which Doctorate Survey forms were incomplete, as the survey procedure was not introduced until some 1957 graduates had left the campus. Table 1 gives the number of graduates in each field and field group for each year and the five-year total. Table 1 Doctorates in Linguistics andVarious Modern Foreign Languages, 1957-1961 Year Because there appeared to be no significant time -trend$ in output, as shown in Table 1, thedata to follow will combine all five years, in most instances. It is of irterest to follow in somewhat more detail the fields of specialization of these people at other career stages, including major and minor fields at the undergraduate and master's level, doctorate minor, and field of doctorate dissertation. Table 2 shows the general fields of bachelor's and master's degrees, as coded by. the Office. of Scientific Personnel . In this table, all foreign language fields are conbiied, as noted earlier. A detailed break-out within the language fields is provided.ky Table 3, which is derived from the coding done by Mr. Use of the Center For.Applied Linguistics. Here, it is to be noted, the snmolanguage fields are lumped into * category \"other\" which comprises the fields broken out ingots detail by the O.S.P. coding. The two sets of data are thus supplementary. Expanded tables showing the relation of doctorate specialization to earlier fields of specialization are given in, Tables 3 and 4.  Table 3 provides informationLonnsjor and minor fields of specialization-at the bachelor's and waster's levels, for each language and linguistics' field at the doctorate level. Table 4 uses the Sane doctorate field briaks and presents data on field of doctorate minor and field of dissertation. In following the trends from level to level, it is possible to trace, out aninCrissing degree of specialization. It is also apparent at all levels thatthe African a$ Asian languages are studied by. very for people. , . Pre-Doctorate Yields.  If the schools producing doctorates in languages and linguistics are divided into three groups, each responsible for one .third of the doctorates, there are fivi schools in the top group, ten in the middle group, and 46 in the lotto* group. The five leaders are Columbia with 104, Michigan with 61, Yale with 60, Bursa with 56, and the University of California at Berkeley with 52. The next .10, including three private schools producing a total of 94 PhD's and seven public a:Walt producing 227 PhD's, turn out from 19 to 45 each. These schools, with the sober of doctorates each produced, are Wisconsin (45), Indiana (43), Pennsylvania. (42), North Carolina (39), Texas (30), New York University (29), University of California at Los Angeles (26), Illinois (25), Cornell (23), and University of Washington (19). The smallest producers, with one to 18 graduates each, comprise 17 public .institutions producing 113 graduates and 29 private institutions producing 224. Included in the latter groups are three Catholic schools with a total of 21 graduates. In all, there are 26 public schools with an average of 17.8 PhD's each, 32 private nondenominational schools with 'an average of 16.1 PhD's per school, and the three Catholic schools with an average of seven each. The latter group is too 'small for independent analysis, and is hereinafter combined with the other private, institutions. Plaster's-Producing 'Institutions. Going 'back one step to the master's level, it is to be noted that. 127 of these PhD's did not take Mk degrees, but went directly from It to PhD. The 864 with MA's included 64 students from 33 foreign institutions with from one to seven graduates each. Canada leads the list with eight schools producing. 23 M&'s who vent on to the doctorate in languages or linguistics over the five-year period of this report. Two Xd.can institutions, the National Autonomous University of Mexico, with seven MA's and Mexico City College with six MA's, are the highest individual producers. The othelr schools, -with only 1. or 2 ifk's each, are located as follows: Europe 14, India (4), Lebanon (1), Australia (1), and New Zealand (1). In al1028 of the 64 foreign Ilk's were earned in English-speaking countries, with four more from India, where English is in fact the commou language. Master's degrees of United States origin include 800 from 110 different institutions granting up to 78 degrees each 'to individuals in the analysis group. The ten leaders here are Columbia (78), Michigan (41), Harvard (36)9 Wisconsin (36)0 Middlebury College (35), Berkeley (32), Indiana (28), Yale (26), Pennsylvania (22), -7and North Carolina (20). The next dozen, with ten or mere each, are Chicago (19), Illinoic (18), NYU 17, Iowa 17, UCLA (16), Texas (15), Radcliffe (a4). 14, Princeton (12), Minnesota (11), Johns Hopkins (10),and Ohio. State (10), There were 33 institutions granting only one MA each, and 20 granting only 2 each to members of this in:oup, The geogrirphic spread of the MA granting inetitutions is indicated by the following regional summary, in, which the regional name is followed by two numbers, the umber of institutions and the number of degrees; New England (13, 135), Middle Atlantic (18, 185), rut North Central (17, 175), West North Central (9,55), South Atlantic (16, 81), East South Central (8, 24), West South Central (12; 41), Mountain (6, 23), and Pacific (11,81). Thus the schools. in the three northeastern regions averages 10.3 MA's each to this doctorate group, while in the rest of the country combined the average was 4.9 NA's per school, with a range from 3.0 to 7,4,"}, {"section_title": "University of Washington", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Baccalaureate Origins", "text": "Baccalaureate origins are .of course latch more numerous' than Master's schools, The 177 foreign bachelor's degrees include 42 from 11 Canadian schools, 16 from 8 Latin Avarice* schools; and 95 from 53 European schools, From all the rest of the world come only 17 students from 14 schools, and of these eleven cone frok. Australia, New Zealand, and the Philippines where English is the COMM language. The European groups include six students from five schools in England and Scotland and 14 students from eight schools in Eastern Europe, The only foreign sources of sore than four students each are McGill (5), University of Toronto (7), University of Western Ontario (7), University of British. Columbia (8), and the 80r11011113 (13). There were seven students in all whose baccalaureate Origin could not be pin-pointed. Within the United States, the leading schools (those with more than ten Ws each) included Bayard (27), 'Tale (22), Bcckeley (22), Wisconsin 21 IITIT (14), Pennsylvania (13),. and the Irniversitrof Washington (12). The regional distribution of the baccalaureate sources, and the numbers of studilota from each of the schools, by region, are indicated in Table 5 on the following page. -80 Inasmuch as most of these people obtained their baccalaureate degrees in United States institutions, it is of interest to trace them back further, to see whether any substantial number of them were originally of foreign origin, and, among those from the Unitaci States, the regions and states of secondary education. It is found that, in fact, 234 of this group biaf their secondary education abroad, as compared with 177 with foreign baccalaureate-level training. Within the United States, the regional distribution of high schools of origin is as follows; New England (81), Middle Atlantic (225), East North Central (122), West North Central (55), South Atlantic (69), East South Central (27), West 'South Central (27), Mountain 25, and Pacific (61). The proportional distribution within the United States therefore rather closely parallels the proportional distribution of baccalaureate origins. The high schools of origin of 65 people are unknown. Information is available on the sizes of the high school classes, and mode of control, Limited comparisons can be made with data for the U.S. as a whole, based on the high school graduating class of '1951. Thii is so hat later than the typical' graduation year for the language and linguistics doctOrates in the present stu4,init prolly the changes over time are not such as to invalidate the comparison., In Table 6. is shown the distribution of high sChOol araduating classes for the linguists and the modern foreign laaguage groups separate* There is no statistical difference here, so the two groups are combined, and the percentage distribution for the Combined group is compared with the typical. 'class Size distribution for the U.S. as a wha1e, as derived from tabulations of the data in the Directori of Secondary. /fay, Schools, 19504951, published by Ale U.S. Office of lklueition. This compiXison .shown in Table 6. It is apparent from the right-hand column of Table 6 that the Languages and Linguistics doctorates are more numerous than expected in the smaller classes. (those of less than 40) and in the largest classes (those over 200), while there are fewer than ciipected in the middle-sized graduating classes . Although the percentage differences are not large a x2 test is significant at the .001 level, It is quite possible, or indeed highly probable, that this iv linked to a companion finding regarding .mode of control. Among the doctorate-holders in the present group, 23% graduated from private and denagnational schow.s. This compares. ompares with 12;3% in the \".mOn-public\" category among all U.S. high school graduates of 1951, even though the \"non-public\" category is somewhat broader than just the independent and den min-:, &timial schools: it includes university and teachers' college high schools, which are publicly-supported but not under the control of the local boards of education. The \"non-public\" schoola are in general smaller than the public schools, and hence an abnormally high percentage from this category would, be reflected in the smaller class sizes, as is actually shown in Table 6, On the other hand, it has been found that the larger schools (over 200 per graduating class)have.among their graduates::_ a much higher proportion of eventual. doctorate-holders than is typical of the smaller schools in general, combining both public and non-public categories. Hence a proportion larger than for the U.S. as a whole from the schools of 200 or more per, class is in line with previous findings. Place of birth of these doctorate-holders is of interest, particularly because of the probability of greater interest in languages on the part of those whose native tongue was other than English. It is found, in fact, that 306 or 31.4% of those whose birthplace is known. (15 cases are unknown) wwe born outside the United States. This compares with a general average for all fields combined of 16.9% for the same period. In the Arts & Professions group, of which this is a sub-group the percentage of foreign born vas only 13.9% *. Place of birth of this foreiger born group was tabulated by general area, and compared with the distribution of places of birth of 1957-61 doctorates in general. The casparison.is not enact, as the latter group, as described in MSIUtC Publication 1142, were. peOple Who were born outside the U.S. and who also had foreign secOndari education. This additional restriction is not felt, however, to account for the difference in regime/ .distribuy. tion of places of birth shown in Table 7 The differences in the Language and Linguistics distribution, as cowered with either that of all docterateAolders, or only with others in the Arts & Professions field, is clearly significant. The European background of this group is such sore dominant than is that of doctorate holders in other fields. This is no doubt the reason. for the tendency to specialize in the languages of Europe, particularly western Europe, to the neglect of all other language groups."}, {"section_title": "Foreign Area Higher Educational Raperience", "text": "Many of these doctorate-holders have had higher education in foreign areas without earning degrees there, and hence experience which is not revealed through the tabulation of MA's and BA's.

"}, {"section_title": "Age", "text": "Age at doctorate is a reflection of a great number of factors, including such things as amount of predoctoral experience, existence of adequate support during the college and graduate school years, academic ability, and the normal customs and practices in a given field. In the tables that follow, age has been analyzed rather thoroughly for the linguists and the modern foreign language specialists separately. In order to determine whether there are significant differences between the various schools and school groups, the graduates of the various doctorate -granting institutions have been considered separately..eich of the leading five schools, the public and private schools among the next ten, all public and all private schools combined, and all schools of both classes combined. Finally, the several years of doctotate have been analyzed separately, public vs. private schools, and combined, Age at master's degree, as well as age at baccalaureate and doctorate, has been computed for each of the above-mentioned groups. This does yield valuable information on the time lapse us15-. between the baccalaureate and doctorate degrees; it should.be noted, however, that it is not valid to draw conclusions from the smaller groups, and that computation of IAA& and MAAPhD time lapses will MOT yield separate figures which can validly be added to give total BAp.PhD time lapse., This is true because of the fact that many people did not stop for the MA degree along the way. The totals for those who did are not representative for the whole group. The numbers of cases in each of the groups analyzed for age trends are given in Table 11 below.  In examining the table of graduation gee of the linguists, it is noteworthy that at the BA level, the men are older than the 170113en by about 23 months, overall. At this level, the public school graduates, both male and female, are older than their counterparts in the private institutions; the average difference for an and women combined is approximately 17 months. At the MA level, this put:olio-private differential has increased to almost three years, but the men (in public and private institutions combined) are at this point only 10 months oldir than the women, on the.aversge. A caution should be noted here, however: because not all individuals take MA degrees, this may be due in part to selective sampling rather than educational processes. At the doctorate level, the men are on the average younger than the women by 21 months. This is not a sampling difference; it is a fact that the total elapsed time between the BA and PhD degrees in this field is 3% years longer for the women than for the men. Although younger at the baccalaureate level, the women are older at the doctorate. In modern foreign languages lit similar sex difference is in evidence. At the baccalaureate level the women are 15 months younger, on the average, than the men. But at the MA level they are equal, and at the doctorate the men are 20 months younger than the women, for a total BAPhD time lapse close to three years limn. In contrast to the linguists, the public school graduates arc younger than the graduates of the private institutions. The difference, though small, is consistent at the BA, MA, and PhD levels for the women and at the BA and PhD levels for the men. When the leading institutions are compared with the others, there is a small and not entirely consistent trend for younger ages at the more productive schools. This trend is not at all evident in the case of the linguists; that differences there may be are overwhelmed by the differences between private and public institutions. %en time trends are examined, there seams to be no consistent trend over the five-year period covered by this report, for either the linguists or the language specialists. Some of the smaller groups, as for one field or one sex, may seem to show a trend, but these differences are probably well within the range of random sampling variations, given the small lumbers of cases, and in the absence of any consistent trend, probably should be ignored. When the two general fields are compared, it is seen that the linguists are very slightly younger (about three months) at the baccalaureate level; there is no difference at the MA level, and at the PhD level the linguists are 1% years younger. This probably reflects differences is the typical and expected education and job ,1 experience patterns in the two fields, although in the absence of evidence it is not possible to rule out other factors, such, as possible academic ability differences."}, {"section_title": "Bk-PhD Tine Lapse", "text": "By ignoring the data regarding the natterss degrees, and subtracting ase at BA. from age at PhD, it is possible to study directly the l9-PhD tine-lapse data for the various field, sex, and institution groups: These data are tabulated in Table 14 below.

The Use lapse difference between men and men has already been discussed. Table 14 shows that the time lapse for the linguists is less than that of the language specialists by store than year; this is undoubtedly statistically significant. 7r -a difference between public and private institutions is somewhat ambiguous in the case of the linguists; in the case of the modern foreign language group the difference of sore than a year ie certainly significant.

This information is summarized in Tables 16 cad 17 on the following page. It is of considerable interest to note in Table 16 that the linguists were in far larger proportion going. abroad.

A such larger proportion of the linguists are planning to work in non-profit institutions (other than educational).
