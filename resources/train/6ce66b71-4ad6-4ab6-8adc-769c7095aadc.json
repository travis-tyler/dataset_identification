The pathology of PSP is centred on the structural microtubule associated protein tau, encoded by the MAPT gene located on chromosome 17. In PSP there is neuronal and glial accumulation of hyper-phosphorylated fibrillary aggregates of 4-repeat (4R) predominant tau. The pathological hallmarks of PSP include a high density of neurofibrillary tangles and neuropil threads in the basal ganglia and brainstem along with tau-positive tufted astrocytes (2) . Richardson's syndrome (RS) is the most common clinical phenotype related to PSP pathologyfirst described by Steele, Richardson and Olszewski as a levodopaunresponsive akinetic-rigid syndrome with falls, a vertical supranuclear gaze palsy and dementia (3) . Previous studies looking at the natural history of RS have shown that the mean age of disease onset is 65-67 years, and the median disease duration is 6-7 years (4). In addition, a clinical diagnosis of RS has been shown to be highly predictive of underlying PSP pathology (5) , and the diagnosis of this form of PSP was operationalised in the NINDS-SPSP criteria (6) . In recent years, we and others have identified alternative clinical phenotypes (7, 8) related to PSP-pathology in relatively small case series. This led to the description of two distinct PSP non-RS clinical phenotypes: PSP-Parkinsonism (PSP-P) (9) ; and Pure Akinesia with Gait Freezing (PAGF) (10) . Both studies showed that PSP-P and PAGF have a similar age of disease onset to RS, clinically resemble RS in the latter stages of disease and have a significantly longer mean disease duration (PSP-P = 9 years; PAGF = 13 years). The basis for this clinical variation related to a core pathology is unknown. PSP clinical subtypes have been related to the regional distribution and severity of pathogenic tau accumulation and neuronal loss (11) . Although post-mortem remains the gold standard for diagnosing PSP, recent publication of new diagnostic criteria from the Movement Disorder Society (MDS) PSP study group (12) highlight the presence of PSP-P and PAGF along with other PSP clinical phenotypes relating to underlying PSP pathology including PSP-corticobasal (PSP-CBS) (13) and PSP-frontal (PSP-F) subtypes (14) . A recent comprehensive genome wide association study (GWAS) involving 1,114 pathologically confirmed PSP cases and 3,247 controls was carried out to identify common risk variants for PSP. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that passed a significance cut off point of p\u226410\u207b\u00b3 were subsequently genotyped in a validation cohort that consisted of 1,051 clinically diagnosed PSP cases and 3,560 controls. Loci at MAPT (H1 haplotype and H1c sub-haplotype), MOBP, STX6 and EIF2AK3 were associated with PSP (15) . It is widely anticipated that differences in the clinico-pathological phenotypes of tauopathies may relate to differences in the strain properties of toxic tau species (16) . Here we use a large clinico-pathological cohort based on the latest MDS diagnostic criteria to show that the clinical phenotype of PSP relates in part to genetic variants which determine regional susceptibility."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study design and participants", "text": "All patients gave written informed consent for the use of their medical records and blood/brain tissue for research purposes, including the analysis of DNA.

Cases that did not have the above clinical information available were excluded from the study. Exclusion criteria used in the MDS diagnostic criteria were not considered as the presence of alternative diseases would have been identified at post-mortem. Using the MDS diagnostic criteria, each case was assigned an initial and final clinical phenotype (12) . This was based on the clinical features documented in clinical letters in the first 3 years from motor symptom onset and the clinical features documented in clinical letters in the last 2 years of life. We focused on three clinical phenotypes of interest: RS, PSP-P and PAGF; and only assigned these phenotypes if their corresponding \"probable\" criteria were fulfilled. Cases were assigned a diagnosis of 'unclassified' if there was insufficient evidence from the clinical notes to assign one of the phenotypes of interest. In cases where there was an overlap of clinical phenotype features, a consensus decision was made to assign the most appropriate clinical phenotype. The same clinical data, as above, was collected on clinically diagnosed PSP cases using their PROSPECT-UK study clinical assessments. To ensure accuracy in assigning a phenotype, living subjects were only included if their latest clinical assessment was carried out at least 3 years after motor symptom onset. In addition, cases were excluded from analyses if they had the presence of any MDS diagnostic exclusion criteria or if they fulfilled both MDS criteria for one of our PSP phenotypes of interest as well as Armstrong criteria for probable CBS as these subjects may have underlying Corticobasal Degeneration (CBD) pathology (17) ."}, {"section_title": "Genotyping and quality control", "text": "All pathologically diagnosed cases had DNA extracted from frozen brain tissue (cerebellum or frontal cortex).

MAGMA tests the joint association of all SNPs in a gene with the phenotype while accounting for linkage disequilibrium between SNPs. This presents a powerful alternative to SNP-based analyses, as it reduces the multiple testing burden and thus increases the possibility of detecting effects consisting of multiple weaker associations (20) . SNPs were mapped to genes using NCBI definitions (GRCh37/hg19, annotation release 105); only genes in which at least one SNP mapped were included in downstream analyses. These were run both with and without a window of 35 kb upstream and 10 kb downstream of each gene, as most transcriptional regulatory elements fall within this interval (21) . Furthermore, the MHC region was excluded.

Their clinical features are summarised by cohort and disease group in the table below (Table 1) . In addition, none of our cases carried known MAPT and LRRK2 (G2019S) mutations covered by the NeuroChip. After SNP imputation and data quality control, 6,215,948 common variants were included in our analysis. By assigning non-RS subjects as \"cases\" and RS subjects as \"controls\" we applied a logistic regression association analysis using gender, age at motor symptom onset, study site of subject recruitment and the first two principal components as covariates. We first carried out this analysis using data from our pathological cohort and then validated our findings using data from our independent clinical cohort before combining both datasets for a whole cohort analysis. The whole cohort analysis revealed 27 SNPs, all located on chromosome 1, which passed the threshold for genome-wide significance (p-value < 9x10\u207b\u2079). These results are summarised in Figure 1 . Population stratification was not evident in our cohort as non-European subjects were excluded from analyses as part of our genotype data quality control. This was further confirmed by obtaining a genomic inflation factor (lambda) value of 1.05. A further locus on chromosome 12 approached genome wide significance with the lead SNP (rs621042) pvalue at 7.8x10\u207b\u2077. An in-depth analysis of our significant SNPs reveal that they are all in high LD with each other (as defined by r\u00b2 > 0.80) and are all located at the chromosome 1q42.13 locus. A regional association plot ( Figure 2 ) reveals that our lead SNP, rs564309, is an intronic variant located in between exons 3 and 4 of the tripartite motif-containing protein 11 (TRIM11) gene. Alongside our directly genotyped lead SNP, the imputation quality (INFO) score for imputed significant SNPs ranged from 0.96 to 1. 96 cases from our pathological cohort underwent re-genotyping for 8 SNPs (rs564309, rs35670307, rs12065815, rs10158354, rs3795811, rs6426503, rs138782220 and rs7555298) that span the significant chromosome 1q42.13 locus. 3 of the 8 SNPs, including our lead SNP, were originally directly genotyped via the NeuroChip while the remaining 5 SNPs were originally imputed in our dataset. The p-value of these SNPs in our whole cohort GWAS ranged from 1.7x10\u207b\u2079 to 7.3x10\u207b\u2075. The results of this re-genotyping run showed 100% concordance with our original NeuroChip and imputation data. Furthermore, three of the significant SNPs that rs564309 is in LD with are non-synonymous (missense) coding variants at the Obscurin (OBSCN) gene. OBSCN is mainly expressed in skeletal muscle and may have a role in the organization of myofibrils during assembly as well as mediating interactions between the sarcoplasmic reticulum and myofibrils (27) . Related diseases include fibromuscular dysplasia and hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy.\nThe association statistics for rs564309, and the most significant flanking SNPs located at neighbouring genes, are summarised in the table below ( When referring to publically available p-value data from phase 1 of the original PSP casecontrol GWAS, we found that none of our significant SNPs reached even nominal significance (p-value <0.05). 100 European pathologically confirmed PSP cases from this GWAS underwent retrospective phenotyping according to the MDS diagnostic criteria using available clinical notes. Of those, 83 cases fulfilled probable criteria for initial clinical phenotypes of relevance to this study (PSP-RS n = 45, PSP-P n = 38). rs1188473, a SNP that was directly genotyped in the case-control GWAS, in high LD with our lead SNP (r\u00b2 1.0) and found to be significant in our phenotype GWAS (p-value 2.6x10\u207b\u2079), was shown to have similar MAFs when comparing the GWAS datasets in both RS (4% vs 6%) and non-RS (16% vs 16%) groups, therefore further validating our findings. Analysis of WES data from 65 subjects (49 RS, 16 non-RS) within our pathological cohort did not identify any non-synonymous coding variants in TRIM11 or TRIM17 genes. MAGMA analyses revealed that four genes passed genome-wide significance in analyses run with and without 35 kb upstream and 10 kb downstream of each gene (TRIM11, P = 5.64 x 10 -9 ; TRIM17, P = 8.99 x 10 -9 ; HIST3H3, P = 1.29 x 10 -8 , LOC101927401, P = 5.72 x 10 - We then used gene expression and co-expression data from BRAINEAC, GTEx and Allen Atlas databases to assess the expression profiles of genes identified in our MAGMA analysis: TRIM11, TRIM17 and HIST3H3. All three datasets revealed high levels of TRIM11 and TRIM17 expression in the brain, particularly cerebellum and putamen, whereas HIST3H3 expression appeared to be at the lower limit of detection in human brain ( Figure  4A We explored the cellular specificity of TRIM11, TRIM17 and HIST3H3 expression in human brain using data provided by the Brain RNA-seq database. This demonstrated higher neuronal expression (n = 1) of TRIM11 (0.38 FPKM) compared to both TRIM17 (0.12 FPKM) and HIST3H3 (0.10 FPKM), which was expressed at the lower limit of detection. In comparison to its neuronal expression, TRIM11 expression in glial cell types was lower (mature astrocytes 0.14\u00b10.02 FPKM, n = 12; microglia 0.12\u00b10.02 FPKM, n = 3; oligodendrocytes 0.11\u00b10.01 FPKM, n = 3). We also explored cell-specific expression of the TRIM11 and TRIM17 mouse orthologues across the brain using single cell RNA-seq data (http://dropviz.org/) generated from mouse brain tissue. This data suggested that expression of TRIM11 was highest in the spiny projection neurons (SPNs) of the striatum, with high expression in SPNs of both the \"direct\" and \"indirect\" pathways. In contrast, TRIM17 expression was generally lower with the highest expression detected in the neurons of the substantia nigra. Our colocalisation analysis did not reveal any significant associations between our GWAS signals and eQTL data in BRAINEAC and GTEx (thyroid and all brain regions) databases. However, of note, GTEx data revealed that several SNPs from the chromosome 1q42.13 locus that reached genome wide significance in our GWAS were significant eQTLs for TRIM11 and TRIM17 in skin and thyroid tissues when analysed individually."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The GWAS of clinical phenotype in PSP is a significant advance on previous studies, revealing the differential genetic contribution to PSP-RS and PSP-non-RS disorders. The data presented demonstrates that variation at the chromosome 1q42.13 locus determines clinical phenotype in PSP with a very strong effect size (odds ratio 5.55). The validity of our GWAS results is increased by the fact that similar sized association signals and minor allele frequencies were observed in two independent cohorts with a genome-wide significant association achieved when the two cohorts were combined. Furthermore, when considering the subset of MDS criteria phenotyped cases from the original PSP-case control GWAS, RS and non-RS group MAFs of directly genotyped SNPs in high LD with our lead SNP are supportive of our findings. We suspect that none of our significant SNPs reached genome wide significance in the original PSP case-control GWAS due to the fact that pathologically diagnosed PSP cases would have contained a mixture of RS and non-RS cases. When considering our data, we can infer that the combined MAFs of RS and non-RS cases would have resulted in overall PSP group MAFs that were similar to that of healthy controls. The validity of our NeuroChip genotyping and imputation were confirmed by the additional genotyping we carried out to span the chromosome 1q42.13 locus. The validity of our independent cohorts are suggested by the following: 1) In both cohorts, a majority of cases with an initial non-RS phenotype had a final clinical diagnosis of RS, as previously shown by other groups (28); 2) Our cohorts had similar MAFs for risk variants identified in the PSP case-control GWAS (15); 3) There was 100% concordance between clinical and pathological diagnoses in our clinical cohort for the subset of patients that had undergone post-mortem. MAGMA analysis confirmed signals in TRIM11, TRIM17 and HIST3H3 genes. There was evidence for differential regional brain expression of TRIM11 and TRIM17 with RNA-seq data revealing high levels of TRIM11 neuronal expression. However, it is worth noting that human neuronal expression data was based on an n number of 1 with tissue samples originating from temporal lobe, a brain region not typically severely affected by PSP pathology. In addition, it is likely that our GWAS was significantly underpowered to detect signals in our eQTL colocalisation analyses. It is important to note that SNPs within this genomic locus are in high LD, as evidenced by the spread of genome wide significant SNPs identified in our GWAS (Figure 2 ). Therefore, it is uncertain which SNP/gene is driving our association signal. However, the localisation of the lead SNP in our dataset and the gene expression profiles described above, suggest that TRIM11 is the most logical candidate gene at the chromosome 1q42.13 locus. The eQTL profile of our significant SNPs in GTEx, when analysed individually, was particularly interesting. The strong association between several SNPs in high LD with rs564309 and decreasing TRIM11 and TRIM17 expression in non-brain tissues highlight the concept of tissue/region/cell specific expression of transcripts potentially being determined by disease state and at specific time points in development or ageing (29) . However, our data does not exclude potentially important functional roles for the other transcripts within this locus. The major limitation of our study is the fact that our cohort size was relatively small compared to case-control GWAS in PSP (15) and other neurodegenerative diseases (30, 31) . We hope that further replication of our findings with larger cohorts, including other non-RS phenotypes such as PSP-F, will confirm our findings regarding the role of TRIM11 and identify genetic determinants of clinical phenotype in PSP at other loci. Furthermore, our lead SNP is an intronic variant that does not pass the FDR threshold for being a brain eQTL at the genes in our locus of interest and the only coding variants that it is in LD with are from a gene (OBSCN) that is unlikely to be of biological relevance to PSP pathology. This is a common dilemma as a majority of risk variants identified in GWAS over the past two decades are not associated with coding changes in expressed proteins (32) . Indeed, functional impacts of intronic variants may arise in modes other than gene expression, including via splicing and methylation patterns of targeted transcripts and proteins. It remains a challenge to understand the functional consequences of non-coding genetic variation linked to phenotype, and so functional studies are vital. We therefore aim to follow up this study by carrying out CRISPR/Cas-9 knockout studies in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) models of PSP to assess the impact of TRIM11 on tau biology. TRIM proteins are biologically plausible candidates as determinants of clinical phenotype in PSP and promising targets for follow up functional studies. The TRIM family of proteins, most of which have E3 ubiquitin ligase activities, have various functions in cellular processes including intracellular signalling, development, apoptosis, protein quality control, autophagy and carcinogenesis (33) . A recent study has shown that TRIM11 has a critical role in the clearance of misfolded proteins via the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS), in this case pathogenic fragments of both Ataxin-1 (Atxn1 82q) and Huntingtin protein (Httex1p 97QP) (34) . Other groups have shown that lysine residues of tau are targets for polyubiquitination which induces proteolytic degradation of tau via the UPS (35) . Furthermore, tau accumulation has been associated with decreased proteasome activity in mouse tauopathy models, suggesting a feedback loop between impaired protein degradation, aggravated by a protein aggregate based impairment of proteostasis (36) . These findings coincide with previous studies that have identified the UPS as a potential drug target in the treatment of neurodegenerative conditions (37, 38) . Overexpression of TRIM17, partly controlled by glycogen synthase kinase 3 pathways, has been shown to initiate neuronal apoptosis in cell models (39) . This was later shown to be mediated by increased degradation of the antiapoptotic protein, myeloid cell leukaemia 1 (Mcl-1), via the UPS (40) . Based on our data, we hypothesise that common variation at the chromosome 1q42.13 locus modifies the expression/function of TRIM11 to varying degrees in specific brain regions. This may lead to decreased degradation of toxic tau species via the UPS and therefore selective vulnerability to tau pathology. Profound decreases in gene expression/function in the brainstem is more likely to promote rapid accumulation of tau aggregates, manifesting as the malignant RS phenotype of PSP. In contrast, more subtle decreases in gene expression/function in the substantia nigra may lead to a lower tau burden, favouring the slower progressing PSP-P and PAGF phenotypes. In summary, the results of this study suggest that common variation at the TRIM11 locus may be a genetic modifier of clinical phenotype in PSP. Our findings add further evidence for the UPS playing a key role in tau pathology and therefore representing a potential target for disease modifying therapies. Further GWAS with larger cohorts to confirm our findings and identify other genetic signals, screening of whole genome/exome sequencing data for rare variants in TRIM11 and follow up functional studies at this locus are a priority."}]
