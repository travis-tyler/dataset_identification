Currently, our understanding of the pathological events and the molecular transition from the asymptomatic phase (AsymAD) (Driscoll et al., 2006) to clinically evident dementia is limited. Although amyloid-beta (Ab) deposi-tion in the brain is hypothesized to be a central force driving AD pathogenesis (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016) , individuals remain cognitively normal for many years despite accumulating aggregates of Ab plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles (Sperling et al., 2011) . Large-scale analysis of molecular alterations in human brain provides an unbiased, data-driven approach to identify the many complicated processes involved in AD pathogenesis and to prioritize their links to relevant clinical and neuropathological traits, including changes in the asymptomatic phase of disease.\nSystems-level analyses of large datasets have emerged as essential tools for identifying key molecular pathways and potential new drug targets. Algorithms such as weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) classify the transcriptome into biologically meaningful modules of co-expressed genes linked to specific cell types, organelles, and biological pathways (Miller et al., 2008; . Co-expression modules also link to disease processes in which the most centrally connected genes are highly enriched for key drivers that play prominent roles in disease pathogenesis (Cerami et al., 2010; Huan et al., 2013; Tran et al., 2011) . However, there are marked spatial, temporal, and quantitative differences between mRNA and protein expression (de Sousa Abreu et al., 2009) . In human tissues, only approximately one-third of mRNA-protein pairs show significant correlation in expression levels, with marked variation depending on their functions (Zhang et al., 2014a) . This relationship is not well understood in complex tissues such as brain; mRNA-protein correlation coefficients reach no higher than 0.47 even in acutely isolated brain cell types (Sharma et al., 2015) . While transcriptome networks in AD brain have been examined (Miller et al., 2008 (Miller et al., , 2013 Zhang et al., 2013) , network changes in the AD brain proteome, including those associated with the early asymptomatic stages of disease, have not been explored.\nIn this study, we coupled label-free mass-spectrometrybased proteomics and systems biology to define networks of highly correlated proteins associated with neuropathology and cognitive decline in the brains of healthy controls, AsymAD, and AD. Similar to RNA-based networks, the brain proteome is organized in biologically meaningful networks related to distinct functions and cell types (i.e., neurons, oligodendrocyte, astrocyte, and microglia). Downregulation of modules associated with neurons and synapses and upregulation of astroglial modules were strongly associated with amyloid plaque and neurofibrillary tangle pathologies, consistent with RNA-based networks previously reported for late-stage AD. However, comparison of RNA and protein networks shows that more than half of the protein co-expression modules are not well represented at the RNA level. These include modules associated with microtubule function, RNA/DNA binding, post-translational modification, and inflammation that were also strongly associated with AD phenotypes. Moreover, several of these were linked to AsymAD, progressively changing with cognitive status, and disease specific (i.e., not altered in other neurodegenerative diseases). Finally, common AD risk loci, identified by the IGAP consortium genome-wide association study (GWAS), were concentrated in glial-related modules in both the proteome and transcriptome consistent with their causal role in AD. Our findings highlight the use of large-scale proteomics and integrated systems biology to unravel the molecular etiology promoting initiation and progression of AD."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Proteomic Analysis of Human Brain Tissues", "text": "We collected post-mortem brain tissue from 50 individuals representing 15 controls, 15 AsymAD cases, and 20 AD cases from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) (O'Brien et al., 2009) . For 47 cases, we analyzed tissue from both the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (FC; Brodmann area 9) and precuneus (PC; Brodmann area 7). Both regions are affected in AD, and PC is a site of early amyloid deposition and glucose hypometabolism (Rabinovici et al., 2010) . All case metadata, including neuropathological criteria for amyloid (CERAD) and tau pathology (Braak) , are provided in Table S1 .\nSamples were uniformly homogenized and analyzed by SDS-PAGE prior to proteolytic digestion with trypsin for subsequent proteomic analysis ( Figure S1A ). To account for technical variation, each peptide digest was spiked with an isotopically labeled internal reference standard before analysis by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) on an Orbitrap Q-Exactive mass spectrometer (Figures S1B and S1C). Protein abundance was determined by peptide ion-intensity measurements across LC-MS runs using the label-free quantification (LFQ) algorithm in MaxQuant (Cox et al., 2014) (Figure S1D) . In total, 64,938 peptides mapping to 5,130 protein groups were identified. One limitation of ''shotgun'' label-free quantitative proteomics is missing data (i.e., missing protein identifications or abundance values), especially for low-abundance proteins (Karpievitch et al., 2012) . Thus, only those proteins quantified in at least 90% of samples for each brain region were included in the analysis, resulting in the final quantification of 2,735 protein groups mapping to 2,678 unique gene symbols across the 97 samples (n = 47 FC and n = 50 PC) (Table S2) . To quantify Ab levels in the brain samples, the ion intensities for two amyloid precursor protein (APP) peptides, corresponding to residues 6-16 and residues 17-28 of the Ab sequence, were summed for each individual case ( Figure S2 ). It is important to note that although these two peptides are derived from APP, they do not discriminate between the fulllength APP and cleaved Ab fragments. However, APP peptides mapping outside of the Ab sequence did not show a significant increase with pathology or clinical symptoms, whereas the two peptides mapping to Ab regions strongly correlate with CERAD and disease status across brain regions ( Figures 1A-1C and S2). Thus, these two APP peptides serve as measures of Ab levels in brain. Based on these findings, the LFQ intensities for these two Ab peptides were calculated in each individual sample and manually included as a separate protein measurement (assigned symbol ABETA) for subsequent differential and co-expression analyses."}, {"section_title": "Classification of AD and AsymAD Cases by Proteomic Measures", "text": "A total of 362 unique proteins in both brain regions (FC and PC) showed significantly altered levels of expression (ANOVA followed by Tukey's comparison post hoc test, p < 0.01) across three comparisons: (1) controls versus AsymAD, (2) controls versus AD, and (3) AsymAD versus AD ( Figure 1D ). The number of significant proteins compared to controls was proportional to disease severity in a cross-sectional analysis of AsymAD (n = 63) and AD (n = 280), indicating that differences in the proteome correlate with neuropathological burden and cognitive dysfunction. The differential proteome was consistently more complex (i.e., greater n of significantly altered proteins) in the FC compared to the PC ( Figure S3 ).\nTo determine whether differentially expressed proteins could be used as classifiers of disease status, we performed a supervised cluster analysis using Cluster 3.0 across control, AsymAD, and AD cases ( Figure 1E ). We restricted the analysis to those proteins significantly altered in at least two of the aforementioned comparisons across both FC and PC (n = 123; Figure S3A ; Table S2 ). As expected, the resulting dendrogram segregated the majority of control (green) and AD (blue) cases. In addition, AsymAD (red) cases, with rare exceptions, clustered between the control and AD cases. Thus, these select differentially expressed proteins provide a molecular signature distinguishing control, AsymAD and AD brains.\nGene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of classifier proteins that are significantly decreased (n = 67) in AD indicated overrepresentation of ''protein folding capacity'' and ''microtubule cytoskeleton'' proteins, whereas those related to ''response to protein stimulus'' and ''response to biotic stimulus'' were overrepresented among proteins increased in AD (n = 55) ( Figure S3 ). Several proteins displayed progressive increases or decreases in abundance across control, AsymAD, and AD cases ( Figure 1F ; Table S2 ). These included progressive increases in chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG), aggrecan (ACAN), and CSPG binding protein pleitrophin (PTN) in AsymAD and AD. In contrast, proteins involved in synaptic function and synaptogenesis, including SYNPO1, VGF, and the kinases CAMKK2 and CAMK4, displayed a progressive decrease across AsymAD and AD. Several proteins were altered exclusively in the symptomatic phase of disease, including increases in clusterin (CLU) and peptidase D (PEPD) and decreases in proteins involved in GTPase signaling, including RHOB and G protein subunit alpha i protein (GNAI1). Some changes in the proteome were of maximum magnitude and significance in AsymAD cases, including decreases in the synaptic protein HOMER1 and guanine deamidase GDA and increases in lysosomal marker LAMP1 and G-rich RNA-binding protein GRSF1 ( Figure 1F ). Of note, these latter three proteins are in a brain-tissue-specific genetic interaction neighborhood (Greene et al., 2015) that is highly significantly (false discovery rate (FDR)-corrected p < 1 3 10 \u00c07 ) enriched for the lysosome KEGG pathway. Endosomal-lysosomal dysfunction is strongly implicated in AD (Hu et al., 2015) . Considering other proteins significantly changed in AsymAD, like TMPO and HNRNPF (Table S2 ), the genetic interaction network landscape had edges that were consistently supported by changes found in a microarray study that identified transcripts altered downstream of an age-associated overexpressed circulating and brain-resident microRNA, mIR34-a (Chang et al., 2007; Li et al., 2011) . Overall, these results highlight the potential utility of differentially expressed proteins for classifying AD and identifying diseaserelated pathways, including those altered in the preclinical stage of AD."}, {"section_title": "Protein Co-expression Network Analysis of AD Brain", "text": "Co-expression analysis of the brain transcriptome effectively organizes RNA into networks related to molecular pathways, organelles, and cell types impacted by AD (Miller et al., 2008; Miller et al., 2013) . The correlation between RNA and protein in any given brain cell type is generally weak (Sharma et al., 2015) , and it is unclear whether similar networks manifest at the protein level in AD brain. Thus, we applied WGCNA to define trends in protein co-expression across FC and PC in BLSA brains (n = 97 samples). We corrected for age, sex, and postmortem interval (PMI)-mediated covariance of protein measurements and then normalized baseline protein expression differences between regions, setting a small minimum WGCNA module size of 17 proteins with a low propensity to merge modules (merge height of 0.07). These parameters identified 16 modules of strongly co-expressed groups of proteins and ranked by size, ranging from BLSA M1, BM-1 (largest, 396 proteins) to BM-16 (smallest, 28 proteins). Reducing the minimal module size in WGCNA for proteomic datasets facilitates module identification, although final modules were somewhat larger owing to final module member reassignment by eigenprotein correlation p value (reassignThresh parameter was set to p = 0.05 instead of the default p = 10 6 ). It should also be noted that a label-free protein expression matrix differs from a microarray or even RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) expression matrix because of the missing quantitative data for some proteins in a sample due to the stochastic nature of LC-MS/ MS. Therefore, choices for the threshold of missing data allowed into the matrix, and also for imputation of those values, if any, become important considerations for protein co-expression analysis. Networks were also analyzed for prefrontal and precuneus cortical regions, and because they showed significant overlap (data not shown), the expression data were combined as described above to maximize power.\nMany of these modules were significantly enriched for brainspecific gene ontologies as well as established cellular functions and/or organelles ( Figure 2A ; Table S3 ). The three largest modules were associated with categories of ''synaptic transmission'' (B-M1), ''myelin sheath'' (B-M2), and ''mitochondrion'' (B-M3), whereas B-M5 represented ''extracellular matrix'' and B-M6 ''inflammatory response.'' Other modules included those with GO terms linked to synaptic membrane and dendrites Transcript-based network analyses have shown that modules represent major sources of biological variance across the cortex and that some modules are enriched in genes expressed by different cell types . To determine if a similar relationship exists with protein-based networks, we evaluated the overlap of proteins in each module with brain cell-type-specific proteomes ( Figure 2B ; Table S4 ) generated previously from acutely isolated neurons, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and microglia from mouse brain (Sharma et al., 2015) . The largest module, B-M1, was enriched with neuron-specific proteins, including neuritic (CAMK2A and CAMKK2) and synaptic (SYNGAP1, RTN1, and L1CAM) proteins. The B-M4 module was also enriched for neuronal protein markers, including GBRA1, GBRA2, OLFM1, and NRXN3, associated with ''synaptic membrane and dendrites.'' Oligodendrocyte-specific proteins were overrepresented as hub proteins in B-M2 related to myelination, including CNP, MAG, MOG, PLP1, and MBP gene products. Astrocyte proteins were predominantly enriched in B-M6 (e.g., GFAP, PBXIP1, and GJA1) and B-M9 (e.g., SLCA11, ALDOC, and GCSH). Finally, microglial protein markers were over-represented in the B-M5 module (e.g., ANXA1, ANXA4, CTSZ, and CLIC), B-M6 (e.g., MSN, LCP1, LSP1, and C1QC) and, to a lesser extent, B-M2 (e.g., CRYL1, NPC2, and CNDP2). Thus, as seen in transcriptome-level network analyses (Miller et al., 2008; Oldham et al., 2008) , certain modules of co-expressed proteins enrich with markers of specific brain cell types and likely reflect changes in the abundance, activation, and/or changing phenotype(s) of these cells in AD."}, {"section_title": "Correlation of Protein Networks with AD Neuropathology and Cognitive Status", "text": "We assessed the module correlations to the hallmark neuropathological traits of amyloid plaques (CERAD) and neurofibrillary tangles (Braak) across control, AsymAD, and AD cases to identify protein networks associated with both neuropathological features and clinical symptoms ( Figure 3A ). Five BLSA modules had positive correlation with CERAD and/or Braak and included those associated with ''inflammatory response'' (B-M6), ''ribonucleoprotein function'' (B-M8), and ''apoptosis'' (B-M13). The eigenproteins for these modules also increased between control and AsymAD and between AsymAD and AD ( Figure 3B ), indicating that protein expression changes begin early in the asymptomatic phase of disease. In WGCNA, a module eigengene, or in our case, an eigenprotein, is defined as the first principal component of a given module and serves as a representative, weighted expression profile for the module. Module B-M15 with ontologies associated with ''microtubule regulation'' showed significant correlation exclusively with CERAD, whereas B-M5 harbored extracellular matrix proteins enriched in astrocyte/microglial markers and showed correlation exclusively with Braak stages ( Figures 3A and 3B) .\nSeveral module expression profiles were significantly decreased in AD and negatively correlated with AD neuropathology ( Figures 3A and 3C) . Namely, B-M1 and B-M4, both enriched with neuronal markers ( Figure 2B ) and associated with related ontologies, were negatively correlated with CERAD and Braak scores, consistent with loss of synaptic proteins in AD (Terry et al., 1991) and observed in RNA co-expression modules (Miller et al., 2008) . Module B-M3, enriched with mitochondrial proteins, was also decreased across AD cases, consistent with a loss of mitochondrial function and hypometabolic phenotype observed in patients with AD (Alexander et al., 2002) .\nTwo modules enriched with tubulin binding proteins, B-M12 and B-M14, were negatively correlated with CERAD score and Braak stage, consistent with a known loss of microtubule function with tau aggregation in AD (Feinstein and Wilson, 2005) . Notably, B-M14, the module with the strongest negative correla-tion to Braak (cor = \u00c00.57, p = 8e-9) and CERAD (cor = \u00c00.47, p = 3e-6), was enriched with proteins associated with ''hydrolase activity,'' represented by the hub protein PPP1R7, a subunit of protein phosphatase 1, and deubiquitinase OTUB1, as well as several microtubule proteins (DNM3, RTN4, EPB41L3, and TUBB3) involved in neurite formation and/or transport. All three isoforms of tau (MAPT) correlated negatively with these phosphatase-enriched modules (Table S2) , consistent with the role of tau hyperphosphorylation in neurofibrillary tangle pathology.\nSince little is known about the preclinical molecular changes of AD, one goal of this study was to examine AsymAD cases to identify protein networks affected early in AD progression. Decreased expression of the B-M1 and B-M4 modules in AsymAD indicates loss of synaptic proteins prior to the onset of cognitive impairment. B-M8 was particularly elevated among AsymAD and AD samples, implicating perturbations in RNA metabolism. We and others have previously identified RNA splicing deficits in AD brain that could have profound impact "}, {"section_title": "Figure 2. Protein Co-expression Classifies the Proteome into Modules Associated with Specific Gene Ontologies and Brain Cell Types", "text": "(A) WGCNA cluster dendrogram groups proteins (n = 2,735) measured across FC and PC into distinct protein modules (M1-16) defined by dendrogram branch cutting. These modules were significantly enriched for gene ontologies linked to discrete cellular functions and/or organelles in the brain.\n(B) Cell-type enrichment was assessed by cross-referencing module proteins (via matching gene symbols) using the one-tailed Fisher's exact test against lists of proteins determined as enriched in neurons, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and microglia (Table S4 ). The FDR was corrected for multiple comparisons by the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) method; bars extending above the line represent BH p < 0.01. on transcription of many genes, including tau, APP, and presenilins (Bai et al., 2013; Tollervey et al., 2011) . The correlation of module B-M8 with both AsymAD and AD suggests that changes in RNA metabolism occur in the preclinical stages of disease. B-M6, linked to ''inflammatory response,'' is also increased in AsymAD, which may reflect phenotypic activation and/or proliferation of astrocytes and microglia prior to cognitive decline. Of note, B-M13 was suppressed and more tightly correlated across AsymAD samples compared to control samples ( Figure 3B) . Given that this module increases in AD compared to AsymAD, proteins within this module may reflect a transient, concerted downregulation of a protein network prior to upregulation with symptom onset, potentially implicating B-M13 as important for cognitive decline. Key hub proteins in B-M13 included MAPK1 and MAPK3, stress-activated kinases previously observed as increased in AD transcriptome studies of hippocampus (Miller et al., 2013) . Module B-M5, enriched with microglia and astrocyte markers, increased only in the symptomatic phase of AD, suggesting that neuroinflammation proteins in this module may be important mediators of cognitive decline or disease progression. Thus, co-expression analysis effectively organizes the brain proteome into protein modules that are strongly linked to neuropathological features of AD and presence or absence of clinical symptoms."}, {"section_title": "A B C", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Validation of Protein Expression Changes in an Independent Cohort of Brain Tissues", "text": "To assess the reproducibility of our findings in the BLSA cases, and the specificity of the changes for AD versus other neurodegenerative diseases, we performed a second proteomic analysis of brain homogenates prepared from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of clinically and pathologically characterized control, AD, Parkinson's Disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) cases (n = 8 per group; Table S5 ) collected from the Emory Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. In total, 53,313 peptides mapping to 4,356 proteins groups were identified. As with the BLSA cases, only those proteins quantified in at least 90% of cases were included in the analysis, resulting in the final use of 2,491 quantified protein groups mapping to 2,433 unique gene symbols. A total of 48 differentially expressed proteins in the Emory AD cases overlapped with significant protein changes in the BLSA AD cases ( Figure S4 ). Of these, 47 were consistent in their direction of change in the BLSA and Emory AD cases. As seen in the BLSA cases, Ab (ABETA) represented the most increased protein in the Emory AD cases, followed by the small heat shock protein HSP27 (HSPB1), which is significantly and selectively elevated only in AD compared to control, PD, and ALS ( Figure S4) . Thus, the combination of Emory and BLSA proteomic datasets confirmed the reproducibility of differentially expressed proteins and allowed us to identify those changes that occur during the asymptomatic phase as well as those that are AD specific or shared among neurodegenerative diseases. We next compared the protein co-expression networks between the BLSA and Emory cases. A total of 23 modules (E-M1 to E-M23) were generated from the Emory brain proteome using WGCNA (see STAR Methods). The increased number of modules in the Emory network (Table S6 ) compared to the BLSA network can be attributed to the additional diversity of neurodegenerative disease cases (AD, PD, and ALS). Impor-tantly, 13 of the 16 modules in the BLSA network ( Figure 4A) were preserved in the Emory network, with Z summary scores above 2 (p < 0.05) ( Figure 4A ) (Langfelder et al., 2011) . Module overlap across networks was also assessed using a hypergeometic Fisher's exact test (Figure 5A, left) . Modules showed significant positive correlation (red), anti-correlation (blue), or no correlation (white) in protein membership (via matched gene symbols). The vast majority of BLSA modules (14/16) showed at least one cognate module within Emory proteome, and conversely, 17 out of 23 modules in the Emory brain network overlapped in the BLSA proteome. Thus, protein co-expression networks are conserved across both BLSA and Emory brains, supporting the robustness of WGCNA in defining consistent patterns of protein co-expression representing shared biology (Parikshak et al., 2015) ."}, {"section_title": "AD-Specific Network Changes Compared to Other Neurodegenerative Diseases", "text": "The Emory proteome allowed us to identify networks that were specific to AD as well as those shared across AD, PD, and ALS, the latter potentially representing common mechanisms of neurodegeneration. For example, four Emory modules (E-M3, E-M4, E-M11, and E-M21) were each significantly increased in AD compared to PD, ALS, and control cases (Figures 4B and S5) . Three of these modules (E-M3, E-M4, and E-M21) showed strong overlap with BLSA modules B-M5 and B-M6. Notably, E-M21 included humoral immune response proteins C4 and LTA4H, whereas E-M11 showed a high degree of overlap with BLSA module B-M13 that associated with apoptosis ( Figure 5A) . In contrast, E-M9 and E-M19, two modules in the Emory network (overlapping with B-M13, and B-M5 plus B-M6, respectively, in the BLSA network) ( Figures 4B and  5A) , were increased across AD, PD, and ALS cases. E-M9 was represented by GO terms, including ''defense response,'' whereas E-M19 was represented by ''extracellular region'' and ''immune response,'' indicating that common mechanisms in neurodegeneration also involve these ontologies. Other Emory proteome modules, especially E-M3, E-M4, and E-M11 (overlapping with B-M5, B-M6 and B-M13 respectively in the BLSA), were specifically altered in AD ( Figure 4B) . Representative module gene ontologies for the Emory network are in Table S7 .\nDecreases in expression in neuronal and synaptic protein enriched modules E-M7 and E-M15, overlapping with B-M1 in the BLSA proteome, were selectively observed in AD ( Figure 4C) . Two modules enriched with microtubule and cytoskeletal proteins (E-M10 and E-M20), with shared biology common to B-M14 in the BLSA proteomic network, were also selectively decreased in AD. In contrast, E-M12 and E-M18, related to ontologies associated with ''centrosome'' and ''cytoskeleton,'' were decreased across all neurodegenerative disease groups. Thus, loss of certain cytoskeletal proteins appears to be a common mechanism in AD, PD, and ALS, whereas AD-specific modules are linked to a loss of a select group of microtubule and related proteins represented respectively by hubs MAP1B (E-M10) and DNM3 (E-M20) (Gray et al., 2003; Kawakami et al., 2003) . Overall, the direction of change of overlapping modules in the Emory AD cases compared to non-AD neurodegenerative diseases is highly consistent with the network analysis from the BLSA cohort."}, {"section_title": "Overlap between RNA and Protein Co-expression Networks in AD Reveals Both Shared and Protein-Specific Network Changes", "text": "Well-established differences between expression of mRNA and their respective translated proteins prompted us to investigate the degree of conservation in RNA-versus protein-based coexpression networks. We first generated an RNA co-expression network from previously reported microarray measurements of 18,204 genes across AD (n = 308) and control (n = 157) cases from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex . A total of 20 distinct transcriptome modules were identified (Figure 5A, right;  Table S8 ) that closely correspond to the originally reported network . The relationship of these modules to AD versus control status is shown in Figure 5B , with a full list of module gene ontologies provided in Table S9 . As expected, we identified a series of RNA modules that were enriched for specific cell-type markers (Zhang et al., 2014b) , including neuronal (T-M1, T-M9, and TM-16), oligodendrocyte (T-M13, T-M17, and T-M19), astrocyte (T-M10 and T-M7), microglia (T-M3 and T-M18), and endothelial cells (T-M3, T-M18, TM-10, and T-M15). Moreover, consistent with our findings in the protein co-expression networks, transcriptome-based modules enriched with microglia and astrocytes genes were among the most significantly increased in AD, whereas modules enriched with neuronal genes were among the most decreased ( Figures  5B and 5C ). Protein and transcriptome modules with the highest degree of overlap were those associated with shared cell-type markers; these proteins showed strong correlation (cor = 0.53) with their cognate RNA compared to all overlapping proteins mapped in the transcriptome (cor = 0.25) ( Figures 5C and 5D) . Despite the presence of shared cell-type-specific modules in the protein and RNA networks, only 39% (9/23) of the Emory protein modules overlapped with RNA modules. This stands in contrast to the 74% (17/23) module overlap observed across the Emory and BLSA brain protein networks ( Figure 5A) .\nA key finding of this study is that several Emory protein modules that significantly increased (E-M9, E-M11, and E-M19) or decreased (E-M6, E-M10, E-M12, E-M18, and E-M20) in AD did not overlap with transcriptome modules, consistent with a weak overall RNA-protein correlation (cor = 0.22) for these genes and cognate proteins ( Figure 5D, right) . For example, E-M10 and E-M20 (and the highly related B-M14 module in the BLSA Signed -log10 FDR corrected p-value BLSA Protein Modules T-M7 13.9 T-M12 1.94 T-M13 13.2 T-M17 \u22120.79 T-M19 1.17 T-M2 0.99 T-M6 0.45 T-M20 9.99 T-M11 4.78 T-M8 13.9 T-M15 5.34 T-M3 26.6 T-M18 16.3 T-M14 27.6 T-M10 25.2 Signed -log10 FDR corrected p-value exact test was used to determine which modules shared significant overlap or depletion of module members between the Emory and BLSA proteome networks (left) and Emory proteome and RNA networks (right). The 23 modules in the Emory case network (x axis), clustered by module eigenprotein relatedness, were aligned to the 16 modules in the BLSA network (y axis). Module gene symbol lists showed significant overlap (red), depletion (blue), or no significant under-or over-representation (white) in protein membership. Numbers are positive signed \u00c0log 10 (FDR-corrected overrepresentation p values) representing degree of significance of overlap; asterisks also represent degree of significance for either positive or depleted comparisons (*p < 0.05; **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.005). (B) The degree of significance related to AD with correlation sign [signed -log 10 (FDR corrected p value)] is provided for each transcriptome module. Module eigengenes were correlated to AD status and multiple comparisons were accounted for by FDR correction (Benjamini-Hochberg) across modules with significance.\n(legend continued on next page) proteome) do not have a cognate transcriptome module. Thus, despite manifold deeper coverage, the transcriptome does not capture all key changes occurring in the AD brain, including reduced levels of protein phosphatases and microtubulebinding proteins that are enriched in these modules.\nAnother protein-based module that shows weak overlap in the RNA networks in brain is E-M19, which harbors several acute phase reactants (e.g., A2M and CP) and immunoglobulins (IGHG1 and IGHA1), as well as blood fibrinogens involved in coagulation (Mosesson, 2005) . As most of these genes are not generally well expressed in brain (Zhang et al., 2014b) , protein members of this module could potentially be blood derived and deposited in brain following disruption of the blood-brain barrier, which is exacerbated with aging and neurodegenerative disease (Ryu and McLarnon, 2009; Zlokovic, 2008) . For example, insoluble fibrinogen or fibrin can be deposited in brain and drive adaptive immune responses as well as microglial inflammation (Ryu et al., 2015) . Other notable protein modules that did not overlap in the transcriptome included E-M6, which was decreased across all neurodegenerative disease ( Figure S5 ) and enriched with DNA/RNA-associated proteins including splicing factors. Discordant RNA-protein correlation between splicing factors have previously been reported (Zhang et al., 2014a) . Thus, our findings reveal shared modules between the transcriptome and proteome networks that mainly associate with cell type, as well as an AD associated group of divergent or ''protein-only'' networks associated with microtubule binding, inflammation, and DNA/RNA-binding functions."}, {"section_title": "AD GWAS Candidates Are Enriched in Convergent", "text": "Protein and RNA Networks Preferentially Associated with Microglia and Oligodendrocytes Integration of genetic risks and gene expression networks has proven fruitful for identifying potential causal mechanisms (Voineagu et al., 2011) . We used a similar approach to assess for enrichment of the proteins encoded by AD risk loci in the BLSA and Emory protein networks. Summary data from GWAS of AD, schizophrenia, and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) were used as input for MAGMA, which controls for confounders such as gene length (de Leeuw et al., 2015) , to generate a single p value for each protein coding risk loci (Table S10 ). In the BLSA network, translated protein products from AD candidate genes defined with a MAGMA p value of < 0.05 (\u00c0log p value > 1.3) were over-represented in the oligodendrocyte (B-M2) and astrocyte and microglia (B-M5) extracellular matrix protein modules. A total of 24 candidate genes mapped to B-M2, including BIN1 and PICALM, whereas 11 candidate genes mapped to the B-M5 module, including APOE, CLU, and FERMT2 ( Figures 6A and  2B) . Enrichment of candidate genes in B-M5 was not solely driven by the presence of APOE, as B-M5 was still significant after omitting APOE from the analysis (data not shown). In contrast, candidate genes for ASD and schizophrenia with MAGMA p values of < 0.05 were significantly over-represented in the B-M1 and B-M4 neuron and synaptic modules, which is consistent with a previous finding of enrichment of ASD risk genes in neuronal modules (Voineagu et al., 2011) . Similar results were also observed for the Emory network ( Figure S6) . These findings in the proteome were corroborated at the mRNA level, (C) RNA modules were found enriched for specific cell type markers (Table S4) including neuronal, oligodendrocyte, astrocyte, microglia and endothelial cells following one-way Fisher's exact test overlap with cell-type specific transcriptomes. The FDR was corrected for multiple comparisons by the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) method; bars extending above the line represent BH p < 0.05. (D) Pearson correlation analysis between all overlapping protein-RNA targets (n = 2,406, left panel). Pearson correlation analysis between Protein-RNA targets in Emory modules that overlap with the transcriptome and change in the AD proteome (n = 411, middle panel). This included protein modules increased in AD (E-M4, E-M21 and E-M3) that are enriched in astrocyte/microglia/endothelial markers and modules decreased in AD (E-M15 and E-M7) that are enriched with neuronal markers. Pearson correlation analysis between Protein-RNA targets in Emory modules that did not overlap with modules in the transcriptome (n = 411, right panel), yet were increased (E-M19, E-M11 and E-M9) or decreased (E-M20, E-M10, E-M6, E-M18 and E-M12) in AD. Genes and cognate proteins were grouped and colored by their Emory protein module membership. as AD candidate risk loci were enriched in T-M3, associated with microglial and endothelial cell markers ( Figures 6B and 5C) . A total of 33 GWAS candidates, including HMHA1, MS4A6A, CD2AP, MS4A4A, HLA-DRA, and FERMT2, were enriched in T-M3. As seen in the protein networks, T-M13, which is associated with oligodendrocyte genes, was also enriched with 27 AD GWAS candidates, including BIN1, whereas ASD and schizophrenia GWAS candidates were mainly over-represented in neuronal modules (T-M1 and T-M9) as well as module T-M13 in ASD. Thus, we conclude that genetic risk loci for late-onset AD overlap in convergent RNA and protein networks preferentially enriched in microglia and oligodendrocytes, further providing network-driven evidence implicating glial dysfunction in the etiology of late-onset AD."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "Our proteomic studies offer new insights into changes in individual proteins and protein networks linked to AD, including changes related to poorly understood preclinical stages of AD. Protein co-expression modules linked to astrocytic, microglial, and neuronal functions in the BLSA cases revealed strong positive and negative correlations, respectively, with AD neuropathological burden and clinical symptoms. These BLSA networks were highly preserved in an independent cohort of Emory cases, which also revealed modules specific for AD, as well as networks of co-expressed proteins shared with other neurodegenerative diseases. We also observed relatively strong preservation of select modules derived from proteomics and previously reported transcriptomic studies of AD, especially those enriched in cell-type-specific markers (neurons, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and microglia). However, most modules altered in the AD proteome were not well represented in the transcriptome, including those associated with microtubule function, RNA and DNA binding, and inflammation. These discrepancies may be due to well-known differences in the regulation, localization, and functions of mRNA and proteins. For example, a poor correlation between expression levels of microtubule-associated mRNA and protein in AD may in part be due to a spatial mismatch between neuronal cell bodies that express the mRNA and the degenerating axons where the proteins accumulate. Another example is the deposition of plasma proteins and peripheral immune cells that are often deposited in brain following disruption of the blood-brain barrier (Zlokovic, 2008) . The observed differences between protein-and RNA-based modules highlights the value of incorporating both transcriptomic and proteomic data in efforts to advance our understanding of AD pathogenesis and identifying novel therapeutic targets.\nDespite the divergence in RNA and protein networks, one important similarity across the brain transcriptome and proteome was the consistent mapping of AD GWAS candidates to networks enriched in oligodendrocytes and microglia markers. This observation strongly implies that these modules reflect causal pathogenic processes involved in AD. Protein and RNA networks enriched in microglial proteins were significantly increased in AD and strongly correlated with both neurofibrillary tangle pathology and cognitive decline. These results echo recent large transcriptomic and AD GWAS network studies that show the involvement of microglial gene products and GWAS candidates in AD (Jones et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2013) . Thus, while significant synaptic and neuronal loss can occur prior to symptom onset in the asymptomatic phase of AD, our findings in the proteome suggest that clinical symptoms are associated with the increase in protein networks linked to inflammation, in particular those enriched with microglia.\nOne limitation of our study was the relative lack of proteome depth ($4,500 proteins per sample) compared to transcriptomics ($18,000). Each individual case proteome was generated from a ''single shot'' LC-MS/MS analysis (120-min gradient) without prior fractionation at the protein or peptide level. However, the trade-off of proteome depth was the increased number of individual samples analyzed (n = 129), which bolsters networkbased approaches requiring a high number of biological replicates to reach consensus . Of note, future studies incorporating multiplex isobaric peptide mass tagging approaches and fractionation will enable both deeper proteome coverage with fewer missing values across individual samples (McAlister et al., 2012) . Direct comparison of the transcriptome and proteome in the same cases will also be possible in the future with the Accelerating Medicine Partnership for AD projects using postmortem brains from several thousand cases to identify novel therapeutic targets and biomarkers (Hodes and Buckholtz, 2016) . Nevertheless, our studies reveal an impressive integrated view of protein co-expression that validate across two independent groups of brains, highlighting the robustness of our approach. Furthermore, our application of multi-network-driven approaches (RNA and protein) offer new insights into the pathways underlying preclinical changes in AD brain and provide further evidence that non-neuronal cells mediate the genetic risk of developing AD."}, {"section_title": "STAR+METHODS", "text": "Detailed methods are provided in the online version of this paper and include the following: "}, {"section_title": "AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Conceptualization", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "STAR+METHODS KEY RESOURCES TABLE", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "CONTACT FOR REAGENT AND RESOURCE SHARING", "text": "Further information and requests for reagents may be directed to, and will be fulfilled by the lead contact corresponding author, Dr. Nicholas T.

All homogenization was performed using a Bullet Blender (Next Advance) according to manufacturer protocols. Briefly, each tissue piece was added to Urea lysis buffer in a 1.5 mL Rino tube (Next Advance) harboring 750 mg stainless steel beads (0.9-2 mm in diameter) and blended twice for 5 min intervals in the cold room (4 C). Protein supernatants were transferred to 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes and sonicated (Sonic Dismembrator, Fisher Scientific) 3 times for 5 s with 15 s intervals of rest at 30% amplitude to disrupt nucleic acids and subsequently vortexed. Protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) method, and samples were frozen in aliquots at \u00c080 C. Each brain homogenate was analyzed by SDS-PAGE to assess protein integrity ( Figure S1 ). Protein homogenates (150 ug) were diluted with 50 mM NH 4 HCO 3 to a final concentration of less than 2M urea and then treated with 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) at 25 C for 30 min, followed by 5 mM iodoacetamide REAGENT "}, {"section_title": "GWAS Module Association", "text": "To determine if any protein products of GWAS targets were enriched in a particular module, we used the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) summary statistics from the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (http://web.pasteur-lille.fr/en/recherche/ u744/igap/igap_download.php) (Lambert et al., 2013) to calculate the gene level association value using MAGMA (de Leeuw et al., 2015) . Notably, MAGMA takes the mean of all the transformed SNP P values associated with a particular gene and uses a known approximation of the distribution to get the gene association value. MAGMA accounts for linkage disequilibrium (LD) using reference data with similar ancestry. Gene identifications in the Magma output file were converted to gene symbols using the biological Database Network (https://biodbnet-abcc.ncifcrf.gov/db/db2db.php). These gene lists were further filtered to select for genes that have a MAGMA defined gene association value > 1.3 (-log p value). APOE was added to the gene list and assigned a -log p value of 50, given its known strong association with AD (Coon et al., 2007) . For each module in the protein network, the mean GWAS significance value (-log P) was calculated as the enrichment score for the module. Random sampling (10,000 times) of the MAGMA gene list was used to assess the significance of the module enrichment score. The enrichment scores were then scaled by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of the random samplings. The P value was calculated as the proportion of samplings that have a scaled enrichment score greater than or equal to the module enrichment score.
