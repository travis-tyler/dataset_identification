[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Background: Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is commonly treated by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunting. However, the long-term efficacy of shunt intervention in the presence of comorbid Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology is debated. Objective: To identify AD-associated CSF biomarkers predictive of shunting surgery outcomes in patients with iNPH. Methods: Preoperative levels of total and phosphorylated Tau (p-Tau) were measured in 40 patients with iNPH divided into low (<30 pg/mL) and high (\u226530 pg/mL) p-Tau groups and followed up for three years after lumboperitoneal shunting. The modified Rankin Scale (mRS), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Frontal Assessment Battery, and iNPH Grading Scale scores were compared between the age-adjusted low (n = 24; mean age 75.7 years [SD 5.3]) and high (n = 11; mean age 76.0 years [SD 5.6]) p-Tau groups. Results: Cognitive function improved early in the low p-Tau group and was maintained thereafter (p = 0.005). In contrast, the high p-Tau group showed a gradual decline to baseline levels by the third postoperative year (p = 0.040). Although the p-Tau concentration did not correlate with the preoperative MMSE score, a negative correlation appeared and strengthened during follow-up (R 2 = 0.352, p < 0.001). Furthermore, the low p-Tau group showed rapid and sustained mRS grade improvement, whereas mRS performance gradually declined in the high p-Tau group. Conclusions: Preoperative CSF p-Tau concentration predicted some aspects of cognitive function after shunt intervention in patients with iNPH. The therapeutic effects of shunt treatment were shorter-lasting in patients with coexisting AD pathology."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is a neurodegenerative condition characterized by gait disturbance, dementia, and urinary incontinence [1] . Independence in everyday life and improvements in cognitive functions in patients with iNPH can be achieved through shunt treatment. In Japan, an iNPH guideline was published ahead of the Western world in 2004 [2] , and revised in 2011 [3] . This guideline noted that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunt intervention in patients with possible iNPH on MRI resulted in an improvement in the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score in >80% of the patients within a year [4] . Additional improvements were also observed in the following symptoms: gait disturbance with a wide short-stepped gait; cognitive impairment resulting in decreased psychomotor speed; urinary urgency; overactive bladder manifesting mainly as urinary incontinence; ventricular enlargement; narrowing of the high convexity in the subarachnoid space; and disproportionately enlarged subarachnoid-space hydrocephalus (DESH) with CSF retention in the subarachnoid space under the sylvian fissure [5] . These positive results support the use of the diagnosis techniques recommended in the iNPH guideline. CSF shunting is currently approved as the only treatment method for iNPH with evidence of efficacy [6] ; however, the long-term effects of shunt intervention are still in question [7, 8] . Additionally, the treatment outcome can be affected by the presence of various complications in the elderly [9] .\nCSF diagnosis by the multiplex xMAP Luminex platform (Luminex Corp, Austin, TX) has been used in Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) studies to differentiate patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from healthy controls [10, 11] . Based on these studies, we used CSF biomarkers to verify the presence of AD comorbidity in patients with iNPH [12] .\nThe diagnosis of AD comorbidity based on radiographic findings alone is often difficult [13] . Patel and colleagues [14] showed that the levels of amyloid-\u2424 peptide (A\u2424 42 ) and tau protein phosphorylated at threonine 181 (p-Tau) were the most significant CSF biomarkers for predicting the presence of cortical tissue AD pathology; in particular, high p-Tau/A\u2424 42 ratios in the ventricular CSF were correlated with cortical AD pathology. The A\u2424 42 levels in the lumbar CSF (L-CSF) of iNPH patients are lower than those in healthy seniors [25] ; however, they are often even lower among patients with AD [15] . The total Tau and p-Tau protein levels in patients with iNPH are reported to be similar to or lower than those in healthy individuals [16] , and, unlike A\u2424 42 , clearly lower than those in patients with AD [15] . Shunt intervention in iNPH patients with high total Tau or p-Tau levels shows poor improvement [17, 18] , which is considered an indicator of neuronal disorder or AD comorbidity. Previous reports have shown that although the CSF biomarkers of iNPH patients can be affected by concomitant Tau or amyloid pathology, the CSF p-Tau concentration is highly useful for the differentiation of iNPH and AD [19, 20] .\nIn the ADNI cohort, p-Tau is an advancedstage marker related to dementia symptoms and disease progression [21] . The threshold value for discrimination between AD patients and age-matched cognitively normal elderly subjects is 23-25 pg/mL (sensitivity, 68-87%; specificity 68-73%) [10, 22] . In the present study, as a specific marker for AD, subjects were grouped by the p-Tau concentration alone to evaluate AD pathology [23, 24] . At present, there is no p-Tau cutoff value that determines whether AD pathology is coexistent in the L-CSF of iNPH patients. A previous study using the xMAP showed that the p-Tau levels in an iNPH group were lower than or similar to those in a control group [16] . We used the p-Tau cutoff value of 30 pg/mL obtained from the results of the Japanese ADNI [10] to follow iNPH patients long-term.\nIncreased p-Tau concentrations in the CSF reflect AD pathology [24] . CSF shunting in iNPH patients with coexisting AD is believed to have smaller and shorter-lasting therapeutic effects than in patients without comorbidity. Thus, the efficacy of shunt intervention in patients with iNPH is debated [25] . We aimed to examine whether the cognitive improvements due to shunt treatment were sustained for three years in patients diagnosed with iNPH based on symptom examination and imaging findings, particularly in iNPH patients with AD."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study populations", "text": "The present cohort included 40 patients with iNPH, 29 males and 11 females, with a mean age of 74.3 years (SD 6.6). These patients received lumboperitoneal (LP) shunt intervention from February 2010 to February 2015 at the Juntendo University Department of Neurosurgery. The diagnostic criteria were symptoms of iNPH in accordance with the iNPH Guidelines [3] and ventriculomegaly with an Evans Index of >0.3. The patients were followed up for three years. A retrospective analysis of the detailed course of clinical symptoms, including longterm progress, was then performed. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) [26, 27] , Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB) [28] , mRS, and Japan iNPH Grading Scale (iNPHGS; assessing gait disturbance, cognitive impairment, and urinary incontinence) [29] were used for evaluation.\nBiomarkers were measured in CSF sampled by lumbar tap before shunt intervention. The patients were assessed for coexisting AD using a p-Tau cutoff of 30 pg/mL and divided into high p-Tau (\u226530 pg/mL, n = 12) and low p-Tau (<30 pg/mL, n = 28) groups. Differences in long-term prognosis were compared between groups. The p-Tau cutoff value of \u226530 pg/mL was determined based on L-CSF data obtained from cognitively normal subjects with negative 11 C-Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) scans (n = 22) and patients with AD with positive PiB PET scans (n = 17) [11] . An age-adjusted control study was conducted with 11 high p-Tau and 24 low p-Tau patients (Table 1) . Four cases of patients aged 65 or under were excluded from the low p-Tau group, and one case where third-year examination data could not be taken was removed from the high p-Tau group. Comparison between groups showed no significant difference in age after removing these five cases (Fig. 1) .\nThis study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Juntendo University and Niigata University.

According to the Laupacis standards [34] , for the treatment to be cost-effective, a treated group needs to maintain the mRS score for 18 months after ventriculoperitoneal shunt, and 21 months after LP shunt surgery, with grade 1 evidence [35] . For this requirement to be realized, the treatment effect of shunt intervention for patients with iNPH should be maintained for at least two years. According to Kazui and colleagues, attenuation of cognitive impairment is a major factor contributing to the caregiver analysis through Zarit burden interviews [36, 37] . The diagnosis of iNPH remains challenging, especially at early stages, when presenting symptoms that largely overlap with those of other neurodegenerative diseases [38] . In particular, cognitive function is affected most strongly by AD comorbidity, leading to a poor response to shunting intervention [25, 39] . Therefore, we consider the identification of AD comorbidity to be crucial for successful shunt intervention in iNPH.\nWhile a diagnosis of iNPH is typically based on symptom evaluation and radiographic findings [3] , identifying patients who are more likely to respond to specific treatments by adding a CSF biomarker adjunctive diagnostic test can increase the effectiveness of our limited medical resources [17, 18, 40, 41] . To develop such a test in the present study, we categorized patients with iNPH based on biochemical analyses of CSF collected before shunt intervention, and then retrospectively tracked cognitive function, gait disturbance, urinary incontinence, and mRS performance for three years after the surgery. Group analyses showed that the duration of shunt-induced improvements in these functions was shorter in the high p-Tau group compared with the low p-Tau group. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a correlation between preoperative p-Tau CSF levels (determined using the xMAP Luminex platform) and three-year prognosis after shunt intervention in patients with iNPH. We used MMSE, FAB, mRS, and iNPHGS scores as cognitive outcome measures. Notably, the results of cognitive function evaluation with the MMSE and FAB differed from those obtained with the iNPHGS. This difference is likely attributable to the iNPHGS including multiple subjective elements.\nOur results showed that the current practice of using radiographic findings and symptom assessment only for diagnosis is not sufficient to predict the long-term success of shunt treatment for iNPH. In addition to conventional diagnosis, preoperative CSF parameters, measured by the xMAP Luminex platform, were useful for a more accurate long-term prognosis. There may be temporary relief following a restoration of CSF flow, but the presence of underlying neurodegenerative changes more directly correlates with long-term outcomes. There may also be a direct correlation between altered CSF dynamics and both metabolic clearance and the development of dementia [42] . A significant correlation between total Tau and pTau levels was observed; however, including total Tau in our data did not improve analysis accuracy. In addition, there was no correlation between A\u2424 42 concentration and cognition after surgery. In this study, the participants were grouped by p-Tau concentration alone to evaluate the effects of comorbid AD pathology [34] . However, it may be premature to conclude that the observed negative correlation between cognitive outcomes and p-Tau levels reflects the advancement of AD because cerebral tissue pathology [43, 44] and Tau PET findings [45, 46] were not considered. CSF shunting may have been partially effective in the high p-Tau group because favorable outcomes, albeit non-significant when compared with preoperative values, were achieved in the short term. The non-significant mRS and iNPHGS improvements may be attributed to the small number of cases in the high p-Tau group. In the short-term follow-up, absolute improvements appeared to be Differences in mRS score before and after surgery were evaluated using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Differences between low and high p-Tau groups were assessed using the Mann-Whitney U test. The worse/improved patient ratios were evaluated using Pearson's chi-squared test. * p < 0.05.

As discussed above, shunt intervention requires nearly two years of sustained improvement to be cost-effective. This condition was sufficiently satisfied in the low p-Tau group; however, a clear judgment cannot be made on the economic prudence of this treatment in patients with high p-Tau levels. This report has several limitations. Selection bias may have affected the results of this single-center retrospective study. In addition, arguments have been put forth against using CSF biomarkers as evidence of AD comorbidity in patients with iNPH. Various factors, such as CSF retention and diffusion impairment, affect the levels of CSF biomarkers obtained from lumbar puncture, and may reflect disturbances in the transition or clearance of A\u2424 and Tau proteins from the interstitial cell fluid to the L-CSF [47] . Parkinson's-related neurodegenerative diseases, which are similar to AD and thought to have high rates of complications, cannot be identified by p-Tau, total Tau, or A\u2424 42 CSF levels. In cases of iNPH where AD coexists, comorbidities in Parkinson's-related neurodegenerative diseases have a strong impact on the long-term prognosis of iNPH [48] . Therefore, incorporating the results of adjunctive diagnostic tests, such as the DaT scan (dopamine transporter visualization using single-photon emission computed tomography brain imaging), into the diagnosis [49, 50] and adding the details of complications for Parkinson's-related neurodegenerative disease to the analysis, may also aid in deciding whether shunt intervention is advisable.\nIn conclusion, preoperative CSF p-Tau levels predicted the long-term prognosis after shunt intervention in patients with iNPH. Improvements across all evaluated items, including mRS score, were maintained for three years after treatment in the low p-Tau group. In the high p-Tau group, improvement was observed in the early stage, peaked at six months, and gradually declined to or below preoperative levels. Therefore, shunt intervention in patients with iNPH with coexisting AD may be effective in the short term. The indication of shunt intervention for patients with iNPH whose symptoms improve for a limited period of time needs further study and discussion."}]
