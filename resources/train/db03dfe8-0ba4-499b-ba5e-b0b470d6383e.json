Changes in CSF Ab , t-tau and p-tau 181 concentrations reflect ongoing amyloidopathy (Ab ) and tauopathy as well as damage to neurons (t-tau and p-tau 181 ) in the brain [4, 15, 16, 22, 38, 40] . It is widely recognized that excessive analytical variability across laboratories and across time limits the potential use of these measures to assess the effects of candidate therapies on AD pathology in longitudinal, large world-wide clinical trials [8, 23, 24, 44] . ADNI is specifically designed to define longitudinal changes in imaging, biological markers, clinical and neuropsychological measurements in NCs as well as subjects who have late MCI or early AD to accelerate efforts to develop new treatments and monitor their effectiveness as well as lessen the time and cost of clinical trials. In order to accomplish this challenging goal the ADNI study adopted standardized biochemical and imaging biomarker methods in hopes of improving the ability to optimally detect the natural progression of neurodegenerative processes inherent in AD. Besides development of assays for novel analytes, the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) ADNI Biomarker Core laboratory has thoroughly studied measurement of Ab , t-tau and p-tau 181 in highly clinically annotated ADNI CSF samples to identify and attempt to control key sources of analytical variability.\nThis paper describes the analytical qualification of the INNO-BIA AlzBio3 immunoassay for use by the UPenn Biomarker Core for analyses of CSF samples collected from ADNI subjects. The multiplex xMAP Luminex platform (Luminex Corp, Austin, TX, USA) with Innogenetics (INNO-BIA AlzBio3, Ghent, Belgium) immunoassay reagents are for research use only. At first, different aspects of the analytical precision of the assays were evaluated including implementation of an inter-center qualification study (7 centers, including academic centers and industrial partners) to document the reproducibility and repeatability of the immunoassay using pooled CSF samples (n = 5) and aqueous validation samples (n = 3), evaluation of the long-term stability of CSF pools, and test/re-test analytical performance over time during the analyses of ADNI CSF samples. Second, the predictive performance of these CSF biomarkers was assessed for risk of progression from MCI to AD dementia. Finally, we discuss recognized pre-analytical factors that affect the results of these biomarker measurements."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this manuscript were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (http://www.loni.ucla.edu/ ADNI). The ADNI was launched in 2004 by the National Institute on Aging (NIA), the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), private pharmaceutical companies and non-profit organizations, as a $60 million, 5-year public-private partnership. The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), other biological markers and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early Alzheimer's disease (AD). Determination of sensitive and specific markers of very early AD progression is intended to aid researchers and clinicians to develop new treatments and monitor their effectiveness, as well as lessen the time and cost of clinical trials. The principal investigator of this initiative is Michael W. Weiner, MD, VA Medical Center and University of California-San Francisco.

The selection of the system was at the discretion of each participant and was not considered a variable in the study protocol. The xMAP Luminex technology is a flow cytometric method that allows simultaneous detection of several analytes on different sets of microspheres in a single well. Each set of microspheres has embedded a precise concentration ratio of red-and infrared fluorochromes, resulting in unique spectral identities. This allows flow cytometric discrimination of mixed microsphere sets [14, 28] ."}, {"section_title": "The INNO-BIA AlzBio3 immunoassay kits", "text": "The full details of the implementation of the INNO-BIA Alz Bio3 immunoassay reagents on the Luminex analytical platform are described elsewhere [29, 42] . Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are used in this assay, and the production process for the immunoassay kits includes in current production processes assurance of lot-to-lot consistency. These tests are relative quantitative assays for CSF Ab 1-42 , t-tau and p-tau 181 since no international reference standards for the analytes prepared in CSF are available. Each participating center used the same INNO-BIA AlzBio3 immunoassay kit (assay lot # 157353 and calibrator lot # 157379), provided for the study by Innogenetics, Ghent, Belgium. The kit reagents include a mixture of three xMAP color-coded carboxylated microspheres, each containing a bead set coupled with well-characterized capture mAbs specific for Ab 1-42 (4D7A3; bead region 56), t-tau (AT120; bead region 2) or p-tau 181 (AT270; bead region 69), and a vial with analyte-specific biotinylated detector mAbs (3D6 for Ab and HT7 for t-tau or p-tau 181 ). Ready-to-use vials containing pre-determined calibrator concentrations for the three analytes were provided. Calibration curves were produced for each biomarker using aqueous buffered solutions that contained the combination of three biomarkers at concentrations ranging from 56 to 1,948 pg/mL for recombinant t-tau, 27-1,574 pg/mL for synthetic Ab 1-42 and 8-230 pg/mL for a synthetic tau peptide phosphorylated at the threonine 181 position (the p-tau 181 standard; numbering according to the longest tau isoforms [13] ). In addition to the calibrators, the immunoassay kit includes two quality control samples, produced in aqueous diluent, with pre-defined acceptable concentration ranges for the three biomarkers.\nThe assay procedure A mixture of the microspheres were added to individual wells of 96-well plates followed by addition of 75 lL of sample (pooled CSF, calibrators, quality control samples) together with 25 lL of a mixture of the biotinylated detector mAbs (Conjugate 1). After an overnight incubation (protected from light; continuous shaking), at room temperature, the antigen-antibody complex was detected by a phycoerythrin-labeled streptavidin conjugate (Detection conjugate). Following a wash step, the signal associated with each analyte was measured by analyzing the resulting bead-capture antibody-analyte-detection antibody-detection conjugate complexes on the Luminex or BioPlex systems. The analyte-specific capture antibodies covalently coupled to spectrally unique microspheric beads provide analytical specificity. The analyte concentration is related to the fluorescence intensity derived from complexed detection conjugates.\nInter-lab study design Aqueous calibrators and controls are included in the immunoassay kit. Analyses were also performed on separate aqueous validation and human subject CSF pool samples (generated by using residual CSF samples obtained from individuals who were not part of the ADNI cohort). All calibrators, controls and additional samples were analyzed in duplicate in each run. A result (a reported value) was defined as the arithmetic mean of duplicate results. For each of the five CSF pool aliquots, there were two sets of duplicates, i.e., there were four replicates for each of these samples. Each participating laboratory performed three analytical runs using separate frozen, not previously thawed aliquots of each of the three aqueous validation and five CSF pools in each run. The aqueous samples, X-1, X-2 and X-3, were prepared by Innogenetics and contained different concentrations of reference materials [(synthetic peptides, Ab 1-42 and p-tau 181 ) or recombinant protein (total tau)] spiked into diluent. Five CSF pools were prepared at the UPenn ADNI Biomarker Core laboratory. Three of the CSF pools, X-41, X-42 and X-43, were prepared from excess routine clinic patient samples, and they also were included in the pre-qualification study. Two other CSF pools, X-40 and X-44, were prepared from aliquots collected from AD patients who were not in the ADNI cohort. The homogeneity of aliquots prepared from the CSF pools was verified prior to the start of the study. The aqueous run validation and the CSF pool aliquots were stored in labeled polypropylene tubes at -80\u00b0C. Three each of these aliquots were shipped on dry ice to each participating center with a temperature sensor attached to each shipment container to provide assurance of maintenance of temperature during transit.\nFor each of the three analytical runs, a test protocol was followed and checklist information provided to assure compliance with test procedure steps and conditions by the seven participating laboratories.

These AD biomarkers emerged from a number of earlier studies as prime candidate analytes for inclusion or exclusion criteria of demented or MCI patients in clinical trials of investigational drugs for treatment of AD. These markers are also of potential interest for use in stratification criteria for the assessment of treatment effects of investigational, disease modifying therapies that target Ab and tau AD neurodegeneration (for recent reviews see [16, 17, 21, 35, 41, 43] ). However, experience with a number of CSF tau and Ab immunoassays reported in the literature reveals significant measurement variability linked to the following: lack of strict consistent adherence to the assay method protocol; inconsistent manufacture of reagents; differences in analytical test procedures; matrix effects confounding spike recovery and linearity with sample dilutions. A host of preanalytical issues, including but not limited to patient preparation and CSF sample acquisition, processing and storage also contribute to the variability of reported results [5, 8, 23, 24, 26, 34, 44] . Additionally, there is an overall measurement bias in all commercially available kits because currently available calibrators are prepared in buffer matrixes, rather than authentic CSF or artificial equivalents thereof that are free of matrix interactions.\nTo address these issues here, we evaluated the interlaboratory performance achieved with the Innogenetics AlzBio3 immunoassay on the xMAP Luminex platform in seven participating laboratories. The samples tested included aliquots prepared from five pools of human CSF in addition to aqueous controls. Each laboratory performed three analytical runs using not previously thawed aliquots for each of the five CSF pools. Using mixed-effects modeling to analyze precision across the seven participating laboratories for these five CSF pools the mean withinlaboratory %CV for these five CSF pools were 5.3% for Ab 1-42 , 6 .7% for t-tau and 10.8% for p-tau 181 , thereby demonstrating the level of reproducibility a laboratory can expect, on average, for CSF analyses based on the AlzBio3 reagents and the Luminex analytical platform. The UPenn ADNI Biomarker Core laboratory measurement of CSF Ab 1-42 , t-tau and p-tau 181 in ADNI CSF sample aliquots was performed over a series of analytical runs (n = 36 for CSF pool X-45 and n = 51 for CSF pool X-52) using three different lots of manufactured reagent kits. These additional data demonstrated very good within-laboratory interday precision, thereby confirming and expanding the within-laboratory reproducibility initially demonstrated in the inter-laboratory study.\nThe average inter-laboratory precision for the five CSF pools was 17.9% for Ab 1-42 , 13.1% for t-tau and 14.6% for p-tau 181 . Further studies are required to fully explain the increased variability between centers as compared to within-center reproducibility. Since this is a multistep procedure, there are several manipulations in the procedure that could be a source for variability in the biomarker test results either individually or in specific combinations. Examples include sample handling, e.g., the time and temperature used for thawing CSF aliquots and the mixing procedure intended to assure uniform sample composition; composition of pipetting materials and pipetting technique; incubation conditions including the time and temperature of the overnight incubation and the vacuum pressure utilized in plate washing steps. We believe that certain factors, e.g., silanized pipet tip versus standard polypropylene tip, are not likely a major factor for the Ab 1-42 measurement variability since using three CSF pools we obtained a mean difference in results for Ab of only 1% using the silanized sample pipet tips versus polypropylene, thus precluding adsorption of Ab to non-silanized pipet tips as a likely factor, and use of silanized sample tips did not give rise to higher concentrations of either t-tau or p-tau 181 . The vacuum pressure for plate washing steps varied among the seven participating laboratories from 2.2 to 9.0 in Hg. We tested for the effect on results of varying plate washing vacuum pressure on aliquots from six CSF pools in a series of experiments testing each of four plate washing vacuum pressures (2, 5, 6 and 9 in Hg) and found modest average differences that were within the run to run variability of the method (unpublished results). The temperatures used for the overnight incubation step by participating laboratories (19-24\u00b0C) were well within the acceptable range specified by the manufacturer. Another potential source of variability is the type of material used in the manufacture of aliquot tubes. Glass and polystyrene surfaces are prone to adsorb Ab and to a lesser degree t-tau in comparison to polypropylene [1, 24] , but recent studies have detected significant differences between polypropylene tubes made by different manufacturers [3, 31] . However, since the polypropylene aliquot tubes used in this study were the same lot number and manufacturer, the CSF aliquot tube type was not a source of variability here, but other possible factors (e.g., pipetting technique, pipet tip manufacturer and materials) require further investigation to assess their possible effects on these biomarker measurements and were beyond the scope of this study.\nNotwithstanding the multiple factors potentially impacting analytical performance of the AlzBio3 on the Luminex platform, the results reported herein represent a significant improvement in inter-laboratory reproducibility relative to previously reported multiple center assessments of this commercially available assay kit and analytical platform combination [23, 44] . The clinical implications of this are important. Diagnostic cutpoints were developed using this analytically qualified immunoassay system and ante-mortem CSF samples from non-ADNI patients with an autopsy confirmed diagnosis of AD and age-matched NCs from a non-ADNI clinical cohort, e.g., Ab was abnormal in 90% of ADNI subjects with probable AD [36] , and Ab and t-tau/Ab 1-42 were abnormal in 90.2 or 92.7%, respectively, in ADNI MCI subjects who progressed to AD (unpublished observation on ADNI data as of 6/30/2010) and differentiated progressors from non-progressors in the ADNI MCI cohort as demonstrated in this investigation. The Fig. 5 Linear regression plots of concentrations, measured in never previously thawed CSF aliquots from 118 ADNI subjects, utilizing 2-3 subjects randomly selected from each of 38 analytical runs. For each randomly selected subject, a second never previously thawed aliquot was included in the run following analysis of the first never previously thawed aliquot. In plots a-c, the current study is significant because it defines parameters that set the stage for further refinements of CSF tau and Ab assay performance, thereby offering the prospect of wider use of these assays including the analysis of specimens from transgenic mouse models of AD-like tau and Ab pathologies and the analysis of specimens from AD patients, MCI patients and cognitively normal subjects participating in clinical research studies to evaluate the diagnostic utility of the methods themselves and the therapeutic impact of investigational therapies for the treatment and prevention of AD. These promising findings together with advances in standardizing AD imaging methods prompt us to speculate that ante-mortem measures of CSF t-tau, p-tau 181 and Ab , together with MRI and amyloid imaging biomarkers in probable AD patients, could replace autopsy confirmation of AD plaque and tangle pathology as the ''gold standard'' for the diagnosis of definite AD in the near future.\nAcknowledgments Data collection and sharing for this project was funded by the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) Fig. 6 Kaplan-Meier time to conversion to AD survival curves for ADNI subjects who had a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment at their baseline visit.
