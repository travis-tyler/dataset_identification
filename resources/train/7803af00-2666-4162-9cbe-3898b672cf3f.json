[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Many neuroimaging studies collect functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data in a longitudinal manner. However, the current network modeling literature lacks a general framework for analyzing functional connectivity (FC) networks in fMRI data obtained from a longitudinal study. In this work, we build a novel longitudinal FC network model using a variance components approach. First, for all subjects' visits, we account for the autocorrelation inherent in the fMRI time series data using a non-parametric technique. Second, we use a generalized least squares approach to estimate 1) the within-subject variance component shared across the population, 2) the FC network, and 3) the FC network's longitudinal trend. Our novel method for longitudinal FC networks seeks to account for the within-subject dependence across multiple visits, the variability due to the subjects being sampled from a population, and the autocorrelation present in fMRI data, while restricting the number of parameters in order to make the method computationally feasible and stable. We develop a permutation testing procedure to draw valid inference on group differences in baseline FC and change in FC over time between a set of patients and a comparable set of controls. To examine performance, we run a series of simulations and apply the model to longitudinal fMRI data collected from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database."}, {"section_title": "Introduction 1.Resting-State fMRI", "text": "Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) captures a series of images of the brain in subjects who are not given a particular task to perform while in the scanner. The scanner repeatedly captures blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signals at hundreds of thousands of locations within the brain, creating a time series of images of the brain. By capturing the BOLD signal of the resting brain, resting-state fMRI provides an opportunity for researchers to examine the functional connectivity (FC) network not tied to a particular task. We define FC as the temporal dependence, measured through cross-correlations, in the BOLD signals between brain regions [Friston et al., 1993] . Identifying group differences in FC can help better understand the underlying neurological process of a disease and its progression. Observed group differences can also potentially form biomarkers to be used for early detection and treatment of neurological disorders [Fox and Raichle, 2007 ]."}, {"section_title": "Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative Data", "text": "A subset of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data was used to demonstrate a practical application of our model.

There are two groups of interest, the cognitively normal (CN) group and the Alzheimer's Disease (AD) group. We focused our attention on late-onset AD and included only patients who were 65 years of age or older at baseline [van der Flier Figure 1 : Spaghetti plots of the correlation between two ROIs against age.

[2015] found decreased network FC for CN patients who progressed to MCI over the following 24 months compared to non-progressers. These previous works, however, used cross-sectional models. Our work will build off of these results on the clinical utility of FC as a biomarker for AD."}, {"section_title": "Methodological Considerations", "text": "Of the studies mentioned in Section 1.3, only Ren et al. [2016] utilized truly longitudinal fMRI data. Aging effects are often measured by comparing young and ederly groups rather than following one group of subjects over time. A comprehensive longitudinal model that tests for differences in baseline and trend is needed to verify and expand on the previous results. Finn and Constable [2016] demonstrated that CN patients have distinct brain signatures in fMRI images, implying that separate scans from a single individual exhibit dependence. This finding can be leveraged in a longitudinal framework to better model aging effects. Our new methodology analyzes fMRI data at the region of interest (ROI) level. Thus, before fitting the model, the investigator must select a number of ROIs to include in the FC network analysis. We motivate the challenges of longitudinal FC network analysis with a preliminary examination of the ADNI data. Figure 1 shows spaghetti plots of the FC between the preprocessed fMRI time series obtained from two ROI pairs for the AD and CN groups. The clustering of points within each line shows the within-subject dependence. In addition, there is considerable within-subject and within-group noise present in the estimates of FC. What is not evident from the figure is that the time series from which these correlations were obtained exhibit autocorrelation that contributes to the overall variability in FC. To add another level of complication, the figure depicts the marginal relationship between two ROIs, but to properly model the entire network we need a joint model that considers the network of all possible pairwise groupings of the chosen ROIs.\nWhile methods such as Fiecas et al. [2017] exist for the cross-sectional case, no modeling framework exists for longitudinal FC network analysis. We fill this gap in the literature by proposing a novel longitudinal model and inference procedure that considers the network of all possible pairwise groupings of the chosen ROIs in resting-state fMRI data. Our longitudinal variance components FC network model accounts for the within-subject dependence across multiple visits, the variability due to the subjects being sampled from a population, and any autocorrelation present in fMRI time series. We also propose an efficient permutation based inference procedure that allows for valid hypothesis testing of group differences in baseline FC networks and FC network aging effects.\nThe remainder of the paper is laid out as follows. Section 2 formally introduces the model, including the estimation and inference procedures. Section 3 explains the design of the simulation study and discusses the results. Section 4 more fully describes the ADNI data, specifies the models fit to the data, and interprets the results of the FC analysis.

We collect a P -variate, fMRI time series of length T from the preprocessed fMRI images of each of the N subjects at each visit. Let the subscripts i and j denote subject and visit, respectively. A particular subject returns for Ji total visits, and the cohort has a total of J = N i=1 Ji visits. Let Yi represent the vector of sample correlation coefficients for subject i of length QJi, where Q = P (P \u2212 1)/2 is the number of ROI pairs. Within Yi, the Q correlations from the first visit, Yi1, are followed by the Q correlations from the second visit, Yi2, and so on until the Ji-th visit. The full response vector Y is formed by stacking the N different Yi vectors. Our longitudinal model for the FC network is a linear model with baseline effect \u03b20 and longitudinal trend \u03b21, where each of these model parameters are vectors of length Q. We denote the time at visit j for subject i as vij. The vector vi is formed by stacking the Ji distinct vij \u2297 1Q vectors for subject i, where 1Q is a vector of ones of length Q. Likewise v is formed by stacking the N distinct vi vectors. Depending on the nature of the data and the research questions at hand, vij can be set to the visit number, the time since baseline, or the patient's age. Then, denoting element-wise multiplication with * , our model has the following linear form:\n(1)\nThe key element in our longitudinal linear model is the variance structure of the error term. We separate the error variance into two components, \u03a3 and \u03a8. \u03a3 accounts for the within-visit variance and the temporal autocorrelation in the fMRI time series, and \u03a8 accounts for the variability and covariability arising from the heterogeneity across subjects and the within-subject covariation coming from the longitudinal design. \u03a3 is block diagonal where each Q \u00d7 Q block, \u03a3ij, accounts for the within-visit variance present in visit j for subject i for the Q pairs of ROIs. \u03a8 is also block diagonal with a QJi \u00d7 QJi block for participant i. These diagonal blocks do not differ between subjects except through their dimensions which depends on the number of visits for each subject. Let \u03a8 diag be an arbitrary diagonal block of \u03a8. We then further break \u03a8 diag into two components, \u03a80 and \u03a81. \u03a80 is a Q \u00d7 Q block that is repeated along the diagonal of each \u03a8 diag . This term models the within-visit covariability not captured by \u03a3. \u03a81 is a Q \u00d7 Q block that populates the off diagonal blocks of \u03a8 diag , modeling the within-subject, across-visit covariability coming from the longitudinal design.\nWe write Equation 1 in the form of a linear model with a vector response, allowing us to use existing methods for estimating the parameters and for statistical inference. To this end, our model can also be written in the standard linear model form with a design matrix X. Let Xij = [1 vij] \u2297 IQ, where IQ is the Q \u00d7 Q identity matrix. To form Xi, the portion of the design matrix specific to subject i, we stack the Ji individual Xij. Likewise, to form X we stack the N individual Xi. If we define \u03b2 as a vector of length 2Q where the first Q elements are \u03b20 and the last Q elements are \u03b21, then Equation 1 can be written as Y = X\u03b2 + \u03b5. Figure 2 shows a workflow chart of the procedure used to estimate the model parameters and test hypotheses which are subsequently described in more detail.

Here the first subscript on w indicates the ROI and the second subscript indicates the time within the time series. Then for the p-th and q-th ROIs, where p, q \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , P }, we have\nWe now seek a consistent estimator of the covariance between correlations of two ROI pairs, (p, q) and (p , q ). The estimator of Melard et al. [1991] and Roy [1989] offers a nice solution which accounts for the autocorrelation present in fMRI time series and is consistent under mild conditions. First, define\u03b3pq(u) = T \u2212u t=1 (wpt \u2212wp)(wq,t+u \u2212wq)/T . Then, letting h(\u00b7) be the modified Bartlett window with bandwidth b(T ), we set\u0398(p, q, p , q ) = T \u22121 u=\u2212T +1 h 2 (u)\u03b3pq(u)\u03b3 p q (u).

The block compound symmetry assumption keeps the parameter space to a reasonable size, but note that one could easily consider other forms of \u03a8, such as an autoregressive structure, with minimal modification to the estimation procedure. We use the ordinary least squares estimator\u03b2 = (X X) \u22121 X Y to provide a good starting estimate of \u03b2. We then update the two components of \u03a8 using the following formulas:\nNote how these estimators resemble the mean squared error. For\u03a80, the sum of the squared residuals for all visits are summed. We then subtract the previously estimated\u03a3ij and divide the remaining covariance matrix by the total number of visits to get\u03a80. We estimate \u03a81 in a similar fashion. In this case, we calculate and average the cross products of the residuals from all pairs of visits for each subject. We do not subtract a\u03a3 term here because\u03a3 has been set to 0 for the off diagonal blocks occupied by \u03a81. These simple estimators, obtained through matching moments, significantly reduce computation in comparison to a maximum likelihood approach. To increase model parsimony, different structures can be considered for \u03a3ij, \u03a80, and \u03a81. For example, to enforce a diagonal structure, set all off-diagonal elements to 0, or to enforce a compound symmetry structure, set all diagonal elements to the average of the diagonal elements and likewise for the off-diagonal elements [Laird, 2004] .\nChanging the form of \u03a3ij, \u03a80, and \u03a81 allows you to fit the model with flexible variance assumptions as is often done in traditional generalized least squares linear models.\nWith an estimate of \u03a8 obtained using Equations 3 and 4, we can now use the standard GLS formula to update the regression coefficients as follows:\u03b2 = {X (\u03a3 +\u03a8) \u22121 X} \u22121 X (\u03a3 +\u03a8) \u22121 Y . At this point we have two choices: iteratively update\u03a8 and\u03b2 until convergence (full convergence), or accept the estimates (one-step) and proceed with the inferential procedure. The one-step estimator provides a significant advantage in computing time as\u03a8 and\u03b2 must be estimated for each permutation of the inference procedure [Ganjgahi et al., 2015] . Additionally, Amemiya [1977] proved that the one-step GLS estimator maintains consistency.\nWe estimate\u03b2,\u03a8, and\u03a3 for each group (CN and AD for ADNI) separately using this estimation procedure. Superscripts on the parameter estimates denote the group (e.g.\u03b2 G 1 ,\u03a8 G 1 , and\u03a3 G 1 are the estimates for group 1)."}, {"section_title": "Inference", "text": "Two general hypothesis tests are of interest in a longitudinal FC model: the group difference in the baseline FC, and the group difference in the longitudinal trend in FC. For each hypothesis, we would like to test for the significance of the group difference in both the global FC network and the local ROI pair FC. We refer to the vector wide test of a difference in the parameter vector \u03b20 or \u03b21 as a global test and refer to a test of a group difference in a single element of \u03b20 or \u03b21 as a local test. To accomplish our hypothesis testing objectives, we use the Wald statistic,\n, and adjust the contrast matrix, C, depending on the hypothesis of interest. For instance, to test for a global difference in \u03b20, we replace all \u03b2 terms with the \u03b20 vector for the proper group and set the contrast matrix, C, to the Q \u00d7 Q identity matrix.\nWe estimate the variance of each group's regression coefficients using Var(\u03b2) = {X (\u03a3 +\u03a8) \u22121 X} \u22121 .

The number of permutations determines the precision of the p-value and should be chosen to be large enough to offer sufficient precision after any multiple comparisons adjustment. In our particular data example we chose to run 5,000 permutations. Because the obtained p-values are estimated discrete values, we additionally use the permutation p-value correction procedure of Phipson et al. [2010] . To account for the fact that 2Q local hypotheses are tested simultaneously, we then apply the false discovery rate (FDR) controlling procedure of Benjamini and Hochberg [1995] to the corrected p-values from the local tests. The Phipson et al. [2010] correction helps avoid unadjusted p-values with value 0 which may improperly maintain significance after a multiple comparisons correction. Chung and Romano [2013] showed that studentized test statistics, such as the proposed Wald statistic, allow for valid inference in many permutation test settings. A recent comparison of the performance of different permutation strategies by Winkler et al. [2014] showed that the Ter Braak permutation testing procedure we use maintains nominal Type I error and is fairly robust [Ter Braak, 1992] . This method offers the additional advantage that the data only needs to be permuted once and the model only fit twice at each iteration of the permutation test to test all local and global hypotheses. Testing all hypotheses under a single permutation schedule greatly reduces the computational burden of the testing procedure."}, {"section_title": "Simulation Study", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Simulation Setup", "text": "A series of simulations were designed with different data generating mechanisms to assess model performance. In all scenarios each time series contained 120 time points and had an autocorrelation structure that followed a first-order autoregressive process with an AR parameter of 0.3. A multivariate time series was simulated for each subject at three visits. For each visit, the Q correlations were simulated from a multivariate normal distribution where the mean and variance varied by group based on the simulation setting. For group 1, the mean vector was always assumed to be 0 and the covariance matrix was the same across all simulation settings. The simulations used P of either 3, 5, or 10 as the dimension of the multivariate normal distribution. For the 3 and 5 dimension settings only the first element of the group 2 mean vector was allowed to vary by simulation setting, while the other elements were set to match group 1. For the 10 dimension settings the first 5 elements of the group 2 mean vector varied by simulation setting and the other elements were again set to match group 1. 1,000 Monte Carlo simulations were run for all simulation settings with 3 and 5 dimensions, and 500 simulations were run for the 10 dimensional simulation settings. Group sizes of 15 and 30 were considered. The true variance of the correlations was either equal for the two groups or the group 2 variance was double the group 1 variance. 500 permutations were used for the permutation test for all settings. The group size, number of visits, and time series length were selected to reflect values found in typical fMRI studies. The effect size of 0.1 is realistic for fMRI longitudinal scenarios. Considering a smaller effect size would lead to very similar conclusions with slight decreases in power across all models considered.\nAs mentioned earlier, there are no other competitor models which consider FC networks longitudinally. Because of this, we have chosen to fit three versions of our model with different variance assumptions and estimation methods so they can be compared to each other. The first model considered was a full convergence model which iterated between\u03a8 and\u03b2 until convergence. It assumed an unstructured \u03a3ij and compound symmetry for \u03a80 and \u03a81. This model is referred to as the full convergence full variance model. The second was a one-step model which stops after one iteration of solving for\u03a8 and\u03b2. It also assumed an unstructured \u03a3ij and compound symmetry for \u03a80 and \u03a81 and is referred to as the one-step convergence full variance model. The final model was a one-step model which assumed a diagonal structure for \u03a3ij and scaled identity structures for \u03a80 and \u03a81. This last model is referred to as the one-step convergence reduced variance model."}, {"section_title": "Simulation Results", "text": "Tables 1 and 2 show the simulation study results. Table 1 shows the global and local Type I error for the main effect and interaction across all simulations. The reported global test results are the average global Type I errors across 500 or 1,000 Monte Carlo runs. The local test results are the average Type I errors of the unadjusted p-values for all null hypotheses across the 500 or 1,000 Monte Carlo runs. While the local p-values would be adjusted in practice, the numbers in the table provide easy reference to a nominal Type I error of 0.05. Table 2 shows the average global power and average local power using false discovery rate adjusted p-values. All p-values were corrected using the method of Phipson et al. [2010] . Additional simulation study results can be found in Web Table 1 of web-based supplementary materials. Table 1 shows roughly nominal Type I error rates for all three model specification. While there was some slight inflation in all three models, especially for the 10 ROI simulations, the inflation was attenuated by the increase in sample size from 15 to 30 per group. Table 2 demonstrates adequate power, both locally and globally for all three models. As expected, power increased with larger group size and decreased with a larger true group 2 variance.\nThere was no consistent difference in performance between the three models in terms of power or Type I error across the different simulation settings. The two full variance settings match the true model of the simulated data, yet the reduced variance model did not suffer in comparison. The reduced variance model may have offered similar performance because the smaller parameter space allowed for improved estimation. The reduced variance model did not capture the full true variance, but it still performed well by allowing the FC for each ROI pair to be correlated across multiple visits for a given subject. Overall, the full convergence results did not consistently improve on the one-step estimator results. With negligible gains in terms of power and Type I error, the additional computational resources used by the fullconvergence model did not offer any practical advantage. A primary difference in the three models was the computational time. The full convergence model took, on average, over 2.5 times longer to run without seeing any boost in performance. For reference, using a 3.7 GHz Quad-Core Intel Xeon with 16GB ram, the average times to fit the one-step full variance model with 30 subjects per group for 3, 5, and 10 ROIs were 3.8 seconds, 54.9 seconds, and 87.2 minutes, respectively. These results show that the time increases quickly with the dimension of the model. The computational time is largely driven by the permutation procedure. Thus, if a larger number of permutations is desired for the testing procedure, then the computational time will see a corresponding increase."}, {"section_title": "ADNI Data Analysis", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "ADNI Preprocessing", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the ADNI database (http://adni.loni.usc.edu).

We define the ROI level time series for a given region as the average of the time series from each voxel (3D location) within that region of the brain.

The nearly identical results provide further support of the conclusion from the simulation study that the full convergence and one-step estimator models lead to very similar estimates and inference.

While the significant results disappear after FDR correction for Model 2, the fact that many other HC/PHC connections with the PCC see a similar pattern helps to indicate differing baseline and longitudinal trend effects in the FC of the two groups.

The linear model framework and utilization of generalized least squares estimators offers great simplicity and a large number of natural extensions. This work fills a current gap in the literature by providing a general framework for estimation and hypothesis testing of longitudinal FC data. As a practical example, we applied the method to resting-state fMRI data from the ADNI database. Our analysis found a faster decline in FC between the HCl and the PCCr in AD patients compared to the CN controls. This finding confirms the results of previous studies and helps solidify the central roles of the hippocampus and default mode network in AD.\nOur familiar linear model framework allows for easy adoption and understanding of the model and its results. Additionally, the linear model framework offers many natural extensions. One could easily include terms for additional covariates such as scanner effect or gender. Different structures for the variance components could also be implemented to capture a wider range of possible correlation structures.\nOur current method has the advantage of allowing for joint modeling of a complete FC network rather than taking a massive univariate approach. We see this joint modeling as a significant step forward, but complete brain analyses are still not yet feasible due to high computational demands of a model fit to many ROIs and the limited sample size of many fMRI studies. Here we have fit models to 10 ROI networks, but many brain atlases include more than 100 regions. In the future, some form of regularization could be introduced into the model to allow for analysis of an entire brain atlas. The ability to run a full brain FC network analysis would alleviate the issues arising from ROI selection.\nThe selection of the proper structure for the variance components deserves more attention. While a block compound symmetry structure for \u03a8 has a natural interpretation similar to that of a random intercept, there are certainly other viable structures. Choosing between structures is not a trivial task. One way to alleviate the model selection dilemma is to introduce a more robust sandwich type estimator of Var(\u03b2), in which case incorrect specification of the variance would lead to valid inference with only a reduction in power."}]
