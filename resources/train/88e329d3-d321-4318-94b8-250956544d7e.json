We excluded single case reports.\nStream 2 consisted of systematic reviews published in 2017 or later that synthesized randomized trial evidence from patients with acute hypoxic respiratory failure who were critically ill but had neither suspected or confirmed COVID-19, MERS, or SARS. We included only recent credible systematic reviews (assessed by using AMSTAR 2 [A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews 2]) because we intended to focus on up-to-date indirect evidence, and older reviews would not have included the most recent studies. We summarized the results of those reviews that are most credible (moderate- or high-quality rating on AMSTAR 2).\nIn streams 3 and 4, to identify all evidence about the risk for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through AGPs, we evaluated additional streams of evidence. In stream 3, we selected controlled studies (animal, human, mechanistic, laboratory, preclinical, and simulation, among others) evaluating aerosol dispersion to inform the evidence about transmission of virus in confirmed cases of COVID-19, MERS, or SARS. We focused on COVID-19 in summarizing evidence, but if that evidence was sparse, we decided a priori to summarize evidence for MERS and SARS. For stream 4, we included all primary studies dealing with SARS, MERS, or COVID-19 published after 22 October 2010 (date of prior search) (2). This update focused on transmission of virus.\nFor all 4 streams, the reviewers pilot-tested a standardized title and abstract screening form by using the same citations.

Supplement 3 shows the PRISMA flow diagram. Of these, 121 studies did not provide adequate data for extraction\u2014for example, because outcome data could not be attributed to a specific treatment group. Supplement 4 shows a description of these studies. Of the remaining 28 studies (11 on COVID-19, 15 on SARS, 2 on MERS) that had data for extraction (12, 21\u201347), 18 included NIV as a treatment of choice (Supplement 5). Only 5 studies (including 1 very small RCT) provided results that we judged as adequately adjusted for important confounders, such as comorbidities or severity of hypoxemia (3 on SARS, 1 on COVID-19, and 1 on MERS) (12, 21, 29, 31, 32). We considered the remaining 23 unadjusted studies as providing results at high risk of bias. This included the 10 studies in patients with COVID-19 that reported unadjusted results.\nWe judged the risk of bias (Supplements 4 and 5 as low for the cohort designs on the basis of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, but in our GRADE assessment, we accounted for the risks of selection and confounding bias due to the nonrandomized design, and we noted some concerns for the RCT. We judged the 23 unadjusted studies, including all COVID-19 studies, to be at moderate to high risk of bias because any estimate of effect will be subject to strong confounding and selection bias. Furthermore, we identified studies for which there was no clear comparison, mostly defined as case series or case reports, which were generally at high risk of bias (Supplement 5).\n\nSupplement 6 shows the results of the studies with extractable data. Five studies reported adjusted results, one of them in patients with COVID-19. In these latter studies, 3 studies compared NIV with IMV and 2 studies compared NIV with no mechanical ventilation. The respective results from the former 3 studies (Figure 1) differ and suggest an imprecise increase in mortality in NIV compared with IMV in 1 study (COVID-19: hazard ratio, 1.61 [95% CI, 0.84 to 3.09]) and a reduction in mortality in 2 studies (MERS and SARS: OR, 0.61 [CI, 0.23 to 1.6] and 0.24 [CI, 0.10 to 0.72], respectively) (very low certainty of the evidence secondary to the nonrandomized study designs and concerns about inconsistency) (21, 29, 31). We were unable to perform a meta-analysis because of differences in how authors reported the effect estimates. For NIV compared with no mechanical ventilation, the RCT (32) suggested a reduction in mortality, but there were only 3 events in 60 patients in total, causing imprecision, and the nonrandomized study by Xu and colleagues (12) also showed a reduction in mortality (OR, 0.21 [CI, 0.09 to 0.47]; low certainty, owing to very serious imprecision of the RCT and the nonrandomized study design of the other study) (Figure 2).\nThe 10 additional studies in COVID-19 presented only unadjusted results. In the only study from Italy, Duca and associates (25) reported a higher death rate in patients receiving helmet CPAP or other NIV compared with IMV. For the 3 studies from China, Liao and coworkers (28) reported rates of recovery greater than 40% after 28 days of follow-up in patients who received NIV, HFNC, and conventional oxygen therapy. Wang and colleagues (29) found low rates of the need for IMV in patients receiving NIV or HFNC. Mortality was greater than 60% in the NIV group and was 100% in the IMV group in the study by Wu and associates (30). We did not calculate effect estimates for these latter studies, given the high risk for confounding and selection bias as well as other potential biases in these studies. We found only 1 study on contextual factors, which reported a 2.5-fold higher cost for patients with SARS treated with mechanical versus no mechanical ventilation from 2004. We found no studies that provided information on any of the contextual factors for decision making about NIV in COVID-19."}, {"section_title": "Stream 2: Overview of Systematic Reviews of Randomized Trials That Assessed the Efficacy of NIV Approaches in Patients With Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure Not Due to Coronavirus Infection ::: Results", "text": "We identified 12 systematic reviews of indirect study populations that were judged to be credible on the basis of assessment with the AMSTAR 2 instrument (rating of moderate or high quality). Supplement 7 provides the full ratings, and Supplement 3 shows the PRISMA flow chart. Consultation with our 7 content experts who are involved in care of patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure, including those with COVID-19, identified no additional systematic review that would have superseded the identified reviews, but 5 of these reviews included study populations that we judged as too indirect on final review (48\u201352)\u2014for example, because they were studies in postsurgery patients or those with cardiogenic pulmonary edema only (Supplement 7). We found no systematic review comparing IMV with NIV. We found no studies allowing us to draw conclusions about the indirect comparative efficacy of CPAP or BiPAP in COVID-19.\nTwo systematic reviews (53, 54) concluded that RCTs suggest a large reduction in mortality of NIV compared with conventional oxygen therapy for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (Supplement 7). We included 4 systematic reviews of RCTs that compared HFNC, which is considered a NIV strategy by many content experts, with conventional oxygen therapy for adults (55\u201358) and 1 in children (59). The results overall suggested no reduction in mortality but a reduction in the need for IMV with the administration of HFNC. Compared with other NIV, 2 of the reviews of RCTs in adults (56, 57) suggested that HFNC had no effect on mortality or escalation of ventilatory support, including the need for intubation. The RCTs included in 1 review suggested that helmets are at least as efficacious as the use of facemasks in NIV (53). In children, the risk for treatment failure and mortality appeared to be increased with HFNC compared with CPAP (59) (Supplement 7)."}, {"section_title": "Stream 3: Systematic Review of Mechanistic, Animal, Human, Foundational Science, Preclinical and Other Studies Describing the Risk for Transmission From AGPs ::: Results", "text": "To determine the risk for transmission of COVID-19, we conducted a systematic review of mechanistic, animal, human, preclinical, laboratory, and other studies and identified 25 102 citations; Supplement 3 shows the PRISMA flow chart for the included studies. We included 6 studies assessing the presence or transmission of the 3 coronaviruses in different environments: MERS-CoV (2 studies) (60, 61), SARS-CoV (1 study) (62), and SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 (3 studies) (63\u201365). Wan and colleagues (62) studied droplet distribution of SARS-CoV when a patients with SARS used a humidifier or a large-volume nebulizer and found that none of the air samples had SARS-CoV\u2013specific DNA products. One study found that SARS-CoV-2 persisted up to 16 hours in airborne form (64), and another reported a higher rate of SARS-CoV-2 detection in the intensive care setting where patients were ventilated (67% of air outlet swab samples and 44% of swab surface samples) (65). Adhikari and coworkers (60) modeled the transmission of MERS-CoV to HCWs visiting an index patient, other patients sharing the same room, and family visitors. The risk was highest among HCWs and mostly depended on the concentration of MERS-CoV in the saliva. Pyankov and associates (61) used a virus-containing suspension aerosolized to an experimental aerosol chamber to compare, under controlled laboratory conditions, particle size and viable concentration of MERS-CoV in 2 different environments. They found higher evaporation and lower survival under hot and dry climatic conditions. Similarly, Bae and colleagues (63) found that coughing induces dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 and masks did not prevent colonization at a distance of 20 cm."}, {"section_title": "Stream 4: Update of Systematic Reviews of Human Studies Evaluating the Effect of AGPs ::: Results", "text": "In 2011, CADTH produced a rapid response report that systematically reviewed the risk for transmission of acute respiratory infection to HCWs exposed to patients undergoing AGPs (2). The review included 5 case\u2013control studies and 5 cohort studies evaluating the risk for SARS transmission to HCWs during AGPs (Supplements 8, 9, and 10). Only 4 of these studies provided adjusted effect estimates. The studies found large increases in the odds of SARS-CoV infection among HCWs performing or being present during tracheal intubation, or in HCWs performing chest compressions (66\u201369). Unadjusted studies reported an increased risk for transmission with tracheal intubation, NIV, manipulation of a BiPAP mask, and manual ventilation before intubation. Other AGPs were not associated with transmission in that report: endotracheal aspiration, suction of body fluids, bronchoscopy, nebulizer treatment, administration of oxygen, high-flow oxygen, defibrillation, insertion of nasogastric tube, and collection of sputum (Supplement 11).\nOur update of this review identified 15 new studies (6 on COVID-19 and 9 on MERS), but these studies had high risk of bias (Supplements 12 and 13; Supplement 3 shows the PRISMA flow diagram). Most studies used real-time polymerase chain reaction to ascertain presence of virus. Three studies found no cases of transmission to HCWs in the following AGPs: bronchoscope-guided endotracheal intubation through nasal insertion (70); tracheostomy (71); endotracheal intubation, extubation, or NIV; and exposure to aerosols in an open circuit (72). Two additional studies reported no important association between the proportions of HCWs contracting acute respiratory illness in high-risk exposure versus other exposure in COVID-19 (73, 74), but another found that being present during or assisting with AGPs (nebulizer treatment or BiPAP) was more common among HCWs with COVID-19 (75). One study found a 11% infection rate among anesthetists who had direct contact with patients with COVID-19 who received oxygen via nasal cannula (76). Hall and colleagues (77) reported no infection among HCWs reporting contact with patients with MERS-CoV, although a proportion of them had been present during AGPs (airway suction, nebulizer treatment, sputum induction, bronchoscopy, and intubation). Alraddadi and associates (78) reported different rates of infection among HCWs in direct contact with patients and among those performing AGPs, and 2 case reports (79, 80) described infection with MERS-CoV after being present at cardiac resuscitations and having face-to-face contact with a febrile HCW. However, these findings need to be interpreted with great caution, owing to a probable confounding effect of personal protective equipment (PPE) use and variable methods and reporting (81\u201384)."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "This systematic review evaluating different ventilation strategies identified 28 original comparative studies in patients with SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. Although an additional 34 studies in patients with COVID-19 were found, their methods and reporting were too poor for us to synthesize data appropriately. Together, the indirect evidence, including 7 systematic reviews in other populations, suggests that NIV may reduce mortality or need for IMV, with similar effects to IMV. However, the use of NIV and the choice of the ventilation strategy must be balanced against the potentially increased risk for infection of HCWs resulting from these AGPs. One study in patients with COVID-19 that used CPAP with helmets, and RCTs included in 1 systematic review, suggested that helmets are at least as efficacious as masks in NIV (25, 54, 85), and they have been used in children (86). Very limited evidence suggests that helmets may reduce the risk for transmission. Two additional comprehensive searches identified evidence that suggests a risk for infection for HCWs with COVID-19, SARS, and MERS (2). Tables 1 and 2 provide GRADE evidence profiles for 2 key comparisons (NIV versus IMV and NIV versus no mechanical ventilation), synthesizing the evidence and rating the certainty across the different streams for the most direct evidence (COVID-19, SARS, and MERS). Overall, the certainty of evidence is very low to low based on the observational design, which raise concerns about risk of bias. We did not rate down the evidence from patients with SARS or MERS for indirectness, because these diseases are caused by viruses belonging to the same family and subtype as SARS-CoV-2.\nWe are not aware of systematic reviews on the best NIV strategies in patients with COVID-19 who have acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. The adherence to full systematic review methods, inclusion of all languages, use of the GRADE approach (7), consideration of indirect evidence, and use of different streams of evidence are strengths of our urgent review. We also retrieved a total of 660 guidelines, of which 9 focused on COVID-19 (Table 3) (88\u201396). Of note, HFNC is not recommended by NHS England, although it is recommended by the other guideline bodies. Besides the Australian and New Zealand Guideline bodies and the American Association for Respiratory Care, most guideline bodies recommend CPAP conditionally in selected patients.\nOur study has limitations. The included original studies had poor reporting quality and were mostly observational, with inappropriate control for confounding or selection bias or with only single arms. The sole adjusted study of NIV in patients with COVID-19 was imprecise and included an inappropriately large number of variables in the regression model to produce reliable results. Furthermore, studies had mixed approaches to using NIV. In some, IMV was unavailable, and in others, IMV was used when NIV failed, which can introduce severe selection bias. Although we identified many studies in COVID-19, the most robust studies were in patients with MERS or SARS.\nIn stream 3, the 6 identified mechanistic and laboratory studies of the risk for transmission from AGPs did not allow quantitative risk estimates. In stream 4, we noted, similarly to the CADTH review (2), a risk of bias related to confounding due to use of PPE, which investigators often did not adjust for (74, 79, 97, 98).\nAlthough our data are largely observational (with the exception of 1 small RCT in patients with SARS) and the degree of indirectness still needs to be determined on the basis of new evidence emerging about the similarities of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, prior systematic reviews could not evaluate the effect of NIV on important outcomes in patients infected with coronaviruses. At a minimum, our review serves as a snapshot of the best available evidence. Clinicians should consider using NIV only when appropriate PPE is available to protect HCWs from the infection.\nIt is important that researchers performing observational studies adhere to reporting standards, even during pandemics. What is needed to protect HCWs and prepare for the next pandemic are robust, well-reported studies on strategies to improve the outcomes of patients and protect those who care for them. Although pharmacotherapeutics and vaccines are in the limelight, simple process-of-care measures and common support strategies must be systematically documented and analyzed to adequately prepare for the future. Better studies are needed to inform practice guidelines and reduce inconsistency among their recommendations (ongoing studies are listed in Supplement 14).\nIn conclusion, our systematic review examined different streams of evidence, including original human studies evaluating different modalities of NIV, IMV, and HFNC in COVID-19, SARS, and MERS; systematic reviews in other populations; mechanistic and laboratory evidence; and studies of AGPs. We found low-certainty evidence that NIV may have similar effects as IMV but reduce mortality compared with no IMV in patients with COVID-19 (stream 1). Evidence in other populations with acute hypoxic respiratory failure suggests that NIV improves outcomes compared with conventional oxygen therapy and HFNC (stream 2). However, that evidence is indirect and very limited in children. We searched for but did not identify well-done mechanistic and other laboratory studies that allow quantification of virus transmission risk (stream 3). However, evidence in stream 4 suggests an increased risk for transmission of coronaviruses with invasive procedures, such as intubation and NIV, but also that risk for transmission was difficult to quantify exactly. On the basis of this and other reviews, PPE may reduce for some the risk for transmission during AGPs, but it will not abolish it. The poor quality of conduct and reporting of studies on the effects of NIV on important outcomes in COVID-19 is striking."}]
