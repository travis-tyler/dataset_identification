Enrollment of part-time S&E graduate students declined by 1.8% to 147,034 students, and full-time enrollment grew by 0.8% to 414,384 students in 2012. Full-time students made up 73.8% of the S&E graduate student population. Enrollment of female graduate students decreased in 2012 by 0.1% to 242,548. Although small, this was the first decline in S&E graduate enrollment of women observed in the GSS, which began collecting data on graduate enrollment by sex in 1977. Women made up 43.2% of the S&E graduate enrollment in 2012. Among U.S. citizens and permanent residents, graduate enrollment in S&E declined across all ethnic and racial groups except Hispanics or Latinos and those reporting more than one race. In 2012 S&E graduate enrollment decreased by 2.7% to 31,338 for blacks or African Americans and by 2.1% to 250,783 for whites, the first decline in enrollment for these groups in 10 years. Over the past decade, the distribution of enrollment by race has become more diverse, with whites making up 65.1% of the U.S. citizens and permanent resident graduate students in 2012, compared with 68.1% in 2003. Enrollment of foreign students rose in 2012 by 4.3%.

Some of the year-toyear change may be due to changes in institutional reporting as well as to actual declines in enrollment.

A total of 43,841 S&E postdocs were reported in 2012, a 0.6% decrease from 2011 (table 3). The number of S&E postdocs dropped from 2011 to 2012 among men (-0.5%) and women (-0.9%).

Therefore, the postdoc numbers in 2010 and 2011 are different from the numbers released in previous years. The data in this InfoBrief supersede data in previous reports. In 2012, the number of postdocs in science fields declined by 1.6% (37,335 in 2011 and 36,738 in 2012). The decrease in 2012 is largely due to a decline in the number of postdocs in biological sciences (-4.8%) and physical sciences (-0.8%). The science fields with the largest growth in 2012 were earth, atmospheric, and ocean sciences (10.3%); mathematical sciences (8.7%); and other sciences, which includes the fields of neuroscience and multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary studies (7.3%). A decrease in the number of science postdocs in 2012 was partially offset by an increase in the number of engineering postdocs (4.7%). In 2012, the number of postdocs in engineering climbed to a new high of 7,103, nearly doubling the number since 2003. The two largest increases in the number of engineering postdocs from 2010 to 2012 were in electrical engineering (11.3%) and mechanical engineering (10.8%)."}, {"section_title": "Data Sources and Limitations", "text": "Conducted since 1966, the GSS is an annual survey of all academic institutions in the United States granting research-based master's or doctoral degrees in science, engineering, or selected health (SEH) fields.
