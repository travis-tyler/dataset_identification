[{"section_title": "", "text": "Diets rich in whole-grain foods appear to protect against the development of type 2 diabetes. On January 31, 2011, the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans were released and the recommendations with respect to grains were for individuals to ''Consume at least half of all grains as whole grains'' and ''Increase whole-grain intake by replacing refined grains with whole grains.'' Several prospective observational studies have reported that people with higher intake of whole grains are less likely to develop type 2 diabetes. One potential mechanism whereby whole grains may reduce the risk of developing diabetes is by maintaining insulin sensitivity. The insulin-sensitizing effect of whole grains might be partially due to dietary fiber or magnesium, 2 components of whole grains. In this review, we highlight the recent scientific evidence (ie, since the release of the 2005 Dietary Guidelines) on the role of whole grains on measures of insulin sensitivity. Nutr Today. 2011;46(2):54-65 O ver the past decade, most observational studies have observed that people who consume more whole-grain foods have a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). 1Y6 A recent meta-analysis of these data concluded that a 2-serving-per-day increment in whole-grain consumption reduced diabetes risk by 21%. 6, 7 Since the release of the last (2005) Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) 8 , several studies have attempted to determine whether greater consumption of whole grains improves insulin sensitivity (ie, that peripheral fat and skeletal muscle cells are sensitive to the glucose-lowering effects of the hormone insulin) and other diabetes risk factors. In this review, we highlight some of the more recent scientific evidence (ie, since 2005) relating whole grains to measures of insulin sensitivity.\nWhat Are Whole Grains?\nWhole grains are defined as ''cereal grains that consist of the intact, ground, cracked, or flaked caryopsis (kernel), whose principal anatomical componentsVthe starchy endosperm, germ and branVare present in the same relative proportions as they exist in the intact caryopsis.'' 8 Each component of the grain is nutritionally unique, as shown in Figure. Many different whole grains are available in the US food supply (Table 1) .\nDuring the milling process of grains, the nutritionally superior parts of the grain (bran and germ layer) are discarded, and the carbohydrate-rich endosperm is ground into white flour. As a consequence, the more highly refined the flour, the greater the loss in dietary fiber; the B vitamins thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, and pyridoxine; iron; magnesium; vitamin E; and other measured and unmeasured dietary constituents. 10 Mandatory enrichment and fortification of refined flour with 5 nutrients (thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, folic acid, and iron) ensure that refined grains in the United States are not nutritionally inferior to whole grains with respect to these nutrients. In fact, the levels added back are much higher than naturally occurring levels in many whole grains. Yet, despite enrichment and fortification, diets rich in refined grains do not appear to confer the health benefits observed with whole grains.\nDietary fiber, both water-soluble and insoluble, is not replaced in most refined grain products such as breads, rolls, white rice, and some ready-to-eat breakfast cereals. The water-soluble forms of fiber are found in oatmeal and barley, whereas the insoluble forms are found in whole wheat, located mainly in the outer bran layer. Dietary fiber plays an important role in regulating circulating insulin levels, and therefore consumption of different types of whole-grain foods ensures that different forms of dietary fiber are being consumed by an individual. Furthermore, whole grains deliver myriad micronutrients, antioxidants, and phytochemicals that may independently or synergistically influence glucose and insulin metabolism."}, {"section_title": "Whole-Grain Intake in the United States", "text": "The US Food and Drug Administration defines whole grains as consisting of the intact, ground, cracked, or flaked fruit of the grain whose principal componentsVthe starchy endosperm, germ, and branVare present in the same relative proportions as they exist in the intact grain. 8 A whole grain can be consumed as a ''single food,'' such as oatmeal or brown rice, or alternatively consumed as an ''ingredient'' in a food, such as whole-wheat flour or whole-rye flour in bread and crackers. On January 31, 2011, the 2010 DGA were released with recommendations for individuals to ''Consume at least half of all grains as whole grains'' and ''Increase whole-grain intake by replacing refined grains with whole grains.'' For an adult consuming 2000 daily kilocalories, this translates into consuming at least three ounce-equivalent servings per day of whole grains. In general, a 1-oz equivalent of whole grains contains 16 g of whole grains. Examples of 1-oz servings include 1 slice of bread or 1 cup of ready-to-eat cereal. Half-cup servings of cooked brown rice, cooked whole-wheat pasta, or cooked oatmeal can be considered as 1-oz equivalents from the grains group."}, {"section_title": "9", "text": "In the past, Americans were consuming, on average, only 1 daily serving of whole grains, 11 with the major contributors being hot cereal and cold ready-to-eat breakfast cereals (42%), followed by whole-grain breads (25%), popcorn (12%), and whole-grain crackers (6%). 12 After the release of the 2005 DGA, manufacturers responded by increasing the availability of whole-grain products and foods in the marketplace. For example, manufacturers of refined-grain breakfast cereals have changed their formulas to include whole grains, whereas others have include 100% whole grains in their frozen entrees or have made the vast majority of their breads whole grain. In addition to new products being available in the marketplace, consumers are more educated about what a whole-grain food is, how to identify a whole-grain product, and the purported health benefits of whole grains. 13 At the population level, wheat is the most common grain consumed in the US, constituting 66% to 75% of the total grain intake.\n14 However, actual levels of specific types of whole-grain consumption by individuals have yet to be elucidated. 15, 16 Both studies observed that adults who consumed 3 or more servings of whole grains per day had significantly lower fasting insulin concentrations compared with those who rarely consumed whole-grain foods. Since then, 6 additional cross-sectional studies 17Y22 have provided support for this association using various surrogate measures of insulin sensitivity (Table 2 ).\nIn the previously mentioned studies, 17Y22 food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) were the dietary method of choice, with the exception of 1 study that estimated whole-grain intake based on a 7-day diet record. 18 In adults, the highest consumers of whole grains reportedly consumed, on average, approximately 3 or more daily servings of whole grains, whereas the lowest consumers ate less than one-half of a daily serving of whole grains. In adolescents, reported intake ranged from one-half to one-and-one-half daily servings of whole grains. 21 Fasting insulin is the most cost-effective method of determining insulin resistance; higher levels reflect hepatic insulin resistance and compensatory hyperinsulinemia. Most of the cross-sectional studies that considered fasting insulin as a marker of insulin resistance reported that individuals who ate more whole grains had lower fasting insulin concentrations. 17,19Y22 However, in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, 18 higher intake of whole grains was not associated with fasting insulin concentrations. This may be attributed in part to the smaller sample size (n = 460), the larger age range (27Y88 years), or the use of a single 7-day food record to capture dietary intake. In those studies that observed a significant relationship between whole-grain intake and insulin sensitivity, the observed associations were weakened after adjustment for either overall or central obesity 22 or after accounting for other dietary factors. 19 This attenuation of the relationship between whole-grain intake and insulin suggests that the degree of obesity may be a mediating risk factor or a confounding factor and that other components of the diet that tend to be eaten more frequently by high whole-grain consumers, such as higher intake of fruits and vegetables, may also confound the relationship between whole grains and insulin resistance.\nHomeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR), another surrogate marker of insulin sensitivity, takes into account a person's underlying glycemia status as well as his/her circulating insulin concentration. A higher HOMA-IR is indicative of a greater degree of insulin resistance. In the Multi-ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, 17 after adjustment for demographic and health behavior variables, the HOMA-IR differences between extreme intake categories of whole grains were approximately 8%. This study did not consider the overall degree of obesity in this population, and thus, the true differences in HOMA-IR between extreme categories of intake may, in fact, have been smaller. In the Framingham Offspring Study, 20 a cohort of healthy middle-aged and older adults, a smaller, but significant, difference (approximately 3%) was observed in HOMA-IR between the highest and the lowest consumers of whole grains after controlling for body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference, suggestive of a potential independent effect of whole grains on insulin resistance.\nIn the Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Study, 22 a study of middle-aged adults with normal (67%) and impaired (33%) glucose tolerance, estimates of whole-grain intake derived from FFQs were related to both direct and surrogate measures of insulin sensitivity. The frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (FSIVGTT) with minimal model analysis is a direct measure of insulin sensitivity, with higher values indicating greater insulin sensitivity. In this study, higher whole-grain intake was associated with significantly higher insulin sensitivity after adjustment for BMI and waist circumference. With respect to fasting insulin, higher intake of whole grains was associated with lower insulin concentrations; however, consistent with other studies, inclusion of BMI and waist circumference attenuated the association. Nonetheless, the authors estimated that an increase of 1 serving of whole grains, from 0.8 to 1.8 per day, would be associated with a 13.5% greater insulin sensitivity and a 6.3% lower fasting insulin concentration.\nOnly 1 study 21 conducted in a small sample of adolescents used the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic glucose clamp to quantify insulin sensitivity. This method is considered the criterion standard for insulin sensitivity as it measures the effects of insulin in Consumers should continue to eat a variety of whole grains daily.\npromoting glucose utilization under steady-state conditions. After adjustment for age, sex, race, Tanner stage, energy intake, BMI, and physical activity, a significant positive dose-response association was observed with whole-grain intake, particularly for the heaviest adolescents (BMI Q27.5 kg/m 2 ). A similar observation was found in a larger study of adults: a higher intake of whole grains was also associated with better insulin sensitivity (based on fasting insulin) in obese individuals, whereas no relationship was observed in nonobese. 16 Such findings imply that the most significant impact of whole grains may be among those who are on the trajectory toward developing T2DM.\nAll of the aforementioned studies of whole grains and insulin metabolism were based on servings of whole-grain foods or food deemed to be whole grain based on added bran and germ. More recently, investigators implemented more quantitative estimates of whole-grain intake, based on grams of whole grains in individual foods. 19 Quantifying whole grains in this manner captures the actual amount of whole grains in individual servings of foods, allowing for a more accurate assessment of whole-grain intake and estimates of the bran and germ. This quantitative estimate of whole-grain intake allows for the examination of the potential effects of the components of whole grains (ie, the bran and germ intake) on markers of insulin metabolism.\nUsing this more quantitative estimate of whole grains, Jensen and colleagues 19 examined the cross-sectional association between whole-grain intake and several markers of glycemic control. In this study, whole-grain intake was inversely associated with C-peptide concentrations, a surrogate marker reflecting the amount of insulin that is being made by the pancreas. Individuals with the highest intake of whole-grain foods had C-peptide concentrations that were approximately 17% lower compared with those with the lowest intake of whole grains. Adjustment for dietary factors (ie, fruit, vegetable, sucrose, and fructose intake) only slightly attenuated these associations, suggesting that better measurement of whole-grain consumption may have resulted in less attenuation of the association upon adjustment. In the same study, an inverse association was observed between whole-grain intake and fasting insulin, although this finding was no longer significant after the inclusion of other dietary factors. The authors also considered the relations of the bran and germ on markers of risk of insulin resistance and found that only bran intake showed a moderate inverse association with C-peptide concentrations (P trend = .05). The observed association with bran suggests that fiber and magnesium, both concentrated in the outer bran layer of the germ, may be mediators of the association between whole grains and insulin sensitivity.\nThe main shortfall of the studies summarized above lies within their cross-sectional design. Cross-sectional studies, reflecting snapshots in time, do little to illuminate the event sequence between exposures and outcomes. As a consequence, causality cannot be inferred; we cannot conclude based on these studies that higher intakes of whole-grain foods improve insulin sensitivity. In addition, the fixed food categories on FFQs may limit our ability to adequately capture a person's intake of whole-grain foods, thereby resulting in an underestimation of intake. This misclassification could mask variability among individuals, resulting in attenuated effect estimates for the association between whole grains and surrogate measures of insulin resistance. Limitations of the cross-sectional design can be overcome in prospective observational studies in which whole-grain intake is related to changes in markers of insulin resistance or sensitivity, but to date, no prospective observational study on this relationship has been published. Despite the limitations of data from existing observational studies, the findings from these studies have led scientists to generate and test hypotheses that higher intakes of whole grains improve insulin sensitivity in intervention studies."}, {"section_title": "Evidence From Intervention Studies", "text": "The first randomized, controlled, metabolic study to test the hypothesis that whole-grain consumption improved insulin sensitivity was conducted in 11 overweight, hyperinsulinemic adults. Insulin sensitivity, determined by the euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp test, improved after 6 weeks on a high whole-grain diet compared with a refined-grain diet. 23 The authors also observed a 10% decrease in fasting insulin concentrations following 6 weeks on the whole-grain intervention period. Since then, 3 additional randomized dietary intervention studies 24Y26 have been published, testing the A shortfall of cross-sectional studies is that they reflect snapshots in time and thus do not illuminate the event sequence between exposures and outcomes. hypothesis that whole-grain consumption improves insulin sensitivity. However, none of these studies support a strong association between whole-grain consumption and increased insulin sensitivity (Table 3) . One intervention study, 24 which was designed to compare the effects of whole wheat vs whole oat cereal consumption, showed no effect of either whole-grain cereal on insulin sensitivity over the course of 12 weeks. Insulin sensitivity in this study was determined by an intravenous glucose tolerance test, a more direct measure of insulin sensitivity. This study included middle-aged older adults with elevated blood pressure, and although overweight, participants were considered healthy. It is possible that modification of diet with whole grains in healthy adults alters insulin sensitivity only over much longer periods. In a randomized crossover study, overweight adults were given either whole-grain or refined-grain products to include in their habitual daily diet for two 6-week periods. 26 No changes in insulin sensitivity were observed in this healthy population, in contrast to the findings of the similarly designed study in hyperinsulinemic adults noted above. 23 The incorporation of whole grains in diets of those with more pronounced metabolic abnormalities, as observed in obese or hyperinsulinemic individuals, may exert a stronger effect than in those who are healthy. A randomized crossover trial in postmenopausal women 25 examined the effects of a high-fiber rye bread compared with a low-fiber white wheat bread on measures of glucose and insulin metabolism, as assessed by a FSIVGTT. In this study, no significant changes in insulin sensitivity or glucose were observed over the 8-week intervention; however, the acute insulin response increased significantly with the rye-fiber breadVperhaps indicative of improved insulin secretion by the pancreatic $ cells. More recently, findings from a large intervention study designed to examine the effect of supplemental whole-grain foods on several CVD risk factors in 316 overweight adults found no significant improvements in insulin sensitivity. 28 It is possible that adding whole-grain foods while failing to compensate by omitting other foods may have affected the findings of this study, as discussed elsewhere. 29 The reasons for the different findings among these interventions and between the observational and intervention studies are complex and varied. Components of whole-grain foods vary between the intervention foods and may have a differential impact on glucose and insulin metabolism. Thus, the interpretation of these intervention studies may be complicated by the variations in the dietary interventions themselves. For instance, the form of the food and the botanical structure have been found to modify postprandial glucose and insulin response in healthy adults. 30 Probably more Abbreviations: AA, African American; BMI, body mass index; DAM, dietary assessment method; DGA, 2005 Dietary Guidelines for Americans; DR, diet record; F, female; FFQ, food frequency questionnaire; FSIVGTT, frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test; H, Hispanic; HOMA-IR, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance; IS, insulin sensitivity; M, male; NHW, non-Hispanic white; PUFA, polyunsaturated fatty acid; Q1, lowest quintile category of whole-grain intake; Q5, highest quintile category of whole-grain intake; SFA, saturated fatty acid; T1, lowest tertile category of whole-grain intake; T2, middle tertile category of whole-grain intake; T3, highest tertile category of whole-grain intake; W, white.\nimportant are the varied study populations (eg, obese, nondiabetic subjects, hyperinsulinemic subjects, age range) and the relatively short-term nature of most of these interventions."}, {"section_title": "Role of Dietary Fiber and Other Mediating Nutrients of Whole Grains", "text": "''The whole is greater than the sum of its parts'' is an aphorism that appears to be particularly apropos for the potential health benefits of whole grains. By including whole grains in their diets, consumers automatically take in higher amounts of dietary fiber (varying degrees of soluble and insoluble fiber, depending on the whole-grain source), magnesium, vitamins B 6 and E, and other unmeasured nutrients and nonnutrients. In addition, there is great variability among the various whole grains with respect to phytochemicals such as phenolic compounds, lignan, and sterols, and there remains a great deal of inquiry into the potential mediating nutrients that may be eliciting the observed beneficial effects. 31 Magnesium is an essential cofactor for enzymes involved in glucose and insulin metabolism. In clinical studies, magnesium supplementation improved insulin action among normal patients and patients with T2DM. 32, 33 Magnesium is an integral micronutrient found primarily in the outer bran layer of whole grains and so may contribute to the improved insulin sensitivity observed in some studies. Indeed, the relationship between whole-grain intake and fasting insulin concentrations was no longer statistically significant after adjustment for magnesium and dietary fiber in at least one observational study, 22 suggesting perhaps that the apparent insulin-sensitizing effect of whole grains might be partially mediated by this nutrient.\nDietary fiber, in particular soluble fiber, can blunt the postprandial rise in blood glucose by delaying gastric emptying and macronutrient absorption from the gut. 34 Alternatively, colonic fermentation of nondigestible carbohydrates may increase peripheral insulin sensitivity, 35, 36 perhaps due to the increased production of short-chain fatty acids during the fermentation process in the colon. 37 Other attributes of whole-grain foodsVsuch as particle size, type of Observational studies have linked higher whole-grain intake with better insulin sensitivity, but the evidence from dietary intervention studies has yielded mixed results. \" coefficient = .043, P = .03 Model 3:\n\" coefficient = .041, P = .11 This study compared whole wheat vs oat consumption (data results reflect the change from baseline).\ngrain (eg, rye compared with wheat), ratio of bran or germ to endosperm, or presence of insoluble dietary fiberVmay also be responsible for eliciting the favorable glycemic response. More research is needed on the impact of structural properties and the type of grain on insulin response. When compared with consumption of refined-grain foods, consumption of whole grains may exert different physiological effects, resulting in lower insulinemic and glycemic responses. This may be, in part, due to the foods structure, the glycemic index, or the dietary fiber content of the whole-grain food. 30, 34, 38 In 1 study, 27, 39 whole-meal rye bread and rye bread baked with whole kernels produce a lower insulin response compared with a refined wheat bread, yet no differences were observed in glucose responses. These findings suggest that less insulin is required for the regulation of postprandial glucose excursions after the consumption of whole-grain rye breads. The early (acute) postprandial response of glucose after a meal is offset by the pancreatic $-cell release of insulin, the stimulation of gut hormones (glucagon-like peptide 1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide), and the inhibition of the glucagon release from the pancreatic \" cells. Over the long term as a consequence of the elevated demand for insulin, higher intakes of refined grains may lead to pancreatic exhaustion. Once the pancreas is no longer able to secrete sufficient insulin to compensate for higher glucose levels, mild hyperglycemia and impaired glucose tolerance arise. Coupled with this physiological change, there is a decrease in insulin clearance by the liver, and the peripheral fat and skeletal muscle cells become insensitive to the glucose-lowering effects of insulin, and insulin resistance arises. 40 Given that there are several potential mediating attributes of whole grains that could play a critical role in glucose and insulin metabolism, it is difficult to separate the independent effects of nutrients from the structural properties of different types of whole grains. Furthermore, the health benefits of whole grains observed with higher whole-grain intake in observational studies may not be due to the whole grains per se, but rather due to ''the company they keep.'' For example, people who eat more whole-grain foods tend to live healthier lifestyles and choose healthier foods."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Is insulin sensitivity improved by consumption of whole-grain foods? Based on the current state of knowledge, the evidence linking higher intake of whole grains to better insulin sensitivity is inconclusive. The 2010 DGA advisory committee also reported that the scientific evidence on the relationship between whole grains and T2DM was limited. An apparent contradiction exists between observational studies on insulin sensitivity and whole-grain intake on the one hand, and short clinical trials on the other. One possibility is that long-term quality of a high whole-grain diet reduces insulin demand and consequently reduces pancreatic $-cell exhaustion, insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, and risk of T2DM. To date, there is a lack of data from prospective studies on the impact of whether high whole-grain intake will slow the progression of insulin resistance over time. Fortunately, although understanding the science behind the benefits of whole grains on insulin sensitivity is important, their public health benefit exists largely independent of that knowledge. The 2010 DGA committee concluded there was moderate evidence that intake of whole grains and grain fiber was associated with lower body weight and that whole-grain intake, which includes cereal fiber, protects against cardiovascular disease (http://www.nutritionevidencelibrary.com/ conclusion.cfm?conclusion_statement_id=250211& highlight=whole%20grain&home=1). Several studies have observed that higher intake of whole grains is associated with lower weight and less weight gain, 41 and 1 recent study found that older adults consuming approximately 3 daily servings of whole grains had significantly lower abdominal fat. 42 Dietary fiber is a key mediator of the health benefits of whole grains, but it would be remiss to not consider the myriad micronutrients, antioxidants, phenolic compounds, and unmeasured compounds in whole grains that positively impact metabolic risk factors. Health professionals should continue to promote including a variety of whole-grain foods as a part of an overall healthy lifestyle, with the goal of increasing intake of whole grains to at least 3 servings per day and whenever possible, emphasizing the need to replace refined grains with whole grains."}]
