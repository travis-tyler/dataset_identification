[{"section_title": "", "text": "How is Canada doing in the field of AD? The Canadian Study on Health and Aging 8 gave us a good head start, with incidence and prevalence figures across the country for the late 1980s against which we will compare later this decade. When cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) first became available, family doctors were allowed to prescribe these medications and they are following evidence-based guidelines for diagnosis and treatment common to all interested physicians, the latest revision being done in 2006 9 and the next one scheduled for 2012. A network of specialized memory clinics was created in the early 1990s to facilitate randomized clinical trials for AD in Canada: the Consortium of Canadian Centres for Clinical Cognitive Research (commonly referred to as C5R). This network is 1 of 5, worldwide, currently planning for global prevention studies. 10 More recently, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research initiated the International Collaborative Research Strategy for Alzheimer's Disease (commonly referred to as ICRSAD), including partnership with the United States in the Alzheimer Disease Neuro-Imaging (commonly referred to as ADNI) program, with Germany, the United Kingdom, and other European countries in biomarkers and other technical platforms, and with China for 5-year studies. The Alzheimer Society of Canada has been a strong supporter of AD research in Canada, particularly in training young people from different disciplines.\nThe less positive side of treatment of AD in Canada has been the difficulty in obtaining reimbursement for AD medications across the country. The rivastigmine patch is reimbursed only in 1 province, despite the evidence for better tolerability than the oral formulation, which allows 10 mg (current maximal dose), compared with 15 mg dosing, in a randomized study about to be concluded. Memantine is reimbursed in only 2 provinces, despite the evidence for benefit on agitation and speech impairment, and even in that 1 province memantine is reimbursed only as monotherapy; for example, not with a ChEI, despite growing evidence for the value of combining the 2 drug classes. 11, 12 In the United States and France, these 2 classes of drugs are routinely combined in the moderate stage of AD.\nThere are even greater challenges ahead: if and when treatments become available to significantly slow down disease progression, how will we convince payers to reimburse them? We need to do a better job of finding responders to treatment during phases II and III of drug development: age at onset of symptoms and severity of symptoms may modify which drug to use, apoE genotype and possibly other genes-the pharmacogenomics of AD. 13 W La Revue canadienne de psychiatrie, vol 56, no 10, octobre 2011"}, {"section_title": "Guest Editorial", "text": "Clear start and stopping rules will have to be established. It is conceivable that reimbursement will be conditional on positive biomarkers, such as amyloid deposition measured by positron emission tomography scanning or abnormal beta-amyloid and tau protein levels in cerebrospinal fluid. The upside of these challenges is that the long-term treatment of AD (with the hope of starting as early as mild memory complaints) will become more structured, akin to chemotherapy in certain types of cancers. The downside will be the medicalization of age-related memory decline, which does not progress to dementia in everyone.\nWill prevention of AD become a health care opportunity, akin to reducing heart disease and stroke using relatively simple mid-life changes in lifestyle? This is too early to tell, but expect large-scale primary and secondary prevention trials in the near future aiming at delaying appearance of AD-associated cognitive decline, loss of autonomy, and emergence of neuropsychiatric symptoms."}]
