[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Several common genetic variants influence cholesterol levels, which play a key role in overall health. Myelin synthesis and maintenance are highly sensitive to cholesterol concentrations, and abnormal cholesterol levels increase the risk for various brain diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. We report significant associations between higher serum cholesterol (CHOL) and high-density lipoprotein levels and higher fractional anisotropy in 403 young adults (23.8 AE 2.4 years) scanned with diffusion imaging and anatomic magnetic resonance imaging at 4 Tesla. By fitting a multi-locus genetic model within white matter areas associated with CHOL, we found that a set of 18 cholesterol-related, single-nucleotide polymorphisms implicated in Alzheimer's disease risk predicted fractional anisotropy. We focused on the single-nucleotide polymorphism with the largest individual effects, CETP (rs5882), and found that increased G-allele dosage was associated with higher fractional anisotropy and lower radial and mean diffusivities in voxel-wise analyses of the whole brain. A follow-up analysis detected white matter associations with rs5882 in the opposite direction in 78 older individuals (74.3 AE 7.3 years). Cholesterol levels may influence white matter integrity, and cholesterol-related genes may exert age-dependent effects on the brain."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Nearly a quarter of the body's cholesterol lies in the central nervous system (CNS) (Dietschy and Turley, 2004) , where it serves as the rate-limiting factor for myelin biosynthesis (Saher et al., 2005) . The available pool of cholesterol in the brain also governs CNS synaptogenesis (Mauch et al., 2001) . Thus, cholesterol is essential for brain maturation and white matter (WM) development, and decreased cholesterol early in life may limit both the number and efficacy of synapses. CNS cholesterol concentration is largely independent of serum cholesterol levels because of the low permeability of cholesterol through the blood brain barrier (Saher and Simons, 2010) . Even so, changes in serum concentrations have been associated with variations in the healthy brain's WM structure (Cohen et al., 2011; Williams et al., 2013) .\nThe WM fiber structure of the living human brain can be assessed noninvasively using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). DTI has been used to both characterize patterns of the developing brain (H\u00fcppi and Dubois, 2006; Tamnes et al., 2010) and to demonstrate differences between healthy and unhealthy brains in many disease processes (Le Bihan et al., 2001; Nir et al., 2013) . Regional differences in DTI-derived WM metrics are highly heritable Jin et al., 2011; Thomason and Thompson, 2011) and are associated with differences in a variety of factors including serum biomarker measures and cognitive performance (Chiang et al., 2009; Grieve et al., 2007; Kochunov et al., 2010) .\nVariations in plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels are also highly heritable, and differences even within the healthy range of cholesterol values may exert influence over the brain. A range of 40%e60% of the normal variation in total cholesterol (CHOL), highdensity lipoprotein (HDL), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) concentrations are attributable to genetic influences (Asselbergs et al., 2012) , and several genetic variants have been identified that are associated with lipoprotein levels (Asselbergs et al., 2013) . Cholesterol levels may have age-dependent effects on cognition, suggesting a changing need for cholesterol in the brain over the life span. Multiple studies suggest that higher cholesterol levels in younger adults may be associated with higher fluid intelligence (speed and/or flexibility of mental processing) (Waldstein and Elias, 2001) . Specifically, university undergraduate students with higher serum cholesterol levels showed faster decision-making and movement times on a choice reaction time test (Benton, 1995) , and non-elderly adults with higher cholesterol levels performed better on the WAIS-R Block Design test, which requires rapid, adaptive problem solving skills (Waldstein and Elias, 2001) . Although some studies similarly correlate lower cholesterol with poorer executive function in older adults (Elias et al., 2005; Manolio et al., 1993) , late-life hypercholesterolemia has been strongly associated with an increased risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) (Refolo et al., 2000; Shobab et al., 2005) , a neurodegenerative disease characterized by cognitive deficit (Derouesn\u00e9 et al., 1999) . In general, faster processing and motor speeds have been associated with higher fractional anisotropy (FA) (Aukema et al., 2009; Chiang et al., 2009) , and poorer cognitive performance in executive tasks has been associated with lower FA (Grieve et al., 2007) . As cognition has been associated with cholesterol levels as well as differences in WM, we hypothesize that cholesterol concentration also predicts white matter microstructure.\nCurrently, the role of the serum cholesterol and cholesterol gene variants on brain development and risk for disease are not well understood. As WM continues to mature beyond age 30 (Bartzokis et al., 2004; Kochunov et al., 2010; Tamnes et al., 2010) , we set out to determine whether serum cholesterol concentrations measured during adolescence (mean age: 15 years) might predict WM integrity almost a decade later in early adulthood (mean age: 24 years) in a large cohort of 403 healthy individuals. We further hypothesized that genetic risk factors for high cholesterol, particularly those with known neurologic associations, might relate to WM microstructure -estimated using FA and mean, radial, and axial diffusivities -and that these same specific genetic variants would be associated with axonal integrity in an independent sample of elderly adults. Our goal was to determine if serum cholesterol levels and common cholesterol-related genetic variants were associated with WM microstructural integrity, and, further, if the relationship differed in younger and older age groups."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "We examined 2 different cohortsethe Queensland Twin IMaging cohort (QTIM) of young Australian twins and elderly individuals scanned across North America as part of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI).

The participants' mean age at the time of the cholesterol measurements was 15.2 years (SD 2.3). The lipid panel directly measured CHOL, HDL, and triglyceride levels; LDL was indirectly calculated (and will thus be referred to as LDL-c) from the Friedewald equation (Warnick et al., 1990) :\n(1)\nMeasuring lipid levels in the fasting state is typical, but some studies argue that this may be detrimental to accurate risk assessment based on the lipid profile (Langsted et al., 2008; Mora et al., 2008) . Proponents of fasting lipid measurements often cite the increase in triglyceride levels during a fat tolerance test as a source of error (Schaefer et al., 2001) . In a study of 33,391 individuals, Langsted et al. (2008) reported that non-fasting levels of lipids, lipoproteins, and apolipoproteins vary only minimally from levels in the fasting state. Furthermore, multiple averaged nonfasting measures may better reflect the body's typical lipid profile, as more time is spent in the post-absorptive state than the \"fasting\" state. In the same study, non-fasting LDL-c differed only slightly from fasting measures, but was more useful for predicting risk of cardiovascular events.

We eliminated SNPs with a minor allele frequency <0.22 or a linkage disequilibrium >0.4 to assure that the homozygous minor allele carriers always represented at least 5% of our population and that associations found were independent of variations in other SNPs included in the model. All SNPs passing the initial inclusion criteria (genotyped with passing minor allele frequencies and linkage disequilibriums) were included in keyword searches using Google Scholar to search for prior reports of associations with AD. Of these, 18 SNPs had been associated with AD and were included as SNPs of interest in our study (Astarita et al., 2010; Baum et al., 1999; Dzamko et al., 2011; Gustafsen et al., 2013; Ikeda and Yamada, 2010; Kysenius et al., 2012; Lamsa et al., 2008; Mulder et al., 2012; Natunen et al., 2012; Page et al., 2012; Rodriguez-Rodriguez et al., 2009; Roses et al., 2010; Solfrizzi et al., 2002; Vuletic et al., 2003; Wollmer et al., 2003; Xiao et al., 2012) . The SNPs we included are summarized in Table 1 .\nThese 18 cholesterol-Alzheimer's disease risk SNPs were then entered into a multi-locus analysis to examine whether they had a collective effect in predicting white matter microstructural integrity.

We mapped the voxelwise effects of averaged adolescent blood serum cholesterol measures (CHOL, HDL, and LDL-c; average collection age \u00bc 15.2 years) across the thresholded WM regions of the whole brain to determine associations with white matter integrity. Higher CHOL was associated (after multiple comparisons correction as described in the Methods) with higher FA across broad regions of white matter, including the genu of the corpus callosum (G), corpus callosum overall (CC), fornix (FX), internal capsule (IC), and the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF) (Fig. 2) .

Higher HDL was associated with lower D rad ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ), but variation in HDL was not significantly associated with D ax and D mean .

This analysis was carried out within the voxels associated with CHOL in the previous analysis. Arguably, the effects of cholesterol-related SNPs on the brain may be more likely to be detected at locations where serum cholesterol associations have already been detected. Such a relationship was found in a voxel-wise FA analysis of serum iron transport protein levels and related genes . A restricted search space imposes a less stringent significance threshold to report credible associations. Otherwise a heavy multiple comparisons correction is required to adjust for searching the whole brain.\nEach SNP was coded additively as 0, 1, or 2 according to the number of minor alleles present in each subject. The significance levels (p-value) of individual and joint SNP associations with FA, D rad , D mean , and D ax (radial, mean, and axial diffusivity; respectively) were determined from the F-score of the partial F-test:\nHere, RSS represents the residual sum-of-squares (number of subjects, n). Our reduced model included only covariates (age, sex) as parameters (Pcovariates), and the full model contained all SNPs and covariates (Pfull). p-maps were generated for each individual SNP, covarying for each of the 17 other SNPs.\nAs adolescent CHOL levels were associated with WM structure in adulthood, we further examined common variants in a subset of cholesterol-related genes previously associated with AD risk (Table 1) . Using a multi-SNP genetic model , we examined the joint effect of allele dosage of 18 SNPs on brain regions where CHOL was associated with FA. This avoided correction across unnecessary tests at potentially unrelated voxels or voxels with poor signal-to-noise ratio and boosted detection sensitivity by limiting the search space.\nThe multi-SNP analysis shows the proportion of variance (R 2 ) in FA explained by our SNP panel. Significant predictions of FA were made by the joint multi-SNP model (p-value \u00bc 1.09 \u00c2 10 \u00c05 , critical p-value of 0.023 in 46.7% of voxels of the CHOL FA mask in the IC, CC, and the IFOF and/or ILF (Fig. 3) . The critical p-value is the highest threshold that controls the FDR, and higher critical p-values (closer to 0.05) denote stronger effects. We generated p-maps for the individual associations with FA for each SNP, simultaneously covarying for the effects of the other SNPs. rs5882 of CETP individually survived multiple comparisons correction across all voxels using FDR at q \u00bc 0.05 individually (minimum voxelwise p-value \u00bc 6.54 \u00c2 10 \u00c07 , critical p-value \u00bc 0.033). For the main multi-SNP analysis, only 1 statistical test is completed so no further correction is necessary for the number of SNPs in the analysis. For the individual SNP analyses, however, we corrected for both the number of voxels tested and the number of SNPs tested. Even so, rs5882 in CETP was statistically significant at the new more stringent significance threshold (p-value \u00bc 7.61 \u00c2 10 \u00c07 )."}, {"section_title": "Candidate gene analysis", "text": "As a post hoc test, we assessed the effect of the one SNP that contributed most to the multi-SNP results, examining its individual voxelwise associations with measures of microstructural WM integrity on the thresholded whole brain scans of QTIM participants.

FA will therefore be high (nearer to 1) in regions of high organization (e.g., the corpus callosum), intermediate in regions with some organization (i.e., white matter regions with no predominant fiber orientation), low in regions that are not specifically oriented (i.e., gray matter), and near zero in free fluids (i.e., cerebrospinal fluid) (Grieve et al., 2007) .\nLower FA can also indicate a reduction in the density of WM fibers, a loss in axonal bundle coherence, or a variation in membrane permeability to water (Beaulieu and Allen, 1994) , so radial, mean, and axial diffusivity (D rad , D mean , D ax ) are also commonly included in WM assessments (Barysheva et al., 2013) . D ax (l 1 ) represents the tendency of water to diffuse along its primary direction of diffusion.\nD rad (the average of l 2 and l 3 ) measures diffusion perpendicular to the axonal fibers. D rad is thought to be minimally affected by the loss of bundle coherence and often increases when myelin is damaged or fails to develop normally (Song et al., 2002 (Song et al., , 2005 Thomason and Thompson, 2011) . D mean ( b l) is the average of the diffusivities in the 3 principal diffusion directions. Thus, D mean provides an overall evaluation of the molecular motion in a voxel or region, characterizing the overall presence of obstacles to diffusion (Thomason and Thompson, 2011) .

We found significant associations between elevated total adolescent cholesterol (CHOL) and HDL levels and higher FA measured from DTI images acquired during early adulthood (QTIM). Ensuing analyses with other diffusivity measures suggested that higher cholesterol levels are indeed associated with greater WM integrity. We also found that cholesterol genes were associated with FA in these young adults in regions with substantial overlap to serum cholesterol measures. One SNP, rs5882 of CETP, independently held significant associations with DTI metrics, showing differential effects in younger (QTIM) and older populations (ADNI).\nChanges in magnetic resonance imaging signal, as detected by fractional anisotropy, can be attributed to a number of physiological factors including edema, demyelination, and inflammation (Assaf and Pasternak, 2008; Thomason and Thompson, 2011) . The different processes contributing to significant signal change can potentially be distinguished by investigating the different diffusivity maps generated in DTI studies (Assaf and Pasternak, 2008) . We performed our analyses with multiple DTI-derived measures (fractional anisotropy and axial, radial, and mean diffusivities) to provide a clearer picture of the white matter microstructural differences identified. Some of these metrics have been studied in post-mortem analyses and animal model studies, and Drad has potentially shown specificity for assessment of myelination (Song et al., 2005) . For a full explanation of DTI-derived measures, see Section 2.\nIn voxel-based analyses, the presence of gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid within a single voxel lead to partial voluming ). This effect is amplified in scans acquired with larger slice thicknesses or greater voxel size. By limiting our statistical tests to regions where the template showed an FA >0.25 (0.2 for the older cohort), we attempted to limit our analyses to highly probable white matter voxels where partial voluming plays a minimal role. However, because of voxel sizes much larger than axonal bundles, partial voluming remains an inherent limitation in current DTI analyses.\nThe bulk of cholesterol biosynthesis during brain maturation is produced for myelin development (Morell and Jurevics, 1996) and myelination continues well into adulthood. Only recently has imaging been used to examine associations between serum cholesterol levels and brain structure in vivo. To our knowledge, our article is the first to examine such associations in young adults. Elevated CHOL and HDL measured during adolescence were associated with greater FA levels and, more specifically, lower D rad in young adults. Higher cholesterol levels in early life may be associated with more robust myelination and greater progression along the WM developmental trajectory, contributing to greater WM microstructural integrity. Cholesterol analyses were only performed on the QTIM data set.\nSerum cholesterol levels increase nearly linearly from adolescence through mid-life at an annual rate of 2.29 mg/dL (0.06 mmol/ L) (Keys et al., 1950) . As all QTIM participants were healthy, little deviation from this trend is expected. Because of the linear relationship, durations between serum collection (average age 15.2 AE 2.3 years) and scan time will be almost exclusively correlated with age at the time of the scan (average age 23.8 AE 2.0 years) and therefore are not modeled separately. Although statistically significant associations between CHOL/ HDL and FA were detected in broad WM regions in the young adults, cholesterol may simply have a more generalized effect on WM throughout the brain. Associations between cholesterol levels and FA are conventionally shown for regions where the estimated effect size for a set of voxels exceeds that expected by chance (searchlight FDR thresholded at q \u00bc 0.05). Thus, any inference about where the association is detected does not imply that the effects are not present elsewhere in the brain (Jernigan et al., 2003) . Lack of standardization in the brain's arterial supply (Tatu et al., 1996) , differences in age of maturation of different white matter regions (Tamnes et al., 2010) , and other anatomic variability may, in part, contribute to the detectability of a statistical association in any brain region.\nCholesterol concentration is influenced by genetics, so we performed a voxelwise joint multi-SNP analysis on brain regions significantly associated with CHOL in the young adults. Several AD risk genes overlap with those that may increase a person's risk for high serum cholesterol (Arias-Vasquez et al., 2007; Rodriguez-Rodriguez et al., 2009; Solfrizzi et al., 2002; Wollmer et al., 2003) . AD pathology is marked by a global cognitive decline (Moseley, 2002) and by alterations in various WM structures of the brain (Bartzokis et al., 2003; Bozzali et al., 2002; Brun and Englund, 1986; Rose et al., 2000) , with lower FA observed in AD patients versus healthy controls (Parente et al., 2008; Rose et al., 2008; Takahashi et al., 2002) . DTI metrics have even detected changes in the WM microstructure between healthy elderly individuals and patients with MCI (Bosch et al., 2012; Ukmar et al., 2008) , indicating the usage of mapping the effects of risk-variants before the onset of disease. As thousands of SNPs are implicated in the cholesterol metabolizing pathway, we narrowed our search to a panel of 18 cholesterol related SNPs previously associated with AD risk, which have known neurologic involvement. Significant associations were detected between this set of genes and FA, suggesting that variations in the cholesterol-metabolizing pathway influence WM microstructure. These genes may affect the local concentration of cholesterol available to oligodendrocytes, as CNS myelination is hindered when cholesterol synthesis is impaired in oligodendrocytes (Saher et al., 2005) . Significant associations between white matter microstructure (as measured here by thresholded whole brain voxel-wise FA) and CETP (rs5882) risk (G) allele dosage in (A) the QTIM sample and (B) ADNI. In QTIM (A), increased G-allele dosage was associated with higher FA in statistically significant regions. Yellow corresponds to stronger beta-values (more positive). In ADNI (B), increased G-allele dosage was associated with lower FA in statistically significant regions. Pink corresponds to stronger beta-values (more negative).

(For interpretation of the references to color in this figure, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)\nThe multi-SNP analysis also identified the variant of the cholesterol-related genes with the largest influence on FA, CETP (rs5582). The role of CETP (cholesteryl ester transfer protein) in plasma has been extensively studied (Ruggeri, 2005) , but its role in the brain is less well understood. CETP protein product is detectable in cerebrospinal fluid (Tall, 1993) , suggesting that the gene influences the cholesterol concentration available to the brain. CETP mediates transfer of cholesteryl esters from HDL to LDL and other lipoproteins and promotes subsequent uptake by the cell (Inazu et al., 1990) . CETP rs5882 (I405V) represents an A to G variation, which encodes valine in place of isoleucine. Risk (G) allele homozygotes show significantly lower CETP and higher HDL levels (AriasVasquez et al., 2007; Asselbergs et al., 2012) .\nIn young adults, the rs5882 risk-allele dosage, assessed additively, was broadly associated with higher FA: risk (G-allele) homozygotes had higher FA than A-allele homozygotes and heterozygotes. Significantly lower radial diffusivity and mean diffusivity were also observed with increasing risk-allele dosage. Thus, the rs5882 I405V variant may lead to greater myelination and axonal integrity during brain development. As higher cholesterol levels are essential for maturation, abundant or elevated HDL levels may serve a critical role in the development of heavily myelinated white matter fibers. Turley et al. (1996) suggest that LDL cholesterol plays little to no role in the sterol acquiring process of the developing brain, and, in our own analysis, LDL-c failed to show significant associations with DTI correlates of white matter microstructure in young adults.\nAlthough elevated cholesterol levels may support brain development, higher cholesterol later in life may be detrimental to the brain. In addition to increasing risk for degenerative brain disease (Refolo et al., 2000) , hypercholesterolemia also contributes to higher risk for developing cerebrovascular disorders (Kaste and Koivisto, 1988) , including dysfunction of the blood brain barrier (Kalayci et al., 2009) . Prior studies have found negative associations between serum cholesterol measures and FA in older individuals (Cohen et al., 2011; Williams et al., 2013 ) (average age of participants \u00bc 58.3 AE 1.2 and 68.0 AE 9.4 years, respectively). As Cohen et al. (2011) jointly analyzed the effects of \"abnormal cholesterol\" (high HDL, low LDL, and/or statin use), we cannot directly relate our findings to their results. Contrary to results from our younger cohort, Williams et al. (2013) reported that greater HDL was associated with lower FA in an older group. Although serum cholesterol information was not available for all older participants evaluated from ADNI, we found that rs5882 risk-allele dosage (associated with higher HDL, Asselbergs et al., 2012) was associated with lower FA and higher D rad and D mean , suggesting lower WM microstructural integrity. Here, higher D rad may be indicative of lower levels of myelination.\nSome WM regions where FA associations with serum cholesterol levels were detected (genu of the corpus callosum, inferior longitudinal fasciculus) are among the earliest and most rapidly changing WM tracts (Lebel et al., 2008) , suggesting that WM microstructure in these areas may be more susceptible to cholesterol concentration present during the crucial developmental period. Although many different models describe the underlying association between WM and AD (Bartzokis, 2011; Nir et al., 2013) , WM atrophy is often attributed, in part, to Wallerian degeneration and therefore may be secondary to gray matter loss (Bozzali et al., 2002) . Axonal integrity of the splenium of the corpus callosum (SP), among other regions, is lower in AD patients (Chua et al., 2008) . Associations between cholesterol-gene CETP risk-allele dosage and WM were found in the SP of young, healthy adults, suggesting that there may be a genetic component influencing these changes long before the onset of disease or agerelated degeneration. Validation of our findings and proof of differential effects across brain regions would require a more focused study of cholesterol throughout development or a longitudinal assessment of cognitive impairment, which are beyond the scope of this study.\nIn summary, although previous studies have shown associations between serum cholesterol levels and brain structure in older adults, this study may be the first to suggest that higher cholesterol levels are associated with greater white matter microstructural integrity in young adults. Cholesterol-related genetic variants predicted FA in nearly half of these WM regions associated with serum cholesterol. As serum cholesterol is essentially separated from brain cholesterol, these genes may also act in the brain to affect the local cholesterol microenvironment and, as a result, WM integrity. rs5882 risk (G) allele dosage showed opposite directional associations in 2 groups of participants most likely because of age differences between the cohorts, predicting significantly higher WM integrity in young adults and lower WM integrity in old adults. Because this specific variant forms a gene product that promotes elevated HDL, high HDL may be beneficial during WM development and detrimental later in life. Additional studies are needed to provide further evidence that the association is not a false positive.\nThe relationship between cholesterol and the brain is important for understanding the healthy aging process and pathology. When cholesterol available to the brain is reduced during development, white matter maturation is significantly affected. Lower white matter integrity could lead to slower signaling and impaired cognitive function, specifically in tasks requiring rapid decision and movement times (Muldoon et al., 1997) . Late-life hypercholesterolemia, by contrast, is associated with cognitive decline (Elias et al., 2005; Solomon et al., 2009 ) and higher risk for late-onset AD in several studies (Reid et al., 2007; Sparks, 1997) . Optimal cholesterol levels in the brain change over the life span, so some cholesterol-related genetic variations may be beneficial to white matter microstructural integrity early in life and detrimental later. Future longitudinal research is required to further elucidate how the favorable range of cholesterol levels changes throughout life and how these changes affect the brain. Study of the detrimental affects of unfavorable cholesterol levels may help us understand genetic risk decades before disease onset and may even lead to the development of novel therapeutic targets."}, {"section_title": "Disclosure statement", "text": "The authors have no competing financial interests."}]
