Tempe Elementary School District No. 3, 1978; Larry P. v. Riles, 1984) , and professional arenas (e.g., national technical assistance centers, training programs). Donovan and Cross (2002) described disproportionality as a paradox of special education in that identification is meant to allocate necessary and appropriate services and additional resources for students with disabilities, but it may also lead to stigmatization, segregation, exposure to low expectations, receipt of weak curriculum, and constraint of postschool outcomes. Scholars have also questioned the effectiveness of special education, and recent research indicates that services have negligible or negative effects on the learning and behavioral outcomes of elementary students (Morgan, Frisco, Farkas, & Hibel, 2010) . Together, these issues underpin concerns about differential identification and its implications."}, {"section_title": "PAT T E R N S O F DIS P R O P O R T I O N A L I T Y I N SPE C I A L EDUCATIO N", "text": "Findings of racial disproportionality have been consistent for decades, with disproportionate representation commonly observed in the high-incidence categories of disability. Today, Black students are twice as likely to be identified as ED and 2.7 times as likely to be identified as CI than their White peers nationally, whereas Native American students are nearly twice as likely to be identified as SLD and 60% more likely to be identified as CI (U.S. Department of Education, 2010) . Conversely, Latino students tend to be proportionally or slightly underrepresented across disability categories nationally whereas Asian/Pacific Islander students are typically moderately underrepresented (i.e., 20% to 70% less likely to be identified as disabled in the highincidence categories) relative to White students (Donovan & Cross, 2002 ; U.S. Department of Education, 2010) .\nWhereas the national picture of racial disparities in identification is relatively stable, variations over time and locality exist, particularly for students identified as Latino or English learners (ELs), although the research on these population is limited (e.g., Artiles, Harry, Reschly, & Chinn, 2002; Artiles, Rueda, Salazar, & Higareda, 2005; Sullivan, 2011; Valenzuela, Copeland, Qi, & Park, 2006) . Fewer than one in five disproportionality studies examined multiple racial groups-40% of studies focused exclusively on Black students (Waitoller, Artiles, & Cheney, 2010) . Gender disparities have also received limited attention in the literature, although researchers have recognized that males are at heightened risk for ED and SLD (Coutinho & Oswald, 2005) , particularly among Blacks and Native Americans identified as CI and SLD (Coutinho, Oswald, & Best, 2002; Oswald, Coutinho, Best, & Nguyen, 2001) ."}, {"section_title": "FACTO R S REL AT E D T O DISP R O P O R T I O N AT E REPRES E N TAT I O N", "text": "Scholars have acknowledged that disproportionality is a complex, multiply determined problem shaped by a variety of interpersonal, social, environmental, cultural, and institutional forces (Artiles, Kozleski, Trent, Osher, & Ortiz, 2010; Skiba et al., 2008) . Concern that identification is based on factors beyond students' medical, developmental, or cognitive functioning is widespread, reflected in the focus on the high-incidence, or \"subjective,\" disability categories rather than the more physically based disabilities (e.g., Artiles & Trent, 1994; Klingner et al., 2005) . Researchers have investigated many variables as potentially related to racial disparities in identification. Early research examined potential implications of bias in teacher ratings of performance and referral patterns, but results were mixed (Cullinan & Kauffman, 2005; MacMillan, Gresham, & Bocian, 1996) . Studies of assessment bias have also been equivocal, but the consensus appears to be that differential performance is not attributable to measurement bias (Skiba, Knesting, & Bush, 2002) . Others have studied educational processes, including referral and multidisciplinary teaming (e.g., Harry, Klingner, & Hart, 2005; Wilkinson, Ortiz, Robertson, & Kushner, 2006) ; and though scholars have identified shortcomings-particularly frequent disregard for legal disability criteria-researchers have not established links and causal relations to disproportionality.\nMost studies of disproportionality have relied on school-or district-level datasets to explore variables related to group-level risk. Researchers have studied variables like enrollment, racial and linguistic makeup of student body, per-pupil expenditures, student-teacher ratios, teacher credentials, teacher demographics, discipline patterns, mean academic performance, dropout rates, and proportions of students receiving free and reduced-price lunch (e.g., see Coutinho et al., 2002; Eitle, 2002; Hosp & Reschly, 2004; Serwatka, Deering, & Grant, 1995; Skiba, PoloniStaudinger, Simmons, Feggins-Azziz, & Chung, 2005; Sullivan, 2011) . Researchers have also considered the influence of community socioeconomic variables such as median housing value, median income, and mean educational attainment of adults (e.g., Coutinho et al., 2002; Eitle, 2002) . Findings across studies are inconsistent, particularly regarding economic variables, which appear to be differentially related to identification of racial and linguistic minority groups across disability categories. Often, community or school poverty is inversely related to risk, challenging the supposition that minority overrepresentation might result from disadvantage. Because of the nature of the data used in these studies, scholars have not widely explored the relations of individual poverty status to disability risk. This disparity may explain divergent results. Our study seeks to clarify this particular facet of the research by examining the relations of both individual and community socioeconomic factors to disability risk.\nStudies of student-level data are relatively rare within the disproportionality literature. Recently, however, scholars have begun to use largescale datasets to study differential special education risk. For instance, Hibel, Farkas, and Morgan (2010) , though not explicitly concerned with disproportionality, used the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-1999 (ECLS-K) to identify child, family, and school variables measured at kindergarten that predicted special education identification at fifth grade. Hibel and colleagues found that kindergarten academic skills were the strongest predictor of identification, even after controlling for child and school racial demographics, SES, and performance variables. Statistically controlling for academic performance resulted in Black and Latino students being at lower risk than White students for special education identification, and this variable mediated the effects of SES. Students of color were also less likely to be identified for special education in schools with high-minority enrollment than comparable peers in low-minority settings. In addition, school achievement also influenced risk, resulting in what the authors deemed a \"frog-pond\" effect in which lower performing students in high achieving schools were more likely to be identified for special education.\nMore recently, Shifrer, Muller, and Callahan (2011) employed multilevel modeling to predict SLD identification at 10th grade based on a variety of child academic and sociodemographic characteristics using data from the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 (National Center for Education Statistics, 2002). Like Hibel et al. (2010) , these authors found that racial minority students were less likely to be identified as SLD when gender and educational experiences were accounted for. Notably, SES accounted for disproportionality among Black and Latino students, which runs counter to the findings of Hibel and colleagues and earlier studies (Skiba et al., 2008; Sullivan & Artiles, 2011) . The authors called attention to the discrepancies between the multivariate analyses previously described and bivariate analyses like those common in the disproportionality literature which indicated elevated risk for minority students. In light of these differences, the authors emphasized the need for sophisticated analyses when studying the factors related to disproportionality. Nonetheless, like other scholars before them (e.g., Artiles, 1998; Oswald et al., 2001) , both Hibel et al. and Shifrer et al. (2011) posited that disproportionality may result more from social differences than from learning problems because of the influence of nonacademic factors in risk of identification."}, {"section_title": "LIMITATIONS T O T H E EXIS T I N G DISPR O P O R T I O N A L I T Y RESEA R C H", "text": "The study of disproportionality has long been restricted by the availability of data. Often disproportionality scholars have been limited to federal and state databases that allowed only consideration of state-and district-level patterns of identification and were not sensitive to the state or local variations or within group diversity (Waitoller et al., 2010 ). Studies using child-level data are few, and even among those, attention to multiple dimensions of difference concurrently were limited. Most focused solely on race, with the majority studying only Black-White disparities (Waitoller et al., 2010) . Many of the existing analyses were restricted to the study of race, gender, and SES, with language status unavailable because few school systems collected such information for students with disabilities (Zehler et al., 2003) .\nMore fine-grained analyses-those using child data and considering both within-and between-group diversity-are needed to (a) better understand both the typography and roots of this problem, and (b) avoid the ecological fallacy and aggregation bias when making individual-level inferences without individual-level data. Further, analyses rarely account for nesting within school systems. Both of these shortcomings can be attenuated through the application of multilevel modeling to account for the nested nature of students' experiences and allow for examination of how individual-level risk factors may be moderated by school characteristics, a central concern in the disproportionality discourse. Although recent analyses Shifrer et al., 2011) accounted for a variety of child and school factors in multivariate analyses, both dealt with relatively restricted samples with regard to age/grade; and many variables not accounted for in these analyses are related to disproportionality when studied at the school level (e.g., discipline variables as in Skiba et al., 2005) . Further, results of these studies were divergent and contradicted findings from earlier district-level analyses.

More specifically, the aim of this study was to further test the strength of sociodemographic variables and school performance in predicting risk of special education identification.\nThis analysis was guided by two broad research questions:\n1. To what extent are students from diverse cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds disproportionately represented in special education when multiple dimensions of difference are considered simultaneously?\n2. To what extent is individual risk for special education identification predicted by individual and school factors?\nMore specifically, the intent here was to consider not only race, but race in conjunction with other social groupings (i.e., gender, EL status, SES). We selected child-and school-level predictor variables to test the relations previously explored in both the recent multilevel analyses described previously and the more common district-level analyses from the earlier disproportionality literature. Here, we examined predictors of identification in each of the traditional high-incidence disability categories (i.e., SLD, CI, ED), as well as the lesser studied categories of other health impairment (OHI) and speech/language impairment (SLI), which also serve large proportions of students, as well as a general group comprised of the low-incidence disabilities (e.g., autism, hearing impairments, orthopedic impairments, traumatic brain injury) to test whether the relations of the sociodemographic and school variables vary across the different types of disabilities (i.e., high-vs. lowincidence), which has not generally been explored."}, {"section_title": "M E T H O D", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "SAMPL E", "text": "We took the sample from archival data from one diverse urban school district in the Midwest, obtained through an institutional agreement between the authors and the district.

For the purposes of this study, we computed the risk index, an indicator of groups' overall likelihood of special education identification, for each of the demographic groupings to allow for comparison of risk according to the primary dimensions along which differential identification might occur-i.e., race, language status, gender, and SES as operationalized by receipt or nonreceipt of free or reducedprice lunch-as well as the intersections of those latter categories with race. For each demographic grouping, we calculated the risk index by dividing the total number of students identified in a given disability category by the total number of enrolled students for that group. Here, the focus is not on statistical significance of differences in risk because of both the large number of comparisons and because the interest in relative risk. It is relative risk, also a measure of effect size, that is the focus of much of the existing disproportionality literature and state policy analyses (Sullivan, 2011) , thus allowing for comparison across studies and to the odds ratios obtained in the logistic regression described below.\nMultilevel Logistic Regression. This study used multilevel logistic regression to estimate the effects of child and school factors on special education risk. We selected multilevel modeling to account for the clustering of students within schools; this modeling allows for more accurate estimations of within-and between-school effects-that is, the student-level effects within schools, as well as the influences of the school context. We used multivariate hierarchical models to identify which characteristics were predictive of identification after accounting for other characteristics of the students and schools. We conducted these models using HLM7 software. We centered all continuous variables around the grand mean. The dependent variables were dichotomous indicators for special education status and specific disability identification.

When considering univariate risk (i.e., race, gender, poverty, or LEP status), males and those receiving free/reduced-price lunch were at the elevated risk for special education identification and in each of the specific disability categories examined; but racial-minority students demonstrated the greatest risk across categories. For instance, nearly a quarter of Black students were identified for special education and were more than 2.8 times more likely to be identified as SLD or ED, and 2.5 times more likely to be identified as CI than were White students. When we examined the intersections of categories (e.g., race and gender simultaneously), males and students receiving free/reduced-price lunch had the greatest risk across racial groups. Among Black males, nearly one in three were identified for special education, and Black females were nearly twice as likely to be identified as females of other races. The analysis also showed the Black students were more likely than their White peers to be identified as OHI or SLI, but they were underrepresented among students with low-incidence disabilities. Indeed, each of the racial-minority groups examined were underrepresented among the low-incidence categories relative to their White peers. Lower income students, as indicated by free/reduced-price-lunch status, were consistently more likely to be identified for special education than students from higher income backgrounds, with the exception of low-incidence diagnoses.\nLatino students were not generally overrepresented compared to White students, but were 55% more likely to be identified as SLI.

Tables 3 and 4 show the results of the multilevel logistic regression models predicting identification for special education, LD, ED, CI, OHI, SLI and the low-incidence categories.

This finding suggests that students in the low-incidence categories are identified at school entry or early elementary, which is not unexpected given medical or physical basis of many of the diagnoses that contribute to these categories (e.g., hearing impairments, severe cognitive impairments) are apparent early in development and that the average age of autism diagnosis is 3 years (Mandell, Novak, & Zubritsky, 2005) . Later identification of the high-incidence disabilities may be attributable to the subjective nature of diagnoses, dynamics of the referral and evaluation process, or cumulative effects of educational experience on students' academic and behavioral difficulties.\nMales were significantly more likely to be identified across disability categories except CI despite their elevated risk for CI in the descriptive analyses. This gender effect was not attenuated by any of the other child or school factors included in this study and were consistent with earlier disproportionality and disability research (e.g., Hibel et al., 2010; Oswald et al. 2001; Shifrer et al., 2011) . Although such variation may be due to biological factors, evidence of state variations in prevalence suggests that cultural-historical context of local educational systems may also influence gender disproportionality (Coutinho & Oswald, 2005) . Coutinho and Oswald suggested that special education policy and procedures may be applied differently based on gender, yet little research has investigated potential school organizational, institutional, or practices related to differential risk of educational disability between boys and girls.\nBlack students were significantly more likely to be identified for special education and as SLD, whereas Latino and Asian students were significantly underrepresented in special education generally, and SLD, CI (Latinos only) and ED (Asian only). Although these effects were attenuated by SES, race remained a significant predictor of special education status and SLD. This finding contradicted those of Shifrer and colleagues (2011) and Hibel and colleagues (2010) , who found that Black students were underrepresented in special education and as SLD and SLI specifically after accounting for child and school variables. These researchers also found that Latino and Asian students were underrepresented across high-incidence categories. This was basically consistent with the findings here for SLD but not those for the other disabilities examined, which were broader than those in Hibel's study.\nStudents who received free/reduced-price lunch were significantly more likely than their peers who were not likely to be identified for special education and in SLD, ED, and CI. Children whose parents had less than a college education were significantly more likely to be identified for special education and SLD, while those whose parents had advanced degrees were less likely to be identified, unlike Shifrer and colleagues (2011) who did not find significant predictive relations. These findings, however, were consistent with those of Hibel and colleagues (2010) , who showed that high family SES predicted lower risk of disability. Differences from the earlier literature may be attributable to the unit of analysis-that is, community measures in earlier studies versus measures of individual SES in the recent workand the mechanisms by which disproportionality is produced (for discussion, see Sullivan & Artiles, 2011, for example) .\nThe relations of special education identification and discipline outcomes are not often explored in the disproportionality literature, but the present study suggests that the discipline policies and procedures are important to consider when investigating differential disability risk. Students with high numbers of suspensions were at increased risk of identification for special education, and as SLD, ED, or OHI specifically. Earlier research had shown that district rates of suspensions predicted district rates of identification for ED and CI (Skiba et al., 2005) . The present study replicated this finding for individual suspensionsrelated ED, SLD, and OHI risk.\nSchool-level variables were not generally significant predictors of individual risk here, although increases in school size were predictive of small but significant increases in risk of identification as SLD, ED, and OHI. In addition, students were more likely to be identified as ED in schools where a high proportion of the student body received free/reduced-price lunch. Students were also less likely to be identified as CI in schools serving high proportions of students identified as LEP or in schools where rates of retention were high. Where retention was high, students were less likely to be identified for special education and in the specific categories for SLD and CI. It may be that some school systems rely on retention or disciplinary exclusion as means of addressing students' learning and behavioral difficulties whereas others rely on special education. These findings suggest a need to examine the relations of disproportionality to retention and discipline because both are amenable to policy and practice change. School size also appears to affect responses to students' learning and behavioral difficulties. Together, these findings emphasize the need to explore the roles of school structures and everyday practices in shaping such inequities through the structuring of opportunity (Artiles et al., 2012) .\nUnlike Hibel and colleagues' (2010) analysis, neither racial-minority enrollment nor school-level achievement significantly affected student risk of identification here. These results also showed that school-level teacher and student race were not significant predictors, unlike earlier analyses conducted at the district-level only (e.g., Serwatka et al., 1995; Gaviria-Soto & CastroMorera, 2005; Oswald et al., 2001; Oswald, Coutinho, Best, & Singh, 1999) . Nonetheless, the results do indicate that school context influences the likelihood of special education identification, consistent with the conclusion of other researchers who concluded that social difference and context matter in the identification of educational disabilities (e.g., Hibel et al., 2010; Shifrer et al., 2011) ."}, {"section_title": "L I M I TAT I O N S", "text": "It is necessary to acknowledge certain limitations of this research. First, this study relied on data from one school system only, which may limit generalizability because the sample characteristics differ from other locales; and the patterns observed may be attributable to idiosyncratic identification practice. Results may be most applicable to urban Midwestern school systems. Nonetheless, because large-scale data that includes both disabled and nondisabled subsamples are limited, this study is an important addition to an emerging body of literature examining child and school predictors of individual risk of disability. It provides a model for analyzing disproportionality across contexts, and the utility of this study may supersede issues of generalizability with the present findings.\nSecond, the specific variables used to operationalize SES (i.e., parental education and free/reduced-price-lunch status) and school characteristics, may not have adequately captured the constructs of interest. However, given that this study entailed secondary data analysis, we were restricted to the variables available in the district's information systems. Unfortunately, it was impossible to identify the mechanisms by which the observed gender, race, and SES effects operate. More specifically, it is impossible to determine by these analyses alone whether male and Black students are at increased risk of disability because of inherent characteristics or systemic differential treatment within educational settings. Likewise, it was impossible to determine whether the observed SES differences resulted from prenatal, family, or environmental factors that shape cognitive and social development, or, conversely, because students of lower SES experience different opportunities to learn or treatment during disability identification than students of higher SES.\nFinally, patterns and predictors of special education for students who were Native American could not be examined here because of the small size of this subsample. Given that this is one group that is understudied in the special education literature, despite consistent evidence of overrepresentation (Sullivan & Artiles, 2011) , more research is needed in this domain. In addition, a substantial number of students were dropped from the analysis because of insufficient data at the school level."}, {"section_title": "IMPLICATIONS F O R RESE A R C H", "text": "Scholars have long expressed concern that the study of disproportionality obscured patterns of disproportionality at the state, district, and school levels through reliance on national databases (Sullivan & Artiles, 2011) . This analyses suggested that earlier studies may also have failed to accurately represent the factors related to individualas opposed to group-risk. Moreover, such analyses generally prevented the analysis of multiple dimensions of difference simultaneously and erroneously assume within group homogeneity (Shifrer et al., 2011) . Taken together, these shortcomings and the present results emphasize the need to study disproportionality through student or multilevel data. These findings also call for greater exploration of disparities in the low-incidence disabilities.\nThese results also highlight the need to consider the ways in which race, gender, and SES intersect to produce differential risk of disability through the structuring of opportunity and the construction of risk/disability. Earlier research examining district-or school-level risk suggested \"poverty makes a weak and inconsistent contribution to the prediction of disproportionality\" (Skiba et al., 2005, p. 130 ). The present study and similar analyses Shifrer et al., 2011) demonstrate that low income is consistently predictive of elevated risk in the high-incidence categories. These findings highlight the importance of a comprehensive conceptualization of SES in studying disproportionality, but do not explain the observed differences. Earlier scholars suggested race is a proxy for SES in disproportionality (MacMillan & Reschly, 1998) and that the overrepresentation of racial minority children among the poor results in differential susceptibility; but this explanation may be too simplistic (Artiles & Bal, 2008) . More research is needed to understand the dynamic intersections of race, class, and disability, because this disproportionality may result from cognitive sequelea of poverty; differential treatment of poor students in identification process; or differential opportunity to learn in a racially and economically stratified society.\nThe observed attenuation of race effects also point to a need to move beyond a simplistic focus on race to more nuanced examinations of cultural-historical context and educational opportunities that account for intersectionality in students' lived experiences. Scholars have suggested that disproportionality may be caused by differential ability/susceptibility or differential opportunity (Coutinho & Oswald, 1998) , but these explanations have not been supported, perhaps because they ignore the full scope of ecological factors shaping educational risk. Future research should explore how different demographic, school, family, and community factors interact to produce under-or overrepresentation in special education.\nThese findings support the need for future research examining the processes through which educational policies and procedures are applied to different groups across contexts. For instance, the finding regarding CI identification in schools with high rates of retention points to the need to examine how educational decisions are made for students with borderline functioning. These results suggest that some schools may retain students rather than identify them as CI. More studies of the referral and identification processes are needed-particularly the team eligibility determination process. Previous research has tended to consider distinct professionals (e.g., school psychologists, referring general education teachers) rather than the team process in which they are engaged (for an exception, see Klingner & Harry, 2006 Moreover, the findings here, combined with those by Hibel and colleagues (2010) suggest that disproportionality research should dedicate greater attention to school policies and procedures related to instruction and discipline and their implications for students' academic difficulties and treatment within the context of special education referral and identification. The lack of convergence across the more recent multilevel studies of disproportionality also underscores the importance of locality, as has been recognized elsewhere (Sullivan & Artiles, 2011) , which further supports the contextually dependent nature of patterns of disproportionality and the need for more research to understand how locality affects special education risk. As Artiles and Bal (2008) suggest, \"researchers need to document processes and outcomes in such fashion that help understand local experiences\" (p. 6) and \"should transcend the traditional exclusive focus on the various groups represented in schools (e.g., linguistic, socioeconomic, ethnic) and document the ways these students' cultural practices intersect with school cultural practices to construct and maintain inequitable conditions\" (p. 7).\nNote that documentation of disproportionality is not problematic in and of itself, but may be indicative of inequities related to the underlying general and special education policies and practices (Rueda & Windmueller, 2006) . In identifying numerous disparities in identification patterns, these results further emphasize the need to explore the validity of the educational practices that precede and follow special education identification. More specifically, researchers and practitioners must consider two major questions: (a) Are the instructional, prereferral, and assessment practices that contribute to special education identification valid and equitable? and (b) Are the instructional and intervention practices provided through special education valid and equitable? Exploration of these questions should take into consideration the dimensions of difference along which disproportionality is observed, namely, the intersections of gender, race, and SES."}, {"section_title": "P R A C T I C A L IMPLIC AT I O N S", "text": "These results have implications for educational professionals of all types and levels because they underscore the importance of social structures (e.g., race, class, and gender relations), school policy, and practice (e.g., retention and discipline) in the treatment of children with academic difficulties. The results highlight the need to examine multiple dimensions of difference when analyzing disproportionality as part of systemic monitoring and improvement efforts. Whereas the findings here and from this strand of scholarship generally do not allow for causal inference, they do point to dimensions warranting attention in daily practice. School districts tend to focus on race because of IDEA requirements, but policy makers, administrators, and educators should also be cognizant of broader disparities in identification and outcomes. Practitioners should examine potential disparities in the application of discipline, intervention, referral, and evaluation procedures and practices with diverse learners to understand constructions of differences based on intersecting statuses (e.g., SES with race and gender). Efforts should focus on (a) preventing inappropriate identification where academic difficulties result from factors outside of disability (e.g., cultural difference, lack of learning opportunities) and (b) providing access to preventative services and interventions that may mitigate mild disabilitiesparticularly among racial minority males from lower SES backgrounds."}, {"section_title": "F I N A L T H O U G H T S", "text": "This study examined special education disproportionality by examining both univariate and bivariate risk across multiple disability categories and sociodemographic characteristics and individual and school predictors of individual student identification for special education. This study confirms that the relations of predictive variables vary across disability categories. When only the risk index was considered, severe racial disproportionality was observed. Multilevel modeling, however, revealed that these relations were attenuated when other sociodemographic and school factors were accounted for. In particular, this analysis underscored the intersections of race, class, and gender in disproportionality and highlighted the importance of school policies and practices related to discipline and retention. The present findings support the conclusions of recent researchers that disability identification is socially (Shifrer et al., 2011) and contextually based and call attention to the need to examine the mechanisms by which sociodemographics, school policy, and educational practices affect disproportionality, to foster appropriate educational opportunities for all through systemic solutions focused on enhancing access to quality educational services and supports within both general and special education. Such an approach recognizes that the study of disproportionality is rooted in concerns for the capacity of schools to support diverse learners."}]
