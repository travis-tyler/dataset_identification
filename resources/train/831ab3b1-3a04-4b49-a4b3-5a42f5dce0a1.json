Increasing nitrogen use efficiency by adopting eco-innovations such as nitrogen soil testing, plant tissue testing and nitrogen transformation inhibitors can ameliorate this problem. Data from the 2010 USDA Agricultural Resource Management Survey of corn producers was used to examine the factors affecting adoption of these practices. Twenty-one percent of the 1840 corn farmers had adopted nitrogen soil testing, three percent had adopted plant tissue testing and ten percent had adopted nitrogen inhibitors. A multivariate probit regression found significant results for each category of explanatory varia ble that was examined. Older farmers were less likely to adopt nitrogen soil testing and nitrogen inhibitors. Farmers who did not obtain external nitrogen recommendations were less likely to adopt all three practices than farmers who received recommendations from a crop consultant. Those who received recommendations from fertilizer dealers were less likely to adopt nitrogen soil testing. Those who indicated that high prices influenced their decision to plant corn on that field were more likely to adopt plant tissue testing but less likely to adopt the other two practices. All regions were more likely to adopt nitrogen soil testing than the Midwest. Those who adopted conservation tillage were more likely to adopt nitrogen inhibitors and those who received conservation payments were more likely to adopt nitrogen soil testing and plant tissue testing. Adoption was also associated with the adoption of several other technologies."}, {"section_title": "1", "text": "Chapter 1 -Introduction"}, {"section_title": "Motivation", "text": "In the past decade the United States has increased corn production as increasing demand has raised prices (USDA 2014a). This demand has spurred farmers to bring millions of more acres into production 1 . Increased capacity can be coupled with new innovations that allow for increasing productivity per acre and better environmental stewardship (Pingali 2012;FAO 2002). But despite food security and economic benefits of increased U.S. corn production, there is increasing concern regarding biodegradation of aquatic ecosystems due to agricultural chemical inputs (Galloway et al. 2004;Mitsch et al. 1999). Anthropogenically introduced nitrogen for agricultural production has compromised water quality, biological diversity, and threatens human health all over the world (Robertson and Vitousek 2009;Galloway et al. 2004). Nitrogen fertilizer is largely produced by the Haber-Bosch process allowing for the dramatic increase in world food production in the last century (Sutton et al. 2011;Townsend et al. 2012). Nitrogen is an essential element for plant life and therefore in agriculture-meaning it cannot be replaced by technological substitutes, as chlorofluorocarbons were substituted in industrial processes by non-ozone depleting chemicals (Mosier et al. 2001). From 1961 to 2011, nitrogen fertilizer consumption in the US increased by 324% (USDA 2013). Corn is the most widely planted crop and receives the highest nitrogen 2 application rates per acre (Ribaudo et al. 2012). The 2013 crop year saw an estimated 87.2 million acres of corn harvested for grain that yielded almost 14 billion bushels -a 5 billion bushel jump from 2002 (USDA 2014b). Annual nitrogen application provides crops with needed nutrition. But overapplication (i.e. exceeding agronomic fertilizer targets) can occur because added nitrogen can serve as a form of insurance or risk management at a relatively low cost compared to potential yield loss (Williamson 2011;Billen et al. 2013). The USDA estimated that in 2006 approximately 65% of surveyed cropland did not follow nitrogen best management practices (Ribaudo et al. 2011). This, coupled with other factors, makes agriculture in the U.S. and many other countries the leading source of non-point source pollution in surface and coastal waters (Warner 2008;OECD 2001). Additional nitrogen from agriculture has changed the global nitrogen cycle leading to severe impacts on aquatic systems and the organisms that rely on them (Billen et al. 2013). Nitrogen can be lost in surface and ground water leading to excess plant bioma ss and a depletion of oxygen (Billen et al. 2013;Chambers et al. 2011). A growing mobilized nitrogen imbalance has increased the need for greater nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) (Galloway et al. 2004; Robertson and Vitousek 2009;Vitousek et al. 1997). NUE is the quantitative measure of grain produced per unit of fertilizer applied (Ciampitti and Vyn 2011) and will be used throughout this study when discussing agricultural eco-innovations. Farmers can increase NUE by adopting best management practices (BMPs), nitrogenefficient plant varieties, precision agriculture, and other eco-innovations that diminish environmental externalities (Mosier et al. 2001;Tscharntke et al. 2012;Ribaudo et al. 2012;Chen et al. 2008). Eco-innovations or technological environmental innovations, change the ecological properties of a society's metabolism (Huber 2008b). Changing a society's metabolism refers to \"new technologies and practices that change the operative structures and ecological properties of production and consumption, and thus relieve strain on resources and environmental sinks\" (Huber 2008a:361). Innovations that protect health and the environment can include reducing negative externalities of contamination, increasing biological safety, and improving long -term ecosystem health (Kemp and Volpi 2008). Agricultural eco-innovations can possibly decrease cost and/or increase yield by being more efficient with inputs and reducing capital, labor, and energy-using outputs. A broad classification of agriculturally-based innovations includes: mechanical innovations (e.g. improving tractor equipment), biological innovations (hybrid seeds), chemical innovations (more efficient fertilizers), agronomic innovations (new tilling practices), biotechnological innovations (genetically modified organisms), and precision technologies (GPS and variable-rate technology) (Sunding and Zilberman 1999). Adoption of such innovations over time has changed global agricultural productivity (McBrantney, Whelan, and Ancev 2005;McBride and Daberkow 2003). Just as economic analysis takes into account the added cost and value at each stage of production, agricultural benefits and impacts need to consider all stages in order to capture truly eco-efficient farming practices. Knowledge of environmental processes, minimization of non-renewable inputs, and collective action towards natural resource solutions can be brought into a broadened sustainable production perspective as society 4 continues to face decreasing energy supplies and increased environmental pollution (Elliot and Cole 1989;Pretty 2008). Therefore, analyzing adoption of agricultural eco-innovations is critical in both understanding and adjusting the way we present information and develop policy relating to agriculture and the environment. The section below presents specific research questions and overall goals of this study."}, {"section_title": "Specific Research Questions", "text": "\uf0b7 What are determining factors affecting adoption by corn farmers of nitrogen soil testing, plant tissue testing, and nitrogen transformation inhibitors? \uf0b7 How do these factors compare to previous agricultural innovation adoption studies? \uf0b7 How do these research results help to improve farm practices, and educational outreach to promote voluntary adoption of environmentally sound practices that ultimately improve water quality? In order to understand factors that may influence adoption of NUE innovations, we must first understand the context and biological processes that occur. Examination of nitrogen fertilizer use and its relationship with the environment will be covered in the next chapter. Chapter 3 is a literature review on adoption and diffusion of innovations and their role in moving society towards a more sustainable farming system. Survey information and analytical methods are found in Chapter 4. Summary statistics, CART models, and multivariate regression results are analyzed and discussed in Chapter 5. Chapter 6 provides conclusions and final thoughts on this research."}, {"section_title": "Chapter 2 -Background", "text": "Part of the problem in targeting agricultural nitrogen non-point source pollution is its complex nature and its widespread effects over millions of heterogeneous agents. Complexity of the nitrogen cycle \"provides multiple points of management intervention; on the other hand, it hides interactions among different processes\" (Robertson and Vitousek 2009:99). The multifaceted framework and diverse stakeholder base creates a wicked problem (Rittel and Webber 1973). Classic problems in science and mathematics usually operate in restrained or \"tame\" environments where laws and theories are predictable and measurable (Rittel and Webber 1973:160). Wicked problems are illustrated as having unpredictable outcomes and incorporating multiple user groups representing a variety of desired outcomes (Batie 2008). Non-point source pollution from agriculture is a wicked problem. There is no ultimate solution, only a resolution of pollution mitigation by users (Arias et al. 2000)."}, {"section_title": "Nitrogen and Agriculture", "text": "Agricultural history helps to explain the problems, policies, and productivity we have today (David, 1994). Therefore a basic historical introduction is critical in understanding the depth and breadth of environmental challenges linked to farm production. Regarding nitrogen, increasing use of fertilizers on crops started in the 19 th century (Melillo 2012). Between the 1840s and 1930s hundreds of millions of tons of nitrogen-rich guano and sodium nitrate (NaNO3) were shipped to farmers in North America and Europe from Peru and Chile."}, {"section_title": "6", "text": "This increase in agricultural productivity during the Industrial Revolution is characterized by some as the 'First Green Revolution' (Melillo 2012). Historians usually refer to the Green Revolution as the array of programs and policies that increased production and synthetic inputs that occurred in the 1960s and 70s. US Green Revolution policies led to a fertilizer-intensive approach of food and fiber production that has had a profound anthropogenic impact on the global nitrogen cycle (Pretty et al. 2010). The USDA has been tracking plant nutrient fertilizer consumption since the 1960s. Figure 1 shows the dramatic increase nitrogen use over a fifty year period. "}, {"section_title": "The Nitrogen Cycle", "text": "A rudimentary introduction to the nitrogen cycle is essential for implementing proper agricultural nutrient management and grasping the far reaching effects unnaturally high amounts of reactive nitrogen have on the surrounding ecosystem (Field 2004). When discussing nitrogen in general, N can be used as an abbreviation. When specifically discussing reactive nitrogen, many scientific papers use Nr as an abbreviation (Galloway et al. 2004), which includes biologically active ammonium (NH4 + ) and nitrate-nitrogen (NO3 -). Nitrogen (N) is a limiting element in many terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems (Galloway et al. 2004). N is essential in agriculture because it promotes greater plant growth and increases crop quality (Mitsch et al. 1999). Reactive nitrogen (Nr) that escapes agricultural production negatively impacts terrestrial, fresh water, marine ecosystems, and human health (Connor et al. 2011;Galloway et al. 2003). Nitrogen cycles in different chemical states between the atmosphere, soil, and plants (Borton and Porter 2008). Nitrogen gas (N2) is the most common gas in the atmosphere, making up 78% by volume in dry air (Field 2004). A corn plant will only readily uptake two forms of Nr; ammonium (NH4 + ) and nitrate-nitrogen (NO3 -) (Nelson and Huber 1992). Two of the largest sources of nitrogen in the farm system are not readily used by plants, air and dead organic matter (DOM). The N2 double-bond in the atmospheric nitrogen gas is hard to break and therefore unusable by plants (Bardgett 2005). Over 90% of N in soil can be trapped as DOM which cannot be readily processed by plants. Plants will instead uptake ammonium or converted inorganic nitrogen in the soil that has occurred via 8 mineralization or N-fixing bacteria. The nitrogen cycle as it relates to water pollution and agriculture is shown in figure 2 below. Naturally introduced nitrogen can come from nitrogen fixing bacteria, soil microorganisms, and lighting strikes (Field 2004). Legumes can help accumulate plantuseable nitrogen in the soil by hosting a symbiotic bacterium that converts organic nitrogen to inorganic nitrogen in the root zone (Connor et al. 2011). Rotating legume crops (like soybeans) with corn can help to both naturally replenish N in the soil and prevent crop specific diseases (Billen et al. 2013;Pretty 2008). Lightning can add Nr to the soil from volatized nitrogen in the atmosphere, but is only considered an important source of Nr in areas that lack other large Nr sources (Galloway et al. 2004) and therefore is an insignificant Nr source for intensive industrial agriculture."}, {"section_title": "Anthropogenic Changes", "text": "Anthropogenic changes to the global nitrogen cycle can involve both redistribution of natural Nr sources or Nr from industrial fixation. As mentioned earlier, sodium nitrate can be mined and used as an Nr source. But until the late 1800s, nitrogen-fixing legumes and animal manure were primary sources of fertilizer for crop fields (Sutton et al. 2011). In the past, it was common to have both field crops and livestock-so waste manure was available on-site (Schroder 2005). Manure has benefits beyond Nr, including micronutrients and organic matter that helps build soil organic matter (Beckman and Livingston 2012). But its nutritional content can be unpredictable and depending on factors like proximity to manure source and manure state (solid or liquid) can be relatively expensive to apply compared to fertilizer from industrial fixation (Schroder 2005;Beckman and Livingston 2012). In 1908, the Haber-Bosch process allowed cheap ammonia fertilizer to be created on an industrial scale (Sutton et al. 2011). Humans' ability to produce massive amounts of Nr has allowed agriculture to feed the world-which cannot be discounted. However, producing massive amounts of Nr comes with a price. Both the intensive amount of energy (largely coming from fossil fuels) and the added Nr in the environment have led to increased pollution around the world (Sutton et al. 2011)."}, {"section_title": "Water Quality and Agriculture", "text": "Nitrate-nitrogen is highly mobile in water (Mitsch et al. 1999). Areas that have shallow groundwater that is used for human consumption can be at risk of nitrate pollution from agriculture. Once nitrates pollute groundwater, users must remove high level of nitrates before consumption-forcing secondary costs (Ribaudo et al. 2011). High nitrate levels in water can cause heart disease and methemoglobinemia (blue baby syndrome) (EPA 2010). The EPA has set a maximum contaminant level for drinking water in the U.S. to 10 milligrams per liter (mg/l) for nitrate-nitrogen. Figure 3 below is a map from the U.S. Geological Survey that shows areas at risk of nitrate contamination to s hallow ground water across the Continental U.S. (1999). Notice that areas known for intense agriculture, such as the Corn Belt, are dealing with higher levels nitrate pollution. Groundwater contamination is not the only environmental impact associated with movement of excess Nr. Eutrophication of surface waters can cause algae blooms, creating an oxygen level too low to support fish, shellfish, and other aquatic life (Field 2004). Excess mobile nitrogen leads to hundreds of hypoxic dead zones all over the world-many of which are directly related to increased fertilizer use (Field 2004;Billen et al. 2013). The decline of aquatic health in areas like the Gulf of Mexico has led to a decrease in recreational and commercial fisheries health affecting both the fishing industry and tourism (Mitsch et al. 1999)."}, {"section_title": "Mitigating N Loss in Agriculture", "text": "A crop field can lose applied fertilizer or naturally occurring nitrogen to water sources by soil erosion, denitrification 2 , runoff, volatilization, and leaching. Farm managers can take steps to minimize these losses by adjusting practices and adopting technology. Fertilizer applications can be timed and administered to foster efficient plant uptake before Nr leaches below the root zone (Connor et al. 2011). Leaching can be minimized by adjusting tile drainage and field contours which can decrease water movement on the surface and in subsurface soil (Mitsch et al. 1999). Depending on a variety of factors, commercial nitrogen fertilizer is usually applied in one or more of the following forms: nitrate, ammonia, ammonium, or urea (Mengel 1986). Nitrogen fertilizer can come in dry and liquid forms with application method varying from 12 surface to subsurface application. A farmer may choose to apply some or all fertilizer in the fall well before planting season because of better soil conditions, time savings, and labor and equipment demands (Randall and Vetsch 2005). Timing, rate, nitrogen form, and application method are all valuable components of N management because a plant's need for nutrients changes throughout the growing season. Figure 4 on the following page shows the varying nitrogen uptake in a typical corn plant. N uptake is relatively low at planting then rapidly increases at the end of June. In corn, one bushel can contain approximately 1 pound of nitrogen with close to half that nitrogen in the grain (Martin, Waldren, and Stamp 2006). Adequate and timely plantavailable nitrogen affects both grain number and grain weight (Liu et al. 2011). From a managerial perspective, crop nutrition must focus on meeting the nutritional needs of the plant not just applying a certain rate to a field (Connor et al. 2011). This means using the right amount of fertilizer at the right time. Proper timing and quantity can minimize nitrogen losses and decrease the farmer's fertilizer cost (Ribaudo et al. 2011). Some methods include side-dressing, variable rate N applications, and nitrogentransformation inhibitors. But farmers must take a holistic approach by incorporating a variety of technologies and practices if mitigation of non-point source pollution is to be observed on a large scale (Mitsch et al. 1999)."}, {"section_title": "Three Dependent Variables: NUE Innovations", "text": "Three nitrogen-use efficiency innovations were selected as dependent variables in the following adoption study. These three nitrogen efficient technologies have not been extensively studied: nitrogen soil testing, plant tissue testing, and nitrogen transformation inhibitors. A detailed description of each technology helps to explain both their value and role in increasing NUE in a farming system."}, {"section_title": "Nitrogen Soil Testing", "text": "A common tool for increasing NUE is the nitrogen soil test, which can use field-level data to help farmers decide on application quantities (Williamson 2011). This is both the oldest and most common of the three technologies being examined (Ribaudo et al. 2012). Soil testing determines the level of available nutrients in the soil (Peters and Laboski 2013). Nitrogen soil testing predicts the amount of plant-available nitrogen in the soil so preseason and in-furrow side-dressing applications can be more precise (Brouder and Mengel 2003). "}, {"section_title": "Nitrogen Transformation Inhibitors", "text": "In conjunction with this informative tool, nitrogen transformation inhibitors can be an added input to fertilizer applications in order to decrease volatilization and leaching (Upadhyay and Tewari 2011). This practice can be especially valuable for fall nitrogen applications (Frazen 2011). Both nitrogen transformation inhibitors and controlled-release fertilizer are recommended by NRCS as nutrient management conservation practices (2012). There are three classifications of nitrogen transformation inhibitors and controlled-release fertilizer. Nitrification inhibitors (NI) are chemicals that help reduce the transformation of nitrogen in the ammonium form to the nitrate form, and thus reduce losses of reactive nitrogen. These chemicals kill or interfere with the metabolism of bacteria that cause nitrification (Trenkel 2010 Urease inhibitors help to block the enzyme urease from converting urea to volatile ammonia (Trenkel 2010). Ammonium is converted to ammonia gas in the soil until it reaches equilibrium. When this gas is exposed at or near the surface, the gas can volatilize and be blown away, decreasing the overall nitrogen content in the soil and under certain conditions increasing NxO emissions (Upadhyay and Tewari 2011). The urease inhibitor can be applied to anhydrous ammonia, dry urea, and manure (Frazen 2011). A popular urease inhibitor is Agrotain\u00ae which also costs about $8 an acre depending on fertilizer application rate (Jackson 2012). Finally, controlled-release urea is a urea pellet that is covered in a material that slows the microbial activity around dry urea (Trenkel 2010). Thickness and imperfections in the coating slow release time and therefore delay plant-available nitrogen (Schwab and Murdock 2010). One coating type can be made of sulfur, which can be expensive. Another is PCU or poly-coated urea, which is a polymer coated urea that releases when adequate temperatures and/or moisture levels dissolve the outer coating. A leading PCU coated fertilizer called ESN\u00ae is priced at around $0.10/lb. higher than uncoated urea (Silva 2011). Different studies have found that the increased cost of nitrogen transformation inhibitors can be offset by preservation of fertilizer (Upadhyay and Tewari 2011; Frazen 2011).  Table 1 in Chapter 4 lists all the variables used in this study and provides a brief description. The following section is designed for readers without a strong agriculture background. Included is an introduction to precision agricultural technology and three technology variables used in the regression that complement the practices of interest."}, {"section_title": "Plant Tissue Testing", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Other Innovations for Nitrogen Management", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Precision Agriculture", "text": "Generically defined, precision agriculture (PA) is \"that kind of agriculture that increases the number of (correct) decisions per unit area of land per unit time with associated net benefits\" (McBrantney et al. 2005:8). This enhanced management strategy helps inform and improve farm-level decisions (Batte and Arnholt 2003). Precision farming can improve input selection for seed, pesticide, fertilizer, irrigation, and other inputs (Koch and Khosla 2003). Enhanced selection can then be economically optimized to enhance efficiency of application area and timing (McBrantney et al. 2005;Koch and Khosla 2003). Both impacts on farm inputs help to tailor management decisions to field needs-hopefully resulting in less environmental impact (Schimmelpfennig and Ebel 2011)."}, {"section_title": "Satellite Soil Maps", "text": "Satellite soil maps are field-level maps farmers can acquire that contain a variety of information (depending on the source). Simple maps can be used to get a general idea of soil type in a field. Alternatively in-depth maps can be created through agriculture service agencies that give details on soil types and management systems, drainage patterns, organic concentration, and management zones (SIC 2013). These types of maps aid in both in-season and pre-planting decisions that ultimately make field management more precise and efficient."}, {"section_title": "Remote Sensing", "text": "For farmers, remote sensing assesses their fields without physically touching them. Specifically, \"Remote sensing is the practice of deriving information about the Earth's land and water surfaces using images acquired from an overhead perspective, using electromagnetic radiation in one or more regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, reflected or emitted from the Earth's surface\" (Campbell and Vynne 2012:6). These remote sensing images can be taken from satellites and aircraft, giving the field manager an aerial view. Though this technology has existed since the 1950s, further advancements and benefits including decreased cost have made it recently appealing to the agricultural sector (Nowatzki et al. 2004). Now plant health can be determined by be comparing the spectral signatures from energy the crop reflects to known signatures of nutritional value. Remote sensing can also be combined to create geospatial data that pinpoints areas on the images with GIS (geographical information system) and others like it. This geospatial overlay began in the 1980s but did not fully mature until the mid-2000s (Campbell and Vynne 2012). Farmers can use images to look for nutrient deficiencies, diseases, water deficiency or surplus, weed infestations, insect damage, hail damage, wind damage, and herbicide damage (Nowatzki et al. 2004:1). These images are usually interpreted through a company or extension service that provides a farmer with a color scaled map showing nutrient deficient areas on his or her field. This information can then be relayed to variable rate technology (VRT) applications for precise fertilizer and pesticides applications (Nowatzki et al. 2004)."}, {"section_title": "Variable Rate Fertilizer", "text": "Variable rate fertilizer technology is a site-specific management tool that allows operators to vary the application rate of fertilizer across their field. This technology relies on other management practices to be fully implemented which may include soil testing and GPS guidance (NDSU 2013). Field zone application maps and GPS in-cab helps to accurately execute variations in fertilizer application across fields (Zhang et al. 2010). Farmers can also hire consultants to create maps and develop variable rate fertilizer plans (Batte and Arnholt 2003). For application simplicity, fields are commonly divided into zone management areas with different soil types, yield goals, and application rates (NDSU 2013;Zhang et al. 2010). This technology can increase NUE and has the potential to increase profitability (Colaco et al. 2012)."}, {"section_title": "Background Conclusions", "text": "This chapter briefly summarized the foundation of scientific and agricultural knowledge needed to further explore adoption of NUE eco-innovations by farmers.

Early sociology and economic literature tended to approach this topic from different directions. Sociologists focused heavily on social ties and information channels while early economists focused more on macro effects of innovations' impact on economic productivity (Antonelli 2003;Rogers 2003). Everett M. Rogers' now classic book, Diffusion of Innovations (published in 1962 and updated in 1971, 1983, 1995, and 2003) is referenced by most researchers in the field of adoption of innovations. Today, adoption and diffusion literature is very much a multi-disciplinary research effort with books and articles in rural sociology (Prokopy et al. 2008;Rogers 2003), economics (Pannell et al. 2006;Ruttan 1997), business (Baptista 1999), and marketing (Tidd 2010;Goldenberg et al. 2010)."}, {"section_title": "Innovation", "text": "\"An innovation is an idea, practice, or object that is perceived as new by an individual\" (Rogers 2003:12). This means that innovations maybe a disembodied process or an embodied product (Sunding and Zilberman 1999), like a new way to till a field (disembodied) or a GPS guidance system (embodied). In some cases, an embodied innovation can further be separated as the tool that embodies the technology or hardware (GPS system in a tractor) and the knowledge base for the tool or software (actually operating it) (Rogers 2003)."}, {"section_title": "20", "text": "An innovation has five main characteristics; (1) relative advantage, (2) compatibility, (3) complexity, (4) trialability, (5) observability (Rogers 2003). These characteristics are critical for individual adoption decisions of an innovation or technology 3 . In analyzing relative advantage it is useful to differentiate primary and secondary attributes of an innovation (Tidd 2010). Primary attributes are invariant and intrinsic to a particular innovation, regardless of adopter perspective. Whereas secondary attributes vary with the adopter perception of compatibility and relative advantage. The difference in secondary attributes across a potential adopter population is known as the \"attribute gap\" and the size of this gap sometimes can indicate innovation success (Tidd 2010:21). Compatibility of an innovation involves the degree to which an innovation is compatible with a potential adopter in both values and experience (Rogers 2003). Complexity deals with the level of understanding needed to adopt an innovation. Trialability involves the degree to which a potential adopter can experience the innovation, decreasing uncertainty. Finally, observability is concerned with visibility of an innovation-influencing peer-to-peer networks (Rogers 2003)."}, {"section_title": "Eco-Innovation", "text": "The term eco-innovation will be defined from Kemp and Pearson's 2007 study as the, \"[T]he production, application or exploitation of a good, service, production process, organizational structure, or management or business method that is novel to the firm or user and which results, throughout its life cycle, in a reduction of environmental risk, pollution and the negative impacts of resource use (including energy use) compared to relevant alternatives\" (7). Recall from Chapters 1 and 2 that environmental problems are very complex and more often there are less harmful alternatives rather than true solutions. Two key points to this definition; 1) it restates our original innovation definition 2) it adds a caveat of reducing negative environmental impact compared to relevant alternatives. Therefore an innovation does not have to be created specifically for environmental benefit, but rather if it does reduce negative environmental impact (compared to alternatives) can be brought under the umbrella of eco-innovation.   All four broad determinants impact the five characteristics of an innovation. Therefore to fully understand adoption of an eco-innovation, one must understand the innovation itself and its surrounding factors. These determinant factors can directly relate to factors influencing farmer adoption and diffusion of eco-innovations."}, {"section_title": "Adoption and Diffusion", "text": "Rogers (2003:5) defines diffusion as \"the process by which an innovation is communicated through certain channels over time among members of a social system. It is a special type of communication, in that messages are concerned with new ideas\". While interconnected, adoption and diffusion are individual concepts (Metcalfe 1988). Adoption \"is generally considered to be the decision to do or acquire something\" (Tidd 2010:5) i.e. the process of decision making. Diffusion is \"concerned with how the economic significance of a new technology (i.e. market share) changes over time\" (Leite and Teixeira 2011:126). Thus, adoption is an individual (micro) concept and diffusion is an aggregate (macro) concept. The generic pre-diffusion phase is made up of two parts; invention and development (Goel 1999). The pre-diffusion phase is viewed as complete by researchers when adoption has reached a threshold percentage of the population (Rogers 2003). This indicates that an innovation is available for adoption on a large scale, marking the beginning of the diffusion curve (Easingwood and Lunn 1992;Tidd 2010). Diffusion of an innovation is typically conveyed by a generic S-shaped curve. The curve stylizes the common phenomenon observed, where diffusion rate rises then falls over time. This is presumed to occur in an atmosphere of \"democratic equality of opportunity in respect to the interacting issue\" (Dodd 1955:398). The S-shaped curve commonly starts after the pre-diffusion phase which is marked at a population adoption percentage (ex. 10%) (Geroski 2000)."}, {"section_title": "Epidemic Model", "text": "The epidemic model has been a widely used in explaining diffusion (Tidd 2010; Meade and Islam 2010). Time distributions of adoption can result from \"contagious\" information about profitability or efficiency. Relating to medicine, contagion or epidemic models for disease are used as a proxy for modeling the spread of information (Antonelli 2003). However, the epidemic model is unrealistic in that adoption is assumed to occur in a static homogenous population were everyone is equally likely to catch the disease (Coombs et al. 1987), starting at introduction and ending at saturation (Meade and Islam 2010;Goel 1999;Rogers 2003)."}, {"section_title": "24", "text": "The S-shaped or sigmoid curve is common in explaining a diffusion pattern in a population (Barnett 2011). A special case of the logistic function is shown as a diffusion equation below. The P is the cumulative number of adopters or percent of population and t is time where t=1 is maturity of diffusion (Barnett 2011:104;Menard 2009)."}, {"section_title": "= + \u2212", "text": "(1) The initial growth stage of early adopters to majority adopters (0 < t < \u00bd) is exponential. The growth begins decaying exponentially after 50% (saturation) and then continues to slow (\u00bd< t < 1) until t=1, when growth stops (Barnett 2011). It is important to point out that empirically, this late growth usually occurs slower than an S-shaped model would predict. Asymmetric properties stem from varying diffusion rates in the population group (Geroski 2000). A related theory is that of imitation. Schumpeter viewed imitation as the methodological driver of technology diffusion , where entrepreneurial innovation successes lead to imitation of that innovation in the market. The S-shaped curve can be used to divide adopters into groups by measuring the relative rate of speed at which an innovation is adopted and thus the innovativeness of that society (Rogers 2003). Rogers (2003) describes innovativeness as, the ability of a person to adopt new innovations in comparison to their social system. \"Adopter categories, the classifications of member of a social system on the basis of innovativeness, include: (1) innovators, (2) early adopters, (3) early majority, (4) late majority, and (5) laggards\" (22).  Another way of describing a typical diffusion study is by substituting t in the previous equation for -\u03b1-\u03b2t, where \u03b1 determines the starting point of the diffusion curve and \u03b2 is the slope of the curve, shown in equation 2 below (Coombs et al. 1987:122). This allows for varying start times and various rates of diffusion to be entered into the S-shaped equation. Different \u03b2-coefficients were used in this type of equation for Grilliches' hybrid corn study (1957) mentioned later in this chapter.

Bass (1969)  assumes that the adopting individuals are homogenous and fully connected; therefore a macro-level model could be construed (Bass 1969). (3) Many econometricians criticized Bass's homogenous social model because it did not incorporate the economic factors like income that change overtime despite the fact it closely modeled diffusion data (Bass et al. 1994;Bonus 1973; Meade and Islam 2010). Rogers (1962) argued that normally distributed individual adoption model shape was observed because of a population relatedness to the innovation and how heterogeneous the population is in their propensity to innovate (p). Bass's original model later evolved into the 'Generalized Bass Model' which included decision variables and hazard rate 4 (Bass et al. 1994). The model presumes that early adopters are mostly influenced by media while the later adopters are persuaded by communication channels. This model is influential in economics and marketing (Tidd 2010), and produces a skewed S-shaped curve with necessary flexibility for heterogeneous attributes."}, {"section_title": "Technology and Adoption", "text": "People and the environment are extraordinarily complex. The answers for improving ecosystem health by predicting human behavior are equally complex and must be calculated under uncertainty and with imperfect understanding. When integrating complex, nested systems into framework and theory, the extraordinary diversity and complexity of the world must be acknowledged (Ostrom and Basurto 2011). For adoption studies, this leads to particular variables of interest representing aspects of adoption from previous investigations typically focused on micro-level behavior (Rogers 2003). These variables could be education, age, time taken for adoption decisions, business practices, information source, comparative financial capabilities, and geographic location (Rogers 2003;Prokopy et al. 2008;Katz et al. 1963)."}, {"section_title": "Previous Diffusion and Adoption Studies", "text": "A seminal study of diffusion of innovation was by Ryan and Gross (1943) (Griliches 1957).

This means scientific reasoning should be behind every selected independent variable followed by critical analysis of those findings. However necessary, modeling adoption and diffusion of NUE and BMPs is challenging. In the case of nitrogen pollution, it is infeasible to involve every farmer (i.e. stakeholder) on an individual basis. Understanding user groups, behavior, and tendencies are then vital for prudent policy development and targeted outreach-increasing the need for eco-innovation adoption studies. Modeling adoption of agricultural eco-innovations that contribute to nitrogen mitigation can assist in taming this wicked problem. Below are a series of important variables found in prior analyses of adoption of agricultural technology. Each section has a brief summary of synthesized research. Universality of variable influence on adoption is rare. Knowler and Bradshaw's (2007) synthesis of 31 empirical studies on conservation agriculture adoption found few if any universal variables that predict adoption. But these synthesized research findings help develop and justify hypothesized variables of influence particular to this study."}, {"section_title": "The Farmer: Education and Information", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Information Sources", "text": "Understanding information inputs in the innovation processes contribute to understanding of the potential user's communication and collaboration trends as they are associated with adoption (Coombs et al. 1987;Mowery and Rosenberg 1979). The importance of communication channels and proximity to other adopters was shown in early technology adoption studies (Dodd 1955;Griliches 1957;Mansfield 1961;Ryan and Gross 1943). A common source of information studied by agricultural economics and rural sociology is the amount of interaction or information a farmer has with an agricultural extension agency. This coincides to Rogers (1962), Grilliches (Hybrid Corn: An exploration in the economics of technological change 1957), and Ryan and Gross's (1943) original emphasis on proximity to communication channels and type of social ties. Prokopy et al. (2008) concluded that utilization of social networks and access to information are critical in increasing farmers' likelihood to adopt. Miller et al. (2008) found that a relationship or proximity to an extension agent was significant in increasing adoption. Other studies also found that contact with agricultural extension information sources increase the likelihood to innovate compared to farmers without extension contact (Wozniak 1986). But whether it be number of visits to an extension agency (Koundouri, Nauges, and Tzouvelekas 2006), or general communication (Wozniak 1986), the extension variable has been shown to have inconsistent significance (Daberknow and McBride 1998;McBride and Daberkow 2003;Saha et al. 1994;Soule 2001). However, since the early 1990s farmers have greater access to better information which could undermine the impact of the extension role with farmers (McBrantney, Whelan, and Ancev 2005;McBride and Daberkow 2003)."}, {"section_title": "Human Capital and Education", "text": "Human capital and differences in knowledge of new technology have been shown to change the likelihood of adoption (Wozniak 1986;Khanna et al. 1999). Increasing human capital by higher education or training \"enhances one's ability to receive, decode, and understand information, and that information processing and interpretation is important for performing or learning to perform many jobs\" (Nelson and Phelps 1966:69). An increase in human capital creates a 'worker effect'-the marginal product of education, and 'allocative effect'-the allocative enhancement of current resources due to increased education (Welch 1970:42). Economic research has shown that an allocative effect has stronger analytical power than 'entrepreneurial capacity' (Huffman 1974;Welch 1970). Farmers with more education get more additional benefit from information sources because of their heightened ability to 'decode information' (Huffman 1974). Huffman found that education and agricultural extension contact had a positive impact in nitrogen efficiency and hypothesized that agricultural extension agents can be \"substitutes for some of the advantages associated with additional schooling\" (96). In this context extension, consultant, contractor, or fertilizer dealer contact may increase human capital. But in today's high tech information age the role of personal interactions may be changing because of integration of user-friendly technology (i.e. cell phones, tablets, and farming applications) (Klerkx et al. 2012). Education and information help decision makers overcome \"resistance created by adoption costs and uncertainty\" (Wozniak 1986:110). Feder and Slade (1984) found that larger farmers were more likely to allocate larger amounts of resources to the acquisition of education and information, leading to earlier adoption of new technology. Other studies confirmed education significance (Daberknow and McBride 1998;McBride and Daberkow 2003;Khanna 2001;Soule 2001;Huffman 1974;Koundouri et al. 2006; But not all studies found education to be significant (Saha et al. 1994;Fuglie and Bosch 1995;Soule 2001). However the trend remains that as more adoption-related information is available and knowledge capital is better able to decipher the informationmaking adoption is more likely (Rogers 2003;Prokopy et al. 2008;Klerkx et al. 2012)."}, {"section_title": "Age and Experience", "text": "Age and experience differ from education and have been found to have mixed results in adoption studies (Knowler and Bradshaw 2007). Commonly, age is thought to be negatively related to adoption because of shorter time horizons and lack of willingness to change Rogers 2003;Upadhyay et al. 2002a). Sometimes the particular technology matters; for example  found soil erosion was more likely recognized by older more experienced farmers but alternative tillage practices are more readily adopted by younger less experienced farmers. Wozniak (1986) found that though education was positively significant for use of a new cattle feed additive, experience was significantly negative-indicating that newer members of an industry may be more apt to try new things. But experience is commonly not a significant factor in eco-innovation adoption studies (Fuglie and Bosch 1995;Khanna 2001). Torbett et al (2008) found that farmers over 50 were actually more likely to use precision farming technology for nitrogen fertilizer efficiency. They hypothesize that the experienced older farmers are able to \"recognize and reap the benefits of improvements in N efficiency more than younger adopters\" (Torbett et al. 2008:144). But a study done a decade earlier by Daberkow and McBride (1998) using the 1996 ARMS survey contrasted this notion, finding farmers under 50 were more likely to adopt precision technology. Other studies also support the generalized concept of younger farmers being more likely to adopt new practices than older ones (McBride and Daberkow 2003;. A study by Napier and Tucker (2001) found that ability to recognize watershed issues had a weak but positively significant impact on adoption of watershed protection policies, but found no one factor extremely important to adoption. Other studies found experience was significant in influencing adoption decision of farmers (Ervin and Ervin 1982;Saha et al. 1994;Daberknow and McBride 1998). However, several studies did not find experience to be a significant factor whatsoever (Fuglie and Bosch 1995). These studies differed on particular innovations, but the variety of outcomes reveals the interaction of other influential variables on adoption."}, {"section_title": "Off-Farm Employment", "text": "Off-farm employment has been found to be negatively associated with adoption in a variety of studies and is usually associated with smaller farm size (i.e. part-time farmers) (Knowler and Bradshaw 2007). Off-farm income allows some farmers to increase household income, avoid income variability, and lower risk (Fernandex-Cornejo et al. 2005;Mishra and Goodwin 1997;Upadyay et al. 2002b). Operators whose major occupation was off-farm employment were found to be less aware of new agricultural technologies (Daberknow and McBride 1998;McBride and Daberkow 2003;. The reliance on off-farm income was negatively correlated with involvement in educational outreach, farm size, and receipts of government payments in a study of off-farm income and its effects on Kansas farmer characteristics (Mishra and Goodwin 1997). In a nationwide survey Fernandez-Cornejo et al. (2005) found adoption of herbicide tolerant soybeans to be positively related to off-farm income-interpreting this as a possible savings in management time for weed control.

Huffman's findings on nitrogen technology found economies of scale with adoption of nitrogen efficiency practices (Huffman 1974). A meta-analysis by Prokopy et al. (2008) suggests that BMP efforts should be directed toward farmers with larger acreages and more income and capital. Soule (2001) found N inhibitors and plant tissue testing were more readily adopted by farmers with high sales using the 1996 corn ARMS data. Other similar studies also found the amount of land and capital was an influential variable (Feder and Slade 1984). A survey of conservation agriculture adoption found overall impact of farm size and capital holdings in studies inconclusive (Knowler and Bradshaw 2007) and farm size or acres in operation was found negatively correlated (Clay et al. 1998;Khanna 2001) or insignificant (Nowak 1987) in other research. Overall the innovation itself seemed to be important in the significance of farm size and adoption when evaluating conservation and environmental innovations. In some adoption studies land ownership status has been assessed when predicting adoption. Based on Knowler and Bradshaw's survey of adoption literature (Farmers' adoption of conservation agriculture: A review and synthesis of recent research 2007), land tenure not been an important factor in assessing adoption. But in relation to the implementation of conservation practices, some studies did indicate that rented or leased land was negatively associated with adoption (Khanna 2001;Soule 2001). Upadyay et al. (2002a;2002b) found insignificant negative impacts on land rented and conservation adoption-concluding that shorter time horizons could be affecting adoption of BMPs. The shorter time horizon of renters and adoption tends to be substantiated by the economic theory of rational choice."}, {"section_title": "Profitability", "text": "Profitability of an innovation as perceived by the farmer tends to be evaluated prior to adoption and can be significant in the decision to adopt or not adopt an eco-innovation (Napier and Tucker 2001;Prokopy et al. 2008). A study on watershed protection by farmers in three states found that profitability was the highest ranked factor in adoption decisions (Napier and Tucker 2001). Profitability from potential calculated yield based on theoretical implementation was also highly significant in predicting adoption in other agricultural innovation studies (Koundouri et al. 2006;Saha et al. 1994;Ryan and Gross 1943). The potential valuation of profitability by a farmer can be sometimes far lower than the valuation of adoption to society (Ervin and Mill 1985;Napier and Tucker 2001). This is because the lack of social-benefit payment for adoption practices are not always present in the farmer's valuation (Ervin and Mill 1985;Koundouri et al. 2006). This can sometimes be due to a shorter planning horizon in calculating benefit compared to benefit by society (Gardner and Barrows 1985). This means that farmer's age and passage of the family farm is an added factor when calculating profitability as it pertains to the environment (Gardner and Barrows 1985;Robertson and Vitousek 2009)."}, {"section_title": "Geographic and Location Dummy Variables", "text": "Geographic location dictates climate, restricts plant species, and can isolate demographic characteristics. Therefore, adoption rates can also vary by region (Griliches 1957;Rogers 2003). Making geography endogenous in an adoption model can be done with a number of variables; regional dummy variables, soil type, climate, average rainfall, proximity to a metropolitan area, etc. Khanna (2001) found that farm location both with state dummy variables and soil type was a key variable in influencing adoption of sitespecific technologies. Farmers with higher quality soils had a higher probability of adopting, but greatest environmental impacts are generated on lower productive soils. This indicates potential societal benefit from a targeted educational outreach to farmers with lower quality soils (Khanna 2001). Several studies found regional variables to be significant for the awareness of environmental problems and adoption of new techniques (Griliches 1957; 2011; . Studies that examined fertilizer management or application techniques also found farm location to be a significant factor in mana gement (Soule 2001). Other geographic-related variables like amount of precipitation, temperature and irrigation practices have been shown to be positively correlated with nitrogen management techniques (Soule 2001).

This also is true for both variable rate technology (VRT) and yield monitor adoption. VRT uses GPS readings to target specific application to parts of the field. Early on, many farmers found VRT complex, which hindered early adoption (Khanna et al. 1999;McBrantney et al. 2005). A Texas study found that younger farmers managing larger farms were more likely to adopt VRT (Napier and Tucker 2001).

But \"economics is a different type of science, based on the power of deductive theories derived from a minimum number of basic assumptions about the individual and how individuals are related to one another and a physical world\" (237). Because of this, economics becomes a powerful microscope for investigating social and environmental problems. Under rational choice, the rational farmer has three main elements: 1) methodological individualism, 2) utility-maximization, and 3) existence of various institutional or strategic constraints on individual choice (Pollack 2006). This \"theory of advice\" helps inform individuals and institutions, about how best to achieve objectives, especially when it comes to environmental resources (Ostrom 1991:238). Naturally, as incentives and benefits change, farmer response to environmental problems may also change (Clearfield and Osgood 1986;Miller et al. 2008;Pingali 2012). Farm sector diffusion of labor-saving and productivity enhancing innovations is fairly well studied (Rogers 2003). These two types of innovations can reduce marginal cost and as a result increase profit-making adoption in the farmer's self-interest (Miller, Mariola, and Hansen 2008). But environmental innovation does not always inherently increase efficiency and decrease cost, in fact adoption may increase farmer's cost and risk depending on the innovation (Knowler and Bradshaw 2007). Adding to this problem, environmental market failure can construct a scenario where society bears the cost of pollution while the landowner generates profit or a landowner bears the cost of pollution mitigation and society largely receives benefit (Miller et al. 2008;Anderson and Leal 2001). Specifically for more environmentall y sustainable adoption practices, individual adoption needs to be carefully analyzed. In economics, profit is not always the defining objective; instead perception of benefits to a farmer's personal utility curve is theorized (Miller et al. 2008). This complexity and adopter variance is why a variety of factors need to be examined when attempting to model conservation practices and eco-adoption (Knowler and Bradshaw 2007;Miller et al. 2008). The next chapter will discuss the methods used in this study to model eco-innovation adoption. The ARMS survey is a national survey of Continental United States farms. The survey covers specific crops on a rotating basis with major commodities (corn, soybeans, wheat, cotton, dairy, and hogs) being surveyed more frequently than others. This survey is sensitive because it contains spatial information; because of this, ARMS data is available to researchers on a limited basis. Researchers can request access to raw ARMS data \"who have collaborative projects with ERS or NASS that contribute to USDA's public sector mission\" (ERS 2012c)."}, {"section_title": "Understanding the ARMS Survey", "text": "The survey is done in a series of one-on-one interviews with farm operators.

This selected independent variable creates a binary split that forms two stems. Each stem has a node called a child node that represents a group, in this case farmer groups. The method repeats itself from each node until no more sub-groups can be made that reduce deviation from the response variable or the number of observations in a node gets too small. The last nodes on branch are called terminal nodes. Tree growth can also be stopped by the researcher by limiting the minimum number of observations in a child node or limiting the number of stems a tree can have.

Particularly for marketing, decision trees can be valuable in segmenting customers, taking a heterogeneous group of customers and splitting them into smaller more homogenous groups in order to target customers and understand related behavior (McCarty and Hastak 2007). CART may detect interactions between variables that may be hard to detect using only regression techniques (Lewis 2000;Coussement et al. 2014).

Focusing on NUE technology, a farmer either adopts (y=1) or does not adopt (y=0) a technology, forming the dependent variable. Then, given a variety of factors that influence adoption likelihood for a farmer ( 1 , 2 , 3 , \u2026 ), the probability of adoption is denoted as, = ( = 1| ) (Greene 2003). For probit models, we assume pi is given by the standard normal distribution, \u03a6( \u2032 ). The probit regression is as follows,  The error terms, variance, and covariance denoted as, The first two equations mean the error terms have a multivariate normal distribution where the expected values of the error terms equal zero and variances equal one.

Before interpreting the results in the following chapter, it is important to note that all three continuous variables (farmer's age, acres in operation, yield goal per acre) were transformed by a logarithm for the multivariate probit regression. This was done to shrink the range of the variables in order to converge the algorithm. The ConservationTillage binary variable was created to represent conservation, no till, and minimum till farmers, with zero being none of those three practices.

The remaining variables are binary and were not altered from the original USDA ARMS dataset."}, {"section_title": "Specific Hypotheses", "text": "Explanatory variables used in the regression model and their hypothesized signs are given in table 1 below. In our model, independent variables fall into four main categories: education and information, location and size, farm practices , and technology. Education and information predictors include higher level of schooling and sources of information (consultant, contractor 5 , extension agents and fertilizer dealers). These variables assume a link between education and knowledge (Knowler and Bradshaw 2007) and have been shown to increase likelihood of adoption (Khanna et al. 1999); other similar studies found mixed results for both education and information sources (Daberknow and McBride 1998;McBride and Daberkow 2003;Saha et al. 1994;Soule 2001). Age is another commonly studied adoption indicator. Older farmers typically have shorter planning horizons ), but the influence age has on adoption probability can vary with the nature of individual innovations (Knowler and Bradshaw 2007;Torbett et al. 2008). For this study younger farmers are predicted to have a higher likelihood of adoption of NUE's based on an increased time horizon and more time to learn-by-using the innovations (Rogers 2003;McBride and Daberkow 2003;Khanna 2001). In addition to farmer characteristics and information sources, a variable called HighPrices was added as a proxy for farmer's motivation to plant corn in 2010 instead of another crop. This variable could be positively related to adoption of win-win technologies since these farmers are focused on increasing profitability, or it could be negatively related to adoption if the practices are viewed as just environmentally friendly. The last variable in this category is federal crop insurance which is predicted to be positively related to adoption. Federal crop insurance was not subject to environmental compliance in 2010 (Claassen 2012), however it can be thought of as a substitute for more nitrogen fertilizer application 'insurance' and may reduce overuse (Mulvaney et al. 2008;Huang et al. 2000;Ribaudo et al. 2011). Location and size variables include regional dummy variables, with Midwest being chosen as the base since it is the largest corn producing region. Like similar studies, we expect that our three win-win technologies would have higher adoption rates in regions where they are most profitable (Beckman and Livingston 2012;Gedikoglu and McCann 2012). Other adoption studies using ARMS survey data that examined fertilizer management or application techniques found farm location to be a significant factor in management (McBride and Daberkow 2003;Khanna 2001;Chang and Boisvert 2009). As mentioned earlier, farm size and farm income can increase the likelihood of adoption in many cases based on economies of scale and increased ability to bear risk (Khanna 2001;. The prediction in our model is that increasing farm size leads to increased likelihood of adoption. Current adoption of farm practices can be an important predictor of NUE innovation adoption (Knowler and Bradshaw 2007). Environmental awareness has been found to be an indicator of likelihood of adoption, especially related to conservation practices like no till (Prokopy et al. 2008). Our study hypothesizes that adoption of either conservation or no till practices (ConservationTillage) will be positive indicators of adoption. This BMP practice can be a 'win-win' by increasing soil productivity and decreasing time in the field (Knowler and Bradshaw 2007). Similarly, adoption of filter/riparian buffer strips is also expected to have a positive influence as a proxy for environmental awareness. For farmers using manure, a decrease in NUE adoption is predicted since 92% of corn acres from 2001 to 2010 that used manure did not meet rate, timing, and method criteria for USDA's good nitrogen management (Ribaudo et al. 2012). Nitrogen transformation inhibitors can be added to manure to reduce the loss of nitrogen via volatilization, as recommended by the NRCS nutrient management conservation practice standard (NRCS 2012). Two practices additional practices expected to coincide with adoption of NHibs and controlled-release fertilizers are irrigation and fall fertilizer application. Irrigation creates a heightened need for nitrogen preservation after application-therefore nitrogen inhibitor/control-release fertilizer can be beneficial (Halvorson et al. 2010;Chen et al. 2008). Fall nitrogen application can also benefit from a slowed fertilizer release since it is applied well before planting season (Schwab and Murdock 2010). In order to reduce externalities from agriculture, the federal government has developed conservation programs that subsidize farmers to adopt environmentally friendly practices like the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) (Ribaudo et al. 2011). We expect participation in federal and state programs to increase the likelihood of adoption of these practices, captured in the binary variable ConservationPayments. There may also be state or local regulations that require decreased N applications in some areas which would also increase adoption. This can occur in particular watersheds like the Chesapeake Bay and is represented by a binary variable called Nreq. Technology-related independent variables can be indicators of willingness to adopt other technologies (Knowler and Bradshaw 2007). Included in this model are technologies with a range of cost and sophistication. Variable rate application of nitrogen can adjust application rates across a field. This technology can be expensive and benefit from economies of scale, but when used increases NUE in the farm system (Khanna 2001  This results and discussion chapter begins with summary statistics along with charts that depict both variable attributes and relations. Then CART models are analyzed in an effort to segment farmers and find potential \"bundles\" of technologies and practices those surveyed may be using. Finally, multivariate regression results will be discussed in-depth.  (Ribaudo et al. 2011). In certain areas of the country it is difficult to get fertilizer on the field in the spring due to late winters and wet springs. Fall fertilizer application is done by some farmers in these growing conditions. Approximately 19% of those surveyed applied 40% or more of their nitrogen fertilizer in the fall."}, {"section_title": "Summary Statistics", "text": "The four technology variables were adopted at different levels. Variable rate fertilizer was only used by 121 farmers out of 1840 (7%). However, farmers applying pretreated seed was widely adopted (50%). The two field mapping variables, GPS soil maps and remote sensing, were used by 11% and 6% respectively. Overall the summary statistics help to give a snapshot of agricultural practices across the nation in 2010.  It was also the only information source that was related to higher adoption of plant tissue testing than nitrogen transformation inhibitors.  Table 5 shows a list of farm practices on the top and those same farm practices in the same order along the side. This is in a similar format to a correlation matrix. The grey boxes on the diagonal represent the number of farmers using that technology (e.g. 383 N soil test adopters adopted N soil testing). The remaining cells in the column represent the number of farmers that adopted the technology and also adopted another technology in the data (47 of those 383 N soil test adopters also used a nitrogen transformation inhibitor). Table 6 on the next page shows percentage of adoption, with the grey diagonal boxes being 58 100% and the remaining cells in each column representing a percentage of those adopting the technology in the column heading also adopting the technology in the row heading. The three most common practices are no till and/or conservation tillage (974), manure use as fertilizer (664), and fall fertilizer application (358). Particularly for our three dependent variables, no till/conservation till was widely adopted with 77% of plant tissue testers using this practice. N soil testing was commonly adopted by farmers that irrigated fields (53%). In table 5, 77 farmers indicated they had a reduced N requirement, all used manure as fertilizer (100%). In the estimated correlation matrix these two variables are positively correlated at the 0.6 level (anything above a 0.5 is problematic). Also every farmer that applied more than 40% of his crop fertilizer in the fall used manure (100%). Again these variables were positively correlated. If you look at these two statistics in reverse, of the 664 manure users 54% applied fertilizer in the fall and only 12% claimed they had a reduced nitrogen requirement. Ribaudo et al. (2012) found that most farmers using manure produced it in their farming operation. Farmers applying manure in the fall could possibly be both for fertilizing for spring crops and getting rid of excess manure due to limited storage. For this reason manure will be removed from the multivariate probit regression. Two variables related to water quality are conservation/no tillage and riparian filter or grass buffer strips. Riparian filter strips or grass buffers help to capture nitrogen runoff, as well as other nutrients, before it can enter a water system. Both conservation and no till help prevent soil erosion and increase organic matter, preventing rapid leaching and N loss via runoff. Roughly half the farmers that had filter or buffer strips (54%) also did conservation/no till. But only 15% of farmers doing conservation/no till had filter or buffer strips on the edges of their field. Tables 7 and 8 give technology counts and percentage of adoption by farmers from the survey. The first three technologies are the three NUE dependent variables. Several farmers adopted more than one of these technologies, indicating that a multivariate regression may be useful. Looking at the percentage table, notice that 64% of plant tissue testers did a nitrogen soil test compared to only 25% of N transformation inhibitor users. Pretreated seed was widely adopted by many of the 1840 farmers surveyed. Two variables with under 125 adopters in the survey are variable rate technology for fertilizer application and remote sensing. A third of these high tech users also did an N soil test (33-31%). But out of the same group only 10% and 7% respectively, used plant tissue testing. Overall, technology adoption for three of the four variables was fairly low compared to non-adopters.   Tables 3 through 8 show co-adopted technologies and practices U.S. corn farmers were using in 2010. These tables also give insight into the three dependent variables and the farmers who did and did not adopt them. These summary statistics and cross-tabs are valuable in establishing a baseline for the large farmer survey but are also a useful reference when analyzing CART models and regressions post hoc."}, {"section_title": "CART Models", "text": "The CART decision tree can be read starting at the target variable.

The dependent or target variable is at the top of the chart at Node 0. Inside Node 0, the 0 represents non-adopters and 1 represents adopters. A number is directly across from the 0 or 1 which indicates the number of observations in the survey that adopted or did not adopt. The key to not getting lost in the child node numbers is to remember that the 1's in the box indicate the number of farmers in a subgroup based on the dependent variable. The 0's indicate those farmers that did not adopt the dependent variable but still follow the splitting criteria. In each node these 1's and 0's help the researcher determine if meaningful or distinct splits are being obtained. One can now trace out farmer segments. For example, look in node 8 in Figure 9 and follow it up the tree; 38 of the 383 that used nitrogen soil testing had consultant recommendations, lived in the Midwest Region, and did not irrigate their fields. Below are the CART models for nitrogen soil testing, nitrogen transformation inhibitors, and plant tissue testing. The model summary indicates the variables the model could select to grow the decision tree. Tables 10, 12, and 14 display the statistics for the adjacent model.

The first split is on field irrigation, where 75 N soil test adopters irrigated making up 53.2% of all irrigators in the n=1840 survey. Of the 75, 39 farmers received a nitrogen recommendation from a consultant as seen in node 6. In comparison, a majority (53 of 66) of non-adopters of N soil testing farmers that irrigated their field did not get a consultant recommendation. From the left, non-irrigating farmers in node 1 split by Midwest region are in nodes 3 and 4. Both these nodes split into terminal child nodes (7, 8, 9, and 10) by consultant recommendation with the majority in both terminal splits being farmers that did not receive a consultant recommendation. Not every decision tree will reveal valuable information. In this case however, farmers surveyed that did N soil testing fell into two distinct groups; irrigators (308) and non-irrigators (75). Farmers that irrigated were likely (52%) to have used a consultant recommendation. So of all the farmers in the dataset that both irrigated and used a consultant for N recommendation, 75% also performed a nitrogen soil test (node 6).This 39 person sub-group could be considered \"irrigating N soil testing consultant-using\" farmers.    This model splits first into two groups; those who received N recommendations and those who did not. From the right, we see that a majority (110 of 189) of our nitrogen transformation inhibitor adopters received some kind of nitrogen recommendation from one of four sources. In node 2, 731 total farmers received nitrogen recommendations from our four sources-15% of which were nitrogen transformation inhibitor adopters. Node 2 then splits by Midwest region where 84 of the 110 farmers are from. Also interesting to note, looking at the totals in node 2 and 5-731 farmers in the survey said they received N recommendations from one of our 4 sources, 450 of which were from the Midwest region. So farmers from the Midwest region made up 58% of our survey (shown in summary statistics table 2) and 62% of those receiving N recommendations. From the CART model 67 one can infer that a sub-group of nitrogen transformation inhibitors are \"Midwestern N recommendation-seeking\" farmers.    "}, {"section_title": "CART Model Conclusions", "text": "To recap, a CART model will \"recursively partition to find increasingly homogeneous subsets based on independent variable splitting criteria using variance minimizing algorithms\" (Zheng et al. 2009:101). In all three CART models there was a different variable for the initial split from node 0; N soil testing and irrigation, N transformation inhibitors and no N recommendation sources, plant tissue testing and remote sensing. These models then broke into three levels with 7-13 nodes.  "}, {"section_title": "Multivariate Probit Regression Analysis", "text": "Now that summary statistics and CART models have been examined, multivariate probit regression results will be analyzed. These results are found in table 16. This type of regression is common in adoption studies and should reveal reliable indicators for adoption of the NUE dependent variables. The beta coefficients for each independent variable should not be interpreted the same as a standard regression. For this model the coefficient values measure the conditional probability changes in adoption given the level of the independent variables, holding all other variables constant. Refer to table 1 to note the base categories for the categorical variables. The intercept includes the base categories for the variables. The discussion will focus on the significance of the variable in the regression and its positive or negative relationship to the probability of adoption."}, {"section_title": "Regression Results", "text": "In the adoption literature, it has been found that in some cases, technologies are adopted as part of a package, i.e. that adoption of some practices are correlated. The null hypothesis for this regression is that the three dependent variables are uncorrelated. Table   15 shows \u03c1 estimates for adoption using a multivariate probit approach. The estimated correlation coefficient parameters show that the null hypothesis is rejected at the 1% level for plant tissue and nitrogen soil testing and at the 5% level for plant tissue testing and nitrogen inhibitors-jus tifying the use of a multivariate probit regression. We fail to reject the null hypothesis that \u03c1 is zero for nitrogen soil testing and nitrogen inhibitor use. This supports the finding from the summary statistics that those who adopt plant tissue testing have also adopted a range of other practices. For the two significant cases, a positive value for \u03c1 indicates that factors outside of the model that influence the adoption of nitrogen soil testing increase the likelihood of adopting plant tissue testing-likewise factors influencing the adoption of plant tissue testing also increase the likelihood of adopting nitrogen inhibitors or controlled-release fertilizers. Given the wide variety of explanatory variables in the model, we examined correlation coefficients for pairs of variables as well as testing for multicollinearity in the regressions as a whole. The absolute values of the correlation coefficients were all less than 0.4 once manure was removed. The individual regressions found no multicollinearity problems using variance inflation factor (VIF). The VIF for all variables in the model was less than 2.7 while a VIF of 10 or greater indicates that a variable may be deemed a linear combination of other independent variables in the model (Chen et al. 2003). For models with categorical dependent variables, the traditional ordinary least squares measure of fit, R 2 , cannot be used. In addition, the regressions have categorical independent variables so the appropriate measure is the max-rescaled R 2 value, a likelihood-based measure that is calculated by SAS (Stokes and Davis 2009) . The measure ranges from 0 to 1 with higher values indicating better fit. Max-rescaled R 2 values for the The second variable category is location and farm size. Natural log of acres is a proxy for farm operation size and economies of scale. For nitrogen inhibitors ln(acres) was positive and significant at the 1% level. None of the coefficients for expected yield per acre were significant. The regression contained 4 regions with Midwest as the base. Warmer regions like the Plains, South, and West were negatively correlated with adoption of nitrogen inhibitors. This result aligns with the use of nitrogen inhibitors in colder climates (Chen et al. 2008). Nitrogen soil testing showed the four regions in the regression were positive and significant at either the 1% or 5% level compared to the Midwest. Plant tissue testing did not have any significant regional coefficients, ceteris paribus. A possible indicator for likelihood of adoption can be adoption of previous innovations, both technologies and practices. Farmers' receipt of some type of state or federal money for conservation was positively associated with adoption of both nitrogen soil testing (p<5%) and plant tissue testing (p<1%). No NRCS funding is available for nitrogen transformation inhibitors so it is not surprising that conservation funding was not associated with adoption of this practice. This increased likelihood of adoption shows that conservation payments encourage soil and plant testing, as expected. This was also the case with conservation tillage/no till which was positively associated with plant tis sue testing (p<10%) and nitrogen transformation inhibitors (p<1%). These results indicate that farmers who are interested in conservation and improving environmental quality are more likely to adopt these specific NUE practices. However, filter or riparian buffer strips, reduced nitrogen requirement, and fall fertilizer application were all insignificant in predicting likelihood of adoption, ceteris 78 paribus. The non-significant results for the latter two variables are cause for concern since the potential for negative environmental impacts is heightened. Irrigation has a positive effect on N soil testing and nitrogen inhibitors at the 1% and 5% level of significance respectively. Farmers that use irrigation tend to have a high investment tied to field productivity and are concerned with N retention in soils (Robertson and Vitousek 2009), and this is reinforced in the regression results. Four technologies were chosen as explanatory variables in the model, again acting as a proxy for farmer innovativeness. The use of variable rate fertilizer, a capital intensive technology, showed a positive effect on adoption of nitrogen inhibitors (p<5%). The use of pretreated seed with insecticide, fungicide, and/or nematode coating was also positively associated with nitrogen inhibitor adoption (p<1%). Both NHibs and pretreated seed are additives to traditional farm inputs. The utilization of GPS soil maps was positively associated with adoption of nitrogen soil testing at the 1% level. This means that managers with GPS soil mapping may overlay recent nitrogen soil testing data. Finally remote sensing technology increased the likelihood of adoption for plant tissue testing and nitrogen inhibitors at the 5% level. This significance shows an added concern for timing-appropriate nitrogen by farmers using this technology. The multivariate probit analysis indicates that adoption of nitrogen soil testing is positively correlated with adoption of plant tissue testing and adoption of plant tissue testing was positively correlated with nitrogen inhibitor or controlled-release fertilizer use. As expected, older farmers were less likely to adopt the NUE eco-innovations (if the effect was significant). All three practices were les s likely to be adopted by farmers receiving no nitrogen fertilizer recommendations compared to recommendations from a consultant. This result indicates decreased likelihood of NUE adoption for those farmers not actively seeking input on nitrogen management. For the nitrogen soil testing model, all four regions were positive and significant, indicating that those regions were more likely than the Midwest, all else equal, to use this practice. Receipt of conservation payments was positive for both nitrogen soil testing and plant tissue testing, which follows the NRCS suggestions for conservation practices. This, along with indication of increased NUE practice adoption by those using conservation tillage implies that environmental concerns may be a driver for adoption of these win-win practices, although there was no significant effect of having filter/riparian buffers. Nitrogen inhibitors and controlled-release fertilizers showed a strong connection to current technology implementation, with 3 of the 4 innovations being positively associated with adoption. This adoption model helped to reveal influential variables for three NUE dependent variables, contributing to the previous body of research reviewed in chapters 3 and 4. These findings reinforce the predictability of certain factors like age and information, as well as the complexity of the adoption process and researchers' lack of understanding of all influential factors affecting farmer adoption of eco-innovations. The regression results also revealed that there are still many factors outside the model that are influencing adoption. This research study will be further discussed in the following chapter along with concluding remarks and potential future research."}, {"section_title": "Chapter 6 -Conclusions", "text": "The main source of nitrogen non-point source pollution in the environment is caused by agriculture (Ribaudo et al. 2011). Further adoption of NUE innovations is important for U.S. water quality and increased sustainability of agriculture (Pretty 2008;Ribaudo et al. 2012). Information about the multidimensional factors associated with the adoption of NUE innovations can help shape policy design and tailor outreach by both private and government entities. In analyzing the 2010 USDA ARMS data, this researcher tried to look at summary statistics, CART models, and multivariate probit regression results to understand drivers of adoption for three NUE innovations. Technology or practice variables like no till/conservation till and pretreated seed were widely adopted by participants evaluated in the survey. Both co-adopted table 5 and 7 indicated technologies and practices that were commonly (or uncommonly) adopted together. The three CART models revealed three different initial variable splits for our three dependent variables; N soil testing and irrigation, N transformation inhibitors and no N recommendation sources, plant tissue testing and remote sensing. This segment information means that extension agents and consultants could target farmers that irrigate that are not using N soil testing with information on its benefits, possibly getting a move receptive audience to NUE literature than non-irrigating farmers. For farmers that are receiving information from one of the four studied sources, they may also be receptive to using a nitrogen transformation inhibitor given many current Nhib users are active information-seekers. Fertilizer dealers may be interested in this technology since, while it may reduce N applications, sales of the inhibitors are a source of revenue. This also means that consultants, extension agents, contractors, and fertilizer dealers could be a potential survey source for understanding how to better increase NUE innovation adoption in the US. with the finding that adoption of plant tissue testing was related to both of the other NUE technologies, it seems that farmers who adopt this technology are in general very innovative farmers. They may thus fit the general category of \"innovators\" as described by Rogers (2003). This study used 2010 ARMS data from the USDA, which gives an in-depth, national representation of corn farmers and their financial and field management practices. The sample was large enough (n=1840) to help validate our multivariate probit regression results. This dataset is reviewed by USDA workers and policy developers as an indicator of current farm life-which adds to both the legitimacy and applicability of the outcomes. However, there are few variables in the survey relating directly to environmental attitudes and behavioral motives. The absence of this type of information can be a weak point when analyzing farmer behavior (Prokopy et al. 2008). This was a weakness in the regression analysis and was one of the likely reasons for overall low statistical significance in the regression model. Another weakness in this study was the lack of spatial details relating to geographic location and soil type. Though regional dummies and irrigation were used, this did not appropriately substitute for field fertility and soil drainage and may thus relate to the low explanatory power of the model. A better proxy would have been to use soil classification type of the surveyed field and possibly more specific locations like state. Future studies should consider adding a soil type dummy that can help to incorporate geospatial information that allows for incorporation of agroecological attributes . According to NRCS, not applying nitrogen fertilizer in the fall for spring crops is part of good nitrogen management (NRCS 2012). Fall nitrogen application was insignificant in all three regressions and did not appear in the CART models. This is concerning since fall nitrogen application already decreases NUE and increases possibility of N loss to waterways (Ribaudo et al. 2012). Further research needs to be conducted on farmers that are applying fertilizer in the fall. This also needs to include manure users, all of which applied fall fertilizer in our survey sample. Policy in Europe bans spreading of manure and fertilizer in late fall and winter (van Grinsven et al. 2012). Some states like Wisconsin prohibit applying fertilizer on frozen ground (Vanegreen 2014). But federal policy might be a possible solution in the US if farmers applying fall fertilizer are not following other best management practices and putting water quality at risk. Previous literature has found mixed results when analyzing predictors of agricultural eco-innovation adoption (Knowler and Bradshaw 2007;Prokopy et al. 2008). In this study, we examined four categories of independent variables to try and capture a breadth of possible influential factors. The results revealed that some predictors like information sources and age are associated with NUE innovation adoption. But there are still many factors outside the model which are driving the decision to use these three innovations. For example, lack of precise geospatial dummies and personality characteristics such as innovativeness may have played a role in the low R 2 values observed in this study.    What month prior to planting for the 2010 crop did you contract for the fertilizer used on this field? [Enter code \"1\" for January,\"2\" for February,etc.] "}]
