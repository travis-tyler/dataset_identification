This paper deals with the problem of exploiting both data, in a combined way, to develop a tool able to support clinicians in the study and diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). In this work, 69 subjects from the ADNI open database, 33 AD patients and 36 healthy controls, were analyzed. The possible existence of a relationship between brain structure modifications and altered functions between patients and healthy controls was investigated performing a correlation analysis on brain volume, calculated from the MRI image, the clustering coefficient, derived from fRMI acquisitions, and the Mini Mental Score Examination (MMSE). A statistically-significant correlation was found only in four ROIs after Bonferroni's correction. The correlation analysis alone was still not sufficient to provide a reliable and powerful clinical tool in AD diagnosis however. Therefore, a machine learning strategy was studied by training a set of support vector machine classifiers comparing different features. The use of a unimodal approach led to unsatisfactory results, whereas the multimodal approach, i.e., the synergistic combination of MRI, fMRI, and MMSE features, resulted in an accuracy of 95.65%, a specificity of 97.22%, and a sensibility of 93.93%."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) of the brain are popular methods of inquiry in neuroscience [1] . These techniques are exploited to obtain important morphological and functional information in a non-invasive way [2] . MRI can probe the structural environment, whilst fMRI can be employed to detect changes in the Blood Oxygenation Level-Dependent (BOLD) signal [3] . One of the most important limitations in MRI is the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) [3] , which is influenced by the static magnetic field B 0 and other parameters, e.g., time echo, time repetition, flip angle, slice thickness, and matrix size [4] . The adjustment of the cited parameters provides a good image reconstruction with a high SNR. The imaging modalities, such as computed tomography and MRI, ensure good tissue contrast and spatial resolution [2, 5] , which favor an adequate tissue segmentation. In fact, the possibility of detecting structural abnormalities depends on the segmentation accuracy, which in turn may improve the diseases' diagnosis [6] [7] [8] .\nThe segmentation can be performed manually or automatically with open source brain imaging software, e.g., SPM (fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk), FSL (fmrib.ox.ac.uk), or FreeSurfer (surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu). By means of these software programs, it is possible to recognize and to extract the data of the brain clinical information about AD diagnosis. Moreover, for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, we evaluated the possibility of correlating the GMV with the CC.\nFinally, the measurements from three data, i.e., MRI, fMRI, and MMSE, were combined to discriminate between AD and HC, through a Support Vector Machine (SVM). The findings presented in this work demonstrate that, instead of exploiting one type of measurement, using the combined and synergistic information from different imaging techniques (i.e., fMRI and MRI) and the clinical data from MMSE enhanced the AD classification, with an accuracy of 95.65%, a sensitivity of 93.93%, and a specificity of 97.22%. In fact, with a unimodal classification method, it is possible to obtain an accuracy of 62.32%, a sensitivity of 66.66%, and a specificity of 58.33% for fMRI; and an accuracy of 50.72%, a sensitivity of 30%, and a specificity of 69.44% for MRI."}, {"section_title": "Methods and Procedure", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "text": "The need to extract biological information from intact biological systems using MRI and fMRI introduced new technologies that allowed the study of human brain activity with greater detail and resolution [32] . MRI offers more tissue contrast possibility than other radiological methodologies, such as computerized tomography. This is possible by properly setting the time in which the Radiofrequency (RF) impulsive excitement is produced and its derived signal is registered. The contrast helps in discriminating different biological tissues and structures. However, it depends on both the longitudinal relax time (T 1 ) and transversal relax time (T * 2 ) [32] (T 1 is the time necessary to recover 63% of the longitudinal magnetization present before the RF impulse [4, 32] ).\nIn MRI, high T 1 is necessary to distinguish white matter, gray matter, and cerebrospinal liquid. T 2 is the time required for the transversal magnetization vector to decrease at 37% of the maximum of its intensity [4] . In MRI, low T 2 are necessary to distinguish the three above-cited cerebral tissues [4] . As a matter of fact, to perform studies on AD using MRI images, data acquired with high T 1 and low T 2 are necessary [4] . With these settings, the structural features can be adequately evaluated [4, 32] .\nThe MRI possibilities are often limited by the achievable SNR and the Contrast-to-Noise Ratio (CNR). Both the SNR and CNR have been shown to increase with the static magnetic field strength B 0 [32] . Besides the influence of the magnetic field B 0 , the SNR is affected by other parameters, such as Time Echo (TE), Time Repetition (TR), Flip Angle (FA), slice thickness, and matrix size [4, 32] . The work of Coriasco et al. [4] contained further details about these parameters and their influence on SNR. The intensity of the magnetic resonance signal is defined by the tissue volume. Indeed, high tissue volumes produce an intense MR signal, which in turn increases the SNR. However, this MRI measurement involves the so-called partial volume effect, which consequently lowers the image resolution levels [33] . This is a relevant aspects in the elaboration of MRI images. In fact, the poorer SNR of thin slices can be compensated to some extent by increasing the number of acquisitions or by a longer TR [34] . Considering the work of Pohmann et al. [35] , the SNR strictly depends on T 1 , T * 2 , TR, TE, FA, and the sensitivity of the receiver coil.\nSince this work made use of morphological data arising from MRI, the influence of all the cited parameters [4, 32, 35] was critically considered when patients and images to analyze were selected."}, {"section_title": "Magnetic Mechanism of the BOLD Signal", "text": "The BOLD signal represents the hemodynamic response of cerebral activation [36] . Several studies demonstrated that BOLD signal alterations represent a complex interplay between changes in the metabolic rate of cerebral blood volume, blood flow, and oxygen consumption rate [1, 36] . In fact, the increased neuronal activity induces modifications in local vasculature and thus causes changes in the deoxyhemoglobin (dHB) concentration [36] .\nThe dHB and the oxyhemoglobin present paramagnetic and diamagnetic behavior, respectively, leading to a shift of the local magnetic susceptibility [1] . In MRI, the material magnetization is directly proportional to the strength of the magnetic field [4] ; hence, different magnetic responses provoke different signals in MRI. Logothetis [3] demonstrated that the dHB induces field inhomogeneity and neural activity, resulting in BOLD signal reduction.\nThe importance of the temporal preprocessing step for the BOLD signal was underlined in [37] . In our study, preprocessing steps are implemented using the CONNtoolbox. This allows specifying possible temporal confounding factors, such as movement parameters and artifacts, and BOLD signals obtained from noisy ROIs, such as White Matter (WM) and Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF). Each temporal confounding factor c n (t) is then regressed from the BOLD signal, called BOLD(v, t), at each voxel as follows [37] :\nwhere BOLD * (v, t) is the observed bold signal at voxel v and time t, while N is the number of temporal confounds, and d k (t) are confound s from K noise ROIs, each characterized by M k components of the magnetization signal from each noise ROI. The resulting residual BOLD signals are band-pass filtered (0.001 Hz-0.01 Hz). Mathematical details are shown in Whitfield-Gabrieli et al. [37] ."}, {"section_title": "Data Acquisition and Preprocessing", "text": "All subjects used in this study were selected from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Data were selected based on the availability of the resting-state fMRI dataset for age-matched healthy normal subjects and AD patients. A total of 69 subjects, 33 Alzheimer's disease (18 29) , of the ADNI-2 database were considered. For each subject, only one acquisition was employed. The first acquisition of each subject was used, resulting in a total of 69 acquisitions. Subjects' demographic data are summarized in Table 1 .\nThis database includes more subjects (around one thousand). However, not every subject presents both morphological and functional images. Furthermore, some patients in the database may be initially classified as AD (or HC), and then, their clinical status is changed. Those patients were excluded from our study, i.e., we employed subjects that did not change their ADNI classification. Moreover, a subject can present more MRI and/or fMRI acquisitions taken at different time steps. The data used in this study were the only that presented contemporary anatomical MRI, functional MRI, and MMSE for each acquisition in the ADNI database. The MMSE feature was employed in this study because it is an accurate indicator of the clinical status and since it is widely used in clinical practice and largely available for most of the subjects included in the ADNI database. Not all subjects from the ADNI database presented the NPI-Q and/or the CDR indexes [29, 30] . Additionally, as regards the Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) subjects contained in the database, it should be noted that they present only anatomical MRI or fMRI data, and for this reason, we did not include them in our study. Moreover, in this work, images acquired with the same machine model and sequences were used to avoid problems caused from using different apparatuses and to overcame bias, as well as other problems due to different acquisition methods [4, 32, 35] .\nA major claim related to the number of subjects used in this study (i.e., 69) could be that the dataset dimension is not sufficient for both statistical analysis and the employment of a supervised approach for patients' classification. However, from the current available literature, studies such as [23, 38] have used a number of subjects between 19 and 28 to investigate the differences between AD patients and healthy subjects. Therefore, the use of a dataset 2.5-times larger should be regarded as an added value. On the other hand, studies make use of a spread and wide dataset (max. six hundreds patients) to perform statistical analysis, investigate the pathology using the graph theory or rely on automatic classification algorithms [26, 39, 40] , and have employed a single imaging technique [41, 42] , i.e., or MRI or fMRI or PET were used, but never combined together. Moreover, many of them specify the conditions used for all subjects, which would surely be different, thus probably leading to a bias in their results. Our paper has the aim of establishing the effectiveness of analyzing morphological, functional, and clinical features in AD subjects in a synergistic way using a reliable dataset.\nResting state data and structural MRI scans were acquired with a 3.0 T Philips Medical System scanner. The acquisitions were performed by ADNI according to its acquisition protocol [26] . The MRI data included high-resolution T 1 -weighted scans and an 8-channel receive-only head coil. The parameters included: sagittal plane, slices = 170, TR = 6.77 ms, TE = 3.13 ms, TI= 0 ms, FA = 9 \u2022 , matrix = 256 \u00d7 256, and voxel size = 1.0 \u00d7 1.0 \u00d7 1.2 mm 3 . All the resting state scans consisted of 140 functional volumes and were obtained while participants were resting in the scanner with eyes open. The parameters included: TR = 3000 ms, TE = 30 ms, flip angle = 80 \u2022 , slice thickness = 3.313 mm, and 48 slices. Resting state images and structural scans were elaborated in Nifty format [43] . The images were processed using the CONN functional connectivity toolbox v15.a (nitrc.org, Version 02142, Cambridge, MA, USA). This software exploits SPM routines to perform structural and functional analysis. The preprocessing procedures are summarized in Figure 1 . The first step was to realign the MRI structural data to undo the effects of subject movements during the scanning session. The differences between each successive scan and a reference scan, which is the average of all scans in the time series, was minimized [44] .\nAfterwards, the data were transformed using linear warps into a standard anatomical space, the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space [45] . A slice timing correction step was necessary to compensate for slice acquisition delays, which may add up to significant temporal shifts between the expected and the actually measured BOLD signal [46] . Finally, it was useful to co-register (to realign the 256 \u00d7 256 MRI images with the 64 \u00d7 64 fMRI images to work in a unique reference frame) functional and anatomical images [47] . We also included a scrubbing step for both motion artifacts and outliers in fMRI images. The Artifact Detection Tools (ART) software (nitrc.org) was used to identify scans affected by movement-related artifacts. Then, functional images were smoothed using a Gaussian kernel of 8 mm FWHM. The movements and the physiological noise were removed by linear regression. More precisely, the noise source considered was the signals from white matter and cerebrospinal fluid, the six head motion parameters, and the outlier scans detected during the scrubbing process [37] . Then, the preprocessed images were bandpass filtered to 0.001 Hz-0.01 Hz to reduce the noise. Figure 1 .

In MRI brain analysis, brain tissue should be classified into three tissue types, namely GM, WM, and CSF [48] . This distinction can be performed employing several different methods, e.g., manual segmentation, intensity-based methods, atlas-based methods, surface-based methods, and hybrid segmentation methods [48] . However, none of them is universally accepted in literature.\nTherefore, in this study, the SPM automatic intensity-based Gaussian segmentation was employed to recognize brain structures of interest and to use them for further analysis. In this method, each tissue class is modeled by a Gaussian distribution [48] and the histograms of brain MRI images have three main peaks corresponding to the three main tissue classes. These three peaks allow distinguishing the brain tissues and performing the correct operation of segmentation. This approach uses a \"modified Gaussian Mixture Model\" (GMM) [49] , which is a standard technique widely used by many tissue classification algorithms [50] . The main advantages of the standard GMM are the easy implementation and the small number of parameters that can be efficiently estimated [49, 50] ."}, {"section_title": "Brain Volume Calculation and Mask Construction", "text": "After the segmentation, the brain tissue images were used to quantify the whole brain volume and the intracranial volume. The whole brain volume was calculated as the sum of the volume of GM and WM; whereas the intracranial volume was calculated as the sum of GM, WM, and CSF.\nThe total brain volume was normalized for the whole intracranial volume to eliminate gender disparity [51] :\nIn fact, as can be seen in Figure 2a ,c, males and females presented different total brain volumes (p < 0.05). After normalization, such a difference fell, as shown in Figure 2b ,d (p > 0.05). These results strongly agreed with those found in [52] . Afterwards, employing the Wake Forest PickAtlas software (fmri.wfubmc.edu) [53] , the masks were limited to a priori Regions Of Interest (ROIs) through the AAL (Automated Anatomical Labeling) atlas [45] . This is one of the possible atlases to be used to extract masks, and it is often employed for studies involving Alzheimer's and MRI [54, 55] or fMRI [56] . This atlas includes 90 ROIs (45 per hemisphere). These masks were employed to quantify ROI volume and connectivity as in [54, 55] . The whole brain, intracranial, and ROIs volume were determined with the get_totals script (cs.ucl.ac.uk), such as in [57, 58] . This script takes one segmented MRI set, i.e., all the images for a given brain tissue, as input and then returns its volume expressed in mm 3 . Furthermore, to quantify ROI volume, the script takes the GM image and the ROI mask, and then, it calculates the intersection between these images, finally returning its volume in mm 3 . "}, {"section_title": "Connectivity Matrix and Network Measure", "text": "As stated in Section 2.2, the BOLD signals were extracted from fMRI images. Each signal was used to create connectivity matrices of 90 \u00d7 90, in which each row and each column stood for one ROI of the atlas. Each value in the matrices represented the functional connectivity. The functional connectivity is defined as the statistical dependencies among remote neurophysiological events [36, 59] , and it is measured with Pearson's correlation coefficient between two BOLD signals, mathematically [60] :\nwhere \u03c3 pq is the covariance of the two BOLD signals, and \u03c3 p and \u03c3 q are the standard deviations of the pth and qth signal, respectively. The connectivity matrices, shown in Figure 3 , were used to perform the network measure, i.e., the calculation of a clustering coefficient. Other studies [61, 62] demonstrated that this parameter is useful to discriminate the patient from the healthy control in Alzheimer's disease. Similarly to [61] , the clustering coefficient was used with another graph measure, path length, to evaluate the global organization of large-scale networks or the small world index and then evaluate the AD progression [63] . In our study, the clustering coefficient was used in combination with the relevant morphological brain feature to estimate the possible correlation between functional and morphological information in AD patients and to discriminate healthy controls from patients.\nThese matrices showed the mean functional connectivity in the AD group (Figure 3a) , in HC subjects (Figure 3b ), and the difference between the HC and AD groups (Figure 3c ). Figure 3c displays that there was a difference between the means of the correlation coefficients. This difference arose for several ROIs, but not for all of them. The CC of a vertex represents the likelihood that its neighbors are connected [64] . The clustering coefficient C i of a vertex i with degree k i is usually defined as the ratio of the number of existing edges (e i ) between the neighbors of i, and the maximum possible number of edges between the neighbors of i [16] :\nThis measurement was calculated with the Brain Connectivity Toolbox (BCT) (n-connectivity-toolboox.net)."}, {"section_title": "Statistical Analysis", "text": "All statistical analyses in this study were performed using the MATLAB Statistic Toolbox. In order to test if the normalized volume and GMV were significantly different among the HC and AD groups, a Mann-Whitney U-test was performed. When multiple comparisons are made between data, false positives ought to be thrown back through appropriate corrections, such as Bonferroni's correction [65] or the False Discovery Rate (FDR) [66] . In this analysis step, only Bonferroni's correction was performed because it is more conservative [28] . Finally, to test the correlation between MMSE and GMV and between CC and GMV, Spearman's correlation was employed."}, {"section_title": "Support Vector Machine Classifier", "text": "As discussed in the Introduction, to help the clinicians to investigate the AD status, the use of machine learning has been explored in the literature [27, 28] . Among the available supervised approaches, Support Vector Machine (SVM) is an efficient supervised learning method, which can organize large dimensional data classification [67] . This linear classifier is very efficient in working with two-class linearly-separable tasks, i.e., with data of the binary class [67] . The classification operates finding the hyperplane with the maximum possible margin between the two classes.\nThe capability and usefulness of the SVM classification method to discriminate AD patients from healthy ones was demonstrated in other studies [27, 28, 68] . However, it must be stressed that these works made use of structural brain features only, i.e., morphological information derived from MRI [68] . Even when a reduced number of feature is employed, this method should be regarded as a partial and limited approach to the development of a reliable diagnostic tool.\nIn contrast with other studies, which used different imaging modalities, such as FDG-PET [27] or investigated CSF [28] , the approach proposed in this paper exploits fMRI. In these studies [27, 28] , which presented both anatomical and another type of functional images, the number of subjects was comparable to the one used therein. In fact, in other studies that used MRI, such as [26, 39, 41] , subjects presented only morphological images. Another study used only fMRI acquisition, presenting 40 subjects, 20 ADs and 20 HCs [42] . All these considerations allowed us to say that our number of subjects was sufficient for this type of analysis. The approach proposed in our paper may be of interest for other researchers, which could access a larger dataset.\nTo train the SVM classifier, we used the leave-one-out method, as in [27, 42] . In this case, the analysis was repeated for each subject: in every iteration, one sample was left out to test the classifier, and the remaining subjects were fed to the classifier for training [69] . The procedure was repeated until all subjects were used at least once as the test sample. In this study, the SVM classifier was implemented in MATLAB.\nThree different SVM classifiers were tested. Firstly, the unimodal approach was assessed. Therefore, two different SVM systems were trained, one using the MRI measurements and the other one employing the fMRI-derived feature. Then, the MRI, fMRI, and MMSE information was combined to train a multimodal SVM classifier. The MMSE indicator was strongly correlated with the pathology and thus could favor the investigation between HC and AD subjects [29, 31, 70] ."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "The data used in this study were obtained from the ADNI open database, for a total of 69 acquisitions of AD and HC subjects. The goal of this paper was to compare AD patients with a group of HC to evaluate their morphological and functional differences, both through the correlation analysis and through the SVM classification.\nFirst, a Mann-Whitney U-test was performed to explore the statistical differences of the normalized whole brain volume between the AD patient group and the control group [71] . In Figure 4 , the results show that there was a significant difference between the two groups (p = 0.0011, z = \u22123.26). Moreover, AD patients presented a lower volume when compared with HCs. The findings from [5, 20] supported our results and suggested that AD is related to a lower brain volume with quantifiable differences with respect to the HC subjects. Furthermore, 36 ROIs presented a lower GMV (p < 0.05) in AD patients compared with HC. Even in this case, a Mann-Whitney U-test was performed. After Bonferroni's statistical correction, only two ROIs survived, the right rolandic operculum and the left superior temporal gyrus. Given the AAL atlas, some of the regions that did not survive after Bonferroni's correction (the discarded 34 ROIs) belonged to frontal lobe, as is reported in Table 2 , which is involved in cognitive function. Supposedly, these ROIs are affected by the pathology state [72] . Moreover, many of these regions were found in other structural studies that used the ADNI database, such as insula [38] , frontal cortex [38, 73] , posterior cingulate cortex [23, 73, 74] , hippocampus [73, 75] , fusiform [76] , temporal lobe [38, 73] , and, in particular, left middle temporal gyrus [45, 76] . These confirm and validate our results.\nAs performed in other studies [76, 77] , the possible correlation between GMV and the cognitive status, i.e., MMSE, across groups was studied. The AD patients had a MMSE score [78] of 12 \u00f7 28, whereas HC had an MMSE score of 24 \u00f7 30. This analysis step was necessary to evaluate if cognitive status was associated with structural status. Spearman's correlation coefficient was used [79] . Across groups, GMV was correlated to the MMSE score in 10 ROIs, as we can see in Table 3 , but after Bonferroni's correction, no one survived. Even in this small-sized database, AD patients were associated with lower values of MMSE, with respect to the HC subjects. The lower score of MMSE was associated with a lower GMV in the left superior temporal gyrus (\u03c1 = 0.3602, p = 0.0024), as shown in Figure 5 . This result shows that in AD subjects, the cognitive status was positively correlated with GM atrophy. Thus, for the atlas and the dataset analyzed in this study, this finding probably implies that a lower cognitive capacity is linked to a lower brain volume, which is the first consequence of pathology in AD [80] . Grey matter volume mm Successively, the correlation analysis between GMV and the clustering coefficient in the ROIs was assessed. This step was necessary to evaluate if any possible correlation between structural and functional information existed and can be exploited as a clinical feature to identify a possible difference between the HC and AD groups. The analysis was performed considering the two groups separated and then combining AD and HC subjects. This choice was aimed to identify if the correlation coefficient, \u03c1, can be statistically significant for a given ROI and to understand in which measure it can contribute to the knowledge of the differences between healthy control and diseased subjects, also when the two classes are grouped and mixed. In the literature, nobody has demonstrated this possible relationship using structural MRI and fMRI. Previous studies employed GMV as a covariate [23, 73, 74, 81] or evaluated the anatomical overlap between GM atrophy and functional disconnection [80] .\nOther techniques, such as diffusion MRI [24] , were used to evaluate such a probable correlation. In this work, across groups, the GMV and the CC were correlated in seven ROIs; after Bonferroni's correction, no ROI survived. From Figure 6a , higher GMV was associated with high CC in the right supplementary motor area (\u03c1 = 0.3107, p = 0.0096). Within the HC group, nine ROIs presented correlation between GMV and CC. Higher GMV was associated with a higher correlation coefficient in the left calcarine (rho = 0.4597, p = 0.0052), as shown in Figure 6b . Within the AD group, as observed from Figure 6c , only four ROIs presented a correlation between GMV and CC. Higher GMV was associated with a higher CC in the left hippocampus (\u03c1 = 0.4014, p = 0.0213). Other results of the correlation analysis are shown in Table 4 . The findings from Table 4 , considering the HC subjects, indicated that the correlation coefficient of GMV and CC of both the supplementary motor areas and the cuneus, the left calcarine, the middle-left occipital, and left angular were statistically significant. When looking at the \u03c1 between structural and functional information for these ROIs in the AD group, it can be noticed that they did not survive the Bonferroni correction. Indeed, for the AD set, the number of ROIs that presented a strong and significant correlation between CC and GMV was lower. They were middle-left frontal, frontal inferior right operculum, left hippocampus, and left Heschl. It can be inferred that considering a homogeneous group (or HC or AD), the correlation between some ROIs was significant, but the ROIs were not the same. This can be relevant information, since a positive correlation coefficient indicates that lower values of GMV are associated with lower CC values, implying that the pathology determines differences in structural and functional features. When AD and HC subjects were grouped, it can be observed, after Bonferroni's correction, that most of the ROIs with a statistically-significant correlation coefficient were areas that were not pointed out when analyzing the other groups (left precentral, left and right angular, left paracentral lobule, and right putamen). However, for both the left and right supplementary motor area and the left cuneus, significant results were found, as when the HC group was analyzed. It is evident that the GMV of these ROIs can be associated with a strong relationship with the CC in healthy subject, even for AD patients. Table 4 . Regions with significant correlation between Grey Matter Volume (GMV) and the Clustering Coefficient (CC) across and with AD and HC groups. The area that survived Bonferroni's correction is highlighted in bold font. Figures 5 and 6 show the ROIs having the biggest correlation coefficient for each analysis. We decided not to present all ROI graphics to allow a comprehensible reading. Moreover, in each graphic, the correlation line and the standard deviation are depicted. The reader should note that the correlation coefficient did not reach values higher than 0.75. However, in our case, Pearson's coefficient was influenced by several factors, such as the number of subjects and the clinical condition, i.e., the MMSE. In fact, the distribution of the correlation coefficient values fell within the range observable in other literature surveys [74] ."}, {"section_title": "ROI-Number and", "text": "Finally, the SVM classification was tested. Firstly, the performance of the unimodal classification method in the identification of AD from the healthy controls was tested, based on MRI or fMRI. Specifically, when using fMRI, a unimodal classification method, it was possible to achieve a classification accuracy of 62.32%, a sensitivity of 66.66%, and a specificity of 58.33%. On the other hand, when relying on MRI only, the classification of AD subjects from HC for the mono-modal method showed a classification accuracy of 50.72%, a sensitivity of 30%, and a specificity of 69.44%.\nAs a comparison with the previous two classification methods, the combined measurements of MRI, fMRI, and MMSE were used to train the SVM classifier. For each subject, the set of 90 features coming from MRI, GMV from 90 ROIs, 90 features derived from fMRI, clustering coefficient from 90 ROIs, and one feature from MMSE, was concatenated. As can be noticed from Table 5 and Figure 7 , the combination of MRI, fMRI, and MMSE measurements achieved a more accurate classification and discrimination between AD and HC. In this case, the method could achieve a classification accuracy of 95.65%, a sensitivity of 93.93%, and a specificity of 97.22%. While other studies [25, 82] applied the SVM unimodal classification method or exploited images obtained from different imaging techniques [27, 28] , our study implemented a multimodal classification from the MRI and fMRI method combined with MMSE. The results derived from training the SVM with MRI, fMRI, and MMSE data allowed us to infer that the approach proposed in this paper is valuable and can be of potential interest to clinicians and researchers. The presented method can be adapted to carry out a similar analysis to evaluate if differences between AD and MCI patients exist. To this aim, the use of the MMSE as additional information and the investigation of its relationship with MRI-and fMRI-derived data can support AD research."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "In this paper, morphological MRI and functional MRI images' processing was analyzed to verify the possibility of correlating anatomical and functional data for AD and HC subjects. First, we compared normalized whole brain volume between the HC group and AD group, which presented a lower value of this parameter. Furthermore, 36 ROIs exhibited a negative change of the GMV in AD patients compared with the HC ones. These regions are known to be involved in functions affected by the pathology progression [72, 83] . Furthermore, regarding the possible correlation between GMV and cognitive status, i.e., MMSE, within groups, we had positive correlation coefficients between GMV and MMSE in left superior temporal gyrus. Our results agree with a previous study [84] , where positive correlation between MMSE and a volumetric measure, i.e., volumes of deep GM, was reported. This demonstrates that pathology differences are strictly linked to a minor brain volume in AD patients and to physiological aging in HC. Successively, the potential association between GMV and CC in the ROIs was analyzed to correlate anatomical and functional results.\nIn fact, in the literature about AD research, to the best of our knowledge, nobody has demonstrated this promising relationship. The AD group showed a positive correlation in 4 ROIs, while in the HC group, there were nine ROIs correlated. This showed the relationship between morphological and functional data. On the other hand, this did not allow direct classification between the two groups, but only highlights a possible relationship between function and structure; hence the necessity to perform the SVM classification. In our study, we put in prominence the investigation of the differences between the AD group and HC, combining the structural, functional, and clinical features, through MRI, fMRI, and MMSE, respectively. Indeed, the unimodal classification methods, which use only one feature, showed poor accuracy and low values of sensitivity and specificity. Moreover, unlike other studies [27, 28] , we used the fMRI technique. The use of BOLD signals and derived measurements from fMRI allowed a less troublesome investigation since this approach does not employ radiative contrast agents or require the acquisition of liquid biological samples [27, 28] . Moreover, at the same time, it provides helpful information related to AD status. Moreover, while other studies [25, 82] used only MRI images, we proposed a multimodal method that combines MRI, fMRI, and MMSE with an increased accuracy.\nAdditional studies could provide further analysis and could confirm these findings. The brain volumes can be correlated with other metrics, which can be used to derive other features, e.g., the correlation of GM with path length measurements. This would further help to understand the link between structure and function in AD subjects. Instead, through the use of a classifier, it was possible to discriminate AD patients from healthy controls, and this could be a potential use in clinical applications.
