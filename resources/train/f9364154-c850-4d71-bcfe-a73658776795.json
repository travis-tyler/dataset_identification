[{"section_title": "", "text": "Field Procedures Manual\nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Office of Coast Survey April 2014\ni\n\n\fFOREWORD The purpose of this Field Procedures Manual (FPM) is to provide NOAA field units with consolidated and standardized guidelines and requirements for conducting, processing, and generating final field deliverables for Office of Coast Survey (OCS) hydrographic surveys. This manual summarizes current best practices that shall be used by NOAA field units to meet specifications set forth in the NOS Hydrographic Surveys Specifications and Deliverables. Words used in this manual to denote mandatory or permissive actions are defined as follows: \u00b7 \"Shall\" or \"must\" means the procedure or standard is mandatory. \u00b7 \"Should\" means the procedure or standard is recommended. \u00b7 \"May\" and \"need note\" means that the procedure or standard is optional. \u00b7 \"Will\" means futurity of action only and does not indicate any degree of requirement for application of a\nprocedure or meeting a standard. Due to the rapid development of technology and continual improvement of operational methods, the FPM will require periodic maintenance. User input, particularly from field units, is critical to ensuring that the FPM is up to date. Recommended changes to the FPM will be reviewed by committee bi-annually for potential application to the FPM. Any new procedures put into effect between versions of the FPM will be implemented via a Hydrographic Surveys Technical Directive. Recommended changes and other comments regarding the manual can be made via the following online form: https://docs.google.com/a/noaa.gov/spreadsheet/viewform?usp=drive_web&for mkey=dDZ1anFweXZiLUQtNXNMYWh2SktFdlE6MA#gid=0 or via email to HSSD.FPM.updates@noaa.gov. Any mention of a commercial company or product within this manual does not constitute an endorsement by NOAA. The use for publicity or advertising purposes of information concerning proprietary products or software or the tests of such products is not authorized.\nii\n\n\fSIGNIFICANT FPM CHANGES SINCE RELEASE

procedures to perform modern hydrographic surveys. Due to the variety of equipment and highly technological nature of operations, a consistent, well-documented program of systems preparation and maintenance is essential to ensure that NOAA's hydrographic field units are capable of producing data that will meet OCS specifications. These procedures can be broken down into two categories: Annual Systems Preparation and Periodic Quality Assurance.\n1.1 Annual Systems Preparation\nEach field unit shall schedule an adequate period of time for Annual Systems Preparation, typically during winter inport for ships, in which survey systems will undergo annual calibration, maintenance, and verification procedures as defined in this chapter. These procedures should also be performed following any significant period of inactivity and after major changes or upgrades to a field unit's hydrographic systems. Unless specifically stated otherwise or assistance is arranged from another NOAA office, Systems Preparation should be conducted and documented by field unit personnel.\nAs a final step in Annual Systems Preparation, prior to the start of survey data acquisition, each field unit shall perform a Hydrographic Systems Readiness Review as described in section 1.1.1. This process is simply a formal review of each hydrographic field unit's Annual Systems Preparation.\n1.1.1 Hydrographic Systems Readiness Review\nThe primary purpose of the Hydrographic Systems Readiness Review (HSRR) is to officially document and inform OCS senior-level management of a field unit's level of readiness to perform hydrographic surveys that will meet OCS specifications. This procedure also affords field units the opportunity to identify any deficiencies that will prevent optimal performance and production throughout the field season. These deficiencies may include such items as damaged or unreliable equipment, unmet training needs, and personnel shortages. Formally documenting field unit requirements will better prepare OCS to provide support and meet the needs of NOAA's hydrographic fleet. The Hydrographic Systems Readiness Review process can be broken down into four basic steps outlined below.\n1. Hydrographic Systems Review Team Organization. A Hydrographic Systems Review Team shall be organized for each NOAA hydrographic field unit. This team shall consist of an assigned OCS Representative, typically a hydrographer from either the Atlantic Hydrographic Branch (AHB) or the Pacific Hydrographic Branch (PHB), the regional Hydrographic Systems and Technology Program (HSTP) Field Support Liaison, and the field unit's Field Operations Officer (FOO) or equivalent.\n2. Hydrographic Systems Review. The Hydrographic Systems Review Team shall examine both physical survey systems and documentation for Annual Systems Preparation requirements outlined in this chapter. 1\n\n\fAfter completion of the review, this team shall brief the Chief-of-Party on the level of field unit readiness determined,any deficiencies identified, and any recommendations that could increase the unit's data quality or general survey efficiency.\n3. Hydrographic Systems Readiness Review Memo. Within ten working days of commencing survey operations, the Chief-of-Party shall notify OCS of the field unit's hydrographic systems status and level of readiness to complete its assigned OCS hydrographic survey mission. This notication shall be an email submission consisting of a digitally signed Hydrographic Systems Readiness Review Memo (see Appendix 1) that lists system deficiencies identified during the Hydrographic Systems Review and a plan to address each problem. Any modications or restrictions in operations that will be necessary in the interim must also be identified.This digitally signed memo should be sent to ocs.hsrr@noaa.gov. Files shall be named using the following format <UNITNAME_HSRR_MMDDYYYY.pdf>. For additional HSRR memos, add Adendum or Amendment <UNITNAME_HSRR_Adendum1_MMDDYYYY.pdf>. This digitally signed memo should be sent to ocs. hsrr@noaa.gov. The following people receive e-mail sent to ocs.hsrr@noaa.gov:\n(a) Chief and Deputy Chief, Hydrographic Surveys Division (HSD)\n(b) Chief and Deputy Chief, Navigation Services Division (NSD)\n(c) Chief, Hydrographic Systems and Technology Program (HSTP)\n(d) Chief, Atlantic Hydrographic Branch (AHB)\n(e) Chief, Pacific Hydrographic Branch (PHB)\n(f) Chief, HSD Operations Branch\n(g) Chief, NSD Navigation Response Branch (NRB)\n4. Hydrographic Systems Readiness Acknowledgment. Within ten working days of receiving the Hydrographic Systems Readiness Review Memo, the Chief of HSD or Chief of NSD shall formally acknowledge receipt via digital memorandum to the field unit's Chief-of-Party with a copy to ocs.hsrr@noaa.gov. This memorandum of acknowledgment shall also state OCS acceptance, qualified acceptance, or rejection of the field unit's hydrographic systems readiness. If systems readiness is partially accepted or rejected, the memorandum shall list any specific actions required by OCS for the field unit to meet data quality standards.\n1.2 Periodic Quality Assurance\nPeriodic Quality Assurance refers to any additional procedures required by OCS to maintain or verify continued data quality between annual Hydrographic Systems Reviews. These procedures vary by equipment type and are generally performed on a scheduled basis throughout a unit's field season. Specific requirements are organize by system type and defined in this chapter.\n1.3 Basic Methods and Documentation\nTo effectively manage a field unit's hydrographic systems, a comprehensive inventory must first be completed, and then continually maintained. A standard format for a Hydrographic Systems Inventory has been implemented\n2\n\n\fby OCS, as described in section 1.3.1 . OCS has further established a standardized hydrographic system database, HiBase, which may be utilized for recording this inventory as described in section 1.3.2. HiBase is intended to serve as a centralized database that retains and archives all vessels and hydrographic hardware and software used fleet-wide.\nThe Hydrographic Systems Inventory is a critical element of systems documentation for both Annual Systems Preparation and changes occurring throughout a unit's field season. Preparation and maintenance requirements will vary, typically by survey system category and type. While Periodic Quality Assurance procedures are relatively easy to manage, the sheer quantity and variety of tasks to be completed during AnnualSystems Preparation can be daunting. OCS-recommended methods for meeting both Annual Systems Preparation and Periodic Quality Assurance requirements for standard hydrographic survey systems are described in detail in sections 1.4 of this document. However, unless stated that the field unit shall or must follow a specific procedure, these methods are not mandatory. Field units are encouraged to develop more efficient and/or accurate methods in consultation with HSD and HSTP personnel. Note: Any new procedures used must be documented with sufficient detail for the process to be recreated. Systems documentation shall meet the minimum guidelines set forth in this chapter and use digital reporting formats supplied in Appendix 1. Each of the forms provided in Appendix 1 has been designed to include essential information. The bulk of systems documentation is to be maintained by the field unit and made available for review during Hydrographic Systems Reviews and at the request of OCS. Documentation designed for continual maintenance, such as the Hydrographic Systems Inventory spreadsheet, should be used to capture changes that occur throughout a field season.\n1.3.1 Hydrographic Systems Inventory\nEach field unit shall complete and maintain a digital Hydrographic Systems Inventory addressing the four systems categories described below. This information shall be recorded using the format provided below.\n\u00b7 Vessels - Include all vessels to be used for hydrographic data acquisition. For new vessels or platform types not commonly used in OCS hydrography, additional descriptive information with diagrams and/or picture should be included\n\u00b7 Hardware Systems - Include all hardware systems to be used to acquire hydrographic survey data.\n\u00b7 Software Systems - Include all software to be used to acquire or manipulate hydrographic survey data.\n\u00b7 Personnel Roster - Include all personnel within the field unit who will be actively involved in survey operations.\nAs this inventory will typically change over the course of the field season or surveying period, the Hydrographic Systems Inventory shall be updated as changes occur and submitted as Appendix I of the Data Acquisition and Processing Report (DAPR) for each project.\n1.3.2 HiBase (Hydrographic Inventory Database)\nField units may opt to use HiBase, a standardized hydrographic inventory database developed by the Coast Survey Development Laboratory (CSDL), for recording and maintaining their Vessel, Hardware Systems and Software Systems inventories per section 1.3.1 . Field personnel may register for a HiBase user account at https://hibase.noaa.gov.\n3\n\n\f1.4 Vessels\nVessels are the most fundamental systems in hydrography. Accurate measurement of the dimensions and dynamic parameters of these platforms is essential to obtain high quality survey data. Vessel \"calibration\" consists of measuring, and estimating error for, static parameters such as the physical positions of instruments and equipment on a vessel, as well as dynamic parameters such as waterline and dynamic draft. Measurement, verification, and documentation of static parameters are addressed in section 1.4.1 . Dynamic parameters are discussed in section 1.4.2 .\n1.4.1 Vessel Static Offsets\nStatic offsets of a vessel and its instrumentation are measured for the purpose of establishing a local referenceframe to which all soundings and positions will be tied. Thus, errors in these measurements will directly translate to errors in survey data acquired by that vessel. Because much of the equipment installed on vessels remains fixed from year to year, it may not be necessary to perform a full survey of every platform during Annual Systems Preparation.\nIf the results of a previous survey are available and well documented, and the vessel's configuration has not changed, simply verifying the existing values should be sufficient. Even when instrumentation has been moved, if the reference frame is based on a network of benchmarks independent of the movable equipment, it may be possible to reposition instruments within the fixed network rather than resurvey the entire vessel. This procedure will result in a significant savings of time and effort, but it is imperative that the original survey be completely and accurately documented to be effective.\nThe following items shall be positioned as part of any static offset survey conducted for a NOAA hydrographic survey platform:\n\u00b7 Permanent benchmarks - Benchmarks shall be sufficient in number and position to maintain the vessel reference frame if instrumentation is disturbed.\n\u00b7 Sonar transducers - All vertical beam echosounders, multibeam echosounders, and hull mounted side scan sonars that may be used to acquire hydrographic survey data shall be positioned. Transducers mounted on poles, levers, or other movable mounts should be surveyed in their fully deployed position. Offsets shall be measured to the transducer's phase center, or the origin of the sonar's local reference frame. OCS recommends also documenting measurements to a nearby permanent mounting point, for reference if the sonar head must be removed or replaced. Consult the corresponding manufacturer's documentation for further guidance on the location of transducer phase centers.\n\u00b7 GPS antennae - All survey system GPS antennas shall be positioned. This includes any GPS antennas that are integrated with differential beacon receivers and typically only used for differential corrections but could pote tially be used to acquire complete survey position data. Antennas capable of receiving differential correctors only do not need to be surveyed. Offsets shall be measured to the phase center of each antenna, a point which may be located inside the antenna's housing. Consult the corresponding manufacturer's documentation to determine the phase center location of a specific antenna type. OCS recommends also documenting measurements to the permanent mounting post for reference if the antenna must be removed or replaced.\n\u00b7 Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) - For all vessels equipped with a POS/MV system, measurements shall be made to the origin of the POS/MV IMU's local reference frame. The manufacturer's documentation will define the IMU's local reference frame and identify its origin. 4\n\n\f\u00b7 Reference Point (RP) - A RP shall be established and positioned for each vessel. This point will define the origin of the local vessel reference frame to which all survey data will be tied. Note: OCS strongly recommends that a vessel's RP be established at the vessel's approximate center of motion (as defined below) and coincident with the origin of the IMU's local reference frame on vessels equipped with a POS/MV system. By collocating these three points, the number of physical offset measurements required will be reduced, thus minimizing sources of error in position and attitude data.\n\u00b7 Center of Motion (CM) - A CM shall be defined and positioned for each vessel. Establish this point at an approximate location at which the vessel's roll, pitch, and yaw axes intersect during static conditions and average loading. The location of a vessel's true center of motion will vary based on a combination of hull shape, loading conditions, and vessel speed; thus it is a dynamic point. However, a fairly accurate estimation can be made using the vessel's plans and empirical observation. Field units should contact NOAA's Marine Engineering Division (MED) for assistance when defining a vessel's CM.\n\u00b7 Towpoint - If the vessel is equipped to perform towed sonar operations, the towpoint shall be positioned. The position of the towpoint is defined as the last point of contact between the tow cable and the vessel, typically the top of a sheave over which the tow cable is led. If the sonar is towed from a movable point (J-arm, A-frame, etc.), it shall be in its fully deployed position for this measurement.\n1.4.1.1 Vessel Measurement Requirements & Methods\nVessel measurement procedures vary depending on whether the intent is to complete a full survey of a vessel, conduct a partial survey to position new or disturbed instrumentation within an existing reference frame, or simply verify existing offsets when no known changes have occurred. The requirements and methods for each of these scenarios are described below.\n1.4.1.1.1 Full Survey\nA full survey of a hydrographic vessel is required when no prior survey exists or under any circumstances where all previous surveys are determined to be unusable. Full vessel surveys should be conducted by National Geodetic Survey (NGS) personnel or a professional geodetic surveyor. Full vessel surveys can be both time consuming and expensive; thus, proper documentation is important to preserve the value of this work.\nExamples of conditions that would require full surveys include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u00b7 A vessel is new or will be engaged in hydrography for the first time.\n\u00b7 Significant modifications have been made to the vessel since the last full survey.\n\u00b7 New equipment is installed or existing equipment is repositioned, and the items cannot be accurately referenced to benchmarks from a prior survey.\n\u00b7 New technology or techniques become available that would significantly increase the accuracy of offset measurements or error estimates for the vessel.\n\u00b7 Complete documentation of the previous survey, including offset values, error estimates, and procedure descriptions, is not available. 5\n\n\f\u00b7 The hydrographer discovers blunders or unexplained discrepancies when verifying the results of a previous offset survey. See section 1.4.1.1.3.\n\u00b7 The vessel is involved in an incident, such as a grounding, that has altered the positions of benchmarks and instrumentation, affecting the validity of the previous survey.The goal of a full survey is to establish a completely new three dimensional local vessel reference frame that is independent of any prior vessel surveys conducted. Information from existing surveys shall not be incorporatedinto any full survey.\nGeneral Considerations for Full Surveys\nAccuracy Requirements - OCS has not defined specific numerical values for required offset measurement accuracy. However, errors introduced in the offset measurement process will be combined with errors from other sources to produce a final Total Propagated Uncertainty (TPU) for each sounding. Measurement errors must be accurately estimated and small enough for vessel data to meet OCS survey specifications. More accurate vessel surveys will leave additional room in the error budget for other sources of error, which may allow the hydrographer to retain more data or operate under more adverse conditions than would be possible with a low accuracy survey. Note: Some integrated position and attitude sensors in use on NOAA platforms, such as the Applanix POS M/V, do have specific accuracy requirements for offset measurements between system components during installation. Hydrographers should review the manufacturer's documentation for any system-specific requirements.\nBenchmarks - Benchmarks are permanent, known positions on the vessel used to identify the established local reference frame. They may be either existing points, such as antenna posts or well defined features of the vessel, or monuments specifically created or installed for the purpose of the survey. Examples of monuments are punch marks, scribe marks, or survey disks. Hydrographers shall avoid establishing vessel reference frames that utilize impermanent features of the vessel as benchmarks. The following two factors should be considered when selecting or installing benchmarks: (1) Permanence - Benchmarks should be permanent features fixed to the vessel's hull or superstructure. Instruments are typically not appropriate benchmarks because of their potential to be moved. If points such as sensors, antennae, or transducers are used as benchmarks, the reference frame maybe invalidated if the equipment is removed, replaced, or relocated. (2) Accessibility and Location - Benchmarks should be established in locations that are protected, but can be readily accessed for future surveys. OCS strongly recommends establishing benchmarks near hydrographic instruments such as sonar heads and antennae. Doing so will allow sensors to be accurately reintegrated into the network if they are moved. Since these benchmarks are used to establish a three dimensional reference frame on the vessel, three benchmarks should be readily accessible from each instrument location to accurately position sensors, regardless of vessel attitude.\nSelection of a Reference Point - Every benchmark network must have a defined origin (i.e., a reference point) for the local reference frame. OCS recommends locating this point at the vessel's approximate center of motion during static conditions and average loading, as discussed in section 1.4.1 Error Estimation - Accurate error estimates for a vessel survey are as important as the offset measurements themselves. While specific sources of error are inherent to each method of survey (see Surveying Methods below), the following common factors affect the accuracy of all vessel offset surveys.\nSetups - This term refers to the number of individual measurements required to compute the relative position of two benchmarks, literally the number of times the surveyor's instruments must be set up to complete the measurement. Multiple setup measurements use intermediate points as temporary benchmarks between the two desired points. Physically positioning the measurement instrument on or over a benchmark or other reference point is a possible source of error, so multiple setups can increase the measurement error between two points. Hydrographers should attempt to minimize the number of setups required between benchmarks and record the number of setups for each leg of the survey.\n6\n\n\fRedundancy - If possible, the hydrographer should arrange the survey such that no benchmark is tied to the rest of the network by only one measurement. Ideally, each benchmark should be tied directly to multiple other benchmarks. In cases where vessel layout makes this impractical, multiple measurements along the same leg maybe useful. These additional data can be used to improve the accuracy of positions generated by the survey. While redundant positions can simply be averaged, a more accurate method of determining a final value is to combine measurements using a least squares algorithm.\nTotal Error - When estimating the total error for one leg of a vessel offset survey, individual measurement errors are combined using a \"root sum squared\" method, rather than simple addition. For example, in the case of a two setup measurement, the final error estimate for the leg would be computed as follows:\nwhere \u00f3 is the standard deviation of the total measurement, \u00f31 is the standard deviation of the measurement from the first benchmark to the temporary benchmark, and \u00f32 is the standard deviation of the measurement from the temporary benchmark to the second benchmark.\nVessel Leveling - Although it is possible to establish a vessel reference frame that is not aligned with the vessel itself, this adds an element of complication and potential error that is best avoided. The vessel surveying process is much simpler if the vessel is removed from the water and leveled relative to the earth. For ships, this may not be possible, but launches can generally be accommodated using trailers or jack stands. If a ship is to be surveyed during a dry dock period, measurements must be corrected for the slope of the vessel on the marine railway. This angle can be determined by referencing marine growth along the ship's waterline prior to pressure washing. Subsequent offset measurements will need to be corrected for the determined angle of inclination.\nSurveying Methods For the purposes of this manual, offset measurement techniques are broken into the following two categories:\n\"Traditional\" Methods - these methods refer to conducting a vessel offset survey using tools such as steel measuring tapes, T-squares, plumb bobs, and laser or carpenter's levels. While these instruments can yield very exact measurements, particularly on small vessels such as launches, this technique relies on the assumption that the vessel is level and true. With this method, the surveyor uses the existing planes and axes of the vessel's construction, such as the deck, door frames, and keel lines, to establish the local reference frame. Not only can significant error be introduced if the vessel is not actually level and true, it can also be more difficult to estimate error using traditional methods. OCS recommends using advanced survey methods if equipment and expertise are available.\n\"Advanced\" Methods - these methods employ precision survey equipment such as theodolites, laser range finders, total stations, and optical levels. One advantage of using these optical techniques is that measurements are independent of the vessel's attitude and alignment. Since the surveying instrument can be positioned anywhere convenient, measurements between benchmarks can often be accomplished with a single setup, thereby minimizing error. Detailed procedures for conducting vessel surveys using advanced methods have not been established by OCS. Field units desiring a full vessel survey using advanced methods should consult the regional HSTP Field Support Liaison before proceeding. Assistance using these techniques may also be available through the National Geodetic Survey (NGS) Geodetic Services Division.\n7\n\n\f1.4.1.1.2 Partial Survey\nA partial vessel survey shall be conducted if minor changes have been made to the vessel configuration, but the most recent full survey has not been rendered obsolete. Partial surveys are typically appropriate when equipment is removed and replaced or repositioned on a vessel without disturbing the network of permanent benchmarks. In such cases, the new position of the instrument can be determined by surveying its position relative to the undisturbed benchmarks. The original survey shall then be updated and would remain valid Partial surveys are significantly less time consuming than full surveys, but are only valid if benchmarks installed as part of the original survey remain undisturbed. When in doubt as to whether a new full survey is necessary or a partial survey is sufficient, field units shall complete a full survey of the vessel.\nPartial surveys are basically identical to full surveys, but on a much smaller scale. The same rules and considerations described for full surveys apply to partial surveys. Since measurements are typically made over short distances and require few setups (assuming benchmarks have been installed near instrumentation as recommended), good accuracy can often be achieved with traditional survey methods. However, advanced methods may provide a more accurate estimate for measurement error.\n1.4.1.1.3 Verification Survey\nVerification surveys are conducted to check the validity of pre-existing full (or combination of full and partial) surveys when no changes to the vessel's configuration have occurred. This is the minimum survey required as part of Annual Systems Preparation and, as such, shall be conducted at least annually. The purposes of a verification survey are to review the offsets, error estimates, and documentation of the prior survey, and to check for measurement blunders, vector algebra mistakes, sign errors, etc.\nVerification surveys can be viewed as a \"sanity check\" of the existing survey data and may be conducted using traditional methods. Typical procedures consist of pulling steel tape between benchmarks to verify the offset values and rechecking the vector algebra to confirm established values. Error estimates in the original documentation shall be reviewed for consistency and suitability for the vessel's current mission. Any discrepancies discovered during a verification survey may trigger a partial survey or a new full survey of the vessel.\n1.4.1.2 Periodic Quality Assurance Checks\nPeriodic quality assurance checks are simply Verification Surveys, or portions thereof, performed at the discretion of the field unit. This type of check would be used if the vessel was involved in an incident, such as a grounding, that might have altered the positions of benchmarks and instrumentation, affecting the validity of the annual survey. If changes are found, a partial survey or new full survey of the vessel may be necessary.\n1.4.1.3 Documentation & Reporting Requirements\nThe documentation required for vessel static offset surveys varies with the extent of the survey conducted. Documentation, as defined below, for static offset surveys shall be maintained by the field unit and available for review during Hydrographic Systems Reviews and at the request of OCS. Copies of documentation for all full and partial surveys shall be transmitted to HSTP. The dates, basic methodology used, and responsible professional survey agency (if applicable) for vessel static offset surveys shall be entered in the Hydrographic Systems Inventory. Any interim survey performed as a quality assurance check shall be described in the DAPR for all associated projects.\n8\n\n\f1.4.1.3.1 Full and Partial Surveys\nDocumentation for full and partial vessel offset surveys shall include the following:\n\u00b7 A full description of the equipment and technique employed, including diagrams showing the positions of setups and any pertinent technical data available for the instruments used for the survey. The survey location and description of how the vessel was leveled and immobilized, if applicable, should also be provided.\n\u00b7 Pictures and/or diagrams showing the general arrangement of the surveyed vessel and identifying the positions of benchmarks and instruments.\n\u00b7 An error analysis describing how the error values for each measurement were determined.\n\u00b7 Raw measurement data and a table of final results (including error estimates). A reviewer should be able to easily reconstruct the steps of data reduction from the information provided.\n\u00b7 A copy of Vessel Reports, generated in CARIS HIPS and SIPS Vessel Editor, for each resulting CARIS HIPS Vessel File (HVF).\n1.4.1.3.2 Verification Surveys\nDocumentation for verification of an existing full (or combination of full and partial) vessel offset survey shall include the following:\n\u00b7 A simple description of the equipment and techniques used for measurements.\n\u00b7 A reference to the full survey or combination of full and partial surveys that were verified.\n\u00b7 A copy of Vessel Reports, generated in CARIS HIPS and SIPS Vessel Editor, for each HVF which will remain in effect.\n\u00b7 Notation of any discrepancies discovered in the prior survey(s) and how these items were resolved.\n1.4.2 Vessel Dynamic Offsets\nDynamic offsets are those parameters of a vessel that are expected to change over relatively short time periods. The primary dynamic offset is vessel draft. A hydrographic survey vessel's draft and, therefore, the vertical position of the sonar transducer within the water column is affected by many factors, including the vessel's loading, weight distribution, and speed through the water. When addressed as one vessel characteristic, these effects are referred to as \"Dynamic Draft.\" Dynamic draft is the sum of \"Static Draft\" and \"Settlement and Squat\".\nStatic draft is the draft of the vessel at rest, fully loaded and outfitted for surveying. This value can be affected by the amount of equipment, fuel, personnel, and other gear loaded on the vessel, and is also a function of the density of the water in which the vessel is operating.\n\"Settlement\" is the purely vertical component of this vessel characteristic and is measured at the vessel's approximate center of motion. Although this vertical displacement is in the same direction as heave, settlement is usually filtered out of recorded heave data because its frequency is much lower than the cutoff frequency of high\n9\n\n\fpass filters typically associated with heave measurement devices. As a result, settlement must be measured and corrected for independently of heave action.\n\"Squat\" refers to the tendency of a vessel's stern to sink into the water as speed increases while operating in displacement mode (i.e., not on a plane). Squat typically results in a bow-up attitude, although a reverse effect may actually take place at higher speeds for some hull designs. Since echosounders are generally not mounted directly at a vessel's center of motion, squat acts on a lever arm from the center of motion to the echosounder, causing a vertical displacement of the transducer. On vessels equipped with attitude sensors, this effect is addressed as a part of attitude measurements and corrections. For vessels without attitude sensors, squat must be measured and corrected for as a part of dynamic draft.\n1.4.2.1 Calibration Requirements and Methods\n1.4.2.1.1 Static Draft\nAs part of Annual Systems Preparation, static draft shall be measured across the anticipated range of loading and buoyancy conditions. At a minimum, field units should track changes in static draft for a sufficient period of time to develop a statistically significant sample of values from which an error estimate can be produced. Depending on these results and the requirements of the survey, the frequency of draft measurements and updates of the HVF necessary during survey operations will vary. On some vessels, it may be necessary to measure static draft as often as twice a day, while annual measurements may be sufficient for others.\nFactors influencing the frequency of static draft measurement include the following:\n\u00b7 Survey Accuracy Required - If the error associated with static draft measurement is determined to be acceptable for meeting survey accuracy requirements, a single static draft value may be sufficient. This value should be the mean of multiple observations taken over a wide range of loading and buoyancy conditions for the vessel. If survey accuracy requirements increase, more frequent static draft measurements may be necessary.\n\u00b7 Loading Conditions - Vessels with a wide range of loading configurations will require more frequent static draft measurements than vessels with minimal loading changes. For example, many NOAA ships conduct survey operations both with and without launches in the davits, which can create a significant difference in vessel draft. Likewise, a hydrographic survey launch's static draft may vary noticeably with the amount of fuel loaded and the number of personnel embarked.\n\u00b7 Buoyancy - A vessel's static draft will vary with the density of the water in which it floats. If the vessel will be operating in waters with a wide range of densities (most strongly influenced by salinity), more frequent observation of static draft may be necessary. Additionally, water density may change significantly with project area, making static draft determined at one location inappropriate for survey operations in another area.\n1.4.2.1.1.1 Static Draft Measurement Techniques\nThe technique chosen to measure static draft may be influenced by the anticipated frequency of measurement required. Examples of measurement techniques include the following: Draft Marks on Hull - During the static offset measurement survey (see section 1.4.1) the vessel's hull can be marked with vertical elevation differences from the Vessel Reference Point. If this method is used, the hull should be marked on both the port and starboard sides, in the athwartships plane of the Vessel Reference Point. Static draft is then determined by averaging the port and starboard readings. Sight Tube - A more precise method for measuring static draft is a clear plastic or glass\n10\n\n\fsight tube installed in the interior of the vessel. This method can be particularly useful on hydrographic survey launches. The lower end of the tube is connected to a through-hull fitting below the waterline (with a valve at the hull), and the top is either connected to a through-hull above the waterline or extends sufficiently high enough above the waterline to prevent flooding. The clear portion of the sight tube, where measurements will be read, should be installed directly over (or as close as possible to) the vessel RP and graduated for direct measurement of the waterline offset from the reference point. Note: The static draft information is to be placed in the 'waterline' entry in the CARIS HVF.\n1.4.2.1.2 Dynamic Draft\nAt a minimum, dynamic draft shall be measured during Annual Systems Preparation. Although dynamic draft is a function of both hull shape and weight distribution, the influence of weight distribution is typically negligible. Thus, dynamic draft can be measured annually with the vessel in an average loading configuration, and the results combined with a range of static draft measurements for a final dynamic draft determination. Vessels with ancillary trim capabilities (e.g., trim tabs, jet drives, and outboard motors) should establish operating procedures to standardize vessel trim during survey operations.\n1.4.2.1.2.1 Dynamic Draft Measurement Techniques\nSettlement and squat are actually two separate parameters, but they can be easily measured together. If possible, this measurement should be accomplished in a body of water at least 7 times the vessel draft, where water level ,current effects, and wave conditions will be minimal for the period of the calibration. There are three common methods of determining dynamic draft values. Each method is described below.\nOptical Level\nThis technique uses an optical level to site the height of the vessel moving at different speeds through the water, relative to a fixed position ashore. The basic procedures are as follows:\n\u00b7 Set Up - Set up an optical level on shore near a channel or fairway where the vessel will be free to maneuver. The closer the level station is to where the vessel will traverse, the more accurate the readings will be. A pier is a valid location for the level station, but the pier must be a stable structure that does not exhibit significant movement over time. Level rods should be positioned on the port and starboard sides of the vessel. If the vessel to be calibrated is equipped with an attitude sensor, the level rods should be positioned in the athwartships plane of the vessel's approximate center of motion so that only settlement is measured (squat will be measured and corrected in conjunction with vessel attitude). If the vessel does not have an attitude sensor, the level rods should be located in the athwartships plane of the sonar transducer, which will combine squat effects in the measurement.\n\u00b7 Data Acquisition - Run the vessel in opposing directions (either perpendicular to or parallel with the level station line of sight) at various speeds, ranging from dead slow ahead to slightly faster than the maximum anticipated survey speed. On each run, the vessel must be allowed sufficient time to stabilize in attitude and speed prior to the measurement point. For each speed, a rod measurement should be taken on each side of the vessel. The port and starboard values for each speed are averaged to cancel the effect of any current or vessel list. Before and after each pair of runs, the elevation values for the vessel at rest should be measured in order to correct for any change in water levels over the course of the test. The data should be recorded in tabular format, with the final dynamic draft value for each speed being the difference between the average at rest readings (before and after each pair of runs) and the average of the port and starboard underway readings. 11\n\n\fPost-Processed Kinematic (PPK) GPS\n*Note: The technique and analysis use depends greatly on the vessel and the area in which you are working. If you have any questions, contact your HSTP representative before proceeding.\nThis technique uses the vessel's POS/MV system and POSPac data acquisition and processing to measure vessel ellipsoid heights at speeds relevant to survey operations. A polynomial regression of the changes in height is used to formulate a dynamic draft table with associated uncertainties. The Pydro macro ProcSBETDynamicDraft. py may be used for the dynamic draft table data analysis. This macro reads POSPac Smoothed Best Estimate Trajectory (SBET) dynamic draft calibration data, (optionally) adjusts for tidal water levels, and outputs graphs and tables per a 3rd or 4th-order polynomial regression. The basic procedures are as follows:\n\u00b7 Assumptions\n\u00b7 If the dynamic draft calibration test is performed in a tidally-active area, plan on performing the data analysis using the Pydro macro ProcSBETDynamicDraft.py (see below). This macro includes the ability to compensate for both discrete-zoned and TCARI water levels. Other data analysis may be used at the discretion of the field unit. A spreadsheet analysis may be used, particularly in areas with negligible tides, or during a time when water level changes due to tide will be negligible.\n\u00b7 Wave conditions need to be minimal as with all dynamic draft measurements.\n\u00b7 It is also assumed that the ellipsoid is relatively parallel to the water level over the area of this test. Time periods of static vessel heights at the end of each line will help to confirm this assumption. If there is evidence to the contrary once data has been acquired, another area may need to be selecte or another technique may need to be used for dynamic draft measurements.\nData Acquisition - Select an area where the water depth is sufficient to remove the strong effects of squat due to shallow water. The area should be large enough that you can acquire data between 2-5 minutes at speed, enough time to allow the vessel to settle out at speed. Start acquiring POSPac data at least 5 minutes before beginning the test. While consecutive changes in speed can be used, a one to two minute \"rest period\" between each speed change is recommended to capture offsets due to tides, currents or geoid shape. An adequate rest period length is a function of the hydrodynamic characteristics of the particular vessel; i.e., how long it takes for the given vessel to stablize to \"static\" conditions. Run lines in opposing directions taking into account current magnitudes and directions; data sampling should be balanced between lines progressing with and stemming the current. It is important to acquire lines at regular speed intervals over a range that is relevant to the multibeam survey work of the vessel;e.g., from barely maintaining steerage through 10+ knots, at an interval of 2 knots. Do NOT stop recording POSPac between lines; PPK processing performs best using uninterupted sessions of GPS data. Record the order in which you ran the speeds and what direction you went between each of the rest periods. A complete written record of the dynamic draft calibration fieldwork may prove invaluable in troubleshooting peculiar looking results later.\n12\n\n\f\u00b7 Data Processing - Data is processed in Applanix's POSPac software through either a SmartBase solution or a SingleBase solution. POSPac data can be processed referencing the rapid ephemeris solutions. Final ephemeris data can take up to 2 weeks to become available, and does not signifigantly change the calculated values. The data are processed through the GNSS-Inertial Processor in the Forwards, Backwards and Combine mode with the Roll, Pitch and Heading Initialization set to Initialize from the real time solution and the Lever Arm Standard Deviation ideally known to 3cm or better (The lever arm standard deviation should be set based on how well you actually know your lever arms). SBETs may be decimated to 1Hz to alleviate the processing load in Data Analysis, without any detrimental effects. Control station auto-adjust should never be used for processing SBETs.\n\u00b7 Data Analysis - A time series of both speed and ellipsoid heights, as well as a plot of speed versus ellipsoid heights should be examined to ensure data quality and to look for offsets. A polynomial least squares fit regression on speed versus ellipsoid height is completed with user preferred software. A minimum of a third order regression should be used. A comparison between the regression and the plotted data should be completed both through a raw plot with regression curve and through the ellipsoid height minus regression residuals. Changes in the ellipsoid height not captured by the curve should be noted and changes to the regression process may be needed. Take special care to note the zero speed crossing, as it can result in vertical offsets in the dynamic draft table. Careful examination here cannot be emphasized enough.\nOnce a satisfactory curve is obtained, a dynamic draft table can be created between regular speed increments and the corresponding height from the regression equation subtracting the zero speed ellipsoid height constant. Since the table for CARIS HIPS is a correction file, increases in draft with speed result in positive values in the HIPS table. Uncertainty in the dynamic draft table is obtained by calculating two standard deviations of the residual data to regression difference. If uncertainty for each speed is desired the residuals can be binned by speed and the standard deviation calculated for each bin. Care should be taken that sufficient data exists in each bin.\nAs mentioned previously, all of the required data analysis, from SBET to dynamic draf table\u00adincluding tide compensation, can be achieved via the Pydro macro ProcSBETDynamicDraf.py. Complete details about using this macro may be found in the Ellipsoidally Referenced Survey SOP.pdf in Appendix 4.\nReal-Time Kinematic (RTK) GPS\nProcedures are currently being developed for a real-time kinematic GPS determination of dynamic draft. These methods have not yet been approved by OCS and shall not be used for Annual Systems Preparation.\nEchosounder\nThis technique uses a vessel's MBES system to determine dynamic draft. A detailed procedure is described below.\n\u00b7 Data Acquisition -Data should be acquired in an area with a flat seafloor and relatively shallow water. Water depth should also be at least seven times the vessel draft to reduce attitude bias. The geographical location should be as close as possible to a water level station. If the survey time is planned to minimize currents, adequate data can typically be acquired by running in one common direction for all vessel speeds. If currents are significant, it will be necessary to acquire data in opposing directions for each speed and average thetwo values. As with the optical level method, vessel attitude and speed must be stable while acquiring data.\n\u00b7 Line Acquisition -Plan a survey line approximately 1000 meters in length. Establish a center reference point for three approximately 20m2 reference areas located at distances of \u00bc, \u00bd, and \u00be along the line as shown in Figure 1.1. Acquire data along the line at various RPM intervals, ranging from the minimum to the maximum 13\n\n\fspeed anticipated for survey operations. Minimize across-track error during line navigation and establish a constant speed and heading prior to logging data. Monitor and minimize induced heave during data acquisition. Run the line in coincidental directions for redundancy. To minimize induced heave, allow time for the IMU to stabilize before reacquiring data.\nFigure 1.1: Recommended line plan for determining dynamic draf using a vessel's echosounder.\n\u00b7 Reference Area Acquisition - At each reference area, acquire data along the line at the lowest speed possible while maintaining heading and stable attitude to create a baseline with negligible dynamic draft. It is recommended that reference area data be acquired both before and after line acquisition to bracket and evaluate any significant water level variation. Compare these zero or at-rest settlement and squat measurements with each of the at-speed measurements to determine offsets caused by speed variation. If the seafloor is not flat, several passes may be required at each reference area to create an accurate reference surface. Conduct a sound velocity cast near the center reference point. The reference area acquisition is considered the \"At rest\" depth and should be the baseline to which you compare the depths acquired at speed.\n\u00b7 If there is concern for induced draft while moving over the targets, an alternative reference surface calculation can be made utilizing Drift Line Measurement: If the reference or drift line is run perpendicular to the analysis line it will produce a swath sufficient enough for data acquisition. If you are conducting this dynamic draft test on a vessel with a 1.5 meter draft your test should be performed in at least 10.5 meters (35 feet) of water. At that water depth the average swath width would be 36.75 meters (122.5 feet).\n\u00b7 Processing Soundings - If the echosounder system used for data acquisition performs real-time heave filtering, convert the data without applying true heave. Long-period heave will bias dynamic draft calculations. Random, short-period heave should cancel out during statistical averaging of reference surface depths. Filter soundings to reject all but those with the highest data quality flag.\n\u00b7 A surface should contain only the drift line or reference area lines.\n\u00b7 Separate surfaces should be made at each rpm interval (i.e. if lines were run at 600, 800, and 1000 rpm, create a grid for each of the 600, 800, and 1000 rpm drift lines).\n\u00b7 Sample all line surfaces and the reference surface soundings using an approximately 3 m x 20 m subset area at each of the three reference areas. Minimally clean subsets for gross fliers and noise. Select and query all soundings from each subset dataset and save each CARIS query window as a text file. This can be done by simply copying and pasting directly into a MS Excel spreadsheet. Import these text files into MS Excel as tabdelimited records. Sort these Excel data by line ID and calculate the median surface depth (use =MEDIAN (c#:c#) ) for each speed level at each reference area. Typical sample populations should be between 3,000 \u00ad 5,000 soundings (use =COUNTA (c#:c#) to check).\n14\n\n\f\u00b7 The reference surface should be sampled first to be used as the control in the data analysis.\n\u00b7 Coincidental lines should be sampled together in the same surface.\n\u00b7 Navigation/Speed - Using the CARIS Navigation Editor, query position fixes for individual lines within each reference area subset. Save each query as a text file and import these data into Excel as tab-delimited records. Calculate the average speed for each RPM in each of the reference areas (use =average (c#:c#).\n\u00b7 Offset Tables - For each reference area, subtract the median reference area depth from median depths for each RPM/speed interval to calculate relative dynamic draft offsets. Plot Speed vs. Offset for each of the 3 reference areas to evaluate data consistency. Average data from the \u00bc, \u00bd and \u00be point reference areas to calculate final dynamic draft values.\n\u00b7 Error Analysis -The standard deviation of each speed correction should be calculated by comparing the values derived from each surface area. The largest standard deviation value should be entered into the vessel's HVF for dynamic draft error. Note that in CARIS, the squat and settlement is entered in as \"delta draft\" or the positive change in draft as the draft increases and negative as the draft decreases.\n1.4.2.2 Periodic Quality Assurance Checks\nStatic draft shall be re-measured at whatever frequency determined necessary to meet survey specifications. However, at a minimum, static draft should be checked against previous survey values at the start of a new project and whenever a vessel will be conducting survey operations with an atypical loading configuration. Dynamic draft shall be re-measured if the vessel's hull shape is altered, significant changes in weight distribution of the vessel have been made, or other physical alterations have been made to the vessel that may affect dynamic draft values.\n1.4.2.3 Documentation and Reporting Requirements\nDynamic offset measurement documentation shall be broken into two separate sections, one for static draft and one for dynamic draft measurements. All information listed below should be documented. This documentation shall be maintained by the field unit and available for review during Hydrographic Systems Reviews and at the request of OCS. The dates and basic methodology used to determine dynamic offset measurements shall be reported in the DAPR for each applicable project. The actual frequency of static draft measurements, any significant changes to static draft, and any subsequent changes to dynamic draft should also be included with this documentation.\nStatic draft measurement documentation shall include the following:\n\u00b7 A complete description of the procedure used to determine draft and estimate error.\n\u00b7 Geographical location where measurements were made and number of observations used for draft determination.\n\u00b7 Raw draft measurement data in tabular format and error estimate calculations.\n\u00b7 Final static draft values, as applied in the CARIS HVF.\n\u00b7 The frequency with which draft will be measured during subsequent survey operations, with justification for this decision.\n15\n\n\fDynamic draft measurement documentation shall include the following:\n\u00b7 A complete description of the procedure used to determine dynamic draft, with a chartlet identifying the geographical area where measurements were made.\n\u00b7 Raw data with sufficient explanation of data reduction to enable recalculation of the final dynamic draft values and error estimates.\n\u00b7 Final dynamic draft values, as applied in the CARIS HVF.\nNote: Think carefully about the sign of the dynamic draft values placed in the Draft sensor entry in the CARIS HVF. CARIS expects the change in Z to be a positive down, so a sinking of transducer creates a shallower depth than the \"true depth\", and the dynamic draft value will be positive. If the vessel rises in the water, the measured depth will be deeper than the \"true depth\" and the dynamic draft value will be negative. Depth= Observed depth \u00ad Waterline + change in depth.\n1.4.3 Wiring diagrams\nAll field units should maintain up-to-date wiring diagrams for each of their survey vessels. These wiring diagrams should be reviewed and updated during the Annual Systems Preparation process.\n1.5 Hardware Systems\nHardware systems used by NOAA field units for hydrographic survey operations consist of a variety of technologically advanced echosounders and attitude sensors and each instrument must be properly maintained and calibrated in order to provide quality data.\nCalibration, maintenance, documentation, and reporting requirements established by OCS for common hardware systems used by NOAA hydrographic field units are described in sections 1.5.1 . New sensors and instruments unique to only one or two field units may not be addressed in this manual. Likewise, as NOAA's organizational expertise with existing systems continues to grow, new and improved procedures that supersede those documented here will be developed. In such cases, this section of the FPM shall be used as a guide for the development, implementation, and documentation of new procedures. If a new procedure is used, it must be approved by HSTP and documented with sufficient detail for the process to be recreated.\n1.5.1 Position, Attitude, and Heading Sensors\nFor OCS hydrographic surveys, vessel position is typically determined using a variety of GPS based positioning methods, as described in the Hydrographic Survey Specifications and Deliverables (HSSD). Attitude sensors are often employed to measure a vessel's roll and pitch about its RP and any purely vertical heave action affecting the vessel. The vessel's orientation about its vertical axis (i.e., yaw) is generally determined with a heading sensor or gyroscopic compass. Attitude and heading values measured by these sensors are typically applied to sounding data during post-processing. Each of the aforementioned sensors may be stand-alone systems, or they may be integrated into a navigation system that will collectively determine vessel position, attitude, and heading.\n16\n\n\fNote: Not all NOAA hydrographic field units may be outfitted with an attitude sensor. However, this equipment will be included on any NOAA vessel used to acquire multibeam echosounder data. Vessel attitude must be measured and applied to multibeam data to produce accurate soundings. Due to the wide beam angle of vertical beam echosounders (VBES), attitude corrections are less critical for this type of data. However, CARIS HIPS is capable of applying attitude data to VBES when available.\nThe Applanix POS/MV (Position and Orientation System/Marine Vessel), a GPS-aided inertial navigation system, is the most common system used by NOAA hydrographic field units to measure vessel position, attitude, and heading. As such, the POS/MV calibration and reporting requirements are specifically addressed in this manual. Field units equipped with alternate position, attitude, or heading sensors shall contact the regional HSTP Field Support Liaison to develop approved calibration and maintenance requirements.\n1.5.1.1 Applanix POS/MV\nThe POS/MV navigation system will calculate survey-quality vessel position, heading, and attitude data. Primary system components consist of a processing unit, two GPS antennas, and an inertial measurement unit (IMU), which is typically installed at the vessel's RP for NOAA configurations.\n1.5.1.1.1 Calibration Requirements and Methods\nAt a minimum, NOAA hydrographic field units shall calibrate the POS/MV during Annual Systems Preparation. Additionally, the POS/MV shall be recalibrated after any IMU or antenna installations, movements, and/or modifications. The appropriate POS/MV Installation and Operation Guide will contain comprehensive guidance on system operation and calibration.\nNote: Although the POS/MV Installation and Operation Guide refers to the calibration process as \"antenna installation calibration,\" it should be performed following any physical antenna or IMU adjustments, not just antenna installation. Additionally, all IMUs shall be turned in to the regional Electronics and Engineering Division (EED) depot every three years so that the units can be shipped to Applanix for factory service and recertification. If a field unit has been equipped with a Version 4 or higher POS/MV system, it is possible to perform an additional lever-arm calibration. However, this calibration should not be attempted without appropriate Real Time Kinematic (RTK) support. Field units should contact the regional HSTP Field Support Liaison for RTK support prior to conducting a lever-arm calibration.\n1.5.1.1.1.1 Offsets & Reference Frame Conventions\nPrior to calibration, POS/MV lever arm distances should be entered, as necessary, and/or verified in the POS/ MV controller software. Be very careful not to enter values for offsets that will be applied to data during postprocessing via the HVF. If the IMU is collocated with the vessel's RP and CM, the distance from the IMU to the primary GPS antenna (port side for OCS configurations) and the distance between GPS antennas may be the only offsets that need to be entered in the POS/MV controller software. Measured antenna separation distance must be accurate to within 5 mm, per the manufacturer's specifications. Refer to the POS/MV Installation and Operation Guide for additional measurement accuracy requirements and coordinate system conventions. Note: Be certain that offsets entered in the POS/MV controller software correspond to the local POS/MV coordinate system, which may differ from the vessel reference frame coordinate system. A summary of coordinate systems for common OCS systems and software is included in Appendix 1 (Coordinate_Systems.pdf).\n17\n\n\f1.5.1.1.1.2 Performing the Calibration\nDetailed instructions for performing a POS/MV calibration should be reviewed in the POS/MV Installation and Operation Guide. For a successful calibration, the POS/MV GPS Azimuth Measurement Subsystem (GAMS) must have data available from 7 or more satellites and a Positional Dilution of Precision (PDOP) equal to or less than 3.0. The calibration should be performed at a time when satellite geometry is good. GPS mission planning software can be used to identify an optimal calibration time, during which the PDOP will be at a minimum. Mission planning software is included on the Hydrosoft website https://inside.nos.noaa.gov/hydrosoft/welcome. html, or at no charge from Trimble at www.trimble.com/planningsoftware.html.\nThe POS/MV calibration should be performed in an open area where unrestricted maneuvering is possible and there are few vertical features likely to produce multipath signals. Set the user multipath setting to \"Low\" to allow the system to calibrate with the highest accuracy. It is important for heading accuracy to settle to less than the threshold set under the GAMS Installation Parameters before performing a calibration.\nNote: This threshold shall always be set to 0.5 degrees or less when calibrating systems for OCS survey operations. Maneuvering the vessel in a figure eight pattern will help bring the heading accuracy within this range. Once a calibration is started, it often takes more than the 1-2 minutes on a straight course stated in the POS/MV Installation and Operation Guide for the \"CAL in Progress\" process to complete. After a successful calibration, save the new calibration values into non-volatile memory as described in the POS/MV Installation and Operation Guide, and save a copy of the final POS/MV configuration file for reference. A method for computing the lever arm offsets is outlined in the Ellipsoidally Referenced Survey SOP.pdf in Appendix 4.\n1.5.1.1.2 Periodic Quality Assurance Checks\nOnce a high-quality POS/MV calibration has been performed, it should remain valid until system components are moved or altered. The POS/MV should operate reliably provided adequate satellite coverage and differential correctors are available. If the POS/MV becomes problematic, recalibration may be conducted at the discretion of the field unit. If a recalibration is desired, the same process used for the annual calibration should be repeated.\nNote: If the POS/MV is recalibrated, a new patch test should be performed for any associated multibeam echosounder systems. (Refer to section 1.5.5.1.2 for a description of the patch test).\nFor each calibration conducted, system settings, procedures, and results achieved should be recorded in a POS/ MV Calibration Report. A blank report form is included in Appendix 1 (POS-MV_Cal_Report.pdf), with sample data entered in red font. This documentation shall be maintained by the field unit and available for review during Hydrographic Systems Reviews and at the request of OCS. The dates of current POS/MV calibrations shall be reported in the Hydrographic Systems Inventory. All POS/MV calibrations conducted shall be described in the DAPR for each applicable project.\n1.5.2 Sound Speed Measurement Instruments\nAccurate measurements of sound speed (often referred to as \"sound velocity\") both through the water column and at the water's surface are critical to hydrography, particularly if soundings are acquired using a multibeam echosounder. Two basic types of sound speed instruments are currently used by NOAA hydrographic field units, those which directly measure sound speed (commonly referred to as \"velocimeters\") and those which measure conductivity, temperature and depth and then calculate sound speed (commonly referred to as \"CTDs\"). All field units performing OCS surveys shall proactively monitor the accuracy of sound speed measuring instruments and conduct preventative maintenance as described below.\n18\n\n\f1.5.2.1 Calibration Requirements and Methods\nAll sound speed measuring instruments employed by NOAA hydrographic field units shall be calibrated annually and inspected by the manufacturer, unless the manufacturer recommends a different time period. Field units should turn in all sound speed measuring instruments to the regional EED depot promptly after arriving for winter inport or during another suitable period of inactivity. EED will arrange for the instruments to be returned to the manufacturer for calibration and inspection. This process takes approximately six weeks.\nNote: For DigibarPro systems, only the probe needs to be returned for annual calibration. There is no need to remove the cable or display unit from the vessel unless these components require repair or replacement. Field units that can not feasibly submit sound speed measuring instruments to the regional EED depot shall contact EED to coordinate a direct submission to the manufacturer. Following annual calibrations, comparisons equivalent to the Data Quality Assurance processes described in section 1.5.2.2 shall be conducted for all sound speed measuring instruments.\n1.5.2.2 Periodic Quality Assurance Checks\nPeriodic quality assurance checks shall be performed for all sound speed measuring instruments. NOAA hydrographic platforms shall conduct these quality assurance checks on a daily or weekly basis as described below. Field units with sound speed measurement instruments not addressed in this manual should contact the regional HSTP Field Support Liaison to develop a comparable quality assurance plan.\n1.5.2.2.1 Daily Data Quality Assurance (Daily DQA)\nIf the vessel is equipped with a surface sound speed measuring instrument (typically installed at the head of a multibeam sonar), compare a measurement from this instrument to the results of a full sound speed profile acquired at the beginning of each day the surface instrument will be used. This comparison can be performed in NOAA's Velocipy software, which is a second generation of the Velocwin, using the \"Surface Sound Speed DQA\" function. All discrepancies greater than 1 m/s should be noted and tracked to determine if the instrument requires repairs or recalibration. Note: NOAA hydrographic field units have experienced several failures with this type of instrument. Since surface sound speed data is critical for acquiring data with flat-faced MBES systems, these instruments must be monitored and tested each day prior to operations.\n1.5.2.2.2 Regular Data Quality Assurance (Regular DQA)\nA full water column profile from each sound speed profiling instrument shall be compared to an independent source at least once during each leg of survey operations or every two weeks during survey operations This comparison should be accomplished by conducting a simultaneous cast with two profiling instruments and comparing the results using Velocipy's \"Compare Two Profiles\" function. Caution: If simultaneous casts are processed in Velocipy using the same vessel name, the processed file names will be identical and one will be overwritten. The user should rename the first file processed to avoid this potential problem. Data from two different types of profilers can be used for this comparison, provided both datasets have been initially processed in Velocipy. Comparison casts should be conducted in water at least as deep as typical depths for the current project.\nNote: If a Digibar is to be used for a simultaneous cast, first conduct a Velocipy \"Digibar DQA\" comparison for the instrument using a fresh water sample.\n19\n\n\f1.5.2.3 General Maintenance Practices\nVelocimeters and CTDs should be rinsed with freshwater at the end of the day after use. The moving parts of the winch on the Moving Vessel Profiler (MVP) system requires weekly lubrication of its moving parts (e.g. gears and levelwind) to maintain effectiveness and to sustain its lifetime. It is also highly recommended to shift the messenger on the MVP every 24 hours of continuous use however armoring may make this more tedious. Field units should routinely do an inspection of the MVP towfish.\n1.5.2.4 Documentation and Reporting Requirements\nResults from annual sound speed instrument calibrations, i.e., manufacturer's documentation and the corresponding digital calibration coefficient file, shall be maintained by the field unit and available for review during Hydrographic Systems Reviews or at the request of OCS. The dates of annual calibrations and any instrument problems or nonroutine maintenance performed shall be reported in the Hydrographic Systems Inventory.\nIf using Velocipy, the results of each DQA test performed will be sorted by project number and saved to a file named <project number>.DQA, (e.g., OPR-A###-AA-YY.DQA) in the \"SVfiles\" directory. If Velocipy is not used for weekly data quality assessments, these comparisons shall be manually recorded. DQA records associated with each survey shall be included in Separates II of the Descriptive Report. Documentation for all calibrations or maintenance conducted shall be included in the DAPR for each applicable project.\n1.5.3 Manual Depth Measurement Equipment\nAlthough no longer used as a primary means of survey, lead lines and sounding poles are invaluable for some operations. These tools can be used to take soundings in areas too shallow for echosounders or to verify least depths over dangers to navigation or shoals. The most common use of lead lines is as a calibration standard for echosounders. However, like all measuring devices, these tools have their own calibration requirements. Both lead line and sounding pole requirements are addressed in this section.\n1.5.3.1 Calibration Requirements and Methods\n1.5.3.1.1 Lead Lines\nAll field units engaged in hydrographic surveys where general depths are less than 40 meters shall carry one or more marked and calibrated lead lines. Depending on the depths in which they will be used and the size of the vessel, OCS recommends that lead lines are 30m to 60m long. Each lead line shall be marked with a numerical identifier to be retained throughout the life of the lead line or until re-marking is necessary.\nTraditional lead line material is mahogany-colored tiller rope with a phosphor-bronze wire center. Specifications for this material and directions for making and maintaining a traditional lead line can be found in Appendix 1 (Leadline_Sndngpole_Directions.pdf). Since line and tape materials have evolved significantly and lead lines are now used in special circumstances, rather than for entire surveys, it may be appropriate for alternate materials to be used when constructing a lead line. When choosing a lead line material, key properties to be considered are strength and elasticity. The line or tape must not part if deployed from a vessel underway and must not stretch significantly under tension or when wet.\n20\n\n\fAll lead lines used for OCS hydrographic surveys shall be graduated to at least the decimeter level. Any convenient system of marking that will minimize reading errors may be used, provided each whole meter of line is marked and identified with a clearly written numerical depth value.\nLead lines shall be calibrated by comparison with a known standard during Annual Systems Preparation and prior to each day's use if constructed with non-traditional material. The testing standard should be a survey quality metal tape, pre-measured graduation marks on deck or ashore, or similar item. If the mean correction exceeds 0.1m the lead line must be re-marked.\n1.5.3.1.2 Sounding Poles\nWhen surveying in depths too shallow for an echosounder, it may be prudent to use a sounding pole if the area is flat and the waters are protected. Sounding poles shall not be used in depths greater than 4 meters and are typically not used in depths greater than 2 meters.\nA traditional sounding pole is made from a meter length of 1.5 inch (3.81 cm) round lumber capped with a weighted metal shoe at each end to hasten sinking. Shorter poles may be used, depending on the depth conditions. Directions for making and maintaining a traditional sounding pole can be found in Appendix 1 (Leadline_ Sndngpole_Directions.pdf). Since modern pole, pipe, and stick materials are readily available and sounding poles are now used in special circumstances, rather than for entire surveys, it may be appropriate for alternate materials to be used when constructing a sounding pole. When choosing a sounding pole material, key properties to be considered are strength, weight, and bluntness. The pole must not significantly bend if deployed from a vessel underway or weaken when wet. Additionally, it must not be so buoyant or sink so rapidly that it becomes difficult to handle and must not penetrate the seafloor to an extent that would generate erroneous soundings.\nAll sounding poles used for OCS hydrographic surveys shall be graduated in meters to at least the decimeter level. Any convenient system of marking that will minimize reading errors may be used.\nAny sounding pole maintained aboard a NOAA hydrographic vessel shall be calibrated during Annual Systems Preparation. Calibration shall be against a known standard, such as a survey quality metal tape, to ensure that depth markings are unambiguous and accurate. Sounding poles created between Annual Systems Preparation events shall be calibrated prior to use on an OCS hydrographic survey.\n1.5.3.2 Periodic Quality Assurance Checks\nDue to the static nature and infrequent use of manual depth measurement equipment, there are no requirements for accuracy checks, other than annual calibrations, if traditional lead lines or a regularly maintained sounding pole is being used. As previously stated, lead lines constructed with non-traditional material shall be calibrated prior to each day's use, and sounding poles created on-the-fly for special circumstances encountered shall be calibrated prior to use on any OCS hydrographic survey.\n1.5.3.3 Documentation and Reporting Requirements\nA Lead Line and Sounding Pole Calibration Report shall be completed each time a lead line or sounding pole is made or compared to a standard. A report form is provided in Appendix 1 (Leadline_SndngPole_Cal_Report. pdf), with sample data in red font. Reports for calibrations conducted during Annual Systems Preparation shall be maintained by the field unit and available for review during Hydrographic Systems Reviews and at the request of\n21\n\n\fOCS. The dates of current calibrations shall be reported in the Hydrographic Systems Inventory. Documentation for calibrations shall be included in the DAPR for each applicable project.\nIn addition to the above reporting requirements, a full Sounding System Comparison shall be completed each year as a part of Annual Systems Preparation, following calibration of all sounding systems. A lead line shall be used to manually acquire a standard for comparison to calculated depths from each of the field unit's vertical beam echosounders, multibeam echosounders, and diver least depth gauges. This process shall be documented according to the example provided in Appendix 1 (Sndng_Sys_Comparison_Log.pdf) and included in the DAPR for each applicable project.\n1.5.4 Vertical Beam Echosounder (VBES) Systems\nNOAA hydrographic field units may use VBES systems for water depth measurement and/or to confirm depths measured by other systems, such as multibeam echosounders. The consistency and accuracy of VBES soundings are directly related to the care with which these instruments are calibrated, maintained, and operated. It is critical that field units both ensure these systems are properly calibrated and educate operators about the effects of manually adjusting the transceiver controls such as power, gain, and sensitivity.\nVertical beam echosounders are typically either dual frequency or single frequency. Users should operate each echosounder in accordance with its manufacturer's documentation. When used for OCS hydrographic surveys, VBES systems shall be set with an assumed speed of sound through water of 1500 m/s. Recorded sounding data shall be corrected for actual sound speed, determined with a sound speed profiling instrument, during data postprocessing.\n1.5.4.1 Calibration Requirements and Methods\nThe field unit shall verify, during Annual Systems Preparation, that VBES sounding data are accurate and that each system is in proper working order. While a lead line comparison is the minimum VBES calibration requirement, a simultaneous comparison of lead line, VBES, multibeam echosounder, and diver least depth gauge (DLDG) data is also required by OCS during Annual Systems Preparation. (Refer to section 1.5.3.3 for details on Sounding System Comparison.) If the VBES unit is found to be out of calibration, it should be sent to the regional EED depot, which will return it to the manufacturer for repair. Field units that can not feasibly submit VBES systems to the regional EED depot shall contact EED to coordinate a direct submission to the manufacturer.\nWhen performing sounding system comparisons, the vessel should, ideally, be anchored in an area with a flat sandy bottom and calm sea conditions. If comparisons will also be made to DLDG data, the water depth should be between 10 and 20 meters. The lead line depth should be measured from a location close to the transducer and timed as near as possible to slack water to minimize any effect from current on the lead line. If the vessel has a known list or is large enough that a level platform can not be accurately determined, simultaneous lead line readings should be taken from each side of the vessel and averaged.\n1.5.4.1.0.1 HYPACK Latency Test\nThe following HYPACK latency test procedures should be performed for vessels operating a single beam echosounder and no POS/MV or motion compensator. This test is used to solve for the delay in time between the GPS \"time tag\" and the HYPACK PC time stamp.\n22\n\n\f\u00b7 Run reciprocal lines perpendicular to a slope of a feature and determine the timing\nFigure 1.2: HYPACK Timing Bias Calibration \u00b7 The Latency Test for the Single Beam Echosounder is found in the utilities menu of HYPACK \u00b7 Open the two lines acquired in the latency test program \u00b7 Review Cross Section\nFigure 1.3: HYPACK Review Cross Section Window \u00b7 Open the Adjustment window and perform the automatic latency calculation\n23\n\n\fFigure 1.4: HYPACK Adjustments window\n\u00b7 Perform three separate tests and use the average of the results\nOnce the user has determined the final latency value, it can be entered in the offsets menu on the HYPACK device parameters or it can be added to the navigation timing lever arm correction in the CARIS HVF file. (*note only add the offset in once!)\n1.5.4.2 Periodic Quality Assurance Checks\nFor modern digital VBES systems, instrument errors are generally small, fixed in magnitude, and independent observed depths. However, to ensure that echosounders continue to operate properly, periodic confidence checks should be conducted. A confidence check can be accomplished by comparing VBES soundings to lead line readings, nadir multibeam echosounder depths, or DLDG data. As when performing a calibration, routine comparisons should be conducted in an area with a relatively flat and hard bottom, when sea conditions are calm.\nConfidence checks shall be conducted at least once per week for all surveys performed with VBES systems. Any discrepancies identified between sounding systems that are greater than the allowable depth error for the corresponding survey must be investigated to determine if the equipment is in need of repairs.\n1.5.4.3 Documentation and Reporting Requirements\nResults of VBES calibrations and confidence checks shall be recorded in a Sounding System Comparison Log to be maintained by the field unit. A comparison log is included in Appendix 1 (Snding_Sys_Comparison.\n24\n\n\fpdf) with sample data in red font. Calibration records for each VBES used for hydrographic surveying shall be available for review during Hydrographic Systems Reviews and at the request of OCS. Sounding System Comparison Logs shall be included in the DAPR for all applicable surveys.\n1.5.5 Multibeam Echosounder (MBES) Systems\nNOAA's hydrographic survey units use MBES systems to acquire full- and partial- bottom bathymetric coverage throughout a survey area, to determine least depths over critical items such as wrecks, obstructions, and dangersto-navigation, and for general object detection. Field personnel should refer to section 5.2 of the HSSD.\nProper calibration of MBES systems is critical for maintaining ahigh level of accuracy and meeting OCS hydrographic survey specifications. Various models of swath-type multibeam sonars are used for NOAA hydrographic survey operations. For the purposes of this document these MBES systems will be treated as equivalent units unless otherwise specified.\n1.5.5.1 Calibration Requirements and Methods\nMBES performance is largely a function of the original system specifications. To ensure that MBES systems used for OCS surveys continue to perform adequately, all systems should be maintained and serviced in accordance with manufacturers specifications.\n1.5.5.1.1 Offset Measurement and Verification\nOffsets for MBES systems shall be measured and/or verified as part of the vessel static offsets survey described in section 1.4.1. OCS typically uses two types of MBES configurations, hull-mounted and pole- or lever mounted. Particular attention must be paid to the alignment of the sonar head with respect to the keel of the survey vessel, as a very small alignment error can introduce significant positioning errors in the data.\nIn addition to the above alignment considerations, pole- and lever-mounted systems introduce another potential source of positioning error. Since these systems are deployed and retrieved after each use, care must be taken to insure that the sonar is both stabilized during use (via pins, guy wires, or the like) and that its deployed position does not vary. Stabilizing mechanisms should be inspected regularly for wear, stretching or general deterioration that could affect the sonar offsets or stability.\n1.5.5.1.2 MBES Calibration\nAs part of Annual Systems Preparation, field parties shall conduct a system calibration to quantify the accuracy, precision, and alignment for each MBES system. At a minimum, the calibration shall include determination of residual biases in roll, pitch, heading, and navigation timing error. This procedure, commonly referred to as a \"patch test\", is performed by acquiring data that will highlight only one bias parameter at a time. The patch test should be conducted in accordance with section 5.2.4.1 of the HSSD.\nGenerally two lines of data must be acquired to resolve each bias. Vessel speed, direction and/or seafloor slope will be specified for each line. Figure 1.5 illustrates the most efficient line plan for conducting a patch test; however, lines for each bias may be completed in separate areas if an ideal geographical location is unavailable. Once patch test data has been acquired, system integration errors are determined by aligning slopes and targets acquired from different directions and speeds.\n25\n\n\fFigure 1.5: Most efficient line plan for MBES calibration testing\nOnce bias correctors are determined for a system, the appropriate values should be entered into the CARIS HVF for the corresponding vessel. If problems become apparent in the data or any part of the echosounder system configuration is changed or damaged, a new system calibration must be conducted.\n1.5.5.2 Periodic Quality Assurance Checks\nMBES confidence checks shall be performed in accordance with section 5.2.4.1 of the HSSD. Confidence checks shall be performed at least once during each survey conducted by multiple vessels that acquire overlapping data. Surveys conducted with only a single vessel, shall perform confidence checks at least once per week. A confidence check can be accomplished by comparing nadir MBES values to lead line readings, VBES depths, or DLDG data. These comparisons should be conducted in an area with a relatively flat and hard bottom, when sea conditions are calm. Any discrepancies identified between sounding systems that are greater than the allowable depth error for the corresponding survey must be investigated to determine if the equipment is in need of repairs.\n1.5.5.3 Documentation and Reporting Requirements\nEach patch test conducted shall be documented in a MBES Calibration Table. A copy of this table is provided in Appendix 1 (MBES_Cal_Table.pdf) with sample data entered in red font. In addition to a MBES Calibration Table, a chartlet showing the test area and line plan, with line numbers and headings clearly identified, shall be created for each system tested. The exact format of these chartlets is left to the discretion of the hydrographer. Calibration information shall be maintained by the field unit and available for review during Hydrographic Systems Reviews and at the request of OCS. Copies of patch test documentation shall be submitted with the DAPR for each applicable project.\nResults of each MBES confidence check shall be recorded in a Sounding System Comparison Log to be maintained by the field unit. A comparison example is included in Appendix 1 (Snding_Sys_Comparison.pdf) with sample data in red font. Sounding System Comparison Logs shall be included in DAPR for all applicable projects.\n26\n\n\f1.5.6 Diver Least Depth Gauge (DLDG)\nThe DLDG is a portable, self-contained, diver-deployed instrument that measures pressure in absolute pounds per square inch (PSIA). Least depth values are computed from the difference between surface pressure (pre-dive) and the pressure observed by the diver at a feature's least depth.\n1.5.6.1 Calibration Requirements and Methods\nEach DLDG used for OCS hydrographic surveys shall be calibrated annually. These instruments should be submitted to the regional EED depot promptly after arriving for winter inport or during another suitable period of inactivity. EED will arrange for the instruments to be returned to the manufacturer for calibration and inspection. Field units that cannot feasibly submit DLDGs to the regional EED depot shall contact EED to coordinate a direct submission to the manufacturer.\nOnce the DLDG calibration report has been received, a copy must be forwarded to HSTP. HSTP personnel will generate, and provide to the field unit, a digital corrector file that must be loaded into Velocipy software to facilitate DLDG pressure data processing. After calibration, a Sounding System Comparison including depths computed using the DLDG shall be performed and recorded according to the example provided in Appendix 1 (Sndng_Sys_Comparison.pdf).\n1.5.6.2 Periodic Quality Assurance Checks\nVelocipy software includes a DLDG DQA utility, which compares the DLDG pressure measurement in air to barometric pressure. This comparison routine should be performed daily to record a relationship between the vessel's barometer and the DLDG. The DLDG DQA should also be performed before and after each day's dive operations to provide a pre-dive and post-dive record. If inconsistencies between the barometer and calculated DLDG pressure become apparent, the DLDG may require repair or recalibration. The DLDG DQA routine in Velocipy generates a graphic display of the DLDG pressure with respect to acceptable error margins. The test passes if the new DLDG data point (red dot) lies within the two dashed lines representing the acceptable error boundaries. Prior Daily DQA results are also displayed on this graph for comparison. Each time a Daily DQA is performed, the data are appended to a digital file DIVERDAILYDQA.DAT.\n1.5.6.3 Documentation and Reporting Requirements\nThe manufacturer's DLDG calibration report, HSTP generated digital corrector file, and results of the post calibration Sounding System Comparison shall be maintained by the field unit and available for review during annual Hydrographic Systems Review and at the request of OCS. The DAILYDQA.DAT file and reports for any additional Sounding System Comparisons shall be included in the DAPR for each applicable project.\n1.5.7 Side Scan Sonar (SSS) Systems\nNOAA hydrographic survey units use side scan sonar systems for both object detection and object recognition. Side scan sonar is typically used in conjunction with a VBES or MBES system to meet object detection coverage specifications for OCS surveys. Any SSS system used for OCS hydrography must be capable of detecting an object on the sea floor with minimum dimensions of 1 m x 1 m x 1 m, as stated in section 6.1.2.1 of the HSSD.\n27\n\n\fOCS uses both hull mounted and towed SSS system configurations. Horizontal accuracy for SSS operations will depend on the system configuration, investigation technique, water depth, and target density. However, the position of targets identified with side scan imagery must be sufficiently accurate to relocate the item for least depth and survey position determinations, usually via a MBES system. In general, side scan imagery should be capable of positioning point features to an absolute accuracy of less than 10 meters. NOAA field units use various models of side scan sonar for hydrographic survey operations. For the purposes of this document, these systems will be treated as equivalent unless otherwise specified.\n1.5.7.1 Calibration Requirements and Methods\nSide scan sonar object detection and classification performance is largely a function of the original system specifications. To ensure that side scan sonar systems used for OCS surveys continue to perform adequately, hydrographers shall return all side scan systems to the regional EED depot for annual inspection and maintenance. If a towfish is equipped with a pressure sensor, this must be serviced and calibrated as part of the EED annual maintenance. If a towfish has been equipped with a transponder for locating the system if lost, new lithium batteries shall be installed and the system tested using an interrogator as part of annual maintenance.\n1.5.7.1.1 Offset Measurement and Verification\nSide scan system offsets must be measured and/or verified prior to performing a calibration. Depending upon whether the sonar configuration is hull-mounted or towed, requirements for offset measurements will vary. Offset requirements for each type of configuration are described below.\n1.5.7.1.1.1 Hull-Mounted SSS Configuration\nFor hull-mounted configurations, the phase center of the side scan shall be precisely positioned during the vessel static offsets survey. The phase center of the towfish is considered to be at the fore and aft midpoint of the transducers and on the centerline in the athwartships and vertical axes.\nWhen hull-mounting a SSS, particular attention must be paid to the alignment of the towfish with respect to the keel of the survey vessel, as a very small alignment error can introduce significant positioning errors in the data. For example, a heading alignment error of only 1\u00b0 will add 1.75 m horizontal positioning error at the edge of the swath on a 100-m range scale. In extreme cases, it may be necessary to measure alignment error with a yaw patch test, and enter a correction in the HVF. The field unit should contact the regional HSTP Field Support Liaison for assistance with this test, if needed.\n1.5.7.1.1.2 Towed SSS Configuration\nFor towed SSS operations, static vessel offsets should be measured to the towpoint. The actual towfish position is typically calculated using towfish depth and cable out measurements. Towfish depth may be determined by a depth sensor installed in the towfish or calculated by subtracting the towfish height (determined by a separate echosounder installed in the towfish or the first return of each sonar ping) from the depth of water (determined from a vessel echosounder). If a SSS is equipped with a pressure sensor, its accuracy should be tested annually and whenever the horizontal positioning accuracy of side scan targets is in doubt. Cable out can be estimated visually from calibrated markings on the cable or measured with an electronic cable counter. Each configuration is described below.\n28\n\n\fNote: When measuring cable out, the cable zero mark is not at its connection to the towfish, but at the phase center of the sonar.\n\u00b7 Marked Cable - Marked tow cables shall be measured using a survey grade metal tape and clearly marked. Cable markings shall be in meters and enable visual interpolation to a tenth of a meter. Since a cable jacketcan stretch and slide over the conductors during use, cable measurement markings shall be verified annually, and whenever the hydrographer believes they may be in error.\n\u00b7 Cable Counter - Electronic cable counters shall be configured according to the manufacturer's instructions. The hydrographer shall verify the accuracy of the cable counter by comparing manual and electronic cable measurements at a range of cable lengths. This check shall be conducted annually, whenever the counter, cable, or sheave configuration is changed, and whenever the hydrographer believes there may be a cable measurement error. Note: For some cable counters, the serial data output being logged may be in different units than what is shown on the cable counter display. In such cases, the hydrographer may need to perform a conversion on raw cable out data either prior to logging or during post-processing.\n1.5.7.1.2 SSS Calibration\nAs part of Annual Systems Preparation, the field unit shall demonstrate that all side scan sonar systems to be used for OCS hydrographic surveys are capable of meeting object detection standards set forth in section 6.1.2 of the HSSD. An operational SSS Calibration Test shall be conducted to demonstrate the system's ability to detect and accurately position seafloor targets across the system's range on both sonar channels. Test information shall be recorded in a SSS Calibration Table. An example of this table is provided in Appendix 1 (SSS_Cal_Table.pdf) with sample data entered in red font.\nThe SSS Calibration test shall consist of a minimum of 10 side scan passes on a target approximately 1 m x 1 m x 1 m. The target shall be imaged from a variety of ranges and directions, with survey speed, water depth, and weather representative of typical survey conditions. Although dedicated test targets can be used for this check, targets of opportunity, such as buoy blocks, lobster pots, and appropriately sized rocks, may be sufficient. The hydrographer should use alternate systems (e.g., MBES) to determine a high accuracy absolute position of the target for comparison with SSS detected positions.\nFigure 1.6 shows the OCS recommended line plan for conducting a SSS Calibration Test. Note that this line plan balances ensonifications on the port and starboard channels, across the range scale, from different target aspects, and from different directions. This approach assists the hydrographer in differentiating systematic and random errors in detection and positioning.\nFigure 1.6: Recommended line plan for SSS calibration testing. 29\n\n\fTest data shall be processed according to standard OCS hydrographic survey procedures and evaluated to identify any systematic problems with the sonar or vessel offsets. If the contact is not detected in more than one of the 10 passes, the SSS towfish should be carefully inspected for damage and the system re-tested. If detection remains problematic, the field unit shall contact EED and the regional HSTP Field Support Liaison for guidance.\nSuccessful object detections shall be used to compare the mean detected position with the absolute target position and to compute the approximate 95% Confidence Radius for the system. This radius should not exceed 5 meters for hull-mounted systems and 10 meters for towed systems. Several methods can be used to estimate the 95% Confidence Radius. A simple option is to plot the detected target positions in MapInfo, and use the \"Compute Statistics\" function to compute the sample standard deviation of the x and y components of the detection positions (computing statistics of the Eastings and Northings yields values in meters). Assuming a normal distribution, 95% of the samples will fall within 1.96 standard deviations of the mean. If the distribution of detections is similar in x and y, the 95% Confidence Radius is roughly 1.96 times the square root of the sum of the squares of the standard deviation of detected positions in x and y.\nIf the distributions in x and y are not similar, it is likely that a systematic bias exists that was not canceled by ensonifying the target from multiple ranges and directions.\nSimilar results can be obtained by measuring the error for each detection (the distance from the absolute target position to the detected position) and computing the sample mean and standard deviation of the errors. The approximate 95% Confidence Radius is then the sample mean plus 1.96 times the standard deviation.\n1.5.7.2 Periodic Quality Assurance Checks\nAt least one confidence check of a SSS system shall be conducted each day the system is used for data acquisition. These checks should be in accordance with section 6.1.3.1 of the HSSD and consist of detecting a discrete object at the outer range scale limits for each sonar channel (i.e., port and starboard). Confidence checks shall be annotated in the daily data acquisition records. If these confidence checks repeatedly show discrepancies with expected performance, a new System Calibration may need to be performed.\nBefore surveying with a SSS system that has been either reconfigured or in storage, a \"rub test\" should be performed. The rub test is a simple procedure wherein a hydrographer observes the SSS trace while an assistant physically rubs one transducer on the towfish and then the other while the system is pinging. As the assistant rubs the transducer, the hydrographer should see a return on the corresponding channel of the imagery. A rub test failure can indicate system errors such as incorrect gain or power settings, a faulty cable, or damaged transducers. This test should be conducted while the towfish is out of the water and dry, to avoid the possibility of electric shock.\nCaution: Do not leave a SSS towfish turned on for more than 5 minutes while out of the water. These are watercooled systems and can be damaged by excessive heat buildup if left on when not deployed.\n1.5.7.3 Documentation & Reporting Requirements\nIn addition to a SSS Calibration Table, a chartlet showing the test area, actual target position, test line plan, positions of successful detections, and approximate 95% Confidence Radius for the target location shall be created for each system tested. The exact format of these chartlets is left to the discretion of the hydrographer. This information shall be maintained by the field unit and available for review during Hydrographic Systems Reviews and at the request of OCS. Documentation for SSS Calibration Tests conducted shall be included with the DAPR for each associated project.\n30\n\n\fThere is no requirement to individually document and report SSS confidence checks required in section 1.5.7.2 above. Hydrographers shall verify that these checks were conducted, describe the results, and discuss any problems encountered in the Quality Control section of each applicable Descriptive Report.\n1.5.8 Tide Gauges\nTide gauges are used to measure water levels for calculating bathymetric data correctors. In any given tidal area, water level data account for the largest vertical correction to soundings. However, water levels vary due to both astronomical tides and effects from other forces such as wind, rain, barometric pressure, and freshwater runoff. Even in areas where tidal range is small, such as the Gulf of Mexico, the total water level variations can still be large enough to significantly affect sounding accuracy. If water level values are not properly measured and applied, then hydrographic error budget requirements may not be met.\n1.5.8.1 Calibration Requirements & Methods\nTide gauges, batteries, GOES antennas, battery cables, regulators, and other tide gauge equipment are typically maintained and calibrated (if necessary) by the Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (CO-OPS) staff on an annual basis. Field units should contact the local Operations Branch of the CO-OPS Field Operations Division immediately after the close of the field season to arrange for servicing of any gauges deployed with the unit. As the field unit prepares for the upcoming field season, the unit should discuss tide gauge requirements with FOD as soon as project assignments are known.\nField units should thoroughly test all tide gauge equipment, including that serviced by CO-OPS, as part of the Hydrographic Systems Readiness Review process.\n1.5.8.2 Periodic Quality Assurance Checks\nWhen a field unit installs a tide gauge for hydrographic surveys, it is responsible for operation and maintenance of that gauge for the duration of the survey. As such, it behooves the hydrographer to conduct a full functional check of all gauge equipment immediately prior to installation. Once the gauge is installed, the following checks should be conducted:\n\u00b7 The hydrographer should monitor the daily Hydro Hotlist email to ensure that gauge data are being received by CO-OPS and pass quality checks. (Note: the hydrographer must specifically request CO-OPS to add gauges to the Hydro Hotlist. See section 3.5.2.3.1 on page 86 for additional information.)\n\u00b7 If GOES transmissions are not possible from the tide station site, the hydrographer should visit the station every few days to ensure that data are being recorded. The hydrographer should download recorded data on these visits, check the water levels to ensure a smooth curve consistent with predictions (if available), and transmit the data to CO-OPS.\n\u00b7 Regardless of the status of the satellite uplink, the hydrographer should visit the station site approximately weekly to check the physical integrity of the installation. These checks should include the following:\n\u00b7 Confirm that gas pressure is adequate to last until the next visit, and check for gas leaks at tubing connections (for bubbler gauges).\n31\n\n\f\u00b7 Check battery voltage to confirm that the solar cells are providing adequate charging current.\n\u00b7 Check for physical stability of the gauge by performing a minimum of 2 hour of staff readings for comparison with recorded data.\n\u00b7 These station checks are particularly critical immediately before and after an extended absence from the survey area (such as a port call).\nIf problems are observed with water level data an on-site assessment should be conducted and field units should contact CO-OPS to determine the preferred course of action.\n1.5.8.3 Documentation and Reporting Requirements\nSince tide gauge equipment is maintained by CO-OPS, annual field unit calibrations are not required. Tide gauges do not need to be addressed during Hydrographic Systems Reviews aside from being listed in the Hardware Systems Inventory. Any tide gauge problems encountered during survey operations shall be described, including any subsequent effects to survey data, in applicable DAPRs or DRs.\n1.5.9 Leveling Equipment\nGeodetic leveling equipment is used to measure elevation differences between benchmark locations and to extend vertical control from established benchmarks to water level measuring equipment or a water level staff. For hydrographic survey operations, this equipment consists of a compensator leveling instrument and level rod. The quality of the vertical datum measured is partially dependent on the quality of the leveling performed between benchmarks and the water level staff or equipment. It is important to properly maintain leveling instruments and rods to ensure that they are within calibration tolerances.\nIt is OCS policy to follow the standards and procedures established by CO-OPS for calibrating and operating leveling equipment used to survey water level stations. These requirements are described in the NOS User's Guide for the Installation of Bench Marks and Leveling Requirements for Water Level Stations, published by CO-OPS and included on the Hydrosoft website. These requirements are summarized here, but the hydrographer should refer to the User's Guide for specific information on leveling operations.\n1.5.9.1 Calibration Requirements & Methods\nFor OCS hydrographic survey operations, level surveys shall be conducted to at least third order accuracy standards. The minimum scale calibration standard for level rods being used for third order surveys is the manufacturer's standard. Level rods do not have a recommended time period between scale calibrations. If an error is suspected in a rod scale, the rod may be calibrated and certified by an approved laboratory.\nNo leveling instrument is perfectly aligned. The angle from which the line of sight departs from the actual level surface when the instrument is leveled is referred to as collimation error. To minimize collimation error, the leveling instrument shall be serviced and adjusted during Annual Systems Preparation and whenever a collimation error cannot be reduced to acceptable tolerances in the field. This service shall be performed by a qualified, manufacturer-approved technician.\n32\n\n\fThe hydrographer shall verify the collimation of leveling instruments after annual calibration. Collimation shall be checked according to either of the two approved methods described in section 3 of the User's Guide. The collimation error should be no greater than \u00b1 0.05 mm/m. If it exceeds this tolerance, the level instrument must be adjusted and another check performed. Collimation Checks shall be processed and documented on NOAA Form 75-29 (or an equivalent) according to the procedure and example in section 3 of the User's Guide.\n1.5.9.2 Periodic Quality Assurance Checks\nCollimation and general performance of leveling equipment shall be verified prior to each leveling survey by repeating the collimation check. If collimation error exceeds \u00b1 0.05 mm/m, the level instrument must be adjusted and another check made until the error can be successfully reduced below this threshold.\n1.5.9.3 Documentation and Reporting Requirements\nCollimation check and calibration records for leveling equipment used for OCS hydrographic surveys shall be maintained by the field unit and available for review during Hydrographic Systems Reviews and at the request of OCS. Leveling equipment and dates of calibration shall be reported in the Hydrographic Systems Inventory. Documentation for any subsequent collimation checks and/or calibrations conducted shall be included in the DAPR for each applicable project.\n1.5.10 Horizontal & Vertical Control Equipment\nNo standard calibration requirements have been implemented at this time for horizontal and vertical control equipment. This equipments calibration requirements and quality assurance checks should be maintained per the manufacturer's recommendations until further guidance is provided.\n1.5.10.1 Documentation & Reporting Requirements\nNote: Calibration and quality assurance documentation for horizontal and vertical control equipment used for hydrographic surveying shall be maintained by the field unit and available for review during Hydrographic Systems Reviews and at the request of OCS. Horizontal and vertical control equipment and dates of calibration (if applicable) shall be reported in the Hydrographic Systems Inventory. Documentation for any subsequent calibrations or quality assurance checks conducted shall be included in the DAPR for each applicable project.\n1.5.11 Reference Surface\nOnce all sonar and ancillary instrument calibrations have been performed, field parties shall assess the combined effects of vessel offsets, patch test biases, and sonar bottom detection for each vessel-sounder combination by comparing data and grids over a known reference surface. This is a capstone of the system preparation process, as it combines the data from all constituent systems for an assessment of the final result.\nIn the event there is only one vessel and sensor, a comparison should be made with another field unit or data from previous years if possible. If there is no previous coverage readily available, a self-comparison of reference surfaces shall be conducted. Self-comparisons cannot be used to check for overall vertical biases, but are useful for checking for other data anomalies.\n33\n\n\fNote: this section assumes testing of multibeam echsounders. However, testing vertical beam echosounder systems over a multbeam reference surface can also provide useful results.\nField units are encouraged to collaborate in establishing and using reference surfaces. Ideally, these would be located in an area to which field units could return annually or as needed, with all datasets centrally archived for future comparison.\n\n1.5.11.1 Reference Surface Acquisition and Processing\n\nA grid pattern (shown in Figure 1.7) should be acquired with each sonar-vessel combination for a robust comparison:\n\n\u00b7\n\nThe grid should be planned over a relatively flat area of depth appropriate for the sonar under\n\nevaluation. (It may be helpful if the test area includes a few discrete features such as wrecks or\n\nrocks, but this is not required.)\n\n\u00b7\n\nSurvey lines should be planned for at least 100% coverage in each direction, leading to ~200%\n\ncoverage over the entire grid.\n\n\u00b7\n\nThe reference surface should be sized to produce a minimum of approximately five million\n\nsoundings per echosounder head. This is necessary to provide a statistically significant sample\n\nsize for each beam of the sonar. Larger surfaces will typically improve analysis results, but\n\nobviously at the expense of acquisition and processing time.\n\n\u00b7\n\nSonars should be operated (vessel speed, system settings) as they would ordinarily be for\n\nstandard survey operations in the area.\n\n\u00b7\n\nSettings (beam type-EA/ED, power, gain, pulse width, absorption, spreading) should be the same\n\nfor the comparative systems, but may differ for different frequencies of the same sonar. For\n\nexample, for the Reson7125, the 200kHz may have settings that differ from the 400kHz system.\n\n\u00b7\n\nAll necessary data correctors such as delayed heave, tide, sound speed, and TPU shall be\n\nacquired and applied to the data. Incorporating the techniques of Ellipsoidally-Referenced Sur\n\nveys (ERS), in addition to traditional tides, can help minimize errors associated with water levels.\n\n\u00b7\n\nBackscatter data should be acquired concurrent with bathymetry data.\n\n\u00b7\n\nIdeally, all of a field unit's sonar-vessel combinations should be tested in reasonably quick\n\nsuccession to limit influence of environmental changes.\n\n34\n\n\fFigure 1.7 \u00ad Sample reference surface acquisition plan. A 200% coverage scheme was employed over a site which displayed a mixture of flat bottom, sand waves, and targets (buoy blocks).\n\nOnce gross fliers have been removed, the data for each unique vessel/sonar combination should be gridded using CUBE at the highest resolution at which the dataset can support a minimum of five soundings per node (ideally, twice the maximum standard required survey resolution for the depth of the test area, i.e. 2.5% water depth). In addition, the backscatter should be mosaicked at appropriate resolution. A number of tests are now advised, including:\n\n\u00b7\n\nVisually check each surface for any data artifacts, especially those associated with offset issues,\n\npoor patch test values, timing errors, or incorrect motion stabilization application.\n\n\u00b7\n\nAssess the computed total propagated uncertainty and standard deviation of each reference\n\nsurface, comparing these uncertainty estimates to IHO thresholds.\n\n\u00b7\n\nCompute difference surfaces to compare the surfaces of different vessel/sonar combinations\n\nacquired at roughly the same time (consider performing these differences with data referenced to\n\nboth tidal and ellipsoidal reference frames). Compare the difference values with the estimated\n\nuncertainty for each of the comparison grids, and the IHO thresholds. (This tests inter-system\n\nagreement).\n\n\u00b7\n\nCompute difference surfaces to compare each vessel/sonar combination with results from the\n\nsame combination from previous years (again, consider performing these differences with\n\ndata refer enced to both tidal and ellipsoidal reference frames). Compare the difference\n\nvalues with the estimated uncertainty for each of the comparison grids, and the IHO thresholds.\n\n\u00b7\n\nPerform a beam-by-beam statistical comparison of the processed soundings against the reference\n\ngrid composed of the same data. The HIPS beam-by-beam analysis tool may be the most\n\n35\n\n\fappropriate method. Examine results for beam-specific biases or noise. (This tests internal-con sistency of the sonar, and helps identify faulty segments of the transducer or beamformer).\n\n\u00b7\n\nAs an alternative or in addition to the beam-by-beam comparison, two separate surfaces at lower\n\nresolution (one from each 100% coverage) can be created, and differenced. (This will help\n\nassess internal consistency of the data, but will not highlight problem segments of a sonar swath).\n\n\u00b7\n\nBackscatter analysis is more qualitative, but assessments may include visual assessment of the\n\nmosaic for any obvious artifacts which could be associated with a sonar malfunction, inter-\n\nsystem comparison, and year-to-year comparison of backscatter acquired with the same sonar-\n\nvessel system.\n\n1.5.11.2 Periodic Qualify Assurance Checks\nReference surfaces and associated data analysis should be performed as part of any new sonar-vessel system commissioning, and at least annually as part of the Hydrographic System Readiness Review. Additional tests may be advisable after significant changes to the sonar-vessel system, or if any data qualify concerns emerge from standard survey data.\n\n1.5.11.3 Reporting Requirements\n\nAs the reference surface test is a capstone of the overall Hydrographic System Readiness Review (HSRR) Process, any results which indicate concerns in the overall health of the sonar-vessel system(s) shall be discussed in the HSRR Memo.\n\nA fuller description of reference surface process and results shall be included in the DAPR as an attachment. The exact format is left to the discretion of the hydrographer, but it should include the following:\n\n\u00b7\n\nDescription of the reference surface area in sufficient detail to allow other units to utilize the\n\nsame location\n\n\u00b7\n\nA full description of the system combination tested\n\n\u00b7\n\nA brief description of data acquisition and processing, including discussion of any problems en\n\ncountered or non-standard procedures followed\n\n\u00b7\n\nResults and discussion of the comparison tests performed\n\n\u00b7\n\nAny recommendations\n\nThe following is an example discussion of Reference Surfaces from NOAA Ship Rainier:\n\nAs an example, part of the Rainier's HSRR process involves creating nine reference surfaces for the purposes of calibrating their four survey launches (with their nine associated transducers).\" One sonar is arbitrarily declared the \"baseline\", and all surfaces are then differenced from this baseline (Figure 1.8). Once these differences are known, statistics are generated, visualized and appropriately interpreted (Figure 1.9). In the example shown in Figure 1.9 all three sonars mounted to Launch 2803 (green) exhibited a 6-7cm bias as compared to the other ves-\n36\n\n\fsels (when referenced to MLLW); a bias that was mitigated when comparisons were instead made on the ellipse. This knowledge then informs the HSRR team to examine the parameters of Launch 2803 that are unique to the MLLW workflow (i.e. Dynamic Draft, Static Draft, Loading, Tides or Heave). In this case, it was an erroneous dynamic draft model due to the characteristics of the suspended 8125 sonar unique to the design of Launch 2803. Once analysis is complete, all the systems could then be condensed into a master reference surface which can be used as the baseline in future HSRRs.\nFigure 1.8 \u00ad Tabulated differences of all sonars (2801 HF considered baseline) conducted during a single HSRR process, referenced to both MLLW and the Ellipse.\nFigure 1.9 \u00ad Graphical display of the relative differences of nine sonars' reference surfaces, referenced to both MLLW and the Ellipse. 37\n\n\f1.6 Software Systems\nComputer software plays an essential role in NOAA's hydrographic surveying operations and must be managed with care and attention to detail. It is important that each field unit ensure during the Annual Systems Preparation, that their systems are up-to-date with the most current approved versions of survey related software.\nField units shall operate with the most up-to-date software available; any mid-season software changes should be carefully documented so that the field unit can revert to a prior software version if problems arise. OCS has established the following basic guidelines for maintaining, updating and testing software.\nAll field units should incorporate adequate computer and software maintenance periods into their annual schedules. This should be planned to coincide with a period of relatively low operational activity, typically winter inport for ships. Field units should use this opportunity to install and configure software on new computer systems and conduct comprehensive rebuilds of systems to be retained. In general, \"rebuilding\" a system entails the following steps:\n1. Back-up all storage devices attached to the system (local hard drives).\n2. Reformat storage devices.\n3. Complete any scheduled hardware upgrades (new drives, memory, etc.).\n4. Load the latest approved version of the operating system and mission software (standardized to the greatest extent possible across the platform).\n5. Restore only essential data from the back-up.\nThis practice has been particularly useful on Microsoft Windows-based systems with multiple users, as it enforces software and configuration standardization and limits retention of unnecessary data or software that may adversely affect system performance.\nNOAA personnel seeking information on hydrographic software updates should consult HSTP. HSTP is the first point of contact for most commercial hydrographic software packages in use by NOAA hydrographic field units and is directly responsible for writing and maintaining many of the in-house programs used for OCS surveys. Prior to installing software upgrades, it should be ascertained that the new version or update has been tested and approved for use. The field unit's regional HSTP Field Support Liaison should be able to answer questions about software availability and testing.\nAboard NOAA hydrographic survey ships, EED shares responsibility for maintenance of hydrographic survey computer systems and software. Traditionally, EED has maintained computer hardware, operating systems, and data acquisition software, while OCS has been responsible for survey planning and data processing software, but these lines are often blurred. Shipboard hydrographers should, therefore, coordinate all software requests and changes with the embarked Electronics Technician, as well as with HSTP.\nThere will be cases where a critical software problem warrants installation of an upgrade before HSTP or EED has rigorously tested and/or verified its functionality. Hydrographers are encouraged and expected to exercise common sense in these cases. If external testing is not possible, field units should establish an internal software test program, document the procedures and results, and report their findings to HSTP and EED, so other units can benefit from their experience.\n38\n\n\f1.6.1 Types of Software Systems\n\n1.6.1.1 Computer Operating Systems (OSS)\n\nThe operating system is a computer's most fundamental software and it affects the performance of all other programs running on a machine. Typically, NOAA's hydrographic survey computer systems use the Microsoft Windows environment. New versions or significant updates (such as Service Packs) for any OS should not be installed until the hydrographer has consulted both EED and HSTP. These groups must confirm that mission critical software has been successfully tested under the proposed new OS version prior to installation on any system used for hydrographic survey operations. OCS discourages major mid-season OS upgrades (for example, switching from Windows XP to Windows 7 ) and suggests that field units attempt to maintain a standard OS on all data acquisition and processing systems.\n\nOCS will not notify field units of available OS upgrades unless the update is critical to maintain functionality or compatibility with hydrographic systems. However, most OS vendors have an automatic notification system for critical updates. Field units with Internet access can also check the OS vendors' websites to determine if updates are available. Complete OS upgrades should be acquired through EED (if shipboard) or via the field unit's chain of command.\n\n1.6.1.2 Data Acquisition Sofware\n\nSofware Packages\n\nManufacturer\n\nCommon NOAA Uses\n\nHypackMAX\n\nHYPACK\n\nVBES and MBES acquisition; survey line navigation\n\nSonarPro\n\nKlien\n\nSSS acquisition\n\nSIS\n\nKongsberg\n\nMBES acquisition\n\nPOSVIEW\n\nTrimble/Applanix\n\nPOS MV settings, lever arms and logging (POSPAC) control\n\nDiscover II\n\nEdgeTech\n\nSSS acquisition\n\nTable 1.1: Common OCS Data Acquisition Software Packages.\n\nOCS recommends that data acquisition software updates be performed during Annual Systems Preparation. Field units wishing to install updates during normal operational periods shall contact the regional HSTP Field Support Liaison to determine if the new version has been successfully tested in a controlled environment. Occasionally, it may be necessary to install a critical update without prior HSTP testing. In such cases, field units should first document the existing software version settings so that it can be reinstalled if the update causes more severe problems. The software upgrade should then be installed on a limited basis to minimize the effects of any bugs encountered. Proper testing of new software may require several days of standard field operations to fully assess its functionality. Field units should process and thoroughly examine resulting data for errors prior to making a unit-wide installation.\n\nHSTP maintains support agreements with most manufacturers of data acquisition software packages used by OCS. Although some companies may contact individual licensees directly when updates are available, this communication is typically routed through HSTP or EED. When a period of relative inactivity suitable for computer system maintenance is approaching, field units should contact the regional HSTP Field Support Liaison and assigned EED Electronics Technician (if applicable) for any approved data acquisition software upgrades that are available.\n\n39\n\n\f1.6.1.3 Data Processing Software\nData processing software are those programs used to manipulate and analyze survey data. Common hydrographic data processing software packages used by NOAA field units are presented in Table 1.2. Downloads for software and updates can typically be found at the following HSTP maintained Hydrosoft site https://inside.nos.noaa.gov/hydrosoft/welcome.html\n\nSofware Package\n\nManufacturer\n\nCommon OCS Uses\n\nHIPS / SIPS\n\nCARIS\n\nbathymetry and imagery data processing\n\nNotebook\n\nCARIS\n\nsurvey planning and processing\n\nMapInfo\n\nMapInfo\n\nsurvey planning; survey product creation\n\nFledermaus\n\nIVS - 3D\n\n3D survey data visualization\n\nPydro\n\nNOAA\n\nsurvey data analysis; report creation; TCARI tide application\n\nVelocipy\n\nNOAA\n\nsound velocity profile processing; variability wedge analysis, est. sound speed uncertainty\n\nHydro MI\n\nNOAA\n\nsurvey line planning; tide file creation\n\nPOSPac\n\nTrimble/Applanix\n\nderive IAPPK solution to hydrographic data\n\nOPUS\n\nNGS\n\nhigh accuracy positioning\n\nInverse 3D\n\nNGS\n\nPPK processing\n\nVDatum\n\nNOAA\n\nconversion from different horizontal/vertical references into a common system\n\nTable 1.2: Common OCS Data Processing Software Packages\n\nHSTP maintains software support agreements with most data processing software manufacturers, many of which notify users directly when new updates are available. The following update procedures for specific processing software packages have been established by OCS:\n\n\u00b7 CARIS products: All NOAA hydrographic field units should be receiving weekly email from CARIS describing any new releases. Any field units not subscribed to this service should contact the regional HSTP Field Support Liaison to register.\n\n\u00b7 HSTP products (Pydro, Hydro_MI, Velocipy): HSTP will notify field units directly when critical updates are available.\n\n\u00b7 IVS 3D: Units interested in receiving email notification of Fledermaus updates can subscribe to the IVS email list. See http://www.qps.nl/display/fledermaus/support for more information.\n\n\u00b7 MapInfo: All MapInfo licenses are covered under a global maintenance plan managed by HSTP. HSTP will notify field units directly when critical MapInfo updates or patches are available.\n\n\u00b7 POSPac: HSTP will notify field units directly when critical updates become available.\n\n\u00b7 OPUS: OPUS is not available as a standalone program, but can be found online at http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/ OPUS/\n\n40\n\n\f\u00b7 NGS INVERSE3D; NGS INVERSE3D can be used to perform the weekly position uncertainty check base stations and can be downloaded at http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/TOOLS/Inv_Fwd/Inv_Fwd.html.\n\u00b7 VDatum: VDatum software is developed jointly by the NOS Tri-Office VDatum Team. VDatum transformations utilize a combination of stepwise transformations between ellipsoidal, orthometric, and tidal datums, leveraging the best available hydrodynamic models and historical tidal and geodetic data at each step. VDatum software can be downloaded at http://vdatum.noaa.gov/.\n1.6.1.4 Support Software\nSupport software includes any packages that are used as part of the hydrographic survey process, but do not directly interact with data. However, they may be used to create digital products that accompany survey data and, as such, must be compatible with systems throughout OCS. Examples of support software that may be in use by a field unit include NOAA Chart Reprojector, Paint Shop Pro or AutoCAD.\nAlthough OCS does not notify field units of upgrades to these packages unless there is a pressing operational need, most vendors provide email update notification to registered users. Field units should coordinate with OCS to ensure that support software is in compliance with NOAA standards and compatible with survey systems.\n1.6.2 Software Repositories\nOnce a field unit has determined that a software upgrade is approved, available, and desirable, the digital files must be acquired. While some vendors will provide these upgrades on physical media, users are often expected to download updates via File Transfer Protocol (FTP) or from Internet websites. HSTP posts both commercial and in-house software upgrades to OCS's anonymous FTP server (IP address 205.156.4.84). Note: NOAA field units can not upload data to the FTP server.\nIf field units are outfitted with reliable high speed Internet access, software can be easily downloaded from vendor sites or the FTP server. However, some of NOAA's hydrographic field units have limited bandwidth for accessing the Internet or for receiving email attachments; thus, an alternate means of obtaining software upgrades may be necessary. Field units should consider other connection sites, such as public libraries or Internet caf\u00e9s, or contact the regional HSTP Field Support Liaison to have updates mailed on CD or other media.\n1.6.3 Documentation & Reporting Requirements\nEach computer used to acquire or manipulate hydrographic survey data shall be included on the Software Inventory portion of the Hydrographic Systems Inventory. Installations and updates for primary software packages shall be recorded for each computer, as shown by the sample data (red font) included on the Software Inventory spreadsheet. Additionally, a record of system settings for hydrographic data acquisition software shall be created and updated throughout the field season. If a software system has the capability to output a file identifying all configuration settings, a copy of this file will meet system settings reporting requirements. Otherwise, the field unit will need to manually generate a digital record (e.g., a spreadsheet). Software documentation shall be maintained by the field unit and available for review during Hydrographic Systems Reviews and at the request of OCS. A copy of the Software Inventory and system settings records in effect during operations shall be included in the DAPR for each respective project.\n41\n\n\f1.7 Personnel Rosters\nPeople are the most essential component of any hydrographic survey system, and training hydrographic personnel is a critical element of survey preparation for any field unit. Even if all hardware and software systems are functioning correctly, data quality and operational efficiency will suffer without properly qualified hydrographers. Guidelines for training and qualification of hydrographic personnel are described below.\nFor the purposes of this manual, \"hydrographic personnel\" are defined as those members of a field unit's complement (permanent or temporary duty) whose normal duties include responsibility for any activities that directly affect survey planning, data acquisition, or data processing. In addition to Physical Scientists, Survey Technicians, Commissioned Officers, and others in immediate control of survey operations, this includes launch coxswains and Officers of the Deck (OODs) responsible for operating vessels during surveying; visitors who participate in data acquisition and processing without direct supervision; and the unit's command. Support personnel, such as marine engineers, stewards, and members of the deck department not acting as launch coxswains, are not typically considered \"hydrographic personnel\". However, if survey operations will be significantly impacted by any of the aforementioned groups, e.g. an insufficient number of engineers to perform planned 24-hour operations, these situations should be mentioned in the Hydrographic Systems Readiness Memo described in section 1.1.1 .\n1.7.1 Personnel Qualifications & Training\nStandard hydrographic training and qualification requirements are not currently established for NOAA's hydrographic personnel. Therefore, it is incumbent on each field unit to establish internal standards to ensure that hydrographic personnel are adequately qualified to safely and efficiently accomplish the unit's mission. Such a program of training and qualification can be crafted from any of several available components including, but not limited to, the following:\n1.7.1.1 Internal Training and Qualification Standards\nThese are standards of training and qualification developed by the field unit to meet the particular needs of its configuration and mission. Examples include:\n\u00b7 Launch Hydrographer-in-Charge (HIC) workbook and qualification\n\u00b7 Launch Person-in-Charge (PIC) workbook and qualification\n\u00b7 Launch Coxswain workbook and qualification\n\u00b7 Officer Of the Deck (OOD) workbook and qualification\n1.7.1.2 NOAA Hydrographic Training\nThe Office of Coast Survey organizes an annual basic hydrographic training program (\"Hydrotraining\"). One session per year is offered at a location on each coast, typically Norfolk, VA and Seattle, WA, and all new survey personnel are encouraged to attend. Subject to demand and available funding, sessions on advanced topics suitable for hydrographers with more than one year of experience may also be offered in conjunction with the basic course.\n42\n\n\fCO-OPS is available to provide training on basic tidal theory, tide gauge installation, discrete tide zoning and TCARI methodology. Elements of these topics are covered in basic Hydrotraining, but field units may choose to schedule additional training with CO-OPS to meet their specific needs. 1.7.1.3 External Training Hydrographers may be eligible to pursue hydrographic qualifications from an outside agency or organization such as the American Congress on Surveying and Mapping (ACSM). 1.7.2 Reporting Requirements Although the Hydrographic Systems Inventory includes only a basic roster of hydrographic personnel, deficiencies in either numbers or qualification of personnel should be noted in the Hydrographic Systems Readiness Memo described in section 1.1.1 Additionally, OCS recommends that each field unit maintain a record of personnel training and qualifications. Formally documenting personnel training and qualifications will assist Chiefs-of-Party in assessing the readiness of their personnel. This record can also help identify hydrographic training needs, enabling units to request and allocate resources accordingly. Copies of curriculum and/or requirements for any internally crafted qualification or training should be maintained by the field unit for reference purposes.\n1.8 Data Storage Availability\nAn inventory of all available data storage shall be completed and documented as part of the HSRR.\n43\n\n\fChapter 2\nPre-Survey Planning\nPre-survey planning is essential for any field unit to effectively and efficiently conduct hydrographic survey operations. When planning operations, the hydrographer must keep in mind the assigned survey specifications and approved methods for meeting those criteria. This Chapter describes information that will be provided to a field unit when a hydrographic survey is assigned and provides project preparation and survey planning guidance.\n2.1 Crew & Vessel Safety\nAbove all, every member of the field party should understand that safety of the crew and vessel is the number one priority. Safety shall be the foremost consideration in all aspects of Office of Coast Survey (OCS hydrographic surveys, from the planning stages through data submission. It is the responsibility of the Chief-of-Party, as well as vessel crew, to be aware of safety hazards and take steps necessary to ensure undue risks are avoided, even if it means ceasing operations. Good planning and information can minimize risks associated with hydrographic surveying. Recommended practices to increase safety include, but are not limited to the following:\n\u00b7 Use historical weather information to prepare for seasonal patterns. \u00b7 Review the survey region for exposed areas, constricted areas, shallow areas, surf, etc. Plan on surveying\nchallenging areas when weather, tides, and currents are optimal. \u00b7 Review prior survey Descriptive Reports (DR) and smooth sheets for uncharted hazards. Often, the DR will\ndescribe deficiencies, hazards, and challenges from prior surveys and field experience. \u00b7 Work progressively from safe water towards unknown, shallow, or potentially hazardous areas. \u00b7 Use daily survey information progressively in the field to minimize hazards. Communicate survey and safety\ninformation to all personnel involved in operations. ` Read the Automated Wreck and Obstruction Information System (AWOIS) features included with the project files descriptions to understand hazards and survey the feature project area safely. Understand the limitations of charted and source information and approach features conservatively during initial operations.\n44\n\n\f2.2 The Project CD/DVD\nWhen a hydrographic survey is assigned, the HSD Operations Branch (OPS), or the NSD Navigation Response Branch (NRB) if the unit is an NRT, will generate and compile relevant project information onto a Project CD/ DVD. This information will include project instructions, as well as supporting information and data files to be used during field operations and subsequent survey processing. Copies of the Project CD/DVD will be disseminated to the appropriate field unit six weeks prior to the start of the project. The file structure illustrated in Figure 2.1 represents that of a typical Project CD/DVD. If a folder is intentionally left empty, the project planner will place in a readme.txt file indicating as such.\nFigure 2.1: Project DVD Structure\n45\n\n\f2.2.1 Hydrographic Survey Project Instructions\nThe Hydrographic Survey Project Instructions will identify specific requirements for a survey project. Project Instructions will be included on the Project CD/DVD and can be equated to a Requirements Document or Statement of Work. Field units shall acknowledge receipt of Project Instructions via email to the assigned OPS Project Manager or the NRB Technical Assistant.\n2.2.2 Supporting Project Information\nExtensive supporting project information will be provided on the Project CD/DVD. The following items are included: Consults folder containing relevant project correspondence, project GIS Files, Junction Surveys, Prior Surveys, and preliminary tidal zoning files. The naming conventions for project information files generated at OPS or NRB will reference the applicable project number or survey sheet number.\n2.2.2.1 Consults\nOCS, as a unit of a federal agency, has responsibilities under section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA, 16 U.S.C. 470 et seq.) to take into account the effects of its undertakings on historic properties. The process for federal agencies in complying with the NHPA is laid out in 36 C.F.R. Part 800, which prescribes consultation with the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO). In addition, OCS may consult with other NOAA offices or governmental agencies, depending on jurisdiction. The Hydrographic Surveys Division is responsible for conducting the entire consultation process. Correspondence and documentation relating to consultations with these Historic Preservation Points of Contact (HPPOCs) will be included in the Consults folder as background information for the field units.\nAny additional relevant project correspondence will be included in this folder.\n2.2.2.2 GIS Files\nThis folder will include the Composite Source File, MapInfo Sheet Limits, Maritime Boundary Point(s) Document, the Project Reference File, and Aids to Navogation Records.\nThe OPS Project Manager or NRB Technical Assistant will compile all available shoreline source files into one \"composite source\" file (CSF) in S-57 .000 format. Shoreline source files include: ENC, RNC, Geographic Cells (GCs \u00ad also labeled as DCFF ), and Lidar files. Compilation will include reviewing the CSF to determine which shoreline features shall be verified by the field unit. Features requiring verification shall have the attribute Assignment (asgnmt) populated with \"Assigned\".\nThe MapInfo sheets .tab will be provided to identify the planned area of hydrography for each project.\nLayouts for Field Examinations (FEs) will vary according to the item, feature, or area to be surveyed. Any MapInfo tables created by the OPS Project Manager or NRB Technical Assistant will be projected in Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) using the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83).\nA Project Reference File (PRF) will also be delivered with the CSF. The PRF is an S-57 attributed dataset containing reference layers such as survey limits, junctions, recommended bottom sample locations and features which are specifically targeted for investigation such as AWOIS points or Maritime Boundary points.\n46\n\n\fThe project wide AWOIS items are assigned to the field unit for investigation by the OPS Project Manager or the NRB Technical Assistant. This subset of the master AWOIS database will contain all items falling within the limits of the particular project, as well as any critical items in close proximity to the survey area.\nAWOIS items are represented as placeholders by the S-57 Feature Object CRANES. The AWOIS radii are represented by the S-57 Feature Object ACHBRT. The AWOIS search radii are assigned based upon extensive research of historical documents and factors such as the original source of the feature and the quality of that feature's positioning.\nPrescribed investigation requirements for each AWOIS item will be specified in the NOAA Extended Attributes (see section 8.2 of HSSD for details).\nAll AWOIS items included in the project area are \"assigned\" for verification (asgnmt = \"Assigned\"). In addition, the project planner may \"assign\" AWOIS items outside of the project area.\nThere are two types of AWOIS verification:\n1. AWOIS items which have not been verified in the past (Item Status = \"Assigned\", Search Type = \"Full\" or \"Limited\") \u00ad investigation includes verifying or disproving the item by covering the entire search radius regardless of location with respect to survey limits.\n2. AWOIS items which have been verified in prior surveys (Item Status = \"Completed\", Search Type = \"Information\") \u00ad no search radius is required. Investigation includes verifying or disproving the feature just as any other feature within the project area is verified or disproved. A search outside of the survey limits is not required (i.e. items inshore of the NALL).\nSee section 7.3 of the HSSD for further information on AWOIS items.\nIf shoreline verification is not required, there will be no CSF however all projects will contain a PRF containing a minimum of the survey limits.\nNOAA's Update Service Branch (USB) within the Marine Chart Division will review NOAA's Critical Corrections Database (CRIT) and/or USCG Integrated Aids to Navigation Information System (IATONIS) database to identify ATONs within the survey area that require positioning. Records for each assigned ATON will be provided by USB for inclusion on the Project CD/DVD. ATON records will include the current database position for each assigned ATON, position accuracies or positioning methods that were used (if available), and any special positioning requirements.\n2.2.2.3 Junction Surveys\nAssigned surveys may include a junction with contemporary data from a recent field season and all field units are required to ensure continuity in survey coverage and depth by evaluating junctioning or overlapping surveys. The Project Instructions will indicate if a junctioning survey is in a projection and datum other than UTM NAD83 and requires a datum conversion or reprojection.\n47\n\n\f2.2.2.3.1 Junctioning with Light Detection and Ranging (Lidar) Surveys\nLidar junction data will be provided in S-57 (.000 or .HOB) format on the Project CD/DVD. Features found by the Lidar survey will be added to the Composite Source File (CSF) as an existing feature. Lidar investigations will be added to the Project Reference File (PRF). Field units should obtain the required coverage type to the Lidar extent line or the Navigation Area Limit Line (NALL), whichever is further offshore. The standard practice for coverage overlap between Lidar and MB surveys is to overlap one swath width inshore of the LGL. Verify or disprove all Lidar investigation items seaward of the NALL.\nThe following files will be included on the Project CD/DVD for junctioning with Lidar data.\n\nFile Name\n\nDescription\n\nHxxxxx_LI_BASE_3m\n\n3 meter resolution surface.\n\nTable 2.2: CARIS file included on the Project CD/DVD for junctioning with Lidar data.\n\nFile Name\n\nDescription\n\nHxxxxx_DR.pdf\n\nDescriptive report and Appendices.\n\nTable 2.3: Other files included on Project CD/DVD for junctioning with Lidar\n\nThe following common attributes are used to define feature objects in the deliverables.\n\nAttribute\n\nDescription\n\nNINFOM\n\nRemarks and description of the feature.\n\nTable 2.5: Object attributes used in HOB files for junctioning with Lidar data.\n\nFor more information about the inclusion and treatment of Lidar items in the Composite Source, refer to section 2.2.1 and 3.5.5.1 .\n\n2.2.2.4 Prior Surveys\nThe Project CD/DVD will include the Descriptive Report raster images of the smooth sheet, features and soundings (in .000 format) for all available prior surveys in the assigned area.\n\n2.2.2.5 Survey Request Information\nThe OPS Project Manager or the NRB Technical Assistant will include, if available, copies of documents from the maritime community, research groups, or other entity requesting the survey on the Project CD/DVD.\n2.2.2.6 Tides\nThe Project CD/DVD will identify vertical control requirements for a project. Vertical Requirements which are further explained in sections2.4.4 & 3.5.2 , could consist of traditional tidal zoning, TCARI, VDatum, constant separation value, or ellipsoidally referenced zoned tides (ERZT). The Project Instructions will explicitly list any required subordinate tide gauges. A VDatum or constant separation file to correct soundings from the ellipsoid to chart datum will be provided on the project CD/DVD. For ERS vertical datum QC procedures, refer to chapter 9 of the HSSD.\n48\n\n\fThe NOAA Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (CO-OPS) provides three basic types of water level data, \"predicted tides,\" \"preliminary water levels\" and \"verified water levels\" referenced to MLLW or other appropriate chart datum. All of this data can be downloaded from the CO-OPS website. Typically, CO-OPS posts preliminary water level data within a few hours of data acquisition. Stations included on the Hydro Hotlist (see section 3.5.2.3.1 are processed weekly and verified water level data is typically available at the start of the following work week. Verified tides can be downloaded from the CO-OPS Data Retrieval website: http://opendap.co-ops.nos.noaa.gov/axis/text.html\nThe CO-OPS Hydro Planning Team (HPT) also supplies discrete zoning or TCARI to estimate water levels across the entire survey area where the water level characteristics may vary from those where tide gauges are located. Historical water level station information, including the location of each station site, benchmark description and elevations, and historical datum references will also be provided if historical tide stations need to be reoccupied.\nPredicted tides using 6-min format will be supplied on the Project CD/DVD.\n2.2.2.7 Orthoimagery\nThe hydrographer may request orthoimagery for a project if considered necessary to support pre-survey planning and post processing. Examples may (but are not limited to) include areas where there are drastic differences from the shoreline features in the CSF to the real world features. In these cases the hydrographer should contact the project planner from HSD or NRB which is listed in the project instructions to request approved orthoimagery. The project planner will work with the HSD OPS Team Lead and RSD to acquire the approved orthoimagery if available. Note: Orthoimagery is for reference only and shall not be used as source for surveying (i.e. digitizing features from orthoimagery is not allowed).\n2.3 Additional Resources\nAlthough the majority of information required to conduct an OCS hydrographic survey will be provided on the Project CD/DVD, additional resources such as training or reference materials may be necessary throughout a field unit's operating season.\n2.3.1 Hydrosoft Website\nThe Hydrosoft website, https://inside.nos.noaa.gov/hydrosoft/welcome.html, is maintained by OCS's Hydrographic Systems and Technology Program (HSTP) and provides an extensive amount of reference materials to the field. A Site Download option will be made available at the beginning of each field season to download the entire Hydrosoft website via a zip file. Additionally, the Recent Updates page lists all the changes that have been made in reverse chronological order.\n49\n\n\fThe following types of materials can be found on the Hydrosoft Website: \u00b7 Common survey software packages and applications, both commercial and in-house. \u00b7 Software and hardware manuals and guides. \u00b7 NOAA hydrographic training presentations and resources. \u00b7 Nautical and navigation reference materials (e.g., Bowditch, Coast Pilot, Chart 1). \u00b7 NOAA Hydrographic survey references (e.g., HSSD, FPM, IHO documents).\n2.4 Project Preparation\nOnce a field unit has received the Project CD/DVD, survey personnel should begin preparatory tasks such as reviewing project information, establishing a data management plan, contacting constituents, and planning horizontal and vertical control if necessary. These tasks are typically performed on a project-wide basis, prior to individual survey planning.\n2.4.1 Project Information and Instructions\nAs soon as practicable, the field unit should inventory files provided on the Project CD/DVD to verify that all necessary information has been included. Once it has been confirmed that all files are present, project information should be copied to the field unit's computer systems in accordance with the unit's standard data management practices. The OPS Project Manager or the NRB Technical Assistant will deliver draft Project Instructions approximately two months prior to the start of a project. The Field Operations Officer and Chief Hydrographic Surveyor should review the draft Project Instructions to raise questions and concerns with HSD OPS or NRB at this time. Once the final Project Instructions are delivered (approximately one month prior to the start of a project) all appropriate hydrographers should review the Project Instructions and Project CD/DVD files to become familiar with the project.\n2.4.2 Data Management\nGuidelines for effective field unit data management are described in the following sections.\n2.4.2.1 Digital Data Directory Structure\nData directory structures used during acquisition and processing may vary among field units. However, a standard should be in place within each field unit. It is important to adhere to any field unit directory standards, as some software configurations must reference specific directories. Refer to Appendix II for an example of a field unit directory structure.\n50\n\n\f2.4.2.2 Digital File Naming Conventions\nIt is important to follow file naming standards within the field unit. Maintaining these conventions greatly assists AHB and PHB in identifying data records. Do not create data files with non-standard names that are unrelated to the file content and will confuse others who must access that data. Additionally, any preliminary, temporary, or extraneous files created by the field unit should not be included with data submitted to AHB or PHB.\n2.4.3 Horizontal Control\nHorizontal Control (HorCon) refers to the terrestrial network of geodetic marks that support two-dimensional hydrographic positioning. Typically, NOAA field parties use USCG differential beacons to correct GPS for hydrographic positioning. USCG differential correctors are subjected to an internal quality control process, ensuring a stable meter-level service. Additionally, USCG differential beacons are precisely positioned; thus, it is generally unnecessary for NOAA field units to establish horizontal control points when using this positioning method.\nIn remote survey locations or confined areas such as a fjord, USCG differential correctors may be unavailable or severely limited. For these areas, the field unit shall establish at least one horizontal control point where a portable DGPS control station can be installed. A review of the survey area should be combined with local knowledge to determine a feasible location. Keep in mind that public properties are usually preferred over private properties because special permissions will typically not be necessary for future access. However, equipment security must also be considered in populated areas which are easily accessible. Security measures may include locking instruments, affixing owner identification to equipment, and choosing a discrete station location. After a suitable location has been chosen, the field unit should obtain permission to access the property and install HorCon equipment. If it is necessary to drill into rock during the installation, permits should be obtained for this purpose.\nThe Federal Aviation Administration's Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) may be used provided a QC procedure is followed as per Section 3.2.2 of the HSSDM.\nHorCon techniques may also be used to determine high accuracy DGPS positions for ATONs. If OCS's Update Service Branch requires that an ATON be positioned using high accuracy HorCon methods, specifications will be noted in the ATON information provided on the Project CD/DVD. Typically, higher order ATON positions will be required for range lights.\n2.4.4 Vertical Control\nVertical control refers to a network of geodetic marks that supports three-dimensional hydrographic positioning. Vertical control activities are typically conducted to support water level gauge installations, water level measurements, and ERS. Personnel from CO-OPS are responsible for all planning of tide and water level requirements for OCS hydrographic surveys. CO-OPS will analyze historical data and tidal characteristics for each project area, specify operational NOS control stations, specify general locations for subordinate water level stations to be installed, and provide the tidal zoning (both preliminary and final) to be used during survey operations.\nInstallation, operation, and maintenance of controlling water level stations is typically the responsibility of the CO-OPS Field Operations Division (FOD). However, the hydrographic field unit may be required to install, monitor, repair, and/or uninstall a control water level station under the instructions of the CO-OPS FOD. The Project Instructions will state if installation, operation, and/or removal of subordinate water level stations is\n51\n\n\frequired for a project. In such cases, FOD will work in collaboration with the field unit to complete these tasks. The field unit will be responsible for ellipsoidal positioning of benchmarks near subordinate water level stations, in accordance with section 4.2.5 of the HSSD.\nTo prepare for vertical control operations, the field unit should verify that all necessary equipment and tools have been obtained from CO-OPS. The following manuals should occupy the equiptment received from CO-OPS FOD:\n\u00b7 Portable Tide Gauge Setup, Configuration, and Data Export Procedure\n\u00b7 9210B Xlite Data Logger Operations and Maintenance Manual\n\u00b7 Paros User's Manual\n\u00b7 Satlink2 Operations and Maintenance Manual\n\u00b7 H-355 Pump User's Manual\nAsample equipment checklist for water level station installations is included inAppendix 2 (Wtr_Lvl_Statn_Equip_ Checklist.pdf). Several reference guides are available to assist the field unit with water level station procedures. For reference, the following manuals can be found on the Hydrosoft website and can also be downloaded from the CO-OPS website tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/pub.html\n\u00b7 NOS User's Guide for the Installation of Bench Marks and Leveling Requirements for Water Level Stations.\n\u00b7 Specifications and Deliverables for Installation, Operation, and Removal of Water Level Station\n\u00b7 CO-OPS User's Guide for Electronic Levels\n\u00b7 CO-OPS User's Guide for Writing Bench Mark Descriptions\n\u00b7 CO-OPS User's Guide for GPS Observations\nAdditionally, the field unit should review any subordinate water level station locations specified in the Project Instructions and, if necessary based on local knowledge, recommend alternate sites to CO-OPS. Keep in mind that public properties are usually preferred over private properties because special permissions will typically not be necessary for future access. However, equipment security must also be considered in populated areas which are easily accessible. Security measures may include locking instruments, affixing owner identification to equipment, and choosing a discrete station location. Once locations have been agreed upon, survey personnel should obtain permission to access the property and install the staff, benchmarks, and gauge at the selected site.\n2.4.5 Constituent Contact\nThe Project Instructions will list constituents who must be contacted at or near the beginning and end of field operations to discuss survey objectives and accomplishments. It is mandatory that the field unit contact the appropriate regional NOAA Navigation Manager as identified in the Project Instructions.\nThe Project Instructions will also list various local contacts for reference. These resources should not be overlooked and can often provide local knowledge regarding AWOIS items, shoaling, marine activities, traffic patterns,\n52\n\n\fand other areas of concern. Local information sources include Port Authorities, Pilot Associations, local ferry companies, fishermen, towing companies, U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and local and state government agencies. Information regarding local survey requests or charting concerns that will not be addressed during the current project should be conveyed to either the Chief of Operations or the Chief of NRB.\n\n2.4.5.1 Local Notice to Mariners Announcement\nPrior to commencing survey operations for a project, the field unit shall submit an announcement to be included in the USCG Local Notice to Mariners (LNM). At a minimum, this announcement should be submitted 2-weeks prior to commencing operations and include information about the project work area, the type of work being conducted, the field unit characteristics (e.g. size, color, markings of ship and launches), means of contacting the field unit, and the start and end dates of the survey. These announcements can be submitted via e-mail to the appropriate USCG District e-mail, which are listed in the LNM for each district (http://www.navcen.uscg. gov/?pageName=lnmMain). See Appendix 2 for an example of a LNM announcement.\n\n2.4.5.2 Cultural or Historic Submerged Features\n\nHSD Operations Branch will contact the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO), historical/archaeological contact at NOAA's Office of National Marine Sanctuaries (ONMS), or other relevant governmental agency during preparation of Project Instructions to request information on any historically significant man-made features on the seabed within the survey area. Information provided by these Historic Preservation Points of Contact (HPPOCs) will be included in the Project Instructions. While the Project Instructions will also include contact information, field units are generally not required to consult with the HPPOCs. Instead, the Hydrographic Processing Branches are responsible for contacting the HPPOCs in the event of discovery of a potentially historically significant manmade feature, in accordance with section 4.4.3 .\n\n2.4.5.3 Potential for Lost or Damaged Fishing Gear\n\nIn many areas, particularly the Northeast United States, field units may encounter significant densities of fixed or floating fishing gear; such as lobster pots, crab pots, fishing pots, long lines, gill nets, etc. NOAA field units should always attempt to minimize the impact of hydrographic survey operations on the commercial fishing industry. There is an expectation that Coast Survey and all field units will make every effort to prevent damage or interaction with fishing gear. However, if damage does occur, State agencies may not detain or prosecute a Federal employee for violation of State law. For example, it is a violation of Massachusetts law if someone destroys any lobster or other fishing gear and can be punished through a fine or imprisonment; however, if they are engaging in an activity authorized by the Federal law (e.g. conducting survey operations), then they cannot be detained. See Appendix 2 for a legal opinion from NOAA's Office of General Counsel.\n\nWhen operating in areas with high densities of fishing gear, field units should consider modifying survey operations to reduce the possibility of damaging fishing gear and survey equipment. Some steps that may be taken in areas of dense fishing gear include:\n\n\u00b7\n\nLimiting survey operation to daylight hours.\n\n\u00b7\n\nUtilizing survey launches instead of the ship to conduct operations.\n\n\u00b7\n\nUtilizing hull-mounted sonar systems instead of towed survey gear.\n\n\u00b7\n\nLimiting use of towed sensors such as Moving Vessel Profilers\n\n53\n\n\fIn an effort to be pro-active and incorporate better coordination, the Operations Branch will contact fishing and lobster associations and organizations to inform them, prior to the field season, where a NOAA survey vessel will be working and the approximate time frame. This notification will be completed via an official letter to the association president or other point of contact. The Navigation Manager for the region and field unit should be carbon copied on this letter. See Appendix 2 for an example of a notification letter.\nA mandatory point of contact will be listed in the Project Instructions for projects which have the potential to significantly interfere with the work of local fishermen/lobstermen. In those cases, the field unit must use that point of contact to solicit input and coordinate with the local fishermen/lobstermen in an effort to reduce possibility of fishing gear interaction and better plan survey operations.\nAdditionally, the Navigation Manager or field unit will submit an announcement of the survey project for inclusion in the USCG (LNM) as early as is practicable (usually as soon as Project Instructions are received). See section 2.4.5.1 for information on submitting announcements. These announcements should also be provided directly to the fishing or lobstermen association for distribution to their members and inclusion in their newsletters. Notices should not only be sent to associations operating in the region the survey operations are being conducted, but also adjacent associations, as they will likely have some overlap.\nWhile field units will make every effort not to cause damage or otherwise interfere with fishing gear, some entanglements and other damage may occur. In instances where fishing gear has been damaged local fisherman or lobstermen may make a claim regarding lost or damaged fishing gear and request compensation. The claims process for damaged fishing gear that may have been damaged by a NOAA hydrographic survey field unit is listed below:\n1. Initial claims of gear interaction may be received from the fishermen by the field unit, the USCG, or the State Marine Patrol. Claimants will typically be referred to the State Marine Patrol as the best point of entry into the process. Note that NOAA hydrographic survey field units are not authorized to collect sworn statements, so whenever possible claimants should be referred to a law enforcement agency.\n2. State Marine Patrol and NMFS Office of Law Enforcement special agents will collaborate to collect sworn statements from affected fishermen, depending on whether alleged loss occured in state or federal waters. At a minimum, claims need to give the location of gear lost, estimate of when it was lost, what was lost, and the fair market value.\n3. All completed claims will be routed from NMFS OLE special agents to the regional NOAA Navigation Manager.\n4. The Navigation Manager will request route data from the field unit, and compare the positions and times of the alleged loss with the unit's activities. The Navigation Manager may request assistance from the local NOAA Fisheries lab to determine if fair market value claimed for lost gear is reasonable.\n5. The Navigation Manager will forward substantiated claims to NOAA Office of General Counsel for final certification and payment. See Appendix 2 for an example letter for reimbursement. Unsubstantiated claims will be referred back to the State Marine Patrol and NMFS OLE with supporting documentation.\n6. OCS and OMAO leadership will determine how costs of any claims will be shared.\n54\n\n\f2.5 Survey Planning\nOCS recommends that systematic data acquisition plans be prepared prior to vessel operations.These plans may consist of lines used directly for vessel navigation, polygons used to designate survey areas if the acquisition software provides a real time coverage map, or target files used to mark pre-determined data acquisition points.\nWhen creating data acquisition plans, many factors must be considered, including the scope of the survey, object detection criteria, sheet layout with respect to surrounding features, available data acquisition systems, number of features to be addressed, traffic patterns, local currents, tide stages, and prevailing weather and sea conditions. Input from other survey personnel, particularly those who have previously operated in the area, can be invaluable when creating data acquisition plans. Proposed plans should be reviewed by the FOO and/or Chief-of-Party prior to vessel operations.\n2.5.1 Survey Scope\nThe scope of an OCS hydrographic survey will be categorized as basic hydrographic, navigable area, field examination, or special project. Survey requirements will vary according to this classification. The type of survey to be conducted and any special requirements will be identified in the Project Instructions.\nThe type of specific hydrographic survey projects are created via an evaluation of known requirements and priorities. Survey limits are based on these requirements and priorities as well as quantitative and qualitative measures of shipping and boating in an area, the adequacy of existing survey information in the area, the rate of change of the bathymetry, safety precautions and an assessment/weighting of benefit versus efficiency.\n2.5.1.1 Basic Hydrographic Surveys\nA basic hydrographic survey must be able to stand alone, without supplementation by any other survey. The basic survey must be adequate to supersede all prior surveys for charting purposes and meet all applicable survey requirements specified in HSSD.\n2.5.1.2 Navigable Area Surveys\nNavigable area surveys must meet the requirements of basic hydrographic surveys, but will have special survey limits defined in the Project Instructions. Typically for this type of survey, the limits have been restricted to omit areas that are not considered navigationally significant. Another scenario would be restricting the survey to primary shipping traffic areas. Assigned survey limits may require adjustment based on safety and field unit observations of local traffic patterns. Any significant survey limit adjustments shall be coordinated through the Chief of OPS.\n2.5.1.3 Field Examinations\nField Examinations (FE) are item investigations or surveys that cover small areas of specific interest. These surveys may be assigned to prove/disprove the existence of reported dangers or obstructions, to provide data for harbor development, or to supplement prior surveys for construction of large-scale charts.\n55\n\n\f2.5.1.4 Special Projects\nSpecial Projects are surveys typically performed for purposes other than creating nautical charts, such as habitat mapping, ocean exploration, or homeland security. The Project Instructions will define requirements for Special Projects.\nNote: Depending upon the type of project, data acquired for Special Projects may be subject to additional security measures. Any required security practices will be defined in the Project Instructions. The field unit should use discretion when handling Special Project data and contact the Chief of OPS or Chief of NRB if data security requirements are in question.\n2.5.1.5 Homeland Security Surveys\nHomeland security surveys may be assigned in response to requests by the US Naval Oceanographic Office (NAVOCEANO) for hydrography to support Homeland Security in the nation's coastal waterways. These projects are typically 200% side scan sonar surveys conducted in accordance with NOS requirements for SSS data acquisition and processing with minor modifications. Any additional project specific requirements will be provided in the Project Instructions. In the event that it is not possible to adhere to the HLS specifications, Chief, HSD Operations Branch should be contacted for further guidance.\nSpecial attention should be given to setting up survey plans and file structures when a survey area contains a region to be submitted for Homeland Security purposes. Careful advance planning will ensure that the relevant Homeland Security survey data and associated ancillary files will be easily extractable for submission to NAVOCEANO.\n2.5.2 Object Detection Criteria\nUnless otherwise specified by the Project Instructions, all data acquisition shall be conducted to meet object detection criteria as set forth in the HSSD; this may be accomplished with SSS, MBES, or a combination of the two. Object detection capabilities are dependent upon the acoustical characteristics of the sonar system. Vessel speed versus sonar pulse repetition rate (ping rate) must also be considered in order to meet coverage requirements in the along track direction. Standards set by OCS for object detection vary depending on sonar technology and requirements for each sonar type are discussed individually below.\n2.5.2.1 Side Scan Sonar (SSS)\nThe HSSD states that side scan sonar systems shall be operated such that a 1m x 1m x 1m object on the sea floor can be detected from acoustic shadow measurements. OCS has determined that this object detection criteria can be met by acquiring a minimum of 3 independent ensonifications (pings) per meter traveled in the along-track direction. This criterion can be met by regulating vessel speed based on sonar range scale. Longer operating ranges have slower pulse repetition rates, thus requiring that the vessel speed be slower to meet object detection requirements. Refer to sections sections 6.1.2 and 6.1.3 of the HSSD for further guidance on side scan object detection standards. Sonar ping rates should be defined in the operator's manual or the manufacturer's technical documentation.\n56\n\n\f2.5.2.2 Multibeam Echosounder (MBES)\nMultibeam echosounder object detection criteria vary according to water depth. Adequate detection has been defined by OCS as 3.2 beam footprints, center-to-center, per 3 meters (in depths of 40 meters or less) or a distance equal to 10 percent of the depth (in depths greater than 40 meters). In the along track direction, this criterion can be met by regulating vessel speed based on sonar range scale, which directly affects ping rate. Since the size of MBES beam footprints will be greater as the angle from nadir increases, object detection capabilities should be calculated based on outer beams. Field personnel should refer to section 5.2.2 of the HSSD for further guidance on multibeam object detection standards. Sonar ping rates should be defined in the operator's manual or the manufacturer's technical documentation.\n2.5.3 Survey Line Planning\nBefore creating a line plan, the Project Instructions should be reviewed for any required methodology, line spacing, or coverage requirements. Besides Project Instruction requirements, factors such as general bathymetry, traffic patterns, shoreline features, currents, prevailing weather and sea states, and distance from GPS base stations should also be considered during line plan creation. New features discovered during operations may warrant additional adjustments to line plans as the survey progresses. It should be noted that survey limits are subject to revision based upon command decision and/or requirements for safe vessel operation. Any significant survey limit adjustments shall be coordinated through the Chief of HSD Operations Branch.\nSafety should never be compromised for the sole purpose of following a line plan. Line plans used for data acquisition can be classified into the following categories:\n\u00b7 Mainscheme (MBES, SSS, or VBES)\n\u00b7 Holidays (MBES, SSS or VBES)\n\u00b7 Crosslines (MBES or VBES)\n\u00b7 Developments (MBES or VBES)\n\u00b7 Target Files\n\u00b7 Special Circumstances\nAcquisition requirements vary depending upon data category and the type of equipment used. OCS recommends that field units standardize survey line numbering such that data classification can be determined based upon line number. For example, use the 100 number series for the first 100% of side scan sonar lines; the 200 number series for 200% side scan numbers; the 300 number series for side scan holidays lines; the 400 - 500 number series for mainscheme multibeam lines; the 600 - 800 number series for development data; and the 900 number series for crosslines. Specific line numbering standards have not been implemented by OCS; however, standardization within each field unit is strongly recommended.\nLine plan requirements and guidelines for each data category are discussed in the following sections. Keep in mind that these guidelines are provided to help the field unit maximize survey efficiency, but they should not be followed at the expense of personnel and vessel safety.\n57\n\n\f2.5.3.1 Mainscheme\nMainscheme refers to the primary survey data that are systematically acquired to meet basic survey requirements. Mainscheme data are typically comprised of complete or object detection MBES data or 200% SSS imagery data acquired simultaneously with VBES bathymetry. However, in some circumstances variances such as a combination of complete multibeam and 100% side scan data may be preferred.\nWhen planning mainscheme lines, special consideration should be given to junction areas. For surveys that are part of the same current project and from the same year, data overlap in junction areas shall be sufficient to ensure continuous coverage. To adjoin with a non-contemporary survey from a different year and possibly conducted by a different vessel, a 100-200 meter overlap of mainscheme data is required, unless the Project Instructions and provided project limits indicate otherwise.\n2.5.3.1.1 Multibeam Echosounder (MBES)\nWhen planning mainscheme MBES lines, the hydrographer must consider object detection requirements, echosounder system, and water depth. If complete coverage is desired, line spacing will vary according to the effective swath width. The available swath width will vary between systems, but object detection requirements may require data filtering by swath angle or could even limit the types of sonars which may be used. Generally, lines should be oriented parallel to depth contours for consistent swath widths and line spacing. The following formula can be used as a general rule of thumb for determining swath width:\nAvailable Swath Width = 2 x Water Depth x (tangent 1/2 swath angle) The hydrographer should keep in mind that allowing for adequate data overlap when planning mainscheme lines can significantly reduce the number of holidays created during acquisition. Based on the above formula and collective OCS experience, mainscheme line spacing is commonly set at 3 x Water Depth to obtain complete coverage.\nIn special cases, partial MBES coverage may be used for mainscheme survey data. This type of coverage might be assigned if time is limited and existing survey data are fairly modern. In such cases, required line spacing will be noted in the Project Instructions. For further information on MBES requirements for OCS surveys, see section 5.2.2 of the HSSD.\n2.5.3.1.2 Side Scan Sonar (SSS)\nTypically, two-hundred percent coverage is required when using SSS as a mainscheme survey technique. One hundred percent coverage is completed by acquiring data that meet the assigned object detection requirements over the entire survey area one time. This process is performed a second time to obtain two-hundred percent coverage. Side scan sonar data quality will, inherently, degrade both at nadir and at outer ranges. Because of this characteristic, line plans for the second hundred percent should be either offset or oriented differently than the first hundred percent. OCS recommends offsetting 200% lines by \u00bd of the line spacing for the first 100% coverage. If possible, SSS data should be acquired by running lines perpendicular to depth contours to avoid imagery distortion caused by slopes in the athwartships direction.\nNote: Multibeam backscatter imagery is not considered equivalent to, or a replacement for, side scan sonar imagery. Side scan sonar provides low grazing-angle imagery that enables identification of features not visible in lower resolution, higher grazing angle MBES backscatter imagery.\n58\n\n\fThe line spacing necessary to obtain 100% SSS coverage is dependent upon the effective range scale, achievable positional accuracy, and any positioning errors inherent to a towed system. A good rule of thumb to obtain complete coverage is to plan survey line spacing at 1.6 x Range Scale, allowing for an overlap of 40% of range scale (20% of the total swath) between adjacent swaths. Note: Range Scale refers to the athwartships distance ensonified on each side of the towfish. Thus, Range Scale equals one half of the total swath ensonified.\nGenerally, SSS range scale is chosen for maximum survey efficiency. The sonar should be maintained at an altitude of 8 - 20% of range scale during acquisition; thus, water depth will determine an upper range scale limit or a particular survey area. However, the hydrographer should also consider the system configuration and if a minimum sonar depth will be necessary to avoid water column disturbances such as propeller wash. Based on the chosen range scale's corresponding ping rate, vessel speed should be adjusted to ensure that object detection criteria are met (see section 2.5.2.1 ). If a specific range scale is required for a survey, it will be indicated in the Project Instructions.\n2.5.3.1.3 Vertical Beam Echosounder (VBES)\nSince complete coverage can not be efficiently completed using VBES alone, this will rarely be assigned as the sole method for acquiring mainscheme survey data. Typically, VBES systems will be used to provide correlating sounding data for SSS operations, define an inshore contour, or develop very shoal or foul areas where there is a high probability of damaging either a MBES or SSS system.\nIf VBES has been assigned as a stand-alone mainscheme data acquisition method, the required line spacing will be noted in the Project Instructions. If possible, VBES mainscheme data should be acquired by running lines perpendicular to depth contours. This practice assists the hydrographer in accurately identifying contour intervals. If extensive discrepancies are found between VBES sounding data and charted depths, the Chief of OPS or Chief of NRB should be contacted to determine if a more extensive survey is warranted.\n2.5.3.2 Holidays\nHolidays are defined as gaps in mainscheme data or areas where accuracy requirements have not been met. Holidays may be caused by various events, such as vessel maneuvering, survey equipment problems, unexpected shoals, or rejection of poor quality data during post-processing. Holiday line plans are typically developed to address these data gaps as mainscheme acquisition progresses, rather than at the end of mainscheme operations. This practice will minimize transit time required to revisit each area of the survey with a holiday and the time required to acquire, process, and manage additional sound speed profiles. If the field unit uses a real-time coverage map during mainscheme data acquisition, most holidays can be identified and addressed prior to ceasing operations that day, thus increasing survey efficiency.\n2.5.3.3 Crosslines\nCrossline data are used to identify any systematic data problems by comparing it to mainscheme data acquired at different times, water levels, and line azimuths. Separate vessels may also be used for crossline data acquisition to help identify any vessel to vessel system biases.\nIdeally, crosslines should be acquired prior to mainscheme data, in areas of gently sloping bottom, and when water levels are as close to survey datum (MLLW) as practicable. Crossline data may not agree well with mainscheme soundings if acquired in areas of irregular submarine relief and/or if VBES systems are used. In rocky areas, large\n59\n\n\fdepth differences may occur over small horizontal distances, making a small positioning error appear to be a large depth error. This effect is often noted when using VBES systems due to the large beam footprint.\n2.5.3.4 Developments\nA development is performed to either obtain a least depth over a known point feature or further define an area based feature such as a shoal. Typically, dense MBES data are acquired for developments, although multiple VBES lines may be more appropriate for defining very shoal area features due to the significant decrease of MBES efficiency in such depths. If a VBES system is used to determine the least depth on a point feature, several parallel lines should be run over the feature until the hydrographer is confident that the least depth is recorded. A third method for determining a feature's least depth is by diver investigation. The process of using a diver least depth gauge is discussed in section 3.2.5 For additional information on feature investigation, refer to section 4.4. Note: Conducting developments during high stages of tide will improve MBES efficiency and may also provide increased vessel safety by maximizing underkeel clearance. If development lines are created to be run during a specific tide range, the hydrographer must be certain to convey this information to the vessel crew that will be acquiring the data.\nWhen developing point features, least depths should be acquired using the center region of the MBES swath, typically 45\u00b0 or less off nadir. This section of the MBES swath will have less error due to refraction than the outer beams. It is recommended that, during development acquisition, a confidence swath be run in an orthogonal direction to the primary development lines. A common MBES development line plan may appear to be an assortment of \"H\" or \"+\" patterns over numerous features.\n2.5.4 Survey Polygon Planning\nMost field units will be equipped with data acquisition software that allows the sonar operator and the coxswain to view a real-time coverage DTM of the data being acquired. As an alternative to line planning, which is most often redundant with this software capability, polygons that define areas to be covered are created by the sheet manager. While the entire area could just be covered with a continuous line, polygons provide the hydrographer with discreet sections to be covered assisting in better plans for survey timing and vessel efficiency. Most of the guidance that applies to line plans also applies to polygon planning. The data should still be acquired with the boat traveling parallel to the contours.\n\u00b7 Polygons should be planned such that the boat will be running offshore to nearshore. This is a safety tip! Creating separate offshore and onshore polygons (those that can be run at any time vs. those that need a specific tide window) is also helpful.\n\u00b7 Make polygons longer in the dimension the boat should run, providing a clear indication to the coxswain and surveyor of the polygon's directionality. (If running N to S will be most efficient with the contours, make your polygon longer in the N to S dimension).\n\u00b7 If there is a MHW Buffer, a limit line that defines the shoal edge of the survey (survey to the 4 meter curve) or a NALL established during shoreline verification, do not plan polygons inshore of these limits unless there is a specific reason to do so.\n\u00b7 In a channel that could be filled in with one polygon (shore to shore), consider breaking it down into two polygons such that there is a straight edge in the middle of the channel. This provides the vessel with a straight baseline, and encourages running from offshore to nearshore.\n60\n\n\f\u00b7 Set polygons up in such a way that turns are minimized and lines are of a manageable length for processing.\n\u00b7 Be aware of any possible sources of fresh water, or other factors that will affect the water column and make smaller polygons in these areas.\n2.5.4.1 AWOIS Items\nFor all assigned AWOIS investigations, the entire search radius shall be investigated if possible, regardless of its position relative to the survey limits. Specific investigation methods considered adequate for an item's disproval will be noted in the attributes of the placeholder AWOIS feature, CRANES. Often, AWOIS items can be investigated in conjunction with mainscheme data acquisition.\nNote: If the entire search radius is not investigated, it is nearly impossible to disprove an AWOIS item.\n2.5.4.2 Target Files\nTarget files refer to a collection of geographic positions designated for point data acquisition. These files are typically created to designate specific positions for acquiring other types of data. For example, the hydrographer may create a target file to show the specific position where a sound velocity profile is desired or specific locations of items to be developed.\n2.5.4.2.1 Bottom Samples\nSamples of bottom sediment throughout the survey area shall be obtained and analyzed in accordance with the HSSD, if required by the Project Instructions. A bottom sample plan is compiled by the HSD Project Manager and delivered to the field unit in the Project Reference File (PRF) using the S- 57 Object Class, `SPRING'. The field unit should review the bottom sample plan to the survey data acquired (bathymetry and backscatter) to determine if the bottom sample locations are appropriate. The survey data will often better differentiate varying bottom characteristics within the survey compared to the bottom sample plan. The field unit should contact HSD Operations Branch to discuss modifying the plan if needed.\n2.5.4.3 Special Circumstances\n2.5.4.3.1 Search Patterns\nIn emergency or accident situations, NOAA field units may be involved with wreck, obstruction, or debris searches. When planning this type of operation, the direction of the search pattern should be oriented within 20\u00b0 of the set of any significant current present in the survey area. This arrangement will minimize towfish offset from the planned tracks, increase position accuracy, and increase towfish stability by minimizing forces that are not aligned with the longitudinal axis of the towfish. However, tracks run in the same direction as a very strong current may result in an increased speed over ground, which could decrease object detection capabilities; thus, this parameter should be monitored if searching for small objects. If strong currents exist in the area and running search tracks in a pattern oriented normal to the current is unavoidable, the operations should be timed to coincide with periods of slack or minimum current, if possible.\n61\n\n\f2.5.4.3.2 Special Wreck Investigations If a hydrographic field unit discovers a potentially significant historic wreck site, or conducts a special wreck investigation through a contract from another NOAA program or a request from a NOAA Navigation Manager, the field unit should make an effort to ensonify the wreck site and associated debris field with each type of sonar system that is readily available. When conducting side scan sonar operations, run parallel tracks on either side of the wreck, so that both sides are imaged, as well as two additional tracks orthogonal to the site. The imagery and bathymetry data will provide clues to the wreck's status and identity, identify any obstructions, and provide researchers with an adequate baseline assessment with which to compare future surveys.\n2.5.5 Survey Plan Finalization Proposed survey acquisition plans should be reviewed by the FOO and/or Chief-of-Party and any necessary adjustments made. Once approved by the Chief-of-Party, the plan should be converted from the format generated by the GIS software used to design the plan to a format that can be read by the field unit's survey navigation software. Typically, acquisition plans will be designed using CARIS Notebook or Bathy DataBASE software for polygon planning or MapInfo software for line planning. The MapInfo files are converted into a HYPACK line file (*.lnw) or HYPACK target file (*.tgt) for vessel navigation. This specific conversion process can be accomplished using the Hydro_MI.mbx MapBasic tool, which will also report the number and the total mileage of the planned lines. Number and mileage statistics should be recorded and used to estimate the amount of time required to complete the survey. These estimations are critical to overall project planning.\n2.5.6 Preparing the Survey Crew The Survey Manager will provide a boat sheet to the survey crew(s) with a plot depicting line plans, polygons, and/or shoreline files overlaid on the largest scale chart with any uncharted hazards, lines planned for acquisition during high tide or slack current, AWOIS items, contacts, and/or developments prior to each survey day.\n62\n\n\fChapter 3\nData Acquisition\n3.1 Sensor Risk Management\nNOAA field units deploy valuable oceanographic sensors in the water when conducting hydrographic surveys. The sensors are typically deployed in a variety of ways including: mounted directly on the hull of the survey vessel, suspended in the water by mounting them to a rigid retractable pole, towed via a cable, and temporarily installed on shore.\n3.1.1 Best practices for preventing loss of equipment\nThe utmost care should be taken to prevent the loss of a hydrographic sensor prior to its deployment. This is accomplished through regular inspection of all key components of survey systems, proper preventative maintenance, safe operation procedures, and adequate precautionary measures to aid in recovery if a loss does occur.\nAll mounting hardware should be inspected regularly (weekly inspections are recommended) for defects or potential loosening. It is useful to mark mounting hardware, such as screws and bolts, with a reference mark to indicate whether the fasteners are backing out and becoming loose. Components that are susceptible to degradation in marine environments such as rubber isolation mounts or metal fasteners prone to oxidation should be checked regularly for material condition. Routine inspection of mounting hardware and components for any sensor system should have an established inspection schedule that is determine by the likelihood of system loss. A period of no more than 1 week between inspections is recommended.\nIf available, safety devices designed to prevent the loss of a sensor (i.e. a safety cable attachment) or aid in the recovery of a sensor (i.e. a pinging locator beacon) should be used at all times. These devices and associated components should be checked regularly (weekly inspections are recommended) for material defect, damage, or disengagement of fastening components. In the case of a system that is deployed over the side and is not statically mounted, the safety system should be checked before every deployment of the sensor. Fixed mounted sensor's safety systems should be checked on a regular basis in the same manner as the mounting hardware.\nIf possible, the sensors should be stowed for transit (i.e. SSS tow-fish secured on deck, swing arm multibeam in the retracted position, etc.) when not in use.\nWhenever the launch is operating with sensors in the water (which may be at all times in the case of a fixed mount sensor array) the sensors should be operating and the vessel's navigation system should be recording data. If the sensor is not operational and not being actively monitored, the loss could occur without being noticed. Additionally, an accurate position for the vessel at the time of loss is extremely important in locating the sensor if a loss should occur.\n63\n\n\fDual frequency GPS base stations may be installed for up to 30 days in a variety of locations. Once installed it is important to ensure that the antennae are not disturbed or moved for the duration of deployment. Antennae should be secured in such a way that wind and rain or snow events will not move the antennae. GPS receivers as well as batteries and radio electronics should be enclosed in a weather proof, locking case. Care should be taken to stage this equipment in secured areas (whenever possible) to prevent vandalism or theft. If the base station is installed in a remote location, the user should be aware of natural conditions (such as wildlife) that may disturb the installation and take action to prevent damage or loss.\n3.1.2 Best practices for recovery of lost equipment\nWhile the guidance outlined in section above are intended to prevent sensor loss, a loss may still occur. In the event of a sensor loss, the probability of recovery can be maximized by (1) rapidly informing the ship of the potential loss, (2) determining if the sensor might still be connected to the launch, (3) determining an accurate and precise location where the loss occurred, and (4) utilizing all available search and recovery means to locate the sensor as soon as possible. Details for each item are below.\nOnce a loss is suspected, the entire survey crew should be informed so that appropriate action can be taken. The ship should be notified immediately as they can provide additional guidance on the proper course of action and dispatch assistance. The loss of a sensor with mountings that go through the hull could represent a catastrophic failure in hull integrity. It is important that other vessels be made aware of the situation so that response can begin immediately.\nThe vessel should immediately come to a gentle stop as the sensor may still be attached by a safety tether or electrical cabling. The vessel should avoid transiting at speed until it is confirmed that the sensor is not still attached. If possible, divers should enter the water and examine the sensor mounting to determine if the sensor is still attached by any means. If the sensor is held in place by cabling or a safety tether, it should obviously be retrieved. However, if retrieval is not feasible (i.e. dangerous conditions, insufficient equipment, etc.) or is determined to be too risky (i.e. launch is in water too deep for dive recovery if the sensor should become disconnected) then the dive team should secure it as best as possible and the launch should make its way at slow speed to a more appropriate recovery location (i.e. the ship or shallow water). If it is not possible to use divers to investigate, the launch should transit at slow speed back to the ship or other area of safety, where an inspection of the sensor mounting can be performed.\nAs soon as a loss is suspected, the position of the survey launch should by marked in the acquisition system if possible or noted via GPS coordinates or, at the very least, roughly plotted on a chart. A successful recovery of the sensor is dependent on having an accurate location to begin the search. Marking this location, even if approximate, at the time of the loss will greatly increase the chances of locating the sensor subsequent to its loss.\nAlternately, if the navigation data was logged, the position for loss can likely be determined through analysis of the data. For instance, logging POS data throughout the day will allow post processing in the POSPac software suite to generate a smooth best estimate of trajectory (SBET) for the launch, which will provide an extremely accurate track-line. If the sensor package was recording at the time of loss, the exact time of disconnection should be easily determined and coupling this time with the accurate track-line data for the launch will result in an exact position for sensor loss. If the sensor was not recording when lost, it is still possible to determine the approximate time of loss by examining the HYPACK log file, which will generate an error message when the data string from the sensor is lost. There is approximately an 8 second time lag between disconnection of a sensor from HYPACK and the data timeout error being entered in the log (note that this timing latency may vary with different sensors). If you are unsure of the timing latency and a similar instrument set-up is available, it may be useful to experiment with error log time to determine the latency.\n64\n\n\fOnce a position for the loss is determined, the search and recovery operation for the sensor should begin. It is imperative to begin the search operation as soon as possible after the loss to increase the probability of locating the sensor. All available means should be used to conduct the search. If located, the likelihood of recovery is good. Search mechanism should be determined based on depth of search area and bottom type. Multibeam is of limited use in locating objects smaller than a meter, unless in relatively shallow water. A side scan tow fish may provide the best chance of detecting the sensor. If other survey vessels are operating in the area it could be possible to immediately survey the area with multibeam or side scan sonar for any indication of the lost sensor. A diver search and recovery is the best way to locate and recover the sensor. In water where diving is not possible or practical, an ROV can be very useful for locating small objects, such as a sensor.\n3.2 Bathymetry Acquisition\nNOAA hydrographic field units primarily use two types of echosounders to acquire bathymetry data:, multibeam echosounders (MBES) and vertical beam echosounders (VBES). This section is dedicated to operating echosounder systems and recording sonar data using common software packages.\n3.2.1 Lead Line Data\nA lead line can be used to measure depths in areas too shallow for echosounders, to verify least depths over dangers to navigation or shoals, and to calibrate echosounders. Lead line soundings should be acquired at slack current, if possible, to ensure that readings are true vertical measurements of depth. All lead line soundings should be clearly identified as such in the survey records. The hydrographer shall also, at a minimum, record the lead line number, geographic position, and time of measurement for each sounding. Water level correctors must be applied to lead line data during post-processing.\n3.2.2 Sounding Pole Data\nSounding poles can be used to acquire data in near shore areas where depths are less than 4 meters. Sounding poles should be carefully deployed so that a significant amount of sediment penetration does not occur and a true vertical measurement of depth is obtained. Each pole sounding should be clearly identified as such in the survey records. The hydrographer shall also, at a minimum, record the sounding pole number or identifier, geographic position, and time of measurement for each sounding. Water level corrections must be applied to sounding pole data during post-processing.\n3.2.3 Vertical Beam Echosounder (VBES) Data\nVertical beam echosounder systems may vary among NOAA hydrographic field units. Most OCS systems are dual frequency, using both a high and a low frequency, with beamwidths between three and eight degrees for high frequency, larger for low frequency (20-30 degrees). Provided the magnitude of vessel roll and pitch is less than the sonar beamwidth, these attitude characteristics will have little effect on sounding accuracy and their application to VBES data is not required by OCS. However, to maintain data quality in sea states where vessel roll and pitch angles exceed sonar beam width, OCS recommends that an external sensor be used to record heave data for application during post-processing. If a heave sensor is not employed, the VBES system should be used only when conditions are favorable for minimizing heave bias and data must be scanned for heave artifacts during postprocessing. Data acquisition should be suspended if the heave signature exceeds 0.5 meters and a heave sensor is not being used.\n65\n\n\fMany VBES systems output calculated depth values rather than the two-way travel time of each sonar ping. To facilitate internal depth calculations, these types of VBES systems must be configured with an estimated value for the speed of sound through the water column. When necessary, hydrographic field units shall configure VBES systems using 1500 m/s, the standard estimate for the speed of sound in sea water. VBES data shall then be corrected using a full sound speed profile during post-processing.\nNote: Sonar manufacturers often suggest applying real-time attitude, sound speed, and other corrections during data acquisition. It is OCS's standard policy to apply such data corrections during post-processing if possible.\nThe HYPACK software package is commonly used by NOAA hydrographic field units to acquire VBES data. OCS guidelines for using HYPACK with VBES systems are described below. Users should also refer to the HYPACK systems incompatible with HYPACK should consult the appropriate user's manuals and/or contact the regional HSTP Field Support Liaison for guidance.\n3.2.3.1 HYPACK\nHYPACK is produced by HYPACK, Inc. This software is compatible with most types of VBES systems and can also be used for MBES data acquisition, as discussed in section 3.2.4.1 In addition to recording bathymetry data, HYPACK includes capabilities for completing the following tasks:\n\u00b7 Survey preparation and line planning.\n\u00b7 Precise survey line navigation.\n\u00b7 Recording of supporting sensor data such as position, heading, and attitude.\n\u00b7 GPS coordinated time-tagging of sonar and supporting data.\n\u00b7 Display of geo-referenced images as background files during acquisition.\n3.2.3.1.1 System Setup\nTo record, or \"log,\" data using HYPACK, a Project must first be created. Separate HYPACK Projects are typically created either for each survey or for each data type to be acquired. Be certain to save each newly created Project with a unique name, or all changes will be lost when another Project is loaded. Critical steps for Project creation are described below. Once saved, Projects can be loaded and changed as necessary.\n3.2.3.1.1.1 Device Setup\nFor each Project, the hydrographer should assign a default Device Setup that includes drivers and recording settings for each sensor. Since data formats can vary drastically and HYPACK manages data for numerous sensors, it is critical that the correct Device Setup be loaded for each type of sensor being used. If a Project's default Device Setup is incorrect for the systems being used, a different Device Setup can be loaded after the Project has been opened. Although creating a Project for each survey seems well organized, having a Project for each data type may better ensure that the correct Device Setup is used for data acquisition if multiple configurations will be needed for a single survey. OCS recommends that master Device Setups for each system configuration be backedup to a removable disk and maintained by the FOO or equivalent.\n66\n\n\fAs a general rule, no offsets should be entered in the HYPACK Device Setup. It is OCS's policy to record survey data in the most \"raw\" form possible, then apply corrections and offsets during post-processing. One exception to this rule is transducer offsets. Transducer offsets entered in HYPACK will not be applied to recorded data. However, they will affect the displayed data and may be desirable for precise line-steering, particularly if offsets are large as with a side-mounted system.\n3.2.3.1.1.2 Geodesy\nDefault geodesy parameters should be set for each Project. All OCS hydrographic survey data shall be acquired in the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83). This is accomplished in HYPACK by selecting the GRS80 ellipsoid and appropriate UTM zone.\n3.2.3.1.1.3 Line and Background Files\nPlanned survey line files and any associated background files, such as charts and limits, should be loaded for each Project. HYPACK is capable of reading these files from any local computer directory as well as across a network. However, it is recommended that all Project files be stored within the local HYPACK Project directory. This file management strategy is easily implemented by using the File > Add File and Copy option when initially loading Project files, which will automatically copy each file to the current HYPACK Project directory.\n3.2.3.1.2 Recording Data\nPrior to recording survey data in HYPACK, certain critical system settings and operations should be verified. These quick system checks are highly recommended by OCS, as they can prevent errors that require extensive editing or complete reacquisition of data.\n3.2.3.1.2.1 Time Synchronization\nThrough the Kinematic.dll device driver, HYPACK uses an internal timing algorithm called \"Veritime\" to time stamp data during acquisition. Veritime synchronizes the time recorded in the raw data to UTC time from the GPS system, and will also automatically reset the acquisition computer clock to UTC time. By default, Veritime will determine UTC time from the GPS receiver's NMEA0183 ZDA message. Thus, the hydrographer must ensure that this ZDA message is being output by the GPS unit. Note: HYPACK provides an option to \"Sync clock on other sentences than ZDA.\" This option is not recommended by OCS and should not be used for OCS survey data without first contacting the regional HSTP Field Support Liaison. Time is a critical component of survey data, and it is recommended that the hydrographer periodically verify that time stamps are being applied correctly to logged data.\n3.2.3.1.2.2 Devices Test\nOnce all survey sensors are operating, the user should test that sensor data are being properly received by HYPACK. By navigating through the HYPACK Hardware program, the user can \"Test All\" devices. This function opens a new window for each sensor in the current Device Setup. Data strings being received by HYPACK will be displayed for each device. Although data strings can be complex, the expected data from each sensor should be easily identifiable somewhere in the datagram. Two common problem indicators during this test are either no data\n67\n\n\for a string of gibberish being displayed. No data being displayed is often indicative of sensor or cable failure, while gibberish frequently means that the sensor output baud rate does not agree with the receiving baud rate setting in HYPACK.\n3.2.3.1.2.3 Logged Data Paths\nBy default, HYPACK will log survey line data under the active HYPACK Project directory in a folder named \"Raw\", and target files will be recorded to a file in the format mmddyyyy.tgt created in the Project directory. However, each field unit will have a standard directory structure to which data and targets should be logged. It is important for the user to check \"Override Project Path\" (in SURVEY mode under Options > Project Information) and select the appropriate folder for both survey line data and target file data prior to beginning daily data acquisition. Using this option, survey and target data may be logged anywhere on the local system or across a network.\nAdditional point data can be appended to a target file by pre-loading an existing target file. Pre-loading is accomplished in the primary HYPACK window by copying files into the \"Target Files\" folder, a process similar to loading planned survey line files. Target files can also be loaded as Chart Files (background data) in SURVEY mode, but these targets will be simply displayed on the screen, i.e., it will not be possible to select a target and see a range and bearing to it for use in navigation.\n3.2.3.1.2.4 File Extensions\nUnless otherwise specified, VBES data will be automatically recorded with the file extension *.raw. However, it is OCS standard policy to log HYPACK VBES data with a Day of Year (DOY) file extension. Note: HYPACK erroneously terms the DOY format as \"Julian Day\". In SURVEY mode, the \"Julian Day as Extension\" option should be chosen under the Options > Project Information menu to create files with DOY extensions.\n3.2.4 Multibeam Echosounder Data\nNOAA hydrographic field units typically use swath systems which produce multiple acoustic beams from a single transducer and measure both the angle and two-way travel time of the acoustic signals. The frequency of the signal varies from system to system and typically ranges between 12 and 455 kHz. During each sonar ping, a projector transmits a swath of acoustic energy into the water and reflected energy returns to the transducer where it is detected by a hydrophone.\nSwath MBES systems may be capable of two different scanning modes: (1) Equidistant and (2) Equiangular.\nThe equidistant mode electronically forms the center of each footprint at a uniform distance from each other across the swath width. This even sampling across the swath width reduces the amount of overlapping coverage and intensity of returns in the inner half of the swath in effort to improve resolution in the outer beams. This is not recommended for hazard investigation surveys because of weak, lower resolution inner beams. Another disadvantage of this mode is that it reduces the received signal aperture of the outer beams thus reducing the possibility of detecting distant returns.\n68\n\n\fThe equiangular mode electronically forms the receiving beams in equal angles. This means in the outer beams the beam footprint increases in length across-track providing bottom coverage across the entire swath width. The advantage of this mode is the overlapping coverage of the inner half of the swath, excellent for hazard investigation surveys where precise measurements of small targets are necessary. The primary disadvantage is the lower resolution in the outer beams. To maintain equal resolution across an entire survey area, survey lines must be planned for at 100% overlap (outer beam matching the nadir of the adjacent lines).\nNOAA hydrographic field units have mounted MBES systems using a variety of methods, but these configurations can be classified into one of two basic types: hull-mounts and pole-mounts. Each type of sonar mount has inherent benefits and potential problems that should be considered during data acquisition.\nA hull-mounted system is generally very stable, producing data with minimal noise due to vibration. A hullmounted configuration can be accomplished by notching the vessel keel and installing the sonar head along the keel line, attaching a mounting plate for the sonar head to the vessel hull, or cutting a box into the hull and creating a retractable mount for the sonar head. The flow of water along a vessel hull can create air bubbles, which may cause noise in a hull-mounted system. This problem should be considered when designing a hull-mount system. Note: The aforementioned retractable mounting system is essentially a hybrid of a hull-mount and a polemount. Benefits and drawbacks associated with each type of configuration should be considered when designing and installing such a system.\nA pole-mounted system is often the quickest and least intrusive mounting configuration. In its simplest form, the sonar head is mounted to a large pole that can be pivoted into the water during data acquisition, then pivoted back out and secured to minimize drag during transits. When using a pole-mounted system, it is critical that the sonar can be both reliably deployed to a repeatable position (with respect to the vessel reference frame) and adequately stabilized during data acquisition. Pins or guy-wires are often used to help with system stabilization. Noise due to vibration of the mounting pole at certain vessel speeds is a common problem with pole-mounted systems.\nMany MBES systems are capable of recording acoustic back-scatter data. Multibeam backscatter is intensity data that can be processed to create low resolution imagery. Backscatter is co-registered with the bathymetry data and is often used to assist with bathymetric data interpretation and post-processing. To optimize a system for backscatter data quality, refer to the manufacturer's documentation. However, the hydrographer should be cognizant that adjusting a MBES system to enhance backscatter data may detrimentally affect bathymetry data quality.\nAuxiliary sensors are normally used for acquiring data to correct MBES soundings for vessel attitude, position, and sound speed. Time synchronization of all sensor inputs is critical when acquiring MBES data, and there are several methods which can be used to accomplish this. If using a flat-faced MBES transducer array, it is also critical that sound speed be measured at the face of the transducer for beam forming and beam steering. For this type of system, a surface sound speed measuring instrument should be mounted at the sonar head, and its data input directly to the sonar processing unit.\nThe HYPACK/ HYSWEEP software package is commonly used by NOAA hydrographic field units to acquire MBES data. OCS guidelines for using HYPACK/HYSWEEP with MBES systems are described below. Users should also refer to the HYPACK User's Manual which can be found on the Hydrosoft website. Field units equipped with alternate software or systems incompatible with this software package should consult the appropriate user's manuals and/or contact the regional HSTP Field Support Liaison for guidance.\n69\n\n\f3.2.4.1 HYPACK / HYSWEEP\nHYSWEEP is an additional module available for the HYPACK software package discussed in section 3.2.3.1 of this manual. HYSWEEP enables the hydrographer to record both MBES and SSS data, and runs simultaneously with HYPACK. The HYPACK base program enables precise survey line navigation for MBES operations. Many of the procedures required for VBES data acquisition in HYPACK also apply to MBES and SSS data acquisition using HYSWEEP.\nBasic information for using the HYSWEEP software module is provided in this manual. For more detailed information about the HYSWEEP program, refer to the HYSWEEP User's Manual, which can be found on the Hydrosoft website.\n3.2.4.1.1 System Setup\nSystem setup for HYSWEEP consists of adding MBES system devices in the HYSWEEP Hardware configuration to enable communication with the sonar system and the HYPACK parent program. Note: HYSWEEP software can not be used to manipulate the sonar system settings. Any sonar setting changes must be performed using the sonar manufacturer's software interface. The HYSWEEP Hardware menu is accessible through the HYPACK Hardware menu. No vessel or hardware offsets should be entered in HYSWEEP, as it is OCS's policy to apply corrections and offsets to data during post-processing. Additional devices may also be added to the HYPACK hardware configuration for displaying multibeam data (nadir depth and matrix data) in the HYPACK survey window. Refer to Appendix 3 for detailed instructions for the standard setup of HYPACK and HYSWEEP devices (HYSWEEP Device Setup SOP.pdf).\nTo record data using HYSWEEP, a Project must exist in HYPACK. HYPACK Project creation is discussed in section 3.2.3.1.1 . Be certain to save each newly created Project with a unique name, or all changes will be lost when another Project is loaded. HYSWEEP files will be recorded to the same directory selected in HYPACK.\n3.2.4.1.2 Recording Data\nRecording data using the HYSWEEP module of HYPACK is nearly identical to logging data directly in HYPACK, as described in section 3.2.3.1.2 . Typically both programs are run simultaneously. Data logging can be controlled in either the HYPACK or the HYSWEEP program using the same commands and keyboard shortcuts. The two survey programs will begin/end logging simultaneously when a record or stop recording command is given in either one.\nFor OCS hydrographic surveys, HYSWEEP data shall be logged in ASCII HSX (HYSWEEP Survey Extension) format. While logging data, the HYSWEEP main survey window should be used to monitor logging and device alarms. MBES or SSS data can be displayed and monitored in real-time using windows selected under the View menu. Range scales for depth and beam width are accessed under the View > Options menu, and must be set to the appropriate values according to expected water depth or data will not be displayed in the survey windows (though it will still be logged). Multibeam display options, quality control tests, coverage map settings, and heave, pitch, and roll correction options are also accessed under View > Options menu. Note: the option to \"Apply Heave, Pitch, and Roll Corrections\" is used for display purposes only, and will not affect the raw recorded data.\n70\n\n\f3.2.5 Diver Least Depth Gauge (DLDG) Data\nA Diver Least Depth Gauge can be used by NOAA hydrographic field units to determine or verify the least depth of a feature. Depth is determined by comparing a pressure value at a feature's least depth to a surface pressure and correlating this difference to water depth based on the local water density. For more detailed DLDG information, refer to the document DLDG.pdf in Appendix 3.\nAt each dive site, a surface DLDG pressure must be recorded. OCS recommends taking a surface reading both before and after the dive, then averaging the two surface values for post-processing. Divers should survey the entire feature to identify the point of least depth. Once the least depth point is located, the DLDG should be placed level with this point and a pressure reading determined. Pressure values will vary with surface sea action, so a value eye averaged over a period of a few seconds should be recorded. A buoy marker should then be moved to the point of least depth so that a DGPS position can be obtained from the surface. If time permits and the item is complex, it is beneficial to record dimensions and make a quick sketch, noting the point of least depth. At the conclusion of the dive, a sound speed profile must be conducted in the vicinity using a Sea-Bird SEACAT profiler to determine local water density. Using a SEACAT system enables the DLDG pressures to be processed with Velocipy software.\n3.3 Acoustic Backscatter Acquisition\nNOAA hydrographic field units use a variety of sonar systems to acquire acoustic backscatter data. Side scan sonars (SSS) collect backscatter imagery and are preferred for their object detection capabilities. MBES systems can record seafloor acoustic backscatter data that are collocated with their range and angle measurements. Although acquisition of seafloor acoustic backscatter may be required in the project instructions and processed MBES backscatter may assist with determination of seabed characteristics when planning bottom sample operations, it does not meet OCS object detection criteria for hydrographic surveys. While it is also possible to collect water column backscatter with MBES, collection of this data is not expected or discussed further.\n3.3.1 Side Scan Sonar (SSS) Data\nSide scan sonar systems and configurations vary among NOAA hydrographic field units. Traditional SSS operations consist of a sonar body, or \"towfish,\" which is towed behind a vessel via a cable and winch system. During operations, transducers located on each side of the towfish emit an acoustic signal that ensonifies a wide swath of seabed. The frequency of the signal varies from system to system, typically ranging between 100 and 500 kHz. Lower frequencies will increase the maximum range scale of a SSS, but imagery quality and resolution increases with higher frequencies. The amplitude of returning echoes from the seafloor are recorded and georeferenced based on the return time series. The intensity of the SSS return signal will also be affected by the acoustic reflectivity of the sea floor. For example, rock and metal objects are better reflectors than sand or mud. If the seafloor is flat, the return signal will include amplitude values at regular intervals along the entire range scale.\nHowever, if a scour is present or an object is elevated from the sea floor, a portion of the return signal will be irregularly spaced in time. This interruption causes an acoustic shadow, or a lack of return signal, along a portion of the range scale. This basic side scan sonar theory of operation is illustrated in Figure 3.1.\n71\n\n\fFigure 3.1: Basic side scan sonar theory of operation\nSide scan systems are typically towed at depth to increase sonar grazing angles and object detection capability. For optimum object detection, OCS requires maintaining a towfish height of 8-20% of the operating range scale. NOAA's hydrographic field units effectively use both towed and hull-mounted SSS configurations. Each type of configuration has inherent benefits and potential problems that should be considered during data acquisition.\nIn towed configurations, towfish height is controlled by a combination of vessel speed and cable out. Although a towed configuration will maximize object detection abilities in various water depths, a certain amount of positioning error is inherent in any towed system. Because of this additional error source, SSS data are rarely used for final positioning of a feature. For hull-mounted configurations, position data are more accurate and operations can be conducted safely and effectively in shallow waters. However, since a hard-mounted system can not be lowered into the water column, sonar grazing angles will be directly affected by the water depth. As depth increases, object detection capabilities will decrease. It may not be possible to meet object detection criteria in deeper waters with a hull-mounted configuration.\nNote: When operating a towed SSS system, towfish height should be carefully monitored. If a sonar grounding is imminent, increasing vessel speed will typically raise the towfish.\nSonarPro software is commonly used by NOAA hydrographic field units to acquire SSS data. OCS guidelines for using SonarPro is described below. Users should also refer to the SonarPro Operation Manual, which can be found on the Hydrosoft website. Field units equipped with alternate software/systems incompatible with this software package should consult the appropriate user's manuals and/or contact the regional HSTP Field Support Liaison for guidance.\n3.3.1.1 SonarPro\nSonarPro, is a comprehensive software package compatible with the Klein 5000 Multibeam & Klein 3000 Dual Frequency SSS systems. In addition to display and recording of SSS data, SonarPro includes a capability for managing sonar targets which is useful when performing emergency response surveys. Detailed information about SonarPro can be found in the SonarPro Operation Manual.\n72\n\n\f3.3.1.1.1 System Setup\nSince SonarPro is specifically designed to operate with Klein System 5000 and 3000 side scan sonars, system setup requirements are minimal. Klein System 5000 and 3000 sonars must be booted using a program called vxWorks. (OCS recommends that the boot process be monitored using a HyperTerminal connection between the acquisition computer and Klein TPU.) The vxWorks program will differ depending on which sonar system is being used (5000 or 3000), allowing SonarPro to automatically detect and configure for the type of system to which it is connecting.\nNote: If using both 5000 and 3000 systems on the same acquisition system, be certain that the vxWorks file corresponding to the current system configuration is loaded in the \"klein\" directory before booting the sonar.\n\n3.3.1.1.2 Recording Data\nOnce the SSS has been booted, SonarPro software should be started (or if already running, select the towfish button from the main SonarPro display window to connect to the sonar). The user will be prompted to enter the Klein TPU Internet Protocol (IP) address to establish a connection between the acquisition computer and the sonar system. After creating a connection to the TPU, a Survey Wizard window will open that can be used to set up a data logging directory and target parameters. (The wizard may also be bypassed and accessed later from the main tool bar.) SonarPro will automatically display a Sonar Viewer window with SSS waterfall and towfish controls allowing the operator to start and stop the sonar from pinging. Once the operator is satisfied with the primary system setting choices, he/she should save the session by executing the Save State-Registry option under the Sessions menu. Saving State-Registry will cause SonarPro to open in this configuration the next time the software is opened.\n\n3.3.1.1.2.1 Towfish Setup\n\nTowfish setup is accessed through the Towfish button in the Sonar Viewer window. OCS recommended setup values are listed in Table 3.1. When conducting standard OCS hydrographic surveys, the most efficient SSS range scale should be used, as described in section 2.5.3.1.2 . SonarPro will automatically select an optimal pulse length for the user defined range scale.\n\nSonar Setting\n\nHigh Frequency\n\nLow Frequency\n\nSonar Range\n\nSet for maximum efficiency according Set for Maximum efficiency according to\n\nto depth\n\ndepth\n\nPulse Length Despeckle Sonar Image Sonar Resolution Side Scan System State TPU Responder Control Responder Frequency Towfish Speed Speed of Sound\n\nDefault\n\nDefault\n\nOff\n\nOff\n\nNormal\n\nNormal\n\nDefault\n\nDefault\n\nOff\n\nOff\n\n28.5\n\n28.5\n\nDetermine by GPS\n\nDetermine by GPS\n\n150000 cm/s\n\n150000 cm/s\n\nTable 3.1: Recommended Towfish Setup\n\n73\n\n\f3.3.1.1.2.2 Cable Out and Layback\nThe Cable Out window is accessed either using the Cable Out button or from inside the Layback window by selecting the External Cable Out Source button. Cable out values can be entered manually or automatically through external cable out sources.\nNote: When entering manual cable out, new values will not take effect until the user clicks the \"Apply\" button.\nThe cable out source and settings will vary depending on the system configuration. The operator should verify that Sonar Pro is reading the correct cable out values before logging data.\nThe hydrographer may want to enter vessel layback parameters (i.e., offsets from the navigation source to the sheave) so that SonarPro can generate accurate real-time positions for targets. Entering these offset values is important when investigating targets on the fly, such as during emergency response surveys. Vessel layback parameters are accessed through the Layback button in the SonarPro window. Save and apply the layback parameters by selecting the \"Store Layback Parameters\" button.\nNote: Entering layback offset values will only affect the calculated positions of targets selected during acquisition. Logged vessel navigation will not be affected, and towfish position should be calculated during post-processing in CARIS.\n3.3.1.1.2.3 Data Display\nIndividual data display windows can be selected from the Window tab of the main SonarPro screen. If using a Klein 3000, separate SSS Sonar Viewer windows should be opened to display both low frequency (100 kHz) and high frequency (500 kHz) data. Since high frequencies provide higher resolution data, this data should be viewed in the primary display window. However, low frequency data should also be monitored as it may pick up features missed by the high frequency.\nThe user may want to display charts in SonarPro for navigation purposes. For the navigation window to work properly, the user must first copy the desired *.BSB and *.KAP raster chart files to the sub-folder designated for charts (commonly labeled Maptech) during SonarPro installation. It is recommended that only the charts needed for a given work area be maintained in the chart folder to minimize software loading time. Note: If attempting to display multiple charts, the charts must all have the same projection. Skewed raster charts will not display in SonarPro.\nSonarPro provides two types of informational alarms, towfish altitude and towfish roll. It is strongly recommended that the towfish altitude alarm be set to visually and (if possible) audibly alert the user when this value falls below 5 meters. Towfish roll is a less critical value, and this alarm can be used at the hydrographer's discretion.\n3.3.1.1.2.4 Data Logging\nSonarPro provides the option of logging SSS data in either *.XTF format or Klein's proprietary Sensor Data Format (*.SDF). OCS's standard policy is to log SonarPro data using the *.SDF format. The *.SDF format logs vessel position and cable out values, but not towfish position. A towfish position will be calculated during postprocessing in CARIS. To begin logging *.SDF data, select the Record SDF button in the Sonar Data Recorder window. Maximum file size is set by specifying the maximum number of minutes per disk file in the data logging window. A maximum file size between 30 and 45 minutes is recommended based on field unit experience.\n74\n\n\fNote: If using HYPACK software for vessel navigation and logging bathymetry data, HYPACK and SonarPro must be started and stopped independently.\n\n3.3.2 Multibeam Echosounder Seafloor Backscatter\nThe acquisition of multibeam echosounder seafloor backscatter may be required in the project instructions. MBES backscatter may be used to supplement hydrographic data for non-charting purposes. See section 6.2 of the HSSD for further instructions on MBES backscatter requirements in Appendices 4 for standard operating procedures on processing MBES backscatter data.\n\n3.4 Position and Attitude Data\nNOAA field units often measure position and attitude data using a single piece of equipment, the POS/MV (Position and Orientation System for Marine Vessels), manufactured by Applanix. Alternately, a combination of systems may be used to measure position, heading, and heave/pitch/roll individually.\n\n3.4.1 Applanix POS/MV\nThe Applanix POS/MV is a GNSS-aided Inertial Navigation System. It consists of two dual-frequency GNSS receivers, an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), and a POS Computer System (PCS). The IMU and GNSS receivers are complementary sensors; data from one are used to filter and constrain errors from the other, resulting in high accuracy position and heading data. AGNSS Azimuth Measurement Subsystem (GAMS) is used to aid the POS/ MV in determining heading. GAMS heading aiding increases the system's achievable heading measurement accuracy, independent of latitude or vessel maneuvers. Additionally, the IMU senses linear acceleration and angular motion along the three major axes of the vessel to determine heave, pitch, and roll.\nPOS/MV Controller software allows the user to interact with the PCS for purposes such as performing calibrations and monitoring data accuracy. When acquiring data for OCS hydrographic surveys, POS/MV User Accuracy parameters shall be set such that the error values identified in Table 3.2 are not exceeded. If these User Accuracy parameters can not be met, the field unit shall contact the regional HSTP Field Support Liaison for guidance.\n\nData Parameter\n\nMaximum Allowable Error\n\nAttitude (Roll/Pitch)\n\n0.05 degrees\n\nHeading\n\n0.05 degrees\n\nPosition\n\n2.5 meters at 1 sigma\n\nVelocity\n\n1.0 m/s\n\nTable 3.2: Maximum Allowable POS/MV Error for OCS Surveys\n\nThe POS/MV Controller Program should be monitored continuously during survey data acquisition to ensure that the system is functioning properly and accuracy parameters are not exceeded. Occasionally, GAMS will experience difficulty determining heading parameters. Three common GAMS problems and corresponding solutions recommended by Applanix are described in Table 3.3.\n\n75\n\n\fPOS/MV Symptom\n\nCause of Problem\n\nRecommended Solution\n\n1.

The \"Invalid Installation\nParameters\" fault is red\n\nPOS/MV has resolved the wrong quadrant.\n\nCycle system to \"Standby\" and back to \"Navigate\".\n\nTable 3.3: Common GAMS Problems and Recommended Fixes.\n\nRefer to the appropriate Applanix POS/MV User's Manual, found on the Hydrosoft website, for additional information on the POS/MV system.\n\n3.4.1.1 Differential Correction\nGPS accuracy is improved by applying correctors from land-based differential radio beacons. The POS/MV system uses these differential corrections (RTCM SC-104 messages) when determining vessel position. However, the POS/MV system does not include a differential receiver. A separate receiver must be serially integrated into the POS/MV configuration to obtain these messages.\nNOAA hydrographic field units should use differential corrections from the United States Coast Guard (USCG) radio beacon closest in distance to the survey area, if possible. If a beacon receiver is capable of monitoring more than one radio beacon frequency, the unit should be set such that only one beacon station will be used. Allowing only one beacon frequency will prevent the receiver from switching to another beacon station without the operator's knowledge, which could cause erratic positioning and make determining the source of correctors difficult. It may be necessary to use an alternate radio beacon station if the preferred beacon is not functioning properly. In such cases, the use of this secondary differential beacon should be noted in the data acquisition log.\n\n3.4.1.1.1 Portable DGPS Reference Stations\nIf differential correctors are not available from a USCG radio beacon, a portable DGPS reference station can be set up by a field unit. A DGPS Reference station (Figure 3.2) consists of an L1/L2 GPS receiver, a radio transmitter, a radio receiver, a VHF antenna, tripods or light brackets, marine batteries, solar panels, a timer, and a laptop computer.\n76\n\n\fWhen choosing a site for DGPS reference station installation, the hydrographer should set it in a convenient place with good VHF line of sight to survey area and clear view of GPS satellites overhead (substantially clear sky all around from 10 degrees above horizon \u00ad see Appendix 3 (User's Guide for GPS Observations.pdf for more information). Effective ranges of Portable DGPS Reference Stations will be a factor of obstructions within the line of sight and antennae height, nominally 15 km can be used as a rule of thumb. Consider in particular the following locations:\n\u00b7 setup over tidal bench mark: provides connection between tidal and GPS correctors \u00b7 setup over other existing control mark: provides check with prior survey work \u00b7 least favorite: establish a new control mark (monumentation instructions available from NGS) Find existing control marks using the \"datasheets\" link from National Geodetic Survey http://geodesy.noaa.gov/ If no accurate coordinates exist for your control mark, submit a survey data file to OPUS http://www.ngs.noaa. gov/OPUS/. For maximum accuracy, submit two 6-hour files (see section 3.5.3 and average the resultant coordinates (if OPUS results do not agree within 2cm, consult with NGS). Occasional repetition of this OPUS solution is recommended to provide confidence checks. Note: OPUS will soon allow archiving of geodetic control directly from the website. To allow this, record photos of the mark and a description of the mark location (see draft requirements here: http://beta.ngs.noaa.gov/OPUS/ ). Instructions for setting up the beacon are provided with the kit and will not be provided here. Check the entire beacon system by placing a roving receiver in a stable spot and tracking the position for 24 hours (see section 3.2.2. of the HSSD). If the resulting scatter plot (from the Trimble Pathfinder ProXRS or other receiver software) shows that more than 5% of positions exceed 5 meters from the average, this is an indication that there is a problem. Otherwise, save a screen shot of the scatter plot for your files. Both a one-time DGPS site confirmation and a weekly position uncertainty check are required per section 3.2.2 and3.4 (resp.) of the HSSD. The weekly QC procedure is detailed in section 3.4.1.1.3 below.\nFigure 3.2: DGPS Reference Station\n77\n\n\f3.4.1.1.2 WAAS-corrected GPS data\nNOAA prefers all in-house and contract hydrographers to use USCG Differential GPS (DGPS) as the primary means of positioning. However, there are some project areas for which reliable DGPS coverage is unavailable or inadequate. In some case, coverage may be provided by the Federal Aviation Administration's Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS). When working in inshore areas that are relatively close to WAAS reference stations, WAAS may be able to replace DGPS as the primary means of positioning if prior permission is obtained from the Chief of the Hydrographic Systems and Technology Program in NOAA's Coast Survey Development Laboratory. WAAS can be an option if it can be shown that WAAS meets the positioning accuracy requirements listed in the HSSD. The procedures for discovering if WAAS may serve as the primary positioning method are listed below.\n\u00b7 Identify a point ashore with position known to ~0.5m accuracy (either a point surveyed yourselves with precision GPS methods, or retrieved from the NGS database at http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/OPUS/). This site should be in close proximity to the survey area, and have a relatively unobstructed sky view to maximize the available GPS constellation.\n\u00b7 Occupy the point with your WAAS-enabled receiver for at least 24 hours, logging position data at no less than 1 minute intervals.\n\u00b7 Assess WAAS position accuracy and precision by constructing a scatter plot of the 24-hour time series, and computing the average WAAS position. 95% of the WAAS positions must fall within 5m of both the high accuracy mark position and the average WAAS position.\n\u00b7 Before acquiring WAAS-corrected hydrographic data, a brief report describing methods, data, test results, and your plans for quality control shall be submitted to the Chief of the Hydrographic Systems and Technology Program in NOAA's Coast Survey Development Laborator\n3.4.1.1.3 PPK/RTK Base Station Position Uncertainty Checks\nIf a PPK/RTK GNSS base station is maintained and used by the field unit to improve horizontal positioning and/ or survey to the ellipsoid, a weekly base station uncertainty check shall be performed (see section 3.4 of the HSSD).\nNOAA hydrographic units shall use the known location of the base station used during post processing/RTK corrector generation as the \"Known\" location for the check. NGS OPUS shall be used to determine the Known location position. A position uncertainty check shall be performed each week of occupation by submitting a 6 hour session file to OPUS and verifying the \"Check\" position against the Known position.\nNOAA hydrographic units shall use the NGS program INVERS3D to perform the weekly position uncertainty check of the base station. INVERS3D is available as either a free download or web based program from NGS http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/PC_PROD/Inv_Fwd/. The procedure for performing the weekly check is listed below:\n78\n\n\f\u00b7 Submit both the Known position and Check position GNSS session files to NGS OPUS \u00b7 Run INVERS3D from the downloadable executable or web based form \u00b7 Enter the First Station (Known position) coordinates as Geodetic coordinates\nFigure 3.3: Base Station Known Coordinates \u00b7 Enter the Second Station (Check position) coordinates as Geodetic coordinates\nFigure 3.4: Second Station Coordinates \u00b7 Save the output into a file using the naming convention Station ID_QC_Week Number of check.txt (ex.\n9237_QC_33.txt) \u00b7 Give First Station name using the naming convention Station ID_Known (ex. 9237_Known) \u00b7 Give Second Station name using the naming convention Station ID_Check (ex. 9237_Check)\n79\n\n\fFigure 3.5: Base Station Naming \u00b7 Examine the results of the text file. The Mark-to-mark distance (D) shall be:\nFigure 3.6: Base Stattion Uncertainty Check Results 3.4.1.2 True Heave Heave data is calculated using a double integration of acceleration over a period of time. When recording heave in real-time, the calculation is performed using only past measurements of acceleration. An improved estimate of vessel low-frequency heave can be calculated by performing the integration over a time period centered on the time of interest, resulting in a \"true heave\" value (also referred to as \"delayed heave\"). POS/MV TrueHeave is effective across long-period wave conditions (16- to 30-second period swell), whereas a real-time heave filter tends to exhibit its most notable artifacts in such conditions (>16 seconds). Note: TrueHeave does not replace the need for dynamic draft corrections or water level corrections. TrueHeave is logged using the POS/MV Controller software, via the Ethernet connection to the POS/MV PCS. TrueHeave data logging must be controlled separately from the primary data acquisition software, but it can be continuously recorded throughout the day. The TrueHeave filter requires a period of up to five (5) minutes after it has been enabled to initialize. The filter uses vertical acceleration data three (3) minutes past real time; hence, logging must continue for at least three (3) minutes past the ending time of survey line data acquisition. The time\n80\n\n\fbase used for TrueHeave data, \"Heave Time 1\", is user selectable in the POS/MV Controller software. For OCS hydrographic surveys, UTC (default) should be selected, not GPS time. Refer to the POS MV with TrueHeave document, found on the Hydrosoft website, for more information regarding the theory, operation, and setup of TrueHeave.\nTrueHeave files are applied to survey data during CARIS HIPS post-processing via the Load True Heave tool, as discussed in section 4.2.3.5 .\n3.4.1.3 POSPac Files\nThe POS Controller (POS VIEW) program is used to log POS PCS files that contain all the files necessary for IAPPK processing of SBET in POSPac. See Appendix 4 for (Ellipsoidally Referenced Survey SOP.pdf). Also, refer to the appropriate Applanix POS/MV User's Manual, found on the HydroSoft website, https://inside.nos. noaa.gov/hydrosoft/welcome.html , for additional information on the POS/MV system.\n3.4.2 Alternate Positioning Equipment\n3.4.2.1 Vessel-mounted DGPS Receivers\nNumerous types of differential positioning systems are available on the open market, including terrestrial based DGPS receivers as well as satellite based DGPS receivers. NOAA hydrographic field units planning to acquire hydrographic survey data with a positioning system not identified in this manual should contact the regional HSTP Field Support Liaison for guidance and review the system's accuracies to confirm that survey specifications can be met. DGPS receivers that can automatically switch DGPS stations based on signal strength or distance from station should have these options disabled so that the receiver does not switch beacons while acquiring data. This can lead to horizontal shifts in data.\n3.4.2.1.1 Global Satellite-Based Augmentation System (GSBAS) correction\nIn situations where USCG DGPS correctors are not available and it is not feasible to set up a portable DGPS station, a field unit may choose to subscribe to a service such as NavCom Technologies StarFire network or C & C Technologies C-Nav network. These services utilize NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Real-Time GIPSY (RTG) Precise Point Positioning (PPP) technology to generate corrections and then broadcast them over L-Band communication satellites.\n3.4.2.2 Portable GPS Units\nIn some situations, such as shoreline verification, it is more efficient for the field unit to position features using a portable GPS unit. Various models of portable GPS units are available on the open market. Portable GPS units shall meet the horizontal accuracy requirements as stated in section 3 of the HSSD.\nThese systems and survey techniques are discussed in section 3.5.3 \u00ad Position Uncertainty and Precision.\n81\n\n\f3.4.3 Alternate Heading Sensors\n3.4.3.1 Gyroscopic Compass\nA gyroscopic (gyro) compass may be used to determine vessel heading. Gyro compasses use the effects of gravity and the Earth's rotation to produce a true north reference and may be mechanical by design or use fiber optic or laser technology. Ideally, a gyro compass should be installed on the centerline of the ship. When a gyro compass is used, the manufacturer's information should be reviewed carefully to determine if the system requires any user input such as vessel latitude and/or speed to achieve the specified heading accuracy and to identify approximately how much time is required for the system to slew when first powered up.\n3.4.3.2 Course Over Ground (COG)\nVessel course over ground (COG) can be used to calculate a smoothed vessel heading. This technique will not be appropriate when acquiring all types of hydrographic data. Generally, any system hard mounted to the vessel will require an instantaneous heading. Since towed systems will not be affected by every slight motion of the vessel, they can typically use a calculated COG heading without detrimentally affecting the survey data. It may be possible to adjust the smoothing factor associated with COG heading data. Manipulating the smoothing factor would allow the user to adjust the frequency with which heading is calculated or how many position points are used to estimate the vessel course.\n3.5 Ancillary Data\nTwo basic types of ancillary data are acquired in conjunction with OCS hydrographic surveys. The first type is used to correct sonar data and includes such measurements as sound speed and water levels, as well as horizontal and vertical control data. The second type consists of information that supports survey analyses beyond basic water depth measurements and object detection. Positions for aids to navigation (ATONs), bottom samples, shoreline determination, and Coast Pilot reviews are included in this second category.\n3.5.1 Sound Speed Data\nSound speed data are used by NOAA hydrographic field units for multiple purposes. Primarily, sound speed profiles of the entire water column are used to correct sounding data for the effects of refraction and varying speed of sound through water. Water column profiles are also used when processing absolute pressure data obtained by a DLDG so that a water depth can be calculated. Additionally, flat arrays and to a lesser extent, the far off nadir beams in curved arrays (of MBES systems) require a continual real time input of sound speed data at the sonar head for proper beam forming and beam steering. It should be noted that using incorrect sound speed at the transducer face in beam steering can seriously impact the proper computation of launch/receive angle of all offnadir beams on curved arrays.\nWhen acquiring sound speed profiles to correct bathymetry, OCS recommends taking casts in the deepest portion of the project area that best represents the surveyed area for which the profile will be applied. If data will be processed using Velocipy software, the sound velocity speed profile can be extended up to 30% of the cast's overall depth (in water depths less than 300 meters), providing more flexibility for cast locations . In water depths greater than 300 meters, the cast data will be extended to the maximum depth of historical data files loaded in the Velocipy program. The required frequency of casts will be dependent on the survey area, but OCS strongly recommends that a cast be performed at least every four hours during MBES data acquisition and once per week for VBES data.\n82\n\n\fThe Sea-Bird SEACAT conductivity, temperature, and depth profiler (CTD), Odom DigibarPro, and Rolls- Royce Moving Vessel Profiler (MVP) are commonly used by NOAA hydrographic field units to acquire sound speed data. Position information will be required by Velocipy software for data processing and the user must be certain to record the most accurate GPS position possible. Data acquisition is briefly discussed for each of these systems below.\n3.5.1.1 Sea-Bird SEACAT\nThe SEACAT is a portable, user-deployed, battery-operated instrument, typically housed in a protective cage. The SEACAT records water salinity, temperature, and pressure (i.e., depth) during deployment and retrieval. Sampling rate depends upon the CTD model being used, and is typically between 2-4 samples per second. These data are processed using NOAA's Velocipy software to calculate a sound speed profile for the water column. Prior to performing a cast, OCS recommends that the SEACAT memory be cleared by performing a Pre-Cast Setup and the instrument status be reviewed using Velocipy (see Velocipy Operation Manual, included on the Hydrosoft website). If the SEACAT voltage is less than the following values listed below, the instrument batteries should be changed:\n\u00b7 SBE 19plus: 9.5 volts\n\u00b7 SBE 19: 7 volts\nIn both cases, the user is told to inspect the battery cut-off value in the status message. The battery should, at the very least, be one volt greater than the cut-off value.\nWhen conducting SEACAT casts, using the SBE 19plus, the instrument should be lowered and held just below the water's surface for about 1 minute to flush air out of the salinity cell. After soaking the instrument beneath the surface, the user should slowly lower the instrument through the water column.\nWhen conducting SEACAT casts, using the SBE 19, the 3-2-1 rule of thumb must still be followed. The instrument should be turned on and allowed to sit on deck for 3 minutes while the sensors settle and form baseline measurements. Next, lower and hold the instrument just below the water's surface for 2 minutes. Finally, deploy it at a rate of approximately 1 meter of depth per second.\nWith either the SBE 19 or the SBE19plus, lowering the instrument too quickly may not provide enough data points for an accurate water column profile. In areas with lenses of fresh water or other complex sound speed variation near the surface, the instrument should be lowered slowly (in some cases, much less than 1 meter/ second) by hand through the first 5-10 meters of water in order to accurately sample the sound speed. After the instrument has descended through the initial 5-10 meters, the user should proceed to drop it at a rate of about 1 meter/second.\nRefer to the Sea-Bird SBE User's Manuals, found on the Hydrosoft website, for additional operating instructions.\n3.5.1.2 Odom DigibarPro\nThe DigibarPro Profiling Sound Velocimeter is a portable, user-deployed instrument. The DigibarPro system includes a high frequency \"sing-around\" transducer and a reflector precisely spaced to facilitate measuring the speed of sound in water by continuously transmitting and receiving a signal across a known separation distance. The sing-around frequency and associated depth information are recorded at a rate of 10 samples per second. In\n83\n\n\fmany OCS applications, DigibarPro systems have been mounted to or near a MBES transducer to directly measure sound speed at the sonar face; however, some units deploy this instrument to obtain full water column profiles. Recorded DigibarPro sound speed profiles can be uploaded to a PC and processed using NOAA's Velocipy software. Refer to the DIGIBAR-PRO Profiling Sound Velocimeter Operation Manual, found on the Hydrosoft website, for additional operating instructions.\n3.5.1.3 Rolls-Royce Moving Vessel Profiler (MVP)\nThe Moving Vessel Profiler (MVP) is an automated winch system that deploys various payloads such as a free fall fish (FFF) that can be fitted with a sound speed sensor. The FFF is configured to \"fly\" at a specified depth until deployed by use of a \"messenger\" on the cable. Once at the depth limit, the winch is stopped manually and the drag forces on the FFF cause it to rise toward the surface due to the ship's forward motion while the slack cable is pulled in by the winch. For OCS operations, the messenger is set on the tow cable so that the FFF flies at survey transducer depth while the vessel is moving at survey speed. The FFF can either be user-deployed or deployed automatically by the computer at a defined time interval to a user-defined depth or a preset depth off bottom (typically 10 meters). The FFF is automatically recovered to transducer depth, ready to be deployed again. Because of the large number of casts that can be recorded by the MVP in a short time frame, it is convenient to batch process the sound velocity profiles using Velocipy.\nNote: Sound velocity profiles created by the MVP must be processed using Velocipy.\nRefer to the MVP Operation and Maintenance Manual and the MVP Controller Software Manual, found on the Hydrosoft website, for additional information on this system and to section 1.5.2.3 . .\n3.5.1.4 Reson SVP 70\nThe Reson SVP 70 is a portable sound velocity probe consisting of a 6.5 inch, 2.2 pound probe which connects to a topside computer. The SVP 70 measures the sound speed up to 20 times per second in a direct measurement by transmitting a sound pulse and detecting its time to travel a well-defined path length. The transmitted signal is generated using waveform techniques that yield optimal conditions for timing the arrival of the returning signal, which is digitized at high frequency and high resolution. The timing is established using a high-stability clock oscillator.\nThe SVP 70 should be mounted at or near the head of a flat face MBES transducer to ensure that valid sound speed data is being utilized during the beam forming process.\n3.5.2 Vertical Datum Transformation Data\nTide and water level data are used by NOAA hydrographic field units to reduce bathymetric data to local \"chart datum\", most often mean lower low water (MLLW). The hydrographer should be aware of the difference between tide data and water level data. Tides refer to the changes in water levels due to astronomical forces only. Tides are the only water level changes that can be scientifically predicted. Water level data refer to the actual (i.e., observed) changes in water level due to the combined effects of astronomical forces, wind, rain, freshwater runoff, and other meteorological events. It should be noted that predicted tides may differ significantly from actual water levels. Typically, inland water level stations are more susceptible to meteorological effects; thus, tide predictions for coastal water level stations can be expected to more accurately represent actual water levels than those for inland stations. Stations in relatively shallow water or with a small tidal range are also highly susceptible to meteorological effects, making water levels difficult to accurately predict.\n84\n\n\fFor projects involving ERS, the hydrographer shall utilize approved vertical datum transformation methods (e.g. VDatum, ERZT, and Constant Value) in lieu of traditional water levels to reduce the bathymetric data to chart datum. The accuracy of the vertical transformation process is highly dependent on Global Positioning Systems. Therefore, it is important for the hydrographer to recognize potential satellite ephemeris and clock errors related to variables such as orbital decay. These variables comprise and explain the components of orbital perturbations. As a result, orbital perturbations can alter satellite trajectories from its predicted path. This \"ephemeris error\" is the difference between the expected and actual orbital path. These deviations are corrected in post processing using rapid or precise ephemerides.\n3.5.2.1 Water Level Station Installation\nAlthough CO-OPS will install, operate, and maintain control water level stations, hydrographic field units may be required to install subordinate stations. If an installation will be necessary for a project, it will be stated in the Project Instructions. In such cases, CO-OPS will provide a recommended general area for the gauge. The field unit is responsible for performing reconnaissance to determine if the recommended location is feasible. If the initial location is determined to be unsuitable, the field unit shall recommend an alternate location for CO-OPS approval. Gauge installation, operation, and removal shall be performed and documented in accordance with section 4 of the HSSD and section 5.2.2.2.4 of this manual. A copy of CO-OPS' (Standing Project Instructions and Requirements For the Coastal and Great Lakes Water Level Stations) is included in Appendix 3.\n3.5.2.2 Bench Mark Recovery and Leveling\nA bench mark is a fixed physical object or marker (monumentation) set for stability and used as a reference to the vertical and/or horizontal datums. Bench marks in the vicinity of a water level station are used as the reference for the local tidal datums derived from the water level data. The vertical relationship between the bench marks and the water level sensor or tide staff is established by differential leveling. NOAA Hydrographic field units will often be required to install and/or recover benchmarks and perform leveling operations for applicable water level stations at the start and end of data acquisition for a project. Existing bench mark descriptions and locations can be found under the Products menu of the CO-OPS website http://www.tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov.\nEach water level station will have one bench mark, designated as the primary bench mark, that shall be leveled to on every run. Levels must be run between the water level sensor or tide staff and the required number of bench marks when the water level measurement station is installed, modified (e.g., water level sensor serviced, staff, or orifice replaced), for time series bracketing purposes, or prior to removal. Levels are required at least every six months during the station's operation, and are recommended after severe storms, hurricanes, or earthquakes to document stability. Levels run at subordinate stations operated for less than one-year shall be at least third-order. Any requirements for higher order levels will be specified in the Project Instructions for the project. Bench mark installation and gauge leveling shall be performed and documented in accordance with section 4 of the HSSD.\nBracketing levels to an appropriate number of marks (five for subordinate stations) are required (a) if a gauge is in operations for more than 30 days but less than 12 months (b) if final tides are required, or (c)) every 6 months for stations collecting data for long term hydrographic projects.\n85\n\n\f3.5.2.3 Water Level Data Retrieval Typically, predicted tides or preliminary water level data are applied to soundings during initial post-processing. As verified or final water level data become available, the best quality data should be applied to bathymetry. Field units can download six-minute preliminary water level data directly from the Products > Tides section of the COOPS website http://www.tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov within hours of data acquisition. Verified water level data should be available from the CO-OPS website within seven days if the station has been placed on the Hydro Hot List. If a station is not on the Hydro Hot List, verified data may take up to a month to be posted. Final water levels should be requested from CO-OPS, via a Request for Tides package that can be automatically generated using Pydro software. Guidance for submitting a Request for Tides is included in section 5.2.2.3.3 . 3.5.2.3.1 Hydro Hot List CO-OPS maintains a list of water level stations that are currently providing data for OCS hydrographic surveys. This list is referred to as the \"Hydro Hot List.\" If a water level station is on the Hydro Hot List, it is monitored by CO-OPS' Continuously Operating Real-Time Monitoring System (CORMS) and its data are given priority over other gauge data for office processing. Field units shall notify CO-OPS by e-mailing: nos.coops.hpt@noaa.gov and nos.coops.oetteam@noaa.gov when data acquisition begins for a new survey so that the associated water level stations can be put on the Hydro Hot List. Include the following information in the email: project name and number, start and end date, and the names of the required gauges. CO-OPS should also be advised when hydrographic survey data acquisition has been completed in an area so that stations can be removed from this list. The Hydro Hot List can be found at http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/hydro.shtml. 3.5.2.3.2 Fetchtides Fetchtides is a procedural program which allows a user to retrieve tides data from a variety of sources including data e-mailed from tidebot, data in local files, and live data available through CO-OPS's Web Services. fetchtides then provides a mechanism to store the imported data locally and then combine multiple days worth of data into one CARIS readable tide file.\n86\n\n\f3.5.3 GPS Horizontal and Vertical Positioning\nNOAA hydrography frequently requires GPS positioning of features in the survey area independent of depth sounding operations. Field units have a range of equipment and techniques at their disposal to perform these measurements. While each survey will have slightly different requirements, typical operations are summarized in Table 3.4. The rationale for recommended or required durations of GPS observations is given in Table 3.5. Exact requirements can be found in the NOS Hydrographic Surveys Specifications and Deliverables or the relevant Project Instructions.\n\nAccuracy Regime\n\nTypical System\n\nSub-Meter horizontal and/ or vertical.\n\nDual-frequency receiver;\nconstant height tripod\n\nTypical Technique\n\nTypical Applications\nWater level station geodetic benchmarks with\nvertical accuracy of 2 cm @ 95% confidence*\n\nTwo 6 hour occupations\nOPUS post-processing with\nprecise ephemeris\n\nportable DGPS Reference Station Control Points Horizontal Accuracy:\n3rd Order or better (~1m @ 95% confidence)\n\nRange Markers\n\nHorizontal: 0.1m @ 95% confidence\n\n0.5 - Meter Horizontal\n\nSingle Frequency Portable GPS Receiver\n(Trimble ProXRS or similar)\n\n5 minutes of static L1 GPS data and differential\ncorrection\n\nGround Control Point Positioning by\nNavigation Response Teams for the\nNational Geodetic Survey's Remote Sensing Division.\n\n1m @ 95% Confidence Interval\n\nSingle Frequency Portable GPS Receiver\n(Trimble ProXRS or similar)\n\n10 to15 minutes of static occupation\n\nFixed ATONs (beacons or lights)\n\nPost-processed differential correction\n(Pathfinder Office utility or similar)\n\nMooring Facility features used for zero\nvisibility docking\n\n5m @ 95% Confidence\nInterval\n\nSurvey Vessel DGPS or Single Frequency\nPortable GPS Receiver (Trimble ProXRS or similar)\n\nDP with offset, short static occupation, or roving as appropriate\n\nFloating ATONs\nGeneral Shoreline Features\n\nTable 3.4: Typical GPS Positioning Scenarios *Per requirements of the CO-OPS Users Guide for GPS Observations and NGS-58.\n\n87\n\n\fRecommended or Required Duration of Observation\n\nExplanation\n\nFor Horizontal or Vertical Positioning\n\n5 Minutes\n\nDue to advances in GPS technology, sub-meter horizontal positioning is now possible with an observation period of 5 minutes using the parameters found in Table 3.6\n\nHorizontal Only\n\n15 Minutes\n\nMinimum recommended for OPUSRS which may be a preferred alternative for much of your work.

If the hydrographer is using the same equipment, then it isn't true independence but it will give at least different satellites, different atmosphere, different ephemeris which could be an issue, at least theoretically. Whenever there is a convenient opportunity to collect more observations, it is recommended to do so and prove from repeated consistent OPUS results that you know where you are.\n\n88\n\n\f3.5.3.1 Sub-Meter GPS Positioning\n3.5.3.1.1.1 Equipment for Static Positioning\nOperations which require sub-meter accuracy measurements of horizontal and/or vertical position are generally accomplished with the following equipment:\n\u00b7 Dual Frequency (L1/L2) GPS receiver with internal logging, and appropriate batteries.\n\u00b7 L1/L2 ground plane GPS antenna.\n\u00b7 Antenna cable less than 10m in length. Shorter is better, but if you have or need longer (to protect receiver or observer), then use it. Cables should be treated gently to avoid lost or noisy signal which will decrease accuracy.\n\u00b7 Tripod or light bracket for antenna mounting (Fixed-height Tripod for high accuracy vertical measurements).\nThe following additional equipment is typically needed to install the GPS equipment:\n\u00b7 Magnetic Compass (for antenna orientation).\n\u00b7 Observation Log (see HorCon_VerCon_Obs_Log.pdf in Appendix 3.\n\u00b7 Eyebolts, rock drill, rope/cable, etc. as required to secure antenna for long duration observation sessions.\n\u00b7 Digital Camera for site documentation.\n3.5.3.1.2 Observations for Static Positioning\nSub-meter GPS positioning requires concurrent observations at one or more Continually Operating Reference Station (CORS) sites and/or other pre-existing control stations with accuracies of at least a 1st order triangulation (for sub-meter horizontal measurements) as well as vertical control for accurate vertical measurements. For best results, the control station should be within 75km of the measurement site. Longer distances may be unavoidable in remote areas but may necessitate longer observation sessions to achieve the same order of accuracy. Both CORS sites and supplemental reference station information is provided on the National Geodetic Survey CORS website: http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/CORS/.\nTo perform GPS observations, first assemble the tripod or light bracket (for fixed lighted ATONs) over the point for which a new position will be determined. Be certain that the antenna is plumb to the mark, oriented north, and level to the earth. Accurately measure the height of the antenna reference point.\nOnce the antenna has been properly set up, connect the GPS receiver and check that it has the expected number of satellites in view and is computing a position. If performing a vertical position measurement on the geodetic benchmark of a water level station, ensure that the Vertical Dilution of Precision (VDOP) is less than 6.0 (as required by the CO-OPS Users Guide for GPS Observations and NGS-58, included in Appendix 3). At sites with poor satellite visibility, it may be necessary to use a GPS constellation prediction tool such as the Trimble Planning software to schedule sessions for best available satellite geometry.\n89\n\n\fConfigure the GPS receiver to record GPS pseudo ranges for the appropriate amount of time to meet both accuracy specifications and post-processing requirements. There are several methods that can be used to postprocess GPS data; however, NOAA hydrographic field units typically use NGS's Online Positioning User's Service (OPUS), which utilizes data from three nearby CORS sites and is available at http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/OPUS. To ensure that the data can be processed using OPUS, the following guidelines should be followed during data acquisition:\n\u00b7 Recording intervals on the GPS receiver(s) should be set to 15s or some multiple that coincides with the three nearest CORS site sampling rates. Sampling rates for each CORS site may differ and can be reviewed on the NGS CORS website.\n\u00b7 If using more than one receiver for an observation session, all of the receivers should be set to the same recording interval, since there must be common data between all stations.\n\u00b7 Observation times should be a minimum of two hours. For a strong OPUS solution, at least two hours of good data are needed. NGS recommends four hours of good data to achieve horizontal accuracy of 0.035 m. For further information on positioning, refer to the following Users_Guide_for_GPS_Observations At Tide and Water Level Station Bench Marks: http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/pub.html\n\u00b7 OPUS can convert them to RINEX for most receivers. If not, before uploading GPS files to OPUS, convert them to RINEX2 format using the RINEX Conversion module included with the receiver manufacturer's software.\n\u00b7 Monitor the position and positional dilution of precision (PDOP) information displayed on the GPS receiver. PDOP is a unitless value that indicates the degree of position error in a measurement. Do not start logging data until PDOP is below six. Maintaining a PDOP less than six will help ensure that the observation file contains clean data that will not be rejected by quality control checks performed by OPUS. Note: Some systems will automatically begin logging data when powered on. In such cases, the user may need to manually stop a session once PDOP is below six, create a new session in the receiver, and start a new session so that data begin logging under a new file name. The first file can be easily deleted after downloading data.\n\u00b7 An observation log for every setup shall be completed by the observer(s) on site. A blank HorCon/Vercon Observation Log is included in Appendix 3 (HorCon_VerCon_Obs_Log.pdf).\nAdditional detail on processing GPS Observations with OPUS can be found in section 4.4.1 .\n3.5.3.1.3 Ellipsoidally Referenced Surveys\nERS vertical control is discussed in Appendix 4 of the FPM and in Chapter 9 of the HSSD.\n3.5.3.2 Meter-level GPS Positioning\nWhile horizontal position to 1m accuracy can be accomplished with the same equipment described above for higher accuracy measurements, it is often more efficient and convenient to utilize portable single frequency logging GPS receivers for this purpose. The Trimble ProXRS receiver with TSCe data collector or notebook PC is an example of this equipment commonly found in NOAA field unit inventories.\n90\n\n\fThe Trimble Pathfinder ProXRS is a backpack GPS system which combines a GPS receiver and a beacon differential receiver. Although a single frequency (L1) GPS receiver, the ProXRS is capable of logging carrier phase data, which can be post processed to recover significantly improved positional accuracy. With the addition of the TSCe data collector, this system can be used to acquire static point or roving line data, and immediately assign object types and attributes based on the S-57 catalog. Static position accuracies of 1m or better can be attained when the system is used to occupy a point for a minimum of approximately 10 minutes, and the resulting data is post-processed with Trimble Pathfinder Office software.\n3.5.3.2.1 System Software Two types of software are used to conduct operations with the Trimble Pathfinder unit. GPS Pathfinder Office software is used to create an initial configuration file for the ProXRS receiver and allows field personnel to postprocess logged GPS data, including converting data into Shapefiles, which can be exported to Pydro. Trimble TerraSync software runs on the TSCe data collector or notebook computer, and is used to control the ProXRS receiver and log and attribute data. Refer to the TerraSync Operation Guide found on the Hydrosoft website for specific information on this software.\n3.5.3.2.2 System Configuration Prior to acquiring data with the Trimble Pathfinder system, a project and configuration file must be created. Both of these tasks should be completed using GPS Pathfinder Office software, although field adjustments can be made to the configuration file using TerraSync. Refer to the GPS Pathfinder Office Getting Started Guide, found on the Hydrosoft website, for specific details on how to create a project and configuration file. Numerous parameters must be entered in the configuration file.

OCS recommends acquiring data at an elevation mask of 10\u00b0, and increasing the elevation angle to 15\u00b0 during postprocessing. If data will not be post-processed, a mask of 15\u00b0 should be used during acquisition. A copy of NOS NGS 58 is included in Appendix 3 (NGS-58.pdf).\n\n3.5.3.2.3 Data Dictionary\nThe Trimble Pathfinder Pro XRS uses a digital Data Dictionary to attribute data acquired with the unit. NOAA hydrographic field units shall use the Data Dictionary as a base for acquiring S57 attributed data. The Data Dictionary should be loaded into TerraSync on the GPS datalogger or PC being used to record data. Consult the GPS Pathfinder Office Getting Started Guide, found on the Hydrosoft website for further information on editing the Data Dictionary.\n\n3.5.3.2.4 Recording Data\nThe Trimble Pathfinder Pro XRS can record position data as points, lines, and areas. Recording procedures will vary depending upon the position accuracy required. In general, a single geographic position with real-time differential correctors applied should be accurate within 2-5 meters and adequate for positioning features such as large shoreline features and bottom samples. The TerraSync acquisition software also includes options for applying offsets to a position which can not be directly accessed. Position offsets can be defined by a distance and bearing from a recorded point (distance/bearing), distances from two recorded points (distance/distance), bearings from\n92\n\n\ftwo recorded points (bearing/bearing), distances from three recorded points (triple distance), or bearings from three recorded points (triple bearing). Distances and bearings can be either visually estimated or measured using a laser range finder and compass. Of these options, triple distance offsets measured with a laser range finder will provide the most accurate position, but this method may not always be feasible or necessary. The hydrographer should use the most efficient method of positioning that will meet data specifications.\nWhen recording line data, the operator can configure the Trimble Pathfinder Pro XRS to record positions at specified time intervals. For positioning linear shoreline features such as piers, hydrographic field unit experience has shown a 1 second recording interval to be sufficient in most cases. A shorter interval may be necessary for more complex features, or multiple single points may more accurately portray a feature that requires indirect routes between corner points such as a cluttered pier. Refer to the GPS Pathfinder Systems User Guide, found on the Hydrosoft website, for detailed information on Trimble Pathfinder Pro XRS operating procedures.\nHigher accuracy positioning can be obtained by static occupation of a site for multiple position measurements, and/or post-processing ProXRS data with the Trimble Pathfinder Office software's Differential Correction Utility.\n3.5.3.3 Special Instructions for Positioning Aids to Navigation (ATONs)\nPositions and characteristics for all ATONs within a survey area shall be visually observed and compared to both the largest scale chart and current USCG Light List information during survey operations.\nNote: Any ATON that is not serving its intended purpose, off-station, damaged, otherwise compromised, or uncharted and is determined by the field unit to present a hazard to navigation shall be immediately reported to the local USCG district.\nNOAA's Update Service Branch (USB) will assign specific ATONs (fixed type only) which require positioning based on NOAA's Critical Corrections Database (CRIT) and/or USCG Integrated Aids to Navigation Information System (IATONIS) database records. Information for assigned ATONs will be provided on the Project CD/DVD. Additional ATONs may be positioned at the field unit's discretion if determined to be navigationally significant. Unless specific positioning methods or accuracies are assigned in the Project Instructions, ATONs throughout the survey area shall be investigated, and positioned if necessary, in accordance with the following guidance:\n\u00b7 Assigned Charted Fixed ATONs \u00ad If possible, the field unit shall position each fixed ATON assigned by MCD. Assigned ATONs shall be positioned to an accuracy of less than one meter, at a 95% confidence level, unless otherwise specified - such as range markers, which shall be positioned to within 4 cm precision and reported to one-thousandth of a second of latitude (0.001'). Many NOAA hydrographic field units meet this accuracy criteria by performing static GPS observations for minimum a period of 10 to 15 minutes and post-processing position data using correctors from the nearest CORS station (e.g., using the Differential Correction utility in GPS Pathfinder Office software as described in 3.5.3.2.1 ). If obtaining this level of accuracy is unfeasible, but the field unit is able to acquire a higher quality position than that in the current database record, an upgraded position should be determined and included in the ATON Report (see section 5.2.2.3.4 . Acquisition methods and limitations should be described in the comments section for that ATON.\n\u00b7 Unassigned Charted Fixed ATONs \u00ad Charted fixed ATONs will not be assigned if a position accurate to less than one meter, at a 95% confidence level, has already been determined. If an unassigned fixed aid is observed to be significantly off station based on the largest scale chart, the hydrographer should review the USCG Local Notice to Mariners (LNM) for a discrepancy report on the aid. (Discrepancy reports are issued by the USCG when an ATON is known to be off station, but the agency has not yet been able to repair the aid. These reports are contained in section 2 of each LNM.) If no discrepancy report has been published, the local USCG district\n93\n\n\fshould be contacted to determine whether the aid was compromised or intentionally relocated to serve its intended purpose. Following USCG confirmation that the aid is correctly positioned or has been properly relocated, the field unit should re-examine the aid. If it remains off station, this ATON should be positioned and reported as if it was an assigned aid.\n\u00b7 Uncharted Fixed ATONs \u00ad This category of ATON is typically comprised of privately maintained aids, and the field unit must determine if such an ATON is navigationally significant. If navigationally significant, a position should be acquired and the ATON reported as if it was assigned. For private aids reported, the field unit should specify both the apparent purpose and by whom the aid is maintained in the report.\n\u00b7 Charted Floating ATONs \u00ad The field unit shall visually verify positions and characteristics of charted floating ATONs during survey operations. If a floating aid is significantly off station with both the scale of the chart and scope of chain considered, the hydrographer should review the LNM for a discrepancy report on the aid. Note: Temporary positions of aids relocated to facilitate dredging, construction, or similar activities are typically not charted. If no discrepancy report has been published, the local USCG district should be contacted to determine if the aid was compromised or intentionally relocated to serve its intended purpose. Following USCG confirmation that the aid is correctly positioned or has been properly relocated, the field unit should re-examine the aid. If it remains off station, acquire a detached position (DP) for the ATON and report this item as if it was an assigned aid. Static GPS observations are not required when positioning floating aids.\n\u00b7 Uncharted Floating ATONs \u00ad The field unit shall determine if each uncharted floating ATON is navigationally significant (e.g., a mooring buoy or full-size private buoy, typically not a small private float). If navigationally significant, the field unit should acquire a DP for the ATON and report this item as if it was an assigned aid. Static GPS observations are not required when positioning floating aids.\nFor each survey, the field unit shall digitally submit an ATON Report to MCD as described in section 5.2.2.3.4 .\n3.5.4 Bottom Samples\nBottom samples are typically obtained and analyzed in accordance with section 2.5.4.2.1 of this manual and section 7.1 of the HSSD, and then discarded. Several sizes of bottom samplers are used in the NOAA hydrographic fleet. and the field unit shall use the most appropriately sized bottom sampler for the vessel and conditions. If the bottom sampler is successfully deployed and tripped three times, yet no sediment sample is acquired, the station shall be labeled \"unknown\" unless additional knowledge is available to the hydrographer. If sediment samples are to be retained for future analysis, guidelines will be provided in the Project Instructions.\n3.5.5 Nearshore Hydrography and Shoreline\nAll modern NOAA hydrographic surveys are Navigable Area Surveys, unless explicitly stated otherwise in the Project Instructions. The navigable area concept is defined in section 1.1.2 of the HSSD. Working near shore is inherently dangerous, and all field units are reminded that safety shall always be the primary consideration when conducting operations. Shoreline verification should not be attempted unless conditions are favorable. Even though an initial assessment is made by the Chief-of-Party, conditions at the actual survey area may be different or degrade as the day progresses. In such cases, the launch or skiff personnel shall not perform shoreline operations until conditions are favorable.\n94\n\n\f3.5.5.1 Source Shoreline Data\n\nUnless otherwise specified in the project instructions, HSD Operations Branch/Navigation Response Branch shall compile and provide a Composite Source File (CSF) and a Project Reference File (PRF) for all projects.\n\nThe composite source is an S-57 attributed dataset in .000 file format, compiled from one or a combination of the following sources: largest scale ENCs, preliminary ENCs, GCs and/or Lidar junction surveys. During planning the project planner reviews the sources listed above to ensure the shoreline files reflect the most recent data coverage for the project area. The following list is a description of how each source is applied to the CSF:\n\n\u00b7 ENCs \u00ad the largest scale ENCs of an area are applied to the CSF. If ENCs of different scales overlap, the larger scale ENC is used to \"clip\" (remove) the smaller scale ENC so there is only one instance of all features at the largest scale for the area.\n\n\u00b7 Preliminary ENCs \u00ad Preliminary ENCs are ENCs which have had source applied (e.g. GC) but the ENC has not been reviewed by MCD and released to the public. Preliminary ENCs are applied to the CSF in the same manner as different scale ENCs. A preliminary ENC may be used to clip the ENC ensuring only one instance of all features.\n\n\u00b7 GCs - GCs that have not been applied to the ENC will be applied to the CSF by clipping the existing ENC shoreline (COALNE) and replacing it with the GC shoreline. All remaining GC features are added to the CSF. There is no further clipping of other features. This may result in duplicate features such as rocks or piles in the CSF which will need to be reconciled by the field unit during verification.\n\n\u00b7 Lidar Surveys \u00ad Lidar junction data is applied to the CSF by adding the approved Lidar features to the CSF. No clipping occurs with the addition of Lidar features which may result in duplicate features which will need to be reconciled by the field unit. (Note, HSD is currently not using shoreline (COALNE) from Lidar surveys)\n\nThe source of each feature is indicated in the SORDAT and SORIND attribute fields.\n\nThe project reference file is an S-57 attributed dataset containing reference layers (i.e. sheets, junctions, recommended bottom sample positions) and features which are specifically targeted for further investigation, such as items from the Automated Wreck and Obstruction Information Service (AWOIS) database, Maritime Boundary, or those surveyed by Lidar but not fully resolved.\n\nReference Features\n\nS-57 Object\n\nDescription\n\nInvestigation Items\n\nCRAINES\n\nAWOIS, Lidar, Maritime Boundary investigation items\n\nAWOIS Radii\n\nACHBRT\n\nAWOIS Search Radius\n\nSurvey Sheets\n\nTESARE\n\nOutline of the survey sheet*\n\nJunction Surveys\n\nTWRTPT\n\nOutline if junction survey\n\nBottom Samples\n\nSPRING\n\nRecommended bottom samples locations\n\nTable 3.7: Features contained in the Project Reference File from Operations Branch\n\n*Note: The inshore limit has been clipped at the 0.8 mm bufer. The buffer will no longer be supplied as a\n\nseperate S-57 object.\n\nFor reference, prior survey features may be provided in S57 format on the project CD/DVD in the prior survey folder.\n\n95\n\n\f3.5.5.2 Types of Shoreline Verification\nHydrographic Survey Project Instructions will specify which shoreline source documents are to be verified as well as the type of verification required, either \"traditional\" or \"limited.\" Shoreline source(s), chart scale(s), and local vessel traffic patterns are among the factors used in determining which method is appropriate for the survey area.\n\n3.5.5.2.1 Traditional Verification\nTraditional shoreline verification is the most thorough and complete method, requiring full examination of all shoreline detail and features seaward of MHW. This technique is very rarely required, and is only necessary if the Project Instructions explicitly call for it. The hydrographer should examine all near shore detail and features seaward of the shoreline (MHW line) originating from composite source documents, NGS-verified remote sensing shoreline data, prior hydrographic surveys, and nautical charts. All features shall be verified, changed, or disproved, provided the operations can be conducted safely. Features located near the shoreline or some accurately plotted reference point may be verified by visual inspection.\n\n3.5.5.2.2 Limited Verification\n\nTypically, a limited verification will be assigned for OCS hydrographic surveys. When conducting limited shoreline verification, the hydrographer shall examine all features seaward of the Navigable Area Limit Line (NALL) as defined in section 1.1.2 of the HSSD. If there is no MHW adjacent to features and the area is not safe to survey, then the area is determined to be foul. Features shall be examined in accordance with the following direction:\n\n\u00b7 All ENC, RNC, Preliminary ENC's, Geographic Cells, and contemporary LIDAR features in the composite source file that are seaward of the NALL should be verified or disproved. If a feature is found within 2 millimeters at the survey scale of the composite source position, a revised field position is not required (This 2mm tolerance does not apply to fixed ATONs specifically assigned for updated positions. See section 3.5.3.3 for additional guidance on these features.). Heights/depths of all features seaward of the NALL should be determined by the best means available given the sea conditions at the time of the survey\n\nChart Interval (milimeters)\n\nSurvey Scale\n\nGround Distance (meters)\n\n2mm\n\n1:5,000\n\n10m\n\n2mm\n\n1:10,000\n\n20m\n\n2mm\n\n1:20,000\n\n40m\n\n2mm\n\n1:40,000\n\n80m\n\n2mm\n\n1:80,000\n\n160m\n\n2mm\n\n1:100,000\n\n200m\n\nTable 3.8: Common survey scale examples of the chart interval 2mm converted to ground distance.\n\n\u00b7 New features seaward of the NALL should be properly positioned.\n\n\u00b7 New point features and new area features where the high point may be used for a navigational landmark also require a corresponding height/depth. Composite source features that are correctly charted do not require corresponding height/depth verification.\n\n96\n\n\f\u00b7 Features with any horizontal dimension greater than 1.0mm at survey scale should be treated as area features and delineated appropriately. Features with lesser horizontal dimensions should be positioned and attributed as point features.\n\u00b7 The hydrographer shall address blatant and obvious shoreline discrepancies between hydrography and deconflicted features in the Composite Source File.\n\u00b7 Prior survey features are for reference only. There is no requirement for the hydrographer to address prior survey features in the Descriptive Report.\nIt may be necessary to position, verify, or disprove some features inshore of the NALL, if they are both navigationally significant and safe to approach. Examples of features which might meet this standard include:\n\u00b7 Aids to Navigation\n\u00b7 Natural or man-made features sufficiently conspicuous to be an obvious navigational landmark (e.g., piers, pilings, or very large and isolated boulders or outcroppings)\nNote: \"Navigationally significant\" is not easily and absolutely defined. As such, it makes up part of the \"art\" of hydrography versus the more easily quantifiable \"science\" aspect of the profession. Navigational significance depends on location, proximity to shore and/or other features and the marine traffic patterns/usage in the area. Ideally the person making the determination of navigational significance will be one who has extensive experience utilizing NOAA/NOS charts for navigation and can convey that perspective to the persons conducting the field survey work. This is typically the NOAA vessel Commanding Officer (Chief-of-Party) or Field Operations Officer, Hydrographer-in-Charge, or the contractor's Lead Hydrographer.\n3.5.5.3 Conducting Shoreline Verification\nShoreline verification operations should be scheduled for daylight periods when the tide is less than 0.5m above Mean Lower-low Water (chart datum). To maximize the shoreline \"window\", it is usually advantageous to plan for shoreline operations during spring tides when the extreme range allows for longer low water periods each day. In some cases, ideal water level conditions may not be available while the field unit is in the project area. In these cases, the Chief-of-Party should request further instructions from the Chief, HSD Operations Branch. Shoreline verification should be performed prior to main scheme bathymetric data acquisition in nearshore areas to ensure that submerged hazards have been identified to the fullest extent possible before launches with protruding transducers operate in the area.\nShoreline verification is typically conducted from a small, maneuverable survey vessel such as a skiff or jet-drive survey launch. The vessel should be equipped with survey-grade GPS and vertical beam or tilted multibeam echosounder interfaced to an appropriate data acquisition computer and software. Multibeam echosounders which are mounted perpendicular to the seafloor (i.e. not tilted) are not ideal for shoreline verification because of the increased risk of damage to hull-mounted transducers when operating in unsurveyed nearshore areas.\nThe vessel's data acquisition software should be loaded with the composite source and other applicable files (ENC, RNC, and Project Reference File). In addition, it is often helpful to print a large \"boat sheet\" of the composite source on a large format printer. This is useful for orientation and quickly recording field observations.\n97\n\n\fA common and effective method for conducting shoreline verification is to run a VBES survey line parallel to shore, observing exposed features. In the case of Limited Shoreline Verification, this survey line should approximate the NALL, allowing the hydrographers to focus most of their attention offshore of the vessel. This approximate NALL can be used later to assist in planning the inshore extent of bathymetry. As features meeting the criteria given in section 3.5.5.2 are encountered, the survey vessel should break off from following the NALL, investigate the features as required, and return to following the NALL.\nNote that not all features require or even warrant investigation at low water. To maximize efficient use of low water windows, it may be best to skip these features on the initial pass, and return at a higher stage of tide. In extreme cases, it may be possible and advantageous to acquire complete MBES coverage of features which are exposed at low water.\n3.5.5.4 Recording Shoreline Data\nPoint features are generally positioned using Detached Positions with a range and bearing from the survey launch, or by direct occupation with a portable GPS system. Line features or the extents of areas can be bounded by recording data as the launch passes as close as possible to the feature, taking DPs at the extents of the feature, or using a roving portable GPS to walk the extents ashore. In all cases, it may be prudent to take written notes on log sheets and/or the boat sheet in addition to recording data digitally.\nAccuracy requirements for point positions depend on the type of feature being located. If the feature is a wharf or pier potentially to be used for zero-visibility docking, the horizontal position error should be 1.0 meter or less. For features not critical to zero-visibility navigation or docking, accuracy for all points should meet the minimum horizontal position accuracy requirement set forth in the HSSD. The method of positioning a feature to the required accuracy is typically left to the discretion of the hydrographer, subject to the guidance in section 3.5.3 .\nWhen recording line data, positions are logged at regular intervals small enough to facilitate a \"connect the dots\" drawing of the area. Line data is a valuable tool for accurately delineating curved or irregular features. OCS recommends that line data used to define such features be acquired with a data collection interval of one second.\nAll data should be acquired with S-57 and NOAA attribution collected at the times of acquisition. While many S-57 object types and attributes are self-explanatory, the hydrographer should consult the S-57 catalog for further guidance.\n3.5.6 Maritime Boundary Delineation\n3.5.6.1 Background\nOCS is responsible for depicting the Three Nautical Mile Line (old territorial sea), Territorial Sea at 12 nautical miles, Contiguous Zone at 24 nautical miles, and Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) at 200 nautical miles on NOAA nautical charts. These maritime zones, whose limits are measured using principles set forth in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), define areas of U.S. jurisdiction for a variety of regulations. Noteworthy examples that highlight the importance of near-shore surveys include provisions of the Clean Water Act and Oil Pollution Act, which are tied to the inner and outer extents of the old territorial sea at 3 nautical miles. In addition, the Three Nautical Mile Line is often used by state and federal enforcement officials to police fisheries and other laws.\n98\n\n\fFigure 3.7 highlights the breadth of offshore maritime and marine boundaries. Among a host of marine boundaries, the U.S. maritime zones (in red) include the territorial sea (0-12nm), contiguous zone (12-24nm), and EEZ (12200nm). The U.S. also retains and charts a territorial sea at 3nm, which supports enforcement of the Clean Water and Oil Pollution Acts. All of these zones are measured from the U.S. baseline, which is largely composed of the charted low water line (at MLLW) as well as closing lines across legally-defined bays and rivers. Various federal, state, and local governments reference the limits on NOAA nautical charts as well as best practices for defining those limits to enforce their own regulations.\nFigure 3.7: Breadth of Offshore Maritime and Marine Boundaries\nFigure 3.8: Normal baseline with projected envelope of arcs (from \"Shore and Sea Boundaries byShalowitz)\nIn accordance with customary international law and UNCLOS, the U.S. maritime zones are measured from what is referred to as the \"normal baseline.\" Simply stated the normal baseline is composed of features that are dry at mean lower low water (MLLW). This includes naturally-formed offshore rocks awash and harbor structures, such as groins, jetties, and breakwaters (not recreational fishing piers). The maritime zones are measured from the baseline using a method called \"envelope of arcs\" (see Figure 3.8). Using this method, only the most seaward features influence the outer limits of the U.S. maritime zones.\n99\n\n\fArcs generated from these salient baseline points are blended together to form continuous limit lines at 3, 12, 24, or 200 nautical miles. Finally, the U.S. baseline as well as the maritime zones are reviewed and approved by an inter-agency federal group called the U.S. Baseline Committee, which was established in 1970 and is chaired by the Department of State.\nFigure 3.9: Near-shore Feature Impacts to Offshore Limits Figure 3.9 highlights how near-shore features can impact the offshore limits. Occasionally and depending upon segment length and orientation, closing lines across legally-defined bays and rivers (another component of the U.S. baseline) will influence the outer limits of the U.S. maritime zones. The territorial sea is measured from a normal baseline, which generally consists of the mainland low-water line and offshore islands (A), plus any closing lines across the mouths of rivers or legal bays (B), the outermost points of permanent harbor works (C), and low-tide elevations wholly situated at a distance not exceeding the breadth of the territorial sea from the mainland (D). Contributing baseline points, which are used to generate the maritime limits, are denoted as red Xs. Determining the exact nature of charted low-water features is not always straightforward, and to aid enforcement of the U.S. maritime zones, U.S. policy is to refrain from using uncertain features in the baseline. The most controversial feature is the charted rock awash because many times compilation of older surveys to the nautical chart did not include height information. In addition, the rock awash symbol is compiled through different standards with east coast (includes Gulf of Mexico), west coast and Great Lakes surveys. The standards for compiling rocks and islets to the nautical chart can be found in the HSSD Appendix 8: Rock Attribution and in excerpts from MCD's Nautical Chart Manual sections 4.9.1 and 4.9.2.\n3.5.6.2 Procedures The maritime boundary verification requests are compiled by HSD OPS and delivered to the field units in the Project Instructions. The point features are included in the Project Reference File (PRF) as the S-57 Object CRANES and are distinguished by the NOAA Extended Attribute \"Special Feature Type\" (sftype) populated with MARITIME BOUNDARY. The hydrographer is responsible for verifying the existence of the furthest offshore fea- ture that is dry at MLLW recognizing that the furthest offshore feature may not be the feature within close proximity to the Maritime Boundary investigation point.\n100\n\n\fSee sections 7.3 Investigation Items and 8.2 S-57 Soundings and Feature Deliverables of the HSSD for further information on Maritime Boundary point requirements and attribution. Note, if MBES was used for verification the hydrographer should not delineate the linear MLLW on the field deliverable as this is performed by cartographers at the branches. 3.5.6.2.1 Processing & Deliverables Maritime boundary features are flagged in the processing software as Maritime Boundary features. The field notes are updated in the Remarks attribute and digital photographs are labeled and correlated to the Maritime Boundary item. If MBES was used for verification the hydrographer should not delineate the linear MLLW on the field deliverable as this is performed by cartographers at the branches. Point features covered by MBES should follow the standard procedures as described above. 3.5.7 Coast Pilot Data A Coast Pilot Review shall be conducted for each assigned survey area. The review consists of downloading the appropriate Coast Pilot section for verification and updates. In addition, reviewing the information relating to general operations in the area such as frequent transited areas and facilities utilized. See section 7.4 of the HSSD for further information on requirements and the sections below for procedures.\n101\n\n\f3.5.7.1 Performing a Coast Pilot Review\nWhen determining what information is pertinent for the Coast Pilot, the size, type, and number of vessels using each waterway must be taken into account. The requirements of the deep-draft navigator, yachtsman, and fisherman must all be kept in mind. Allowance must also be made for the thoroughness with which the region has been surveyed and charted. If the surveys of the area are incomplete, if the harbor charts are on too small a scale, or if the harbor has grown in importance, more detail will be required in the Coast Pilot. If possible, digital photographs should be submitted for significant Coast Pilot features in accordance with section 3.5.7.2.\nIf additional information is necessary to address a Coast Pilot item, a wide variety of locally knowledgeable people can be used. However, information from outside sources should be verified by the reviewer. The source of the report should be given so that the report's value may be weighed against conflicting information that may be received by NOAA's Marine Chart Division. The following is a list of the principal organizations and officials who can be interviewed for the purpose of obtaining local information: Coast Guard stations and other aids to navigation units, buoy tenders and other cutters, patrol craft, and Marine Safety Offices\n\u00b7 Corps of Engineers district offices or other Federal field offices such as Customs Service\n\u00b7 Pilot associations, port authorities, harbormasters, and harbor police\n\u00b7 Other NOAA field parties operating in the area\n\u00b7 Operators of repair yards and marine service stations\n\u00b7 Captains of towboats, ferries, and coastwise vessels operating in the area\n\u00b7 Individuals very familiar with the area such as fishermen and longtime residents\n\u00b7 Yacht clubs\nThe following sections describe categories of information that should be addressed during a Coast Pilot Review. The majority of this information is best obtained during field operations and is thus considered a part of data acquisition.\n3.5.7.1.1 Aids to Navigation\nEvery effort should be made to ensure that aids to navigation referenced in the Coast Pilot are correctly identified and in agreement with both the chart and the Light List. Information regarding significant new aids to navigation (e.g., buoys/lights marking specific dangers to navigation) should be added.\n3.5.7.1.2 Anchorages\nAttempt to obtain information on both charted and uncharted anchorage areas. The adequacy and accuracy of anchorage information in the Coast Pilot should be checked, and new reliable information should be added when possible. Anchorage information is one of the most difficult types of information to obtain and check, since it must come from actual anchoring experience. Good judgment must be exercised by field personnel in obtaining such information. A particular location is not a good anchorage simply because someone has anchored there.\n102\n\n\f3.5.7.1.3 Bridges\nNote bridges that are in the process of renovation (to the extent that type of bridge, vertical clearance, horizontal clearance, or other description normally mentioned in the Coast Pilot is affected), bridges that have been newly constructed, and/or bridges that have been removed in whole or in part. Confirm proper names of bridges as included in the Coast Pilot or shown on the charts. Obtain new names as appropriate. Confirm or obtain VHF radio frequencies/channels monitored, hailing protocols used by local traffic and telephone contacts related to bridge operations, if applicable.\n3.5.7.1.4 Channels\nText referring to privately maintained channels and basins, natural channels, and federally maintained channels within the assigned survey area should be reviewed and updated as necessary.\n3.5.7.1.5 Dangers to Navigation\nReview and update as necessary any Coast Pilot text addressing charted rocks, shoals, reefs, wrecks, piles, snags, and other objects dangerous to navigation within the survey area.\n3.5.7.1.6 Depths and Sounding Data\nOnce present survey soundings have been processed and compared to charted depths, any Coast Pilot text referencing specific depths within the survey area should be reviewed and updated as necessary. Note: The hydrographer should be certain that final water level correctors have been applied to sounding data prior to reporting specific depths in the Coast Pilot Review.\nIf new depth information is received for an area outside of the assigned survey, but can not be verified by approved NOAA hydrographic survey methods, this information can be included in the Coast Pilot as \"reported.\" Reported information should be avoided unless deemed critical for safe navigation. If reported information is used, it must be qualified as such, giving the date and the source of information. Reported depths are published in the Coast Pilot as shown in the following example: \"In June 2004, the channel had a reported controlling depth of 3 feet.\"\n3.5.7.1.7 Ferries, Cable Ferries, and Pontoon Bridges\nReport the locations of new ferry terminals and routes and/or the abandonment of old ones. If applicable, include information about VHF radio frequencies monitored, hailing protocol, and telephone contacts. Cable ferries and pontoon bridges pose a potential hazard to mariners. Obtain detailed information on their operations. Information regarding operational peculiarities of any other movable bridges encountered should be included.\n3.5.7.1.8 Landmarks\nLandmarks shall be inspected from seaward insofar as practicable. New landmarks considered to be significant for vessel navigation should be positioned with DGPS, if possible. Describe each landmark, including position, height, color and any other distinctive features that will aid in identification. Give the shape of objects that may not be generally recognized by the name alone, such as \"the large white dish of the charted radiotelescope.\"\n103\n\n\f3.5.7.1.9 Locks, Canals, and Hurricane Gates\nOperational peculiarities of locks, canals, hurricane gates, and other navigation projects should be noted. Include information about traffic signals, VHF radio frequencies/ channels monitored, hailing protocol, and telephone contacts, if applicable.\n3.5.7.1.10 Overhead Cables\nMake note of overhead cables that are not charted and/or not mentioned in the Coast Pilot. Attempt to ascertain the following about the owner of the new cable: name of the company, address, telephone number, and name of a cognizant individual in the company. This information is necessary in order to obtain copies of the cable permits from the local District Engineer staff of the Corps of Engineers.\n3.5.7.1.11 Major Deep Draft Ports\nCoast Pilot information pertaining to major ports, shipping terminals, and wharves within the survey area should be reviewed and confirmed to whatever extent practicable via sounding data and reconnaissance during survey operations. Particular attention should be paid to depth information stated in the text.\nIf at all possible, the local pilot association should be contacted. Pilotage information is one of the most important items in the Coast Pilot. Pilots should be requested to read the pilotage section in the Coast Pilot and point out any errors and/or new information that should be added. Be sure to address where vessels are boarded or anchored for quarantine, and whether inspections are made by any U.S. Government agency.\nAdditional information, such as low altitude oblique photographs, may be obtained from a variety of sources such as the local port authority, harbormaster, harbor police, and customs, immigration, public health, and agriculture officials at the port. Information on repair facilities can be obtained from shipyards and boatyards. Local towboat companies are often a good source of information, not only regarding the size and type of tugs available, but also for other information such as local peculiarities of winds and currents, the routes followed by tugs and barges, etc.\n3.5.7.1.12 Small Deep Draft Ports\nCoast Pilot information pertaining to smaller deep-draft ports, shipping terminals, and wharves within the survey area should be reviewed and confirmed to whatever extent practicable via sounding data and reconnaissance during survey operations. Particular attention should be paid to depth information stated in the text. Although small deep-draft ports do not typically have large port authority staffs, additional information may be available from the port's general manager.\n3.5.7.1.13 Small Craft Harbors\nCoast Pilot information pertaining to small craft harbors within the survey area should be reviewed and confirmed to whatever extent practicable via sounding data and reconnaissance during survey operations. Additional information may be available by contacting either the harbormaster or harbor patrol personnel, as well as operators of towboats, boatyards, marinas, and state and federal agencies. Local yachtsmen and fishermen can be consulted when appropriate.\n104\n\n\f3.5.7.1.14 Radar and Radio Information\nIf possible, obtain information on the best radar targets and the approximate maximum range at which they can be positively identified and used. The VHF radio frequencies/ channels used in port areas for different types of communications between various private and public concerns should be ascertained. Where a radio watch is maintained by pilots, harbormasters, bridge tenders, lockmasters, and other parties significant to the mariner, confirm guarding schedules, VHF radio frequencies, hailing protocol, and telephone contacts, if applicable.\n3.5.7.1.15 Shoreline Changes\nCoast Pilot information pertaining to shoreline within the survey area should be reviewed and confirmed to whatever extent practicable via sounding data and reconnaissance during survey operations. Note condition, additions, and deletions of wharves, piers, and other waterfront structures. If a pier or other shoreline structure has been removed, note whether piles or ruins remain as a navigational hazard. Assume the existence of submerged ruins unless there is contrary evidence. Also report significant shoreline changes, whether caused by dredging and/or filling or by natural events.\nIf Coast Pilot information pertaining to shoreline outside of the survey area (e.g., areas frequently transited or facilities utilized during inports) can be verified or updated during survey operations, this information should be addressed in the Coast Pilot Review.\n3.5.7.1.16 Wrecks\nIf numerous wrecks are found to exist in a specific location, an attempt should be made to ascertain the causes from survey data and/or local sources. If a specific hazard is determined, suitable highlighting of the situation should be verified or added in the Coast Pilot.\nIn addition to the above categories of information, any anomalous conditions that may affect safe navigation should be addressed.\n3.5.7.2 Digital Photographs\nWhen possible, digital photographs portraying significant Coast Pilot features should be acquired. Sea level photos should be taken from seaward, from as high a vantage point as possible and close enough so that principal landmarks can be identified. Photos taken successively from 2 miles out or less, typically upon entering or departing a harbor, may be useful in identifying the harbor approach or specific landmarks. If a single photo will not adequately cover the view of a harbor with sufficient detail, a panoramic series of photos can be submitted.\nDigital photos submitted to the Coast Pilot Branch may be included in subsequent editions of the publication. To ensure photographs are of sufficient quality for publication, the following criteria should be met:\n\u00b7 The camera should have a resolution capability of 4 megapixels or better.\n\u00b7 A digital zoom feature should not be used. A camera with minimum optical zoom capability from wide angle (35mm) to a mild zoom (out to 105mm) is recommended. (Ideally, the camera would accept lenses of different focal lengths, such as wide angle, normal, and zoom.) \u00b7 Photographs should be taken using an ISO setting of 100 (preferred) or less, but in no case higher than 200.\n105\n\n\f\u00b7 Shutter speed should be set to at least 1/100th of a second. \u00b7 The photograph should be taken using a pixel setting of approximately 2300 x 1700 or better. \u00b7 JPEG (*.jpg) format is required for submission. Use of any other format should be cleared by the Coast Pilot\nBranch. Select \"JPEG (EXIF)\" if that choice is given. EXIF is a standard metadata format that embeds information about the camera and its settings such as focal length, shutter speed, lighting condition, and other valuable information about the photograph into the file.\n3.5.8 Electronic Navigational Chart (ENC) Verification Verifications of ENC data are primarily performed by the NRTs. If ENC verification is required in conjunction with a standard NOAA hydrographic survey, it will be stated in the Project Instructions. Information regarding ENC shoreline and offshore features is given below.\n3.5.8.1 ENC Shoreline Features\n3.5.8.1.1 Aids to Navigation\nUnless specifically assigned, aids to navigation to be located are left to the discretion of the hydrographer. Range lights, channel lights, and major pier lights are priorities and should be positioned using static GPS whenever possible, unless an acceptable (Third-order, Class I or higher) published position is available. Other federally maintained aids such as day beacons and buoys, as well as privately maintained aids may be located using hydrographic positioning methods. Refer to section 7.2 of the HSSD for further guidance.\n3.5.8.1.2 Structures\nOn features directly affecting vessel docking, obtain one-meter accuracy DGPS positions on all critical points. Other points on the same feature may be surveyed to five-meter accuracy and/or derived from the imagery/ shoreline files, provided they are accurate to five meters or less. All other structures may be surveyed to five-meter accuracy. Enter all relevant information; i.e., name, status, condition, etc., in the \"Remarks\" column.\n3.5.8.1.3 Works in Progress\nDetermine the status of construction for the identified marine facility or other chartable shoreline construction. Obtain as-built plan drawings if possible. When as-built drawings are obtained, ensure that they have a coordinate system on them. If they don't, the NRT should obtain reference positions for the drawings using a GIS data collection and data maintenance system. Use the \"Remarks\" column to report the name, status, condition, or other relevant information.\n106\n\n\f3.5.8.1.4 ENC Offshore Features 3.5.8.1.4.1 Bridges The appropriate NSD Navigation Manager will attempt to get as-built drawings for project area bridges before the NRT arrives. If as-built drawings have been supplied, then the NRT will position the ends or other identifiable points of the bridge to provide geo-reference points for the drawing. When no drawings are supplied and no DGPS interference is experienced, one-meter accuracy DGPS positions are required, to delineate clearances between bridge pier fenders facing commercial vessel traffic. Bridge pier fender points not facing commercial vessel traffic may be surveyed to five-meter accuracy depending on the relative importance to be determined by the hydrographer. When acquiring data points around obstructions such as bridges, differential correctors from the USCG beacons should be used. The Trimble Pathfinder Pro XRS has multi-path rejection technology that works best when using USCG correctors. Use the \"Remarks\" column in MapInfo Final Field Sheet table to report the name, status, condition, or other relevant information. When a drawing is not available and DGPS interference is experienced, then the NRT will attempt to obtain positions over the supports that separate the commercial channel. NRB will not acquire positions on bridge fenders where the bridge structure causes DGPS interference.\n3.5.8.1.4.2 Channel Depths Where applicable, inquire with facility owners/managers about the status of privately maintained channels to update charted notations. Provide documentation in the Descriptive Report or Chart Letter and submit diagrams or survey copies when possible. In some cases (at the discretion of the Team Leader) a survey of the channel will be required to obtain the current operating depths.\n107\n\n\fChapter 4\nData Processing and Analysis\nTe purpose of this chapter is to provide the information necessary to clean, fnalize, and analyze data for OCS hydrographic surveys. Te following types of data are addressed separately in this chapter.\n\u00b7 Bathymetry (VBES and MBES data)\n\u00b7 Imagery (SSS data)\n\u00b7 Features (bathymetry and imagery contacts, detached positions, AWOIS items, geographic positions)\nRelevant steps regarding the post-processing of inertially-aided GPS data are mentioned in this section but full details are discussed in the Ellipsoidally Referenced Survey SOP.pdf in Appendix 4. For additional guidelines consult the HSSD Chapter 9 Ellipsoidally-Referenced Surveys.\n4.1 Preparation for Data Processing\nData processing for OCS hydrographic survey data is typically performed using CARIS HIPS and SIPS sofware. HIPS tools are used to process bathymetry data, and SIPS tools are used with imagery data. To begin processing data in CARIS HIPS and SIPS, a \"Project\" must be created. A CARIS Project consists of a data fling system, structured according to a tree of project/vessel/day/line (PVDL) folders, where \"vessel\" refers to a particular vessel confguration fle, known as a HIPS Vessel File (HVF).\nTe HVF establishes, in HIPS and SIPS, the relationship between survey sensors as logged by the acquisition sofware. Te HVF must refect any corrections or compensation of logged sensor data performed during acquisition. Some sonar systems require, or perform in a superior fashion, if real-time corrections (e.g., refraction) are used. Any real-time corrections included in the logged data must be accounted for when creating the HVF. Te HVF also includes information essential for estimating sounding measurement errors (see section 4.2.3.8). Depth and position errors will be introduced if data are processed using an incorrect HVF.\nProper setup of HVFs is critical for accurate survey data, and this process is usually completed under the direction of senior survey personnel. Tese fles are typically created at the beginning of a feld season, but they will need to be amended if confgurations change. Guidelines for creating an HVF are described in section 4.1.1. Refer to the CARIS HIPS and SIPS User's Manual, found on the Hydrosof website, for addition information.\nOnce HVF fles have been created, the HIPS and SIPS New Project Wizard can be used to specify a Project name, associated vessels, and days for which data was acquired. Te \"day\" name is formatted as YYYY-DOY (year + day of year). Day of year (DOY) refers to a sequential number starting with 001 on January 1 of each year and ending with 365, or 366 in leap years, on December 31 of that year.\n108\n\n\fNote: DOY is not synonymous with Julian Day Number and should not be referred to as such. Te Julian Day numbering system refers to the number of days since noon on January 1, 4713 BC, a system widely used by astronomers.\n4.1.1 Creating HIPS Vessel Files (HVFs) A new HVF is created using the HIPS and SIPS Vessel Wizard, part of the Vessel Editor tool. As the user works through the Vessel Wizard, HVF options must be chosen based on survey systems and confguration. Once the initial HVF is created, additional parameters such as ofsets and error corrections must be entered for each individual sensor.\n4.1.1.1 HIPS and SIPS Vessel Wizard Te Vessel Wizard will frst prompt the user to enter a name for a new HVF fle. HVF naming conventions have been standardized throughout the NOAA hydrographic feet. Te following naming convention shall be used for NOAA hydrographic vessel HVF fles: <ship/feld unit abbreviation>_<vessel hull number>_<data type + category>.hvf Table 4.1 contains a list of common data types acquired during OCS hydrographic surveys and example HVF names for each. Note that the feld season year is not included in the name; rather, timestamp entries within the HVF are used to track application dates. Only a reference to the principal echosounder or side scan sonar type should be included in the last portion of the HVF name. More detailed equipment specifcations and information are recorded within the HVF. For HVFs associated with MBES and SSS data, include the sensor model; for vertical beam echosounder data, use the sufx \"VB.\" Once an HVF name is entered, the user will be asked to enter specifcations for the applicable sonar system, such as sonar type, number of transducers, number of beams, etc. Te information requested is typically either based on the physical system confguration or can be located in the sonar user's manual.\n109\n\n\fData Type Multibeam Echosounder\nMain-scheme Survey Lines or Investigation Lines\n\nHVF Name Examples\n\"FA_2806_Reson7125\" - NOAA Ship FAIRWEATHER launch 1010, Reson 7125 multibeam\n\nVertical Beam Echosounder\nMain-scheme Survey Lines or Investigation Lines\nTowed Side Scan Sonar - 100% and 200% Coverage\nOther Coverage (e.g., additional investigations, bufer lines)\nHull-mounted Side Scan Sonar 100% and 200% Coverage\nOther Coverage Echosounder Point Observations\nDepth \"Detached Positions\" (DPs)\nNon-Echosounder Point Observations\n\n\"BH_S5501_Reson7125\" - BAY HYDROGRAPHER, Reson 7125 multibeam \"RA_S221_VB\" - NOAA Ship RAINIER, vertical beam\n\"NRT2_1210_VB\" - Navigational Response Team 2, boat 1210 vertical beam \"TJ_S222_Klein5000\" - NOAA Ship THOMAS JEFFERSON, Klein 5000 100-percent side scan sonar\n\"NRT2_1210_Klein3000HF\" - Navigation Response Team 2, boat 1210, Klein 3000 high frequency 100-percent side scan sonar \"TJ_3101_Klein5000Hull\" - NOAA Ship THOMAS JEFFERSON, launch 3101, hull-mounted Klein 5000, non-100/200 coverage\n\"NRT2_1210_EchosounderDP\" - Navigation Response Team 2, boat 1210, echosounder DPs\n\"RA_2801_EchosounderDP\" - NOAA Ship RAINIER, launch 2801, echosounder DPs \"RA_2801_ShorelineDP\" - NOAA Ship RAINIER, launch 2801, Shoreline DPs\n\nDiver Least Depth DPs\n\n\"TJ_3101_DiverDP\" - NOAA Ship THOMAS\n\nJEFFERSON, launch 3101, Diver DPs\n\nShoreline DPs\n\nTable 4.1: Example HVF naming conventions for NOAA hydrographic vessels.\n\n4.1.1.1.1 Motion Sensor Options\nHIPS and SIPS Vessel Wizard will prompt the user to enter what vessel motion data (i.e., attitude data) will be recorded and whether these data should be applied during post-processing. Te meaning of \"apply in postprocessing\" for heave is straightforward. If survey data were not logged with heave corrections applied during data acquisition, and heave data (either real-time values or true heave, as discussed in section 3.4.1.2 were recorded separately, then apply this correction in post-processing. Te standard practice for OCS hydrography is to not correct survey data for heave during data acquisition; hence, \"apply in post-processing\" is usually enabled for this sensor in the HVF.\nTe application of roll and pitch is a bit more complicated than applying heave. Te user must keep in mind that options to apply roll and pitch will afect any remote heave calculations. (Remote heave is defned as changes in\n110\n\n\fvertical position of the transducer due to roll and pitch acting over a non-zero moment arm between the heave sensor and the transducer). If remote heave compensation is to be performed in HIPS, the vessel coordinate system reference point (RP) entered in the HVF will be treated as the center of rotation and, therefore, should be established as close to the vessel's center of motion as possible.\nMany MBES sensors can be confgured to acquire bathymetry using roll or pitch beam steering. In these cases, the HVF apply roll & pitch options should be set according to the data acquisition confguration. If roll steering was enabled during acquisition, do not apply roll in post- processing. If roll steering was not enabled, the HVF option to apply roll in post-processing should be checked. Likewise, if pitch steering was enabled during acquisition, do not apply pitch in post-processing. If pitch steering was not used, the HVF option to apply pitch in post-processing should be checked.\n4.1.1.1.2 Confguration Options\nTe Vessel Wizard confguration options enable the user to enter ofset parameters for \"sound velocity\" corrections (more appropriately, sound speed corrections as explained in section 4.2.3.6 , a dynamic draf table, and \"waterline\" value for the vessel. Typically, bathymetry data will require sound speed (i.e., refraction) correction during postprocessing and the option to \"defne parameters for sound velocity corrections\" should be checked. If this option is checked, the hydrographer will also be prompted to enter any mounting ofsets for the sonar transducer. Only large mounting ofsets should be entered here. Small ofsets will be accounted for during the patch test. However, some MBES systems correct for refraction during data acquisition. If refraction correction has been performed in real-time during data acquisition, it can be performed again during post processing with more fexibility in how the sound speed correctors are applied to the data. Typically imagery data will not require sound speed correction either, and \"defning parameters for sound velocity corrections\" is unnecessary for HVFs used only to process data that will not be sound speed corrected during post-processing.\nDynamic draf refers to changes in draf induced by the fow efects of a vessel moving through the water. Corrections for this efect can be applied during post-processing via either a Dynamic Draf table of speed-versus-draf values entered in the HVF or from a \"delta draf\" time series that is loaded during post-processing. Te OCS standard practice is to enter a speed-versus-draf table that is applied in post-processing. Tus, in most cases the option to \"create a Dynamic Draf table or speed vs. draf values\" should be checked and values manually entered into this table by the hydrographer.\nTe term \"waterline height\", as defned by CARIS, refers to the measured vertical diference between the vessel waterline and the established origin of the local vessel reference frame (RP). Tis value will be positive if the vessel waterline is below the RP, and negative if the vessel waterline is above the RP. Variations in static draf of the transducer should be accounted for by adjusting the waterline height in the HVF, thus the HVF option to \"defne vessel waterline height variations\" should be checked and the waterline value applied in post-processing.\nNote: Some sonar systems must be confgured such that depths are reported relative to the waterline, rather than the transducer. In such cases, the value entered for waterline may not be as defned above, and the hydrographer should verify that the combination of values entered in the HVF for transducer vertical ofset and waterline do not cause an erroneous vertical correction.\n4.1.1.2 HIPS and SIPS Vessel Editor\nOnce a new HVF has been created with the Vessel Wizard, sensor ofsets and additional sensors, such as CARIS \"TPU values,\" can be activated using the CARIS HIPS and SIPS Vessel Editor. It should be noted that HVFs use a\n111\n\n\flef-handed coordinate system, as summarized in Table 4.2. (Be aware that despite the fact that the +Z axis is down, when recording vessel motion positive heave action is up.) Te user should verify that ofset values determined during the vessel survey adhere to the same coordinate system as the HVF. If this is not the case, surveyed ofset values will need to be converted so that the vessel confguration is accurately represented in the HVF.\n\nCoordinate System Component\n\nDirection\n\n+X axis\n\nStarboard\n\n+Y axis\n\nForward (toward bow)\n\n+ Z axis\n\nDown (into the water)\n\n+Pitch\n\nBow down\n\n+Roll\n\nStarboard up\n\n+Heave\n\nUp (out of the water)\n\nTable 4.2: CARIS HVF coordinate system (a lef handed coordinate system).\n\nNote: Coordinate systems vary among NOAA survey systems and sofware. Tis information should be verifed in the appropriate user's manual prior to entering ofsets into any sofware or equipment confguration. Coordinate systems for common OCS survey systems are described in Appendix 1, (Coordinate_Systems.pdf).\n\nTe hydrographer may fnd it useful to create a three-dimensional Vessel Shape when entering sensor ofsets.\n\nTis image, created using Vessel Editor's Edit > Vessel Shape menu, shows the relative location of sensors as entered in the HVF and can provide the hydrographer with a quick verifcation that ofsets have been entered correctly.\n\nTe feld unit shall ensure that the vessel ofsets, entered in the HVF are fully consistent with those, listed in the DAPR (see section 8.1.5.1 of HSSD). Any inconsistencies shall be addressed in the DR (see section 8.1.4 of HSSD).\n\n4.1.2 Creating CARIS Projects\nCARIS Projects shall be created for each survey and include only the survey registry number (e.g. H12345, or F00123). New Projects are created using the CARIS New Project Wizard. When adding a new project, the wizard will request the following data:\n\u00b7 Description \u00ad Provide a brief summary of the purpose of the Project and any signifcant survey-specifc information. Te bulk of the description can be extracted from the Introduction, Location, and Priority sections of the Project Instructions. Note: Entering a description is important because this is one of the few places in HIPS and SIPS where external metadata can be attached to digital data.\n\u00b7 Owner \u00ad List the assigned ship or feld party, as well as the Lead Hydrographer (Commanding Ofcer or Chief-of-Party) and Survey Manager.\n\u00b7 Map Projection \u00ad Map Projection establishes the coordinate system to be used for the Project view in HIPS/ SIPS. If AUTO_UTM is specifed, the coordinate system of the Project view will be based on the ellipsoid manually entered in the HVF. Te AUTO_UTM option can be used, provided a Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection on the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83) has been entered for all HVF fles associated with the survey.\n\u00b7 Project Extent \u00ad Enter the basic boundaries of the survey area. Project Extent is expressed as a regular (i.e., non-rotated) rectangle. Project Extent should completely cover the assigned survey limits. Note that data 112\n\n\fbrought into a CARIS Project are not automatically clipped to this area; the clipping function is optional and requires user activation. If activated, the default clipping boundary will be the Project Extent, but this may be modifed by the user. Refer to the CARIS HIPS and SIPS User's Manual for additional information on clipping data.\n4.2 Bathymetry Processing\nNOAA hydrographic feld units typically acquire bathymetric data using VBES, MBES, or a combination of both. VBES depths are processed using the CARIS HIPS Single Beam Editor tool to review and edit data anomalies. MBES data may be edited in two diferent ways: using CARIS HIPS Swath Editor tool to edit data in a time-series mode, or using the CARIS HIPS Subset Editor tool to edit data in a spatial mode. In both instances, Bathymetry Associated with Statistical Error (BASE) methods are used to generate, using one or more diferent algorithms, a digital seafoor model that contains depth and uncertainty information at each model node. In addition to the basic bathymetric layer, auxiliary information layers such as standard deviation of soundings, sounding density, shoal depth, source identifcation, hypothesis count, and hypothesis strength will be generated depending upon the algorithm used to construct the BASE surface. Tese BASE surface layers are used to guide the hydrographer to areas that require further examination and/or editing. Tis concept is explained in greater detail in section 4.2.1 .\nUnlike VBES and MBES data, depth measurements acquired by leadline, sounding pole and/or diver least depth gauge are positioned using a type of target fle referred to as a detached position (DP) and depth data is entered manually in CARIS Notebook or Pydro. Since target fles are more frequently used to locate point features such as shoreline items and bottom samples than these types of depth measurements, processing details have been included in section 4.4.1.2 .\n4.2.1 Te BASE Surface Concept\nA BASE surface represents bathymetry as a dense grid of statistically derived depth estimates. Various products can be derived from BASE surfaces, including a shoal-biased set of depth estimates for safe vessel navigation. Te BASE surface paradigm discussed herein is specifcally designed for MBES data, which typically has a high sounding density. Nevertheless, VBES data can also be assimilated into the BASE surface model. Te Survey Manager should consult, through his/her chain-of-command, OCS's Hydrographic Surveys Division for the most current guidance on incorporating VBES data into BASE surface data.\n4.2.1.1 Base Surface Methods\nTere are two diferent algorithms used by NOAA hydrographic feld units for creating BASE surfaces: uncertainty weighted grids and the Combined Uncertainty and Bathymetric Estimator (CUBE) method and uncertainty weighted grids. Te preferred method shall be the CUBE method, but uncertainty weighted grids will be allowed. Teir use shall be documented in the Descriptive Report. Each of these methodologies is described below.\n113\n\n\f4.2.1.1.1 Combined Uncertainty and Bathymetric Estimator (CUBE)\nCUBE is a gridding algorithm developed at the University of New Hampshire (UNH)/NOAA Center for Coastal and Ocean Mapping Joint Hydrographic Center by Dr. Brian Calder. Its primary advantage over uncertainty weighted grids is that it is less susceptible to noise. CUBE works in two stages:\nIntegration of Soundings into Hypotheses - During the frst stage, all soundings in the area are grouped into\ninternally consistent depth hypotheses, using the uncertainty of the soundings as a threshold.\nDisambiguation - Afer all soundings are integrated, a second stage determines which hypothesis at each node is the most likely to be the seafoor. Tere are four disambiguation methods available:\n(a) Te density option selects the hypothesis with the greatest number of sounding samples.\n(b) Te locale option selects the hypothesis that is most consistent with its surrounding nodes that has only one hypothesis.\n(c) Te density and locale option selects the hypothesis with the greatest number of soundings and is consistent with neighboring nodes.\n(d) Te initialization option selects the hypothesis that is closest to an initialization surface created previously.\nTe CARIS HIPS integration of CUBE is well documented in the CARIS HIPS and SIPS User's Manual. Tis manual should be referenced for details on the workings of the algorithm and explanations of the user interface.\nWhen editing a CUBE surface, the user may opt to edit soundings or to edit hypotheses. For NOAA hydrographic survey data, it is critical that only sounding edits be used to correct gridding problems. Tis is primarily because hypothesis edits exist only in the context of a single grid, and will be lost if that grid is recomputed.\n4.2.1.1.1.1 CUBE Parameters\nTere is a small parameter fle called \"CUBEParams.xml\" that is referenced in the HIPS environment. Te values in this fle control the behavior of the CUBE gridding and disambiguation processes. Te default CUBE parameters are not authorized for NOAA surveys. Instead, feld units shall use the CUBEParams_NOAA.xml fle. Each of the following grid resolutions has its own CUBE parameter set: 0.5m, 1m, 2m, 4m, 8m, 16m, and 32m. Field units shall use the parameter set corresponding to the appropriate resolution(s) and depth ranges of their survey data as specifed in section 5.2.2 of the HSSD. A description of each parameter and its default value and allowable range of values can be found in the header of the XML fle.\nTree parameters have been modifed from the CARIS default values: Capture Distance Scale, Capture Distance Minimum, and Horizontal Error Scalar.\nTe Capture Distance Scale value is a percentage of depth used to limit the radius of infuence a sounding may have on the grid. Te system default value is 5.0. However, for all grid resolutions in the NOAA parameters fle, the value has been set to 0.5. Setting the value this low disables the function and forces the Capture Distance Minimum to be used instead over the range of applicable grid resolutions. Tis fxes the Capture Distance to the grid resolution. A value of 0.5 was determined to be low enough for all grid resolutions, since they grow with depth.\n114\n\n\fTe Horizontal Error Scaler value is used to scale the horizontal error of each sounding when used in the radius of infuence computation. It afects the propagated uncertainty of each sounding and how it is combined into each hypothesis. Te system default value is 2.95. However, based on discussions with Dr. Calder, the value has been set to 1.96, for all grid resolutions in the NOAA parameters fle.\nTe Capture Distance Minimum value is minimum distance that the CUBE algorithm will search for soundings to contribute to a node. It is used in conjunction with the Capture Distance Scale to limit the radius or infuence of a sounding. Te system default value is 0.5. Te Capture Distance Minimum is the only parameter that varies between the grid resolutions in the NOAA parameters fle.\nTe minimum capture distance radius is specifed in sections 5.2.2.1 and 5.2.2.2 of the HSSD and is limited to (0.707*grid resolution), or\nTis value defnes the capture distance to ensure that the radius of infuence touches the outer corners of the grid resolution but not farther. With this capture distance, no sounding is ever \"lost\" to the algorithm, but there is not an oversampling of data from areas signifcantly further than the grid resolution. Because all of the soundings are in close proximity to the node, the grid most accurately depicts the seafoor in that area without losing any soundings.\n4.2.1.1.2 Uncertainty Weighted Grids\nIn order to generate uncertainty-weighted BASE surfaces, TPU must be calculated for each sounding. TPU accounts for either the priori estimate or sensor recorded horizontal and vertical components of uncertainty associated with each sounding measurement. TPU is formulated from the summation of the modeled uncertainties for all sub-systems included in the overall hydrographic survey system (e.g., water levels, tide zoning, attitude sensor error, navigation sensor horizontal position error, sound velocity profle error, sonar bottom detection method, etc.). Te sources of uncertainty values include (or may be combination of) manufacturer specifcations, theoretical values, and empirical observations from the feld. A priori estimates values are entered into the HVF while sensor recorded values are applied from the recorded data during the Compute TPU process.\nOCS-recommended a priori uncertainty values are contained in the CARIS HVF Uncertainty Values document in Appendix 4. Te uncertainty values described in the appendix are provided as guidance for use in standard NOAA hydrographic surveys. Tese values do not cover the breadth of operations encountered by all feld parties, nor do they cover the range of equipment confgurations possible for any particular vessel. As such, these values should serve a starting point in developing a vessel's error model. Any deviation from the attached values should be completely described in the applicable Descriptive Reports and DAPR.\nIn general, soundings (observation points) do not coincide with grid nodes (BASE surface estimation points). To account for this, the vertical component of a sounding's TPU is propagated to a grid node according to a power law that models the increase in uncertainty as a function of three variables: distance between sounding and node, the sounding's horizontal component of TPU, and grid node resolution. Te amount of weight an observation exerts on a given BASE estimation point is inversely proportional to the propagated vertical uncertainty of the observation. See Figure 4.1 .\n115\n\n\fFigure 4.1: Model for propagated uncertainty in depth Where V and H are the vertical and horizontal components of TPU (resp.), SH is a scale factor representing the worst case error that horizontal TPU can contribute, xi and nj are the location of the sounding and estimation node (resp.), x and y are the two-dimensional spacing of grid nodes, and the exponent is a heuristic to control overall growth of propagated uncertainty, P . Te HIPS BASE surface algorithm uses a value of 1.0 (HIPS has already scaled H by 1.96, for a 95% confdence interval) and a value of 2.0. Teoretically, every sounding can afect every node in a BASE surface encompassing a survey area. For computational efciency, HIPS limits a sounding's radius of infuence on surrounding nodes through the following \"spreading conditions.\" (1) At a minimum, each sounding afects all nodes within a radius of 0.707 times the grid resolution of its position; i.e., within half the distance of the diagonal on a regular (square) grid. Hence, a given sounding will afect at least two to four nodes, depending on where it is situated with respect to the nodes. (2) Each sounding will propagate at most a distance determined by a user-specifed threshold of propagated vertical uncertainty. Te uncertainty threshold is expressed in HIPS according to an IHO sounding error model (see Figure 4.2 ); that is, an estimate of all constant errors (a) and depth-dependent errors (b times d) are summed in quadrature as shown in Figure 4.3.\nFigure 4.3: Generalized uncertainty growth curve with respect to sounding radius infuence (d). OCS requirements for the accuracy of measured depths, as set forth in the HSSD, are adapted from IHO S-44, Standards for Hydrographic Surveys, 5th Edition, which defnes Special Order (a=0.25 meters, b=0.0075), Order 1 (a=0.5 meters, b=0.013 or 1.3% of depth), and Order 2 (a=1.0 meters, b=0.023 or 2.3% of depth) standards. OCS specifes that the total sounding error in a measured depth at the 95 percent confdence level, afer systematic and system specifc errors have been removed, shall not exceed the IHO Order 1 standard in depths up to 100 meters and shall not exceed the IHO Order 2 standard in deeper waters. If either an IHO Special Order standard or a userdefned accuracy is required for a survey, these requirements will be stated in the Project Instructions.\n116\n\n\f4.2.1.1.3 Other BASE Weighting Methods in HIPS CARIS HIPS allows BASE surfaces to be generated using either swath-angle weighting, uncertainty weighting, or CUBE discussed in the previous section. Swath-angle weighted BASE surface nodes do not incorporate TPU and, hence, node \"uncertainty\" is not available therein. Unless specifcally stated to the contrary, use of the term \"BASE surface\" in conjunction with OCS hydrographic surveys refers to those surfaces generated using the uncertainty weighting method or CUBE. 4.2.1.2 BASE Node Attributes Te depth at a given BASE surface grid node, n, is the mean depth (weighted by propagated depth uncertainty) of the set of N soundings whose domain, Di, contains n. Likewise, the uncertainty at a given node is the mean uncertainty (weighted by propagated depth uncertainty) of all the soundings contained in set N. See Figure 4.4 Note that the depth at grid node n is the weighted mean of soundings 1, 2, and 3. Sounding 4 is not included because its radius of infuence does not encompass grid node n.\nFigure 4.4: Formulation of Base surface nodes from soundings.\n117\n\n\fIn addition to depth and uncertainty, users can include fve additional attributes in the BASE surface nodal data. Te defnitions of the seven nodal attributes are summarized below. Note that all node statistics are computed from the set of surrounding soundings whose propagated vertical uncertainty passes a user-supplied threshold (IHO Order): \u00b7 Depth - weighted-mean depth of soundings that contribute to a node; weighting is inversely proportional to\nthe propagated vertical uncertainty of the soundings. \u00b7 Uncertainty - weighted-mean vertical component of TPU of soundings that contribute to a node; weighting\nis inversely proportional to the propagated vertical uncertainty of the soundings. \u00b7 Density - number of soundings that contribute to a node. \u00b7 Std_Dev - standard deviation of soundings that contributed to the selected hypothesis at the 68%CI \u00b7 Node_Std_Dev \u00ad standard deviation of the soundings that contributed to the current grid node at the\n68%CI \u00b7 Shoal - shoalest sounding from the set of soundings that contribute to a node. \u00b7 Mean - sample mean of the set of soundings that contribute to a node. \u00b7 Deep - deepest sounding from the set of soundings that contribute to a node. 4.2.2 Bathymetry Processing Diagrams\nFigure 4.5: Processing fow diagram for VBES data.\n118\n\n\fFigure 4.6: Processing fow diagram for MBES data.\n4.2.3 Daily Batch Processing A number of processing tasks need to be performed on \"raw\" bathymetry data (i.e., unaltered data in the format recorded by the acquisition sofware) before any detailed analysis and evaluation can occur. Some of these daily tasks are interdependent, and the specifc sequence is critical. Te relevant daily batch processing tasks are listed below. Refer to the Bathymetry Processing Flow Diagram 4.6 for the appropriate ordering of steps.\n1. Conversion (Section 4.2.3.1 ) 2. Load Attitude/Navigation (Section 4.2.3.2 ) 3. Load Error Data (Section 4.2.3.3 4. Load Delayed Heave (Section 4.2.3.5) 5. Load Tides or Compute GPS Tides (Section 4.2.3.4 6. Sound Speed Correction (Section 4.2.3.6 ) 7. Merge (Section 4.2.3.7 ) 8. Compute TPU (Section 4.2.3.8 9. Filter (Section 4.2.3.9 ) 10. Add to Coverage BASE Surface (Section 4.2.3.10\n119\n\n\fMost of the tasks above can be semi-automated using the HIPS \"Batch Processor\" tool. Data format dictates how specifc batch processing actions should be confgured; thus, a separate HIPS Batch Processing File (.hbp) is needed for each raw data format type.\nIn general, all of the aforementioned tasks should be completed for any type of echosounder data. A basic set of batch processing fles can be specifed for each data type and reused on the appropriate set of survey lines acquired each day. In some circumstances, either creation of custom batch processing fles or manual processing of one or more tasks, line-by-line, in non-batch mode may be necessary. For example, conversion and fltering options may need to be customized to refect changes in echosounder performance as weather conditions varied throughout a survey day.\n4.2.3.1 Conversion\nCARIS HIPS supports numerous diferent data formats that can be used to record bathymetry. During conversion, HIPS uses the raw data to create a single, proprietary data format that will be used in subsequent CARIS processing routines. Tese fles in CARIS HIPS format are referred to as \"HIPS fles\" or \"HDCS fles\".\nDepending upon the system type and setup, recorded raw data may have been corrected for factors such as vertical (depth or height) ofsets, vessel motion, or acoustic refraction during acquisition. It is critical that HVFs account for any real-time corrections performed, so that \"double corrections\" do not occur during post-processing.\nIf an HVF error is discovered subsequent to post-processing, it may be necessary to reapply certain correctors and re-merge. Depending upon the error, a re-conversion may be required; however, most HVF settings do not impact the HIPS data conversion process. (HVF settings that can directly afect the data conversion process include VBES draf and MBES beam numbering.) Data processors should not automatically resort to time-consuming reconversion and re-processing of a signifcant amount of data upon discovering an HVF error. If unsure whether data repairs are necessary, the Survey Manager should consult, through his/her chain-of-command, the Hydrographic Systems and Technology Program for assistance.\nTe following sections contain guidance for converting common raw bathymetry data formats used by OCS into HDCS fles. Relevant background information is provided, followed by a table of guidelines for specifc HIPS and SIPS Conversion Wizard settings related to each raw bathymetry format.\nNote: HIPS uses the same Conversion Wizard as SIPS for a given raw data format. Options related to conversion of sonar imagery stored in raw MBES data are not addressed in this section; see section 4.3.2.1 for imagery conversion details.\n4.2.3.1.1 HYPACK\nHYPACK is the standard data format used by NOAA hydrographic feld units to log VBES and MBES data. HYPACK sofware is used to store data from a variety of MBES systems via an additional sofware module called HYSWEEP. For OCS hydrographic survey data, HYPACK VBES fles should be recorded using a DOY (erroneously termed \"Julian Date\" in the HYPACK sofware) fle extension. MBES data, recorded using HYSWEEP should be logged as ASCII *.HSX (HYSWEEP Survey Extension) fles.\nWithin the raw HYPACK fle, data recorded from each sensor in the acquisition system is assigned a \"device number.\" Tis numbering scheme will vary according to the specifc hardware confguration used to record the data. During conversion, device numbers can be specifed to correlate each sensor's data string with a specifc type\n120\n\n\fof data (e.g., echosounder, heading, navigation, etc.). If no device numbers are specifed, the converter will look for sensor data using known NMEA device strings. Specifying device numbers during conversion ensures that HIPS does not incorrectly identify a data string. Device numbers can be verifed by reviewing a raw HYPACK line fle in a text editor, such as WordPad, in which each device number will be listed adjacent to its respective device name.\n4.2.3.1.1.1 VBES Data\nWhen logging VBES data, HYPACK records depth values directly from the echosounder, rather than two-way acoustic travel times. For OCS hydrographic survey data, feld units must recalculate VBES depths using an actual measured sound speed profle during post-processing. HIPS will assume an estimated sound speed of 1500 m/s was applied to data during acquisition and uses that value to determine a two-way acoustic travel time for each sounding. HIPS can than recalculate VBES depths using a measured sound speed profle.\nNote: If using a VBES system in which the speed of sound through water can be manually entered, the hydrographer must enter 1500 m/s to facilitate the above HIPS process, as noted in section 3.2.3 .\nIf dual-frequency VBES data are being converted, high- and low-frequency soundings are stored side-by-side in the HYPACK raw data record. During conversion, each sounding will be fagged as either \"Primary\" or \"Secondary\" in the order in which it appears in the datagram. For example, if the high frequency depth is listed frst in the record and the user chooses \"Primary, Secondary\" for conversion, the high frequency depth will be fagged Primary and the low frequency depth will be fagged Secondary. Primary soundings are also fagged \"Selected\" by default in HIPS, and only Selected depths will be carried through to fnal processing. Users may override the Primary/ Secondary fagging assigned during conversion to force a depth into, or remove one from, the set of Selected depths.\nNote: In dual frequency systems, the low frequency beam width will be wider than the high frequency beam width. If the low frequency return shows a shoaler depth than the high frequency, it ofen indicates a feature ofset from the vessel trackline. Te least depth of such a feature may not have been captured by the low frequency signal; thus, the hydrographer should note the feature's position and perform a development.\n4.2.3.1.1.2 MBES Data\nConverting HYSWEEP MBES data is nearly identical to converting HYPACK VBES data. Te primary diferences are that the user must select raw *.HSX fles for conversion and choose the \"Multibeam\" option for soundings, rather than Single Frequency or Dual Frequency as would be required for converting VBES data. Device numbers should still be specifed as described in the beginning of this section.\n121\n\n\fOptions Single Frequency Dual Frequency\nMultibeam\n\nOCS Guidelines If Single Frequency VBES data is being converted, it will automatically be classifed as \"Primary\". Te OCS standard is to read in high frequency as \"Primary and low frequency as \"Secondary\".\nFor HYSWEEP MBES data, simply choose the multibeam option.\n\nStatic Draf Apply during conversion\n\nTypically, static draf should not be applied during conversion. Te OCS standard is for sensors to be referenced to a vessel RP and static draf to be accounted for via a \"waterline\" correction entered in the HVF. Refer to section 4.1.1.1.2.\n\nDevice Numbers\n\nIf the hardware setup in HYPACK is unambiguous, then blank device numbers may work fne; OCS recommends explicitly stating the device numbers during conversion.\n\nData acquired for OCS hydrographic surveys shall be\n\nSound Velocity\n\ncorrected for sound speed using actual measured sound speed profles. For HYPACK data, this process is\n\nperformed in HIPS.\n\nTable 4.3: OCS guidelines for converting HYPACK data.\n\n4.2.3.1.2 Simrad\nTe Simrad data converter is designed for use with data from Kongsberg Simrad multibeam systems, such as the EM 710, EM1002 and/or EM3000. Two notable options are available when converting Simrad data, shortening line names and decimating attitude data.\nSimrad generated survey line names can be quite long. During conversion, the user can opt to modify raw line fle names into 12-character HIPS line names using the format YYDDD_HHMMSS (2-digit year + DOY + integer hour, minute, second, based on the starting date and time of the line data).\nTo reduce fle size, attitude data can be decimated during conversion. Ofen, the output rate of attitude sensors used during multibeam data acquisition can be unnecessarily large (e.g., higher than 25 Hz), creating very large attitude data fles in HIPS. Te attitude data decimation factor determines the ratio of attitude data that is converted. For example, using a factor of 1 converts all data; a value of 10 converts every tenth attitude record.\n\nOptions\n\nOCS Guidelines\n\nShorten Line Names\n\nOCS recommends shortening line names.\n\nAttitude Data Decimation Factor\n\nA minimum attitude sample rate of 25 Hz is recommended by OCS. Do not decimate attitude data deyond this value, e.g. if attitude sample rate is 100 Hz, do not decimate attitude data by a factor greater than 4.\n\nTable 4.4: Guidelines for converting Simrad data.\n\n122\n\n\f4.2.3.1.3 Generic Sensor Format (GSF)\nGeneric Sensor Format (GSF) may be used to store data from a variety of VBES and MBES system confgurations. GSF is particularly well suited for storing data that have been subject to real-time corrections during acquisition. As noted in section [sec:Preparation-for-Data], any real-time corrections in the logged data must be accounted for when creating the HVF. Real-time corrections may also afect processing decisions made in HIPS.\nAs compared to the Daily Batch Processing steps presented in section [sub:Daily-Batch-Processing-SSS], the state of a given GSF dataset may range from raw (i.e., no corrections applied) to a condition where steps 2, 3, and 4 have already been completed. Te options for converting GSF data into HDCS fles are fairly simple because much of the behavior of the converter cannot be manipulated by the user. Te GSF format includes a standard ping fag defnition to indicate whether data are \"on line\" (e.g., data from a planned survey line) or \"of line\" (e.g., data in between lines, during turns, transits, etc.). Te only choice a user must make during HIPS conversion of GSF data is how to treat these of-line data.\n4.2.3.1.4 Extended Triton Format (XTF)\nTe eXtended Triton Format (XTF), created by Triton Imaging, may be used to store data from a variety of MBES systems. (Imagery data can also be acquired in the XTF format, as discussed in section 4.3.2.1.3 ) XTF datagrams are comprised of a Triton-defned \"header\" attached to an optional manufacturer-specifc sensor data packet. In the past, XTF was a common data format within OCS, primarily due to the widespread use of Triton Imaging's IsisSonar data acquisition sofware. However, since ISIS has been replaced by HYSWEEP on NOAA hydrographic feld units, MBES data is generally no longer acquired in XTF.\n4.2.3.2 Load Attitude/Navigation\nFor ERS based projects, the processed Smoothed Best Estimate of Trajectory (SBET) fles are loaded using the CARIS/HIPS Load Attitude/Navigation tool. Load Attitude/Navigation will overwrite any previously converted real-time attitude and navigation data. Te hydrographer can review/edit the attitude and navigation time series data using HIPS editors. For additional information regarding ERS see the Ellipsoidally Referenced Survey SOP. pdf in Appendix 4.\n4.2.3.3 Load Error Data\nTe CARIS/HIPS Load Error Data tool is used to override HVF TPU values with observed/computed uncertainty time-series values. For non-ERS projects the observed uncertainty time series in the POS PCS fles (.000) is used. For ERS-based projects, the processed error metrics fle that accompanies the SBET fle (smrmsg) is used in the CARIS/HIPS Load Error tool. During the CARIS/HIPS Compute TPU step (4.2.3.9 ) the hydrographer can indicate the uncertainty source: (HVF) Vessel Settings, Realtime Data or a Custom mix of uncertainty sources. For additional information regarding ERS see the Ellipsoidally Referenced Survey SOP.pdf in Appendix 4.\n4.2.3.4 Load Tides\nFor NOAA charting purposes, hydrographic sounding data must be merged with water level observations relative to the local \"chart datum,\" typically mean lower-low water (MLLW). Te HIPS Load Tide tool creates a water level height time series in each survey line directory that is appropriate for the position and time of each line.\n123\n\n\fIf tidal efects throughout a survey area are complex or if multiple water level stations are located nearby, an optional zone defnition fle (.zdf) can be used to express how the amplitude and phase of the tide within a given area is related to available water level station data. For each zone, a reference water level station, time corrector, and range corrector will be provided. Tis technique called discrete tidal zoning does not account for the efects of spatially varying harmonic and non-harmonic efects on the water levels. Te accuracies achieved by this method may be inconsistent from one survey area and/or time periods to others, and the resulting uncertainties may be difcult to quantify.\nA tide or water level fle must be loaded prior to merging data in HIPS, but actual water level data may not yet be available. Tus for daily data processing, a zero or predicted tide fle will ofen be used. If survey data were compensated for water level variances during acquisition or if water level measurements are not necessary for the survey area (e.g., some non-tidal rivers or lakes), a \"zero tide\" fle must still be loaded to enable the HIPS merge process.\nNote: Non-tidal areas are still subject to water level variances due to factors such as wind, rain, barometric pressure changes, and freshwater runof.\nIf preliminary or verifed water levels are available, the most accurate of these data should be applied (see section 4.2.5.1.1 ).\nNote: HIPS currently supports a \"weighted averaging\" option for zoned tides. Tis option applies data from multiple water level stations by weighting observed water level measurements based on the inverse of the station to- vessel distance. OCS does not recommend using HIPS \"weighed averaging,\" because the two-dimensional character of the survey area is not taken into account (i.e., the station-to-vessel distance vector may cut through land).\n4.2.3.4.1 Tidal Constituent and Residual Interpolation (TCARI)\nTidal Constituent and Residual Interpolation (TCARI) was designed for total water levels relative to Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW) at selected hydrographic survey areas along the coast by the spatial interpolation of tidal data. Te model spatially interpolates the harmonic constants (used to predict the astronomic tide), tidal datums, and residual water levels (i.e., the non-tidal component or the diference between the astronomically predicted tide and the observed water level) using the values at a combination of operational and historical stations. Te method works best in regions where there is an abundance of high quality tidal data surrounding the survey area. TCARI methodology has the potential to yield water level correctors with increased accuracy and reduced uncertainty.\nTe use of TCARI, just as in discrete tidal zoning, requires the hydrographer to evaluate and understand the tidal characteristics of the survey areas. Success in either method requires information from historical tide stations and other sources. Gaps in information limit both methodologies. And both methodologies require tide stations to be in operation during survey operations. TCARI frst requires the development of a model grid to cover the survey areas and then requires a spatial feld of harmonic constants from historical stations for the interpolation instead of just the average time and range of tide required by tidal zoning. Finally, TCARI planning requires an analysis of the non-tidal residual across the survey area to determine the location and number of stations to be in operation during the survey. TCARI grid fles, interpolation weighting functions, and harmonic constant fles are created during planning and sent to the survey platform. Survey vessels must obtain the observed data from the specifed tide stations during the survey so that TCARI can apply the interpolated water level residuals in the process.\n124\n\n\fBoth TCARI and traditional tidal zoning will be used and the applicable tool will be determined by CO-OPS in the planning stage on a survey by survey basis. CO-OPS will either send TCARI program fles or discrete zoning to the feld but not both. Field units receiving a TCARI grid from CO-OPS can load it into Pydro with water level data to create tidal reducers for the survey's bathymetry. Once TCARI has created the tide fles, the data can be merged in CARIS (loading tides option is not necessary, you will not need a .zdf fle).\nFor fnal tide correctors, the survey vessel should generate and submit a request for Final tides, stating on the request that TCARI was used for that particular survey.\nCO-OPS will review and quality control the TCARI grid sent to the survey vessel and if no discrepancies or problems are found, will send the vessel a note stating that the preliminary grid can be used for fnal tidal correctors. If CO-OPS fnds discrepancies or problems, then CO-OPS will re-evaluate and determine the best solution.\n4.2.3.4.2 Compute GPS Tide\nFor ERS based projects, the CARIS HIPS Compute GPS Tide function creates the HDCS GPSTide fle using the SBET converted GPSHeight and the loaded Ellipsoid to chart datum Separation Model (SEP, if any). An Ellipsoid to chart-datum model may consist of one of the alternate models described in Section 9.2 in the HSSDM. Computing GPSTide with a \"zero\" separation is used to maintain merged soundings relative to the Ellipsoid and a vertical datum transformation is applied during grid processing. Additional details regarding the application of GPS Tide can be found in the Ellipsoidally Referenced Survey SOP.pdf in Appendix 4.\n4.2.3.5 Load Delayed Heave\nIf POS MV TrueHeave was logged during data acquisition, these fles should be loaded using the HIPS Load Delayed Heave tool. Loading TrueHeave fles will not overwrite real-time heave values that are automatically recorded in a raw fle. However, once TrueHeave fles have been loaded, CARIS will automatically apply True Heave unless the user manually deletes the TrueHeave fles from the PVDL directory. Te hydrographer can review/edit the TrueHeave time series data using HIPS Attitude Editor. TrueHeave data will be applied to survey soundings during either HIPS SV Correct (if performed) or Merge, provided the \"apply in post-processing\" option for heave has been checked in the HVF.\nNote: Simrad data is typically compensated for real-time heave during acquisition. To avoid a double-correction, the Simrad-based TrueHeave algorithm in HIPS applies a vertical adjustment equal to the diference between TrueHeave and real-time heave.\n4.2.3.6 SV Correct\nCorrecting sonar data for the speed of sound (through water) actually refers to performing a refraction correction based on a sound speed profle of the water column. Variations in the speed of sound (primarily due to water temperature variations, or thermocline) result in refraction (bending) of sonar beams. Te speed of sound through water will decrease as water temperature lowers, causing a sonar beam to bend downward and creating depth and position errors in any measurement calculated based on travel time and an assumed linear travel path of the sonar beam. Figure 4.7 illustrates the efect of refraction. Te sound wave striking the thermocline at point B slows down, while point A on the same sound wave continues at the original speed until it strikes the thermocline at C. As a result, the sonar beam bends downward.\n125\n\n\fFigure 4.7: Sonar refraction due to thermocline.\nNote: Although ofen referred to as sound velocity correction, bathymetry data are actually corrected for sound speed, as only the scalar magnitude of velocity (i.e., speed) is used by HIPS. However, when referring to a specifc manufacturer's process, the manufacturer's terminology will be used in this manual, e.g., CARIS' terminology (sound velocity or SV) will be used when referring the CARIS procedure \"SV Correct\".\nIf sound speed corrections have not been applied in real-time during data acquisition, a HIPS Sound Velocity Correction must be performed using the SV Correct tool. Two stages of sound speed processing are possible in HIPS: (1) Adjustment of sonar beam (reported) launch angle through fat face refraction (FFR), which is not applicable for all MBES systems, and (2) adjustment of sounding horizontal position and depth through geometric beam ray-tracing. During HIPS SV Correct, survey line \"ObservedDepths\" data (alongtrack/acrosstrack position and depth with respect to the vessel RP) are recalculated from \"SLRange\" data (beam launch angle, one-way travel time) and corrected for acoustic refraction as well as (if indicated in the HVF) waterline, dynamic draf, heave, roll, and pitch.\nNote: the \"Apply\" box in the HVF must be checked for waterline, dynamic draf, and each attitude sensor for these data to be applied.\nIf any sensor smoothing was performed during post-processing, the user may choose to apply the smoothed heave, roll, and pitch sensor values during SV Correct.\nNote: Choosing the smooth sensor option will not afect survey data if smoothed coefcient data are not present. Te unsmoothed sensor data will be applied by default.\nFFR is very important to the beam forming process for MBES systems that use fat-faced transducers, and OCS recommends this process be performed during data acquisition. However, for certain Simrad fat-faced multibeam transducer types, HIPS is capable of performing FFR during post-processing.\nFor Simrad, FFR can be performed in HIPS if beam range and beam angle datagrams are present in the raw data. (Simrad EM data logged in Simrad Merlin/SIS RAW.ALL format includes the necessary datagrams; EM data logged in HYPACK HYSWEEP format does not.) A check box in the HIPS SV Correct dialog to \"Perform an additional recomputation of the steered beam angles based on a new surface sound speed that will be interpolated from the sound velocity profle\" controls whether or not HIPS will attempt FFR.\n126\n\n\fIf data quality issues dictate that FFR be performed during SV Correct, any SSP fles present in the HDCS data must frst be manually deleted.\nBeam ray-tracing is performed on all MBES data during HIPS SV Correct, regardless of echosounder type. Starting from the initial launch angle (reported or otherwise FFR-corrected), each sonar beam within a given survey line is processed as a ray refracting through the loaded sound speed profle and tracing a non-linear path. Te distance of this path is assumed equivalent to the measured one-way travel time for the beam. By calculating a more precise one-way travel time, a more accurate beam position and depth can be determined.\nTypically, a concatenated SVP fle (generated by NOAA's Velocipy sofware) that contains multiple sound speed profles, complete with metadata to indicate when and where observations took place, will be applied to survey data. In such cases, the user will need to choose a method for selecting how individual sound speed profles are applied. HIPS SV Correct provides four options: previous in time, nearest in time, nearest in distance, nearest in distance within time. Te method selected should be whichever will most accurately represent survey area conditions.\n4.2.3.7 Merge\nTe HIPS Merge process calculates \"Processed Depths\" (latitude, longitude, depth) by compensating \"Observed Depths\" (alongtrack/acrosstrack position and depth with respect to the vessel RP) for heading, navigation, and tide data. Merge will also apply vessel attitude, waterline, and dynamic draf if the data were not previously processed with SV Correct.\nNote: the \"Apply\" box must be checked for waterline, dynamic draf, and each attitude sensor in the HVF for these data to be applied.\nTe HIPS Merge tool can determine what corrections have been applied during SV Correct and will not perform a double correction for these sensors.\nIf any sensor smoothing was performed during post-processing, the user may choose to apply smoothed sensor values during Merge.\nNote: Choosing the smooth sensor option will not afect survey data if smoothed coefcient data are not present. Te unsmoothed sensor data will be applied by default.\nFor ERS based projects, use the \"Apply GPSTide\" option in the merge dialogue to select the GPSTide fle computed in section 4.2.4.3.2 .\n4.2.3.8 Compute TPU (Total Propagated Uncertainty)\nPrior to data processing, vessel ofsets and total propagated uncertainty values based on uncertainty estimates for survey equipment should have been entered into the corresponding HVF (see CARIS HVF Uncertainty Values document in Appendix 4).\nFor the most part, uncertainty estimates entered into the HVF fle are static over a feld season or in the absence of changes to the vessel confguration. Some HVF uncertainty estimate values may need to be adjusted on a case-bycase basis to account for any un-modeled uncertainty in a given component of the sounding. For example, in areas with strong currents, uncertainty in vessel speed can be adjusted in the sensor TPU section of the HVF to\n127\n\n\fcompensate for appreciable diferences between speed-over-ground and speed-through-water. Another critical example of TPU values that may need to be updated in the CARIS HVF is depth uncertainty introduced by heave in singlebeam data acquired on vessels without an attitude sensor. Survey days with substantial heave introduce a larger depth uncertainty than calm days, and require a larger TPU value in the heave section of the HVF. An estimation of uncertainty introduced by heave can be calculated by multiplying the heave amplitude (1/2 the wave height) by 0.707. (Tis formula is equal to 1 sigma of a sinusoidal wave).\nMost of the uncertainty estimates that are entered into a CARIS HVF are straightforward and are based on direct measurement techniques or manufacturer provided information. Te estimation of the uncertainty value associated with MRU alignment is an exception. Tere is no direct method to measure or estimate MRU alignment uncertainty. One method to estimate these values is to calculate the standard deviation of a large sample of angular bias values resolved with a patch test. Te sample size can be created either by a number of people resolving the angular biases or a couple of people resolving the values numerous times. Angular bias values resolved in a patch test are actually a measurement of the angular bias that exists between the transducer reference frame and the MRU reference frame. Terefore, any uncertainty values derived from the patch test angular biases are based on the same relationship. As it is the angle between the MRU and the transducer that we are measuring, rather than the absolute alignments of both the MRU and the transducer to a vessel reference frame, we can assign this uncertainty to either the MRU alignment or the transducer alignment. CARIS expects this value to be entered into the MRU alignment uncertainty feld.\nNote: All changes made to HVFs used to process OCS hydrographic survey data shall be approved by the feld unit's Chief-of-Party and completely described in the Descriptive Report. Provided the TPU sensor values in the HVF do not require modifcation as noted above, TPU computation for specifc survey lines is completed by selecting a set of survey lines and choosing the Compute TPU process in HIPS. Once the process has been selected, uncertainty values that change on a survey-by-survey basis, such as tide and sound speed, are entered into the Compute TPU dialog box (see below regarding Tide zoning uncertainty values for TCARI tides).\nCARIS allows for only one sound speed and one tide value to be entered per survey area, on a survey-wide basis (at BASE surface creation) in the Compute TPU dialog box. HSTP is working with CARIS to adapt a statistical approach which will allow for multiple values per survey.\nCertain error values in the HIPS vessel fle (HVF) may be overridden with real-time or post-processed error values. Prior to computing TPU, use HIPS Load Error Data from the Applanix POS PCS raw fle (.000) or the Applanix POSPac post-processed RMS fle (smrmsg ).\nRefer to Appendix 4 for an example of the CARIS Compute TPU Dialog menu.\n128\n\n\fTide zoning uncertainty values at the 95% confdence level for discrete zoning are provided by CO-OPS in the tide requirements document on the project CD. All error value components entered in CARIS for TPE calculation are assumed to be 1 sigma; therefore, the value provided by CO-OPS should be divided by 1.96.\nTide zoning uncertainty values for TCARI tides are loaded on a line-by-line basis using NOAA's Pydro-TCARI sofware. Pydro's Tides->CARIS TCARI Tide->\"Load TCARI Tide in HIPS PVDLs\" is used in place of CARIS HIPS Process->Load Tide. Tis operation in Pydro-TCARI loads both tide corrector and tide uncertainty data (HDCS \"Tide\" and \"TideErrorFile\", respectively) into a given survey line.\nFor ERS based projects, if a SEP has been used in the HIPS Compute GPSTide step (processed depths relative to MLLW), the associated vertical datum transformation uncertainty is currently entered in place of the tide values in the Compute TPU dialogue. Te VDATUM transformation uncertainty is based on the modeled maximum combined uncertainty (MCU) and will be provided by HSD. Additional details regarding the application of Load Error Data and Compute TPU can be found in the Ellipsoidally Referenced Survey SOP.pdf in Appendix 4.\nTe sound speed component of total propagated uncertainty is a function of environmental variability with respect to space and time and instrument/calibration uncertainty. Of the two, environmental variability has the greatest infuence. Sound speed has a complicated dependence on salinity, temperature and pressure with the greatest change in acoustic propagation speed occurring with the change in temperature between the surface and the lower limit of the thermocline.\nHSD has determined that the measured sound speed uncertainty may range from 0.5 to 4 m/s. Tis range depends on the spatial and temporal environmental variability and the frequency at which sound speed casts are taken. Casts taken at a high frequency (i.e. every 15 minutes or less) will capture the spatial variability better and lower the uncertainty values. HSD requires platforms to use the measured uncertainty values (i.e. TPU) for sound speed listed in the CARIS HVF Uncertainty Values document in the Appendix 4.\nField Units should note the 4 m/s uncertainty estimate (listed in the table from HTD-2 and HTD-10) for traditional sound speed casts is a conservative estimated variability value determined via Velocipy. Hydrographers can lower this uncertainty by increasing the number of casts for a given areas. Tus, feld units are strongly encouraged to utilize a high frequency cast system (e.g., MVP) whenever possible and especially in highly variable areas.\nSound speed uncertainty is the subject of continuing research and investigation at UNH CCOM/JHC. Velocipy has incorporated some of this research such as the Uncertainty Wedge Analysis (UWA) and statistically estimating sound speed uncertainty (ESS). See the Velocipy Operations Manual (included on the Hydrosof website)for more information. Future research is underway to create an algorithm to estimate the sound speed uncertainty value more accurately using temporal and spatial separation between the sound speed profles and soundings. . Field units which have not been trained in the proper use of the UWA and ESS within the Velocipy sofware should use the uncertainty values listed in the CARIS HVF Uncertainty Values document in the Appendix 4 but are welcome to test out the program.\nTe TPU values associated with surface sound speed have a smaller range and magnitude than measured sound speed (0.2 m/s to 2 m/s) because sound speed is continually measured at the transducer. Te sound speed uncertainty, therefore, is dictated by the sound speed gradient at the velocimeter's sensor head.\nIf feld units wish to deviate from the sound speed uncertainty values listed here, a review of the variability in the surface sound speed will be necessary to estimate the sound speed uncertainty for a given survey. If the feld unit can prove through detailed documentation and calculation that their calculated uncertainty is lower than those stated in the CARIS HVF Uncertainty Values document in Appendix 4), then the lower value may be used. As with any deviation from procedures specifed in the HTD's, FPM or the HSSD, methods for estimating uncertainty, and\n129\n\n\fjustifcation for this deviation, should be clearly described in the Descriptive Report as well as the Data Acquisition and Processing Report. Te feld should be aware, however, that if the processing branches disagree with the method used, any corresponding surveys using these uncertainty values may be returned to the vessel. Terefore, HSD strongly recommends that feld units communicate to the branch their proposed approach. If the branch feels the method is adequate, a detailed description of the method, corresponding calculations and data will need to be sent to HSD for verifcation (and dissemination to other feld units if approved). NOAA does not currently conduct sweep surveys, and the lower section of the TPU dialog box is not utilized.\nTe TPU values for each sounding ( ^V and^H , see propagated uncertainty equation in Figure 4.1) will be computed at the 95% confdence interval.\n4.2.3.9 Filter\nDepending upon data quality, the hydrographer may choose to flter a dataset during post-processing. HIPS provides several fltering tools that can be used to automatically fag data as rejected or accepted. Filtering methods commonly used for processing OCS hydrographic survey data include TPU (see section 4.2.3.8 ), sonar quality fags, angle from nadir, and depth threshold. Te TPU fltering option can be used to expeditiously reject soundings with uncertainty values that fall outside limits set for either an IHO order survey or some user-defned parameter. However, the hydrographer should keep in mind that it is the grid node depth that must meet survey specifcations, not each individual sounding. Tus, the TPU fltering tool may over clean data. MBES data can be fltered based on sonar quality fags and/or angle from nadir. Although fltering by sonar quality fags is not recommended by OCS, fltering based on angle from nadir may be useful when external conditions cause outer beams to degrade to the point of being unusable. Both MBES and VBES data may be fltered based on depth threshold. Tis method can be used to eliminate anomalous soundings resulting from double-echoes or near-surface refection such as propeller wash, entrained air, and marine life. Consult the CARIS HIPS and SIPS User's Manual for more information on fltering methods.\n4.2.3.10 Add to Coverage BASE Surface\nA BASE surface model should be created to demonstrate data coverage in accordance with section 5.2.2 of the HSSD. Each day, newly acquired data should be added to this surface for a quick coverage assessment and planning of the next day's surveying operations. Te hydrographer is reminded that AWOIS radii that extend beyond the basic survey limits must be entirely covered with 200% side scan, complete or object detection multibeam, or a combination thereof to be disproved by sonar data. Tese radii should be considered when evaluating survey coverage. Coverage requirements will vary based on the classifcation of MBES data assigned in the Project Instructions. Tree general classifcations for NOAA hydrography are Complete Multibeam, Object Detection, and Set Line Spacing. Typically when a BASE Surface is created to evaluate coverage, that day's bathymetric data have not yet been analyzed using directed-editing processes. Tus, the coverage BASE surface may need to be re-gridded periodically to verify that subsequent editing did not afect data coverage.\n4.2.4 Boat-day Processing\n\"Boat-day Processing\" as described in this chapter refers to that portion of hydrographic data processing that is performed on a single vessel's data that were acquired during a single day of data acquisition. Prior to commencing Boat-day Processing, all of the Daily Batch Processing tasks ( see section 4.3.3 should have been performed. For ships and launches, Boat-day Processing is typically accomplished during a \"night processing\" shif. For feld parties, this processing step is ofen saved for foul weather days or is accomplished by a shore party member in\n130\n\n\fcharge of daily data processing. For ERS based projects, boat-day processing includes generating POSPac SBET's for all survey vessels. Additional details regarding POSPac SBET processing can be found in the Ellipsoidally Referenced Survey SOP.pdf in Appendix 4.\nBoat-day Processing is based on the natural interpretive power of the human eye to evaluate a BASE surface for anomalous bathymetry, directing attention to areas that require review and/or editing (i.e., \"directed editing\") by an experienced hydrographer. Vertical exaggeration is a very useful tool to accentuate bathymetric features and artifacts on a \"sun-illuminated\" BASE surface. However, extreme depth scaling can make small features seem signifcant and/or make acceptable multibeam data appear riddled with problems. Scaling sun-illuminated depth layers by a multiplier of three to fve is generally a good choice for initial data review. If artifacts are perceived, the hydrographer can measure the vertical distance of the artifact (peak-to-trough) and compare this distance to the allowable vertical error for the survey to determine if the data is acceptable. If major data artifacts or issues are observed, the CST, FOO, or Team Lead should be informed in order to identify and resolve the issue.\nNote: In navigationally signifcant areas where no supporting imagery data exist (see section 4.3), special emphasis should be placed on the review and interpretation of bathymetry data and, as needed, supporting sensor time series data.\nIn most cases, data anomalies can be easily evaluated and edited using HIPS Subset Editor . However, complex areas may require additional line-by-line evaluation and editing via HIPS Swath Editor (see section 4.2.4.3.2 ).\nOnce data are merged, the hydrographer should review attitude and navigation time series data as described in sections 4.2.4.3.3 and 4.2.4.3.4 , then use the HIPS Single Beam Editor tool to review bathymetry data. Following this review, the most accurate water level data available should be applied (see section 4.2.5.1.1), and then the VBES data can be inserted directly into Pydro.\n4.2.4.1 Create Boat-day BASE Surface\nTe frst step in Boat-day processing is to create a CARIS BASE surface of the vessel's daily data using fnal gridded data specifcations as defned in section 5.2.1 of the HSSD. Initially the Boat-day BASE surface is used to direct the editing process (see section 4.2.4.3 ). Once editing and the appropriate checks are complete the Boat-day BASE surface can be regridded and added to a Survey-wide BASE surface that will, ultimately, be fnalized and submitted.\nAn option exists in the HIPS BASE surface creation process to add comments. Tese comments are included in the metadata stored in an XML companion fle with every BASE surface. In addition to having metadata in a separate fle, it is helpful to include some descriptive information in the BASE surface fle name. Te following BASE fle naming convention is an efective way to keep track of Boat-day surfaces:\nRegistry Number_Vessel Number_Day-of-Year_Resolution_<Lettered Index>\nFor example, the names for two Boat-day BASE surfaces created at a 2 meter resolution using RAINIER launch #4 data from day number 152 might look like: \"H12345_RA04_152_2m_a\" and \"H12345_RA04_152_2m_b.\"\n4.2.4.2 Review Boat-day BASE Surface\nOnce a Boat-day BASE surface has been created, it should be investigated for indications of data problems (artifacts) and features. A bathymetric feature is any object that may be of importance for nautical charting, such as a wreck, shoal, or other item that may need further investigation. Typically, the depth and standard deviation BASE surface\n131\n\n\flayers are most useful for identifying data anomalies (see list of BASE attributes in section 4.2.1.2 ). Te Properties Window can be used to assist the hydrographer with BASE surface review. Tis window allows the user to customize a BASE surface color map and adjust the azimuth and elevation of simulated sun illumination. Varying these settings helps highlight artifacts and features that may be hidden when viewed using only one set of display parameters. Te hydrographer should systematically inspect all BASE surfaces at least four times, moving the azimuth of the virtual sun 90\u00b0 each time while maintaining a moderate to low elevation. For example, azimuth values of 045\u00b0, 135\u00b0, 225\u00b0, and 315\u00b0 (northeast, southeast, southwest, and northwest) with a fxed elevation of 45\u00b0 is a common, and usually efective, series of settings.\nNote: If plotting BASE surfaces, a sun elevation of 45\u00b0 and azimuth of 315\u00b0 generally presents artifacts and features most accurately. A particular pixel-color can also be set as transparent. Choosing a transparent pixel of \"0\" will make the otherwise white background of the image transparent so that underlying data (charts, orthographic photographs, etc.) will be revealed.\nProblems that may be encountered in a MBES data set can generally be broken down into the following seven categories: refraction, attitude, position, heading, sonar, environmental, and tide. Each of these data problems is described below. For further guidance on which tools should be used to edit various data problems, see section 4.2.4.3 .\n4.2.4.2.1 Refraction\nAcoustic refraction-induced errors are caused when the speed of sound through the water column is not adequately modeled over time or space. When viewing data with refraction errors in the acrosstrack direction, the hydrographer will notice a \"smiling\" or \"frowning\" characteristic as shown in Figure 4.9 .\nFigure 4.9: HIPS Subset Editor view (bottom) of acoustic refraction-induced bathymetry errors, using BASE surface standard deviation image for reference.\nDepending upon the cause of this artifact, it may indicate a need for additional sound speed profles each day or more profles spatially over the survey area. Typically, the amount of time required to obtain additional sound speed profles is far less than that required to edit, or otherwise \"fx\", data aficted with acoustic refraction artifacts.\nHIPS Refraction Editor, a tool in Swath Editor, may be used to assist with troubleshooting refraction errors. Refraction Editor allows the user to enter a step sound speed correction at a specifed water depth. As sound speed corrections are entered, the efect is refected in the swath edit display by increasing or decreasing the curvature (smiling or frowning) of the swath.\nNote: HIPS does not account for TPU (see section 4.2.3.8 ) introduced by using Refraction Editor; thus, Refraction Editor is not approved for use in OCS hydrographic surveys and shall not be used for deliverable products.\n132\n\n\f4.2.4.2.2 Attitude Vessel motion artifacts may arise due to a failing accelerometer within the heave/pitch/roll sensor, a gap occurring in data transmission or recording, an inaccurate patch test (e.g., conducted in insufciently deep water for the given survey area), or unaccounted latency within the data acquisition system. An example of a gap in the recorded attitude time series is illustrated in Figure 4.10.\nFigure 4.10: BASE surface standard deviation layer (lef) of a survey line with data in attitude time series (right). If a specifc cause of vessel motion artifacts can be determined, it may be possible to repair the data. For example, a new patch test could be run, or data could be reprocessed to account for a known latency. In other cases, data may need to be either smoothed to minimize the artifact or rejected entirely. If systematic errors are found in a vessel's attitude data, the time spent trouble shooting the source of the problem will typically far outweigh the time required to continually edit data.\n4.2.4.2.3 Position Gross horizontal positioning errors are uncommon when using modern surveying equipment. Inertially-aided GPS navigation equipment, such as the Applanix POS/MV, uses Kalman fltering to constrain vessel speed, acceleration, and displacement, eliminating the majority of potential positioning errors. Te most common cause of error in an inertially-aided system is when the GPS portion of the position solution fails. Note: Due to the horizontal position accuracies required for OCS hydrographic surveys, loss of diferential GPS corrections should also be considered GPS failure. Te efects of temporarily losing diferential corrections are illustrated in Figure 4.11.\nFigure 4.11: HIPS Navigation Editor time-series showing positioning error caused by temporary loss of diferential corrections.\n133\n\n\fDuring a GPS failure, inertial navigation systems can dead reckon for approximately 30 seconds before errors accumulate to a level that produces unacceptable positioning. Te hardware/sofware interface for an inertial navigation system should be confgured to alert the user of failure events so that data acquisition can be suspended if position data becomes unacceptable. Positioning \"problems\" associated with horizontal uncertainty may be seen on areas of extreme slopes. For example, if the horizontal accuracy is approximately 4 meters, the vertical depth error on a slope of 60\u00b0 would be almost 7 meters. Inconsistencies will be observed from swath to swath in these areas due to the horizontal positioning error. Keep in mind that horizontal uncertainty is factored into the BASE node uncertainty calculation, and may adequately account for what appears to be positioning errors on steep slopes (see section 4.2.1.1 ).\n4.2.4.2.4 Heading Heading errors can be induced by a faulty sensor or an incorrect heading alignment correction entered in the HVF. Tis problem can be easily identifed as a break in continuity of linear features from one swath to the next. During data acquisition, heading values are sometimes included in datagrams from sensors other than the primary navigation system. However, the accuracy of heading data will vary depending upon its source. If heading errors are discovered, it may be possible to re-process the data using heading information from another source. Te feld unit's FOO or equivalent should be notifed if an alternate heading source (e.g., calculated course-over-ground) is used to process survey data, as TPU (see section 4.2.3.8 values in the HVF may require editing.\n4.2.4.2.5 Sonar Sonar-induced data problems are typically caused by inappropriate settings in the sonar system. Tese may include unoptimized power, gain, and threshold settings, as well as improper range settings for the depth of water. Any of these circumstances could prevent the sonar from accurately representing the sea foor. Te best way to minimize sonar-induced errors is by having a well-trained and attentive operator during data acquisition.\n4.2.4.2.6 Environmental Environmental data problems are those caused by objects or disturbances in the water column, such as marine life, vegetation, entrained air from passing vessels, or weather-induced disturbances from heavy seas or rain. Figure 4.12 shows an example of environmental noise which occurred near the transducer face.\nFigure 4.12: HIPS Swath Editor view (lef) and BASE surface standard deviation layer view (right) showing water column noise near transducer.\n134\n\n\fAs with all data problems, environmental data issues are most efectively addressed during the acquisition stage rather than during processing. Depending upon the severity of data problems, acquisition may need to be suspended until environmental conditions have improved.\n4.2.4.2.7 Tide\nTide errors can result from inaccuracies in any of the source data used in the vertical datum transformation algorithm, such as inaccuracies in the water level observations, tide zoning model, or navigation. Tis type of error is ofen identifed by a measurable vertical ofset visible when data are viewed in the acrosstrack direction, as shown in Figure 4.13 .\nFigure 4.13: HIPS Subset Editor view of tide-induced bathymetry errors (bottom), using BASE surface standard deviation image for reference (top).\nIf tide errors are identifed, the hydrographer should ensure that the correct water level data have been loaded for the suspect dataset. Keep in mind that predicted tide fles do not account for water level efects due to nonastronomical forces. Tus, what appears to be a data problem may correct itself once observed water level data are applied. However, the varying accuracies and unquantifed uncertainty of tide correctors resulting from discrete zoning have the potential to result in tide-induced bathymetry errors even when using actual tide gauge data rather than predictions. If there are no other hydrographic sources of this error, this would indicate that either the tide gauge locations are inadequate and/or the method of discrete tidal zoning cannot account for the complex hydrodynamics of this survey area.\n4.2.4.2.8 ERS SBET Height Errors\nTis type of error may be identifed by a measurable vertical ofset visible when data are viewed in the across track direction, similar to a tide error. Additional details regarding ERS SBET quality control can be found in the Ellipsoidally Referenced Survey SOP.pdf in Appendix 4.\n4.2.4.3 Directed Editing from Boat-day BASE Surface\nOne or more of the HIPS data \"editors\" can be used to analyze data artifacts and features of interest that are identifed on the Boat-day BASE surface. With the exception of VBES data, depth values cannot be directly edited or changed in HIPS; rather, soundings can be fagged with various attributes, including \"rejected\" which will suppress a sounding from further processing steps. Daily review and fagging of features is strongly recommended to maintain an organized and complete survey. Supporting sensor data can also be fagged as being rejected, either with or without interpolation.\n135\n\n\fSubset Editor is the most frequently used HIPS editing tool and allows the most fexibility in addressing a problem that is concentrated in one geographic area. OCS recommends the use of \"Subset Tiles\" with 10% overlap to track editing progress in Subset Editor. Once defned, subset tiles may be fagged as either \"Complete\" (green), \"Partially Complete\" (yellow), or \"Incomplete\" (red) to identify areas that have been investigated, need a second review, or have not yet been edited, respectively.\nIn some cases, it may be benefcial to review individual sonar pings in a specifc line of survey data. Tis type of line-by-line editing can be performed in HIPS Swath Editor. If potential problems in either attitude or position data are noticed, the Attitude Editor or Navigation Editor tool can be used to review individual sensor time series data. Each of these four data editing tools is described in greater detail below. Refer to the CARIS HIPS and SIPS User's Manual for further information on any of these tools.\n4.2.4.3.1 Subset Editor\nSubset Editor enables the hydrographer to review and edit a \"subset\" of the entire sounding dataset, and corresponding BASE surface data, by geographic area. Subsets are rectangular in shape and will contain all soundings acquired within the geographic boundaries of the subset. Subsets can be created in a north-south or a rotated orientation. Rotating a subset can be useful to obtain a profle view when inspecting data along slopes or dredged channels.\nWhen using Subset Editor, the hydrographer should be aware of the data display settings, particularly vertical exaggeration and whether rejected soundings are displayed. If vertical exaggeration is set to \"Auto,\" then the display will rescale as soundings are edited. Tis feature creates a potential for the user to become focused on very fne details in the seafoor and essentially edit data to create a smooth bottom, which rarely exists. Te hydrographer must take care not to \"over clean\" data in this fashion. Displaying rejected soundings allows the user to see data that has been previously rejected, typically by a fltering routine in Swath Editor or editing by another hydrographer. Viewing rejected data is ofen valuable when investigating the validity of a possible feature.\n\u00b7 Individual soundings or groups of soundings may be selected and fagged in Subset Editor. Available data fags and each fag's purpose with respect to OCS hydrography are as follows:\n\u00b7 Reject - Flag anomalous soundings as \"rejected\" to suppress them from being included in subsequent processing steps, such as in the calculation of BASE surface grids.\n\u00b7 Reject Swath - Tis fag sets the \"rejected\" fag for all soundings in a selected swath. Use this function to reject a single ping or a continuous section of fawed sonar pings.\n\u00b7 Outstanding - Tis fag may be set for any data point that holds particular hydrographic signifcance. Typically, if the identity, extent, or validity of a feature is uncertain, it should be fagged as \"outstanding.\" NOAA Pydro sofware treats soundings fagged \"outstanding\" in HIPS as bathymetry features. Pydro establishes a connection to the HDCS data for all \"outstanding\" soundings and will automatically update the HDCS data for any subsequent fag changes made in Pydro during feature processing (see section 4.4 ).\n\u00b7 Examined - Tis fag does not currently have a defned meaning for OCS hydrographic survey data; however, it can be used by the surveyor as a means of marking a sounding for future reference. Tis fag can also be used to separate a group of soundings for non-standard data analyses.\n\u00b7 Designate - Applying the \"Designate\" fag to a sounding will force the BASE surface grid node closest to that\n136\n\n\fsounding to assume the exact depth value of the designated sounding, ignoring all other soundings within the area of infuence of this node. Pydro regards soundings fagged \"designated\" in HIPS as \"designated\" bathymetry features in Pydro. Pydro establishes a connection to the HDCS data for all \"designated\" soundings, and subsequent fag changes or edits made to the bathymetry feature in Pydro will automatically be refected in the HDCS data.\n4.2.4.3.2 Swath Editor\nSwath Editor enables the hydrographer to review and edit a single swath of data from four orthogonal directions as well as from a three dimensional perspective.\nNote: Data viewed in Swath Editor are not geo-referenced, but displayed with respect to acrosstrack and alongtrack distances from the transducer. Data problems that appear to be limited to the extent of a single line of data are ofen best addressed using Swath Editor. As when using Subset Editor, individual soundings or groups of soundings may be selected and fagged in Swath Editor. HIPS data fags and their purpose in OCS hydrography.\nNote: \"Outstanding\" and \"Examined\" fags can not be applied using Swath Editor.\nSwath Editor also allows the user to view amplitude (i.e., backscatter or side scan) data from a multibeam echosounder. Amplitude data can provide valuable insight for determining if a particular sounding or group of soundings is a real feature.\n4.2.4.3.3 Attitude Editor\nAttitude Editor allows the hydrographer to review and edit heading (gyro), heave, pitch, and roll data. Attitude Editor displays each sensor's time series data for a single survey line. HIPS provides three means of editing attitude data, rejecting (with or without interpolation), fltering, and smoothing.\nFor data problems of limited extents in time, rejecting is generally the preferred editing method. Tere are two options for rejecting attitude data: \"Reject-with interpolation\" and \"Reject-break interpolation.\" Rejecting data with interpolation will ft a straight line from the last good data point before the segment rejected to the frst good data point afer the segment rejected. Caution should be exercised when using this tool. Rejecting and interpolating sections of attitude data across the peaks of a signal will result in distorting the maximum observed amplitude at that time, as illustrated in Figure 4.14 .\nFigure 4.14: interpolation across region `A' will most likely create an artifact of its own, whereas interpolation across region `B' will not adversely impact the sounding data.\nRejecting without interpolation should be used to edit attitude data corruption occurring over an extended period of time. A general rule of thumb is to divide the allowable data gap distance for the survey by the vessel speed in meters-per-second to determine when to begin breaking interpolation. For example, if a 5 meter resolution grid is required to demonstrate adequate data coverage and the vessel speed is 5 m/s (~10 knots), regions of bogus data\n137\n\n\fgreater than or equal to 1 second (5 m \u00f7 5 m/s = 1 s) should be rejected without interpolation. Te Hydrographer should note that breaking interpolation will create a gap in the data. When the fles are merged, this option rejects all sounding data recorded during the time period in which sensor data were rejected, thus leaving a holiday in data coverage.\nFor attitude data problems that are systematic throughout the time series, fltering or smoothing is typically the best editing approach. Te hydrographer is cautioned that flters are powerful tools and should be used sparingly and with great care. Attitude Editor provides two fltering options: \"Moving Average\" and \"Fast Fourier.\" Te Moving Average option calculates a mean for each data point according to a user-specifed number of neighboring data points (in time or number) or \"box size.\" Te Fast Fourier method performs low-pass fltering on the sensor data according to a user specifed signal period (in time or number-of-points).\n4.2.4.3.4 Navigation Editor\nNavigation Editor allows the hydrographer to review and edit the vessel's navigation time series. Te navigation time series can be edited in HIPS using rejection with or without interpolation. When rejecting data, the Navigation Editor tool ofers two interpolation methods: Linear and Bezier. Linear interpolation is suitable if the majority of navigation positions are clean and do not deviate signifcantly from neighboring positions. Bezier interpolation is suitable if the original data is noisy. Linear interpolation simply calculates new positions over the rejected segment by connecting bounding positions with a straight line. Bezier interpolation calculates new positions over the rejected segment by ftting a Bezier curve through bounding positions, producing a resultant curve that may not necessarily connect or pass through all navigation positions on the line.\nTo help expedite data inspection, Navigation Editor provides \"spike detection.\" Tis tool will search the navigation time series for user-defned \"jumps\" in speed and time. Each jump will be highlighted so that the hydrographer can decide how best to edit the data. Large jumps in speed, calculated as distance traveled divided by time between fxes, can detrimentally afect the vessel's dynamic draf computation. Data artifacts due to speed jumps will be more pronounced if the slope of the vessel's speed versus dynamic draf is steep. A general rule-of-thumb is to interpolate speed jumps if they exceed the TPU (see section 4.2.3.8 modeled for vessel speed in the HVF, but this becomes less critical if a vessel's speed versus dynamic draf slope is small. Since speed and time jumps are directly related and speed is used to determine dynamic draf, it is not necessary to separately edit time jumps.\n4.2.4.4 Update Survey-wide BASE Surface\nOnce directed editing has been completed, the Boat-day BASE surface should be recomputed to verify that all edits were successful. If no further editing is necessary, the Survey-wide BASE surface should be updated, using fnal gridding parameters, to refect the current survey status.\nFor ERS based projects, if no SEP has been used in the HIPS Compute GPSTide step (processed depths relative to the Ellipsoid), then boat day and survey-wide BASE surfaces must be transformed to chart datum for sounding review and the determination of DTON's. See section 4.2.5.1.2 for guidance.\n4.2.5 Survey-wide Processing\n\"Survey-wide Processing\" includes many of the steps and skills discussed previously in this chapter. Te diference is the context in which these steps are accomplished. During Boat-day processing, a single \"boat-day's\" worth of bathymetric data is being viewed, edited, and fagged for internal consistency, gross errors, and any features that\n138\n\n\fwarrant further investigation. During Survey-wide processing, survey bathymetry and imagery data are examined in context with existing chart information and any additional supporting data available. Survey wide data analysis can be performed relative to Ellipsoid or chart datum as most appropriate.\nMany of the steps involved in processing hydrographic surveys are iterative and may be conducted in parallel with each other. Efciency can be increased by conducting many of the Survey-wide processing steps concurrently with Boat-day processing for global quality control and general survey completeness. Tese processes would include verifying adequate investigation of charted features within the survey sheet limits, reviewing the data for DTONs, and verifying that data coverage meets the assigned specifcations. Reviewing these points on a daily basis will help to ensure a complete survey and a timely submission.\n4.2.5.1 Vertical Datum Transformation\n4.2.5.1.1 Apply Water Level Correctors (non-ERS)\nPreliminary water levels are 6-minute water level measurements that have undergone rudimentary data consistency checks in the CO-OPS Data Processing and Analysis System (DPAS). Any gaps in data coverage will remain in these preliminary data, and measurements may, or may not, have been reduced to the local MLLW datum. Preliminary water levels should be available within hours, if not minutes, of data acquisition. Verifed water levels have gone through CO-OPS' processing, analysis and quality assurance processes, and any gaps in data have been recovered or interpolated through a process which utilizes nearby gauge data. Afer a preliminary or accepted datum has been computed, 6-minute verifed water levels are made available referenced to MLLW.\nNote: Field units shall submit, via email, a request for fnal tides to fnal.tides@noaa.gov within 24-hours of completing data acquisition for a survey (see section \"5.2.2.3.3).\nOnce a request for tides is received, CO-OPS will review the survey tide requirements to determine if adjustments or corrections are required. If CO-OPS needs to make any modifcations, they will provide fnal water level correctors to the feld unit. If no changes are required, CO-OPS will provide the feld unit with an ofcial fnal tide note stating that preliminary zoning, (and associated .zdf fle) will be accepted as the fnal zoning; thus, verifed water levels applied using preliminary zoning will be equivalent to fnal water level correctors. CO-OPS should respond to the feld unit within two weeks of receiving a Request for Tides. Verifed 6-minute water levels and fnal water level correctors should be applied as soon as these data are available. See sections 4.2.3.2/ and 4.2.3.5 for details regarding the application of water levels in HIPS.\n4.2.5.1.2 Apply Ellipsoid to Chart Datum Separation Model (SEP)\nFor the 2014 feld season, the processes and tools for applying SEP to CARIS processed bathymetry grids are being developed. Te process will involve the following basic steps:\n1. Ellipsoidally referenced grid surfaces are read from CARIS.\n2. Grid math is performed (currently outside of CARIS) to apply the project SEP model (VDATUM or ERZT) datum and datum uncertainty.\n3. Te adjusted surface data is read back into CARIS now referenced to chart datum (MLLW) with appropriate vertical datum transformation uncertainty applied.\n139\n\n\f4.2.5.2 Assess Bathymetry Features\nTroughout the survey process, bathymetric contacts should be periodically assessed and a determination made as to whether \"development\" is necessary. Developing a bathymetric contact typically refers to acquiring additional MBES data over the feature to increase sounding density and determine, or verify, a least depth. However, other methods of obtaining a least depth may be used, such as VBES or DLDG.\nBathymetric contacts are ofen easily identifed and corresponding HDCS data can be fagged during examination of the BASE surface depth or standard deviation layers. Soundings fagged \"examined\", \"outstanding\", or \"designated\" can then be highlighted using the HIPS \"Display Critical Soundings\" command. However, bathymetric features should also be assessed in Pydro, which enables the hydrographer to analyze each item in context with other available data sources such as the chart, imagery data, DPs, and AWOIS records/search radii. (Refer to section 4.4 for additional details.) Within Pydro, the hydrographer can easily evaluate bathymetric features to determine if any are DTONs. Comparisons should also be made between sounding data and existing charted depths. If survey soundings indicate deeper water than the charted depth(s), the charted depth should be treated as a feature and additional data acquired, as necessary, to verify that the charted depth is incorrect. (Tis process is ofen referred to as a charted sounding investigation.) Bathymetric features should be evaluated for signifcance and data coverage and, if appropriate, fagged within Pydro for \"investigation,\" as detailed in section 4.4 .\n4.2.5.3 Review Survey-wide BASE Layers\nTe fnal Survey-wide BASE surface to be submitted shall be created in accordance with section 5.2.1 and 5.2.2 of the HSSD. Prior to fnalization, BASE layers should be reviewed to ensure that the gridded surface truly refects the conditions in the survey area, meets specifcations assigned in the Project Instructions and that all features have been adequately investigated. Both mainscheme lines and crosslines should be included in the fnal BASE surface.\n4.2.6 Finalize Bathymetry Data\nFor survey submission, BASE surfaces must be fnalized in HIPS. Tis process is explained in detail in the CARIS HIPS and SIPS User's Manual. Finalizing BASE surfaces serves three purposes:\n\u00b7 To apply Designated soundings: In some instances, due to the nature of the weighting algorithm, a BASE surface does not accurately represent the least depth of a navigationally signifcant feature (typically a fne item such as a tall, narrow coral head or a shipwreck's mast). In such cases, a sounding can be fagged as Designated to force the nearest BASE surface grid node to honor the depth of the designated sounding. Refer to the following subsection for guidance on selecting Designated soundings. Designated soundings are applied to the BASE surface during the Finalize step in CARIS by checking the \"Apply designated soundings\" option.\n\u00b7 To assign grid nodes a fnal uncertainty: A grid node's fnal uncertainty can be assigned as one of three options: 1) that node's a priori uncertainty-weighted uncertainty, i.e., predicted error, 2) the grid node's standard deviation scaled to a 95% confdence interval, i.e., observed error, or 3) the greater of the two. For OCS hydrographic survey data, the \"greater of the two\" option shall be used to maintain a conservative uncertainty estimate.\n\u00b7 Defne depth thresholds: A single-resolution grid will generally not be appropriate for an entire survey area. To maintain the optimal resolution for a given depth range, the fnalize process flters out a desired depth range for each diferent grid resolution created.\n140\n\n\f4.2.6.1 Designate Bathy Features\nSince the calculated depth at each grid node of a BASE surface is infuenced by multiple soundings, the least depth of a feature may not always be accurately represented in the gridded data. Prior to creating a fnalized BASE surface collection, the hydrographer must systematically review signifcant feature least depths to ensure they are accurately portrayed by the BASE surface.\nIf a specifc least depth sounding is preferred over the weighted mean-depth calculation for the associated BASE surface grid node, that sounding should be fagged Designated. Te Designated fag can be applied in either HIPS or Pydro. If a sounding is made Designated in one sofware package, this fag will automatically carry through to the other application. Designated soundings shall be selected in accordance with section 5.2.1 and 5.2.2 of the HSSD.\nA common area of confusion is the preferred spatial density of designated soundings. It is easy to lose ones sense of scale when viewing data in subset editor. Sand ripples can look like mountains and small rocks appear like house sized boulders. Te hydrographer shall take a holistic view of the surrounding bathymetry to help determine the hydrographic signifcance of a feature before designating a sounding. When there are a group of features near each other (e.g. they would be shown as a single sounding or charted feature at the scale of the survey), only the shoalest sounding on the feature with the most representative shoal depth shall be selected.\nAs discussed in the Specifcations and Deliverables section 5.2.1.2, the hydrographer should use discretion in designating soundings on features. In the example below, the pile of rocks on the lef hand side of the image would only require one designated sounding although there are two `peaks' in the rock pile. Te single designated sounding would be adequate to chart the least depth of the group of features. Te next feature to the right (a submerged piling) would have a designated sounding at the least depth. Te buoy, anchor chain, and buoy block should have no designated soundings. Te pair of pilings which are exposed and charted as pilings would not have designated soundings, they are not features that would be charted with a sounding. Te pilings on the pier on the far right would not have any designated soundings, nor would any objects under the pier as they would not be charted.\nFigure 4.15: Designated Bathy Feature\n4.3 Imagery Processing\nNOAA hydrographic feld units typically acquire three types of imagery data: side scan sonar (SSS), MBES backscatter, and MBES \"side scan\" which is available as an option on some systems. True side scan sonars produce superior imagery for object detection purposes and are used to meet object detection requirements for OCS hydrographic surveys.\n141\n\n\fNote: Backscatter data and side scan imagery acquired in conjunction with MBES bathymetry, is ofen processed as an aid for data analyses but is not approved by OCS for meeting hydrographic survey object detection requirements. Te procedures outlined in this section are required only for SSS imagery being used to meet OCS object detection criteria, and are not applicable to MBES imagery data unless noted as pertaining to a specifc MBES system or \"backscatter\" data.\n4.3.1 Imagery Object Detection Imagery data are acquired and processed with the purpose of detecting objects that may be of navigational signifcance. Tis determination is typically based on contact type, position, and height above the sea foor estimated from the item's acoustic shadow on the SSS record. Imagery data acquired for OCS hydrographic surveys are geographically referenced; thus, a position can be determined for each contact identifed. Te accuracy of this position will vary depending on whether the sonar was towed or hull-mounted, but either method should be sufcient to locate the item for further investigation. If a contact is determined to be signifcant, a \"development\" should be conducted to determine the item's least depth and a more accurate position for charting.\nFigure 4.16: Basic data processing fow chart for SSS data. 4.3.2 Daily Batch Processing Several processing tasks need to be performed on \"raw\" imagery data (i.e., unaltered data in the format generated by the acquisition sofware) before any detailed analysis and evaluation can occur. Some of these daily tasks are interdependent, and the specifc sequence is critical. Te recommended ordering of daily batch processing tasks is as follows:\n1. Conversion 4.3.3.1 2. Filter, if applicable 4.3.3.2\n142\n\n\f3. Recompute Towfsh Navigation 4.3.3.3\n4. Slant Range Correction 4.3.3.4\n5. Add to Mosaic 4.3.3.5\nMost of the tasks above can be semi-automated in HIPS/SIPS using the \"Batch Processor\" tool. Data format determines how specifc processing actions need to be confgured; as such, a separate Batch Processing File (.hbp) is needed for each raw data format type.\nIn general, all of the aforementioned tasks should be completed for any type of imagery data being used to meet OCS hydrographic survey specifcations. A basic set of batch processing fles can be specifed for each sonar type and reused on the appropriate set of survey lines acquired each day. In some circumstances, either creation of custom batch processing fles or manual processing of one or more tasks, line-by-line, in non-batch mode may be necessary. For example, conversion and fltering options may need to be customized to refect changes in sonar performance as weather conditions varied throughout a survey day.\n4.3.2.1 Conversion\nCARIS SIPS supports many diferent data formats that may be used to record imagery. During conversion, SIPS uses raw data to create fles in CARIS' proprietary format which will be used in subsequent CARIS processing routines. Tese fles in CARIS SIPS format are referred to as \"SIPS fles\" or \"HDCS fles.\"\nFor towed SSS confgurations, a calculated \"towfsh position\" may have been recorded in the raw data depending upon the acquisition sofware being used. Tis calculation requires cable out and towfsh depth (or water depth minus towfsh altitude). If cable out and either towfsh depth or water depth and towfsh altitude were logged during acquisition, towfsh position can be re-calculated during post-processing via SIPS Recompute Towfsh Navigation (see section 4.3.2.3 . Either method of positioning should be adequate for standard SSS operations. However if recomputing towfsh navigation, the hydrographer should frst review and edit, if necessary, cable out and towfsh depth. For hull-mounted confgurations, sonar ofsets should be accounted for in the HVF as vessel RP-to-towpoint values.\nNote: Recompute Towfsh Navigation must be performed for vessel RP-to-towpoint to be applied. For hullmounted confgurations (i.e., no cable out data recorded), towfsh navigation will be recomputed using a cable out value of zero.\nIf an error is discovered in the HVF during SSS post-processing, re-conversion may not be required to correct the data. If unsure whether data repairs are necessary, the Survey Manager should consult, through his/her chain-ofcommand, the Hydrographic Systems and Technology Program for guidance.\nTe following sections contain guidance for converting common raw imagery data formats used by OCS into HDCS fles. Relevant background information is provided, followed by a table of guidelines for specifc Conversion Wizard settings related to each raw imagery format.\n143\n\n\f4.3.2.1.1 Sensor Data Format (SDF)\nSensor Data Format (SDF) may be used to store data from Klein System 3000 or Klein System 5000 side scan sonar systems. Conversion parameters will vary slightly depending upon the SSS system used to acquire the data. Te SDF data format is generated by Klein Associates' proprietary sofware package SonarPro.\nIf data were acquired using a Klein 3000 dual frequency (100 kHz and 500 kHz) side scan sonar, the user must choose which frequency to convert. Choose the \"high\" option to convert 500 kHz data and \"low\" to convert 100 kHz data. Typically, higher frequency data will provide better imagery resolution, while lower frequencies travel further and can be used at larger range scales.\nIf data were acquired using a Klein 5000 dynamically focused multibeam side scan sonar, the user must choose whether or not to convert hidden beams. Tere are fve beams on each channel (port and starboard) of the Klein 5000. Based on range scale and towfsh speed, the system will determine the number of beams necessary to achieve 100% coverage. Typical range scales and speeds used for hydrographic surveying require that 3 - 4 beams be used. Selecting \"convert hidden\" forces all 5 beams to be converted and may improve imagery in high yaw-rate conditions (e.g., in turns or for hull-mount confgurations) or aid in detection of very small objects during activities such as search and recovery. However, for the purposes of a basic OCS hydrographic survey, converting hidden beams is not necessary to meet survey specifcations and can introduce data management problems by signifcantly increasing fle sizes.\nTowfsh depth is used to calculate towfsh navigation in SIPS. Both the Klein 3000 and 5000 systems are equipped with a pressure sensor installed in the towfsh body to determine towfsh depth. Each towfsh will have a pressure sensor rated for 100, 300, or 1000 psi, depending on the anticipated operating depths. Te hydrographer must know the pressure sensor rating for the specifc towfsh used to acquire data.\nBoth the Klein System 3000 and System 5000 towfsh are equipped with a magnetic-based heading sensor. Tis sensor's data are logged as SSGyro. Typically, a magnetic compass does not indicate true headings and must be corrected for magnetic declination (variation) and deviation to obtain a true heading. Electrical interference could also contribute to a loss of both accuracy and precision of the SSGyro. Due to these inaccuracies, OCS does not recommend using towfsh heading sensor values (SSGyro) for processing survey data.\nVarious side scan sonar systems may record imagery at diferent resolutions. Both Klein System 3000 and System 5000 imagery data are recorded at a resolution of 12 bits. When converting SDF fles, choosing an 8-bit conversion will reduce the data resolution. Even though the recorded resolution is 12 bits, choosing the option to \"Preserve 16-bit\" will retain the original resolution.\n\nOptions\n\nOCS Guidelines\n\nKlein 3000 Frequency - High or Low\nConvert Hidden\nPressure Sensor - 100, 300, or 1000 psi\n\nHigh frequency data should be used unless range scale requirements are such that the higher frequency is inefective.\nDo not convert hidden beams as a standard practice.\nChoose the pressure sensor rating for the specifc towfsh used to acquire data being converted.\n\n144\n\n\fConvert SSGyro\n\nDo not convert SSGyro\n\n16-bit Sonar Conversion\n\nChoose to \"Preserve 16-bit\"\n\n- Preserve 16-bit\n\nresolution.\n\n- Convert to 8-bit: Scale or Shif\n\nTable 4.5: OCS guidelines for converting SDF data.\n\n4.3.2.1.2 Simrad\n\nKongsberg Simrad multibeam systems, such as the EM1002 or EM3000, used for bathymetric data acquisition as discussed in section 4.2.3.1.2 , are also capable of recording backscatter data. Simrad backscatter imagery is not an acceptable object detection method for OCS hydrographic surveys. However, these backscatter data may be useful for verifying objects detected in bathymetry data or identifying changes in seafoor texture to guide bottom sampling operations.\n\nConverting Simrad angle-dependent backscatter imagery into HDCS fles is simple. When converting the Simrad bathymetry data in HIPS, the user simply makes a choice whether or not to \"Convert Side Scan/Backscatter\" data. No other choices are associated with imagery conversion.\n\nOptions\n\nOCS Guidelines\n\nConvert Side Scan / Backscatter\n\nChoose this option and convert imagery data.\n\nTable 4.6: OCS guidelines for converting Simrad data.\n\n4.3.2.1.3 Extended Triton Format (XTF)\n\nTe eXtended Triton Format (XTF) can be used to store data from a variety of side scan systems. Both imagery and bathymetry data from MBES systems can also be acquired in the XTF format (although this is uncommon on NOAA hydrographic feld units), and the same CARIS XTF converter is used for all three data types. XTF datagrams are comprised of a Triton-defned \"header\" attached to an optional manufacturer-specifc sensor data packet.\n\nNOAA hydrographic feld units acquiring SSS data with a Klein 5000 dynamically focused multibeam side scan sonar will typically log data in XTF format. Since the CARIS converter accommodates an extensive variety of sonar systems capable of logging XTF data, the user is required to make multiple decisions so that this raw sonar data is properly interpreted by CARIS. Each critical conversion choice is discussed below, with OCS guidance summarized in section 4.3.2.1.3.2 .\n\n4.3.2.1.3.1 Convert Side Scan\nSome SSS systems, such as the Klein 3000, will simultaneously log data from multiple frequencies. During conversion, each frequency will be associated with a pair of sonar channels and the user must indicate which channels are to be processed. If the SSS operates on only one frequency, the data will always be associated with sonar channels 1 and 2.\nNavigation data can be recorded in two separate datafelds (\"ship\" navigation and \"sensor\" navigation) within the XTF side scan datagram. Te primary diference between the \"ship\" and \"sensor\" felds is how the data is time stamped. \"Ship\" navigation is associated with the time logged in the XTF header, while each \"sensor\" navigation string is individually time stamped. Applying \"Sensor\" navigation is recommended to avoid potential timing errors.\n145\n\n\fHeading (gyro) data can not only be logged in multiple datagrams within the XTF record, but may also be recorded in multiple locations within the side scan datagram. While this sensor data may appear redundant, sources and data quality can vary. Typically, NOAA hydrographic feld units will apply heading data stored in the \"ship\" feld of the side scan datagram, which will correspond to the vessel's instantaneous heading. Heading data from the attitude packet will also correspond to the vessel's instantaneous heading, but the logging rate for attitude data is ofen set much higher than the update rate for heading. Tus, using attitude packet heading data will be efective but could be considered \"overkill\". If vessel crab angle is large and the SSS is being towed, the hydrographer should remember that a towed body will not be experiencing the same crabbing efect. In this scenario, course-madegood (CMG) from navigation ofen provides the best imagery. Tis option uses an interpolated heading value based on recorded vessel position fxes. If acceptable towfsh navigation was logged, \"CMG from SSSNavigation\" should provide similar results. OCS does not recommend using heading data from the \"sensor\" feld. Tis data is logged from the towfsh's magnetic compass, which is subject to both magnetic variation and electrical interference.\nIf data were acquired using a Klein 5000 dynamically focused multibeam side scan sonar, the user must choose whether or not to convert hidden beams. Tere are fve beams on each channel (port and starboard) of the Klein 5000. Based on range scale and towfsh speed, the system will determine the number of beams necessary to achieve 100% coverage. Typical range scales and speeds used for hydrographic surveying require that 3 - 4 beams be used. Selecting \"convert hidden\" forces all 5 beams to be converted and may improve imagery in high yaw-rate conditions (e.g., in turns or for hull-mount confgurations) or aid in detection of very small objects during activities such as search and recovery. However, for the purposes of a basic OCS hydrographic survey, converting hidden beams is not necessary to meet survey specifcations and can introduce data management problems by signifcantly increasing fle sizes.\nVarious side scan sonar systems may record imagery at diferent resolutions. Both Klein System 3000 and System 5000 imagery data are recorded at a resolution of 12 bits. When converting XTF fles, choosing an 8-bit conversion will reduce the data resolution. Even though the recorded resolution is 12 bits, choosing the option to \"Preserve 16-bit\" will retain the original resolution.\n4.3.2.1.3.2 Convert Layback/CableOut Data\nNOAA hydrographic feld units typically record cable out during towed SSS acquisition to facilitate recomputing navigation, if necessary. Te XTF format provides two datafelds (\"cableout\" and \"layback\") in which this information can be stored. Te primary diference in these felds is that \"cableout\" will only accept integers, while a decimal number can be logged in the \"layback\" feld. To preserve decimeter accuracy for cable out values, the feld unit may use one of the two following options:\n\u00b7 Confgure the vessel's cable counter to output values in decimeters and log an integer value to the \"cableout\" feld. However, SIPS assumes cable out data is in meters when recomputing. During conversion, the user can enter a \"multiplier\" of 0.1 to the \"cableout\" data that would reconvert the values to meters. For example, if acquiring SSS data with 10.6 meters of cable out, a cable counter integer output of 106 (decimeters) would be stored in the XTF \"cableout\" feld. When converting the data in SIPS, the \"cableout\" value would be multiplied by 0.1 to recreate a value of 10.6 that SIPS assumes is in meters.\n\u00b7 Confgure the acquisition system to log cable out, in meters and decimal meters, to the XTF \"layback\" feld. In this scenario, the user must remember to convert data from the \"layback\" feld, even though the data are actually values for cable out. SIPS will assume data from either datafeld is cable out if towfsh sensor depths are non-zero. (Similarly, if no towfsh depths are converted, SIPS will interpret this as a zero sensor depth and assume data from either datafeld are layback values.)\n146\n\n\fTo determine towfsh depth, both the Klein 3000 and Klein 5000 SSS systems calculate a value from an integrated pressure sensor. If the hydrographer intends to use cable out to recompute navigation for a SSS system that does not have a pressure sensor, the towfsh depth will need to be calculated based on water depth logged to an AUX feld and towfsh altitude. Typically, NOAA hydrographic feld units will not need to calculate a sensor depth in this fashion.\n\nOptions Convert Side Scan - Sonar channels (1,2 or 3,4)\n- Navigation Datafeld (ship or sensor)\n- Gyro Datafeld (ship, sensor, attitude packet, CMG from navigation, CMG from [sss] navigation)\n- Convert Hidden Data\n\nOCS Guidelines\nFor single frequency systems, convert channels 1 and 2. When using multiple frequency systems, the user must determine which channel pair corresponds to the frequency they wish to convert. Use navigation data stored in the \"sensor\" datafeld to avoid potential timing problems. Typically, use heading data from the \"ship\" datafeld. If vessel crab angle is large, CMG may provide better imagery. Do not apply heading from the \"sensor\" datafeld\nDo not convert hidden beams as a standard practice.\n\n- Apply image enhancement\n- Convert single beam from AUX feld num\n- 16 bit sonar conversion (preserve 16 bit, convert to 8 bit (scale or shif)) Convert Layback/CableOut data - From layback feld - From cableout feld (multiplier)\n- Calculate sensor depth using AUX feld\n\nDo not apply image enhancement as a standard practice.\nLogging VBES data to an AUX feld is not recommended. Tus, this option is not checked as a standard practice.\nChoose to \"Preserve 16-bit\" resolution.\nConvert cable out data from either feld, depending upon the acquisition system confguration. If converting from the Cableout feld, apply a multiplier to preserve decimeter accuracy. Tis option is necessary only if recomputing navigation for a system that does not have a pressure sensor.\n\n4.3.2.2 Filter\n\nSIPS does not provide fltering tools to automatically fag/reject \"bad\" imagery data. However, as when processing bathymetry, fltering can be performed on attitude and navigation data. Refer to sections 4.2.4.3.3 and 4.2.4.3.4 for details on Attitude Editor and Navigation Editor. Time-series data for gyro (heading), cable out, and sensor depth, as well as bottom tracking must be reviewed line-by-line and edited as necessary. If the SSS system is confgured to calculate sensor depth based on sensor height and an auxiliary VBES depth, these sensors will also need to be reviewed.\n\n4.3.2.3 Recompute Towfsh Navigation\nOCS typically uses one of two side scan sonar confgurations, a towed sonar body or a hull-mounted sonar body. Regardless of system confguration, the hydrographer has the option of either computing the sensor position\n147\n\n\fduring data acquisition or recomputing towfsh navigation during SIPS processing. If a towfsh position is computed during acquisition and stored in the raw data format, this information can be converted directly into the SIPS towfsh navigation data structure. If, in addition to ship navigation, either cable out and towfsh depth or horizontal layback is recorded, the side scan sensor position can be calculated in SIPS via Recompute Towfsh Navigation. OCS strongly recommends recomputing towfsh navigation using cable out and towfsh depth to determine towed sensor position. Tis process enables the hydrographer to review and edit, if necessary, the ship position data, cable counter data, and towfsh depth or bottom tracking (if used to determine towfsh depth) prior to calculating a towfsh position.\nNote: If horizontal layback or tow cable length data are not available or if the Recompute Towfsh Navigation step is not executed, then the towfsh navigation data recorded during acquisition will be used to georeference imagery. If, additionally, towfsh navigation was not recorded during data acquisition, then the side scan sensor position data are assumed to be the same as the ship navigation data.\nWhen using a hull-mounted confguration, navigation data for the sensor is typically determined by using ship navigation data and entering the vessel RP-to-towfsh ofset in the towpoint section of the HVF. However, SIPS will only apply the towpoint ofset when navigation is recomputed. For this type of confguration, Recompute Towfsh Navigation must be performed with a cable out value of zero.\nNote: If no cable out data was converted, SIPS will assume cable out to be zero.\n4.3.2.4 Slant Range Correction\nSide scan sonar is initially logged as a series of time-indexed intensity values for each ping, i.e., the acrosstrack axis represents time. Tese data are considered \"raw\" side scan and are displayed with the central portion of the image representing the water column and a digital line along either the port or starboard leading edge indicating the logged bottom track. Some sonar systems will track bottom very accurately, while others require that these data be edited or redigitized. Any errors in bottom track should be edited prior to slant range correcting, as these data determine sonar height during the slant range correction process.\nWhen data are slant range corrected, an estimate of the speed of sound through sea water is applied to the two-way travel time for each intensity value. Tis produces an estimated ray length that, when combined with the known sonar height (from the digitized or logged bottom), is used to produce the acrosstrack distance to a pixel using simple trigonometry. Slant range corrected data are displayed with the water column removed and the acrosstrack scale representing distance from nadir. It should be noted that this method presupposes that the bottom is fat across the ping and can result in the acrosstrack misplacement of objects over varied or steeply sloping terrain. If available, SIPS can use a BASE Surface, grid, or tile in the slant range correction operation to supply depth values and improve the acrosstrack positioning of pixels. Tis process is explained in detail in the CARIS HIPS and SIPS User's Manual.\nDuring the process of slant range correction, the resolution value will default to the minimum value appropriate for the sonar system. If this resolution is not feasible, it will default to 0.10 meters. Resolution may be manually increased, but keep in mind that increased resolution means a larger fle size. Te hydrographer will be required to make some arbitrary decisions regarding beam pattern correction and despeckling. Te \"Beam Pattern\" function attempts to equalize the diferences in pixel intensity from nadir to the outer ranges of the sonar swath. Te \"Despeckle\" function detects isolated bright spots and streaks in the raw sonar fle and smooths them by averaging the neighboring pixels. Applying these options will produce a more attractive mosaic when creating constituent products, and should not hide small contacts during data processing. If SSS data were converted using the \"Preserve 16-bit\" option, the user can choose to \"Create 8-Bit Processed Side Scan\" to generate a slant range fle requiring less\n148\n\n\fstorage space, if necessary. When slant-range correcting 16-bit data to create 8-bit side scan, a shif factor should be applied to spread out the histogram and improve imagery. Te user can apply either the 16-bit shif factor stored with each line or a single bit shif factor to be applied to all lines. Generally, the bit shif factor stored with each line is a good choice.\n4.3.2.5 Add to Mosaic\nA survey-wide side scan mosaic should be created and maintained during Daily Batch Processing to evaluate data coverage, identify any gross systematic errors, and plan future data acquisition.\nNote: If a 200% side scan survey is being conducted, a separate mosaic should be created to demonstrate coverage for each hundred percent.\nIn addition to planning future SSS acquisition, the frst 100% mosaic can be used to delineate areas of high contact density where complete MBES coverage is more appropriate than 200% SSS. Te hydrographer is reminded that AWOIS radii that extend beyond the basic survey limits must be entirely covered with 200% side scan, complete or object detection multibeam, or a combination thereof to be disproved by sonar data. Tese radii should be considered when evaluating survey coverage.\nWhen creating a mosaic, the hydrographer will be prompted for several pieces of information. In accordance with section 5.2.2 of the HSSD, resolution shall be 1m by 1m or less. Maximum acrosstrack and altitude ratios can be used to systematically remove areas of poor quality data from the mosaic, such as when outer edges are afected by thermocline. Note: Tese features will not actually reject the imagery data, but they will remove portions indicated for all lines in the mosaic.\nOptions such as interpolation and shine-thru may be used at the hydrographer's discretion. Tese features may enhance the overall mosaic and can be desirable for creating constituent products.\n4.3.3 Boat-day Processing\nBoat-day Processing\" as described in this chapter refers to that portion of the hydrographic data processing that is performed on a single vessel's data that were acquired during a single day of data acquisition. It is assumed that all the processes described in section 4.3.2 of this chapter have already been performed. For ships and launches, this portion of the processing is typically accomplished during the \"night processing\" shif. For feld parties, this processing step may be either saved for foul weather days or accomplished by a shore party member in charge of their unit's daily data processing.\nTe goal of imagery Boat-day Processing is to identify contacts that warrant further investigation and record these contacts in the digital data. Tis process is completed using SIPS Side Scan Editor.\n4.3.3.1 Side Scan Editor\nImagery data should be reviewed twice using CARIS SIPS Side Scan Editor. Te initial review process is referred to as \"scanning\" the data. Te second review is performed by a diferent person and is called \"check scanning.\" Te initial reviewer should identify any object that warrants further investigation, ofen referred to as a \"signifcant contact\", and record these items into the digital data. Te second review serves as a quality control, and should add any signifcant contacts that were overlooked during the initial check. SIPS provides several tools to assist in determining if a contact is signifcant. Two of the most frequently used are \"Measure Shadow\" and \"Measure Distance.\"\n149\n\n\f\"Measure Shadow\" can be used to determine the height of an object by measuring its acoustic shadow and calculating the object's approximate elevation of the seafoor. Tis tool can only be used when viewing data in slant range corrected mode. \"Measure Distance\" is used to measure the distance between two points. Tis tool is helpful in determining the overall size of contacts, which may determine signifcance. For example, a very large item, even if it does not protrude signifcantly from the seafoor, may be listed in the AWOIS database and should therefore be investigated. Te Measure Distance tool can be used when viewing both \"raw\" (i.e., not slant range corrected) and slant range corrected data.\nAll signifcant contacts should be recorded in the digital data by creating a contact in SIPS. (Refer to the CARIS HIPS and SIPS Users Guide for detailed information on how to create a contact.) Te general OCS practice for determining signifcance of an imagery contact is stated in the HSSD.\nTe hydrographer must always consider the location of a contact when determining signifcance. For example, in a major channel where vessels transit with minimal underkeel clearance, a contact less than one meter high could be signifcant.\nWhen a contact is recorded in SIPS, the item is geo-coded and attributes are attached to it in the Side Scan Editor. Each contact should be attributed as thoroughly as possible. A contact fle is created for each survey line and is stored in the line folder within the Project directory structure.\n4.3.4 Survey-wide Processing\n\"Survey-wide Processing\" for imagery data consists of evaluating total coverage and assessing side scan contacts in NOAA's Pydro sofware to determine which items warrant further investigation or development, and attributing each contact accordingly in Pydro. Efciency can be increased by conducting many of the survey-wide processing steps concurrently with Boat-day processing for global quality control and general survey completeness. Tese processes would include verifying adequate investigation of charted features and assigned AWOIS items within (or partially within) the survey sheet limits, reviewing the data for Dangers to Navigation (DTONs), and verifying that data coverage meets the assigned specifcations. Reviewing these points on a daily basis will help to ensure a complete survey and a timely submission.\n4.3.4.1 Review Survey-wide Mosaic\nSurvey-wide mosaics are typically reviewed during Boat-day processing to assess coverage and insure that no signifcant data gaps, referred to as \"holidays,\" are present in the imagery. Once 100% side scan coverage has been attained and demonstrated via the survey-wide mosaic, this \"fnal mosaic\" should be saved as a CARIS Fieldsheet and exported as a GeoTif in UTM NAD 83 format. Both the Fieldsheet and GeoTif image should be digitally fled for submission with the completed survey data. If the survey requires 200% side scan coverage, a separate fnal mosaic should be created for each hundred percent.\n4.3.4.2 Assess Imagery Features\nTroughout the survey process, imagery contacts should be periodically assessed and a determination made as to whether \"development\" is necessary. Developing an imagery contact typically refers to investigating the item with MBES to determine a least depth. However, other methods of obtaining a least depth may be used, such as VBES or DLDG. Some types of side scan sonar systems are able to acquire co-located imagery and bathymetry data. However, these systems are a developing technology, and SSS bathymetry has not yet been approved for OCS hydrographic surveys.\n150\n\n\fImagery contacts should be assessed using either CARIS Notebook or Pydro, which enables the hydrographer to analyze each contact in context with other available data sources such as correlating contacts, the chart, bathymetry, DPs, and AWOIS records/search radii. Contacts should be evaluated and, if confrmed to be signifcant, fagged for \"investigation\" within Pydro. Tis fag enables the user to export that item to MapInfo MIF/MID and HYPACK TGT formats to plan for further investigation or development. (Once a contact has been exported, its Pydro record will indicate this via the \"Tgt Exported\" fag.) If correlating contacts or features exist, the image which best represents the contact should be fagged \"Primary\", and all correlating contacts, AWOIS items, or charted features should be fagged \"Secondary\".\nNote: Any signifcant contact suspected to be a Danger to Navigation, as described in section 4.4.2.1 , shall be expedited through the investigation/development process and a DTON report submitted, if necessary.\nContacts which, upon further analysis, are determined not to be signifcant should be fagged \"Resolved\" and a note added to the Remarks tab of the Editor's Notebook stating that the item is considered insignifcant. Any contact which was erroneously inserted into the survey data, and can not be efciently removed, should be fagged \"Rejected\" and an explanation entered in the Remarks tab. For additional information on analyzing and fagging contacts in Pydro, refer to section 4.4\nTe determination whether or not to develop an item from imagery data is considered a preliminary assessment of contacts. Once this decision has been made, signifcant contacts are considered imagery \"features\" and should be further processed as described in section 4.4 Tis preliminary contact evaluation should not be confused with fnalization of imagery data, where the goal is to verify that all contacts have been addressed and fagged either \"resolved\" or \"rejected.\"\n4.3.4.3 Finalize Imagery Survey Data\nOnce all signifcant contacts have been developed, analyzed, and fagged in accordance with section 4.4 the hydrographer should verify that no \"Unresolved\" imagery features remain in the Pydro PSS and a fnal mosaic, created in accordance with section 8.3.1 of the HSSD, has been generated and digitally fled for each 100% SSS data acquired.\n4.4 Feature Processing and Analysis\nIn OCS surveys, a feature is an object that merits individual attention distinct from the bathymetric model of the sea foor.\nIn a general sense, the bathymetric model of the sea foor will be represented on the chart using soundings and contoured depth areas. Everything else: buoys, rocks, wrecks, piles, docks, etc. are features. During the acquisition of a hydrographic survey, the hydrographer will encounter many objects that may merit individual attention and treatment.\nIn some cases, this object will be of signifcant navigational interest and will eventually be portrayed as a distinct cartographic symbol on a chart. An example of this type of feature is a prominent wreck. Once discovered, the wreck will likely require further investigation. Tis may involve high resolution multibeam, side scan sonar, or diver investigation. Tis additional information is collected together and used to fully describe and categorize the wreck. Once processed, this information is passed to the Atlantic and Pacifc Hydrographic branches and cartographers using formatted reports and digital data fles. Tese data will aid the cartographer in correctly charting the feature.\n151\n\n\fIn other cases, further investigation may indicate that the feature is not navigationally signifcant, and should not be charted as a distinct cartographic symbol. An example of this type of feature might be an object detected with side scan sonar that subsequent multibeam coverage found to be not of navigational concern (a patch of gravel perhaps). Tis feature would still be handled through the same methods as the wreck described above. Tis process serves as a record that the hydrographer properly inspected and handled all indications of an item of potential navigational signifcance.\nIn some other cases, the hydrographer may wish to call out an object for individual cartographic treatment even if the depth of the object is well represented in the bathymetric data set. For example, a large glacial erratic boulder on an otherwise fat and featureless sandy bottom may be of particular navigational signifcance, especially if there is a bottom trawl fshing feet in the area. Tis object may be selected by the hydrographer and recommended for charting as an isolated feature rather than simply through soundings and contours.\nWe can see from these examples that the feature processing pipeline is used to: (1) gather together information on features that may eventually be added to the chart, (2) aid in assessing the feature's navigational signifcance, and (3) provide a mechanism for reporting this feature analysis to the Atlantic and Pacifc Hydrographic branches.\nFive basic sources of feature information must be analyzed and resolved when processing an OCS hydrographic survey: Bathymetry, side scan imagery, detached positions (DPs), AWOIS items, and geographic positions (GPs). Te ability to resolve a feature depends heavily on viewing data in its full context. GIS (Geographic Information System) sofware can be used to spatially correlate a set of features both within the contemporary survey data and from other (prior) data sources, enabling the hydrographer to quickly identify redundant data on a single \"real world\" feature. Correlating information allows the hydrographer to confdently determine a feature's signifcance with respect to marine safety and nautical charting. Te most important features that can be identifed in a survey are those that pose a danger to navigation (DTON). Data should be reviewed daily to identify items that are DTONs, as described in section 4.4.2.1 DTON processing shall be expedited to the greatest extent possible.\nNon-DTON features should be evaluated and classifed periodically as the survey progresses toward completion. Ultimately, all features should be evaluated, classifed, developed (if necessary), and resolved.\nNOAA hydrographic feld units shall use NOAA's Pydro sofware package, CARIS Notebook, CARIS Bathy DataBASE (BDB), and/or HYPACK ENC EDITOR to analyze and document survey features. CARIS BDB and Pydro are generally used for feature correlation for side scan sonar (SSS) contacts. Pydro is also used for generating survey reports for DTONS and the Final Request for Tides. All four sofware packages can be used to process S-57 features and populate their attributes. Te user may switch between sofware by importing and exporting S-57 .000 fles. Te capabilities of these sofware packages are described further in section 4.4.1.\nTe feature processing workfow is illustrated in fgure 4.17.below:\n152\n\n\f4.4.1 Processing Sofware\n\nFigure 4.17: Feature Processing Workfow\n\n4.4.1.1 NOAA Pydro Sofware\n\nNOAA's Pydro sofware package is used to bring the various source data for potential features, (side scan Sonar contacts, designated soundings, detached positions etc.) together in a georeferenced interface. In most cases, Pydro maintains links to the source data which results in certain fags and edits applied in Pydro being automatically written into the source dataset. Similarly, some types of editing performed in the raw data processing program (i.e., CARIS HIPS/SIPS) will be automatically carried through to Pydro.\n\nNote: Some edits performed in CARIS, such as rejecting/accepting sounding data or imagery contacts, will require that the source data be re-inserted into Pydro.\n\n\u00b7 Pydro has the ability to read several data types, including the following:\n\n\u00b7 Side scan imagery contacts created in CARIS SIPS.\n\n\u00b7 Bathymetry features in CARIS HIPS; i.e., soundings fagged \"outstanding\" and/or \"designated\".\n\n\u00b7 Bathymetry soundings in CARIS HIPS; shoal-biased binned line-by-line.\n\n\u00b7 Gridded bathymetry data created in CARIS HIPS; BASE surfaces (.csar) or weighted grids (.def/.sum/. weight) fles.\n\n\u00b7 Target fles from HYPACK (.tgt), Trimble Pathfnder (.mdb, etc.), and other generic data sources.\n\n\u00b7 Te AWOIS database, in MS Access format.\n\n153\n\n\f\u00b7 ENC (.000 fles).\n\u00b7 Other \"generic\" geographic position data in many database formats, such as ESRI Shapefles (.shp), MapInfo Interchange Files (MIF/MID), MS Excel, dBase (.dbf), ASCII, etc.\n\u00b7 ENC S-57 base cells (.000) rendered according to S-52 and various raster formats for background data, including GeoTIFF (.tif), MrSID (.sdf), and NOAA/BSB raster nautical charts (.kap)\n\u00b7 Once these data are imported into Pydro for a specifc survey, the combined data package is referred to as a Pydro Survey Session (PSS).\nNote: Te Pydro PSS is not to be confused with the historical \"preliminary smooth sheet\", which was a plotted presentation of survey data formerly required for submission.\nWithin the PSS, items can be marked with digital notes, various fags, and attributes to aid in decision making and reporting. Items are automatically correlated according to a user-specifed radius or can be manually recorrelated and grouped to form sets of observations that represent the same physical item. Te best data for reporting a feature, e.g., the most accurate least depth observation from the available bathymetry and/or most descriptive picture from the available imagery, is designated via a defned fagging schema.\nPydro is also the mechanism for creating reports such as DTONs and Requests for Tides. Tese reports are automatically generated from the digital data which eliminates error prone \"cut and paste\" actions and standardizes report formats which maintains quality control throughout the hydrographic data pipeline.\nPSS fles from Pydro are interoperable with CARIS Notebook, BDB, and HYPACK by importing and exporting S-57 .000 fles.\n4.4.1.2 CARIS Sofware\nCARIS Notebook and Bathy DataBASE (BDB) are used to bring together various data types, including features, images and bathymetry into a georeferenced user interface. CARIS Notebook and BDB are good tools for managing line and area features such as reefs, foul areas, piers etc. Notebook also has GPS logging and tide correction capabilities for point features. Te GPS logging enables the user to digitize point and line features from a launch or backpack in real time. Te tide correction enables the user to tide correct all features in Notebook instead of HIPS & SIPS.\nNotebook and BDB have the ability to read several data types, including the following:\n\u00b7 ENCs, or other S-57 databases (.hob, .000)\n\u00b7 Raster displays: (.kap, .tif)\n\u00b7 Vector fles (.shp, .dxf, .des)\n\u00b7 Gridded CARIS Surfaces (.csar)\n154\n\n\f\u00b7 Pydro .000 fles \u00b7 Pydro XML fles (Notebook only) \u00b7 CARIS Mosaics \u00b7 CARIS Contours \u00b7 CARIS Sounding Plots Once these data are imported into Notebook or BDB for a specifc survey, they are saved into a Notebook or Bathy DataBASE session, which can be opened as a cohesive unit. Within each Session, there can be numerous types of information to assist in processing and analyzing potential features. Charts, georeferenced images, CARIS HIPS and SIPS generated data products etc. assist in feature analysis while the features themselves are housed in non-standard .000 fles called HOB fles. Each feature within a HOB fle follows the S-57 encoding specifcations and has extended attributes to provide further fexibility in processing and to support data interoperability between the various workfows that may be used in the feld. HOB fles from CARIS Notebook and BDB are interoperable with Pydro and HYPACK by importing and exporting S-57 .000 fles.\n4.4.1.3 HYPACK Sofware HYPACK contains a module that is embedded into the main HYPACK Shell called HYPACK ENC Editor. Tis sofware is capable of making direct edits to the S-57 .000 fle and takes advantage of the NOAA extended attributes to support data interoperability between the various workfows that may be used in the feld. Te feld may utilize this option to perform feature verifcation in the feld as well as adding new features to the .000 fle (similar to Notebook's GPS logging function). Edits in the extended attribution are retained in the .000 fle. HYPACK target fles (tgt) acquired as features can also be imported into ENC Editor and translated into S-57 objects. HYPACK ENC Editor has the ability to read several data types, including the following: ENCs (.000) Raster displays: (.kap, .tif) Vector fles (.shp, .dxf, .dgn, .tgt) S-57 .000 fles from HYPACK are interoperable with Pydro and CARIS by importing and exporting S-57 .000 fles.\n155\n\n\f4.4.2 Signifcant Features\n4.4.2.1 Dangers to Navigation (DTONs)\nTe most important features to identify in a survey are Dangers to Navigation (DTON). A DTON is defned as any uncharted or incorrectly charted natural feature (e.g., shoal, boulder, reef, rock outcropping) or cultural feature (e.g., wreck, obstruction, pile, wellhead) that poses an immediate threat to surface navigation. General chart discrepancies can be addressed at the conclusion of a survey, but items that meet DTON criteria should be reported as soon as practicable afer discovery.\nTe primary characteristic of a DTON is navigational signifcance. When reviewing survey data for potential DTONs, the hydrographer must consider the types of vessels operating in the area as well as vessel routes, both typical and seasonal. Much of the fnal selection of DTONs is subjective and requires a bit of cartographic interpretation as well as a navigational perspective of the chart. Examination of newly acquired survey data for potential DTONs should be performed on a daily basis.\nTe following guidelines can be used to identify potential DTONs; however, each item should be further evaluated for signifcance within that specifc geographical area.\n4.4.2.1.1 Water Depth\nHistorically, selection of DTONs has been concentrated in areas with water depths of 20 meters or less. While this remains a good rule of thumb, this depth range should be evaluated in the context of vessel trafc and typical routes through the area. For example, features in water deeper than 20 meters may be DTONs along routes for supertankers.\n4.4.2.1.2 Potential DTON Height\nTypically, survey features and soundings indicating a depth discrepancy of 1 meter or greater are frst evaluated for DTON potential. Again, this guideline should not be followed blindly. Vessel trafc must be considered. If vessels transit the area with minimal underkeel clearance, a discrepancy of only 1/3 meter could be critical; or, if a deep inland bay or harbor is accessible only by shoaler restricted channels, a large feature within the deep water area may not be a hazard since only small vessels could access the area. Figure 4.18 illustrates a potential DTON located within a channel. If the channel's tabulated depth is listed as 40 feet for the right outside quarter, then this charting discrepancy would only be 1 foot. Typically, a 1-foot discrepancy would not be considered a DTON. However, the hydrographer must consider what type of vessels transit the area and how much water they draw. Tis channel might be the entrance to a major port facility where vessels drawing 40 feet arrive on the rising tide. In such a case, this 1-foot diference is critical, particularly if the item is a rock or cultural feature as opposed to a sandy shoal.\nFigure 4.19 shows a small bay with depth discrepancies of 2 fathoms (12 feet). Although this depth difference is significant, the bay is accessible only by passing through a 5 or 6 fathom channel. Thus, the 7 fathom sounding inside the bay is insignificant, i.e., not a DTON. Similarly, a very large object identified in a river accessible only by small craft may not be a DTON. Figure 4.19 shows a potential DTON located in a deep section of a small river. The object in question protrudes over 10 meters from the seafloor. However, this river happens to be accessible only by small craft, due to a shoal at its mouth. Despite this large depth discrepancy, the item is navigationally insignificant when the hydrographer considers the draft of vessels capable of operating in the area.\n156\n\n\fFigure 4.18: Potential DTON in Channel\n\nFigure 4.19: Potential DTON in small bay\n\n4.4.2.1.3 Proximity to Existing Features\nMany new or uncharted features are potential DTONs. Te hydrographer must consider each new item's proximity to existing features (rocks, reefs, fsh havens, shoreline, foul areas, etc.) and the item's signifcance with respect to these adjacent features. Figure 4.20 illustrates a case where an existing feature (Fish Haven with an authorized minimum of 15 feet) afects the signifcance of a potential DTON. In this example, an item intended for the fsh haven may have been erroneously deposited outside the haven's geographical bounds, a very realistic scenario. Despite the discrepancy with regard to the charted 43 foot depth, the adjacent Fish Haven to the south/southwest and shoal to the east would deter prudent mariners from approaching the area. Likewise, a large depth discrepancy adjacent to a reef or foul area would quite possibly not be a DTON, again, as a prudent mariner would operate in the area only with extreme caution.\n\nFigure 4:20: Potential DTON adjacent to fsh\nhaven.\n4.4.2.1.4 Dense Groups of DTONs\nTe density of DTONs reported should not exceed what can be legibly portrayed on the largest scale chart of the area. If numerous DTON candidates are identifed in close proximity, the hydrographer could report either the most signifcant item or the group of DTONs as an area feature, e.g., designate the entire area \"foul.\" When determining the most signifcant DTON in a group, the item having the shoalest least depth will typically be chosen. However, this may not be the case if, for example, the item is located on a slope. Typically, if two potential DTON are adjacent on a slope, the most seaward sounding will be selected for submission. Te prudent mariner\n157\n\n\fwill assume that depths will decrease as shore is approached. An example of this exception is shown in Figure 4.21. Te 2 fathom sounding is shoaler, but the 4 fathom sounding extends further ofshore. In this case, the 4 fathom sounding would be submitted. Although both soundings would supersede the 5\u00be fathom charted depth, it can be reasonably inferred that there is a continuous slope toward shore, therefore depths shoaler than 4 fathoms would be expected.\nFigure 4.21: Two potential DTON's located on close\nproximity.\n4.4.2.1.5 Charted Feature Removal Request\nA Charted Feature Removal Request, ofen referred to as an \"anti-DTON,\" is used to expeditiously remove charted features that are hindering operations in major shipping corridors and have been adequately disproved. Only navigationally critical items should be submitted as Charted Feature Removal Requests. Tese requests should be submitted using the same procedure indicated for DTONs in this manual.\n4.4.2.1.6 DTON Submission (see section 8.1.3 of HSSD)\nTypically, DTON selections should be reviewed by the Chief-of-Party prior to submission. If approved, DTONs must be fagged properly in Pydro, which can then generate a DTON report. Note: All Pydro PSS Metadata should be completed prior to generating a DTON report so that this information will be included in the report. Additionally, the DTON must be stamped with the actual ping time and not the time they were discovered in boat or ofce processing. Te Pydro DTON report is generated in a Zip archive which contains an Adobe *.pdf text report, an *.xml fle containing the survey data for that feature, and a DTONImages folder containing all the relevant report images and chartlets (if applicable). Te Zip archive should be submitted to NOAA's Marine Chart Division (MCD) via email (ocs.ndb@noaa.gov), with courtesy copies to the Chief of OPS and to the Chief of the appropriate hydrographic branch.\nChartlets are not a required deliverable. However if applicable, feld units may use either Pydro or ESRI to generate a chartlet for the DTON report. If the chartlet is generated externally to Pydro, users must add those chartlets to the *.pdf report manually. Note: Te Pydro report includes a zip fle of the *.pdf so feld units must make sure the report to MCD is updated before submittal if the HydroMI chartlet is going to be used.\nAdditional actions, as noted below, are required when reporting DTONs in the following two cases.\n1. If the potential DTON will directly impact commercial shipping routes and/or is located within an area of Army Corps of Engineers' authority, the appropriate NOAA Navigation Manager shall be consulted prior to submitting the DTON. If the Nautical Data Branch of MCD discovers a DTON located in a Corps of Engineers' authority that has not been submitted to the Navigation Manager, then NDB personnel will cease processing the DTON and recommend that the submitting party inform the Navigation Manager. 158\n\n\f2. If a DTON report includes a potentially historically-signifcant wreck, the feld unit shall provide a courtesy copy of the report sections pertaining to that specifc feature to the corresponding NOAA Navigation Manager and State Historic Preservation Ofcer. If a potentially historically-signifcant wreck is identifed outside of state waters, notify the current Sanctuaries Historical/Archaeological contact.\nOnce submitted, all DTONs will be expedited through MCD to the Coast Guard for publication in the Local Notice to Mariners. Within three days of DTON report submission, MCD's Nautical Data Branch (NDB) will send an email to the feld unit confrming that DTON data has been received and processed. If a DTON submission is not confrmed by NDB within one week, the hydrographer should promptly contact MCD (via an inquiry email to ocs.ndb@noaa.gov) to verify that the report has been received and processed. MCD will also notify the submitting party of any changes made to the Dangers to Navigation Report by return e-mail. For additional reference and guidance, refer to section 8.1.3 Dangers to Navigation in the HSSD.\n4.4.2.2 AWOIS\nAutomated Wreck and Obstruction Information System is a database of wrecks and obstructions in the coastal waters of the United States. Tese items have been found during previous hydrographic surveys or have been reported by miscellaneous sources. Te HSD OPS Project Manager or the NRB Technical Assistant will assign AWOIS items to the feld unit for investigation. Te hydrographer shall investigate the items and document the results according to the AWOIS requirements. For further information on AWOIS see sections 7.3 of the H S S D and 2.2.2.2 of the FPM.\n4.4.2.3 Maritime Boundary Points\nOCS is responsible for depicting the Tree Nautical Mile Line (old territorial sea), Territorial Sea at 12 nautical miles, Contiguous Zone at 24 nautical miles, and Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) at 200 nautical miles on NOAA nautical charts. Tese maritime zones, defned by Maritime Boundary \"baseline points\", defne areas of U.S. jurisdiction for a variety of regulations. Te HSD OPS Project Manager or the NRB Technical Assistant will assign Maritime Boundary rocks to the feld unit for investigation. Te hydrographer shall investigate the items and document the results according to the Maritime Boundary requirements. For further information on Maritime Boundary see sections 7.3 of the HSSD and 3.5.6 of the FPM.\n4.4.2.4 Cultural or Historical Submerged Features\nIn the course of acquiring or processing hydrographic data, features on the seafoor may be discovered which are of potential cultural or historical signifcance. Tese include wrecks of ships or aircraf, the recognizable debris from wrecks, or other items which may appear anthropogenic in origin and have some associated cultural or historical signifcance.\nChiefs-of-Party must always promptly assess the discovery of any features for signifcance to local surface navigation and report these accordingly. Any feature determined to be a Danger to Navigation shall be immediately reported through the standard DTON reporting process (see section 4.4.2.1.\nIt is Marine Chart Division (MCD) policy that all features recommended for charting by the Chief-of-Party be applied to the appropriate nautical charts. Chiefs-of-Party must continue to recommend for charting all features determined to be signifcant to surface navigation, as well as features determined to be signifcant or hazardous to other marine chart users engaged in activities such as fshing or trawling. Tis includes features which may have\n159\n\n\fpotential cultural or historical signifcance. Tis policy is unchanged and in accordance with the MCD Nautical Charting Manual.\nAll features which appear to be of cultural or historical signifcance, and appear anthropogenic in origin, do require special consideration during the hydrographic surveying process. Data and information from these features must always be protected and may only be released in accordance with OCS policies and procedures. Unless specifed by the Project Instructions (or other written instructions from OCS):\n1. Do not attempt to determine the cultural or historic signifcance of any features. And, do not expend any operational efort toward identifcation beyond what is necessary for assessment as a Danger to Navigation.\n2. Do not speculate about a known or newly discovered feature's potential cultural or historical signifcance, either publicly or in writing.\n3. Do not identify by name or otherwise associate with a name, any cultural or historical feature in the Descriptive Report (DR) or any part of the survey's data.\n4. DO include an image, SSS or bathymetry, of the feature in the Pydro feature report for recognition by a historian or preservation ofcial.\nOCS, as a unit of a federal agency, has responsibilities under section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA, 16 U.S.C. 470 et seq.) to take into account the efects of its undertakings on historic properties. Te process for federal agencies in complying with the NHPA is laid out in 36 C.F.R. Part 800, which prescribes consultation with the State Historic Preservation Ofcer (SHPO). In addition, OCS may also consult with other NOAA ofces or governmental agencies.\nOCS consultations for hydrographic projects provide information about planned survey activities, and about survey outcomes. A pre- or post-survey consult will allow these Historic Preservation Points of Contact (HPPOCs) at least 30 days to respond. In general, NOAA feld units are not required to submit any data to a HPPOC. All consultations will be conducted by OCS.\n4.4.2.4.1 Pre-survey Consultation\nA pre-survey consult will be initiated during the project planning process by OCS HSD Operations Branch or NSD Navigation Response Branch. Any responses or special handling that may be required of a NOAA feld unit will be provided in the Project Instructions.\nA pre-survey consultation may be anticipated to result in one of three general outcomes:\n1. No Response \u00ad No special data handling is required.\n2. Informational response \u00ad Information received from the HPPOC is provided without any restriction for public release. No special data handling is required.\n3. Actionable response \u00ad Specifc information received from the HPPOC may prevent the public release of all or part of the survey data or products. Te specifc information will be evaluated by HSD OPS, and clear instructions for data handling will be provided will be provided in the PIs.\n160\n\n\f4.4.2.4.2 Post-survey Consultation\nA post-survey consult will be initiated by HSD's Atlantic Hydrographic Branch (AHB) or Pacifc Hydrographic Branch (PHB). No additional action should be required by the Field Unit.\n4.4.3 Survey Feature Management and Analysis\n4.4.3.1 Pre-acquisition\nHSD Operations provides the feld units with a Composite Source File (CSF) and Project Reference File (PRF) on the Project CD for feld verifcation. Te CSF is in a .000 format and consists of all of the source features (i.e. ENCs, Preliminary ENCs and GCs if applicable). Te hydrographer clips the project CSF to the size of the survey and this fle is renamed to Final Feature File where all updates occur. Te Final Feature File is one of the fnal deliverables to the processing branch.\nTe PRF is in a .000 format and consists of survey reference items such as: survey limits, investigations items (AWOIS and Maritime Boundary), bottom sample targets, and junction survey outlines. Te PRF is clipped to the size of the survey to support survey analysis and processing. Te PRF is for reference only and is not one of the fnal deliverables to the processing branch.\n4.4.3.2 Post-acquisition\n4.4.3.2.1. GPS Data Post-Processing\nAs described in section 3.5.3 , high accuracy GPS positioning frequently requires that the data acquired be post processed to apply all available corrections. Tis must be accomplished before the resulting feature positions are imported into the feature management environment for attribution and analysis. Most NOAA GPS post processing is accomplished by one of the following two methods.\n4.4.3.2.1.1 OPUS GPS Processing\nTe National Geodetic Survey's Online User Positioning Service (OPUS) is the most commonly used tool for postprocessing dual frequency GPS data for positions requiring sub-meter accuracy. OPUS allows the surveyor to submit GPS data fles in receiver-independent exchange (RINEX) format to NGS via the internet. Te data are post-processed, using NGS's PAGES sofware, with respect to three Continuously Operating Reference Stations (CORS). OPUS will try to select the three sites nearest to the user's location but will expand the search based on data availability and quality. Positions computed by OPUS are usually emailed to the user within a few minutes. Currently, OPUS can only process one position at a time, so multiple sessions must be submitted individually. A good solution will have an overall root mean square (RMS) value below 0.03m, using 90% of the observations, with over 50% of the ambiguities fxed.\nTe performance of precise orbits generally yields marginal improvements in accuracy than its rapid orbit counterpart. Terefore rapid orbits can be used extensively during time challenged surveys.\nAdditional information and specifc instructions for OPUS processing are included in the Users Guide for GPS Observations in Appendix 3 and on the OPUS web page http://geodesy.noaa.gov/OPUS/.\n161\n\n\f4.4.3.2.1.2 Tremble Pathfnder Ofce\nTrimble Pathfnder Ofce includes a Diferential Correction Utility which is used by many feld units equipped with the Trimble ProXRS backpack GPS receiver. Tis utility makes use of the carrier phase data logged by the ProXRS and the NGS CORS network to produce positions of meter-level accuracy or better.\n4.4.3.2.2 Target File Processing\nSeveral types of survey data, such as shoreline features, manually measured depths, and bottom samples, are positioned using target fles. Tese fles can not be read directly into CARIS; thus, Pydro has been developed to handle the bulk of target fle processing. A HYPACK target fle can be easily inserted into Pydro via Data > Insert > HYPACK DPs. Pydro's Data > Insert > Trimble/Pathfnder Database GPs+DPs imports a Microsof Access database (.mdb) according to a specifc, S-57 based Pathfnder data dictionary format developed in conjunction with NOAA Ship FAIRWEATHER. Separate tables are used in this Pathfnder database for separate S-57 object classes and geometry. For example, \"OBSTRN_P\", \"OBSTRN_L\", and \"OBSTRN_A\" tables may be present in a given database fle for point-, line-, and area-geometry obstructions acquired in the feld. And both GPs and DPs may be present in a given table; the \"Tide \u00ad DP/GP\" feld is used by Pydro to segregate those observational types. Other \"generic\" target fles can be read into Pydro via Data > Insert > Generic GPs/DPs, wherein users may confgure a template for importing other data sources on a routine basis. Once inserted into Pydro the DP observational data can be edited, and the various attributes present in Pydro are added. Pydro automatically writes or \"converts\" (in the same sense of the term used by CARIS HIPS) DP datasets to CARIS HDCS data during data save operations. See section 4.4.2.1 for more information.\nOnce a target fle is written to the HDCS data, it can be opened in CARIS to continue processing DPs which correspond to depths. In CARIS, a tide fle and, if necessary (i.e., for echosounder determined depths) a sound speed profle can be applied to DP data. Te DPs must then be merged as per standard HIPS processing to create processed depths. If any subsequent edits to DP position or depth values are performed in Pydro and saved, the standard CARIS HIPS \"outdated\" status is active and data will need to be re-SV Corrected and re-merged in HIPS.\n4.4.3.2.3 Water Level Correction (for features only)\nPreliminary and fnal water levels for tidally afected features such as rocks or piles are applied in either Pydro or CARIS Notebook. To apply tides in Pydro insert DPs and load appropriate tide fle (i.e. TCARI or Zoned). To apply tides in CARIS Notebook select the feature(s) and load appropriate tide fle (i.e. TCARI or Zoned).\n4.4.3.2.4 Attribution and Geometry\n4.4.3.2.4.1 S-57 Standard\nS 57 is shorthand for the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) Special Publication No. 57, \"IHO Transfer Standard for Digital Hydrographic Data\". S-57 standard details what S-57 objects and related attributes and geometry are permissible for ofcial navigational charts produced by hydrographic ofces around the world allowing hydrographic data to be transferred seamlessly from one user to another. Te primary fnal product of S-57 data within NOAA is the Electronic Navigational Chart (ENC).\nAn S-57 fle is a database of feature object classes and associated attributes that utilize a 6-letter acronym naming convention. For example a buoy (BOYLAT) is the feature object class and the description such as color (COLOUR)\n162\n\n\fare the associated attributes. Multiple object class \"instances\" are ofen required to describe a single real-world feature. For example, a lighted lateral buoy with a horn is described with three object classes in S-57: BOYLAT (buoy, lateral), LIGHTS (lights), and FOGSIG (fog signal).\nAttribute types under each object class are used to indicate the specifc makeup of the feature; e.g., COLOUR (colors), COLPAT (color pattern; applicable if dealing with more than one color), CATFOG (category of fog signal), etc.\n4.4.3.2.4.1.1 S-57 Objects\nS-57 feature designation and attribution are assigned in HYPACK, CARIS Notebook and BDB through the feature editing function. In CARIS select the feature type (i.e. point, line, area) on the Feature Creation menu. Select the appropriate feature object class in the Object Acronym list. Te details of the object class are displayed below in the Dictionary Information. Te S-57 attributes are in upper case, the extended attributes are in lower case, and the mandatory attributes are distinguished with red color (Note: this is only true if the hydrographer is using the NOAA customized extended attribute fles for CARIS which include the mandatory attribute settings). Certain attributes do not require manual editing; instead, the attribute is linked to the digital data present in the CARIS feature data (e.g. VALSOU - value of sounding - is associated with the depth).\nIn HYPACK select the feature type (i.e. node, chain, and region) and appropriate feature object class. Te HYPACK Object Catalog uses whole words instead of acronyms (e.g. to create a PILPNT, you select PILE). Te S-57 mandatory attributes are distinguished with a \"M\".\nIn Pydro S-57 features are designated and attributed via an S-57 Editor dialog. Only the primary item requires fags and attributes because they are propagated through to the fags of all Secondary items. Select an object in the \"Object Classes\" list by checking the box adjacent to the desired object class description. Te corresponding 6-digit acronym for any highlighted class name in the list is shown in the mouse pointer tooltip while hovering over the \"Object Classes\" button; and, clicking on the button opens up a help fle detailing the meaning of the object class. Te mandatory and additional attributes per the ENC Product Specifcation are shown on separate notebook pages in the Pydro S-57 Editor. Certain attributes do not require manual editing; instead, the attribute is linked to the digital data present in the Pydro XML feature data (manual editing for such attributes is in fact disabled). For example, if the S-57 attribute VALSOU (value of sounding) is associated with the feature, the Pydro XML <depth> element value will automatically appear in the depth editing box. Fill out the other boxes on the Additional Attributes notebook page in the S-57 Editor dialog according to your feld observation.\n4.4.3.2.4.1.2 S-57 Attribution\nS-57 feature attribution is required for features to be compiled to an ENC. S- 57 feature attribution is required for all new and updated items that represent a real-world feature recommendation for inclusion on the ofcial navigational chart. Te hydrographer should edit the S 57 object/attribute instances to describe each real world feature as completely as possible.\nIn addition to S-57 Attribution, NOAA requires customized fags and attribution to support H-Cell (preliminary ENC) compilation by the cartographers and to highlight features that need to be included in the appropriate reports. Tese extended attributes and fags are mirrored through all three processing sofware applications allowing for interoperability between the sofware using .000 fles.\nRefer to the S-57 and NOAA Attribution Guidance.pdf, Attributing and Flagging for Automated Feature Reports. pdf, and Customized Attribute Equivalencies.pdf in Appendix 4 of the FPM for more information.\n163\n\n\f4.4.3.2.4.2 New Features and Feature Geometry Modification\nThe most appropriate tools for creating and modifying line and area features are CARIS Notebook, BDB, and HYPACK ENC Editor. Notebook and HYPACK ENC Editor have the ability to digitize data in real time with the GPS logging functionality. Features can also be created or modified during post processing. BDB updates must occur during post processing as BDB does not have the GPS logging functionality.\nNew features are added as S-57 attributed objects through the feature editing function. The feature geometry shape and extents of existing features), such as ledges, foul areas etc, can also be modified using the same function. Line or area objects that require modification may be delivered as points or lines of the new extents.\nAll additions and modifications require specific attributes which are described in detail in the S-57 and NOAA Attribution Guidance.pdf in Appendix 4section 8.2 of the HSSD.\nAll new and modified features.are submitted in the Final Feature file. See section 4.4.4 for details.\n4.4.3.2.4.3 Attributing and Flagging\nFeatures must be attributed/flagged correctly in the processing software for the processing branch cartographers to compile the survey to an HCell and create the Feature Report Appendices of the DR. For processing and QC the hydrographer may use the Query functions in CARIS BDB and Notebook or the *treetemplates files in Pydro. Refer to section 8.2 of the HSSD for attribution requirements.\n4.4.3.2.4.3.1 Additional Attribute/Flagging Definitions & Examples\n4.4.3.2.4.3.1.1 Pydro Combination Flag Definition\nThe following subsections describe the most common Pydro flagging combinations for survey items, grouped by data acquisition type: items from bathymetry (HIPS processed depths flagged Outstanding and/or Designated), imagery (SIPS contacts), DPs, AWOIS, and other geographical positions (GPs). Note that all descriptions listed below are for Primary items. The Primary attribute/flag is no longer mandatory. In addition, the term \"Feature Report\" refers to the feature report created at the processing branch.\n1. Items from Bathymetry\n\u00b7 Resolved - Tis indicates any bathymetry feature that is not intended for the feature report (note the absence of the Report fag). Tis should be used for all designated soundings that were selected to force the uncertainty surface to honor the true sea foor--but not otherwise elevated to the level of desire for an explicit feature symbology on the chart.\n\u00b7 Chart, Resolved - Tis fag combination indicates any bathymetry feature that is included as an explicit feature on the PSS, but not intended for the feature report (note the absence of the Report fag). Tis fag combination is uncommon, but sometimes used when depicting complex shoreline with a series of DPs. Further information and reasoning should be detailed in the item's Remarks tab.\n\u00b7 Chart, Report, Resolved - This flag combination indicates any bathymetry feature that is included as an explicit feature on the PSS and is intended for the feature report. Further information and reasoning should be detailed in the item's Remarks tab.\n164\n\n\f\u00b7 Chart, DTON, Report, Submitted, Resolved - This flag combination indicates any bathymetry feature that is included as an explicit feature on the PSS, is specifically intended for the feature report, and has been submitted to MCD as a DTON. Further information and reasoning should be detailed in the item's Remarks tab.\n2. Items from Imagery\n\u00b7 Resolved - This flag combination indicates any insignificant contact that was not developed (otherwise imagery item should be Secondary to a bathymetry-based feature). Further information and reasoning should be detailed in the item's Remarks tab. This flag combination often indicates a contact that, after further evaluation, was determined to be insignificant.\n\u00b7 Tgt Exported, Resolved - This flag combination denotes a contact that was exported, presumably for subsequent investigation, and found to be insignificant (otherwise imagery item would be Secondary to a bathymetrybased item). The item is not intended for the feature report. Further information and reasoning should be detailed in the item's Remarks tab.\n\u00b7 Chart, Report, Resolved - This flag combination indicates any imagery item that was determined to be a significant contact, but was not investigated. The item is intended for the feature report. Further information and reasoning should be detailed in the item's Remarks tab. Imagery items should typically not be flagged Chart since they do not provide an accurate depth for charting. Except in extenuating circumstances, significant items from imagery should always be Secondary to a (Primary) bathymetry-based item. An example of when this flagging scenario could be used is when the field unit acquired SSS imagery, but left the area before a significant contact could be developed with bathymetry or diver investigation. This scenario is not common, but is sometimes unavoidable.\n3. Detached Positions (DPs)\n\u00b7 Rejected, Resolved - This flag combination indicates any detached positions that the hydrographer does not want to be part of the survey. Further information and reasoning as to why it was rejected, such as because it was a blunder or a DP on an unassigned AWOIS item, should be added in the feature's Remarks tab.\n\u00b7 Resolved - This flag indicates any detached positions included for informational purposes only, which are not intended for the feature report. Further information and reasoning should be detailed in the item's Remarks tab.\n\u00b7 Chart, Resolved -This flag combination indicates any detached positions that are depicted on the PSS as features but not intended for the feature report. Some examples of when this flagging scenario might be used are as follows: (i) recording bottom sample locations, (ii) positioning shoreline features, and (iii) verifying positions of aids to navigation.\n\u00b7 Chart, Report, Resolved - This flag combination indicates any detached positions that are depicted on the PSS as features and are intended for the feature report. Some examples of when this flagging scenario might be used are as follows: (i) least depths determined by DLDG that either do not have supporting echosounder bathymetry or any correlating echosounder bathymetry is flagged Secondary, and (ii) portraying complex shoreline, including issues such as changes to MHW and shoreline feature disprovals.\n4. AWOIS Items\n\u00b7 Resolved - This flag indicates an AWOIS item that was disproved using one of the investigation methods\n165\n\n\fassigned in the database record. It can also be used to indicate an AWOIS item that does not fall directly into a survey area, but whose search radius partially falls within the survey area, and has been or will be addressed by an adjoining survey. Further information should be added to the item's Remarks tab.\n\u00b7 Secondary--to [Primary] Bathymetry Item or DP (see section 4.4.4 for information on correlation) - This flag combination indicates any AWOIS item that was located/verified during the survey.\n\u00b7 Geographic Positions (GPs)- GPs are any point data that do not fit into another feature category. As Secondary items, they can be used to convey information that is outside the scope of standard features in Pydro. GPs may be either inserted into Pydro from some \"generic\" ASCII or database format or manually digitized via the context menu in a Pydro Chart Window. GPs can optionally be assigned under the sub-categories \"ChartGPs\" and \"Checkpoints\". An explicit function exists in Pydro to insert S-57 ENC features as ChartGPs into the PSS for evaluation of survey items in context with the (official) chart.\n\u00b7 Secondary ChartGPs are used to indicate the connection of the associated Primary item to an existing charted feature. Such a relationship instructs Pydro's DR document builder to file a Report feature under the \"Charted Features\" chapter; absence of a Secondary ChartGP (and no Secondary AWOIS) directs a Report feature to the \"New Features\" chapter.\n\u00b7 Checkpoint GPs can be created in Pydro if survey features do not exist at desired comparison locations for (say) a Pydro Points/Surface Stats Report.\n\u00b7 GPs can be created as placeholders for the information necessary to disprove a feature, without the need for an item to be explicitly logged during data acquisition. Photographs and other details about the techniques used to disprove a feature (e.g., search radius and method) are important pieces of information to include with such a disproval GP.\n4.4.3.2.4.3.1.2 Examples of Feature Attribution Using the NOAA Customized Attributes\nAssigned Features \u00ad Not Addressed descrp=5 Features that were \"Assigned\" in the CSF but not addressed. The reasoning should be detailed in the item's Remarks attribute. These features maintain the original SORDAT and SORIND.\nExample 1: An obstruction area was Assigned but not addressed due to high sea state making the area unsafe for operations. The feature is attributed as Not Addressed and an explanatory statement is included in the Remark field.\nExample 2: A charted rock was Assigned but not addressed due to the feature being inshore of the navigable area limit line of the survey. The feature is attributed as Not Addressed and an explanatory statement is included in the Remark field, such as \"inshore NALL\".\nAddressed Features with No Attribution Change descrp = 4 Features that were addressed and not edited in any way, maintain the original SORDAT and SORIND. Descriptive attribution of Retain along with a explanatory Remark should be added. This will alert the processing branch to either retain the charted feature or that the feature is depicted accurately if from another source.\nExample: A GC rock is Assigned and investigated during shoreline verification, it was found to correctly portray the feature. No existing attribution, such as height is changed. The feature is given descriptive attribution of Retain and a Remark .\n166\n\n\fNew Features descrp=1 New features that are identified are given a descriptive attribution of New along with an explanatory Remark and the SORDAT and SORIND populated with current survey entries.\nExample: A charted rock is found to be the high point of a large new navigationally significant reef. A SBDARE line (NATSUR = Rock) is digitized into the Final Feature File using the observed reef extents as a guide, assigned the new SORDAT and SORIND, given a Remark and the descriptive term New. The processing branch will create an area object of the SBDARE line.\nUpdated Features descrp=2 Updated features are comprised of features that have a change in Attribute or Object class, but do not have a change in position. The field modified something about the feature without moving it. Examples of the two main update types are below:\nUpdate Feature, Attribute Change:\nExample 1: A height measurement is taken for a GC rock. The rock is retained in the Final Feature File, VALSOU field populated, the feature is assigned the new SORDAT and SORIND and given the descriptive term Update. A Remark is included to note the addition of the height attribution.\nExample 2 : The color of a mooring buoy is found to be orange rather than the yellow shown on the chart. The COLOUR attribute is changed for the MORFAC feature, and the feature assigned the new SORDAT and SORIND and given the descriptive term Update. A Remark is included to note the change of the color attribution.\nUpdated Feature, Object Class Changed (geographic primitive unchanged)\nExample: A charted pile is found to be a dolphin. The PILPNT designation is changed to MORFAC, dolphin, and the new SORIND and SORDAT are assigned to the new feature. The feature object change is noted in Remarks and the feature is attributed with the descriptive term Update.\nRe-positioning features, changing a Geographic Primitive and altering or adding to the extents of an area feature:\nThe above scenarios all require two sets of features, one with a descrp =1 for the new position/primitive/extents, and the other with a descrp = 3, for the old position/primitive/extents. This indicates to the cartographer/ reviewer what has changed. The following are examples of these changes.\nRepositioned Features \u00ad Altering Geographic Position or Shape descrp= 1 for feature at new position, descrp=3 for feature at old position\nFor features that were repositioned or the geographic position or shape is altered, the original feature that has a position error is attributed with the descriptive term Delete, maintaining the original SORDAT and SORIND, given an appropriate Remark and Recommendation. The repositioned feature in the Fi- nal Feature File is assigned the new SORDAT and SORIND, will contain a Remark stating that it was repositioned and be given the descriptive term New.\nExample: A charted pile is discovered to be a dolphin 200 m to the west of the charted position. The new dolphin is digitized and given the new SORDAT and SORIND, a Remark, and descriptive attribution of New; the pile is\n167\n\n\fgiven the descriptive term Delete and it maintains the original SORDAT and SORIND, and the Remarks field is populated regarding the disproval of the pile. Because it is a charted feature a Recommendation is also required Geographic Primitive Altered (i.e. from point to area, or area to point)\ndescrp= 1 for feature with new geographic primitive, descrp= 3 for feature with old geometry\nIn any case where the geographic primitive is altered (i.e., point feature modified to a line; point modified to an area, etc.), the feature with the new geometry contains the descriptive attribution New and the feature with the old geometry is attributed with the descriptive term Delete.\nExample 1 : A charted obstruction area with snags/stumps is discovered to be the intact wreck of the privateer Black Pearl. The OBSTRN object is given the descriptive term Delete and it maintains its original SORDAT and SORIND. It is given a Remark, and because it is a charted feature disproval, it is also given a Recommendation. A new WRECKS point object is collected in the field or digitized to the Final Feature File, assigned the new SORDAT and SORIND, given the descriptive term New and a Remark.\nExample 2: A charted reef is found to be correctly positioned, but is determined to be a small islet rather than a reef. A LNDARE point object is used to depict the islet, and height given using a LNDELV object. The LNDARE and LNDELV objects are assigned a descriptor of New, are given a new SORDAT and SORIND and a Remark. The original reef is attributed with the descriptive term Delete maintaining its original SORDAT and SORIND. Because it is a charted feature disproval both a Remark and a Recommendation are added to the feature.\nNew or Adjusted Extents \u00ad Line or Area descrp = 1 for new or adjusted extent, descrp = 3 for old extent\nThe Final Feature File includes line features digitized to define new or modified limits of kelp beds, foul or rocky areas, ledges and reefs, where the extents were obtained using DPs, GPs, buffer lines, or surfaces from VBES and/ or MBES. The new SORDAT and SORIND are assigned and a Remark added, for instance \"New ledge\".\nExample 1 : The BASE Surface is used as a back drop to digitize the extents of a rocky seabed area using a SBDARE line object. The SBDARE line object (which will be created as an area object during branch processing) is included in the Final Feature File and assigned the new survey SORDAT and SORIND. Remarks are added to the line feature and it is attributed as New.\nExample 2: A maritime boundary MLLW water point is investigated, it is found to be at a more seaward location of an already charted ledge. The new extents are digitized using a SBDARE line object. The SBDARE line object is included in the Final Feature File and assigned the new survey SORDAT and SORIND. Remarks are added to the line feature and it is attributed with a descriptor of New and a special feature type of Maritime Boundary. The old extent of the ledge may need to be attributed as Delete and retains its original SORDAT and SORIND, and includes a Remark and Recommendation.\nDeconflicting Features descrp= 4 best position feature, descrp= 3 for features determined to be at incorrect position\nWhere features from multiple sources are given in the composite source for deconfliction, the feature that is selected as the best representation is attributed as Retain in the Final Feature File, maintaining its original SORDAT and SORIND. A statement as to why the feature was selected to be retained and what methods were used to make this determination is included in the Remarks field. The remaining features are attributed with the descriptive term Delete. Each disproved feature keeps its original SORDAT and SORIND and a Remark. A Recommendation must also accompany any currently charted features attributed with the descriptive term Delete.\n168\n\n\fExample 1: The composite source includes two features for deconfliction, one from the raster chart and one from GC, positioned in close proximity to each other and to a prior survey feature included in a reference file. The prior survey rock is found to be the best representation of the position of the rock. The prior survey rock is imported into the Final Feature File and given the descriptive term Retain along with a Remark. The prior survey feature maintains its original registry number and date for SORIND and SORDAT. The remaining two features, the GC and chart rocks, are attributed as Delete. The features retain their original SORDATs and SORINDs. Remarks are included for both, and a Recommendation accompanies the chart rock.\nExample 2: Where a LIDAR item is found by the field to be a charted feature, choose the better representation of the item and attribute it as Retain. If the LIDAR item is selected over a charted item, the LIDAR item remains in the Final Feature File and the charted feature is attributed as Delete. If the charted item is selected over a LIDAR item, the charted item remains in the Final Feature File and the LIDAR feature is attributed as Delete.\nDisprovals descrp=3 Features from Composite Source that have been disproved should be attributed with the descriptive term Delete, and should maintain the original SORDAT and SORIND. A Remark should indicate the reason for disproval. Disproved chart features also require a Recommendation.\nExample 1: A charted rock is disproved using MBES. The charted rock is given the descriptive term Delete where it maintains the original SORDAT and SORIND, the Remarks field is populated regarding the method of disproval, and a Recommendation to remove the feature from the chart is made.\nExample 2: A charted pier in ruins is not seen in the SSS imagery or in the MBES data. The pier is given the descriptive term Delete and should maintain the original SORDAT and SORIND. The remark field is populated with information regarding the method of disproval and a Recommendation to remove the pier from the chart is made.\nExample 3: LIDAR coverage over a charted feature shows no indication of the charted feature. The feature has subsequently been disproved using VBES, SWMB, etc. The charted feature is attributed as Delete and maintains its original SORDAT and SORIND, and the method of Disproval is indicated in Remarks. A Recommendation is also required for all Disprovals\n4.4.3.2.4.4 Feature Correlation\nIn a NOAA hydrographic survey new features can be automatically cor- related (i.e. associated or connected) with existing data using Pydro sofware. or manually correlated with CARIS Notebook, BDB or HYPACK. Te manual correlation in CARIS and HYPACK is achieved through NOAA ex- tended attributes. For further information, refer to section 8.2 of the HSSD\nTe existing data are typically classifed in one of the following fve categories:\n\u00b7 Items from Bathymetry \u00ad Sounding data (MBES or VBES) which has been identifed as a measurement of a least depth on a feature in CARIS HIPS or Pydro. \"Designated\" soundings can also be selected to force the gridded surface to honor the true depth of the seafoor.\n\u00b7 Items from Imagery \u00ad A potentially signifcant feature which has been identifed in SSS data, chosen as a contact in CARIS SIPS during post-processing, and to be evaluated for further investigation and/or development.\n169\n\n\f\u00b7 Detached Positions (DP) \u00ad Detached positions are used to position point features such as shoreline items, bottom sample locations, DLDG depth determinations, and lead line or pole soundings. DPs are subdivided into echosounder and non-echosounder types. Echosounder DPs are used for data with a corresponding depth determined by VBES, MBES, or another system which is referenced to a point other than the water's surface and require the application of vessel ofsets. Non-echosounder DPs are used to provide positions for data either with no associated depth information or referenced to the water's surface, such as DLDG determined depths and heights of shoreline features.\n\u00b7 AWOIS Items \u00ad AWOIS items represent features which have been previously reported or surveyed and are generally included on the current chart. Specifc AWOIS items within, or partially within, each survey area will be assigned for investigation.\n\u00b7 Geographic Positions (GP) \u00ad Geographic positions refer to point data used for various purposes and not otherwise classifed. Tese points are typically uploaded from a portable GPS system, manually digitized in CARIS, HYPACK, or Pydro, or created by inserting \"generic\" data into Pydro.\n\u00b7 Two sub-types of GPs exist in Pydro: \"Chart GPs\" and \"Checkpoints\". Te principal use of Chart GPs in Pydro is to indicate those survey items which represent new observations on existing charted features, or otherwise disprovals thereof. Checkpoints provide for a way to steer some comparison of survey data at discrete locations.\nAs each feature is evaluated, standard classification flags should be set. (A Pydro data flagging decision tree is provided in Figure 4.22 to assist the hydrographer with this process.) The basic process involves systematically reviewing survey data for features, by segregating correlating groups of items into a best- representative \"Primary\" item + supporting \"Secondary\" item(s). This decision process involves examining survey items in context with all supporting data available: any previously known items (AWOIS and other currently-charted features) and bathymetry (current survey, prior survey, charted soundings, etc). Note: An item from bathymetry representing the least depth of a navigationally significant real-world feature should always be marked Primary.\n170\n\n\fFigure 4.22: Pydro data fagging decision tree.\nFor all the correlating items that represent the same feature as the Primary item, set the status flag to Secondary. If an item has been automatically correlated to a Primary item, but does not appear to be the same feature, assign it as Primary. That is, use the Primary item status to segregate features. If your survey makes use of side scan sonar, this means you will often encounter disparate features through items from imagery before having supporting item(s) from bathymetry. Set the status flag to Primary for such items, knowing that if they prove to be navigationally significant, a bathy item will take precedence as the Primary item when available. If there are items that represent a common feature that have not been automatically correlated by distance, use Pydro's Group Features tool to manually associate those items.\nIn Pydro only, certain subsequent flagging actions on a feature need only be carried out on the Primary item because they are propagated through to the flags of all Secondary items. Each feature should be reviewed to determine if it is significant based on either the NOAA contact height criteria or some other criteria determined by the field unit. Other criteria include, but are not limited to, proximity to a maintained channel, predominant ship/boat traffic in the area, proximity to other significant features etc. If so, check the \"Significant\" flag. If the feature requires additional data acquisition to be resolved, also check the \"Investigate\" flag. The purpose of the Investigate flag is to remind the field hydrographer that more information, possibly involving additional data acquisition, is necessary to adequately resolve the least depth or nature of a feature. All items marked \"Investigate\" may be exported to MapInfo Interchange Format files (MIF/MID), HYPACK Target files (.tgt), or HYPACK S-57\n171\n\n\ffiles (.000) to facilitate additional data acquisition; the \"Tgt Exported\" flag is set upon item export. 4.4.4 Deliverables\nTe following feature fles shall be delivered with a survey. Te hydrographer shall adhere to Appendix 12 of the HSSD: Data Directory Structure for the proper directory structure:\n1. Feature Data:\n(a) Final Feature File in .000 format - (HXXXXX_Final_Features _File.000) - Te .000 fnal features layer contains the original source data with survey updates. Tis is the primary fle the branch cartographer will use to compile the survey to the HCell.\n(b) Final Pydro File (if applicable) in a .pss format (HXXXXX_Final_Features _File.pss) \u00ad Te .pss fnal features layer contains the original source data with survey updates. Te .pss is a supplemental fle which may or may not be used by the branch cartographer to compile the survey to the HCell.\n2. Multimedia - Photographs and images are very helpful to the cartographers during compilation. Multimedia is delivered with the fnal feature fle in the Multimedia folder. Te photographs and images are correlated or linked (depending on sofware) to the features.\n(a) Photographs \u00ad ex: new extents of piers, piles, rocks, etc.\n(b) Images\ni. MBES \u00ad ex: least depth on rock or wreck from CARIS 3-D viewer\nii. Side Scan Sonar Contact Images\nNote: A copy of the Side scan sonar contact images shall be delivered in the CARIS HDCS line fle.\n3. Side Scan Sonar (SSS) Contacts in .000 format \u00ad All SSS contacts, both significant and insignificant, shall be delivered in .000 format and submitted in the S-57 Features Folder. The side scan sonar contact points shall be delivered as the S-57 feature object cartographic symbol ($CSYMB) with the attribution described above in Section 8.2 of the HSSD.\n\u00b7 Example 1 : Te BASE Surface is used as a back drop to digitize the extents of a rocky seabed area using a SBDARE line object. Te SBDARE line object (which will be created as an area object during branch processing) is included in Final_Features and assigned the new survey SORDAT and SORIND. Remarks are added to the line feature and it is attributed as New.\n\u00b7 Example 2: A maritime boundary MLLW water point is investigated, it is found to be at a more seaward location of an already charted ledge. Te new extents are digitized using a SBDARE line object. Te SBDARE line object is included in Final_Features and assigned the new survey SORDAT and SORIND. Remarks are added to the line feature and it is attributed as New. Te old extent of the ledge may need to be attributed as Delete and retains its original SORDAT and SORIND, and includes a Remark and Recommendation.\nDeconficting Features\ndescrp= 4 best position feature, descrp= 3 for features determined to be at incorrect position\n172\n\n\fWhere features from multiple sources are given in the composite source for deconfiction, the feature that is selected as the best representation is attributed as Retain in Final_Features, maintaining its original SORDAT and SORIND. A statement as to why the feature was selected to be retained and what methods were used to make this determination is included in the Remarks feld. Te remaining features are attributed with the descriptive term Delete. Each disproved feature keeps its original SORDAT and SORIND and is given a Remark. A Recommendation must also accompany any currently charted features attributed with the descriptive term Delete.\n\u00b7 Example 1: Te composite source includes two features for deconfiction, one from the raster chart and one from GC, positioned in close proximity to each other and to a prior survey feature included in a reference fle. Te prior survey rock is found to be the best representation of the position of the rock. Te prior survey rock is imported into the Final Feature layer and given the descriptive term Retain along with a Remark. Te prior survey feature maintains its original registry number and date for SORIND and SORDAT. Te remaining two features, the GC and chart rocks, are attributed as Delete. Te features retain their original SORDATs and SORINDs. Remarks are included for both, and a Recommendation accompanies the chart rock.\n\u00b7 Example 2: Where a LIDAR item is found by the feld to be a charted feature, choose the better representation of the item and attribute it as Retain. If the LIDAR item is selected over a charted item, the LIDAR item remains in the Final_Features layer and the charted feature is attributed as Delete. If the charted item is selected over a LIDAR item, the charted item remains in the Final_Features layer and the LIDAR feature is attributed as Delete.\nDisprovals descrp=3\nFeatures from Composite Source that have been disproved should be attributed with the descriptive term Delete, and should maintain the original SORDAT and SORIND. A Remark should indicate the reason for disproval. Disproved chart features also require a Recommendation.\n\u00b7 Example 1: A charted rock is disproved using MBES. Te charted rock is given the descriptive term Delete where it maintains the original SORDAT and SORIND, the Remarks feld is populated regarding the method of disproval, and a Recommendation to remove the feature from the chart is made.\n\u00b7 Example 2: A charted pier in ruins is not seen in the SSS imagery or in the MBES data. Te pier is given the descriptive term Delete and should maintain the original SORDAT and SORIND. Te remark feld is populated with information regarding the method of disproval and a Recommendation to remove the pier from the chart is made.\n\u00b7 Example 3: LIDAR coverage over a charted feature shows no indication of the charted feature. Te feature has subsequently been disproved using VBES, SWMB, etc. Te charted feature is attributed as Delete and maintains its original SORDAT and SORIND, and the method of Disproval is indicated in Remarks. A Recommendation is also required for all Disprovals.\n4.5 Chart Comparison\nCompare each hydrographic survey to the latest versions or editions of the largest scale ENC's and raster charts that cover the project area. Conduct the comparison in accordance with section 8.1.4., D.1 of the HSSD. Te specifc method of comparison is lef to the discretion of the hydrographer, though the comparison is typically done using Pydro, CARIS, or MapInfo sofware. When performing a chart comparison, the hydrographer shall use the most current ofcial charts available. If necessary or required by the Project Instructions, additional evaluation methods such as junction survey comparisons or prior survey comparisons may also be used.\n173\n\n\f4.5.1 Obtaining and Identifying Current Charts\nThe hydrographer should keep in mind that the most current official charts may not be the ones provided on the Project CD/DVD. Often, versions of raster and/or ENC charts used for vessel navigation will be more current. Any chart corrections from the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency's (NGA) Notice to Mariners (NTM), the United States Coast Guard's Local Notice to Mariners (LNM), and Canadian Hydrographic Service (CHS) that have not yet been applied should also be considered. For additional chart correction information, the database of NTM corrections can be queried online at: http://msi.nga.mil/NGAPortal/MSI.portal LNM corrections can be reviewed online at: http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/\n4.5.1.1 Raster Navigational Charts (RNC)\nPrior to chart comparisons, the most current RNC can be downloaded from MCD at http://www.charts.noaa. gov/. For raster charts, the edition, corrections applied, and date of notices through which the chart has been \"cleared\" will be included in the *.KAP fle header information, which can be viewed using a text editor such as WordPad. Te term \"cleared\" means that all notices up to, and including, the one issued on the cleared date have been reviewed and any corrections have been applied to that raster chart. Edition and correction information has been identifed in the example header fle section in section 4.2.4 .\nFigure 4.23: Section of a *.KAP fle (opened in WordPad) identifying chart edition and corrections that have been applied to the digital fle. Note: CHS does not issue corrections for this chart area, so no cleared date is listed.\nNote: Some of the chart information identifed in Figure 4.24 is repeated in the header line beginning with \"NTM.\" In this example, NE=10.56 refers to what the raster manufacturer calls the \"Notice Edition.\" It is the number of digital patches (56) applied to that chart edition (10). ND refers to the \"Notice Date,\" and repeats the NGA NTM cleared date. BD is the \"Base Date\" and repeats the chart edition date.\n4.5.1.2 Electronic Navigational Charts (ENC)\nTe most current ENC can be downloaded from MCD at http://www.charts.noaa.gov/.\nTe ENC Update Application Date is the date that the full ENC Cell was frst posted or re-posted. Tis date is similar to the Edition Date of a raster chart. ENC Cells are re-posted when the updates grow too large or a large section of the Cell is re-built. Te Issue Date identifes when the last correction was applied. All notices have been applied through that date, similar to a \"cleared\" date for raster charts. If using an ECDIS system or viewer sofware to read the ENC, these dates can be found in the ENC Cell properties.\nNote: Some viewer manufacturers have erroneously reversed the Update Application Date and Issue Date. Since an edition must exist before it can be corrected, the later of these two dates will always be the Issue Date.\n174\n\n\f4.5.2 Junction Survey Comparisons If the designated limits for a survey junction with modern data from another survey, the area of overlap should be compared and discussed in the Descriptive Report. OCS considers a standard junction comparison acceptable if sounding variance is 1 meter or less between the present and junctioning surveys. Agreement is considered poor if sounding variance is greater than 1 meter. In such cases, the hydrographer should attempt to determine the cause(s) of signifcant discrepancies and explain these variances in the Descriptive Report. 4.5.3 Prior Survey Comparisons Due to the advances in survey technology and data coverage capabilities, modern survey data will nearly always supersede historical data. Tus, prior-survey comparisons are generally not required by feld personnel, but may be used at the discretion of the hydrographer for quality control purposes. If the present survey has numerous conficts with charted soundings and/or features, then the hydrographer should consider conducting a prior survey comparison. If a prior survey comparison is performed, the reason it was deemed necessary should be discussed in the Descriptive Report and the applicable prior survey(s) should be identifed by registry number, date of survey, and scale.\n175\n\n\fChapter 5\nData Management and Survey Deliverables\nThe purpose of this chapter is to define data management and deliverable requirements for NOAA field units conducting OCS hydrographic surveys. These requirements have been established to safeguard hydrographic data during field operations, support efficient office processing, and expedite the application of survey data to NOAA's navigational products.\n5.1 Data Management\nA typical OCS hydrographic survey produces an extensive amount of data; thus, proper data management is critical. Two primary components of data management are addressed in this chapter: data security, releasability, storage, and data filing and organization. It is the field unit's responsibility to manage all survey data such that its security and integrity are not compromised during operations, and to efficiently transmit these data to AHB, PHB, or other designated recipient(s).\n5.1.1 Data Security, Releasability and Storage\nHydrographers should take special care to ensure that hydrographic data security is carried out and released according to OCS policy. All hydrographic personnel should always consider possible liability issues that may be associated with dissemination of preliminary data. Further guidance is given below in this section and contact information for these authorities will be identified in the Project Instructions.\nAdditionally, data and reports generated while conducting OCS hydrographic surveys are official records that must be cataloged and archived. Since the majority of these data and reports are in digital format, a field unit's digital data storage systems must be configured, operated, and maintained with care. Precautions should be taken against data loss due to careless handling, accidental corruption, or system failure.\n5.1.1.1 Data Security\nIt is the field unit's responsibility to maintain all survey records in a manner that ensures data is accessible only to the appropriate survey personnel and system administrators. Tracking procedures should be used to identify which personnel have performed specific tasks for all data acquisition, processing, and manipulation. Data secure can be maintained within a field unit via a combination of procedural checklists and logs, as well as establishing computer user accounts with password protection.\nField units may receive requests for survey data from constituents and private parties. Field units shall obtain approval from the Chief-of-Party prior to releasing any preliminary data or products to parties outside of OCS.\nNote: Any preliminary data product released must be clearly annotated in accordance with section 5.2.2.4of this manual.\n172\n\n\fA copy of all products released to the public shall be included in the Public_Relations_&_Constituent_Products folder of the survey submission package. The field unit shall document all survey records or constituent products officially transmitted using a digitally signed NOAA standard form Letter Transmitting Data (NOAA Form 6129), which can be created in Pydro. A record of all transmittal letters created and received should be maintained by the field unit.\n5.1.1.1.1 Special Data Handling Requirements Special handling requirements will be described in the Project Instructions from HSD Operations Branch. Examples of situations requiring special data handling are below. All newly discovered uncharted shipwrecks are to be treated as significant and vulnerable historic resources. This treatment entails following the data handling guidance in section 4.4.2.4 of this manual. Raw or processed data from sources external to NOAA are not to be made available to the public at any time. Certain homeland security survey data have special handling requirements prescribed by the US Naval Oceanographic Office and OCS as described in the NAVMETOCCOMINST 3142A documents included in Appendix 2:\n5.1.1.2 Data Releasability Field units or HSD/NSD office personnel should be aware that the policy information mentioned here is set forth such that the release of raw or working data do not provide a company an unfair competitive advantage within its industry or carry with it liability issues that may be associated with the dissemination of this data. These policies are also set to adhere to the National Historic Preservation Act of 1996 and the Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979. Information about all newly uncharted navigationally significant and potentially historical man-made features, particularly position coordinates, is considered sensitive material. The field shall not release this information to the general public without permission from HSD. Figure 5.1 illustrates a general flow diagram of HSD's processes to plan hydrographic surveys, acquire, process, quality control and compile hydrographic data to create products.\nFigure 5.1: General flow diagram of HSD's processes. According to the OCS Policy for the Release of Mission Data, there are three defined stages for Mission Data (see the OCS policy for more information about each of these stages):\n173\n\n\f\u00b7 Raw Data: data as it is originally collected manually, from sensors, or received from other sources such as other federal agencies.\n\u00b7 Working Data: data on which processing has been performed that changes the information contained in the data but which is not yet processed to a level deemed as complete and suitable for public release (e.g. data that has undergone a Survey Acceptance Review (SAR).\n\u00b7 Data Product: data which has been processed or accepted without further processing which is considered to be suitable for release to the public and which OCS acknowledges as official (e.g. BAG after approval).\nDue to the increase in requests for digital data at all stages, HSD has been working with the National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC), which stores this data, to release the data to the public at the following stages in HSD's pipeline:\n1. After the ships have sent the raw data to NGDC.\n2. After the working data has undergone a SAR and AHB/PHB has sent it to NGDC (Post-SAR).\n3. After OCS acknowledges the data as official\nNote: All personnel should note that all new data will be in the BAG format instead of the previously archived ascii xyz format. The BAG format was developed to create an open source exchange format for gridded data therefore any public requester should be able to use data in this format (see section 5.2.1.1 of the HSSD)\nONLY DATA AT NGDC CAN BE RELEASED TO A REQUESTER. HSD/NSD office personnel, responding to a request, should direct the requester to a point of contact at NGDC (which can be identified by HSD). Official data is available via NGDC's website http://map.ngdc.noaa.gov/viewers/index.html (NGDC will have a website for the public to retrieve raw or post-SAR data in the future).\nIt should be noted that field units shall NOT release raw or processed data to a requester outside of OCS. Also field units shall NOT create specialized products in response to a data request unless authorized by their supervisor. Data requests for processed data which are still on the vessel must comply with the guidance in section 5.2.2.4 of this manual and ensure that an effort should be made to meet the needs of the requester without being unduly time consuming.\nIf the Chief Hydrographer feels the requester has reasonable cause to warrant the release of raw data which are still on the ship and have not been sent to AHB/PHB then, (s)he must obtain written approval by the appropriate Division Chief (i.e. the Chief, Hydrographic Surveys Division or Chief, Navigation Services Division) to release these data. Raw data, if release is approved, should be distributed with a disclaimer describing, in general:\n\u00b7 Things that have not been done (e.g. list correctors that haven't been applied).\n\u00b7 Uses of the raw data that are not appropriate.\n\u00b7 Anything else the Chief Hydrographer or Chief of HSD feels necessary to include.\n174\n\n\fAdditionally, metadata should be provided in conformance with applicable standards and such metadata should be entered in to the appropriate national metadata data base. Finally, an official record of raw data distributions shall be made and preserved (contact the Chief of HSD/NSD for more information).\nLikewise, if the Chief of AHB/PHB is forced to distribute Post-SAR (working data) or feels the requester has reasonable cause to warrant the release of processed data which are in line to undergo a SAR, field units or HSD/ NSD office personnel responding to a request must obtain written approval by the appropriate Division Chief to release this data. Post-SAR data, if release is approved, should have a strong disclaimer letter that accompanies the data and indicates enough major flaws to discourage its use and further requests. Additionally, before releasing this data three steps should be taken:\n1. The data or a transmittal document shall be marked appropriately taking into consideration the recipients intended use. Suitable markings might be: 'Preliminary Data \u00ad contents may change', or 'Draft \u00ad not to be used for navigation', or 'Working file \u00ad processing has not been completed and significant corrections may yet be applied'.\n2. The recipient shall be counseled as to the known condition of the data, the nature of possible changes, and other known considerations that would help the recipient use the data in a prudent manner.\n3. The provider should mark the data set or accompanying transmittal document indicating to whom the file was provided, and that the recipient was counseled as to the status of the data. The provider shall then prepare and preserve an official record (contact the Chief of HSD/NSD for more guidance \u00ad this should be in line with how NGDC records requests) that data was provided, to whom, for what use, on what date, that counseling was provided, and who made the determination and released the data.\n5.1.1.3 Data Storage\nAll storage devices and media used for OCS hydrographic survey data should be approved by HSD and/or HSTP. Field units shall not implement new data storage technology or media without first consulting HSD and/or HSTP to verify that the system is both based on proven technology and is compatible with equipment at other NOAA sites that may need to access the survey data.\nNOAA's hydrographic survey ships are typically equipped with Network Appliance (NetApp) data storage systems. The NetApp system consists of dual Redundant Array of Independent Disks(RAID) arrays with independent control heads. Each NetApp system should be set up in a mirrored crossover configuration with daily and weekly snapshots to provide data redundancy and recoverability in case of partial system failure. With this type of system redundancy, if one control head fails, the second will assume control of both RAID arrays; if one RAID array fails completely, a copy of the data will remain on the second RAID. Data recoverability is provided by \"point-intime\" snapshots of the data that can be used to restore directories that have been inadvertently deleted or become corrupt. OCS strongly recommends physically separating the two NetApp control heads to prevent catastrophic data loss due to a point event such as an isolated fire.\nNavigation Response Teams use a different type of data storage system to meet their specific mission needs. typical NRT data storage systems consist of one Network Attached Storage(NAS) unit that is regularly backed up onto an external hard drive. This type of system combination should be configured to automatically compare the two drives for differences periodically throughout the day. If any new data are found on the NAS, those files should be automatically mirrored onto the external hard drive.\n175\n\n\f5.1.1.3.1 Data Backup Requirements\nRegardless of the data storage system used, each NOAA hydrographic field unit must ensure that all survey data that have not been previously submitted to, and accepted by, either AHB or PHB are routinely backed up. Backups shall be performed such that a complete systems failure would result in no more than one day of data lost. For example, weekly full backups and daily incremental backups would ensure that the maximum loss of data would only be those files modified or created in the time between the previous incremental backup and the failure. The method used to backup data may vary and could include CDs, DVDs, or redundant drive system. Many backup systems, such as the NetApp, can be configured to perform scheduled backups automatically. It is the responsibility of the field unit to verify that their backup solution is operational throughout the field season.\nNote: If using a NetApp system, OCS recommends it be configured to retain 6 daily snapshots and 2 weekly snapshots, providing access to files up to 20 days old (best case).\n5.1.1.3.2 Data Transfer\nData can be transferred from field units using a variety of media or portable hard drives. However, field units should ensure that data transfer media is compatible with the data recipient's equipment. Regardless of the method used for data transfer, there will always be a risk of damage, loss, or corruption of data during the transfer process. OCS recommends that field units retain a backup of any data transmitted until a successful transfer has been confirmed by the recipient.\nWhen survey data have been submitted to NGDC, AHB or PHB, field units are required to retain a backup of this data until NGDC or the hydrographic branch has acknowledged that the data have been successfully archived and the Survey Acceptance Review has been completed (the Survey Acceptance Review only pertains to processed data). Even after data has been successfully transferred, OCS recommends the field unit retain copies of final survey products created (e.g., PSS, DR, MapInfo tables, public outreach materials, etc) on removable storage media if additional operations will be conducted in that general project area.\n5.1.2 Data Filing and Organization\nDue to the quantity of data generated during an OCS hydrographic survey, standardized data filing and organization practices should be used. These methods may vary among field units during data acquisition and processing, but it is imperative that a standardized system be used across all field units for data submission to AHB and PHB. Clearly named files, standardized directory structures, and common practices will all contribute to efficient data management and survey processing.\n5.1.2.1 Field Unit Data Directory Structure\nIt is very important for a field unit to establish a working data directory structure that is consistent across the data acquisition and processing computers and storage devices throughout the unit. When designing a working directory structure, any specific software requirements must be considered. For example, CARIS HIPS/SIPS data must be configured with a specific directory structure so that referenced information can be accessed by the software. An expanded view of a sample CARIS directory structure is shown in Figure 5.2.\n176\n\n\fFigure 5.2: Field unit directory structure.\nOCS recommends that field units store raw and post-processed data in separate directories. Typically, raw data will be organized by survey registry number with subfolders further sorting the data by acquisition system type, then by vessel (HVF name), by day, and finally by line. This type of file structure is referred to as PVDL (Project/ Vessel/Day/Line).\nNote: The \"vessel\" subfolder name must be identical to the CARIS HIPS Vessel File (HVF) name for the data it contains.\nPost-processed data are typically organized by survey registry number and then subdivided according to the directory structure required by CARIS HIPS/SIPS software.\nRaw data files are often quite large. As a result, storage of raw data may become unmanageable if many surveys are in progress at once. Therefore the field unit shall transmit a project's survey sheet to NGDC prior to submission of the remaining survey records to AHB or PHB. The field unit shall follow standard data submission procedures as documented in section 8.4 of the HSSD and the standard data directory structure as shown below in figure 5.3. The Raw Public folder shall contain all pre-processed sonar (bathymetry and backscatter if applicable) and sound speed profile data acquired for the survey. Raw sonar data should be organized by acquisition system, vessel (HVF name), and day number. For example, if mainscheme MBES data was acquired by NOAA Ship Thomas\n177\n\n\fJefferson on 27 June 2006 for survey H12345, the file structure might be: H12345_MBES > TJ_S222_Reson7125 > 2006_178. If rejected and/or non-converted sonar files are submitted they should be contained in a separate folder designated for that purpose. Raw sound speed profile data should be separated into subfolders by vessel hull number and day. The configuration file (*.con) for each sound speed profiling instrument used for survey operations must be included in the Preprocess folder. Once the field unit receives notification from NGDC that all data have been successfully archived, the field unit may remove the corresponding raw data from their system.\nFigure 5.3: Field Unit Raw Data Directory Structreu.\n5.1.2.2 Survey Data Submission Directory Structure Since surveys are submitted to the hydrographic branches from several NOAA field units and each survey includes data from numerous sources, standardized data submission practices shall be used to support efficient office processing and verification. The standard file structure to be used by NOAA field units when submitting OCS hydrographic survey data to either AHB or PHB is outlined below, with a brief description of each section. A pictorial representation of this file structure is shown in Figure 5.4. Specific survey deliverables are discussed in section 5.2 See Appendix 5 for a (Digital Data Submission Checklist). Note: If files to be included in a specific subfolder have either not been generated at the time of data submission or are not required for a specific survey, the subfolder shall not be eliminated from the directory structure even though it is empty. By maintaining the complete submission directory structure, a data recipient can quickly verify that no items have been overlooked or inadvertently moved/deleted.\n5.1.2.2.1 Field Unit_YYYY (e.g., RAINIER_2006) This folder shall be named to identify the field unit and year of data submission. It should contain any pertinent information that applies to all hydrographic survey data acquired by that unit over the course of the year specified. At a minimum, the following subfolder shall be included: HSRR - Include a digital copy of the field unit's Hydrographic Systems Readiness Memo and corresponding Hydrographic Systems Readiness Acknowledgment as defined in Chapter 1 of this manual.\n178\n\n\f5.1.2.2.2 HXXXXX\nThis folder shall be named to identify the registry number of the survey being submitted. It should contain only survey-specific data and reports that have been approved for submission by the Chief-of-Party. At a minimum, the following subfolders shall be included\n\u00b7 Checksum File - The MD-5 Checksum files (.md5) shall be included directly under the HXXXXX folder (not in a subfolder) in order for the file verifying software, FileVerifier ++, to work properly during verification at NGDC, AHB or PHB.\n\u00b7 Data - NOAA field units shall deliver the following in the Data folder:\n\u00b7 Processed\nFieldsheets - This folder shall include the following CARIS fieldsheet(s). All preliminary fieldsheets should be removed from this folder prior to data submission.\nH12345 - This fieldsheet should contain all finalized BASE surfaces and mosaics for the survey. If, for data management, multiple fieldsheets are necessary to represent final survey data, fieldsheets shall be named such that the contents are easily inferred (e.g. H12345_SSS). Each BASE surface shall be named such that the survey registry number and BASE surface resolution are identified (e.g., H12345_50cm_A, H12345_1m_B, or H12345_2m_B). There shall be absolutely no periods or special characters used in the surface names.\nEach side scan mosaic shall be named such that the survey registry number, mosaic resolution, and SSS percentage are clearly identified. For example, a first 100% SSS mosaic at three meter resolution would be named H12345_3m_100. A corresponding 200% SSS mosaic would be named H12345_3m_200. There shall be absolutely no periods or special characters used in the mosaic names.\nHDCS_DATA -This folder shall contain all post-processed data generated in CARIS for the survey being submitted. Data shall be further organized using subfolders to create a Project Vessel/ Day / Line PVDL structure, as required for use with CARIS software. All extraneous data shall be removed from this folder prior to data submission.\nVesselConfig - This folder shall include copies of each HIPS Vessel File (*.HVF) used to process data for the survey and any applicable DeviceModels.xml files. Any modifications made to these files during survey operations should be documented in the corresponding Descriptive Report and/or DAPR.\nS-57_Features - Include in this folder the Final Feature File and the side scan sonar (SSS) contacts file in .000 format.\nPSS \u00ad This folder shall include Pydro .pss files. Do not include images in this folder.\nMultimedia - This folder shall contain 3-D bathymetric images or digital photographs that are associated with a feature in the Final Feature File (FFF). In addition, this folder shall contain a copy of the side scan sonar (SSS) contact images for both significant and insignificant contacts. A copy of the SSS contact images shall remain in the CARIS HDCS line file.\n179\n\n\fGNSS_Data \u00ad This folder shall include the Post-Processed Kinematic (PPK) GPS data, SBET QC Log, and SBET folder.\nSVP - This folder shall include only the processed CARIS *.svp files applied to the survey data being submitted. Files should be separated into subfolders by vessel hull number and day.\nTide - This folder shall include only the project tide files (tide zone file (.zdf), TCARI (.tc), GPS tide files (SEP Models), etc..) and tide/water level (*.tid) files applied to the survey data at the time of submission. Files should be named so that the type of tide/water level data (i.e., predicted, preliminary, verified or fiis identified\n\u00b7 Separates - This folder shall contain a subfolder for each Separate report identified below.\nAcquisition_&_Processing_Logs\nAcquisition Logs - This folder shall contain all acquisition log files associated with the survey being sub mitted (Note: Acquisition and Processing Log files may be combined into one file and delivered in one combined folder).\nProcessing Logs - This folder shall contain all Processing log files associated with the survey being submitted (Note: Acquisition and Processing Log files may be combined into one file and delivered in one combined folder).\nII. Digital Data\nCheckpoint_Summary_&_Crossline_Comparisons - This folder shall contain documentation to support a mainscheme to crossline comparison performed in accordance with section 5.2.4.3 of the HSSD.\nSound_Speed_Data Summary- Include all digital DQA records associated with the survey being submitted. Velocipy software automatically generates a digital DQA record for each project (e.g., OPR-###- AA-YY.DQA) and appends to this file nnn when DQA tests are performed. Refer to section [sub:Documentation-and-ReportingLeadLine].\nDescriptive Report - This folder shall contain the Descriptive Report for the survey in a .pdf format which includes the digitally signed DR approval sheet, DR body, and DR Appendices.\nPublic Relations and Constituent Products - This folder shall contain survey related products generated by the field unit for dissemination to other NOAA offices or outside organizations. Include any final Map- Info tables and workspaces for plots, \"one-pagers\" (in *.pdf format) created for public relations, and any other preliminary products released to constituents, navigation managers, or the public in the native format provided.\n5.1.2.3 Project Reports\nThis folder shall be named to identify the project number under which the submitted survey is assigned. It should contain subfolders for documents and reports that apply to all surveys completed for a given project over the course of the year specified. At a minimum, the following subfolders shall be included:\n180\n\n\fData Acquisition and Processing Report (DAPR) - Include the Data Acquisition and Processing Report for the project (in *.pdf format) and any supporting information as defined by the HSSD. The DAPR file should be named according to the project number (e.g., OPR-A###-AA-YY_DAPR.pdf.) Horizontal and Vertical Control Report (HVCR) - Include the Horizontal and Vertical Control report for the project (OPR-A###-AA-YY_HVCR.pdf) and any supporting information as defined by the HSSD and section 5.2.2.2.3 of this manual. No report is necessary if no HorCon and/or VerCon were conducted; however, a text document stating that no HorCon and/or VerCon operations were conducted shall be placed in this folder in lieu of an HVCR. Project Correspondence - Include all project correspondence such as documented telephone conversations and email correspondence that pertain to the survey being submitted.\nFigure 5.4: Submission Directory Structure\n181\n\n\f5.1.2.4 Naming Conventions\nIt is critical that file naming conventions be standardized to quickly communicate what information a file contains. (See section 8.1 of the HSSD for specific file names). As a standard practice, use the survey registry number (H12345) rather than survey priority designations when naming survey files. Any files submitted that will be unfamiliar to the receiving hydrographic branch and/or do not follow standard naming conventions shall be accompanied by a separate digital text document fully describing the file(s). This text file shall be named \"read me\", with an appropriate extension, and should be located at the top level of the directory structure containing the unfamiliar or non-standard files.\n5.2 Survey Deliverables\nSurvey deliverables refer to all data, reports, and products associated with an OCS hydrographic survey that will be approved and submitted by a NOAA field unit. When submitting a survey to AHB or PHB, the data deliverables shall include all data and information necessary for office verification, including the ability to manipulate data if necessary, thorough documentation of the field unit's survey procedures, and results and recommendations for the survey. Some survey deliverables, such as DTON Reports, the Request for Tides, Coast Pilot Review, and NODC files, have additional and/or unique submission requirements. All required OCS hydrographic survey deliverables and any specific submission requirements are briefly described in the following sections.\n5.2.1 Digital Data\nIf possible, all data shall be submitted to AHB or PHB in digital format. This requirement includes documents that can be easily scanned into *.pdf files, such as memos, system calibration reports, and DP reports. Digital data shall be submitted using the directory structure described in section 5.1.2.2 and illustrated in Figure 5.4, see section 8.1 and L Appendix 12 of HSSD for further details. Only data that pertains to the survey being submitted should be included in the digital data deliverables. All preliminary, temporary, or working data files shall be removed prior to submission.\nPrior to submitting digital data, the field unit shall verify that all files are present and none have become corrupt during transfer to a portable media.\nThe field unit shall generate a UNIX formatted MD-5 hash of the content of the entire directory structure and include it in the digital data submission. This shall be done using FileVerifier++ following the FileVerifier++ SOP in Appendix 5.\nAdditionally, a digital directory listing of data on the transfer media should be created and compared to the original file structure. The field unit shall include this directory listing, as a text file named to reference the transmittal letter number, in the data submission package. This directory listing can be generated and automatically sent to a text file by typing \"dir /s submission directory name > transmittal reference number.txt\" (e.g., dir /s H12345 > RU-2-06.txt) at the Windows Command Prompt.\nTo ensure that a complete data recovery is possible in case of lost mailings or media problems, the procedures below shall be followed by each field unit when submitting final digital survey data to AHB or PHB:\n\u00b7 Verify that backups of all data being submitted have been made and are securely stored. Backups must be in a format that can be readily restored at the receiving Hydrographic Branch.\n182\n\n\f\u00b7 Review the content of all backups and deliverable digital media to ensure they are complete, accurate, and structured in accordance with OCS specifications.\n\u00b7 Retain the backup for a survey until notified by AHB or PHB that the data have been successfully archived and the Survey Acceptance Review has been completed (Survey Acceptance Review is only required for processed data).\n5.2.1.1 POSPac Deliverables NOAA field units using POSPac MMS processing may satisfy the ERS based deliverables defined in section 8.4.5 of the HSSD with the following items: Raw Files\n\u00b7 Raw POSPac Files with naming convention YYYY_DDD_VSSL.000 (ex. 2010_123_S220.000) \u00b7 Files shall be Unlimited in size but not more than 24 hours long. \u00b7 Base Station Files in native format, if native format is other than RINEX \u00b7 Base Station Files in RINEX version 2.11+\n\u00b7 Including navigation (.yyN) as well as observation files (.yyO). \u00b7 RINEX files must include all types of dual-frequency observations, including manufacturers SNRs:\nC1, L1, L2, P2, P1, S1, and S2 \u00b7 RINEX header shall include at a minimum: station / marker name, receiver type / S/N, antenna type / S/N and antenna height \u00b7 May use Compact RINEX (Hatanaka)\n\u00b7 Final Ephemerides \u00b7 user_basestation_db.xml file containing Project wide base station positions overridden in POSPac\nCoordinate Manager (C:\\Program Files\\Common Files\\Applanix\\User Base Stations\\user_basestation_ db.xml) \u00b7 APPA_RSDB5.out file, if it has been modified from the Applanix default: C:\\Program Files \\Applanix\\ POSPac MMS 5.3\\APPA_RSDB5.out\n183\n\n\fProcessed Files\n\n\u00b7 50 Hz SBET (0.02 seconds) and SMRMSG output files with naming convention YYYY_DDD_VSSL. sbet and YYYY_DDD_VSSL.smrmsg\n\n\u00b7 All .log files from the Extract and Proc POSPac Project folders\n\n\u00b7 Plots2\n\n\u00b7 Smoothed Performance Metrics, Reference Frame (One graph per bullet)\n\n\u00b7 North, East and Down Position Error RMS (m)\n\n*\n\n\u00b7 North, East and Down Velocity Error RMS (m/sec)\n\n\u00b7 Roll, Pitch and Heading Error RMS (arc-min)\n\n\u00b7 Calibrated Installation Parameters (One graph per bullet) \u00b7 X Reference-Primary GPS Lever Arm (m) \u00b7 Y Reference-Primary GPS Lever Arm (m) \u00b7 Z Reference-Primary GPS Lever Arm (m) \u00b7 Reference \u00ad Primary GPS Lever Arm Figure of Merit\n\n\u00b7 Solution Status (One graph per bullet) \u00b7 Number of SVs \u00b7 PDOP \u00b7 Baseline Length (m) \u00b7 Processing mode\n\n\u00b7 Separation model file \u00b7 Current acceptable model file formats: ASCII XYZ,NGS BIN.\n\nNote: Substitutes for POSPac plots may be acceptable if they provide all the information needed in a format acceptable to HSD and are agreed upon ahead of time by the field unit, receiving branch, and OPS.\n\n5.2.2 Reports and Field Products\n\nVarious reports and field products will be generated in conjunction with an OCS hydrographic survey. Survey reports can be divided into three tiered categories. Field Unit Reports refer to those providing information that encompasses the entire field unit and its operations. Project Reports are those containing information that applies to all surveys completed (or to be completed) within a project for a specific year. Project Reports may reference information contained in Field Unit Reports, provided the referenced document is clearly identified and readily available for review. Survey Reports contain information specific to only one survey and may reference information contained in both Field Unit Reports and Project Reports, provided the referenced documents are clearly identified and readily available for review.\n\nThis section of the FPM provides an overview of reports and products to be submitted in conjunction with every OCS hydrographic survey completed by a NOAA field unit. Each of these reports shall be delivered to the hydrographic branch that supports that field unit unless a different recipient is explicitly identified either in this manual or the Project Instructions.\n\n184\n\n\f5.2.2.1 Field Unit Reports\n5.2.2.1.1 Hydrographic Systems Readiness Review (HSRR) Memo\nThe only OCS-mandated Field Unit Report is the annual Hydrographic Systems Readiness Review (HSRR) Memo (see Appendix 1). The HSRR Memo is to be submitted on an annual basis within 10 working days of commencing survey operations at the start of the field season. Details on the submission of the HSRR Memo are in 1.1.1 .\n5.2.2.2 Project Reports\n5.2.2.2.1 Survey Progress and Vessel Utilization Reports\nMonthly Survey Progress Estimates (formerly Progress Sketch), Project Statistics and Vessel Utilization worksheets shall be submitted as one workbook to progress.sketches@noaa.gov, along with a courtesy copy to either the AHB or PHB Chief (AHB.Chief@noaa.gov or PHB.Chief@noaa.gov, in accordance with the guidance below by the fifth day of the month following survey operations. To assist in the submission of this information, at the beginning of the field season, HSD Operations Branch will provide each ship with a Monthly Report Excel file with three separate worksheets as indicated below.\nSurvey Progress Estimate \u00ad This will be used to track estimated monthly survey progress by area within a given month. It will be a spreadsheet that consists of rows showing the vessel's current project and all associated survey sheets. Column titles are self-explanatory. For each month that data is acquired on a survey sheet (as well as sheets that are still incomplete) the cumulative percentage completed through the end of that month should be entered in the spreadsheet. Any modifications to the initial survey sheet layout must be reported.\nProject Statistics \u00ad This will be used to track monthly statistics other than square nautical miles. Since each row of the spreadsheet represents a specific project within a given month, the field is advised to maintain one sheet for the entire fiscal year and submit the updated version every month. The following provides clarification of the columns within the spreadsheet:\n\u00b7 The \"LNM VBES\" (vertical beam echo sounder), \"LNM MB\" (multibeam), and \"LNM SSS' (side scan sonar) are for the purpose of reporting operations using only one sonar sensor.\n\u00b7 The \"LNM Combo\" is for reporting LNM if a combination of sensors is used., such as side scan and single beam or multibeam and side scan.\n\u00b7 The LNM above are to be subdivided between ship and launch platforms as appropriate.\n\u00b7 \"Items Investigated\" includes the number of AWOIS items or newly discovered items that require extra survey time.\n185\n\n\f\u00b7 \"Tide Gauges Installed/Removed\" and \"Bottom Samples\" are the only other stats needed from NOAA survey vessels. Contractors are still required to report Days at Sea (on site working on the project) and days (or fraction of days) lost due to weather or equipment malfunction.\nVessel Utilization Report \u00ad The purpose of this form is to collect data that will highlight the areas that are having the greatest effect on productivity and may be in need of additional resources. A brief description of the various columns is below:\n\u00b7 Comment \u00ad short description of survey activities and lost productivity.\n\u00b7 Days at Sea (DAS) \u00ad as defined by the Office of Marine and Aviation Operations (Any day in which a vessel is at sea for at least 1 hour during a 24-hour period in support of an assigned project. DAS include days of arrival and departure, times anchored (except during port calls) or hove-to drifting on the working grounds, and occasions when a survey ship (even though moored) deploys 25 percent or more of its total complement including officers and crew in field survey activities.)\n\u00b7 Transit (hours) \u00ad ship travel time from port to the project area or within the project area (i.e from one anchorage to another \u00ad does not include launch transit time between ship and survey area). Transit hours are in support of surveys but should not be counted as planned/actual survey hours.\n\u00b7 Ship/launch planned and actual survey hours - number of hours planned at the beginning of each day for each platform if all equipment is operating properly and if the authorized number of skilled personnel are available; hours planned may be increased during the day due to reflect a change in plans (e.g. late launches) but should rarely, if ever, be decreased; the number of actual hours worked for each platform. Note: actual hours can never be greater than planned hours.\n\u00b7 Vessel Utilization - percentage (rounded to the nearest decimal) of planned hours that were actually worked; this number should not be affected by time lost due to routine mechanical/electrical maintenance or safety stand down days.\n\u00b7 Weather/Safety Stand down (hours) - hours of production lost due to weather or safety stand down (divided between ship and launches)\n\u00b7 Unscheduled Maintenance or Equipment Issues (hours) - hours of production lost due to unscheduled repairs to non-survey equipment.\n\u00b7 Downtime due to Survey Equipment Issues (hours) - hours of production lost due to problems related to survey equipment.\n\u00b7 Downtime due to Personnel Shortage (hours) - hours of production lost due to shortage of personnel or shortage of personnel with requisite skill level.\nIt is understood that the determination of planned survey hours is very subjective and dependent upon numerous factors including the requirement to process acquired data in a timely fashion and the availability of vessels and personnel.\n186\n\n\f5.2.2.2.2 Data Acquisition & Processing Report (DAPR)\nA Data Acquisition and Processing Report shall be created to describe the data acquisition and processing procedures, quality control procedures, and any major deviations from OCS standard survey practices implemented throughout a project. The DAPR shall be completed in accordance with section 8.1.5.1 of the HSSD and submitted to the Chief of HSTP and the hydrographic branch that will be receiving data for the project. The DAPR should be submitted simultaneously with, or before, the first survey of the project completed that year. Note: For projects that span multiple years, a new DAPR shall be generated each calendar year. Information contained in the HSRR memo may be referenced in the DAPR to meet reporting requirements set forth in the HSSD.\n5.2.2.2.3 Horizontal & Vertical Control Report (HVCR)\nThe Horizontal and Vertical Control Report shall be completed in accordance with section 8.1.5.2 of the HSSD and submitted to the appropriate hydrographic branch before or not later than the submission of the last survey of a project. For projects that span multiple years, a new HVCR shall be generated each calendar year. No report is necessary if no HorCon and/or VerCon were conducted; however, a text document stating that no HorCon and/or VerCon operations were conducted shall be placed in this folder in lieu of an HVCR.\n5.2.2.2.4 Tide & Water Level Data Package\nField units that have installed and serviced water level stations in support of an OCS survey project shall provide the following Tide and Water Level Data Package to CO-OPS in accordance with section 4 of the HSSD. 1.

The products shall be and submitted to NSD's Coast Pilot Branch via email to OCS.NDB@ NOAA.GOV and Coast.Pilot@NOAA.GOV with a courtesy copy to the appropriate hydrographic branch and the HSD OPS project planner.\"\nCoast Pilot Reviews shall be submitted following the completion of operations within a project area, and no later than at the time of submission of the first Descriptive Report for that project. If a survey project spans multiple years, a Coast Pilot Review shall be submitted at the conclusion of operations within the affected area each field season so that edits can be reviewed and applied to the Coast Pilot prior to compilation of source data for the following field season.\n5.2.2.3 Survey Reports\n5.2.2.3.1 Descriptive Report (DR)\nFor each survey, a Descriptive Report shall be completed in accordance with section 8.1.4 of the HSSD and Chapter 5 of this manual. Information contained in the DAPR may be referenced in the DR to meet reporting requirements set forth in the HSSD.\n5.2.2.3.1.1 Pydro Chartlets\nPydro supports creation of automated \"cookie cut\" chartlets for features using OpenGL-based \"HSTP Control\" ChartWindow. From the ChartWindow context menu, select \"Screen Capture\" -> \"Auto Chartlets\". A subsequent dialog allows you to specify a feature tree template filter to control which items/features have chartlets generated (empty template implies use all features). Chartlets are saved in a user-specified directory in PNG format. The visible data content within each chartlet is as per the plot configuration as seen in the Pydro ChartWindow. The Auto Chartlets command can be executed multiple times to generate more than one chartlet view for any feature(s). Pydro automatically generates unique chartlet names, so the same output directory can be used each time\u00adno existing files will be overwritten. The Chartlets get a default caption in the Pydro PSS, listing the center position in decimal degrees and the width and height in meters of each chartlet image. PSS chartlet output is supported in all Pydro reporting options. The Pydro DTON report includes a Zip archive containing the .xml and .pdf files, as well as a DTONImages folder containing all of relevant chartlets (always included) and report images (user selectable).\n5.2.2.3.1.2 Pydro Line Classification\nPydro supports classification of HIPS/SIPS survey lines in compliance with HSSD. Lines can be classified in Pydro according to \"mode\" and \"type\". Line mode includes \"Interferometric\", \"Multibeam\", \"Shoreline\", \"SideScanSonar\", \"SingleBeam\", and \"UnclassifiedMode\"; multiple modes can be selected per line (not to include \"UnclassifiedMode\"). Line type includes \"Crossline\", \"Development\", \"Mainscheme\", \"Other\", and \"UnclassifiedType\"; only one type can be selected per line. Pydro line classification is accessible in the Data -> Stats -> \"PVDL / In Bathy Info\" and \"Survey Line Info\" dialogs. Any HIPS/SIPS survey lines can be brought into Pydro via Data -> Insert -> \"HIPS/SIPS Survey Lines\", without the added expense of inserting any associated feature or bathymetry data into the PSS. Survey line data read in this way does include the survey track and swath-bathymetry coverage limits (if any), and can therefore be used in Pydro to compute linear nautical miles\n189\n\n\f(LNM) and to index full-density PVDL depth data. The Pydro information dialogs include a versatile HIPS/SIPS PVDL-filtering engine that can be used to compute LNM for any particular line mode/type classification, for any subset of project(s), vessel(s), day(s), and line(s). Each filtering category includes a choice of the use of inclusive or exclusive logic.\n5.2.2.3.1.3 Pydro Surface-Points Comparisons\nPoint and surface data comparison statistics can be compiled and reported in Pydro via Reports -> \"Points/Surface Stats\": - Items for localized comparison points can be those as filtered using any feature tree template, not just \"Checkpoints\" - Reference surface data choices include HIPS BASE/weighted grid data, in addition to PVDL binned depth data - Reference surfaces can be filtered according to precision - Comparison point data choices include HIPS BASE/weighted grids, PVDL depths, and the localized comparison item depth data - Greater control over PDF report output: grouped summary or localized details of cumulative and/or by beam or depth bin - Option for graphs and/or tabular output; graphing options for by-beam or by-depth bin and a \"IHOness\" pie chart of surface-minus-depth pass/fail percentages - Reference surface image output options: (filtered) bathy and (filtered) precision, as well as item/feature report images and chartlets.\n5.2.2.3.2 Survey Outline\nUpon completion of data acquisition for a survey, submit a final survey outline to survey.outlines@noaa.gov in accordance with the Project Instructions and section 8.1.2 of the HSSD.\n5.2.2.3.3 Request for Tides\nWithin 24-hours of completion of data acquisition for a survey, a request for final discrete zoning (often referred to as a \"final tides request\") shall be submitted to CO-OPS. Pydro should be used to automatically generate a zipped digital \"Request for Tides\" package that contains all of the survey information needed by CO-OPS. The package includes a formal memorandum requesting approved water level data, an Abstract of Times of Hydrography, and digital *.MID and *.MIF files of survey track lines. Submit the Request for Tides package via email to final.tides@noaa.gov, with the project number referenced in the email subject line. Once this request has been received, CO-OPS has agreed to provide field units with final water level correctors relative to the appropriate chart datum and final tidal zoning, as close to \"near real-time\" as possible. Final approved water levels shall be applied to all applicable survey data before data submission to HSD. If the lack of final approved water levels delays submission of a survey, please contact the appropriate HSD Operations Branch Chief or NSD Navigation Response Branch Chief . The type of tide/water level file (predicted, preliminary, or verified) applied to submitted data shall be noted in the Corrections to Echo Soundings section of the Descriptive Report. Include a copy of the digital Request for Tides package, as well as the *CORP.tab, *STNP.tab, and *LABP.tab files applied to survey data, in Appendix I(Tides and Water Levels) of the Descriptive Report.\n5.2.2.3.4 ATON Report\nInformation for each USB assigned ATON and any additional ATONs which should be reported based on the criteria defined in section 3.5.3.3 of this manual shall be submitted to MCD at the completion of a survey. Refer Appendix 5 of the FPM for an example of the (Fixed Aton Report.pdf),created by MCD to facilitate a standardized submission.\n190\n\n\fField units shall submit an ATON Report of all ATONs investigated directly to MCD via email to aton.reports@ noaa.gov. Courtesy copies shall be provided to the Chief of the appropriate hydrographic branch and either Chief of OPS or Chief of NRB. A copy of the ATON Report and processed data record shall also be included in Appendix II (Supplemental Survey Records and Correspondence) of the Descriptive Report.\n5.2.2.3.5 Data Directory Size Report\nAfter data acquisition is complete for each survey, send an e-mail indicating the survey/project number, survey platform, raw MBES and/or VBES directory size, and raw SSS directory size to NGDC at hydro.info@noaa.gov with a copy to the chief of the appropriate processing branch.\n5.2.2.4 Public Relations and Constituent Products\nAny preliminary survey products, including public relation documents (chartlets, sounding plots, images, mosaics, DTMs, etc.) created by the field unit at the request of any parties outside of OCS (pilots, harbor masters, port authorities, other NOAA offices, etc.), that detail any surveyed information or significant discoveries made during a project are important documents that often support NOAA public relations and presence in an area. These documents can and will be used in various ways that are often unknown to the field unit that provided that product. Therefore, it is essential that each document contain a minimum amount of metadata to inform both the recipient of the document and NOAA offices of the origin and particulars of the data. A digital copy (preferably PDF) of any preliminary product delivered to a local constituent should be included with the survey deliverables.\nThe minimum elements suggested in each document are:\n1. Title bar or block (include the name of the local area in title)\n2. Date and registry number of the survey\n3. Field unit acquiring the data\n4. Type of equipment used to acquire the data (EM3002, Klein 5000, Klein 3000, Reson 7125, etc.)\n5. If a sounding plot, a statement stating: Soundings in (feet, fathoms or meters) at (MLLW, ITRF 00, etc.) corrected using (predicted tides, preliminary observed tides, verified observed tides, Vdatum, ellipsoidally referenced)\n6. A scale bar with units\n7. Legend (i.e. red=0-10 feet/fathoms, yellow=10-20 feet/fathoms, etc.)\n8. A north arrow (if applicable)\n9. Graticules (labeled Lat/Long grid)\n10. A disclaimer stating: \"Data reflect the state of the sea floor in existence on the day and at the time the survey was conducted. The survey and the chart have not been updated for inclusion of the latest Local Notice to Mariners. Preliminary data subject to office review. Not for use in navigation.\"\n11. Optional: Contact information and/or NOAA website\n191\n\n\fPrior to releasing any preliminary survey data to parties outside of OCS, personnel shall first obtain approval from the Chief-of-Party and notify the Chief of HSD OPS or Chief of NRB. In addition to the local constituent, the product shall be digitally submitted to the regional Navigation Manager and the Chief of HSD OPS or Chief of NRB in a timely fashion.\nAll supplemental correspondence, including these preliminary data products, are to be included in Appendix II of the DR. In addition to a digital copy of the product, it is prudent for the field unit to provide a copy of any correspondence referring to the product, and any of the files and workspaces used to create the product (if applicable).\n5.2.3 NODC Files\nEach time a sound speed profile is processed using Velocipy, an archive file will be automatically generated in the proper format for submission to the National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC). At the conclusion of a project, these archive files shall be submitted to HSTP. All NODC files associated with the project should be zipped into a single file and transmitted as an email attachment to NODC.Submissions@noaa.gov with a courtesy copy to the Chief of HSTP. The files will be checked by HSTP and forwarded to the NODC for inclusion in the World Ocean Database.\nBe certain to submit the archive files created by Velocipy, and not the historical NODC files used by Velocipy as a quality control tool. The NODC files to be submitted can be identified by their naming convention. The file names will indicate the cast date and time and have an extension ending in \"a\" for CTD casts and \"d\" for sound speed versus depth profilers, as shown below.\n\u00b7 Filename examples - YYDDDHHMM.ssa or YYDDDHHMM.ssd, where: \u00b7 YY = 2-digit year \u00b7 DDD = day-of-year \u00b7 HH = hour of day (UTC) \u00b7 MM= minutes of the hour \u00b7 ss = ship code\nNote: NODC files should not be included in the survey data submitted to either AHB or PHB.\n5.2.4 Transmittal Procedures\nFinal survey data submitted to either AHB or PHB should be complete and not require supplemental data from other surveys in the project. All survey data submitted shall be packaged to safeguard against loss or damage and be accompanied by a hard copy transmittal letter (NOAA Form 61-29, Letter Transmitting Data). Additionally, a digital copy of the transmittal letter(s) should be submitted via e-mail to the cognizant hydrographic branch at the time the data is transferred using either LTDSubmission.AHB@noaa.gov or LTDSubmission.PHB@noaa.gov as appropriate. If shipping more than one package, a separate transmittal should be used for each package. The transmittal letter shall indicate the contents of the package and list all digital media being submitted (e.g., tapes, portable hard drives, CD, DVD) with a detailed catalog of the data contained on each and the file name of the digital directory listing created in accordance with section 5.2.1 of this manual. If additional pages are needed for the transmittal letter, the project number and survey registry number shall be included on each page. Transmittal letters can be created in Pydro through the Reports > NOAA Forms menu, and should be signed digitally.\n192\n\n\fRaw data can be shipped to NGDC at the following address: NOAA, National Geophysical Data Center NOAA/NESDIS/NGDC/MGG 325 Broadway E/GC3 Boulder, CO 80305-6429 Attn: Manager, Hydro Database\nAll other data shall be shipped to the appropriate hydrographic branch at one of the following addresses: NOAA, National Ocean Service Atlantic Hydrographic Branch, N/CS33 439 West York Street Norfolk, Virginia 23510-1114 NOAA, National Ocean Service Pacific Hydrographic Branch, N/CS34 BIN C15700, Bldg. 3 7600 Sand Point Way N.E.

Such a chart may be a harbor chart overprinted with a series of circles, each indicating an individual anchorage.\nANGLE OF INCIDENCE The angle that a straight line acoustic pulse meeting a surface makes with a normal to the surface. The angle of incidence is important in sonar backscattering. For instance, if the sonar altitude is too low, at long ranges the angle of incidence with the seabed becomes high. Much of the incident energy is not returned to the transducer. Further, if the seabed angles up at the outer ranges, the angle of incidence becomes lower and more energy will be returned, making a notable anomaly in the data.\nAPPARENT SHORELINE The seaward limits of marine vegetation, such as mangrove, marsh grass, or trees in water that would reasonably appear to the mariner from a distance to be the fast shoreline. The seaward limits of kelp, low grass in water, and\n198\n\n\fother low-lying vegetation normally do not constitute an apparent shoreline. A line drawn on the chart in lieu of the mean high water line or the mean water level line in areas where either may be obscured by marsh, mangrove, cypress, or other type of marine vegetation.

Te waters outside the lines are COLREG waters. For specifcs concerning COLREGS Demarcation Lines, see U.S. Code of Federal Regulations, Title 33, Navigation and Navigable Waters; Part 82, COLREGS Demarcation Lines. See Inland Rules of the Road.\n210\n\n\fCOMBINED UNCERTAINTY In the context of the uncertainty of a fnalized bathymetry grid, the greater of the standard deviation (scaled to 95%) and the grid uncertainty, which is derived from the total propagated error of the soundings that contributed to that node. COMPASS MAGNETIC ERROR Te angle by which a compass direction difers from the true direction; the algebraic sum of the variation and deviation.\nCOMPASS POINTS Te 32 divisions of a compass, at intervals of 11 \u00bc\u00b0. Each division is further divided into quarter points.\nCOMPASS ROSE A circle graduated in degrees, clockwise from 0\u00b0 at the reference direction to 360\u00b0, and sometimes also in compass points. Compass roses are placed at convenient locations on the nautical chart or plotting sheet to facilitate measurement of direction.\nCOMPILATION Te production of a new or revised map or chart, or portions thereof, from existing maps, aerial photographs, survey and other data, and other sources.

Tey have common boundaries and are not separated by foreign territory or the high seas.\nCONTIGUOUS ZONE 1. A zone seaward of the territorial sea in which coastal states may assert jurisdiction short of complete sovereignty. Article 24 of the Convention on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone authorizes such a zone \"to prevent\n211\n\n\finfringement of its customs, fscal, immigration or sanitary regulations in territory or territorial sea.. . . \" Under the Convention, the contiguous area may extend no more than 12 miles from the coast line. 2. Te belt of high seas, 9 nautical miles wide, that is adjacent to and seaward of the territorial seas of the United States and that was declared to exist in Department of State Public Notice 358 of June 1, 1972, FR 11906.\nCONTINENTAL MARGIN Te zone, generally consisting of shelf, slope, and rise, separating the continent from the abyssal plain or deep sea bottom.\nCONTINENTAL RISE A gentle slope rising from the oceanic depths toward the foot of a continental slope.\nCONTINENTAL SHELF Te submerged portion of a continent which slopes gently (average slope of less than 1:100) seaward from the low-water line to a point where a substantial break in grade occurs, at which point the bottom slopes seaward at a considerable increase in slope (typically exceeding 1:40) until the great ocean depths are reached. Te point of break defnes the \"edge\" of the shelf, and the steeper sloping bottom the continental slope. Conventionally, the edge is taken at 100 fm (or 200 m), but instances are known where the increase in slope occurs at more than 200 fm or less than 65 fm. Alternate juridical (legal) defnition: Under the UN Conference on Law of the Sea, Article 76, the continental shelf of a coastal State comprises the seabed and subsoil of the submarine areas that extend beyond its territorial sea throughout the natural prolongation of its land territory to the outer edge of the continental margin, or to a distance of 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured where the outer edge of the continental margin does not extend up to that distance.\nUnder certain circumstances a coastal State may submit a claim for an extension of its continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles.\nCONTINENTAL SLOPE Te relatively steep descent from the edge of the continental shelf to the deep-sea foor, usually a very irregular area.\nCONTINUOUSLY OPERATING REFERENCE STATIONS (CORS) A network of continuously operating stations operated by the National Geodetic Survey that provide Global Positioning System (GPS) carrier phase and code range measurements in support of 3-dimensional positioning activities throughout the United States and its territories.\nCONTOUR A line joining points of equal vertical distance above or below a datum.

Te least depth in the approach or channel to an area, such as a port or anchorage, governing the maximum draf of vessels that can enter. See Federal Project Depth. 2. Te least depth within the limits of a channel; it restricts the\n212\n\n\fsafe use of the channel to drafs of less than that depth. Te centerline controlling depth of a channel applies only to the channel centerline; lesser depths may exist in the remainder of the channel. Te mid-channel controlling depth of a channel is the controlling depth only for the middle half of the channel.\nCONTROL STATION A point on the ground whose horizontal or vertical location is used as a basis for obtaining locations of other points.\nCONVENTIONAL CHARTS Flat, printed reproductions published by NOAA of some portion of the navigational part of the Earth's surface. Depending on their scale, these charts show the nature and shape of the coast, depth of the water, general confguration and character of the bottom, prominent landmarks, port facilities, cultural details, dredged channels, aids to navigation, marine hazards, magnetic variations, and seaward boundaries. Changes brought about by people and nature require that nautical charts be constantly maintained to aid safe navigation. NOAA's area of responsibility includes the national and territorial coastal waters of the United States, including the Great Lakes, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, U.S. Trust Territories, and other islands in the Atlantic and Pacifc Oceans.\nCONVENTION ON THE TERRITORIAL SEA AND THE CONTIGUOUS ZONE One of the four Conventions on the law of the sea adopted at Geneva in 1958 which, among other things, sets out principles for establishing the baseline from which maritime zones of jurisdiction will be measured. 15 U.S.T 1606. Tose principles were later adopted by the United States Supreme Court for purposes of implementing the Submerged Lands Act, 43 U.S.C 1301 et seq. Sometimes referred to herein simply as \"the Convention.\"\nCOORDINATED UNIVERSAL TIME (UTC) A \"time\" referencing term which supersedes, but is generally equivalent to, Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). Te new UTC time scale is almost perfectly constant, since it is based on stable atomic clocks. GMT is based upon a form of solar time-keeping and is approximately the same as UTC. See Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). UTC is a time scale that is based on the second (SI), as defned and recommended by the CCIR (International Radio Consultative Committee, of the International Telecommunications Union), and maintained by the Bureau International des Poids et Measures (BIPM). For most practical purposes associated with the Radio Regulations, UTC is equivalent to mean solar time at the prime meridian (0\u00b0 longitude), formerly expressed in GMT. Te maintenance by BIPM includes cooperation among various national laboratories around the world. Adjustments to the atomic, i.e., the UTC, time scale consist of an occasional addition or deletion of 1 full second, which is called a leap second. Twice yearly, during the last minute of the day of June 30 and of December 31, Universal Time, adjustments may be made. Historically, adjustments, when necessary, have usually consisted of adding an extra second to the UTC time scale in order to allow the rotation of the Earth to \"catch up.\" Terefore, the last minute of the UTC time scale, on the day when an adjustment is made, will have 59 or 61 seconds. UTC is also called World Time, Z Time, Zulu Time.\nCOORDINATES Linear or angular quantities which designate the position of a point in relation to a given reference system.\nCORAL Hard calcareous skeletons of many tribes of marine polyps. In the strict sense, a bottom-dwelling marine organism which secretes an external skeleton of calcium carbonate and which frequently forms large, irregularly shaped colonies with numerous coral heads and pinnacles. Coral formations usually consist of a mixture of coral and other marine organisms, along with other debris and chemically precipitated rock. For shoreline mapping purposes, a coral formation is a naturally occurring, consolidated mass of hard calcareous matter which is too large to be adequately represented on the shoreline map by a single rock (coral) symbol. Tese formations include masses of irregular shape, as well as those relatively fat, ledge type features that may fringe a shore.\n213\n\n\fCORAL HEAD A massive mushroom- or pillar-shaped coral growth.\nCORAL REEF A reef consisting of coral, fragments of coral, and other marine organisms consolidated together so as to form a massive structure.\nCORS See Continuously Operating Reference Stations.\nCOVE A small, sheltered recess in a coast, ofen inside a larger embayment.\nCOVERS/UNCOVERS An expression used to indicate an area of a reef or other projection from the bottom of a body of water which periodically extends above and is submerged below the surface. See also Awash.\nCRIB A permanent marine structure usually designed to support or elevate pipelines; especially a structure enclosing a screening device at the ofshore end of a potable water intake pipe. Te structure is commonly a heavy timber enclosure that has been sunken with rocks or other debris.\nCRIT Informal name for the critical corrections database that is used in the Update Service Branch. Te CRIT database was started in 1991 and includes all corrections from the LNM and NM and Canadian Notice. It is used by all cartographers and is a major research tool as well as application history.\nCRITICAL SURVEY AREA Per the NOAA Hydrographic Survey Priorities document, critical survey areas are defned as waterways with high commercial trafc volumes (cargo, fshing vessels, cruise ships, ferries, etc., extensive petroleum or hazardous material transport, compelling requests from users, and/or transiting vessels with low under-keel clearance over the seafoor. Approximately 43,000 square nautical miles of critical survey areas were identifed in 1994 by NOAA and given the highest priority for hydrographic survey. New areas are continuously being identifed as critical based on changing usage and are designated as emerging critical areas.\nCROSSLINES Sounding lines that cross the main system of survey lines at either right angles or at an oblique angle. Cross line data is acquired, processed, and evaluated as a system check. Crosslines are not an accuracy test or assessment, but a system check comparing data from diferent times and diferent line azimuths or directions.\nCULTURAL FEATURE A feature delineated on a survey, map, or chart which represent objects either constructed by, or resulting from the actions of man, e.g., shipwrecks, roads, buildings, canals, piers, etc.\nCUPOLA A small dome-shaped tower or turret rising from a building.\nCUPPING/FROWNING (SVP) A sound speed profle artifact exhibited in MBES data either as a concave or smiling swath (cupping) and convex or frowning swath\n214\n\n\f7.4 D\nDANGER LINE 1. A line drawn on a chart to indicate the limits of safe navigation for a vessel of specifc draf. 2. A line of small dots used to draw the navigator's attention to a danger which would not stand out clearly enough if it were represented on the chart solely by the specifc symbols. Te line of small dots is also used to delimit areas containing numerous dangers, through which it is unsafe to navigate.\nDANGEROUS WRECK A wreck either visible or submerged at such a depth as to be considered a danger to navigation with respect to local vessel trafc. See derelict and wreck.\nDANGER TO NAVIGATION (DTON) Any feature, e.g., a wreck, obstruction, depth, or condition deemed to constitute a potential risk to mariners. Advisory information is published by the U. S. Coast Guard in the Local Notice to Mariners and by National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) in the Notice to Mariners.\nDAPR See Data Acquisition and Processing Report. DATA General term used to denote facts, numbers, letters, and symbols. Te basic elements of information; usually but not always expressed in numerical form.\nDATA ACQUISITION AND PROCESSING REPORT A project-wide survey report that is separated into three sections: Equipment, Quality Control, and Corrections to Echo Soundings. Refer to NOS Specifcations and Deliverables, June 2006 Edition.\nDATA FLIERS Erroneous data points that could be the result of noise interference within the water column, operational parameters or settings such as TVG (time varied gain), pulse widths, pulse lengths, power and/or gain levels.\nDATAGRAM A discrete package of data and headers which contain addresses (which is the basic unit of transmission across an IP network). Also called a `packet'.\nDATUM Any numerical or geometrical quantity or set of such quantities which may serve as a reference or base for other quantities. In geodesy a datum is defned by a set of parameters specifying the reference surface or the reference coordinate system. Terefore, two types of datums are required: a horizontal datum which forms the basis for computations of horizontal control surveys and a vertical datum to which elevations or depths are referred.\nDATUM CORRECTION Te correction (in latitude and longitude) that must be applied to the projection lines on a survey sheet or chart to transform it to a diferent datum.\nDATUM PLANE A vertical control datum. Although a level surface is not a plane, the vertical control datum is frequently referred to as the datum plane.\nDAYBEACON An unlighted structure which serves as a daytime aid to navigation by virtue of its distinctive appearance which makes it recognizable and identifable.\n215\n\n\fDAY OF YEAR A sequential numbering system starting with 001 on January 1 of each year and ending with 365, or 366 in leap years, on December 31 of that year. DOY is ofen incorrectly referred to as Julian Day.\nDAYMARK Te identifying characteristics of an aid to navigation, unique and distinctive to facilitate its daytime recognition. Also, a conspicuous target added to a daybeacon or light.\nDEADHEAD A submerged or barely awash log or tree trunk freely foating at varying attitudes, in contrast to the plane formed by the still undisturbed surface of the water. At times, one end of a deadhead may become temporarily attached to the bottom with the opposite (unattached) end foating in a pivotal or vertical manner due to the action of waves and/or currents.\nDEAD RECKONING A method of navigation that has been historically used in hydrographic surveying to control the position of the survey ship beyond the range of control stations, and to supplement astronomic observations. Te position is determined by applying the ship's run to the last well-determined position, using the course steered and the distance traveled by the log.\nDEADWEIGHT DEPRESSOR A heavy, inert weight used to increase towfsh depth when attached to the tow cable. When using long lengths of in-water cable, such as when towing lightweight towfsh in depths greater than 100 m, drag forces on the cable ofen prevent the towbody from descending to the required depth. Slower tow speeds or greater downward pull at the towbody are required. Although deadweight depressors are more straightforward in application than hydrodynamic depressors, they should be streamlined and rigged as to be tangle-free during and afer deployment. Te use of deadweights also requires greater overside lifing capacity than with hydrodynamic depressors.\nDECIBEL A logarithmic measurement unit that describes a sound's relative loudness, though it can also be used to describe the relative diference between two power levels. A decibel (dB) is one tenth of a Bel. In sound, decibels generally measure a scale from 0 (the threshold of hearing) to 120-140 dB (the threshold of pain). A 3dB diference equates to a doubling of power. A dB is a unit of measure of signal strength, usually the relation between a transmitted signal and a standard signal source. Every 3 dB = 50% of signal strength.\nDECONFLICT Te process of reconciling conficting information based on the age of the information, reliability of the source, etc.\nDELTA Te low alluvial land, deposited in a more or less triangular form at the mouth of a river, which is ofen cut by several tributaries of the main stream.\nDEMARCATION LINE A line through the high seas marking the allocation of territory between two countries, rather than a boundary line; for example, the line through the Bering Strait and Bering Sea between Russia and Alaska.\nDENSITY OF SOUNDINGS Intervals between lines of soundings and soundings within the same line. Density of soundings depends heavily on the scale and nature of the survey and type of sounding equipment used.\n216\n\n\fDENSITY OF WATER Mass per unit volume. Te reciprocal of specifc volume. In oceanography, the density of sea water is numerically equivalent to specifc gravity and is a function of salinity, temperature, and pressure.\nDEPRESSION CONTOUR A closed contour delimiting an area of lower elevation than the surrounding terrain. Directional ticks extend from the contour in a downhill direction.\nDEPRESSOR An attachment to a sonar tow cable or towed body that assists in increasing the depths of the towed body; commonly of two types, deadweight and hydrodynamic. Te depressor allows the user to bring a sonar towbody within an optimum altitude above the seabed. Although lower tow speeds also assist in lowering a towfsh, speeds below 1 1.5 knots may produce towbody instability such as kiting and yaw, resulting in data distortions.\nDEPTH Te vertical distance from a given water level to the seafoor, lake or river bottom.\nDEPTH CONTOUR NAVIGATION A method of position determination by utilizing the depth curves on the nautical chart. Consists in ftting a series of observed echo soundings to the depth curves. Te line of soundings is ftted to the depth contours by moving it so that it remains parallel to the true course steered.\nDEPTH CURVES A line on a map, smooth sheet, or nautical chart drawn in accordance with prescribed conventions and generally connecting points of equal depth at or below a specifed datum. Te line is sometimes signifcantly displaced outside of soundings, symbols, and other chart detail for clarity as well as generalization. Depth curves therefore ofen represent an approximate location of the line of equal depth as related to the surveyed line delineated on the source.\nDEPTH UNITS Te units (fathoms, feet, meters) in which the soundings are plotted on the smooth sheet or on the nautical chart. On early surveys, two depth units were generally used on one survey, but with no uniform dividing line (see Registry Nos. H-1 (1837) and H-336 (1852)).\nDERELICT A vessel or any property abandoned and afoat within navigable waters and thereby constituting a real or potential danger to navigation.\nDESCRIPTIVE REPORT (DR) A written report that accompanies every topographic and hydrographic survey for the purpose of supplementing it with information that cannot be shown graphically thereon, and to direct attention to important results.\nDETACHED POSITION (DP) A discrete geographic position observed and recorded at a specifc location. Te position is \"detached\" from the main scheme of hydrographic sounding lines. Rocks, wrecks, obstructions, aids to navigation, etc., are typically the sort of features subject to this type of positioning.\nDETECTABILITY Te size, shape and makeup of a seabed anomaly, as related to a sonar's ability to discern its existence. Detection occurs when excess energy is returned to the sonar transducer from a target or discontinuity. When a target\n217\n\n\freturns this excess energy from only one of many pings, the system will detect the target but the operator may not recognize it in the data. Some modern sonar data processors are assisting the user in narrowing the gap between detection and recognition with separate graphic displays of the amplitude of individual return signals. See Recognition.\nDEVIATION Te angle between the magnetic meridian and the axis of a compass card, expressed in degrees east or west to indicate the direction in which the northern end of the compass card is ofset from magnetic north. Deviation is caused by disturbing magnetic infuences in the immediate vicinity of the compass, as within the craf.\nDEVIATION OF COMPASS Te defection of the needle of a magnetic compass due to masses of magnetic metal within a ship on which the compass is located. Tis defection varies with diferent headings of the ship. Te deviation is called easterly and marked plus (+) if the defection is to the right of magnetic north, and is called westerly and marked minus (-) if it is to the lef of magnetic north. A deviation table is a tabular arrangement showing the amount of deviation for diferent headings of the ship. Each compass requires a separate deviation table.\nDIFFERENTIAL GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM (DGPS) Diferential Global Positioning System (DGPS) is an enhancement Global Positioning System that uses a network of fxed ground based reference stations to broadcast the diference between the positions indicated by the satellite systems and the known fxed positions. Tese stations broadcast the diference between the measured satellite pseudoranges and actual (internally computed) pseudoranges, and receiver stations may correct their pseudoranges by the same amount. Diferential corrections can be applied in either real time or post-processing.\nDIFFERENTIATION Te process of using separate but identical navigational instruments where one is fxed at a known location and provides, via radio link, a second mobile instrument with ofset calculations. Tis process is used to increase the accuracy of certain navigational instruments that may be afected by diurnal or atmospheric variations, such as LORAN, and those with inherent errors, such as GPS.\nDIGITAL CARTOGRAPHIC FEATURE FILE (DCFF or CFF) National Geodetic Survey's deliverable fle that stores geometry and attribute information for spatial features in a vector data set. Te previous fle formats included Standard Digital Data Exchange Format and ArcInfo Interchange fle (E00). Te current format is the ESRI Shapefle using the Coastal Cartographic Object Attribute Source Table (C-COAST) attribution schema.\nDIGITAL MAP (DM) Te National Geodetic Survey's Coastal Mapping Program's series identifer for shoreline data contained within the Digital Cartographic Feature File (DCFF) used from 1990 to 1999. Te fle identifers consisted of two alpha and fve numeric characters. Te alpha characters were DM, which refect Digital Map while the numbers ranged from DM10000 to DM10404.\nDIGITAL TERRAIN MODEL A surface, typically land or seafoor, represented in digital form by an elevation grid or lists of three-dimensional coordinates.\nDIKE A bank of earth or stone used to form a barrier, frequently and confusingly interchanged with levee. A dike restrains water within an area that is normally fooded.\n218\n\n\fDILUTION OF POSITION (DOP) A measure of the geometry of the satellites seen by the receiver. DOP relates the statistical accuracy of the satellite measurements to the statistical accuracy of the computed solution. Position Dilution of Precision (PDOP) is a common measure, composed of Horizontal Dilution of Precision (HDOP) and Vertical Dilution of Precision (VDOP). Geometric Dilution of Precision (GDOP) is composed of Time Dilution of Precision (TDOP) and PDOP. Te larger the DOP, the less accurate the measurement.\nDIPFILE An automated Discrete Independent Point File once maintained within NOAA's nautical chart program which listed charting sources and geographic positions of cartographic features, such as navigational aids, landmarks, wrecks, and obstructions. Elements of the DIPFILE were/are being used in the initial encoding of Electronic Navigational Charts.\nDIRECTION In surveying and mapping, the angle between a line or plane and an arbitrarily chosen reference line or plane.\nDIRECTION LIGHT A light illuminating a sector of very narrow angle and intended to mark a direction to be followed. A direction light bounded by other sectors of diferent characteristics which defne its margins with small angles of uncertainty is called a single station range light.\nDISCOLORED WATER Unnatural colored areas in the sea due to the existence of shoals. Sea water having a color other than the blues and greens normally seen. Variations of the colors red, yellow, green, and brown, as well as black and white, have been reported. Discolorations may appear in patches, streaks, or large areas, and may be caused by concentrations of inorganic or organic particles or plankton.\nDISCONTINUITY In NOAA hydrography, a change in the make-up of a body of water that causes a change in the speed and/or direction of sound propagation, of an incident sonar pulse. In contrast to an anomaly, which is usually distinct and separate within the environment, discontinuities are ofen widespread and difcult to discern as distinct. Tese include haline changes in the water, aerated or cavitated bodies of water, and thermoclines.\nDISPOSAL AREA Area designated by the Corps of Engineers for depositing dredged material, where existing depths indicate that the intent is not to cause sufcient shoaling to create a danger to surface navigation. Disposal areas are shown on nautical charts.

A pier is sometimes erroneously called a dock.\nDOLPHIN A mooring post or bufer placed at the entrance of a dock, alongside a wharf, or in the middle of a stream. In the frst and second instances it is used as a bufer. In the third, it is used as a mooring post by vessels which discharge their cargoes without going alongside a dock or wharf. Each dolphin is generally composed of a series of heavy\n219\n\n\fpiles contiguous to one another. Tey are arranged in a circle, brought together, and capped over the top.\nDOME A large rounded hemispherical structure rising from a building or a roof of the same shape.\nDOP See Dilution of Position.\nDOPPLER POSITION SYSTEM A positioning system consisting of a radio receiver at the point whose coordinates are to be determined, one or more beacons in orbit about the Earth, and a computing system for determining the orbits of the beacons. Te diference between the frequency of a radio wave as received and its frequency as transmitted from the beacon is a function of the radial velocity of the source with respect to the receiver. Given the ephemeris of the beacon, the coordinates of the receiver can be calculated from measurements of the diference in frequency.\nDOUBTFUL SOUNDING A depth shown on a chart over a shoal, a rock, etc., that may be less than that indicated, the position not being in doubt.\nDOWNSAMPLING Te process of reducing the number of data points in a data set, generally by keeping shoaler soundings when they are near deeper soundings. DP See Detached Position. DR See Descriptive Report.\nDRAFT Te vertical distance, at any section of a vessel from the surface of the water to the bottom of the keel. When measured at or near the stem, it is referred to as draf forward and when measured at or near the stern as draf af. For a hydrographers, draf refers to the vertical distance from the surface of the water to the transducer face.\nDRAG Te hydrodynamic forces exerted on the components of a body in contact with a moving fuid. In the case of a towed assembly, drag tends to reduce its forward motion.\nDREDGED CHANNEL An artifcially maintained sea lane extending from an inland water body into the marginal sea to accommodate vessel trafc through coastal shallows.\nDRY DOCK An artifcial basin ftted with gate or caisson into which a vessel may be foated and from which the water may be pumped out to expose the bottom of the vessel.\nDRYING HEIGHTS Heights above chart sounding datum of those features which are periodically covered and exposed by the rise and fall of the tide.\nDTM See Digital Terrain Model.\nDTON See Danger to Navigation.\n220\n\n\fDUCK BLIND For agency charting purposes, a duck blind is a non-foating structure, used for concealing waterfowl hunters, usually consisting of a wooden framework covered with brush. Tey pose a special problem for the cartographer. Tey are essentially unreported to any charting authority when built. Tey are unlighted and ofen constructed in navigable water without regard to the possible hazard they pose, especially to the small craf operator. Many are substantial structures built on piles. Even afer they are eventually reduced to ruins the pilings may persist for years.\nDUMPING GROUNDS Although shown on nautical charts as dumping grounds in U.S. waters, the federal regulations for these areas have been revoked and their use for dumping discontinued. Tese areas will continue to be shown on nautical charts until such time as they are no longer considered to be a danger to navigation.\nDUMP SITE Area established by federal regulation in which dumping of dredged and fll material and other non-buoyant objects is allowed with the issuance of a permit. Dump sites are shown on nautical charts.\n7.5 E\nEARTH CENTERED, EARTH FIXED (ECEF) A Cartesian coordinate system beginning at the Earth's center of mass.

ENC's are standardized as to content, structure and format and may contain supplementary nautical information useful for safe navigation.\nELECTRONIC POSITIONING SYSTEM A positioning system in which the travel time or phase shif of radio waves from fxed points on land was measured. Short range systems measured travel time of a direct wave using an ultra high frequency (UHF) signal. Medium range systems measured phase shif of a ground wave that utilized a much lower frequency. Tese systems were essentially made obsolete by the advent of GPS in the 1990's.\nELEVATION MASK An adjustable feature of GPS receivers that specifes a satellite must be a certain number of degrees above the horizon before its signals are used for positioning. Satellites at low elevation angles (fve degrees or less) have lower signal strengths and are more prone to loss of lock, thus causing noisy solutions.\nELEVATION Te vertical distance of natural and artifcial objects above an adopted reference plane. On nautical/navigational charts the elevations of bare rocks, bridges, landmarks, and lights are referenced to the plane of mean high water; contour and summit elevations are referenced to mean sea level, if the source for such information is referenced to this plane.\nELLIPSOID (or Reference Spheroid) A mathematical fgure generated by the revolution of an ellipse about one of its axes. Te ellipsoid that approximates the geoid is an ellipse rotated about its minor axis. An ellipsoid serves as the mathematical model from which maps and charts are produced. However, numerous ellipsoids have been developed to support local datums. Te use of the WGS 84 ellipsoid provides a single standard of reference within the Department of Defense. Also called spheroid of reference, or ellipsoid of reference. See Geoid, Oblate Spheroid, Reference Spheroid.\nELLIPTICITY OF THE SPHEROID Te ratio of the diference between the equatorial (a) and polar (b) radii of the earth (major and minor semi-axes of the spheroid) and its equatorial radius, or (a-b)/a. Also called fattening of the earth.\nEMBANKMENT An artifcial deposit of material that is raised above the natural surface of the land and used to contain, divert, or store water, to support roads or railways, or for other similar purposes.\nEMBAYMENT Any indentation of a coast, regardless of width, at the entrance or depth of penetration into the land.\n222\n\n\fENC VIEWER Sofware capable of viewing S-57 format ENC fles, i.e., CARIS Easy ENC, Seven C's, etc.\nENSONIFY To expose an area, or portion of seabed, to acoustic energy. Seabed that has been covered by sonar, is said to have been ensonifed. Ping rates (numbers of output pulses per second) are ofen referred to as \"ensonifcation rates.\"\nEPHEMERIS Te set of parameters used by a global navigation satellite receiver to predict the location of a satellite and its clock behavior. Each satellite contains and transmits ephemeris data about its own orbit and clock. Ephemeris data is more accurate than the almanac data, but is applicable over a short time frame from 4 - 6 hr.\nEQUIDISTANT MULTIBEAM SONAR SCANNING MODE Te equidistant mode electronically forms the center of each footprint at a uniform distance from each other across the swath width. Tis even sampling of across the swath width reduces the amount of overlapping coverage and intensity of returns in the inner half of the swath in efort to improve resolution in the outer beams. Tis is not recommended for hazard investigation surveys because the weak, lower resolution inner beams. Another disadvantage of this mode is that it reduces the received signal aperture of the outer beams thus reducing the possibility of detecting distant returns.\nEQUIANGULAR MULTIBEAM SONAR SCANNING MODE Te equiangular mode electronically forms the receiving beams in equal angles. Tis means in the outer beams the beam footprint increases in length across-track providing bottom coverage across the entire swath width. Te advantage of this mode is the overlapping coverage of the inner half of the swath, excellent for hazard investigation surveys where precise measurements of small targets are necessary. Te primary disadvantage is the lower resolution in the outer beams. To maintain equal resolution across an entire survey area survey lines must be planned for at 100% overlap (outer beam matching the nadir of the adjacent lines).\nESTIMATED POSITION Te most probable position of a craf determined by incomplete data or data of questionable accuracy. Such a position might be determined by applying a correction to the dead reckoning position.\nESTUARY An embayment of the coast in which fresh river water entering at its head mixes with the relatively saline ocean water. When tidal action is the dominant mixing agent it is usually termed a tidal estuary. Also, the lower reaches and mouth of a river emptying directly into the sea where tidal mixing takes place. Te latter is sometimes called a river estuary.\nEVALUATION REPORT Te successor to the Verifer's Report, with format and content essentially unchanged. See also Review and Review Report.\nEVENT MARK A mark or notation put on a sonar record, or embedded in stored data, representing the moment of a navigational fx or other critical occurrence during a survey. Event marks are important in assessing progress of a survey and in tying navigation logs to sonar data. Modern computer data processors which geo-code every sonar ping have simplifed the practice of manual log keeping, but event marks are still important as progress references and datarelated geodetic markers.\n223\n\n\fEXCLUSIVE ECONOMIC ZONE (EEZ) An area, not exceeding 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured, subject to a specifc legal regime established in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea under which the coastal state has certain rights and jurisdictions.\nEXISTENCE DOUBTFUL Of uncertain existence.

Usually shown by the abbreviation \"E.D.\"\n7.6 F\nF SURVEY See Field Examination.\nFAIRWAY Tat part of a river, harbor, etc., where the main navigable channel for vessels of larger size is located. Te usual course followed by vessels entering or leaving harbor. Also called ship channel. Te word \"fairway' has been generally interpreted to include any navigable water on which vessels of commerce habitually move, and therefore, embraces the water inside channel buoys where light-draf vessels frequently navigate and not merely the ship channel itself.\nFALSE ORIGIN A fxed point to the south and west of a grid zone from which grid distances are measured eastward and northward. Also called a grid origin.\nFAST LAND Land inshore of the inner edge of a marsh; usually at or above the plane of mean high water.\nFAST SHORELINE Te line appearing on a shoreline map that separates water from fast, natural uplands. Tis line should not be confused with the approximate back limits of marsh or marine vegetation which is normally compiled shoreward from an apparent shoreline and in lieu of the fast shoreline.\nFATHOGRAM A graphic record of depth measurements obtained by a Fathometer. Frequently, the term is improperly used to refer to an echogram.\nFATHOM A unit of length equal to 6 f (1.82880 m), and used principally as a measure of depth of water.\nFATHOMETER Copyrighted trade name for a type of single beam echo sounder.

See Cartographic Feature.\n224\n\n\fFEDERAL PROJECT A navigation channel or maintenance dredging activity of any nature and for any purpose that is to be performed by or for the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE).\nFEDERAL PROJECT DEPTH Te design dredging depth of a channel constructed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE); the project depth may or may not be the goal of maintenance dredging afer completion of the channel. For this reason federal project depth must not be confused with controlling depth.\nFETCH Te distance along open water or land over which the wind blows; the distance traversed by waves without obstruction.\nFIELD EDIT Te process of on-site examinations and measurements designed to ensure that detail and nomenclature, as portrayed or described on a previously compiled document, is current, reliable, and adequate for its intended purpose. Te purpose of these documents, which may have been in graphic or tabulated form, was to provide data for the nautical charting program.\nFIELD EXAMINATION (FE) Hydrographic surveys intended to cover only limited areas. Each survey is assigned a unique registry number the format of which has varied over time. Te original form was F.E. No. (consecutive number by year) (year), for example, F.E. No. 5 1945. Tis format was revised in 1980 to FE-(consecutive number), for example, FE-112. Te format was later revised to its present form, F(consecutive number), for example, F0025.\nFIELD POSITION An unadjusted, geographic position of a point on the earth, computed while feld work is in progress to determine the acceptability of the observations or to provide a preliminary position for other purposes.\nFIELD SHEET Te system CARIS HIPS and SIPS uses for organizing data products created from cleaned and processed bathymetry and side scan data. Te feld sheet consists of a data directory with a feld sheet defnition fle and a CARIS fle for storing vector products. Te defnition fle contains information about the geographic boundary of the feld sheet and the coordinate system to be used for the data products. (Former use: Te hydrographer's or topographer's work sheet; the feldsheet presents a graphic display of all surface and subsurface features in the area.)\nFIGURE OF THE EARTH Te defning elements of the mathematical surface which approximates the surface of the geoid. Te fgure of the earth has been proved to be approximately an oblate spheroid. See also Geoid and Spheroid.\nFILE TRANSFER PROTOCOL (FTP) Method of transferring usually large fles across network connections.\nFINAL WATER LEVEL CORRECTORS Verifed 6-minute water levels (see Verifed Water Levels) for which CO-OPS has provided fnal discrete zoning.

Te frst bottom return is utilized by many sonar systems to determine fsh height (altitude), which is important in the algorithms used for range compression correction. In uncorrected data, the operator will use the frst bottom return as a measure of fsh height for winch in/out commands to maintain proper towing altitudes. Tis feature of the sonar display will be very strong in hard bottom or over a rocky substrate, but may be difcult to discern over a mud or silt seabed.\nFIRST SURFACE RETURN Te component of a side scan sonar record representing the shortest acoustic path between the towfsh and the surface directly above the towfsh. Because the vertical beamwidth is very wide in side scan sonar, some of the acoustic energy propagates upwards from the transducer. Although this energy is very low level, the sea surface can be a good refector and return enough of the incident pulse to be noticeable in data. As the fsh is lowered, the frst surface return moves, in the water column portion of the record, away from the centerline. In shallow water operations, as the fsh is lowered past the half-depth point, this return becomes lost in the near range data. Beyond this it may not be discernible because of its low signal strength. In shallow water, when the frst surface return crosses the frst bottom return, the towfsh is halfway between the surface and the seabed.\nFISH HAVEN An area established by private interests, usually sport fshermen, to simulate natural reefs and wrecks that attract fsh. Te reefs are constructed by dumping assorted material in areas which may be of very small extent or may stretch a considerable distance along a depth contour. Fish havens have defned authorized boundaries and minimum clearances, both of which are shown on nautical charts.\nFISH HEIGHT Te distance between a side scan sonar towfsh and the seabed, usually measured in feet or meters.\nFISH TRAP A device for catching fsh. It usually consists of stakes and nets arranged such that fsh entering are prevented from exiting.\nFISH TRAP AREA An area established by the Corps of Engineers in which traps may be built and maintained according to established regulations. Te fsh stakes which may exist in these areas are obstructions to navigation and may be dangerous. Te limits of fsh trap areas and a cautionary note are usually charted.\nFIX A position determined without reference to any former position. In concept, a fx is the common intersection of two or more lines of position obtained from simultaneous observations not dependent upon any former position. In normal practice, a fx is the most probable position derived from 2 or more intersecting lines of position obtained from observations made at nearly the same time.\nFJORD A long narrow arm of the sea, usually formed by the entrance of the sea into a deep glacial trough.\n226\n\n\fFLASHING LIGHT A light in which the total duration of light in a period is shorter than the total duration of darkness and appearances of light (fashes) are usually of equal duration.\nFLATS A place covered with water too shallow for navigation with vessels ordinarily used for commercial purposes; the space between high- and low-water marks along the edge of an arm of the sea, a bay, tidal river, etc.\nFLIERS Outliers.

A foating dock is a platform or ramp supported by pontoons. Tese are usually joined to the shore with a ramp that rests upon the dock on rollers, to adjust for the vertical movement of the dock. Te dock is usually held in place by vertical poles embedded in the soil under the water or by anchored cables. 2. A form of dry dock consisting of a foating structure of one or more sections which can be partly submerged by controlled fooding to receive a vessel, then raised by pumping out the water so that the vessel's bottom can be exposed.\nFLOOD Te movement of a tidal current toward the shore or up a tidal river or estuary.\nFOLIO CHARTS NOS charts consisting of two to four sheets printed front and back, folded, and bound in a protective cardboard jacket.\nFOOTPRINT Te area of seabed ensonifed by an outgoing sonar beam during, or afer, a specifc period of time. A smaller footprint of sonar on the seabed will result in a higher resolution image in the data.\nFORELAND A cape or peninsula.\nFORESHORE Tat part of the shore lying between the crest of the seaward berm (or the upper limit of wave wash at high tide) and the ordinary low-water mark According to riparian law, the strip of land between the high- and low-water marks that is alternatively covered and uncovered by the fow of the tide.\nFORMLINE Broken lines resembling contour lines but representing no actual elevations, which have been sketched from visual observation or from inadequate or unreliable map sources, to show collectively the shape of the terrain rather than the elevation.\n227\n\n\fFOUL AREA 1. An area where numerous hazards to navigation may cause damage to vessels entering or transiting the area.\n2. An area in which hazardous rocks or other obstructions are too numerous to be located individually during a hydrographic survey or cartographically depicted individually. Such areas shall be delimited by a surveyed dashed line. Unless annotated otherwise, a note \"foul\" within such a delimited area will be construed as foul with rocks. Te term \"foul\" should not be applied to a sof continuum with indefnite boundaries such as mud or sand; to areas congested with marine vegetation such as kelp or grass in water; or to materials not likely to cause damage to a vessel.\nFOUL BERTH A berth in which a vessel cannot swing to her anchor or moorings without fouling another vessel or striking an obstruction.\nFOUL BOTTOM A hard, uneven, rocky, or obstructed bottom having poor holding qualities for anchors, or one having rocks or wreckage that would endanger an anchored or transiting vessel.\nFOUL GROUND An area where the holding qualities for an anchor are poor, or where danger of striking or fouling the ground or other obstructions exist. Examples would be areas strewn with rocks, boulders, coral or obstructions.\nFRINGING ISLANDS A series of islands that fringe, or mask, a mainland coast. Ofen known as barrier islands.\nFRINGING REEF A reef attached to and paralleling a shore.\n7.7 G\nGAIN A measure of the increase in signal amplitude produced by an amplifer. In sonar applications, gains are most ofen applied in two ways. One is time-varied-gain (TVG), where signal amplifcation increases as a function of time. Tis methodology can be applied because there is a constant speed of sound underwater for most sonar applications and the returning signal level from the seabed decreases as the pulse travels across the seabed and away from the transducer. Closer returns have a far higher intensity than distant ones. Te other method of increasing gains in sonar is to apply them to the display only. In hard copy recorders, printer gain will darken the record, and with computerized sonar processors, increasing video intensity has a similar efect.\nGAUSSIAN ERROR Deviation of a magnetic compass due to transient magnetism which remains in a vessel's structure for short periods afer the inducing force has been removed. Tis error usually appears afer the vessel has been on the same heading for a considerable time.\nGENERAL CHARTS Nautical charts which are published at scales from 1:150,001 to 1:600,000 and are intended for coastal navigation when a course is well ofshore but can be fxed by landmarks, lights, buoys, and characteristic soundings.\n228\n\n\fGENERALIZATION Te process of reducing the complexity of a presentation of map information to make it appropriate for a particular scale of product.

Geodetic observations document and explain the external gravitational feld of the earth and, to a limited degree, its internal structure.\nGEODETIC CONTROL A system of horizontal and/or vertical control stations that have been established and adjusted by geodetic methods and in which the shape and size of the Earth (geoid) have been considered in position computations.\nGEODETIC COORDINATES Te quantities of latitude, longitude, and height (ellipsoid), which defne the position of a point on the surface of the earth with respect to the reference spheroid. Also imprecisely called geographic coordinates.\nGEODETIC DATUM Te adopted position in latitude and longitude of a single point to which the charted features of a vast region are referred. It consists of fve quantities; the latitude and longitude of the point; the azimuth of a line from this point to another point to which it is tied by the triangulation; and two constants necessary to defne the terrestrial spheroid.\nELLIPSOID HEIGHT Te distance from a point to the reference ellipsoid along a line normal to the ellipsoid. Te diference between a point's ellipsoid height and its orthometric height equals the geoidal height.\nGEODETIC POSITION A position of a point on the surface of the earth expressed in terms of geodetic latitude and geodetic longitude. A geodetic position implies an adopted geodetic datum.\nGEODETIC SURVEY A survey in which the fgure and size of the Earth is considered. It is applicable for large areas and long lines and is used for the precise location of basic points suitable for controlling other surveys.\nGEOGRAPHIC CELL (GC) Te current National Geodetic Survey's Coastal Mapping Program's series identifer for shoreline data contained within the Digital Cartographic Feature File (DCFF). Geographic Cells replaced the DM series of DCFFs which superseded the registry numbers (e.g. T and TP) used to identify topographic survey manuscripts. Te GC series identifer consists of two alpha and fve numeric characters. Te alpha characters are \"GC\" for Geographic Cells while the fve numeric characters are a continuation of the DM series numbers (GC10405 being the frst GC).\nGEOGRAPHIC COORDINATES Te world-wide system of latitude and longitude used to defne the location of any point on the earth's surface.\n229\n\n\fGEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEM (GIS) A system of spatially referenced information, including computer programs that acquire, store, manipulate, analyze, and display spatial data.\nGEOGRAPHIC NUMBER Te number assigned to an aid to navigation for identifcation purposes in accordance with the lateral system of numbering.\nGEOGRAPHIC POSITION Te position of a point on the surface of the Earth expressed in terms of latitude and longitude, either geodetic or astronomic.

Te actual geoid is an equipotential surface to which, at every point, the plumb line (direction in which gravity acts) is perpendicular. Geoids currently in use are GEOID84 and GEOID90.\nGLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM (GPS) A constellation of 24 satellites operated by the U.S. Department of Defense which orbit the earth at a very high altitude. GPS satellites transmit signals that allow one to determine, with great accuracy, the locations of GPS receivers. Te receivers can be fxed on the Earth, in moving vehicles, aircraf, or in low-Earth orbiting satellites.

GPS can provide highly accurate position and velocity information in three dimensions and precise time and time interval on a global basis continuously.\nGRAPHIC SCALE A line or bar on a map or chart subdivided to represent distances on the earth in various units, to wit: nautical miles, statute miles, yards, feet, kilometers, etc. Also called bar scale or linear scale.\nGRASSY SHOAL Marsh in the early stages of development ofen found contiguous to a well-defned marsh or outside the high-water line.\nGRATICULE Te network of lines representing meridians and parallels on a map, chart, plotting sheet, etc.\nGRAVEL 1. Loose, rounded fragments of rock, larger than sand, but smaller than cobbles. 2. Small stones and pebbles, or a mixture of these with sand.\nGRAZING ANGLE Te angle at which a sonar pulse strikes, and propagates across, the seafoor. Te grazing angle of the sonar pulse has an efect on the reverberation or backscatter of the ensonifed seabed. Grazing angle algorithms in side scan sonar systems attempt to compensate for these changes and produce a uniform image in the sonar data.\nGREENWICH MEAN TIME (GMT) Mean solar time at the meridian of Greenwich, England. It has been used as a basis for standard time throughout the world. Also called Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).\n230\n\n\fGREENWICH MERIDIAN Te meridian of the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, England. Adopted in 1884 by a conference of nations as the initial or zero of longitudes for all nations.\nGRID A series of lines, usually straight and parallel, or two sets of mutually perpendicular lines, dividing a map, chart, or other representation of the earth's surface into squares or rectangles to permit the location of any point by a system of rectangular coordinates or to serve as a directional reference for navigation. A grid is not necessarily a graticule, and the terms should not be used interchangeably.\nGRIDDING A process used to thin dense hydrographic data by determining a depth at a \"grid node\" (intersection point of perpendicular grid lines) by considering points in proximity to that grid node \u00ad usually a radial distance.\nGROIN A low artifcial wall-like structure of durable material extending from the land to seaward for a particular purpose, such as to protect the coast or to force a current to scour a channel. Groins may be classifed as permeable or impermeable: impermeable groins have solid or nearly solid structure, permeable groins have openings through them of sufcient size to permit passage of appreciable quantities of littoral drif.\nGROSS ERROR Te result of carelessness or a mistake; may be detected through the repeating of the measurement. Also called blunder.\nGROUNDING Te touching of the seafoor by a vessel or by the wire sweep during a wire-drag survey.\nGROUND SURVEY A survey made by ground methods, as distinguished from an aerial survey. A ground survey may or may not include the use of photographs.\nGROUP REPETITION INTERVAL (GRI) Of a particular LORAN-C chain, the specifed time interval for all stations of the chain to transmit their pulse groups. For each chain a minimum group repetition interval (GRI) is selected of sufcient duration to provide time for each station to transmit its pulse group and additional time between each pulse group so that signals from two or more stations cannot overlap in time anywhere within the coverage area. Te GRI is normally stated in terms of tens of microseconds, i.e., the GRI having a duration of 79,900 microseconds is stated as 7990. In providing means for identifying a chain within a system all stations of which transmit on the same frequency (100 kHz), the GRI is the chain signature.\nGULF A tract of water within an indentation or curve of the coastline, in size between a bay and a sea \u00ad the Gulf of California, for example.\nGULF COAST LOW WATER DATUM (GCLWD) A tidal datum used as chart datum for the coastal waters of the Gulf coast of the United States from November 14, 1977to November 27, 1980.

A basic survey is one that is so complete and thorough it does not need to be supplemented by other surveys.\nHACHURES Short lines or wedge shaped marks on topographic maps or nautical charts to indicate the slope of the ground or the submarine bottom. Tey usually follow the direction of the slope. Hachures may be used to identify a steep coast, but unlike contours they do not show degree of slope or actual elevation of ground above chart datum. Tey may also be used to accentuate a spot elevation on very small-scale charts without contours.\nHAND LEAD A light sounding lead (7 to 14 pounds), usually having a line of not more than 25 fm.\nHARBOR A place where ships may fnd shelter. A harbor may be natural or artifcially constructed. In either case its waters are inland. Te limits of its inland waters are determined, at least in part, by their use as a harbor rather than the mere application of delimitation principles to geography, as is the case with bays and rivers.\nHARBOR CHARTS Nautical charts published at scales of 1:50,000 and larger, and intended for navigating in harbors and smaller waterways and for anchorage.\nHARBOR LINE Lines prescribed by the Corps of Engineers (USACE), which limit the length of piers and other structures projecting into navigable channels; the construction of structures channelward of this line is not permitted unless the harbor lines are modifed. Navigation improvements and surveys by the (USACE) do not extend inside (shoreward of) the harbor lines. Harbor lines are of two types, pierhead lines and bulkhead lines. Bulkhead lines are prescribed where the waterfront construction is of a solid nature, such as marginal wharves, backflled seawalls and bulkhead wharves; the water areas inside bulkhead lines normally may be flled in by private concerns upon proper application to the USACE. Pierhead lines are associated with open-type construction, such as open pile piers, and no such structure may extend channelward of these lines. For waterfronts where both types of construction occur, both\n232\n\n\flines will be prescribed. Harbor lines are usually straight line-segments crossing the outermost pierheads and/or bulkhead facilities, and are marked with accurately located, permanent monuments so that local surveyors may easily locate them.\nHARBOR OF REFUGE A harbor provided as a temporary refuge on a stormy coast for the convenience of passing shipping. It may or may not be part of a shipping port. Also called port of refuge. HDAPS Stands for Hydrographic Data Acquisition and Processing System.

In probability terminology, HDOP is an additional variable that allows one to replace the overall accuracy estimates with conditional accuracy for the given HDOP value.\nHEAD A steep cape or peninsula.\nHEADING Te horizontal direction in which a ship actually points or heads at any instant, expressed in angular units from a reference direction, usually from 000\u00b0 at the reference direction clockwise through 360\u00b0. Heading is ofen designated as true, magnetic, compass, or grid, as the reference direction is true, magnetic, compass, or grid north, respectively. Heading should not be confused with course, which is the intended direction of movement through the water. At a specifc instant the heading may or may not coincide with the course, depending upon such factors as steering errors, actions of the seas upon the ship, etc. Te heading of a ship is also called Ship's Head.\nHEADLAND 1. In common usage, a land mass having a considerable elevation. In the context of the Law of the Sea, elevation is not an important attribute and a headland may be the apex of a salient of the coast, the point of maximum extension of a portion of the land into the water, or a point on the shore at which there is an appreciable change in direction of the general trend of the coast. 2. A geographic feature that serves to give an inland water body its landlocked nature. A headland may be natural or man-made. It must be above mean low water but not by any signifcant extent. It will usually provide an appreciable change in the direction of the coast.\nHEAVE Te oscillatory rise and fall of a ship due to the entire hull being lifed by the force of the sea. Te disjointed, jagged images on a sonar record produced by heave. Heave is a major cause of data distortion. Heave compensators are used on vessels to remove the efect of this motion from the recorded seabed profle. Also applies to the rhythmic up and down movement of a towfsh in moderate to heavy seas. Under some conditions, longer tow cables will dampen the efect of heave afecting towfsh but can also result in a harmonic efect, increasing the heave.\nHIGH SEAS Te open sea beyond the Exclusive Economic Zone, the territorial sea or the archipelagic waters of an archipelagic country.\nHIGH WATER Te maximum height reached by a rising tide. Te high water is caused by the periodic tidal forces and the efects of meteorological, hydrologic, and/or oceanographic conditions. For tidal datum computational purposes, the maximum height is not considered a high water unless it contains a tidal high water.\n233\n\n\fHIGH WATER LINE 1. Te intersection of the land with the water surface at an elevation of high water. 2. A generalized term associated with the tidal plane of high water, but not with a specifc phase of high water, such as higher high water or lower high water.\nHIGH WATER MARK A line or mark lef upon tide fats, beach, or alongshore objects indicating the elevation of the intrusion of high water. Te mark may be a line of oil or scum on alongshore objects, or a more or less continuous deposit of fne shell or debris on the foreshore or berm. Tis mark is physical evidence of the general height reached by wave runup at recent high waters. It should not be confused with the mean high water line or mean higher high water line.\nHIPS VESSEL FILE (HVF) A fle generated in CARIS sofware used to set the parameters for sensors and other equipment for data processing. Previously referred to as a Vessel Confguration File (VCF).\nHISTORY SHEET See Chart History.\nHOLDING GROUND An expression usually used with a modifying adjective to indicate the quality of the holding power of the material constituting the bottom of an anchorage; e.g., of good (or poor) holding power.\nHOLIDAY An unintentionally unsurveyed area within a given hydrographic survey project, where the spacing between soundings, sounding lines, or surveys exceeds the maximum allowable limits.\nHOOK Something resembling a hook in shape, particularly (a) a spit or narrow cape of sand or gravel which turns landward at the outer end, or (b) a sharp bend or curve, as in a stream.\nHORIZONTAL BEAM WIDTH Te angle of the transmitted (and/or received) sonar beam in the along-track (transverse) dimension. Narrow horizontal beamwidths increase transverse resolution. Because beamwidth is related to transducer length and frequency, beamwidth decreases with increasing frequency for a given transducer length.\nHORIZONTAL CONTROL Historically, a network of stations of known geographic or grid positions referred to a common horizontal datum, which control the horizontal position of mapped features with respect to parallel and meridians, or northing and easting grid lines shown on the map. Horizontal control includes basic (marked) and supplementary (unmarked) stations.\nHORIZONTAL CONTROL STATION A station whose position has been accurately determined in x and y grid coordinates, or latitude and longitude. Also called horizontal control point.\nHORIZONTAL DATUM 1. At its most basic level of defnition, the horizontal datum is a collection of specifc points on the Earth that have been identifed according to their precise northerly or southerly location (latitude), and their easterly or westerly location (longitude).\n234\n\n\f2. A reference system for specifying positions on the Earth's surface. Each datum is associated with a particular reference spheroid that can be diferent in size, orientation, and relative position from the spheroids associated with other horizontal datums. Positions referred to diferent datums can difer by several hundred meters.\nHPS Stands for Hydrographic Processing System. Outdated proprietary NOAA hydrographic data processing sofware.\nHULK Te hull or portion of the hull of a derelict vessel, usually without superstructure or other appurtenance. A major portion of the hulk is usually visible at some stage of tide.\nHYDRO HOT LIST A list, maintained by CO-OPS, of water level stations which are currently providing data for NOAA hydrographic surveys. If a station is on the Hydro Hot List, the gauge's data is carefully monitored and its processing is given priority over other gauges.\nHYDRODYNAMIC DEPRESSOR A tow assembly depressor designed with vanes or a wing oriented in such a way as to increase negative lif when exposed to an increased water fow. Hydrodynamic depressors work by increasing the downward pull on the towbody end of the cable during towing. Te advantage of this kind of depressor is that they are lightweight and relatively easy to deploy. Some types can be rigged to invert and increase drag if they come in contact with the seabed, thus rapidly bringing the towfsh to altitude and out of collision danger. Tey must be rigged carefully so as to be tangle-free during and afer deployment. A disadvantage to the hydrodynamic depressor is that an increase in towspeed will not raise the towfsh to avoid an obstruction. It may, instead, bring it deeper. Another disadvantage to this type of depressor is that it typically requires signifcant towspeeds to develop efectiveness.\nHYDROGRAPHER One who studies and practices the science of hydrography.

Te HDCS data format uses the Project/Vessel/ Day/Line (PVDL) hierarchical structure to store the information.\nHYDROGRAPHIC MANUALS Te form of publication used by NOAA since 1928 for providing instructions for hydrographic work. Four suchmanuals have been issued to date \u00ad in 1928, 1942, 1960, and 1976.\nHYDROGRAPHIC SURVEY A survey having for its principal purpose the acquisition of data relating to a body of water for the purpose of promoting safe navigation. A hydrographic survey may consist of or require one or several of the following classes of data: depth of water; confguration and nature of the bottom; velocity of currents; heights and times of tides and water levels; location of aids and dangers to navigation; confguration of marginal land areas; and determination of magnetic declination and anomalies for navigating by magnetic compass. Information on geographic names and harbor facilities may also be documented.\nHYDROGRAPHIC SURVEY EXAMINATION Consequent to a formal policy transferring responsibility for hydrographic survey quality and fnal approval to the then Ofce of Marine Operations, the quality control of all hydrographic survey products was discontinued in October, 1982. Instead, procedures and policies were established to conduct quality control examinations on a\n235\n\n\fstatistically representative sample consisting of not more than 10% of products. Tis examination was identifed as a Hydrographic Survey Examination and was approximately equivalent to the preparation of a Quality Control Report. However, it difered from the quality control examination in that the efort was directed toward evaluating compliance with, and the adequacy of, standards, rather than a careful examination of the data and their quality. Each survey selected was carefully examined by a cartographer for adequacy with respect to data acquisition and conformance with applicable standards and project instructions. In addition, the overall condition of the records and the descriptive report were reviewed. Te digital data representing the survey was plotted and subjected to a cursory examination to determine the degree of compliance with digital data standards. Te examination was limited to only that necessary to evaluate the acquisition and processing procedures.\nHYDROGRAPHIC SURVEY GUIDELINES A discontinued series of guidelines initiated in 1979 to emphasize, interpret, and supplement material contained in the NOAA Hydrographic Manual, Fourth Edition, and various other publications and memorandums. Te Guidelines were intended primarily for communication of processing techniques between the Hydrographic Surveys Division and the Marine Centers.\nHYDROGRAPHIC SURVEY SHEET An inclusive term used to designate boat sheets, feld sheets, and smooth sheets.\nHYDROGRAPHY Te branch of applied science which deals with the measurement and description of the physical features of the navigable portion of the Earth's surface and adjoining coastal areas, with special reference to their use for the purpose of navigation.\nHYDROPHONE A sonar receiver functioning by transforming underwater sound signals (pressure waves) into electrical signals. Ofen a hydrophone is a passive device doing no transmitting on its own.\nHYPERBOLIC POSITIONING SYSTEM A positioning system in which the observer measures the diference in time of reception of signals from two stations whose coordinates are known. Te diference in time is converted to a diference in distance. Te locus of all points lying at a fxed diference in distance from two points are the two branches of a hyperbola. Tere is usually a third station operating in conjunction with one of the two to provide the observer with another diference in distance and another pair of hyperbola branches. Te observer is at one of the intersections of the branches. LORAN is the oldest known positioning system using this technique.\n7.9 I\nIDENTIFICATION LETTERS AND NUMBERS Letters and numbers (in color) once used to identify sounding lines on a hydrographic survey sheet and which correspond to those used in the sounding records.\nIHB See International Hydrographic Bureau.\nIHO See International Hydrographic Organization.\n236\n\n\fIKONOS Te Ikonos-2 satellite was launched in September, 1999, and has been delivering commercial data since early 2000. Ikonos is the frst of the next generation of high spatial resolution satellites. Ikonos data records 4 channels of multispectral data at 4 m resolution, and 1 panchromatic channel with 1 m resolution. Tis means that Ikonos was the frst private-sector satellite to deliver near-photographic high-resolution satellite imagery of objects or specifed locations anywhere in the world, e.g., shorelines. Ikonos-2 is equipped with a Kodak digital camera. Tis payload will enable the satellite to collect 1-m resolution panchromatic (gray-scale) resolution and 4-m resolution, 4-band multi-spectral (red, green, blue, near infrared) imagery of the Earth. Te camera is comprised of a Kodak-designed and -manufactured focal plane array and a lightweight telescope using a state-of-the-art mirror fabricated with Kodak's advanced ion-fguring technology. To speed the downloading of data to Space Imaging EOSAT's ground receiving stations, the original 11-bit data will be compressed using Kodak's proprietary bandwidth compression technology.\nIMPROVED CHANNELS Dredged channels under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and maintained to provide an assigned controlling depth. Symbolized on the nautical/navigational charts by black, dashed lines to represent the side limits, with the controlling depth and date of ascertainment; sometimes accompanied by a tabulation for more detailed information.\nINERTIAL POSITIONING SYSTEM A positioning system consisting of a computer and an assemblage of three accelerometers and two or three gyroscopes. Te gyroscopes are fastened together in such a way that they defne the orientation of the accelerometers with respect to non-rotating coordinates and the accelerometers measure the components of acceleration of the positioning system along the directions defned by the gyroscopes. Te computer and associated equipment integrate the components of acceleration to give the 3 components of displacement of the positioning system.\nINFORMATION AWOIS ITEM An AWOIS item for which no search radius has been assigned. If the item is detected in the course of hydrography, develop to fullest extent.\nINLAND RULES OF THE ROAD Rules to be followed by all vessels while navigating upon certain inland waters of the U.S. See also Colregs.\nINLAND WATER LINE A series of straight lines developed by the Coast Guard to separate areas that are subject to its Inland Rules of the Road from those to which the International Rules apply.

Specifc information is contained within 33 U.S.C. Chapter 3. Also known as \"internal waters.\"\nINLET 1. A narrow strip of water running into the land or between islands. 2. An arm of the sea (or other body of water) that is long compared to its width, and that may extend a considerable distance inland.\nINNER HARBOR Te part of a harbor more remote from the sea, as contrasted with the outer harbor. Tese expressions are usually used only in a harbor that is clearly divided into two parts, as by a narrow passageway or man-made structures. Te inner harbor generally has additional protection and is ofen the principal berthing area.\n237\n\n\fINS See Integrated Navigation System.\nINSET In cartography: (a) a small area outside the neat lines of a map or chart included within the neat lines or borders to avoid publishing a separate graphic of the small area alone; (b) a representation of a small area on a larger scale (e.g., town-plan inset), or of a large area at a smaller scale (e.g., orientation inset); (c) any information, not normally appearing within the geographic limits of a map, which has been enclosed by border lines and included within the map neat lines. Insets are always placed in areas where important features will not be covered. See Subplan.\nINSHORE 1. In beach terminology, the zone of varying width extending from the low water line through the breaker zone. 2. In NOAA operational hydrography terminology, the zone extending shoreward from depths of 8 m.\nINTEGRATED NAVIGATION SYSTEM Most commonly, a computer-based navigation system deployed on large vessels. INS systems have one or more displays and take input from a navigational device such as a GPS receiver and display the ship's track, course, and heading on a screen. Modern units allow the user to log targets, flter errant position fxes, log the ship's position history, display user-defned lines the ship is to follow, and display shorelines.\nINTERFERENCE Te display of erroneous signals from acoustic or electrical sources that confict with the display of the primary sonar data. Interference can be internal to the sonar system, but is most commonly from other sources. Causes of external interference include generator noise, electromagnetic radiation from other electronics, ship's engines and propellers, fow noise, and noise from biological sources. See Noise.\nINTERFEROMETRIC SONAR A system based on the process by which two or more sonar waves of the same frequency combine to reinforce or cancel each other, the amplitude of the resulting wave being equal to the sum of the amplitudes of each of the combining waves. Because the angle of interference can be determined, these sonar systems provide bathymetric information over a wide swath.\nINTERNATIONAL CHART One of a coordinated series of small-scale charts for planning and long range navigation. Te charts are prepared and published by diferent Member States of the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) using the same specifcations.\nINTERNATIONAL GREAT LAKES DATUM 1985 (IGLD) A vertical control datum having its zero horizontal plane at mean sea level at Rimouski, Quebec, as determined from measurements at Rimouski/Pointe-au-Pere over the period 1982-1988. It is used primarily for the defnition of the chart datum, Low Water Datum, in each of the Great Lakes, their connecting waterways, and the St. Lawrence River, and for hydraulic studies of the same. IGLD (1985) was implemented, efective January 1992, replacing the old International Great Lakes Datum (1955).\nINTERNATIONAL HYDROGRAPHIC BUREAU (IHB) An organization founded in 1921 for the purpose of establishing a close and permanent association among hydrographic ofces of its 19 Member States. Te Bureau was provided with headquarters in the Principality of Monaco by H.S.H. Prince Albert I of Monaco, a noted marine scientist. In 1970, an intergovernmental Convention entered into force which changed the organization's name and legal status, creating the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO), with its headquarters (the IHB) permanently established in Monaco.\n238\n\n\fINTERNATIONAL HYDROGRAPHIC ORGANIZATION (IHO) An intergovernmental consultative and technical organization that traces its origin to 1921 and was established to support safety in marine navigation and the protection of the marine environment. Te main objectives of the IHO is to bring about the coordination of the activities of national hydrographic ofces, the greatest possible uniformity in nautical charts and documents, the adoption of reliable and efcient methods of carrying out and exploiting hydrographic surveys, the development of the sciences in the feld of hydrography and the techniques employed in descriptive oceanography.\nINTERNATIONAL NAUTICAL MILE In 1929, the International Hydrographic Conference in Monaco defned the international nautical mile as exactly 1,852 m, about 6,076.11549 f.\nINTRACOASTAL WATERWAY An approximately 3,000 mile-long, partly natural, partly artifcial, waterway, providing sheltered passage for commercial and leisure boats along the U.S. Atlantic coast from Boston, MA to Key West, in southern FL, and along the Gulf of Mexico coast from Apalachee Bay, in NW FL, to Brownsville, TX, on the Rio Grande. Te tollfree waterway, authorized by Congress in 1919, is maintained by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers at a minimum depth of 12 f (4 m) for most of its length; some parts have 7-f (2.1-m) and 9-f (2.7-m) minimum depths.

Te Julian day begins at noon, 12 hours later than the corresponding civil day. For example, the day beginning at noon January 1, 1968 was Julian day 2,439,857. Tis term is ofen incorrectly used when referring to the sequential 3-digit day number of the year. Te sequential 3-digit day number of the year should be referred to as the \"day of year\" or \"day number\" rather than as the \"Julian Day.\"\nJUNCTION A place of meeting or joining. In hydrographic surveying, the joining of two or more adjacent/adjoining survey sheets.\n239\n\n\fJUNCTION BUOY A buoy which, when viewed from a vessel approaching from the open sea or in the same direction as the main stream of food current, or in the direction established by appropriate authority, indicates the place at which two channels meet. Also referred to as a Bifurcation Buoy.\n7.11 K\nKAPP A unique number assigned to each chart panel, inset, or extension of all agency nautical charts. See Chapp.\nKELP An order of usually large blade-shaped or vine-like brown algae that grows on rocky bottoms and is therefore associated with possible dangers to navigation.\nKEY See Cay.\nKINEMATIC SURVEYING Kinematic surveying is a method of surveying with GPS that initially solves wavelength ambiguities and retains the resulting measurements by maintaining a lock on a specifc number of satellites throughout an entire surveying period. Observations are made while a receiver is in motion. In surveying applications, kinematic refers to uninterrupted carrier-phase measurements following successful solution of the integer ambiguities. Tis can be accomplished in a continuous mode where the receiver remains in motion for precise positioning of a vehicle, or in an intermittent mode where data is recorded only afer a receiver is brought to a stationary point, and the observations while in motion are tracked as a way to maintain the integer ambiguities.\nKITING A rhythmic, lateral movement experienced by tow bodies on long cables and in deep water; most ofen induced by poor hydrodynamics of a depressor. Te proper application of depressors is important to maintain reliable fsh stability. One depressor shape and form may work well at only certain speeds, while creating instabilities at others. Kiting is one of a variety of instabilities that can be recognized in sonar data.\nKNOT A unit of speed defned (1978) as 1 international nautical mile per hour. It was previously defned as 1 nautical mile per hour, but this led to confusion because the American and British nautical miles difer by 1.184 m. Te knot is equal to 1.852 km/hr.\n7.12 L\nLAGOON A shallow body of water which usually has a shallow restricted inlet from the sea.\nLAKE Any standing body of inland water, generally of considerable size. Tere are exceptions, such as the lakes in Louisiana which are open to or connect with the Gulf of Mexico.

Tese 40-f diameter buoys may show secondary lights from heights of about 36 f above the water. In addition to the light, such buoys may mount a radiobeacon and provide sound signals. A station buoy may be moored nearby.\nLARGE SCALE SURVEY (CHART) A scale involving a relatively small reduction in size. A large scale chart is one covering a small area. Te opposite is small scale. In agency usage, a scale of 1:80,000 would be the upper limit of classifcation.\nLATERAL OFFSET Te position of the towfsh of to the side of the surface vessel's track. Tis occurs when the surface vessel track is not aligned with a surface or subsea current. It can also be caused by poor hydrodynamics. Te efect of the current will pull the towfsh away from the vessel trackline. In extreme cases, the towfsh can also crab into such a current and result in a loss of data.\nLATERAL SYSTEM A system of aids to navigation in which buoys, daybeacons, and minor lights are assigned colors and shapes in accordance with their respective location in relation to safe water.\nLATTICE A pattern formed by two or more families of intersecting lines, such as the pattern formed by two or more families of hyperbolas representing curves of equal time diference associated with a hyperbolic radio navigation system. Sometimes the term \"pattern\" is used to indicate curves of equal time diference, with the term \"lattice\" being used to indicate its representation on the chart.\nLATITUDE Angular distance from a Primary Great Circle or plane, usually the Equator. One of the coordinates used to describe a position, the other being longitude.\nLAW OF THE SEA CONVENTION Te United Nations' 1982 Convention that, for most purposes, supersedes the four Geneva Conventions of 1958. Te \"baseline\" provisions of the Law of the Sea Convention do not deviate signifcantly from those of the Convention on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone. Te Supreme Court's adoption of the 1958 principles for purposes of the Submerged Lands Act is not afected by the new Convention. Entered into force on November\n241\n\n\f16, 1994. Te United States has recognized most provisions of the 1982 Convention as customary international law (including the baseline provisions).\nLAYBACK Te horizontal distance between the survey vessel, or the navigation antenna, and the towfsh. In deep water towing, this distance is important for positioning features on the seabed and geo-coding sonar data for mosaics. Because most navigation instruments provide the position of their antenna mounted on the vessel and the \"x, y\" origin of the sonar image is at the towfsh, this diference in position can be signifcant. Many methods of subtracting this distance have been tested using acoustics and algorithms. Acoustic fsh positioning methods rarely work well and ofen cause more problems than they solve. Algorithms, while not calculating such parameters as lateral ofset, are very accurate in eliminating layback errors.\nLEAD A weight attached to a line. A sounding lead is used for determining depth of water. A hand lead is a light sounding lead (7 - 14 lbs), usually having a line of not more than 25 fm. A deep sea lead is a heavy sounding lead (about 30 - 100 lbs), usually having a line 100 fm or more in length. A light deep sea lead (30 - 50 lbs), used for sounding depths of 20 - 60 fm, is called a coasting lead. A type of sounding lead used without removal from the water between soundings is called a fsh lead. A drif lead is one placed on the bottom to indicate movement of a vessel. To heave the lead is to take a sounding with a lead.\nLEAD LINE A line, graduated with attached marks and fastened to a sounding lead, used for determining the depth of water when taking soundings by hand. Te lead line is usually used in depths of less than 25 fm. Also called a sounding line.\nLEAGUE A measure of distance, varying for diferent times and for diferent countries, from 2.4 - 4.6 miles. In the U.S. it is considered to be about three miles.\nLEAST DEPTH Te minimum depth of a submerged feature. Te term is only used when the quality of the sounding meets existing hydrographic accuracy standards. It is never considered to be an approximate depth.\nLEDGE A rocky formation connected with and fringing the shore, and generally uncovered at the sounding datum. Where such features exist, the seaward limit of the area that uncovers is usually symbolized on smooth sheets and serves as a substitute for the zero depth curve.\nLEEWARD Te direction toward which the prevailing wind is blowing; the direction toward which waves are traveling.\nLEFT BANK Te river bank on the lef-hand side as one proceeds downstream.\nLEGEND A description, explanation, table of symbols, and other information, printed on a map or chart to provide a better understanding and interpretation of it.

Also called diferential leveling.\nLIDAR (LIght Detection and Ranging) An airborne instrument that measures distance to an object by emitting timed pulses of light and measuring the time between emission and reception of the refected pulses. Te measured time interval is converted into distance. Topographic LIDAR measures elevations on land. Bathymetric LIDAR uses two diferent laser frequencies to measure water depths (one refects of the water surface and the other of the seafoor). Te ability of bathymetric\nLIDAR to obtain such depth information is totally dependent on water turbidity but can measure depths of 60 meters in very clear water.\nLIGHT A luminous or lighted aid to navigation.\nLIGHTHOUSE A building on some conspicuous point of the coast, a pier or jetty, an island or rock, from which a light is exhibited at night as an aid to navigation. All maritime nations have government departments responsible for the establishment and maintenance of lighthouses.\nLIGHT LIST A publication that lists and describes all marine aids to navigation maintained by or under authority of the U.S. Coast Guard.\nLIGHT LIST NUMBER Te number used to identify a navigational light in the Light List.\nLIGHT SECTOR As defned by bearings from seaward, the sector in which a navigational light is visible or in which it has a distinctive color diferent from that of adjoining sectors, or in which it is obscured.\nLINE A course or track, down the center of which a survey vessel travels during a survey. A line is delineated on either side by half the distance between the current and adjacent tracks. A common method of using sonar to perform search or survey operations is to set up a series of parallel lines. Represented as imaginary lines on the sea surface, they may be depicted on a computer screen from an Integrated Navigation System.\nLINEAR SCALE Known in the U.S. as a bar scale. A sub-divided line which shows distances at a given scale. See also Graphic Scale.\nLINE FEATURE A cartographic feature with the geometry of a line, i.e., defned by a sequence of connected points.

One of the coordinates used to describe a position, the other being latitude.\nLORAN A navigation system developed in the 1950s based on the time displacement between signals from two or more fxed shore based antennas. Two types of LORAN (an acronym for LOng RAnge Navigation) were developed. A low resolution LORAN-A was frst. Cumbersome and difcult to use, LORAN-A required the user to tune a receiver and align signal peaks on a scope. A more efcient system, LORAN-C, was developed for use in the 1960s and provided the user with a readout of numbers representing time diferences in microseconds. American charts were produced with these \"TD\" lines overprinted on them. Although LORAN-C was very repeatable (ofen to within 20 m), the system was not accurately tied to any datum. Further, since the radio transmissions propagated over land, conversion to latitude and longitude was only approximate, at best. For several decades since the late 1950s, LORAN was the major worldwide land-based navigation system. Ofshore beyond the 600-mile range of these systems, dead reckoning with occasional fxes from transit satellites was a large part of ocean navigation. Te Global Positioning System is expected to completely replace the need for LORAN transmitting stations worldwide.\nLOW ORDER STATIONS A category of control established by ground survey methods that do not meet established Tird-Order criteria. Included are stations positioned through the use of a sextant or planetable, and any station positioned from, or sighting on, a moving object such that repeat measurements cannot be made.\n244\n\n\fLOWER LOW WATER (LLW) Te lowest of the low waters (or single low water) of any specifed tidal day due to the declinational efects of the Moon and Sun.\nLOW-TIDE ELEVATION A naturally formed area of land surrounded by and above water at low tide but submerged at high tide.

Te geographic parallels are represented by a second system of straight lines perpendicular to the family of lines representing the meridians, and therefore parallel with the Equator. Conformality is achieved by mathematical analysis, the spacing of the parallels being increased with the increasing distance from the Equator to conform with the expanding scale along the parallels resulting from the meridians being represented by parallel lines. Since Rhumb Lines appear as straight lines and directions can be measured directly, this projection is widely used in navigation.\nMERIDIAN LINE A north-south line from which longitudes or azimuths are reckoned.\nMERIDIANS A north-south reference line, particularly a great circle through the geographical poles of the earth. Meridians are measured in degrees east or west of the prime meridian and pass through longitude 0\u00b0. See Longitude.\nMERIDIONAL PARTS Te length of the arc, expressed in units of 1 min of longitude at the equator, of a meridian between the Equator and any parallel of latitude on the graticule of the Mercator map projection. See Tables for a Polyconic Projection of Maps.\nMETES AND BOUNDS Te boundary lines or limits of a tract of land. One of the oldest methods of describing land and was used to transfer lands in the Tirteen Original Colonies. Defned variously in law dictionaries as: the boundary lines of land, with their terminal points and angles; the boundary lines and corners of a piece of land; and the boundary lines of lands with their terminating points of angles.\nMILE A unit of distance. Te nautical mile, or sea mile, is used primarily in navigation. Nearly all maritime nations have adopted the International Nautical Mile of 1,852 m proposed in 1929 by the International Hydrographic Bureau. Te International Nautical Mile is equivalent to 6076.11549 f, approximately. Te geographical mile is the length of 1 minute of arc of the equator, considered to be 6,087.08 f. Te statute mile or land mile (5,280 f in the U.S.) is commonly used for navigation on rivers and lakes, notably the Great Lakes of North America.\nMILEAGE NUMBER Assigned to aids and gives the distance in sailing miles along the river from a reference point to the aid. Principally used in the Mississippi River System.\nMINIMUM OBSERVED DEPTH Te shallowest depth over a submerged feature obtained during the course of a non-specifc investigation. It may not be the Least Depth but could be reclassifed as such following a careful review of the data to determine if it meets or exceeds current specifcations for a basic hydrographic survey.\n248\n\n\fMICRO WAVE POSITIONING SYSTEM A compact, light, and mobile distance measuring system that operates on the basic principle of pulse radar. A transmitter aboard the survey vessel interrogates transponders at known locations. Elapsed time between transmitted interrogations and the reply from each transponder is used as the basis for determining range to each transponder. Tis range information, together with the known location of each transponder, can be trilaterated to provide the position of the survey vessel. A widely used type of survey positioning system in the 1970's through early 1990's which was made obsolete by GPS.\nMINOR AID TO NAVIGATION An unmanned, unmonitored light on a fxed structure showing usually low to moderate intensity; generally ftted with light characteristics and day boards in accordance with its lateral signifcance in the waterway.\nMINUS SOUNDINGS Soundings that reduce to height above the sounding datum (plane of reference) when corrected for water level. Minus soundings are shown on the smooth sheet preceded by a minus sign unless they are used to denote the least depth on a wreck or obstruction. In that case, the sounding is portrayed as an underlined value in parentheses. A minus sounding has a value above chart datum. For example, chart datum of MLLW would be the 0 contour; a value of -1 would be 1 f above MLLW chart datum water line.\nMISCELLANEOUS SOURCES Source information provided by other organizations. Such sources would include the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Coast Guard, National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (formerly known as the National Imagery and Mapping Agency or NIMA), U.S. Geological Survey, Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. National Park Service, and state, local, and foreign government sources.\nMIXED TIDES Tides characterized by a conspicuous diurnal inequality in the higher high and lower high waters and/or the higher low and lower low waters. Quantitatively, a tide is mixed if the ratio of diurnal tidal constituents K1+O1 to the semidiurnal constituents M2+S2 is between 0.25 and 3.0.\nMODIFIED ROUTE CHARTS NOS charts that are versions of Intracoastal Waterway charts that were originally issued in a conventional chart format. Tey are identical in construction and format to area charts, and are used for some areas not adaptable to route chart style for long, narrow waterways. See Route Charts.\nMOLE A form of breakwater alongside which vessels may lie on the sheltered side only; in some cases it may lie entirely within an artifcial harbor, permitting vessels to lie along both sides.\nMONUMENT In surveying, a structure used or erected to mark the position of a station; permanence is implied.\nMOORING 1. A place where a vessel may be secured. 2. Te process of securing a vessel, other than anchoring with a single anchor.\nMOORING BUOY A buoy secured to the sea foor by permanent moorings and provided with means for mooring a vessel by use of its anchor chain or mooring lines.\n249\n\n\fMORAINE An accumulation of earth, stones, etc., deposited by a glacier, usually in the form of a mount, ridge, or other prominence on the terrain. In charting, these features ofen exist at the entrance to or within ford-like waterways and, frequently, contain hazardous shoal depths or rocky obstructions.\nMOSAIC An assembly of side scan sonar records matched in such a way as to show a continuous, two-dimensional representation of an area of seabed.\nMOTION REFERENCE UNIT (MRU) Measures the motion of the vessel or platform, usually Heave, Pitch, and Roll. Yaw is also measured by some MRUs.\nMUD FLAT A muddy, low-lying strip of ground by the shore, or an island, usually submerged more or less completely by the rise of the tide.\nMULTIPATH As related to echo sounding, sonar signals arriving at a target, or returning to a transducer from a single source but along diferent paths. Multipath returns in imaging sonars typically occur in shallow water or around complex structures, such as petroleum platforms or near piers and pilings. A classic multipath environment for side scan sonar is in shallow water with a fat sea surface. Acoustic echoes will return to the transducer along 3 diferent paths: 1. transducer - target \u00ad transducer; 2. transducer - target - sea surface - transducer; and 3. transducer - sea surface - target - sea surface - transducer. If these 3 return paths take 3 diferent times, the result will be 3 images of the same target in the data. As related to navigation systems (e.g., GPS) multipath is the corruption of the direct GPS signal by refection from the local surroundings which adversely afects measurements in a GPS receiver.\n7.14 N\nNALL See Navigable Area Limit Line\nNARROWS A navigable narrow part of a bay, strait, river, etc.\nNATIONAL GEODETIC VERTICAL DATUM of 1929 [NGVD (1929)] Previously called the Sea Level Datum of 1929, it was a vertical control datum established for vertical control in the United States by the general adjustment of 1929. Te datum was derived for surveys from a general adjustment of the frst-order leveling nets of both the U.S. and Canada. In the adjustment, which was made in 1929, mean sea level was held fxed as observed at 21 tide stations in the U.S. and 5 in Canada. Te datum (was) not mean sea level, the geoid, or any other equipotential surface. Terefore it was renamed, in 1973, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum on 1929. Tis vertical datum was in use until the adoption, in 1991, of the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 which held fxed the height of the primary tidal bench mark, referenced to the new International Great Lakes Datum of 1985 local mean sea level height value, at Father Point/Rimouski, Quebec, Canada.\nNATIONAL TIDAL DATUM EPOCH (NTDE) Te specifc 19-year period adopted by the National Ocean Service as the ofcial time segment over which tide observations are taken and reduced to obtain mean values (e.g. mean lower low ware, etc.) for tidal datums. It is the policy of NOS to consider a revised NTDE every 20-25 years in order to take into account relative sea level changes caused by global sea level change and the efects of long term local land movement due to subsidence or\n250\n\n\fglacial rebound. Te present NTDE is 1983-2001. Previous tidal epochs were determined for periods 1924-42, 1941-59, and 1960-78.\nNATURAL HARBOR A harbor possessing natural shelter in a large degree. Natural harbors require only the provision of such facilities as quays or piers and sometimes deepening by artifcial means to make them serviceable as shipping ports.\nNATURAL SHORELINE Te line of contact between the surface of a body of water and natural land, including islands. It does not include the water line along foating or man-made features, or along rocks smaller than those considered to be islands.\nNAUTICAL Of or pertaining to ships, navigation (chiefy marine), or seamen. In contrast, navigational refers to navigation only; marine refers to the sea; maritime indicates relationship or proximity to the sea; and naval refers to the navy.\nNAUTICAL CHART A representation of a portion of the navigable waters of the earth and adjacent coastal areas on a specifed map projection, and designed specifcally to meet requirements of marine navigation. Included on most nautical charts are: depths of water, characteristics of the bottom, elevations of selected topographic features, general confguration and characteristics of the coast, the shoreline (usually the mean high water line), dangers, obstruction, aids to navigation, limited tidal data, and information about magnetic variation in the charted area.\nNAUTICAL MILE A unit of distance used in marine navigation, which may be taken as equal to the length of a minute of arc along the equator or a minute of latitude on the map which is being measured. Nearly all maritime nations have adopted the International Nautical Mile of 1,852 m proposed in 1929 by the International Hydrographic Bureau. See Mile.\nNAVIGABLE Afording passage to a craf; capable of being navigated.\nNAVIGABLE AREA LIMIT LINE (NALL) An alongshore survey line that is also known as a shoreline bufer. Te shoreline bufer or NALL should be run at or near low water prior to acquiring mainscheme hydrography in the near shore area. Te shoreline bufer is a way of providing the hydrographer a \"frst look\" at the near shore detail, which may identify gross discrepancies in the source or charted shoreline, and reveal signifcant ofshore features that may pose a risk to a survey launch at higher water.\nNAVIGABLE AREA SURVEYS (NAS) Basic hydrographic surveys with restricted area coverage. By restricting the area of coverage while retaining the \"basic\" hydrography concept within surveyed waters, a more rapid progression of feld work is realized. Te coverage is typically reduced by omitting requirements for: (1) development of the 0-foot depth curve and (2) foul, nearshore areas not considered navigable. Navigable Area Surveys may also be restricted to the main navigable channel or corridor.\nNAVIGABLE WATERS Waters usable, with or without improvements, as routes for commerce in the customary means of travel on water.\nNAVIGABLE WATERS OF A STATE Navigable waterways that lie wholly within the limits of a state and have no navigable connection with any navigable\n251\n\n\fwaters outside the boundaries of that state. Such intrastate waters are subject to regulation and control by state laws and do not fall within the jurisdiction of Congress nor of the laws enacted by it for the preservation and protection of the navigable waters of the United States.\nNAVIGABLE WATERS OF THE UNITED STATES Waters which form, in their ordinary condition by themselves, or by uniting with other waters, a continuous highway over which commerce is or may be carried on with other states or foreign countries in the customary modes in which such commerce is conducted by water. Tis applies also to an artifcial canal, even though the canal is wholly within the body of a state and subject to its ownership and control.\nNAVIGATION RESPONSE TEAMS Navigation Response Teams are Ofce of Coast Survey feld units that perform surveys for emergency responses, such as following groundings or hurricanes, and for updating NOS nautical charts. An NRT unit typically consists of a small survey boat capable of being transported by trailer, an ofce trailer, and a crew of three hydrographers.\nNAVIGATIONAL AID An instrument, device, chart, method, etc., intended to assist in the navigation of a craf. Tis expression should not be confused with the term \"Aids to Navigation\", which refers only to devices external to a craf.\nNEAT LINE A line, usually a grid or a graticule, bounding the detail of a map. Also referred to as inner neat line, to diferentiate it from a border drawn outside of a neat line.\nNECK Te narrow strip of land with water on each side and connecting two larger bodies of land; an isthmus.\nNEW CHART A chart usually constructed to satisfy the needs of navigation in a particular area, e.g., because the area had no prior adequate chart coverage of the same scale, or because the limits are radically changed. Te new chart may cancel an existing chart.\nNEW EDITION A chart issue that cancels a previous issue. If the new information renders that existing chart obsolete, the new printing is designated a new edition. A new edition refects one or more changes of such importance to navigation that all previous printings are obsolete. Changes may be based on corrections from the Notice to Mariners (NTM) in addition to other sources. Te date of a new edition is the date of the latest NGA NTM from which the chart has been corrected. Te edition number and date are printed in the lower lef corner of the chart.\nNIMA (National Imagery and Mapping Agency) Former name of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), which was adopted in November 2003.\nNOISE Extraneous signals detected by a sonar that afect the system's efciency to display, and the operator's efciency to interpret, the signals of interest. Noise can originate from many diferent sources both internal and external to the sonar system. See Interference.\nNOMINAL RANGE Te maximum distance a light may be seen in clear weather (meteorological visibility of 10 Nautical Miles (NM), without regard to the curvature of the earth, the height of the eye, or the height of the light. Listed for all federal lighted aids, except range lights and directional lights.\n252\n\n\fNON-TIDAL WATERS Waters not subject to tidal infuence. Under Public Law 31, lands beneath such waters of a state which were navigable when the state entered the Union are granted to the state.\nNORTH AMERICAN DATUM (NAD) A horizontal control datum which is the same as United States Standard Datum. Te name was changed to North American Datum early in 1913 when Canada and Mexico adopted the United States Standard Datum for their triangulation. Tis change in name refected the continental character the datum now assumed.\nNORTH AMERICAN DATUM of 1927 (NAD27) Te name to which the North American Datum was changed in 1932 as a result of the unifed adjustment of the triangulation in the western half of the country. Te North American Datum of 1927 (NAD 27) was the horizontal control datum for the U.S. that was defned by a location and azimuth on the Clarke spheroid of 1866, with its origin at the survey station Meades Ranch, Kansas. Te geoidal height at Meades Ranch was assumed to be zero. As of 1963, all of the conterminous United States and the whole of Alaska (including the ofshore islands in the Bering Sea) were connected by one continuous triangulation and placed on NAD27.\nNORTH AMERICAN DATUM of 1983 (NAD83) Te modern horizontal control datum for the United States, Canada, Mexico, and Central America which is based on a geocentric (earth centered) origin and the Geodetic Reference System 1980. NAD 83 is based on the adjustment of 250,000 points including 600 satellite Doppler stations which constrain the system to a geocentric origin. Te computation of the NAD 83 removed signifcant local distortions from the network which had accumulated over the years, using the original observations, and makes NAD 83 much more compatible with modern survey techniques.\nNOTICE TO MARINERS (NTM) A weekly publication of the NGA, which corrects NGA and National Ocean Service (NOS) charts using information collected from many sources including the U. S. Coast Guard Local Notice to Mariners. Te publication contains only those chart corrections of interest to ocean going vessels.

Te Earth is approximately an oblate spheroid.\nOBSCURED Said of the arc of a light sector designated by its limiting bearings in which the light is not visible from seaward.\n253\n\n\fOBSOLETE CHART A chart which is not considered safe to use for navigation because it does not contain the latest important navigational information.\nOBSTRUCTION Anything that hinders or prevents movement, particularly anything that endangers or prevents passage of a vessel or aircraf. Te term is usually used to refer to an isolated danger to navigation, such as a submerged rock or pinnacle in the case of marine navigation.\nOBSTRUCTION BUOY A buoy used alone to indicate a dangerous reef or shoal. Te buoy may be passed on either hand.\nOBSTRUCTION MARK A navigation mark used alone to indicate a dangerous reef or shoal. Te mark may be passed on either hand.\nOCCULTING LIGHT A light in which the total duration of darkness in a period is shorter than the total duration of light and appearances of darkness are usually of equal duration.\nOCEANOGRAPHY Te study of the ocean, embracing and integrating all knowledge pertaining to the ocean's physical boundaries, the chemistry and physics of sea water, marine biology and submarine geology.\nOCEAN SURVEY SHEETS (OSS) Antiquated term that refers to survey sheets that cover large areas of the ocean. Limits of the OSS series were designed to conform closely to the U.S. Navy Bathymetric series.\nOFFSHORE In NOAA operational hydrographic terms, the zone extending seaward from depths of 8 m. In general terms, the comparatively fat zone of variable width which extends from the outer margin of the rather steeply sloping shoreface to the edge of the continental shelf.\nOFFSHORE WIND A wind blowing from the land toward the sea.\nOFF STATION Used to describe a foating navigational aid that is not \"on station\" or in its assigned geographic location.\nOLD HAWAIIAN DATUM Te standard horizontal datum for the main Hawaiian islands. Old Hawaiian Datum is an independent datum that was derived from the North American Datum 1927 (NAD27).\nON STATION Used to describe a foating navigational aid that is in its assigned geographic location. Opposite of Of Station.\nONSHORE WIND A wind blowing from the sea toward the land.\n254\n\n\fOOZE A fne-grained pelagic sediment containing more than 30% organic material combined with amorphous claysized material and found only in the greater ocean (abyssal) depths of the Continental Shelf on the abyssal plains. Ooze is a classifcation by composition, not grain size. Accordingly, considering grain size, ooze is mud but mud is not necessarily ooze. Sof mud is, commonly, improperly referred to as ooze.\nOPEN COAST Te coast that fringes the marginal sea, as distinguished from the coast that fringes inland waters. ORIGIN In surveying, the reference position from which angles or distances are reckoned. In cartography, (1) the point of intersection of the coordinate axes, from which the coordinates are reckoned; (2) the origin of coordinates is the point to which the coordinate values (0, 0) are assigned, irrespective of its position with reference to the axes; (3) the origin of coordinates is the point from which the computation of the elements of the coordinate system (projection) proceeds.\nORTHOMETRIC HEIGHT Te distance of a point above the geoid.\nORTHOGONAL Pertaining to or composed of right angles.\nORTHOPHOTOGRAPH A photographic copy, prepared from a perspective photograph, in which the displacements of images due to tilt and relief have been removed.\nORTHOPHOTOMAP A map made by assembling a number of orthophotographs into a single, composite picture.

OUTFALL A structure extending into a body of water for the purpose of discharging sewage, storm runof or cooling water.\nOUT-OF-RANGE Target echoes displayed by the sonar resulting from hard refectors that are beyond the system range setting. When an imaging sonar transmits an acoustic pulse, it propagates into the environment. Afer the pulse travels beyond the set range of the system, another pulse is transmitted. However, the frst pulse is still moving away from the transducer and sending back echoes. Even though those echoes are returning from out-of-range, this is not normally a problem because the sonar system gains are reduced in the near feld (for the second outgoing pulse).\n255\n\n\fIn a quiet environment, where there is little backscatter in the near feld and there are hard targets out of range, these targets will be imaged afer the second pulse starts its propagation. In radar, this phenomenon is called a \"second sweep return.\"\nOUTSIDE SOURCE DATA (OSD) Previously called Tird Party Data.

Planned overlap is useful to assure efcient 100% coverage of the seabed. Since a vessel's track line is not a perfectly straight line, overlap of one swath with a portion of the next will help ensure that there are no data gaps between tracks.\nOVERLAY 1. A printing or drawing on a transparent or semitransparent medium at the same scale as a map, chart, etc., to show details not appearing, or requiring special emphasis, on the original. 2. Additional data, or a pattern, printed afer the other features so as to \"overlay\" them. 3. A sheet containing explanatory or modifying data, placed over and keyed to the existing or basic copy. Sometimes used as a means of correcting the underlying copy.\nOVERPRINT Information printed or stamped upon a map or chart, in addition to that originally printed, to show data of importance or special use.\nOVER-THE-GROUND A measurement of the speed or course of a vessel with respect to the seabed, independent of movement in relation to wind or water.\n7.16 P\nPANTOGRAPH An instrument which makes use of the properties of a parallelogram, for the mechanical copying of drawings at a predetermined reduced (or enlarged) scale. Once used extensively within NOAA's chart production program to transfer information from a source map to a nautical chart. Te tool is no longer used, having been replaced by digital techniques, such as vector digitization.\nPARALLEL A circle (or approximation of a circle) on the surface of the Earth, parallel to the equator and connecting points of equal latitude.\nPARITY BIT A data bit, set at \"0\" or \"1,\" that provides information on whether the total number of bits in a data feld is even or odd. Tis is used to ensure data integrity and that no data is lost. PASS A single procession by a seabed anomaly during a sonar survey. Multiple passes by a target may be necessary for target classifcation and interpretation. For\n256\n\n\fexample, thermal discontinuities rarely look the same on any two passes. A target that may be a school of fsh can be properly identifed by multiple passes because fsh schools rarely stay in one place over any length of time.\nPASSAGE A narrow navigable channel, especially one through reefs or islands. Sometimes called a pass or, in New England waters, a hole.\nPASSING LIGHT A term applied to a lower candlepower light mounted on a light structure. Used where a mariner passes out of the main light beam (such as a range light) but still needs to keep the structure in sight during transit.\nPASSIVE SONAR A sonar system having only a hydrophone, and capable of receiving signals but not transmitting them.\nPATH-TRACKING Te ability of a towed body to accurately follow the path along which it is towed. In the absence of high velocity currents and using short cables, most side scan sonar towfsh will track along the ship's path well. However, if the sonar is towed at 90 degrees to a strong current and over long cable, it will tend to be displaced from the vessel's path and heading. See Lateral Ofset.\nP-CODE A term related to GPS signals. A bi-phase shif modulated on both the L1 and L2 carrier frequencies. P-code has a 10.23 MHz bit rate and, as implemented in GPS, has a period of 1 week.

A ball or cage is sometimes placed at the top of the perch as an identifying mark.\nPENINSULA A body of land jutting into and nearly surrounded by water, frequently (but not necessarily) connected to a larger body of land by a neck or isthmus.\nPERIOD Te interval of time necessary for a regularly recurring motion to make a complete cycle. Te period of a navigational light is the time taken to exhibit one complete sequence of intervals of light and darkness.\nPHASE Relative measurement describing the temporal relationship between two waves with the same frequency. Phase is measured in degrees, and one full oscillation cycle has 360 degrees. One way to think of phase is this: If two pendulums are swinging at the same frequency and are in the same position at the same instant, then they are in phase with each other.\n257\n\n\fPHOTOGRAMMETRIC COMPILATION Te production of a map or chart, or portion thereof, from aerial photographs and geodetic control data. When compilation involves stereo instruments, this is called stereocompilation.\nPHOTOGRAMMETRIC SURVEY A survey of a portion of the land surface utilizing aerial photographs and reduced to map form by stereoscopic or other instrumental equipment.\nPHOTOGRAMMETRY 1. Te science of obtaining reliable measurements from photographic images. 2. Te science of preparing charts and maps from aerial photographs using stereoscopic equipment and methods.\nPHOTOMOSAIC 1. An assemblage of photographs, each of which shows part of a region, put together in such a way that each point in the region appears once and only once in the assemblage, with scale variation minimized. A photomosaic is assembled by trimming, warping, and ftting together the individual photographs. If the photographs were taken at diferent heights, the individual photographs must be enlarged or reduced to a common scale. 2. An assemblage of parts of aerial photographs joined together to leave as few variations of scale as possible.\nPHOTOTRIANGULATION Te determination of horizontal or vertical coordinates from measurements of angle, distance, or coordinates of points on overlapping photographs. Phototriangulation is classifed as terrestrial or aerial, depending on whether the photographs were taken on the ground or from the air. Aerial phototriangulation is commonly called \"aerotriangulation.\"\nPIER A long, narrow structure extending into the water approximately perpendicular to a shore or a bank to providing berthing for ships, to serve as a promenade or place for other use, as a fshing pier.\nPIERHEAD Tat part of a pier or jetty projecting farthest into the water.\nPIERHEAD LINE Te line fxing the boundaries of the fairway to which wharf or pier structures (of open construction) may be built.\nPILE A long substantial timber or section of wood, concrete, or metal, forced into the earth or seabed to serve as a support, as a pier, or to resist lateral pressure.\nPILING Plural form of Pile.

Pipes will vary in diameter and length, and are ofen used as privately maintained aids to navigation.\nPITCH An instability in vessel or towfsh attitude expressed by the alternate rise and fall of the bow/nose and stern/tail about a horizontal axis.\nPLANE RECTANGULAR COORDINATES A system of coordinates in a horizontal plane, used to describe the positions of points with respect to an arbitrary origin. Te origin is established by a pair of axes which intersect at right angles. Te position of a point is determined by the perpendicular distances to these axes. Also call plane coordinates.\nPLANETABLE A surveying instrument used in topographic mapping by which the surveyor plots his survey in the feld directly from the observations, without the necessity of keeping notes for later ofce plotting. It consists essentially of a drawing board on a tripod to which the survey sheet is clamped and adjusted in the horizontal plane, an alidade (a telescope mounted on a metal, straight-edge ruler) for measuring directions and distances to salient features of the terrain, and a telemeter rod graduated for the optical measurement of distances from the observer.\nPLANIMETER A mechanical integrator for measuring the area of a plane surface.\nPLANIMETRIC SURVEY A survey which presents the horizontal position only for the features represented; distinguished from a topographic map by the omission of relief.\nPLAT A diagram drawn to scale showing land boundaries and subdivisions, together with all data essential to the description and identifcation of the several units shown thereon, and including one or more certifcates indicating due approval.

Te extreme end of a cape, or the outer end of any land area protruding into the water (less prominent than a cape). 2. A place having position, but no extent. 3. One thirty-second of a circle, or 11 \u00bc \u00b0. A cardinal point is any of the 4 principal directions, north, east, south, or west; an intercardinal point is any of the 4 directions midway between the cardinal points, northeast, southeast, southwest, or northwest. Also called compass points when used in reference to compass directions.\nPOINT FEATURE A point feature is a single point item such as a pile, wreck, rock, obstruction, etc. located at one specifc geographic location. Tis may include detached positions for data types such as bottom samples, sound velocity cast locations, navigational aids, feature disprovals, existing navigationally signifcant features, and AWOIS items.\nPOINT SYMBOL A symbol employed to indicate that a particular phenomenon occurs at, or a particular value may be attributed to, a specifc point on a map.\nPOLAR COORDINATES 1. A coordinate system based on a sphere. 2. An alternative system of marking a point on a plane by its radial distance (r) from an \"origin\" and a polar angle (f). When 3-dimensional polar coordinates overlap a Cartesian (x, y, z) system, q is the angle between the line to the origin and the z-axis, while f is the (counter-clockwise) angle between the projection of that line onto the (x,y) plane and the x-axis. Concerning(q, f), see also latitude and longitude, declination, azimuth and elevations. 3. An alternative to the usual Cartesian method of addressing image pixels. Polar coordinates use the coordinate pair, angle and radius from an origin instead of column and row. 4. A 2-D coordinate system used to locate a point in a plane by specifying a distance and an angle from the coordinate origin. If another distance normal to the coordinate origin is added, cylindrical coordinates can be specifed.\nPOLE An elongated rod of wood or metal driven into the bottom to serve a particular purpose. Of smaller diameter than a pile, but larger diameter than a stake.\nPOLYCONIC PROJECTION A map projection having the central geographic meridian represented by a straight line, along which the spacing for lines representing the geographic parallels is proportional to the distances between the parallels; the parallels are represented by arches of circles that are not concentric, but whose centers lie on the line representing the central meridian, and whose radii are determined by the lengths of the elements of cones which are tangent along the parallels. All meridians except the central ones are curved. Te projection is neither conformal nor equal area, but it has been widely used for maps of small areas because of the ease with which it can be constructed. Te origin\n260\n\n\fof the projection, at least in concept, is credited to Ferdinand R. Hassler, the frst Superintendent of the Coast Survey, and was used for all the hydrographic surveys of the agency until the 1990s.\nPONTOON BRIDGE A bridge supported on pontoons.\nPORT A place for the loading and unloading of vessels recognized and supervised for maritime purposes by the public authorities. Te term includes a city or borough for the reception of mariners and merchants, and therefore denotes something more than a harbor. A port may possess a harbor but a harbor is not necessarily a port. Any natural creek or inlet on the sea shore with adequate depth of water and sufcient shelter for ships fulflls the essential conditions of a harbor. To make it a port, in the accepted sense of the word, there must be additional accommodations and facilities for landing passengers and goods.\nPORT SERIES A series of reports, published jointly by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), the Maritime Administration (MARAD), and the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT). Te reports describe in detail pilotage information for the principal ports of the United States, as well as the facilities and services available to shipping at selected U.S. seaports.\nPOSITION Data which defne the location of a point with respect to a reference system. Te coordinates that defne a location. Te place occupied by a point on the surface of the Earth, or in space.\nPOSITION APPROXIMATE Of inexact position.

Usually shown by the abbreviation \"PA.\"\nPOSITION DOUBTFUL Of uncertain position. Te expression is used principally on charts to indicate that a wreck, shoal, etc., has been reported in various positions and not defnitely determined in any. Usually shown by the abbreviation \"PD.\"\nPOSITION NUMBERS Numbers historically assigned to a \"fx\" of the survey boat's position at one particular time, starting with number 1 at the beginning of the survey and continuing consecutively to the end of the survey.\nPOSITION REPORTED Te reported location of a feature. Usually, this refers to the geographic location of a feature that has been reported to proper authorities, such as the U.S. Coast Guard or local marine agencies. Usually shown on charts by the text \"reported.\"\nPOST A small beacon used for marking channels. Tis beacon is usually more substantial than a perch, and has a diameter larger than that of a stake but smaller than that of a pile.\nPOST-PROCESSING Data processing performed afer real-time data acquisition.\n261\n\n\fPOTABLE WATER INTAKE (PWI) A structure designed for the intake of drinking water. Te intake is usually elevated above the bottom, and supported and protected by a debris-screening structure (crib), usually a separately charted feature.\nPOUND NET A set net composed of vertical netting supported and held in place by stakes. It consists of three essential parts, the pot (pound, pocket, bowl), the wings or hearts, and the leader or lead. Te pound consists of a bag of stout netting with 1-in meshes the margin of which is supported by upright stakes. Te bottom of the pound is spread and secured by ropes which pass through loops near the lower end of the stakes. Te wings or heart are vertical fences of netting diverging from the entrance of the net. Te mesh is \u00bd -in and is supported by stakes. Te leader, which may vary in length from about 150 - 1,000 f or more, extends from shore or shallow water into deeper water, and defects the fsh towards the heart or wings.\nPRECAUTIONARY AREA A routing measure comprising an area within defned limits where ships must navigate with particular caution and within which the direction of trafc fow may be recommended.\nPRECISION Te degree of refnement of a value; not to be confused with its accuracy, which is the degree of conformance with the correct value.\nPREDICTED TIDES Tide levels that are predicted by combining the harmonic constituents over time at a particular tidal location.\nPRELIMINARY CHART A chart for which there is a requirement, but for an area in which some or all of the survey data does not meet modern standards. Te defciencies in such surveys may be due to small scale, out-moded, or non-standard survey techniques, outdated, unprocessed, or unapproved data, or other factors causing the survey data to fall below customary standards for the scale of the chart. A preliminary chart may or may not be published in full color. Included on the chart shall be a source diagram and a warning note stating that (all or much of) the hydrography shown on the chart is not of customary quality. Te chart will retain the \"Preliminary\" label until it has been recompiled using contemporary, processed, and approved source material, and all standard chart colors shown.\nPRELIMINARY SURVEY As used in historical NOAA terminology, this was a survey that was of higher order than a reconnaissance, but did not have the detail of a complete survey.\nPRIMARY GAUGE (Primary Control Water Level station) A water level station at which continuous observations have been made over a minimum of 19 years. Its purpose is to provide data for computing accepted values of the harmonic and nonharmonic constants essential to tide predictions and to the determination of tidal datums for charting an for coastal and marine boundaries. Te data series from these stations serves as a primary control for the reduction of relatively short series from subordinate tide stations through the method of comparison of simultaneous observations and for monitoring long-period sea level trends and variations.\nPRIME MERIDIAN Te meridian of longitude 0\u00b0, used as the origin for measurement of longitude. Te meridian of Greenwich, England, is almost universally used for this purpose.\n262\n\n\fPRINCIPAL MERIDIAN A true north-south line (a meridian), extending both north and south of the initial point in the rectangular system of surveys. Together with the base line, principal meridians constitute the axes of a system and the initial point of origin of that system.\nPRIVATE AIDS TO NAVIGATION In U.S. waters, those aids to navigation not established and maintained by the U.S. Coast Guard. Private aids include those established by other federal agencies with prior U.S. Coast Guard approval, those aids to navigation on marine structures or other works which the owners are legally obligated to establish, maintain, and operate as prescribed by the U.S. Coast Guard, and those aids which are merely desired, for one reason or another, by the individual corporation, state or local government, or other body that has established the aid with U.S. Coast Guard approval. Although private aids to navigation are inspected periodically by the U.S. Coast Guard, the mariner should exercise special caution when using them for general navigation.\nPROBABLE ERROR An error (or deviation from the mean) of such magnitude that the likelihood of its being exceeded in a set of observations is equal to the likelihood of its not being exceeded (50% probability); its value is that of the standard error multiplied by 0.6745. Te use of standard error is sometimes preferred {to probable error} in statistical studies.\nPROJECT INSTRUCTIONS A document issued by NOAA's Ofce of Coast Survey containing the unique requirements for a hydrographic survey project. It pertains only to those projects to be conducted by NOAA survey platforms and hydrographers and is not intended to be used by others working under contract. Tis term supersedes the term Letter Instructions.\nPROJECT/VESSEL/DAY/LINE (PVDL) Hierarchical format used to store CARIS hydrographic data.\nPROJECTION Te representation of a fgure on a surface, either plane or curved, according to a defnite plan. In a perspective projection this is done by means of projecting lines emanating from a single point, which may be infnity. In cartography, any systematic arrangement of meridians and parallels portraying the curved surface of the sphere or spheroid upon a plane. Also called map projection or chart projection.\nPROJECTOR A sonar transducer that translates electrical signals into pressure waves (sound signals), and transmits them through the water.\nPROLATE SPHEROID An ellipsoid of revolution, the major axis of which is the axis of revolution.\nPROOF In cartography, an advanced copy of a map produced to check the design, register and/or to enable errors to be detected and corrected before fnal printing.\nPROOF CHECKING Te examination of the proof and comparison with its sources to point out any errors, omissions, and necessary improvements.\n263\n\n\fPROPORTIONAL DIVIDERS An instrument consisting in its simple form of two legs pointed at both ends and provided with an adjustable pivot, so that for any given pivot setting, the distance between one set of pointed ends always bears the same ratio to the distance between the other set. A change in the pivot changes the ratio. Te dividers are used in transferring measurements between diferent charts or drawings that are not at the same scale.\nPROVISIONAL CHARTS A special chart for which there is an urgent need. Te chart is compiled from processed and approved source material and may be smooth drafed for direct reproduction. All charted information is combined on the black plate and no colors are shown. Te chart will retain the \"provisional\" label until all smooth drafed detail is engraved and standard chart colors are added.\nPUBLICATION NO. 9 American Practical Navigator; a publication of the NGA, originally by Nathaniel Bowditch, comprising an epitome of navigation and navigational astronomy and providing tables for solution of navigational problems. Popularly called Bowditch.\nPUBLIC LAW 31 (SUBMERGED LANDS ACT) An act passed during the 1st session of the 83rd Congress and signed into law on May 22, 1953. Confrms and establishes the titles of the states to lands beneath navigable water within their boundaries and to the natural resources within such lands and water. Te act also established jurisdiction and control of the United States over the natural resources of the seabed of the continental shelf seaward of state boundaries.\nPUBLIC LAW 212 (OUTER CONTINENTAL SHELF LANDS ACT) An act passed during the 1st session of the 83rd Congress and signed into law on August 7, 1953. Provides for the jurisdiction, control, and administration by the United States over the submerged lands seaward of the states' boundaries as defned in Public Law 31, that is, over the outer continental shelf.\nPUBLISHER'S NOTE A marginal note which indicates the publisher and usually the place of publication.\nPULSE A short burst of sonar, typically measured as a function of time, distance, or power. Each pulse of sonar is also known as a ping.\nPULSE LENGTH Te length of time that an active sonar is transmitting one pulse, typically expressed in milliseconds. Longer pulse lengths allow more power to be put into the water at the expense of across track resolution. Tis has the efect of gaining range for large area surveying.\nPULSE WIDTH Te distance of the ensonifed water, in the range dimension, at a given point in time, expressed in meters and determined by multiplying the pulse length by the speed of sound through the water. Pulse widths are measured to determine the maximum theoretical resolution of an imaging sonar.\nPUMPING PLATFORM COMPLEX (PPC) A single platform or a series of inter-connected platforms that have one or more of the following capabilities: (1) Pumping oil between a vessel and the shore; (2) berthing and messing facilities for assigned personnel; (3) a landing area for helicopters; (4) mooring and loading for small vessels.\n264\n\n\f7.17 Q\nQUAD A commonly used slang expression for \"quadrangle.\" Te term used to refer to a topographic map published by the U. S. Geological Survey.\nQUALITY ASSURANCE A continuing evaluation of the quality control process. It is not a double check on each product, but rather a \"check on the checkers.\" Quality assurance techniques ofen employ a statistical sampling method to examine just enough of the products to determine that the quality control system is efective. Quality assurance is not intended to catch all the defciencies, but only to determine if the rates of defciencies that pass through the quality control system are within the acceptable limits established by management. Any problem identifed by the quality assurance process should result in corrective action in the quality control process. Since quality assurance evaluates part of the production system, i.e., quality control, it must be organizationally separately from the production manager in order to ensure objectivity.\nQUALITY CONTROL A routine inspection to insure that the product conforms with certain minimum standards and specifcations that have been established by management. Quality control is usually performed at the work site by supervisors or by designated inspectors. Products that fail to meet the minimum standards are reprocessed or destroyed.\nQUALITY CONTROL REPORT Historically, a report comprising a critique of the quality and adequacy of the feld data acquisition and processing of a given survey. Signifcant errors, conficts, or discrepancies which cannot be expeditiously corrected in the records or on the smooth sheet were discussed, and appropriate recommendations regarding corrective action were included in the report. During the period from October 1975 through September 1982, all hydrographic surveys were subjected to a quality control inspection.\nQUAY A structure approximately parallel to the shoreline and accommodating ships on one side only, the other side being attached to the shore. It is usually of solid construction, as contrasted with the open pile construction usually used for piers. A similar facility of more open construction is called a wharf.\nQUENCH Te loss of a sonar signal, most ofen due to water-borne discontinuities and resulting in blank sonar display areas. Quenching will afect both the outgoing sonar pulse and the returning echoes.\nQUENCHING Te great reduction in underwater sound transmission or reception resulting from absorption and scattering of sound energy by air bubbles entrapped around the sonar dome.\n7.18 R\nRACE Swifly fowing water in a narrow channel or river; also the channel itself, which may be artifcial, as in a mill-race. Also, a swif rush of water through a narrow channel in tidal waters, caused by the tidal movement of the waters.\nRADIO ACOUSTIC RANGING (RAR) A method of position determination in ofshore hydrographic surveying which utilized underwater sound\n265\n\n\ftransmission and radio to determine the distance of the survey vessel from two or more known stations. Tis method was discontinued during World War II and has since been superseded by electronic methods.\nRADIO BEACON Electronic apparatus which transmits a radio signal to provide a line of position for marine navigation.\nRAMP A sloping structure that can be used, either as a landing or launching place, at variable water levels, for small vessels, landing ships, or amphibious airplanes, or for hauling a cradle carrying a vessel.\nRANDOM ERROR An error whose occurrence depends on the laws of chance only. Random errors are typically very small with a mean value of zero.\nRANGE 1. In hydrographic positioning, the distance between the vessel or observer and a remote control station or range measuring instrument. 2. In navigation, two or more objects in a line. Such objects are said to be in a range. An observer having them in range is said to be on the range. Two beacons are frequently located for the specifc purpose of forming a range to indicate a safe route or the centerline of a channel. 3. When referring to side scan sonar, a sonar setting which represents a distance, usually measured in meters, that is the maximum distance from the towfsh that the sonar will display (the range setting on the sonar also determines the time between outgoing sonar pulses); also synonymous with the across-track dimension. Once the range setting on the system is set, when returning echoes arrive from that distance away from the transducer, the ping cycle starts again and a new acoustic pulse is transmitted in to the water.\nRANGE-AZIMUTH A method of determining a geographic position using both (a) the range or distance from a control point to a survey vessel, and (b) the azimuth or direction as observed from the same control point to that vessel.\nRANGE OF TIDE Te diference in height between consecutive high and low waters. Te mean range is the diference in height between mean high water and mean low water.\nRANGE RESOLUTION Te ability of the sonar to image, separately and distinctly, objects perpendicular to the towfsh heading. Te range resolution is determined, in part, by the pulse length of the sonar. A short pulse length will display two targets close together as separate and distinct anomalies. Te same two targets, when ensonifed by a longer pulse length can be simultaneously enveloped by the pulse. Tis results in the two objects appearing as one in the sonar display.\nRASTER A matrix of row and column data points whose values represent energy being refected or emitted from the object being viewed. Tese values, or pixels, can be viewed on a display monitor as a black and white or a color image. Raster images are made up of individual dots, each of which has a defned value that precisely identifes its specifc color, size, and place within the image. Unlike a vectorized raster, which contains attributed information, a raster image does not contain any feature information. Also known as a bitmapped image.\nRAY BENDING See Refraction\n266\n\n\fREACH Te comparatively straight segment of a river or channel between two bends. Tat part of a winding river between the last bend and the sea is called a sea reach; that part between the harbor and the frst bend is called the harbor reach.\nREAL TIME KINEMATIC (RTK) A DGPS process where GPS carrier-phase (which delivers the most accurate GPS information) corrections are transmitted in real-time from a reference receiver at a known location to one or more remote rover receivers.\nRECIPROCAL BEARING A bearing difering by 180\u00b0, or one measured in the opposite direction, from a given bearing.\nRECOGNITION Te acknowledgment by the sonar operator of the existence of a target or anomaly as displayed in the sonar data. Lack of anomaly recognition can be problematic particularly during side scan sonar operations. Catastrophic towfsh altitude loss, severe fsh instability, and search targets all should be recognized by the operator any time they occur. Recognition is distinguished from detection as being operator-dependent. See Detectability.\nRECONNAISSANCE SURVEY A hasty preliminary survey of a region made to provide some advance information regarding the area which may be useful to the mariner, pending the execution of more complete surveys.\nRECONSTRUCTED CHART Tis term is used when the accumulation of new charting information is sufciently extensive enough to afect most of an existing chart. Tis may also occur if there are changes to the chart limits or if the chart is to be recompiled on a new projection using computer-supported compilation and scribing techniques.\nRECOVERY OF STATION In surveying, the identifying and checking of an original station. Tis is considered as recovered when its mark (monument) is identifed as authentic and proved to be occupying its original site.\nRECREATIONAL CHARTS Tese agency charts are a series of large-scale charts providing sequential page coverage for selected Great Lakes areas. Tese charts are published in book format with each page being a large-scale, small-sized chart.\nRECTANGULAR COORDINATES Magnitudes defning a point relative to two perpendicular lines called axes. Te magnitudes indicate the perpendicular distance from each axis. Te vertical distance is called the ordinate and the horizontal distance the abscissa. Tis is a form of Cartesian coordinates.\nREDUCTION OF SOUNDINGS Te correction of observed depths for instrument errors, systematic bias, sound velocity variation, draf and water level above datum.\nREEF A rocky or coral elevation which may be dangerous to surface navigation, sometimes uncovering at the sounding datum. A rocky reef is always detached from shore; a coral reef may or may not be connected with the shore.\nREFERENCE LINE Any line which can serve as a reference or base for the measurement of other quantities. Also called a datum line.\n267\n\n\fREFERENCE MARK In surveying, a supplementary mark of permanent character close to a station or to a base terminal, to which it is related by an accurately measured distance and direction, and/or a diference in elevation.\nREFERENCE POINT Any point which can serve as a reference or base for the measurement of other quantities. Also called a datum point.\nREFERENCE SPHEROID (OR ELLIPSOID) A theoretical fgure whose dimensions closely approach the dimensions of the geoid. Te exact dimensions are determined by various considerations of the section of the Earth's surface considered. Te Spheroids of Bessel, Clarke, Delambre, Everest, Hayford, Helmett, and others have been adopted as reference spheroids in geodetic work by diferent countries.\nREFLECTING PROJECTOR An instrument by means of which the image of a photograph can be projected onto a map. By varying the position of the projector lens, the scale of the projected image can be varied.\nREFRACTION Te change of direction of a sound beam when passing obliquely from one medium into another, where its wave velocity is diferent. Refraction is a type of ray bending that will afect acoustic returns for proper sonar imaging. Tis occurs when sonar pulses encounter thermal and haline discontinuities. In a normal summer thermocline environment, a side scan beam can be refracted sharply to the seafoor, severely limiting range.\nREGISTER MARKS Designated marks, such as small crosses, circles, or other patterns applied to original copy prior to reproduction to facilitate registration of plates and to indicate the relative positions of successive impressions. Also called corner marks, corner ticks, register ticks, registration ticks, or ticks.\nREGISTRATION Correct positioning of one component of a composite map image in relation to the other components. Map registration (also called geo-referencing) is the process of converting fle or page coordinates to map coordinates. For example, a scanned map can have an origin point and a raster association where each point on the map is identifable by its fle coordinates, whether by numerals or by pixels. Te task is to then convert these numeral coordinates to map coordinates (e.g., latitude, longitude: x, y).\nREGISTRY NUMBER A number assigned to topographic and hydrographic surveys within NOAA for identifcation and fling purposes. Topographic surveys are identifed by a variety of designations, depending on vintage, e.g., \"T,\" \"TP,\" \"DM,\" and \"GC.\" Hydrographic surveys are similarly identifed with designations such as \"H,\" \"FE,\" \"S,\" and \"D.\" Registry numbers beginning with the letter \"W\" are used to identify surveys originating with sources other than those under the direct administrative control of NOAA.\nREMOTE HEAVE Te apparent vertical motion of a sensor due to vessel roll and/or pitch acting on a lever arm between the sensor and the vessel's center of motion.\nREPEATABILITY A measure of the variability of a series of measurements of the same quantity/position/depth. High repeatability is indicative of high precision.\n268\n\n\fREPRESENTATIVE FRACTION (RF) Te scale of a map or chart expressed as a fraction or ratio that relates unit distance on the map to distance measured in the same unit on the ground. Also called natural scale, fractional scale.\nREPRINT A reprinting of a chart without revision, necessitated by the depletion of stock. Te issue is an exact duplicate of the current issue with no changes in printing or publication dates.\nRESIDUAL ERROR Te diference between any value of a quantity in a series of observations, corrected for known systematic errors, and the value of the quantity obtained from the adjustment of that series. Sometimes called residual.\nRESTRICTED AREA A specifed area designated by appropriate authority and shown on charts within which navigation is restricted in accordance with certain specifed conditions.\nRESTRICTED WATERS Areas which for navigational reasons, such as the presence of shoals or other dangers, confne the movements of shipping within narrow limits.\nRETRACTABALE BRIDGE A bridge with a movable span that can be withdrawn horizontally or within the remaining structure of the bridge.\nREVERBERATION Te echoing of a sonar signal from a target or targets. Echo and reverberation are ofen used interchangeably, although targets are more ofen described as returning an echo whereas large ensonifed areas such as the seafoor are described as reverberating under the infuence of sonar.\nREVETMENT A retaining wall or facing constructed of riprap or concrete, etc., built to protect an embankment or shore structure against erosion by wave action or currents.\nREVIEW Te fnal step in the processing of the feld data or a hydrographic survey. Its purpose was to consider the survey in its broader aspects, to correlate it with all prior surveys of the agency covering the same area, with historical data that may have been received from other sources, and to lay the foundation for future surveys in the area because of indicated changes, inadequate development, or conficting information. In 1982, this step was efectively merged into a process called Evaluation, the results of which are documented in an Evaluation Report. See also Review Report, Verifer's Report.\nREVIEW REPORT A report, formerly prepared in agency headquarters, which summarizes pertinent facts relating to a given hydrographic survey. Included in the report are sections which address the quality of the hydrographic survey and detailed comparisons made with prior hydrographic surveys and the appropriate nautical charts. Included in the report are specifc evaluations and recommendations regarding the adequacy of the survey to supersede prior survey data and charted information. Te formal review function was transferred to the Ofce of Marine Operations in October, 1975, and the former \"Review Report\" was renamed the \"Verifer's Report.\" See Review, Evaluation Report, and Verifer's Report.\n269\n\n\fREVISED PRINT A chart issue that does not cancel a current edition; the revisions are minor and the edition number remains the same, but the print date is changed, and the chart is designated a revised print of that chart. Te date of a revised print is shown to the right of the edition date.\nRHUMB DISTANCE Te length of the tack a ship makes when sailing from one place to another without changing course.\nRHUMB LINE A line on the surface of the earth making the same oblique angle with all meridians; a loxodrome or loxodromic curve spiraling toward the poles in a constant true direction. Parallels and meridian, which also maintain constant true directions, may be considered special cases of the rhumb line. A rhumb line is a straight line on a mercator projection.\nRIFFLE A shoal, reef, or shallow in a stream, producing a stretch of rufed or choppy water.\nRIGHT BANK Te river bank on the right-hand side as one proceeds downstream.\nRINGING In a transducer, this is the reception of the transducer output pulse at the time of transmission. In active sonar systems, the projector and the hydrophone are one and the same, so the hydrophone receives its own outgoing pulse. In a target, this is a well-documented phenomenon resulting from multiple echoes from certain types of targets due to the acoustical physics of sound pulse wrap-around and refections internal to the target.\nRIPARIAN BOUNDARIES Water boundaries, or boundaries formed by the sea or a river. Te general rule is that riparian boundaries shif with changes due to accretion or erosion but retain their original location. Such changes may be due to rapid erosion of the shoreland by waves during a storm, sudden cutting of of land by food, currents, or change in course of a body of water, or by artifcial causes.\nRIP-RAP A layer, facing, or protective mound of stones or similar durable material, emplaced as in a revetment to prevent erosion, scouring, or sloughing of a structure or embankment.\nRISE A long, broad elevation that rises gently and generally smoothly from the sea foor.\nRIVER A natural stream of water, of greater volume than a creek or rivulet, fowing in a more or less permanent bed or channel, between defned banks or walls, with a current which may either be continuous in one direction or afected by the ebb and fow of the tide.\nROAD An open anchorage afording less protection than a harbor. Some protection may be aforded by reefs, shoals, etc. Ofen used in the plural. Also called roadstead.\n270\n\n\fROADSTEAD An area of the sea used for the anchorage of vessels and transshipment of cargo, usually without the protection from weather associated with ports and harbors. Roadsteads are part of the territorial sea but are not inland waters.\nROCK An isolated rocky formation or a single large stone, usually one constituting a danger to navigation. It may be always submerged, always uncovered, or alternately covered and uncovered by the tide.\nROCK AWASH In tidal areas, a rock that uncovers, or nearly uncovers, near the vertical datum of reference prescribed for that area. See Sunken Rock.\nROCKY AREA An area with a rocky bottom.\nROLL Te rhythmic movement of a ship or towbody about its longitudinal axis.\nROOT MEAN SQUARE ERROR See Standard Error.\nROTATION Turning of a body about an axis within the body, as the daily rotation of the Earth.\nROV Acronym for Remotely Operated Vehicle (submersible), an unmanned underwater vehicle that is connected to an operator via a power and/or communication tether. See AUV.\nROUTE CHARTS Nautical charts produced by the agency and designed for river and narrow waterway coverage, and for much of the Intracoastal Waterway. Tey are published in the small-craf pocket fold format.\nRUINS A ruin is a structure in a decayed or deteriorated condition resulting from neglect or disuse, or a damaged structure in need of repair. A ruin is considered hazardous if it extends over or into navigable waters and thus represents a danger to surface navigation.\nRUB-TEST Te process of manually creating friction on a transducer face in order to test system electrical continuity. Before a sonar towbody is put in the water, it is a common practice to test the system on deck. Because air is a high impedance medium for sonar, the best method of testing system function is to rub the transducer face. In a dual channel side scan sonar, one transducer is rubbed, then the opposite is rubbed to clarify that the transducers are not wired to the wrong display channels.\n7.19 S\nSAILING CHARTS Charts of scales 1:600,000 and smaller for planning and for fxing the mariner's position as she approaches the coast from the open ocean, or for sailing between distant coastwise ports. Te shoreline and topography are generalized\n271\n\n\fand only ofshore soundings, principal navigational lights and buoys, and landmarks visible at considerable distances are shown.\nSAILING DIRECTIONS Publications similar in scope to the Coast Pilots of the agency, published by other hydrographic ofces.\nSALINITY A measure of the quantity of dissolved salts in sea water. It is normally defned as the total amount of dissolved solids in sea water in parts per thousand (0/00) by weight when all the carbonate has been converted to oxide, the bromide and iodide converted to chloride, and all organic matter is completely oxidized. In practice, salinity is not determined directly but is computed from chlorinity, electrical conductivity, refractive index, or some other property whose relationship to salinity is well established.\nSAND An unconsolidated mixture of inorganic soil (which may include disintegrated shells and coral), consisting of small but easily distinguishable grains ranging in size from about 0.062 mm to 2.0 mm.\nSANDING An irregular dot pattern used on some of the early hydrographic surveys to accentuate the area between the highand low-water lines.\nSAND SPIT A narrow embankment, created by an excess of deposition at its seaward terminus, with its distal end (the end away from the point of origin) terminating in open water.\nSAND WAVES 1. Longshore sand waves are large-scale features that maintain form while migrating along the shore with speeds on the order of kilometers per year. 2. Large-scale asymmetrical bedforms in sandy river beds having high length to height ratios and continuous crestlines.\nSATELLITE POSITIONING SYSTEM A positioning system consisting of a radio-receiver, or a receiver and transmitter, at the point whose location is to be determined, one or more beacons or transponders in orbit about the Earth, and a computing system for determining and predicting the orbits. Te satellites can be considered points of known location. Te radio receiver may measure times of travel of radio pulses, directions to the satellites, or the Doppler shif in the frequency of the radio waves emitted by the satellites. Te most common system used today is the Global Positioning System (GPS).\nSCALE Te relation that a measured distance on a survey, map, or chart bears to the corresponding actual distance on the earth; for example, if 1 inch on the survey or chart corresponds to 1,000 f (12,000 inches) on the ground, the scale would be expressed as 1 inch = 1,000 f. Expressed as a ratio, this would be a scale of 1:12,000.\nSCALE BAR A graduated line on a map, plan, photograph, or mosaic, by means of which actual ground distances may be determined.\nSCALE FACTOR A multiplier for reducing a distance obtained from a map by computation or scaling to the actual distance on the datum of the map.\n272\n\n\fSCALE MARKS Equidistant, regular marks on a sonar display used to assist in the mensuration of targets above the seafoor, or to provide information on the range displacement of targets from a side scan sonar towfsh path.\nSCATTERING Te difusion of a sonar signal in many directions through refraction, difraction and refection, primarily due to the material properties of the ensonifed areas. Scattering is one of the causes of attenuation in sonar, resulting in signal weakening. See Backscatter.\nSEA 1. A large body of salt water, second in rank to an ocean, more or less landlocked, and generally part of, or connected with, an ocean or a larger sea. 2. State of the surface of the ocean or lake with regard to wave or swell, as a calm sea.\nSEABOARD Te region of land bordering the sea. Te terms seaboard, coast, and littoral have nearly the same meanings. Seaboard is a general term used somewhat loosely to indicate a rather extensive region bordering the sea. Coast is the region of indefnite width that extends from the sea inland to the frst major change in terrain features. Littoral applies more specifcally to the various parts of a region bordering the sea, including the coast, foreshore, backshore, beach, etc.\nSEA BUOY Te outermost buoy marking the entrance to a channel or harbor.\nSEA CLUTTER Te images created in a sonar display by acoustic returns from a rough sea surface. When using side scan sonar, some energy is projected above the horizontal from the wide vertical beam. If the sea surface is rough and within the range setting of the system, formless patches may overlay the normal seabed returns.\nSEAFLOOR Te bottom of the ocean when there is a generally smooth gentle gradient. Also referred to as the sea bed or sea bottom.\nSEA GRASS Members of marine seed plants that grow chiefy on sand or sand-mud bottom. Tey are most abundant in water less than 9 m deep. Te most common varieties are: eel grass, turtle grass, manatee grass.\nSEA MILE An approximate mean value of the nautical mile equal to 6080 feet, or the length of a minute of arc along the meridian at latitude 48\u00b0.\nSEAMOUNT An isolated or comparatively isolated elevation rising 1000 meters or more from the seafoor and of limited extent across the summit.\nSEA STATE Te numerical or written description of ocean surface roughness. For more precise usage, sea state may be defned as the average height of the highest one-third of the waves observed in the wave train.\n273\n\n\fSEAWALL A structure built along a portion of a coast primarily to prevent erosion and other damage by wave action. It retains earth against its shoreward face.\nSEA WATER Te water of the seas, distinguished from fresh water by its appreciable salinity. Te degree of salinity greatly afects the water's physical characteristics.\nSECCHI DISK Circular disk used to measure the transparency of the water column.\nSECONDARY GAUGE (Secondary Control Water Level Station) A water level station at which continuous observations have been made over a minimum period of 1 year but less than 19 years. Te series is reduced by comparison with simultaneous observations from a primary gauge. Tis station provides for a 365-day harmonic analysis including the seasonal fuctuation of sea level.\nSECONDARY PHASE FACTOR CORRECTION A correction for additional time (or phase delay) for transmission of a low-frequency signal over an all-seawater path when the signal transit time is based on the free-space velocity. Te LORAN-C lattices as tabulated in tables or overprinted on the nautical chart normally include compensation for secondary phase factor.\nSEDIMENT Loose fragments of rocks, minerals, or organic material that are transported from their source for varying distances and deposited by air, wind, ice, and water. Other sediments are precipitated from the overlying water or form chemically in place. Sediment includes all the unconsolidated materials on the sea foor.\nSELECTIVE AVAILABILITY (SA) Selective Availability is a process once used by the U.S. Department of Defense to dither the satellite clock and/or broadcasts erroneous orbital ephemeris data to create a pseudo range error to prevent adversaries from using the extremely accurate GPS positioning data.\nSEMIDIURNAL Having a period or cycle or approximately one-half of a tidal day. Te predominant type of tide throughout the world is semidiurnal, with two high waters and two low waters each tidal day.\nSEPARATION ZONE A zone or line separating trafc proceeding in one direction from trafc proceeding in another direction. A separation zone may also be used to separate a trafc lane from the adjacent inshore trafc zone.\nSET Te direction toward which a current fows.\nSETTLEMENT Vertical displacement of a moving vessel, relative to what its level would be were it motionless. Settlement is due to the regional depression of the surface of the water in which the ship moves. It is not an increase in displacement. At low speeds the efect of moving the hull through the water causes a local depression in the water surface around the hull. Te efect of increasing speed on vessels with planing hulls is to cause them to lif out of the water. Not to be confused with squat which is the change in vessel trim as it moves through the water.\n274\n\n\fSEXTANT A double-refecting instrument used for measuring angles, primarily horizontal angles between two objects when used in hydrographic surveying. Te sextant has an arc of 60 degrees, a sixth of a circle, from which it derives its name.\nSEXTANT FIX (also called a Tree-Point Fix) A position determined by measuring with a sextant 2 adjacent angles between 3 objects whose relative positions are known.\nSHADED RELIEF A cartographic technique that provides an apparent 3-dimensional confguration of the terrain on maps and charts by the use of graded shadows that would be cast by high ground if light were shining from the northwest.\nSHADOW A light area on a normal sonar record that is less ensonifed than the surrounding region; most ofen caused by signal blocking from an acoustically opaque object on or above the seafoor. Shadows in side scan data are an important aid to accurate record interpretation. Ofen, an acoustic shadow will divulge more about a refector than the actual acoustic returns. Shadows are also used to calculate the height of an object standing proud of the seabed. Te calculation uses an algebraic solution of similar triangles formed by the height of the towfsh, the range to the target and the length of the shadow.\nSHALLOW WATER Water of such depth that surface waves are noticeably afected by bottom topography. Typically, this implies a water depth equivalent to less than half the wave length. Recent usage extends the defnition of shallow water seaward to those depths deemed signifcant to surface navigation \u00ad 30 to 40 meters.\nSHALLOW WATER MULTIBEAM (SWMB) A multibeam echosounder system designed specifcally for shallow water operations.\nSHINGLE Rounded, ofen fat waterworn rock fragments larger than approximately 16 millimeters.\nSHIPPING LANE A term used to indicate the general fow of merchant shipping between two departure/ terminal areas.\nSHOAL 1.(n) A detached area of any material except rock or coral. Te depths over such an area are a danger to navigation, i.e., minimal depths are 11 fm ( 20 m) or less. Shallow areas consisting of coral or rock are referred to as reefs, rather than as shoals. 2. (verb) To become shallow gradually. 3. (adj.) Shallow.\nSHORE According to riparian law, the land between ordinary high- and low-water marks, where the common law prevails; the land over which the daily tides ebb and fow. Te civil law concept of shore has been interpreted as extending to the line of mean higher high tide as it intersects land and some man-made features. See Foreshore and Riparian Boundaries.\nSHORELINE Te line of contact between the land and a body of water. On NOAA nautical charts and survey sheets, the shoreline approximates the mean high-water (MHW) line. In OCS, this term is sometimes considered to be synonymous with coastline but the use of the term coastline is discouraged.\n275\n\n\fSHORELINE MAP Te graphic representation of photogrammetric surveys. Te maps contain graphic data relating to the shoreline, and alongshore natural and man-made features, and may include a narrow zone of such features inland from the shoreline. Te original sources of a shoreline map are aerial photographs, but may also include ground survey data. Shoreline maps are generated primarily to support hydrographic operations and nautical chart compilation and maintenance. Also called Shoreline Manuscript.\nSHORELINE PLANE OF REFERENCE (SPOR) Te vertical datum accepted as the reference plane for shoreline, typically MHW.\nSIDE SCAN SONAR (SSS) A form of active sonar in which fxed acoustic beams are directed into the water perpendicularly to the direction of travel to \"scan\" the bottom and generate a record of the bottom confguration.\nSILL A submarine ridge or rise of relatively shallow depth separating the sea foor of adjoining basins.\nSILT Sediment particles with a grain size between 0.004 mm and 0.062 mm, i.e., coarser than clay but fner than sand.\nSINGLE BEAM ECHO SOUNDER (SBES) An echo sounder that transmits and receives only one sound pulse at a time; contrasted to a multibeam echo sounder which records multiple soundings over a swath of the seafoor for each transmission. See Vertical Beam Echo Sounder (VBES)\nSKEWED PROJECTION Any standard projection used in map or chart construction, which does not conform to a general north-south format with relation to the neat lines of the map or chart. Alternatively called rotated projection.\nSLACK WATER Te state of a tidal current when its speed is near zero, especially the moment when a reversing current changes direction and its speed is zero. Te term is also applied to the entire period of low speed near the time of turning of the current when it is too weak to be of any practical importance in navigation. Te relation of the time of slack water to the tidal phases varies in diferent localities.\nSLANT RANGE Te straight-path time of arrival of a sonar signal along the hypotenuse of a triangle described by the towfsh, the seafoor directly below it, and the seabed point of interest. In side scan sonar, because the imaging source point (transducer) is not on the seafoor but rather above it, slant range does not represent the true range between any 2 objects. Below the towfsh, the data is compressed. Farther away from the towfsh, the data becomes less compressed, with the least error at the outermost ranges. Te near range compression can be corrected for most modern sonar systems.\nSLANT RANGE CORRECTION A computerized repositioning of sonar data on the display to counteract range data compression. See Slant Range.\nSLIP See Dock.\nSLIP RING An electromechanical component, most ofen used on a winch that allows full electrical continuity of a side scan\n276\n\n\fsonar cable during winch drum operation. Poor quality or dirty slip rings will cause noise in sonar data during drum movement and a bad individual ring can cause a blank sonar channel.\nSLOUGH A small muddy marshland or tidal waterway which usually connects 2 or more bodies of water. See Bayou.\nSMALL CRAFT CHARTS Agency nautical charts at scales from 1:10,000 to 1:80,000 that are designed for easy reference and plotting in limited spaces. In some areas these charts represent the only chart coverage for all marine users. Tey portray regular nautical chart detail and other specifc details of special interest to small-craf operators, such as enlargements of harbors; tide, current, and weather data; rules-of-the-road information; locations of marine facilities; anchorages; courses; and distances.\nSMALL SCALE A scale involving a relatively large reduction in size. A small-scale chart is one covering a large area. Te opposite is large-scale. In agency usage, a scale of 1:105,000 (1 inch on survey sheet or chart = 105,000 inches on the ground) or smaller would fall in this classifcation. See Large-scale survey (chart).\nSMOOTH SHEET Te name given to a plotted representation of data acquired during a hydrographic survey. Essentially, it is a record of the soundings taken during the feld survey, but historically it contained other data necessary for a proper interpretation of the survey, such as depth curves, bottom characteristics, names of geographic features, and control stations.\nSNAG A tree, tree stump, or tree branch embedded in the bottom of a body of water, thereby constituting a hazard to navigation or to fshing gear, e.g., nets. A snag may be submerged, awash, or visible at mean high water.\nSNIPPET Tat portion of the backscatter time series that fall within the footprint of an individual beam from a multibeam sonar. Tis results in a geo-referenced high resolution sidescan image.\nSONAR GEOMETRY Te spatial relationship between sonar transducers and their environment, including the seafoor, targets, and the sea surface. Because of acoustic paths in the ocean environment, sonar imagery may be puzzling at times. Accurate data interpretation sometimes requires an understanding of the sonar geometry. A good example of this is when sonar signals return to the transducer over several diferent paths. See Multipath.\nSONARGRAM A hard copy display of sonar data (typically from side scan) generated either in real time or from recorded data. Also known as sonographs/sonograms, hard copy \"records\" of side scan sonar data are generated either by a sonar printer, a specialized graphics printer or, with modern computerized sonar displays, by any drafing printer in color or black and white. Early sonar printers used a wet paper technology creating dark and light zones on the paper. Dry paper recorders were developed in the 1970's followed by thermal paper recorders in the 1990's. Many sonar manufacturers and users now depend upon digitally recorded data.\nSONOGRAPH See Sonargram. SOUND 1. (n) A relatively long arm of the sea or ocean forming a channel between an island and a mainland or connecting two larger bodies, as a sea and the ocean, or two parts of the same body, usually wider and more extensive than a strait. 2. (v) To measure the depth of the water.\n277\n\n\fSOUNDING A measured depth of water; or the act of measuring depth.\nSOUNDING LINE Te path followed by a vessel during the acquisition of soundings.\nSOUNDING LINE CROSSINGS Te intersection of two systems of sounding lines at which the depths must agree within specifed limits. See= Crosslines.\nSOUNDING MACHINE A historically used instrument for measuring depth of water, consisting essentially of a reel of wire to one end of which is attached a weight which carries a device for recording the depth. A crank or motor is provided for reeling the wire.\nSOUNDING POLE A graduated pole for sounding in shallow water.\nSOUNDING RECORDS Historically consisted of bound record books in which all of the data taken during a hydrographic survey were entered, and became part of the permanent records of the agency. A typical sounding record of a launch hydrographic survey using an echo sounder and 3-point fx control contained position numbers, times of taking the soundings, uncorrected soundings, corrections to be applied, reduced soundings, boat's headings by compass, position control data, and pertinent remarks. Soundings acquired during a modern survey are routinely fled in digital form. Te modern sounding record contains a variety of information, depending on the particular system in use.\nSOUND VELOCITY Te rate at which acoustic energy moves through a medium. Tis term is ofen used incorrectly instead of the more technically precise term speed of sound. Te rate at which sound energy moves through water is a scalar quantity and has no specifed direction. Hence, speed is the more correct term since velocity is a vector and implies direction. See speed of sound.\nSOURCE MATERIAL Data of any type required for the compilation of NOAA products including, but not limited to, ground control, aerial and terrestrial photographs, sketches, maps, and charts; topographic, hydrographic, hypsographic, magnetic, geodetic, oceanographic and meteorological information; and intelligence documents and written reports pertaining to natural and man-made features of the area to be mapped or charted.\nSOUTHEAST ALASKA DATUM An independent horizontal datum established toward the end of 1901 by joining together 9 diferent groups of triangulation to form 1 continuous scheme on one datum. Applied to all triangulation in Alaska between Dixon Entrance and Mount St. Elias.\nSPECULAR REFLECTOR An object to which incident sonar beams are largely normal to its surface, making it a strong refector from a variety of angles. Objects in this category include cylindrical objects such as pipes and pilings, and spherical objects such as subsurface foats. Specular refectors may provide very strong sonar returns and will result in hyperbolic shaped lines in side scan data. Te hyperbola is formed when a target is refective enough to return even the low level energy in the side lobes of the sonar's horizontal beam.\n278\n\n\fSPEED Rate of motion. Te terms speed and velocity are ofen used interchangeably, but speed is a scalar, having magnitude only, while velocity is a vector quantity, having both magnitude and direction.\nSPEED CORRECTION Te proportional matching of sonar recorder chart length with the over-the-ground speed of the survey vessel. When towing side scan sonar at a constant speed over the bottom, if the image generation on the recorder or display unit is too slow, objects in the data will appear to be compressed in the transverse dimension. If the image generation is too fast, they will appear to be stretched.\nSPEED OF SOUND Te rate at which acoustic energy moves through a medium. Te speed of sound in sea water is a function of temperature, salinity, and the changes in pressure associated with changes in depth. An increase in any of these factors tends to increase the speed. Ofen incorrectly referred to as Sound Velocity - velocity is a vector and implies direction and the speed of sound is a scalar quantity as it has no specifed direction. See also Speed and Velocity.\nSPHERICAL EXCESS Te amount by which the sum of the 3 angles of a triangle on a sphere exceeds 180\u00b0.\nSPHEROID A type of ellipsoid which is formed by revolving an ellipse about one of its axes. If the minor axis is the axis of revolution, the resulting fgure is called an oblate spheroid (ellipsoid) which approximates the shape of the earth. In geodesy, this term is frequently used to mean reference spheroid.\nSPIKE Sharp deviation from a line, caused by erroneous data or an anomalous event.\nSPIRE A slender pointed structure surmounting a building such as a church. Sometimes depicted as a landmark on nautical charts.\nSPIT A long narrow accumulation of sand or shingle, lying generally in line with the coast, with one end attached to the land and the other projecting into the sea or across the mouth of an estuary.\nSPLIT 1. In wire-drag surveying, an area between drag strips not covered by the drag. 2. In hydrographic surveying, one or more sounding lines accomplished between mainscheme lines to provide a more detailed development or to eliminate a holiday in coverage.\nSPOIL Mud, sand, silt, or other deposits obtained from the bottom of a body of water (usually a channel or harbor) by dredging.\nSPOIL AREA An artifcial formation created by the deposit of dredged materials on the seabed. Spoil banks that are connected to the natural coastline are part of the baseline from which maritime zones are measured. Tose that are unattached are artifcial islands and are not part of the baseline. Alternatively, spoil bank.\n279\n\n\fSQUAT A change in vessel trim as it moves through the water. Tis change of level of the bow and stern from a still water condition is in response to the elevation and depression of the water level about the hull resulting from the bow and sternwave systems. Not to be confused with settlement which is the vertical displacement of a moving vessel, relative to what its level would be were it motionless.\nSSS Acronym for Side Scan Sonar.\nSTACK A tall smokestack or chimney. Te term is used on nautical charts when the stack is more prominent as a landmark than the accompanying buildings.\nSTAKE An elongated wood or metal pole embedded in the bottom. A stake plotted on a hydrographic survey is assumed to be wooden unless otherwise annotated. Its diameter is smaller than that of a pole.\nSTANDARD (for charts) A fle begun about 1908 by means of which a record is kept of all incoming charting information, except aids to navigation. Te fle consists of a complete set of the published charts. When an individual Standard becomes cluttered with annotations, it is fled and replaced with another chart, which then becomes the contemporary Standard. Te fle is an invaluable source of historical information and is used in the preparation of project instructions. Also called a Chart Standard.\nSTANDARD ERROR Te square root of the arithmetic mean of squared deviations from the mean. Also called standard deviation (when the deviations do not represent errors) or root mean square error. In statistics, the standard error is defned as the standard deviation of an estimate. Tat is, multiple measurements of a given value will generally group around the mean (or average) value in a normal distribution. Standard error is a common measure of the uncertainty associated with a numerical estimate. In a regression analysis, standard errors are ofen reported with (or below) the coefcient estimates. As a rough rule of thumb, one can be 95% confdent that the true coefcient is within \u00b12 standard errors of the estimate.\nSTANDARD PARALLEL A parallel of latitude which is used as a control in the computation of a map projection. For a tangent cone, this is the parallel of tangency. For a secant cone, the two parallels of intersection are the standards.\nSTANDPIPE A tall cylindrical structure in a waterworks system, whose height is several times greater than its diameter. It extends from the ground and may be supported by a skeleton-type framework. Sometimes depicted as a landmark on nautical charts.\nSTATE PLANE COORDINATE SYSTEM One of the plane rectangular coordinate systems (one for each State in the Union), established by the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey in 1933 for use in defning locations of geodetic stations in terms of plane-rectangular Cartesian coordinates.\nSTATUTE MILE 5280 f, 1609.3 meters, or 80 chains. Also known as a \"land mile\" or \"English mile.\"\n280\n\n\fSTRAIT A relatively narrow waterway between two larger bodies of water.\nSTRAND 1. Te portion of the seashore between high and low water line. 2. To run aground. Te term strand usually refers to a serious grounding, while the term \"ground\" refers to any grounding, however slight.\nSTRANDED Te terms \"stranded\" and \"sunken\" apply exclusively to items that once were afoat but are now resting on the bottom. \"Stranded\" items project above the sounding datum, while \"sunken\" items do not project above the sounding datum. Tese terms apply most ofen to wrecks. Masts, funnels, and other extensions of wreck superstructure should be disregarded when applying the above defnition; i.e., such features may project above the sounding datum and still have the wreck classifed as \"sunken.\" See Sunken.\nSTRANDING Te destruction or loss of a vessel by its being sunk or broken up by the violence of the sea or by its striking or stranding upon a rock, shoal, etc. Te term stranding refers particularly to the accidental or voluntary driving or running aground of a vessel.\nSTRUCTURE Te term includes, without limitation, any pier, wharf, dolphin, weir, boom, breakwater, bulkhead, revetment, riprap, jetty, permanent mooring structure, power transmission line, permanently moored foating vessel, pile(s), aid to navigation, or any other obstacle or obstruction.\nSUBMARINE CABLE An insulated, waterproofed wire or bundle of wires for carrying an electric current under water. Such a cable is placed on or near the bottom.\nSUBMERGED Under water; not showing above water (commonly used to refer to features covered at MLLW). Tis term applies to objects and features that never possessed the ability to foat and are now attached to, or resting on, the bottom. All items in this category, except rocks, reefs, and rock or reef formations, are submerged if they are totally below the shoreline datum.\nSUBMERGED LANDS ACT See Public Law 31.\nSUBORDINATE GAUGE (Subordinate Water Level Station) A water level station from which is a relatively short series of observations is reduced by comparison with simultaneous observations from a water level station with a relatively long series of observations.\nSUBSIDENCE Sinking or down warping of a part of the earth's surface.\nSUNKEN Te terms \"sunken\" and \"stranded\" apply exclusively to items that once were afoat but are now resting on the bottom. \"Stranded\" items project above the sounding datum, while \"sunken\" items do not project above the sounding datum. Tese terms apply most ofen to wrecks. Masts, funnels, and other extensions of wreck superstructure should be disregarded when applying the above defnitions; i.e., such features may be above the sounding datum and still have the wreck classifed as \"sunken.\" See Stranded.\n281\n\n\fSUNKEN ROCK A rock potentially dangerous to surface navigation, the summit of which is below the lower limit of the zone for a rock awash. See Rock Awash.\nSURDEX An index of polygons defning the limits of sounding coverage obtained during a hydrographic survey conducted or sponsored by the agency. Te fgures are contained within a geographic information system. See Survey Indices (Indexes).\nSURF Collective term for breakers. Te wave activity in the area between the shoreline and the outermost limit of breakers.\nSURVEY Te act or operation of making measurements for determining the relative position of points on, above, or beneath the Earth surface. Te result of such operations.\nSURVEY INDICES (INDEXES) Printed sheets showing the dates, areas covered, and scales of planetable and hydrographic surveys along the Atlantic, Gulf, and Pacifc coasts to include Alaska and Hawaii. Historically, the indexes were maintained manually, but in more recent times digital technology has begun to replace the system with information maintained in a geographic information system. Also referred to as Surdex.\nSWAMP A tract of stillwater abounding in certain species of trees and course grass or boggy protuberances; a tract of wet, spongy land, saturated, but not usually covered with water; a boggy marshland and stream.\nSWATH WIDTH Te lateral coverage of sonar on the seabed. Because a sonar projects a beam(s) laterally to the vessel heading, it creates a wide region of ensonifed seafoor. Swath width changes with depth and is a factor in determining coverage and lane spacing.\nSWEEP To drag. \"Drag\" and \"sweep\" have nearly the same meanings. In NOAA usage, a drag was typically deployed when the objective was to locate and ascertain the minimum clearance depth over an obstruction. A sweep was used when the objective was simply to verify that no obstructions existed in a channel or waterway. It was not efective in determining clearance depths. See Wire Drag.\nSWMB See Shallow Water Multibeam.\nSYSTEMATIC ERROR Biases in measurement which lead to measured values being systematically too high or too low. All measurements are prone to systematic error. A systematic error is any biasing efect, in the environment, methods of observation or instruments used, which introduces error into an experiment and is such that it always afects the results of an experiment in the same direction. Constant systematic errors are very difcult to deal with, because their efects are only observable if they can be removed. Such errors cannot be removed by repeating measurements or averaging large numbers of results. A common means to remove systematic error is the observation of a known process, i.e. through calibration. Another means to remove systematic error is by a subsequent measurement with more sophisticated experiment equipment.\n282\n\n\f7.20 T\nTABLES FOR A POLYCONIC PROJECTION OF MAPS Special Publication No. 5, U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, contains the true lengths in meters of meridional arcs and arcs of the parallel, as they appear on the Clarke spheroid of 1866, for use in the construction of projections, together with the \"x, y \" coordinates for plotting the intersection of parallels and meridians in constructing a polyconic projection. Te tables are based on the legal value of the meter in the United States, which is 39.3700 inches, and corresponds to 1 m = 3.2808333 f and 1 f = 0.3048006 meters. Also referred to as Table of Meridional Parts.\nTAGLINE A line, either marked at equal intervals or run over a registered sheave, used in large-scale surveys to take equally spaced soundings at predetermined distances from a control station or known location, e.g., a pier face.\nTANK In NOAA usage, a fxed structure for storing liquids. Sometimes depicted as a landmark on nautical charts.\nTERMINAL MORAINE A moraine formed across the course of a glacier at its farthest advance, at or near a relatively stationary edge, or at places marking the termination of important glacial advances.\nTERRITORIAL LIMITS Te seaward or most ofshore limits of a littoral or coastal nation over which it has exclusive jurisdiction.\nTERRITORIAL SEA Te water area bordering a nation over which it has exclusive jurisdiction, except for the right of innocent passage of foreign vessels. It extends seaward from the low-water mark along a straight coast and from the seaward limits of inland waters where there are embayments. Tese waters commonly extend to 12 nautical miles from the coast, per the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.\nTERRITORIAL WATERS Includes the territorial sea (marginal seas) and the inland waters of a country (lakes, rivers, and bays, etc.). Sometimes used as synonymous with Territorial Sea.\nTERTIARY GAUGE (Tertiary Tide Station) A water level station at which continuous observations have been made over a minimum period of 30 days but less than 1 year. Te series is reduced by comparison with simultaneous observations from a secondary control water level station. Tis station provides for a 29-day harmonic analysis.\nTHEODOLITE A precise surveying instrument, consisting of an alidade with a telescope mounted so that it can be rotated about a vertical axis; the amount of rotation is measured on an accurately graduated, stationary horizontal circle. See also transit.\nTHERMOCLINE A layer of water where the vertical temperature gradient is greater than that in the water above it or in the water below it. Termoclines afect the ray path of acoustic signals underwater and can result in a range-limiting type of banding visible in side scan sonar data. Similar to the efects of a haline front, this banding is most evident at the outer ranges of sonar data where the beam's angle of incidence to the thermocline is high. Changing the sonar geometry will minimize or eliminate the efects of thermoclines.\n283\n\n\fTHREE-ARM PROTRACTOR An instrument (metal or plastic) for plotting sextant fxes in hydrographic surveying. It consists of a graduated circle with a fxed center arm and right and lef movable arms pivoted at its center so that the extension of each fducial edge always passes through the precise center of the graduated circle. Te observed lef angle is set with the lef arm and the right angle with the right arm, and each fducial edge is made to pass through the corresponding control station on the survey sheet. Te center of the protractor marks the position of the survey boat.\nTHREE POINT FIX METHOD One of the principal methods used historically on inshore hydrographic surveys for establishing the position of the survey boat. It involves the measurement with sextants of two angles between three known stations, the middle station being common to both angles, and plotting the boat's position graphically with a three-arm protractor.\nTIDAL BENCH MARK A bench mark near a tide station to which the tide staf and tidal datums are referred.\nTIDAL DATUM A base elevation used as a reference from which to reckon heights or depths specifcally defned in terms of a certain phase of the tide. Tidal datums are local datums and should not be extended into areas which have difering hydrographic characteristics with substantiating measurements.\nTIDE Te periodic rise and fall of the water resulting from gravitational interactions between Sun, Moon and Earth. Te vertical component of the particulate motion of a tidal wave.\nTIDE GAUGE Also referred to as a water level gauge. A device for measuring actual water levels. It can be a simple as a graduated staf in the water where visual observations can be made or it may consist of an elaborate recording instrument making a continuous graphic record of water levels over time. Until recent technological advances, most tide gauges were actuated by a foat in a pipe communicating with the sea through a small hole which flters out shorter waves.\nTIDE LANDS Te zone between the mean high-water line and the mean low-water line, commonly referred to as the \"beach.\" Waters above the tidelands are inland, being landward of the coastline.\nTIDE RANGE See Range of Tide.\nTIDE STATION See water level station.\nTIME VARIED GAIN (TVG) A process where amplifer gain is changed based on time and matched with the returning signals between outgoing pulses of a sonar. Because of attenuation of a sonar beam, the receiver gain must be increased as the acoustic returns from greater and greater distances arrive at the transducer. Because these returns are received over a predictable and consistent time, the gains can be increased over a time curve. In many sonar systems, this curve can be adjusted by the operator.\nTOP MARK A characteristic shape secured at the top of a buoy or beacon to aid in its identifcation.\n284\n\n\fTOPOGRAPHIC MAP A map which presents the vertical position of features in measurable form, as well as their horizontal positions.\nTOPOGRAPHIC SURVEY As used in NOAA, a record of a survey, of a given date, of the natural features and the culture of a portion of the land surface and their delineation by means of conventional symbols. Alternately, it is the original feld survey sheet and is the authority for the high-water line and all information inshore of that line, including geographic names of topographic features.\nTOTAL PROPAGATED Uncertainty(TPU) TPU is an estimate of the uncertainty of any individual sounding, taking into account the error estimates of the component measurements (tide, sound speed, draf, range measurement, angle measurement, attitude, ofsets, etc), and expressed as a separate value in horizontal and vertical planes. Te uncertainty is sometimes expressed as a variance (in meters2) but more ofen as a confdence level (in meters) based on the assumption that the uncertainty is a Gaussian distribution. In the latter case, a specifcation of the level of confdence (e.g., \"at 95% CI\"') must be appended for correctness and completeness. Horizontal uncertainties are generally expressed as a single 'Circular Error Probable' (CEP) value implying a symmetric distribution of uncertainty in the plane. Note that `error' could be considered a misnomer, as there is no implication that the sounding is incorrect, just that its true value is uncertain.\nTP SHEET (MAP) Te term \"TP Sheet\" refers to photogrammetric surveys planned and executed afer 1968. Photogrammetric surveys of the \"TP\" series are graphically depicted in the form of a shoreline map. Shoreline maps of the \"TP\" series generally depict shoreline in detail. In special survey projects, the shoreline map may consist of the base map and one or more overlays. \"TP\" stands for Topographic Photogrammetry.\nTRACK Te actual path or route of a craf over the ground or sea bottom, or its graphic representation.\nTRAINING WALL A structure built alongside a channel to direct the tidal stream or currents through the channel to promote a scouring action.\nTRANSDUCER Te electromechanical component of a sonar system that is mounted underwater and converts electrical energy to sound energy and vice versa. Te transducer formation determines the beam shape and is the basis for image formation in side scan sonar.\nTRANSFORM To change the form of data according to specifed rules, without signifcantly changing the meaning of the data.\nTRANSIT A surveying instrument composed of a horizontal circle graduated in circular measure and an alidade with a telescope which can be reversed in its supports without being lifed therefrom. Also, the act of making such reversal. A theodolite having a telescope that can be transited in its supports is a transit, and is sometimes termed a transit theodolite. All modern theodolites are transits. See theodolite.\nTRANSVERSE MERCATOR PROJECTION A projection of the cylindrical type, being in principle equivalent to the regular Mercator Projection turned 90\u00b0\n285\n\n\fin azimuth. In this projection, the central meridian is represented by a straight line, corresponding to the line which represents the equator on the regular Mercator Projection. Neither the geographic meridians, except the central meridian, nor the geodetic parallels, except the equator (if shown), are represented by straight lines. It is a conformal projection. Also called transverse cylindrical orthomorphic projection.\nTRANSVERSE RESOLUTION Te ability of the sonar to image, as separate and distinct, objects that lay in a line parallel with a side scan sonar towfsh track. Transverse or along-track resolution is determined, in part, by the horizontal beam width of the sonar. A narrow beam width will display two targets close together as separate and distinct anomalies. Te same two targets, when ensonifed by a wider beam, can be simultaneously enveloped by the single outgoing pulse. Tis can result in the two objects appearing as one in the sonar display. Transverse resolution decreases with range from the towfsh because of beam spreading.\nTRAVERSE A route and a sequence of points on it at which observations are made; or the route, the points, and the observations at those points; or the process by which the route and sequence are established. In particular, a survey traverse. Unless specifcally stated otherwise, a traverse is horizontal, i.e., a procedure for determining only the horizontal coordinates of the points in the traverse.\nTRIANGULATION A method of surveying in which the stations are points on the ground at the vertices of a chain or network of triangles, whose angles are observed instrumentally and whose sides are derived by computation from selected triangle sides called base lines, the lengths of which are obtained from direct measurement on the ground.\nTRILATERATION A method of extending horizontal control where the sides of triangles are measured rather than the angles as in triangulation.\nTRIGGER PULSE Te signal provided to sonar transducer fring circuitry to initiate the outgoing pulse; also, two parallel lines on the center of a side scan sonar record that represent the position of the fsh in relation to the sonar image. Many sonar displays sense the trigger pulse in order to synchronize other subroutines with the trigger. Because the display of the trigger pulse in data is caused by transducer fring, it is useful in system troubleshooting.\nTRUE NORTH Geographic or astronomic north; coincides with the true meridian rather than magnetic north.\nT- SHEET Planetable topographic and certain photogrammetric surveys conducted by the agency and its predecessors during the period 1834 - 1980. Tese surveys were recorded graphically in the form of a map which should be referred to a \"topographic survey\" or \"shoreline map,\" as appropriate.\nTURBIDITY Reduced water clarity resulting from the presence of suspended matter. Water is considered turbid when its load of suspended matter is visibly conspicuous, but all waters contain some suspended matter and therefore are turbid. As turbidity increases, the maximum depth that water penetrating bathymetric LIDAR can measure decreases.\nTURNING BASIN A water area used for turning vessels.\n286\n\n\fTVG See Time Varied Gain.\nTWO POINT FEATURE A cartographic feature that can be positioned with 1 set of coordinates describing its location and a second set of coordinates defning its orientation.\n7.21 U\nUNALASKA DATUM An independent datum in Alaska used along the south coast of the Alaska Peninsula from Cape Kuyuyukak to Umnak Island.\nUNITED STATES STANDARD DATUM Te frst standard geographic datum adopted by the Coast and Geodetic Survey for all the triangulation in the United States. It was adopted on March 13, 1901, and is defned by station Meades Ranch, whose position on the Clarke spheroid of 1866 is: Latitude 39\u00b0 13' 26.686\", longitude 98\u00b0 32' 30.506\", and azimuth to station Waldo 75\u00b0 28' 14.52\".\nUNIVERSAL TRANSVERSE MERCATOR (UTM) GRID A military grid system based on the transverse Mercator map projection, applied to maps of the earth's surface extending to 84\u00b0N and 80\u00b0S.\nUPPER LIMIT OF NAVIGATION Te character of a river will, at some point along its length, change from navigable to non-navigable. Very ofen that point will be at a major fall or rapids, or other place where there is a marked decrease in the navigable capacity of the river. Te upper limit will therefore ofen be the same point traditionally recognized as the head of navigation, but may, under some of the tests described above, be at some point yet farther upstream.\nUUV Acronym for Unmanned Underwater Vehicle. Tere are two categories of UUVs, AUVs and ROVs. See AUV and ROV.\n7.22 V\nVALDEZ DATUM Vicinity of Cape St. Elias to Wide Bay on the Alaska Peninsula, and for the triangulation around Kodiak sland.\nVARIATION Te angle between the magnetic and geographic meridians at any place, expressed in degrees and minutes east or west to indicate the direction of magnetic north from true north. Also called magnetic declination.\nVELOCIMETER Same as Velocity Profler.\nVELOCITY A vector quantity equal to speed in a given direction.\n287\n\n\fVELOCITY PROFILE Te gradient of acoustic velocity in water displayed as a graph of distance below the sea surface against the speed of sound. Tis term is ofen used incorrectly instead of speed-of-sound profle, when referring to a scalar magnitude rather than a vector quantity.\nVELOCITY PROFILER An instrument used for the \"in situ\" measurement of the speed-of-sound in the sea and other natural waters. Also called velocimeter.\nVERIFICATION As used in NOAA, the process by which a hydrographic survey undergoes a check of the feld observations. It deals primarily with a specifc survey and its accompanying records, and with correlating it to other contemporary surveys.\nVERIFIED WATER LEVELS Recorded 6-minute water level observations that have undergone both rudimentary data consistency checks in the CO-OPS Data Processing and Analysis System (DPAS) and verifcation by a technician at CO-OPS. Any gaps in data will have been recovered or interpolated from other gauge data. Verifed water levels have been reduced to MLLW.\nVERIFIER'S REPORT Te renamed, but approximately equivalent, successor to the \"Review Report.\" On the transfer of the formal hydrographic survey review to the Ofce of Marine Operations in October, 1975, it was considered appropriate to revise the title of the report, although the format and content remained essentially unaltered. Efective October 1,1982, the title of this report was again revised to \"Evaluation Report.\" Te \"Review Report,\" \"Verifer's Report,\" and \"Evaluation Report\" are essentially equivalent documents, i.e., they serve the same purpose. See Evaluation Report and Review Report.\nVERTICAL BEAM ECHO SOUNDER (VBES) A term created by NOAA hydrographers to identify the dual-frequency, dual beam width nature of nonmultibeam depth measuring sonars. Although the transducer of Vertical Beam Echo Sounders is not gyro-stabilized (a requirement for a true single beam vertical echo sounder) it is assumed that through all vessel motions where depth measurements are taken a portion of the wider beam is indeed vertical. See Single Beam Echo Sounder (SBES)\nVERTICAL CONTROL Term used to describe points with established elevations relative to a specifc vertical datum which are used as fxed references for surveying and/or mapping activities.\nVERTICAL DATUM Any level surface taken as a surface of reference from which to reckon elevations. A level surface is one which, at every point, is perpendicular to the direction of gravity, i.e., an equipotential surface. Te geoid, or in general, any surface parallel to it, is a level surface. In order that they may be recovered when needed, such datums are referenced to fxed points known as bench marks.\nVESSEL Te term \"vessel\" includes every description of watercraf or other artifcial contrivance used, or capable of being used, as a means of transportation on the waters of the U.S.\n288\n\n\fVESSEL CONFIGURATION FILE (VCF) A digital fle used to set the parameters for sensors and other equipment for data processing. See HIPS Vessel File (HVF)\nVESSEL REFERENCE UNIT (VRU) See Motion Reference Unit (MRU).\n7.23 W\nW SURVEY A hydrographic survey originating from outside the administrative control of the agency; alternately referred to as outside source data. Tese data are considered to have the potential to be applied to nautical charts. Tey are assigned a registry number consisting of the \"W\" prefx followed by a 5-digit numerical identifer, e.g., W00001.\nWAAS See Wide Area Augmentation System.\nWATER COLUMN A vertical section of water from the surface to the bottom. Typically used when describing sonar performance, characteristics, and corrections.\nWATER LEVEL GAUGE See Tide Gauge.\nWATER LEVEL STATION Te geographic location at which water level observations are conducted. Also, the facilities used to make water level observations. Tese may include a tide house, tide gauge, tide stall, and tidal bench marks. Also referred to as a tide station.\nWATERFRONT Land at the end of a stream, harbor, etc.; the part of a city or town on such land; a wharf or dock area.\nWATERLINE 1. Te line marking the junction of water and land. Tis line migrates, changing with the tide or other variation of the water level. Also written as two words. 2. Te line marking the junction of water and the hull of a vessel.\nWATERWAY A water area providing a means of transportation from one place to another, principally a water area providing a regular route for water trafc, such as a bay, channel, passage, or the regularly traveled parts of the open sea. Te terms waterway, fairway, and thoroughfare have nearly the same meanings. Waterway refers particularly to the navigable part of the water area. Fairway refers to the main traveled part of a waterway. A thoroughfare is a public waterway.\nWAVELENGTH Te distance, measured in the direction of propagation, between 2 successive points in a wave that are characterized by the same phase of oscillation. In sonar technology, along with the transmit power of a sonar, the wavelength (directly related to sonar frequency) will determine the ultimate range of the system. Decreases in wavelength (increases in frequency) bring higher resolution with the tradeof of reduced range.\n289\n\n\fWAY POINT 1. A mark or place at which a vessel is required to report or establish its position. 2. A notable point, ofen the point at which course changes, in a planned vessel route.\nWD See Wire Drag.\nWEIR A fence-like structure set in a stream or along a shoreline to catch fsh. It difers from a pound because it is mainly constructed of brush hedging or narrow boards with or without nettings. Coastal weirs are generally built where there is a large expanse of ground lef uncovered at low water. Weirs are usually kept in position all year round.\nWELL HEAD A submarine structure projecting some distance above the seabed and capping an oil or gas well on which drilling activity has been temporarily abandoned or suspended.\nWHARF A structure of open, rather than solid, construction parallel to the shoreline, providing only one face, which serves as a berthing place for vessels, and which generally provides cargo-handling facilities. A similar facility of solid construction is called a quay. A structure extending into the water with accommodations for vessels on both sides is called a pier.\nWIDE AREA AUGMENTATION SYSTEM (WAAS) Te Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) is a network of 25 ground reference stations, ranging from the US to Canada to Mexico, which monitor GPS satellite information and create a GPS correction message. Tis correction accounts for GPS satellite orbit and clock drif plus signal delays caused by the atmosphere and ionosphere. Te corrected diferential message is then broadcast through one of two geostationary satellites, or satellites with a fxed position over the equator. A WAAS-corrected signal can result in a GPS positional accuracy of within 3 meters.\nWINTER MARKER A lighted or unlighted buoy without sound signal, which is established as a replacement during the winter months when other aids are closed or withdrawn due to potential severe weather conditions such as ice.\nWIRE DRAG An apparatus once used in hydrographic surveying for determining the maximum clearance depth. It also was used for the detection of isolated dangers to navigation which might escape detection by ordinary sounding methods, e.g., rocks, pinnacles, ledges, boulders, coral reefs, etc. It consisted of a horizontal bottom wire supported at intervals ranging from 300 - 600 f by adjustable upright cables suspended from buoys on the surface and towed at the desired depth by 2 ships or launches. Tese uprights could be lengthened or shortened for various required depths. Tey were kept in a nearly vertical position by means of weights attached to their ends. Te end weights and buoys were larger than the intermediate weights, and buoys and the towing gear was attached to them.\nWIRE-DRAGGED AREAS Areas that have been swept to a safe depth with the wire drag. Symbolized on nautical/navigational charts by a green tint.\nWIRE-DRAG SURVEY A hydrographic survey utilizing wire drag apparatus.\n290\n\n\fWIRE SWEEP A modifcation of the wire-drag apparatus. Drag and sweep have nearly the same meanings. Te wire sweep was similar to the wire drag, difering only in the length of dragged sections between buoys. It consisted of end buoys and intermediate buoys set at intervals of 2,000 - 2,500 f. It was used in areas where the general depth was considerably greater than the depths to be investigated and where few, if any, obstructions were believed to exist. Te sweep could be set out more quickly and required less equipment than the wire-drag apparatus. Te use of the sweep would not necessarily indicate closely the position of any obstruction encountered, due to the great distances between buoys. In addition, the sweep depth would be only an approximation because of the sag of the bottom-wire between buoys.\nWORLD GEODETIC SYSTEM 1984 (WGS 84) WGS 84 is comprised of a consistent set of parameters describing the size and shape of the earth, the positions of a network of points with respect to the center of mass of the earth, transformations form major geodetic datums, and the potential of the earth. It represents the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency's (NGA's) modeling from a geometric, geodetic, and gravitational standpoint using data, techniques, and technology available in 1984. Satellite positions, including GPS observations, are based on WGS 84 which is both an ellipsoid and a datum.\nWRECK Te ruined remains of a vessel which has been rendered useless, usually by violent action of the sea and weather, on a stranded or sunken vessel. In hydrography, the term is limited to a wrecked vessel, either submerged or visible, which is attached to or afoul of the bottom or cast up on the shore. In nautical cartography, wrecks are designated visible, dangerous, or non-dangerous according to whether they are above tidal datum, less than, or more than 20 m (66 f; 11 fm) below tidal datum, respectively.\nWRECKAGE Goods or parts of a wrecked vessel either washed ashore, afoat, or submerged and resting on the bottom; i.e., the remains of a wreck.\nWRECK BUOY A buoy marking the position of a wreck. It is usually placed on the seaward or channel side of the wreck and as near to the wreck as conditions will permit. To avoid confusion in some situations, 2 buoys may be used to mark the wreck. Te possibility of the wreck having shifed position due to sea action between the times the buoy was established and later checked or serviced should not be overlooked.\n7.24 X\nX-AXIS A horizontal axis in a system of rectangular coordinates; that line on which distances to the right or lef (east or west) of the reference line are marked, especially on a map, chart, or graph.\n7.25 Y\nY-AXIS A vertical axis in a system of rectangular coordinates; that line on which distances above or below (north or south of) a reference line are marked, especially on a map, chart, or graph. Te line which is perpendicular to the X-axis and passes through the origin.\n291\n\n\fYARD A fundamental unit of length in the English system of measurement. Te metric equivalent prior to July 1, 1959, was 1 yd = 0.914440183 m. On that date, the value was changed to 1 yd = 0.9144 m. YAW An instability characterized by the side-to-side movement of a ship or towed body about its vertical axis. Vessel and towfsh yaw most ofen occur at low speeds and with quartering seas. Towfsh yaw is distinctive in sonar data.\n7.26 Z\n\"ZERO\" SOUNDINGS Soundings that reduce to heights above the sounding datum but are shown on the smooth sheet as zero soundings, regardless of height; a practice followed prior to 1860.

Material Standard lead line material is mahogany-colored tiller rope with a phosphor-bronze wire center. The center consists of six strands of seven 33-B (S-gage) wires each. The wire core is flexible and should not break after continual use and coiling. The rope is size 8 (about 0.24 in. in diameter), and is made of waterproofed, solid braided, long-staple cotton. The braid should be tight enough so that broken wire strands will not protrude through the covering and injure a leadsman's hands. Material for lead lines may either be requisitioned from the Marine Centers or be purchased from a well-equipped marine supply dealer.\nII. Fabrication and Marking Depending on the depths in which they will be used and on the size of the vessel, lead lines should be 30 to 60 meters long. Each lead line is identified by a consecutive number stamped on a metal disk attached at the inboard end of the line. Identification is made when a line is initially graduated. This number is to be retained throughout the life of the lead line or until re-marking is necessary. The braided covering of an unseasoned lead line tends to shrink when wet causing the wire core to buckle and the strands to break. Broken strands are likely to protrude through the covering and cause hand injuries. To prevent rupturing the core with repeated use, pre-season each lead line as follows:\n1. Prepare the lead line by soaking it in salt water for 24 hours. Then, while the line is still wet, work the cotton covering along the wire by hand until the wire protrudes from the covering. The wire should protrude about 1/3 meter for each 20 meters of line. This is a tedious procedure requiring the cooperative efforts of several people. The covering can be pushed back and slackened only a few inches at a time; this length of slack must be pushed nearly the full length of the line before the next small section can be started. The excess protruding wire is cut off. The covering must not be worked back too far, or it will form bulges along the wire. Lead lines so prepared will maintain an almost constant length for future use.\n2. Next, the line is dried under tension (about 50 lb) and then soaked again for 24 hr. Never boil a lead line as this destroys the waterproofing of the cover.\n3. After attaching a lead to the line, the line should be wetted down again and placed under a tension equal to the weight of the lead; this tension is maintained while the line is being graduated. Temporary marks made at this time can be used for later permanent marking. Graduation marks on a new lead line may be laid off with a steel tape. The best method, however, is to mark the distances permanently on a suitable surface such as on the deck of a ship or on a wharf if the survey party is shore based. Permanent markings are convenient when verifying the graduations in the future. Lead lines for NOAA hydrographic surveys should be graduated in meters, with intermediate marks to permit readings to the nearest decimeter. Each meter should be marked by a seizing of black thread, with a leather strip clearly indicating the numerical value for even meter intervals. Each even decimeter (0.2,\n\n\f0.4, 0.6, and 0.8) is marked by a seizing of white thread. Odd tenth readings are estimated. Waxed linen thread should be used to secure marks to the lead line in such a manner that there can be no possibility of slippage. Do not insert the thread through the braided covering of the line.\nIII. Verification When checks of traditional lead lines are made, the lead lines must be wet and under a tension equal to the weight of the attached lead in water. The testing standard should be a good recently calibrated steel tape or pre-measured graduation marks on deck or ashore. Replace or re-mark lead lines if the errors exceed 0.1 meter.\nIV. Sounding Leads Each survey unit should have one or more leads. Leads come in standard weights of 5, 7, 9, 14, and 25 lb are requisitioned from the Marine Centers. Various methods may be used to attach the lead to the lead line. The preferred method is to have a galvanized thimble at the lower end of the lead line to which the lead can be attached by a shackle.\nTraditional Sounding Pole Construction\nI. Material A sounding pole is made from a 5 meter length of 1.5 inch (3.81 cm) round lumber capped with a weighted metal shoe at each end to hasten sinking. Shorter poles may be used depending on the depth conditions.\nII. Fabrication and Marking Any convenient system of marking that is symmetrical toward both ends and will minimize reading errors may be used. The following marking system is recommended:\nMark each meter and even decimeter graduation (0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8) permanently by cutting a small notch in the pole. Paint the entire pole white; then paint odd decimeter graduation marks black.\nIII. Verification Sounding poles must be verified against a known standard, such as a survey quality metal tape, to ensure that depth markings are unambiguous and accurate.\n\n\fLead Line & Sounding Pole Calibration Report\n\nField unit:\n\nLead Line / Sounding Pole Identification Number: (Unique Identifier, with equipment type, date made, etc. )\n\nDate of Calibration:\n\nMethod of Calibration:\n\n\n\nOther\n\nLocation:\n\nChief of Party:\n\nLead Line / Sounding Pole Unit of Measure: Meters (This should always be meters!)\n\nMeasured by:\n\nRecorded by:\n\nChecked by:\n\nGraduated Marking (a)\n\nCalibration Measurement (b)\n\nLead Line Corrector (c = b - a)\n\n\fUNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\nNATIONAL OCEAN SERVICE Office of Coast Survey Silver Spring, Maryland 20910-3282\n\nMEMORANDUM FOR: FROM:\n\n(to be dated when signed)\nJeff Ferguson Chief, Hydrographic Surveys Division or\nHoward Danley Chief, Navigation Services Division\nLCDR Joseph Hydrohead, NOAA Commanding Officer, NOAA Ship SWATH\n\nSUBJECT:\n\nNOAA Ship SWATH Hydrographic Systems Status Summary\n\nThe hydrographic systems of NOAA Ship SWATH were reviewed in accordance with the Office of Coast Survey Field Procedures Manual (FPM) Hydrographic Systems Readiness Review procedures on January 28, 2010. The review process took place at NOAA's Marine Operations Center in Norfolk, Virginia, and was conducted by a Hydrographic Systems Review Team comprised of the following people: Lieutenant Jane Doe, HSTP Field Support Liaison Lieutenant Ida Know, Field Operations Officer, NOAA Ship SWATH Mr. Thomas Smith, Physical Scientist, AHB\n\nThe Review Team's findings are summarized in this memorandum and reflect the condition of the SWATH field unit's hydrographic systems on the review date. These findings have been divided into three categories of deficiencies:\n\nCATEGORY 1 \u00ad These deficiencies indicate the failure or absence of vital equipment or preparations of systems essential to acquisition and/or processing of hydrographic data. The vessel will be required to cease or limit hydrographic survey operations due to the following deficiencies:\n\n1. The hull of launch number 2901 has structurally cracked and the vessel has been removed from service until repairs are made. This vessel should not be used for hydrographic survey operations until the crack has been repaired.\n\n2. The ship's multibeam echosounder (MBES) was replaced during the current dockside repair period. A calibration (patch test) has not yet been conducted for this system due to ongoing ship repairs. The ship's MBES system can not be used to acquire data for NOAA hydrographic surveys until a successful system calibration has been performed.\n\n3. Side scan sonar (SSS) towfish S/N 8675309 failed to detect the 1 m3 test object nine out of ten times during calibration. No evidence of damage was noted on the towfish. After three unsuccessful attempts to complete the SSS calibration, EED was contacted and the towfish\n\nComment [J1]: This memo is to be submitted as a digitally signed PDF document.

Towfish repairs had not been completed at the time of this review.\n\nCATEGORY 2 \u00ad These deficiencies indicate noncompliance with established policies, directives, instructions, or accepted hydrographic practice not addressed under Category 1. The following deficiencies shall be corrected in as timely a manner as funding, time, and/or professional assistance permit:\n\n1. The field unit's Diver Least Depth Gauge (DLDG) is overdue for calibration. This system must be calibrated by the manufacturer annually.\n\n2. The side scan cable counter on Launch 2902 is broken, and the cable has been manually marked. These markings are deteriorating and no longer considered accurate. An accurate method of measuring cable out is required for side scan operations.\n\n3. To analyze a horizontal control reference station, a second portable DGPS reference station is needed for comparison. SWATH is not equipped to set up a second portable DGPS reference station due to loss of equipment during the 2004 field season.\n\n4. The field unit is currently performing GIS functions using MapInfo version 6.5. While this software version will perform locally without problems, OCS has upgraded to version 8.0. Project files and workspaces created using MapInfo version 8.0 may not be compatible with version 6.5.\n\nCATEGORY 3 \u00ad These deficiencies are associated with observations during the course of the review which merit consideration for corrective actions. These observations are included for review and dialogue related to potential problem areas and hydrographic operational efficiency. It is important to assure that resources (funds, skills, and time) are available at the operating level in order to meet the needs identified in this report and to sustain the efficient operation, upkeep, and repair of the field unit's hydrographic systems.\n\n1. Offset measurement and dynamic draft measurements for SWATH have not been completed for 2006. The ship intends to operate for the 2006 field season using historical values determined when the ship's Elac 1050D MBES was installed. Based in the inherent inaccuracy of the Elac system and the more relaxed requirements of IHO S-44 Order 2 surveying for which it is employed, the field unit considers historical offset and dynamic draft values to be adequate.\n\n2. Launch 2901 is equipped with a POS/MV version 3 system. The review team recommends that this system be upgraded to a version 4 system so that Precise Timing methods can be implemented with the launch's Reson 8125 MBES system.\n\nDATA STORAGE AVAILABILITY\n\nPlatform\n\nFree Space (TB)\n\nUsed Space (TB)\n\n2\n\n\f\fField Procedures Manual\nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Office of Coast Survey\n2014\nChapter 2 Appendices:\nDigital Data Directory Structure Field Unit File Structure (example) NAVMETOCCOMINST 3142A March 2007 \u00ad OCS Deviations NAVMETOCCOMINST 3142A March 2007 Basic Waterlevel Station Equipment Checklist Example of Fishing Gear Interaction Reimbursement Letter Example of Lobstermen's Association Letter Fishing Gear OGC Legal Opinion Memo Example LNM Survey Announcements\nPlease Note:\nThe Standard Operating Procedure's (SOP's) within the FPM Appendices are in the process of being transferred to the \"Documents\" section of the Hydroforum and the SOP's will reside in both places for the remainder of the 2014 field season.\n\n\f\fOffice of Coast Survey Authorized Deviations from NAVMETOCCOMINST 3142A, Mine Warfare Survey in Support of Maritime Homeland Defense, Technical Specifications, March 2007\nOffice of Coast Survey has worked with the Naval Oceanographic Office (NAVOCEANO) in developing the accompanying Technical Specification to ensure that OCS is capable of meeting the Navy's requirements for Homeland Security (HLS) survey work and that the data provided to the Navy is of maximum utility.

P.O. Box 421 Wakefield, RI 02903\nDear Mr. Dellinger,\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Ship Thomas Jefferson will be conducting hydrographic survey operations in Block Island Sound and Long Island Sound that will take place during May \u00ad November, 2013.\nA map showing the planned survey area(s) is included on the following page. These planned survey operations are subject to change due to weather and logistical constraints. It is the intent of the NOAA to coordinate with local regulatory authorities and lobstermen so survey operations can be conducted with minimal interference to lobster fishing.\nA hydrographic survey of this type requires that Thomas Jefferson tow a side scan sonar towfish approximately 20 to 60 feet off the bottom in some areas of this region. The towfish is approximately five feet in length, five inches in diameter, and towed by a cable. Side scan sonar and multibeam sonar systems will acquire detailed data of the bottom, delineating and obtaining least depths of potential hazards to navigation. Multibeam sonar data will be collected by two 29-foot aluminum survey launches. Please Note: These survey launches do not tow any sonar equipment. Their sonar equipment is rigidly mounted to the aluminum hulls.\nIt is understood that a high density of pots may be in the area during the survey operations. The personnel of Thomas Jefferson will exercise every caution while surveying to avoid entanglement of lobster pots. If a lobster pot does become entangled, Thomas Jefferson will immediately take action to stop the vessel and clear the pot lines from the sonar gear. In previous survey projects, coordination with local lobstermen allowed us to postpone certain areas of the survey knowing the lobster traps were to be moved at a later time frame. This coordination works out well for both survey operations and the lobstermen.\nIf you have any questions on the survey operations or general comments on how we may approach an effective coordination effort, please contact our Navigation Manager for the Northeast, LCDR Brent Pounds at (401) 782-3252 or via e-mail: Brent.Pounds@noaa.gov. Your cooperation is greatly appreciated.\nSincerely, Paul Turner, project planner for NOAA ship Thomas Jefferson (301) 713-2700 ext.106 Paul.Turner@noaa.gov\n\n\f\fTO: FROM:\nCC: DATE: RE:\n\nMEMORANDUM CAPT. Emily B. Christman Suzanne Bass, Attorney Advisor,\nGeneral Counsel Office for Ocean Service Jeffrey S. Dillen October 25, 2007 NOAA Employees' Immunity from State Prosecution\n\nQUESTION PRESENTED & BRIEF ANSWER\nYou have asked whether a State has the authority to stop and board a NOAA vessel and arrest a NOAA corps officer for alleged violations of a State law, where the vessel and its crew are engaged in operations authorized by Federal law.1 As described more fully below, we have determined that the State lacks such authority absent extraordinary circumstances. Our research was informed by discussions with attorneys from the Department of Commerce and other agencies, including the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Coast Guard, and the U.S. Attorney's Office in Boston.\nDISCUSSION\nUnder normal circumstances, a State cannot seize or board a Federal vessel. Vessels or cargo of the United States are exempt from civil seizure pursuant to the Suits In Admiralty Act, 46 U.S.C. 30908. In addition, a State may not detain and/or prosecute a NOAA officer \u00ad or indeed any Federal employee \u00ad serving on a NOAA vessel when they are engaged in the performance of their duty. Such action is barred by the so-called \"Supremacy Clause\" of the U.S. Constitution:\n1 This question arose out of a situation near Cape Cod Bay, Massachusetts, where the NOAA Ship Thomas Jefferson is performing a survey mission. After local lobstermen complained of lost gear \u00ad allegedly damaged by the Thomas Jefferson \u00ad the NOAA Office of General Counsel was contacted by counsel for the Massachusetts Department of Marine Fisheries, who stated that the complaints, if proven, showed a violation of Massachusetts law. See Mass. Ann Laws, Ch. 130, 31 (2007) (\"Whoever without the consent of the owner . . . destroys, injures or molests any . . . lobster or crab pot or other fishing gear . . , shall be punished by a fine of not less than five hundred nor more than one thousand dollars or by imprisonment for two months, or both..\"). After lobstermen threatened to request the Massachusetts Environmental Police seize the Thomas Jefferson and arrest its Commanding Officer, our office was contacted to determine whether the State, in fact, had authority to take such action. This situation is used as a case study in the following analysis.\n\n\fThis Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of the State to the Contrary notwithstanding.\nU.S. Const. Art. VI, Cl. 2.\nThus a State may not enforce laws impeding Federal law, and in many circumstances, Federal officials are immune from State prosecution when carrying out Federal laws. As the Supreme Court stated over a century ago:\n...if the prisoner is held in the state court to answer for an act which he was authorized to do by the law of the United States, which it was his duty to do as marshal of the United States, and if in so doing that act he did not more than what was necessary and proper for him to do, he cannot be guilty of a crime under the law of the State of California. When these things are shown, it is established that he is innocent of any crime against the laws of the State, or of any other authority whatever.\nIn re Neagle, 135 U.S. 1, 75 (1890).2\nThis immunity applies, under the circumstances described in Neagle, despite the lack of an explicit grant of immunity in the Federal law under which the Federal employee acts. \"It is not necessary for Congress to provide expressly for such immunity in the statutes under which federal officials act; Supremacy Clause immunity is 'incidental to, and is implied in the several acts by which these [federal] institutions are created, and is secured to the individuals employed in them, by the judicial power alone.'\" Wyoming v. Livingston, 443 F.3d 1211, 1217 (10th Cir. 2006), quoting Osborn v. Bank of United States, 22 U.S. 738, 865-866 (1824).\nNeagle thus provides a two-part test for Federal employee immunity under the Supremacy Clause:\n1. Is the Federal employee acting within his authority under Federal law? and\n2.) Did the employee do no more than what was necessary and proper for him to do in fulfilling his duty?\nThe first part of the Neagle test is relatively straightforward: Did the Federal employee's alleged violation of State law take place while he was performing an action which he was authorized to do under Federal law? Many cases examining this question deal with\n2 Neagle was a Federal marshal who was charged by the State of California for killing the attacker of a Federal judge whom Neagle was protecting pursuant to orders from his superiors. Neagle was discharged from State custody by a Federal writ of habeas corpus.\n2\n\n\fFederal law enforcement officials charged with (and held to have immunity from) State crimes such as murder3 and bribery.4 In one notable case, the Supreme Court affirmed the immunity of a Federal administrator of a disabled Civil War soldiers' facility charged under State law with the offense of serving oleomargarine without posting notice of the fact. The Court noted that while the grounds of the facility were within State jurisdiction, the Federal administrator of the soldiers' home served food to the residents under the authority of federal provisioning statutes, and therefore was able to provide the oleomargarine without notice, notwithstanding State law. Ohio v. Thomas, 173 U.S. 276, 285 (1899). More recently, Federal Fish and Wildlife employees were found to be immune from state prosecution for trespassing on private land (in violation of state statutes) during the federal employees' activities in tagging wild wolves pursuant to a federal statute for reintroduction of the wolves in the West. Livingston, supra at 1222.\nWith respect the Cape Cod Bay situation, the Thomas Jefferson is conducting surveys pursuant to Federal authority provided in the Coast and Geodetic Survey Act, 33 U.S.C. 883a et seq. This statute provides the Secretary of Commerce \u00ad and those to whom he delegates his authority \u00ad with the authority to conduct surveys for navigational, scientific and other purposes. See 33 U.S.C. 883a. Moreover, \"[t]he President is authorized to cause to be employed such of the public vessels as he deems it expedient to employ, and to give such instructions for regulating their conduct as he deems proper in order to carry out the provisions of this Act [33 USCS \u00a7\u00a7 883a-883i],\" see 33 U.S.C. 883h. The Hydrographic Services Improvement Act further confirms this authority in mandatory language, stating \"the Administrator [of NOAA] shall...acquire and disseminate hydrographic data.\" See 33 U.S.C. 892a(a)(1). The NOAA Ship Thomas Jefferson, pursuant to this authority, is conducting the Cape Cod Bay Right Whale Route survey in accordance with Hydrographic Survey Project Instructions -- project number M-A902TJ/GM-07. This satisfies the first element of the Neagle test.\nThe second element of the Neagle test is more nuanced: Was the Federal employee doing no more than what was necessary and proper for him to do in fulfilling his duty, when the alleged State law violation took place? In finding what is \"necessary and proper,\" courts look at the specific circumstances surrounding the Federal employee's behavior in carrying out his Federally authorized duty. This examination is fact-specific and courts have shied away from a one-size-fits-all definition of what \"necessary and proper\" behavior is. Rather, courts have adopted a \"reasonableness\" standard to gauge what activities are necessary and proper: \"The substance of the standards applied ... is that of honest and reasonable belief. If ... [the Federal employee] shows without dispute that he had no motive other than to discharge his duty under the circumstances as they appeared to him and that he had an honest and reasonable belief that what he did was necessary in the performance of his duty ...then he is entitled to the relief he seeks. This\n3 See Neagle, supra.\n4 See, e.g., Baucom v. Martin, 677 F.2d 1346 (11th Cir. 1982).\n3\n\n\fis so even though his belief was mistaken or his judgment poor.\" Petition of McShane, 235 F. Supp. 262, 274 (D. Miss. 1964).5\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit cited McShane repeatedly in 1977, in the case of a Federal agent who shot and killed a man fleeing an arrest scene. In finding the agent immune from State prosecution, the Court opined that what constitutes necessary and proper \"must rest not only on the subjective belief of the officer but also on the objective finding that his conduct may be said to be reasonable under the existing circumstances.\" Clifton v. Cox, 549 F.2d 722, 728 (9th Cir. 1977); accord Baucom, supra at 1351 (finding a Federal agent immune from State prosecution for bribery instigated pursuant to an undercover \"sting\" operation, and stressing reasonableness under the existing circumstances).\nIn light of this precedent, we believe that a NOAA vessel performing a survey using normal operating procedures is engaged in \"necessary and proper\" conduct. Consequently, in the Cape Cod Bay situation, the Thomas Jefferson satisfies the Neagle test while performing its Federally authorized surveying duties, and is immune from State prosecution. The efforts by NOAA's Office of Marine and Aviation Operations (OMAO) to work with local lobstermen to develop a surveying protocol that would alleviate or minimize concerns of gear loss, and its ongoing activities implementing that protocol, further demonstrates the reasonableness of OMAO's actions. Collectively, these actions militate against any finding that the Thomas Jefferson and its crew are engaging in conduct outside of what is \"necessary and proper.\"\nCONCLUSION\nA State may not detain or prosecute a Federal vessel's captain and crew for alleged violations of State law which occurred pursuant to the captain/crew's conduct of their duty under Federal law, so long as these Federal employees did no more than was necessary in fulfilling their duty under Federal law. As applied to the current case, OMAO employees aboard the Thomas Jefferson should be immune from seizure and prosecution for alleged violations of State law while conducting the Federally authorized survey of the Cape Cod Bay area.\n5 In McShane, a Federal marshal was charged under State law with ordering the use of tear gas on a crowd \u00ad an action the marshal felt was justified due to the perceived imminence of a riot.\n4\n\n\fNY/NJ \u00ad APPROACHES TO PORT OF NEW YORK AND NEW JERSEY - NOAA Hydrographic Survey Operations NOAA Ship Thomas Jefferson (S222) will be conducting hydrographic survey operations throughout the area south of Long Beach and Hempstead Bay from approximately 20 March 2013 through 31 May 2013.

The following are used in conjunction with the operation and care of the instrument: battery charger, underwater plug, special processing software, Sea-Bird Electronics SEACAT CTD Profiler, and barograph. Neither the profiler nor the barograph is provided with the instrument; rather they must be resident on the ship.\nPHYSICAL FEATURES Figure 1 is a picture of the front of the enclosure of the MOD III DLDG. The face plate on the enclosure is clear to allow the LED display to be read (in this case, 14.51 psia).\nFigure 1\nFigure 2 also shows the front of a MOD III DLDG. Shown to its left is an InSitu MiniTroll instrument, a handheld absolute pressure gauge.\n\n\fFigure 2\nThe rear face of the MOD III enclosure contains the bulkhead electrical connector and the pressure port. There is a 7 cm vertical offset distance between the position of the pressure port and the bottom of the instrument case. Note that this offset is applied as a correction by program VELOCWIN in the computation of the least depth. Therefore, in order to obtain a correct value for the least depth, the MOD III gauge should be placed on top of the diver-determined least depth point and held level so that the LED readout is upright (as shown in Figures 1 and 2). THE GAUGE IS TO BE CONNECTED TO THE BATTERY CHARGER WHEN NOT BEING USED ON A DIVE OPERATION. This is to increase the reliability and availability of the unit. A fully charged battery should give the gauge approximately 10 hours operating time. For the instrument to be returned from low voltage to its fully operational condition, the battery must be on charge for 18 hours. For the InSitu MiniTroll, the pressure port is 2.9 cm from the bottom tip of the probe. The bottom tip is the end opposite the watertight screw cap covering the data port. The 2.9 cm offset is applied as a correction by program VELOCWIN in the computation of\n\n\fthe least depth. Therefore, for accurate results, the MiniTroll should be held upright with the bottom tip of the wand placed on the user-determined least depth point.\nSOFTWARE\nThe Diver submenu of program VELOCWIN provides two options to use in conjunction with the Diver Least Depth Gauge:\n(1) Least Depth Report (2) Daily DQA \u00ad Diver Gauge.\nThe Least Depth Report option prompts the user for several inputs including the pressure on-deck and at the user-determined least depth point. Using these two values, the calibration data for the DLDG, and the data from a Sea-Bird SEACAT CTD cast taken in the vicinity, VELOCWIN computes the least depth of the submerged object. The results of this option are shown in Figure 3 which may be printed out to obtain a hard copy record of the dive and the least depth result.\nFigure 3\n\n\fThe Daily DQA option is a data quality assurance procedure for the DLDG. It prompts the user for the on-deck DLDG pressure in psia and the barograph reading in mbars. Using these values and the gauge's calibration data, VELOCWIN determines if the instrument is operating within acceptable bounds. The results are a running log file (DIVERDAILYDQA.DAT) and a graphical display of the relationship between the ship's barograph and the DLDG. Figure 4 is an example of the graphical display.\nFigure 4\nThe calibration file for the gauge has filename, SN.CAL, where SN is the serial number of the gauge (example: 68332.CAL). The default location for this file is C:\\VELOCITY, the directory of program VELOCWIN. If it is stored elsewhere, VELOCWIN will prompt the user for the location. DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE The DAILY DQA option requires that the on-deck DLDG pressure be entered in psia to two decimal places and the barograph reading be entered to the nearest millibar.\n\n\fThe LED readout is absolute pressure in units of pounds per square inch. This on-deck reading should be in the region of 14.70 psia. The reading will rise and fall with the local atmospheric pressure, along with variations in the distance below the water surface. The nominal depth equivalent of a 0.01 psia change in pressure is 0.5 cm. If the gauge is subjected to horizontal acceleration in a line between the pressure port and the LED readout, there may be a small change in the pressure reading.\nThe DAILYDQA option should be run each day. It should also be run before and after each day's dive operation to provide a pre- and post-dive record. At the end of each field season and any other time that the gauge is returned to a Marine Center, the running log file, \"\\VELOCITY\\DIVERDAILYDQA.DAT\", must be returned with the gauge.\nThe gauge uses a built-in, approximate calibration curve to derive the pressure values shown on the LED readout. The more accurate calibration curve, by gauge serial number, is employed by the VELOCWIN program to achieve high accuracy results. The data quality assurance test might not indicate an exact one-to-one relationship with the ship's barograph, but the relationship should be reasonable and regular and fall within the acceptance bounds shown in the DAILY DQA graphical display.\nDIVE OPERATION\nAs shown in Figures 1 and 2, the handle is attached to the gauge such that the unit must be held in the diver's right hand in order for the numerals in the LED readout to be upright. The unit should be placed on top of the diver-determined least depth point and held close to level. Below the water's surface, a depth error, in centimeters, of approximately 15*SIN(tilt angle) will result from non-level operation. When the unit is at depth and fixed on the least depth point, the pressure readout will vary as a result of any overhead surface waves. The peak to peak variation due to these waves may occur over a period from 1 to 8 seconds. Therefore, it is necessary for the diver to observe the LED readout for 10 seconds or more to improve the diver's estimate of the mean pressure.\nOn days when dive operations are to be conducted, the gauge will be disconnected from the battery charger. The exposed electrical connector on the instrument must be capped with the underwater connector which is provided. It is not necessary to disconnect the battery charger from the ship's A/C supply. There are three pins on the electrical connector, one of which is larger than the others. The underwater plug has a flat spot over the large pin. Care should be taken when inserting the charger cable plug or the underwater blanking plug onto the instrument to be sure that the connector is correctly orientated relative to the pins of the electrical connector on the rear of the enclosure.\nPrevious to each dive, the pressure reading on the instrument must be observed with the unit out of the water and appropriately recorded. A diver will carry the unit on the dive to locate and measure the least depth on a designated object. The accurate least depth is determined via head pressure at the diver-designated least depth point, in conjunction\n\n\fwith the knowledge of the local vertical density profile. The head pressure is the difference between the on-deck (pre-dive) pressure reading and the pressure observed by the diver at depth. The density of the water column is obtained from the Sea-Bird SEACAT CTD cast taken in the vicinity. Running the Least Depth Report option of VELOCWIN computes the head pressure and converts it to the reported least depth.\nUpon completion of a day's dive operations, the Diver Least Depth Gauge must be washed with fresh water and wiped dry. The underwater plug must be removed from the rear of the gauge and stored in a safe place. Finally, the battery charger should be connected to the gauge being careful of the connector orientation.\nSUPPORTING DATA\nThe local density profile must be independently measured in the vicinity of the dive site with a SEABIRD SBE-19 or SBE-19Plus SEACAT Profiler and processed via the VELOCWIN program. The cast should be taken in accordance with the specific SEACAT instructions, which are documented separately. However, IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT THE SEACAT SHOULD BE POWERED-ON AND HELD ON-DECK FOR AT LEAST THREE MINUTES PREVIOUS TO LOWERING THE SEACAT INTO THE WATER.\nComplete instructions for taking a SEACAT cast are available from the VELOCWIN Help submenu under Precast Setup\nCALIBRATION\nEach Diver Least Depth Gauge will require an annual calibration before deployment for the field season. At the end of the field season, a post-deployment verification must also be performed. Post-deployment verification and pre-deployment calibration may be performed simultaneously. The gauge must be returned to the Marine Center for forwarding to the manufacturer for calibration. Once calibration is accomplished, a hardcopy calibration report will be provided for each gauge. A copy of the report must be provided to HSTP/CSDL in order for an extended calibration curve to be generated (to accommodate deep dives). HSTP provides the extended calibration curve as a digital file named SN.CAL where SN is the DLDG serial number. The file is disseminated to all field units.\nCALIBRATION GUIDELINES\nThe gauge contains a 100 psia pressure transducer. Calibration between approximately 13 and 50 psia is critical for accurate least depth measurements. A data set of fourteen points, with the first point being below ambient pressure, the next point at ambient pressure, the next seven points at 1 psia increments above ambient pressure, and the remaining points at 5 psia increments will insure sufficient accuracy. Replacing\n\n\fexhausted batteries will not effect calibration; however, any circuit repairs will require complete gauge calibration.\nCalibration is performed by: PTC Electronics Inc. 45 Whitney Road, Suite B9 Mahwah, NJ 07430 Attn: John C. Kicks\nPROBLEMS\nIf the results of the DAILYDQA test fall outside the acceptance bounds, this fact should be noted to the Marine Center and arrangements made for the gauge to be replaced and/or repaired. In addition, inform the Marine Center if any other irregular performance of the DLDG arouses suspicion.\n\n\fHORCON/VERCON OBSERVATION LOG\n\nDATE:\n\nSESSION:\n\nPROJECT NAME:\n\nWX CONDITIONS:\n\nSITE NAME: ___________________ SITE PHOTO(S): Y / N\n\nOBSERVER(S):\n\nSITE TYPE: HORZ. / VERT. / ATON / BM / NEW / ________________\n\nDN:\n\nRECEIVER #: _____________________ FIXED HEIGHT?

Depending on the survey vessel equipment, there may be additional configuration steps. There are two sets of device setups that need to be configured when using the Hypack software suite. The first setup is in Hypack Hardware, which includes devices that provide navigation, motion, heading, singlebeam bathymetry and AIS information. The second setup is in Hysweep Hardware which includes navigation, motion, backscatter imagery and multibeam bathymetry (See Diagram 1). It is also important to setup the Ethernet Realtime output section in the POSView software to be compatible with this setup.\n1. POS M/V Setup * Items in this controller should only be changed by experienced users with the unit. If you are new to POS you should only verify that the items addressed below are correct and then you may start logging. ** Reminder: If you want to change anything in the logging control windows you must be connected first.\n1.1 Ethernet Realtime Output\nThe following message groups should be selected for Ethernet Realtime output in the POS M/M POSView software: 3, 7, 10, 20 and 102. These are the only messages that Hypack/Hysweep will read from the POS Ethernet feed. Any other messages can be turned on, but will be ignored by Hypack/Hysweep.\n2. Hypack Survey Setup\n2.1 Starting a new Project\n In the main map viewer window: Select File > Project Manager  Select New Project \u00ad Name accordingly based on accepted naming convention.\nAll data will be stored in this project directory unless changed by the surveyor. NOTE: Hypack will use the device configuration of the last loaded project.\n2.2 Setting the Geodetic Parameters\n\u00b7 When creating a new project, it is very important to set the correct geodetic parameters, including the UTZ zone and the ellipsoid for the survey area. \u00b7 Click on the \"world\" icon in the main toolbar to access the geodetic parameters. \u00b7 Select the appropriate grid (UTM North) and zone for the survey area \u00b7 Choose the GRS-1980 ellipsoid. This is the proper ellipsoid for the NAD-83 datum. See Image 2. \u00b7 Also confirm that the distance and depth units are set to meters.\n\nImage 1- Toolbar\n\n\fNOAA FIELD UNITS HYPACK / HYSWEEP DEVICE SETUP SOP\n\n2\n\nHYPACK 2013 \u00ad Updated April 2013\n\nImage 2 \u00ad Geodetic Parameters\n2.3 Hypack Hardware (Device) Configuration Any sensor that needs to be recorded in Hypack must to be added in the Hypack Hardware window.

This action will synch the PC clock to GPS time coming from the POS M/V or other GPS device. If any device is integrated in Hypack that is not timed externally, device messages will be stamped upon arrival in the Hypack program.\n Normally the POS M/V device is used for clock synchronization. See Image 8.\n\nImage 8 \u00ad Setting Clock Synch\n2.5 Boat Configuration  Check that the correct device (source) shows up next to each information type. This should be correct by default.  It is on this screen that you can change the tracking point of the boat. This will add an offset to the navigational reference point so that the vessel's transducer can be steered over the survey line. This is important for real time coverage mapping on vessels with a significant X-axis distance between the RP and the transducer. See Image 9. (This offset is for display only)\n\nImage 9 \u00ad Boat Configuration\n\n\fNOAA FIELD UNITS HYPACK / HYSWEEP DEVICE SETUP SOP\n\n7\n\nHYPACK 2013 \u00ad Updated April 2013\n\n2.6 Device Testing\n Testing of devices should be conducted periodically to make sure all sensors are communicating properly. Device testing is also commonly used as a troubleshooting tool when communication errors arise. Devices should be tested individually and together to determine any possible conflicts with other sensors.\n The most important device to check in Hypack Hardware is the Applanix POS M/V. Since this sensor provides navigation. Attitude and timing information, it is essential that Hypack is receiving all data properly.\n\n2.6.1 Click on the Test button in the POS M/V device to access the hardware test screen.\na. Ensure that all of the categories are populated, changing and seem to be correct. See image 10 below.\n\nImage 10 \u00ad POS M/V device testing b.

The NOAA mission is to understand and predict changes in the Earth's environment and conserve and manage coastal and marine resources to meet our Nation's economic, social, and environmental needs. NOAA's vision in supporting this mission is that of an informed society that uses a comprehensive understanding of the role of the oceans, coasts, and atmosphere in the global ecosystem to make the best social and economic decisions.\nThe Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (CO-OPS) of the National Ocean Service (NOS) is an organizational element of NOAA. We operate and maintain a network of 210 long-term water level measurement stations as part of the National Water Level Observation Network (NWLON) around the coastal United States and the Great Lakes. The NWLON supports the following four NOAA Mission Goals:\n\u00b7 Healthy Oceans \u00b7 Climate Adaptation and Mitigation \u00b7 Weather Ready Nation \u00b7 Resilient Coastal Communities and Economies\nCO-OPS also installs and operates short-term water level stations in support of programs such as:\n\u00b7 Hydrographic and Photogrammetric Surveys \u00b7 Marine Boundary Determinations \u00b7 Treaty Regulation \u00b7 Harbor Dredging \u00b7 Climate Change \u00b7 Long-Term Sea Level Rise \u00b7 Habitat Restoration \u00b7 Real Time Navigation \u00b7 NOS VDatum Program\nThe data collected and the products derived from these water level stations are used to:\n Ensure safe, efficient, and environmentally sound maritime commerce.  Provide data and products required by the National Weather Service to meet storm surge\nflood and tsunami warning responsibilities.  Enhance navigation through a national network of Physical Oceanographic Real-Time\nSystems (PORTS\u00ae) in major U.S. harbors.\nPORTS\u00ae is a partnering effort based on the collaboration between NOS and local maritime communities to identify and satisfy user needs for improving the safety and efficiency of maritime commerce and coastal resource management through the integration of real-time environmental observations, forecasts, and other geospatial information. PORTS\u00ae comes in\n\nStanding Project Instructions for Coastal and Great Lakes Water Level Stations, Updated August 2011\n\nPage 1\n\n\fdifferent sizes and configurations, each designed to meet local user requirements. PORTS\u00ae\nincludes sensors, hardware, and associated communications systems which allow the centralized,\nreal-time data acquisition and dissemination of water levels, currents, and other oceanographic and meteorological data. The modular design of each PORTS\u00ae installation allows the straight\nforward integration of additional sensors to meet user requirements.\n\nIn carrying out our mission, CO-OPS performs the following:\n\n Establishes the standards for the acquisition and processing of water level and current data.\n Collects and documents user requirements that serve as the foundation for all resulting program activities.\n Designs new and improved oceanographic observing systems; develops software to improve data processing capabilities.\n Maintains and operates oceanographic observing systems; performs operational data analysis and quality control.\n Produces and disseminates oceanographic products.  Archives the resulting oceanographic data.\n\nThese Standing Project Instructions provide the recurring requirements for installation,\noperation, maintenance, and removal of water level stations in support of the NWLON, PORTS\u00ae, Coastal Oceanographic Applications and Services of Tides and Lakes (COASTAL)\nProgram, hydrographic and photogrammetric survey operations, NOS VDatum and reimbursable\nspecial projects. These stations provide critical data to support the following activities:\n\n Ensure safe navigation  Determine flow rates to support International treaties  Determine tidal datums for the National Nautical Charting Program and the National\nShoreline Mapping Program  Determine the baseline from which marine boundaries are delineated  National Weather Service tsunami and storm surge warning programs  Coastal resource restoration and management  Long term sea level trend analyses.\n\nThe objective of these Standing Project Instructions is to ensure that all the deployed systems and sensors are maintained in an effective and consistent manner for collecting continuous, reliable, and defect-free data.\n\n1.1 General Data and Reference Datum Requirements\n\nThe NOAA Nautical Chart Reference Datum for tidal waters is Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW) based on the latest NOAA National Tidal Datum Epoch (NTDE) of 1983-2001. The NOAA shoreline reference datums are MLLW and Mean High Water (MHW). See http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/publications/glossary2.pdf for descriptions of all tidal datums. All tidal datum computations and water level reductions for shoreline surveys shall be referenced\n\nStanding Project Instructions for Coastal and Great Lakes Water Level Stations, Updated August 2011\n\nPage 2\n\n\fto these datums.\nIn cases where historical sites are re-occupied, every effort shall be made to collect the new data series on the historical Station Datum (SD). In that case, data can be acquired relative to MLLW for immediate application during the survey. If the historical datum cannot be recovered, an arbitrary SD shall be assigned to the Primary Bench Mark (PBM) and the MLLW datum calculated after 30 to 60 days of water level data are collected.\nIn non-tidal areas, including the Great Lakes, special low water datums have been defined and are used as chart datum in these locations. For the Great Lakes, a unique Low Water Datum (LWD) for each lake based on the International Great Lakes Datum of 1985 (IGLD 85) is the reference datum. In other non-tidal coastal areas, LWD is determined by subtracting 0.5 ft from the Mean Water Level (MWL), as calculated from the water level data collected in these locations.\nLeveling and GPS connections to geodetic datums are made at each water level station, as described in Section 3.6 Geodetic connections.\n1.2 Reference Documents\nThe following reference documents are referred in various sections of the Standing Project Instructions.\n(1) \"NGWLMS Site Design, Preparation, and Installation Manual (NGWLMS Manual), January 1991\".\n(2) \"Xpert DCP User's Manual, October 2006\".

The installer could be CO-OPS personnel, NOAA ship personnel, Office of Coast Survey (OCS) Navigational Response Teams (NRT), other NOAA personnel, or contractors.\n2.1 Reconnaissance\nThe reconnaissance of water level and meteorological stations shall be performed in accordance with Reference 13.\n2.2 Water Level Sensor Specifications\nThe following sections provide the sensors and specifications that are used at CO-OPS water level stations.\n2.2.1 Primary Water Level Sensor\nThe primary sensor used at a CO-OPS water level station is one of the following:\n AquatrakTM self-calibrating air acoustic sensor  Paroscientific pressure sensors tied into a single or dual orifice gas purged bubbler\nsystem  BEI Motion Systems absolute shaft angle encoder (SAE)  Design Analysis Waterlog microwave in a limited capacity\nCurrently, the AquatrakTM sensor is used at the majority of tidal water level stations as the primary water level sensor. At stations where the acoustic sensor cannot be used due to the freezing of the water's surface or the lack of a suitable support structure, a single or dual Paroscientific intelligent pressure sensor(s) is incorporated into a gas purged bubbler system. In the Great Lakes, a sump with a float driven absolute shaft angle encoder is used. A microwave air gap sensor is used in selected PORTS\u00ae projects. Starting this year, a microwave sensor will be used in a limited capacity at low wave energy locations.\nThe sensor type will be determined after the reconnaissance of the site is completed, the final station design is performed, and CO-OPS has approved the site and the type of sensors. COOPS' approval of the type of water level sensor is mandatory for a project.\n\nStanding Project Instructions for Coastal and Great Lakes Water Level Stations, Updated August 2011\n\nPage 5\n\n\fThe sensor measurement range shall be greater than the expected range of water level and the installation shall be designed to measure the full range of extreme water level such as highest observed and lowest observed water level data (100 years, if available). The highest observed may have an additional wave allowance value added as determined by ED.\nSensors are calibrated prior to deployment, and the calibration is checked following removal. The calibration standard's accuracy is traceable to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).\nFor NWLON water level data, the water level sensor resolution is 1 mm or better. For hydrographic and photogrammetry surveys the required water level sensor resolution is a function of the tidal range of the area in which water level data is collected: when the tidal range is less than or equal to 5 m, the required water level sensor resolution is 1 mm or better; when the tidal range is between 5 m and 10 m, the required water level sensor resolution is 3 mm or better; and when the tidal range is greater than 10 m, the required water level sensor resolution is 5 mm or better.\nKnown error sources for each sensor are handled appropriately through ancillary measurements and/or correction algorithms. Examples of such errors are water density variations for pressure gauges, sound path air temperature differences for acoustic systems, and high frequency wave action and high velocity currents for all sensor types. At a number of NWLON stations, dual orifice gas purged orifices which are mounted a fixed vertical distance apart and connected to two vented Paroscientific pressure transducers are used so that a density correction can be estimated for each sample based on the pressure difference and gravity.\nThe orientation of the primary sensor shall be carefully documented in elevation (side) view sketches and photographs, as required. Orientation of the protective well (or sump and intake in the Great Lakes) relative to the wave or current modifiers such as nearby pilings, bulkheads, or other structures in the water shall be photographed and documented. All features in the vicinity of the protective well such as, pilings, other wells, decking, buildings (tide house), etc., which might cause uneven sun/shading of the well and resulting non-uniformity of temperature inside the well shall also be well photographed and documented.\nThe installer shall have all forms and figures submitted using metric units and referenced to the SD as applicable. Other references (e.g. orifice zero or tide staff zero) shall also be shown on the forms with reference to the SD.\n2.2.2 Redundant Water Level Sensor\nThe redundant sensor used at a CO-OPS water level station is one of the following:\n IMO, Druck, or KPSI pressure sensor tied into a single gas purged bubbler system  Waterlog relative shaft angle encoder (SAE)\n\nStanding Project Instructions for Coastal and Great Lakes Water Level Stations, Updated August 2011\n\nPage 6\n\n\fAt tidal water level stations, the redundant water level bubbler orifices shall be secured structurally independent of the primary water level sensors (i.e. on a separate piling, etc). At Great Lakes stations, the Waterlog shaft angle encoder (SAE) shall be set to read the same as the Electric Tape Gauge (ETG) and the primary SAE.\nThe cable lengths of all water level and ancillary sensors shall be noted in the E-Site Report, or Xpert Site Report, or Tide Station Report to the nearest tenth of a meter (rounded up to the nearest meter value). This will assist with the efficient replacement of cables should a failure occur.\n2.2.3 Tsunami Data Requirements\nNWLON and other water level stations installed and supporting the NOAA Tsunami Program shall have 1 minute averaged water level data available in addition to the 6 minute data. The 1 minute averaged data will be mainly coming from the primary sensor during the normal operations. In addition, 15 second data from the redundant sensor shall also be made available in the event of a tsunami, or as per the request of National Weather Service (NWS) Tsunami Warning Centers, and the Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory of NOAA's Office of Atmospheric Research (OAR).\nThe RAM pack and other storage devices may be appropriate for storing the 15 second data. The sizes of the data files (minimum number of days data) for 6-minute water level data (ssp.log), 1 minute tsunami data (tsu1min.log), and system log data shall be collected according to Engineering Bulletin 09-003 dated November 13, 2009. This Bulletin is available on the ROS Wiki Page and can be made available for contractors on request, if applicable.\n2.3 Data Collection Platform\nThe primary Data Collection Platform (DCP) shall acquire and store water level measurements every 6 minutes. The water level measurements shall consist of an average of three minutes of discrete water level samples with the period of the average centered about the six minute mark (i.e. :00, :06, :12, etc.). In addition to the average measurement, the standard deviation of the discrete water level samples and outliers which comprise the 6-minute measurements shall be computed and stored. The 6-minute centered average water level data and the standard deviation provide valuable data quality information regarding each measurement.\nFor NWLON stations, a redundant DCP shall also be installed so that in case of a failure of a primary DCP or sensor, water level data from the redundant DCP or sensor can be retrieved. The redundant DCP also shall acquire and store water level measurements every 6- minutes and the water level measurements shall consist of an average of three minutes of discrete water level samples with the period of the average centered about the six minute mark (i.e. :00, :06, :12, etc.).\nThe primary and redundant DCP, where applicable, shall have a capacity to store at least 30 days of 6 minute water level data and meteorological sensor data, if applicable.\n\nStanding Project Instructions for Coastal and Great Lakes Water Level Stations, Updated August 2011\n\nPage 7\n\n\f2.4 GOES Satellite Transmissions\n\nThe ability to monitor water level measurement system performance for near real-time quality assurance is essential for operations. Water level data transmitted via satellite in NOS format is retrieved and monitored by CO-OPS, and in the case of data gaps, sensor, or gauge problems, corrective actions are taken immediately. At all sites where access to the GOES satellite is available, and according to CO-OPS policy, the measurement system shall be equipped with a GOES transmitter to telemeter the data to NOS. This section is applicable where water level gauges are installed by CO-OPS or CO-OPS' contractors for NWLON, Tsunami, COASTAL, VDatum, Special projects, and NOAA in-house survey projects. This section is not applicable for NOAA contract hydrographic or photogrammetric projects.\n\nThe data transmissions shall use the message format detailed in Reference 16. This format is currently implemented in the Next Generation Water Level Measurement Systems (NGWLMS), assuring compatibility with the CO-OPS Data Management System (DMS).\n\nThe NOS Continuous Operational Real-Time Monitoring System (CORMS) is a 24 x 7 data monitoring operation. It monitors all water level measurement system data transmitted via GOES to assure the gauges are operating properly. Data that is not transmitted by GOES but is submitted to CO-OPS via diskette, CD-ROM, or such other electronic media, must also conform to the format specified in the above document so that data can be loaded properly into DMS.\n\nThe clock accuracy of a satellite radio system shall be adjusted with a GPS clock for NWLON gauges. For a tide gauge that does not have a GPS clock, or that transmits hourly or three hourly, the clock accuracy of a satellite radio system shall be within 5 seconds per month for short term water level gauges so that adjacent satellite channel overlapping does not occur. Non-satellite radio systems shall have a clock accuracy of better than one minute per month.\n\n2.5 Data Transmission Initiation and Station Database Configuration Requirements\n\nThe CO-OPS' Engineering Division (ED) Operational Engineering Team (OET) maintains the GOES platform ID list for all water level stations in the NWLON. For new NWLON stations, once the location, type of sensors, and DCP are selected, OET assigns the platform ID and provides the satellite configuration data for the deployment.\n\nFor other types of water level stations, such as subordinate stations installed for NOAA in-house hydrographic or photogrammetric surveys, or meteorological (met) only stations, OET also assigns platform IDs, as appropriate. This section pertains to water level stations installed by NOAA ships, CO-OPS, or CO-OPS IDIQ contractors. This section is not applicable for contract hydrographic and photogrammetry stations installed by OCS and NGS survey contractors.\n\nOET will provide station numbers and platform ID assignments for equipment setup and testing when the location, which consists of a local name, body of water, and latitude and longitude, of the station is reported to OET. OET can be reached by telephone at 301-713-2897, fax: 301-713-\n\nStanding Project Instructions for Coastal and Great Lakes Water Level Stations, Updated August 2011\n\nPage 8\n\n\f4465 or 301-713-4435, or e-mail address at nos.coops.oetteam@noaa.gov. Requests for GOES platform IDs shall be submitted to OET at least 15 days before throughput testing to allow sufficient time to receive radio frequency assignments. Refer to Reference 32 for procedures on requesting a platform ID.\n\nCritical Information required for water level station database configuration at CO-OPS Database Management System (DMS):\n(1) Station Number and Name (2) Installation Date (3) Latitude/longitude (4) Platform ID, transmit time, channel (5) Serial numbers of all DCPs, and sensors. (6) Level abstract (7) Sensor offset C1 (SNS) and Datum Offset C2 (DAT) as entered in the DCP for acoustic sensor; and orifice offset(s) for pressure sensors.\n\nPrior to the installation of a station and initiation of GOES data transmissions from the field, critical information that is needed for database configuration shall be emailed or faxed to OET. See the figure at left for the critical information required for station database configuration in the CO-OPS DMS. Test transmissions monitored by the installer during the field unit installation may be conducted outside this requirement.\n\nThis station information must be configured in DMS for data to be accepted in DMS. Whenever possible, within 24 hours after reporting the above basic information and before the complete inspection package is submitted, the draft E-Site Report (or Xpert Site Report or Tide Station Report) shall be forwarded to OET. This is called the one-day draft E-Site Report submission requirement and its purpose is to:\n1) Standardize the requirements for all of CO-OPS' field efforts; 2) Provide feedback by OET to the Installer while at the site, so that critical information is\nverified; and 3) Insure that timely corrective actions and required maintenance actions as described in the\nstation specific Project Instructions can be accomplished by the Installer while at the site.\nGenerally, OET will respond back to the Installer or provide feedback within 24 hours or earlier during normal business hours during the work week. This requirement applies to all types of water level stations and all types of sensors for every type of maintenance - installation, regular scheduled maintenance, emergency maintenance and removal of a water level station, where COOPS is expected to receive and/or process the data.\n\nStanding Project Instructions for Coastal and Great Lakes Water Level Stations, Updated August 2011\n\nPage 9\n\n\fCO-OPS has developed a web-based electronic site report (E-Site Report) that interacts with DMS. Refer to Reference 27 and 28 for the User's Guide and the SOP for using the E-Site report.\nThe effective starting date of all operational sensor data series is the date and time when the data is first received after the DMS configuration. It is the responsibility of the installer to ensure that the required documentation is provided to OET prior to the date when the operational sensor data are needed.\nFor the installation of the primary sensor, a leveling connection shall be made between the Primary Bench Mark (PBM) and the sensor zero for the purpose of determining the sensor zero height with respect to the SD. For the acoustic sensor, the sensor zero is the AquatrakTM Leveling Point (AQLP), which is the top edge of the collar on which the Aquatrak sensor rests. On the ETG, the sensor zero is the ETG reading reference mark, also known as the ZETG, Zero of Electric Tape Gauge. The Paroscientific pressure sensor zero is the vertex of the V-notch in the side of the orifice, or the bottom of the top parallel plate. To make a leveling connection to this sensor zero, a rod stop called the orifice staff stop - that can be leveled as part of the leveling run - is installed at a point above the sensor zero and a calibrated steel tape measurement is made between the sensor zero and the orifice staff stop. Using the height obtained for sensor zero with respect to the SD, the datum offset (also known as Coefficient C2 or DAT), or the orifice offset shall be calculated.\nThe field crew shall then submit the E-Site report, Xpert site report, or Tide Station report via email or fax. Include a copy of the level abstract (and water level transfer form for Great Lakes stations) to OET in addition to a phone call to OET so that sensor parameters can be properly setup in DMS prior to the beginning of the accepted data collection.\nThe Installer shall contact OET (contact information is provided above at the beginning of the section) and CORMS at telephone 301-713-2540, fax 301-713-4392, or e-mail corms@noaa.gov\na) Before performing any maintenance at a station b) After the maintenance is completed c) When a station is installed d) When a station is removed.\nThe above procedure must be followed. If this procedure is not followed in timely fashion prior to beginning of data transmission, data losses may occur. When the station sensors are properly configured in DMS, the data is accessible through the CO-OPS' web site at http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov.\nChanges to the satellite platform ID, or the DCP telephone number, shall be reported to OET and the supporting Field Operations Division (FOD) office immediately via telephone, email, or fax.\nThe Installer/tester shall follow the appropriate throughput testing requirements as described in Reference 24.\n\nStanding Project Instructions for Coastal and Great Lakes Water Level Stations, Updated August 2011\n\nPage 10\n\n\f2.6 Station Installation\nThe installation of water level station DCPs and sensors shall be accomplished according to Reference 1, Reference 2, and the manufacturer's instructions, as applicable. Nearly all of the NWLON stations have the Sutron Xpert System (Xpert DCP and Xpert Dark as redundant DCP) installed as of February 2011.\nAll new station installations, excepting short-term hydro/photo stations, shall undergo an engineering design review in accordance with Section 3 of the ROS. FOD and NWLON O&M contractor engineering design packages for station upgrades and installations shall be reviewed and approved by the CO-OPS Field Engineering Review Subcommittee before any work actually begins on the site. The installer shall obtain all required permits and permissions using CO-OPS approved agreement templates for the installation of the water level sensor(s), DCPs, bench marks, and utilities, as required and provide copies of signed agreements, permits, and permissions to ED and the supporting FOD office as part of the design review process. A complete reconnaissance report and station design heights shall also be submitted. The installer shall be responsible for security and/or protective measures, as required, for protecting the government furnished equipment and facility while installing, maintaining or removing a water level station.\nThe water level station and its various components (tide house, Data Collection Platform, all sensors, meteorological tower, bench marks, and pertinent access facilities such as railings, steps, etc., as appropriate), when designed or installed by contractors, shall be installed and maintained as prescribed by manufacturers installation manuals, appropriate local building codes, or as specified by the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR), if applicable. The water level station and all installed components shall be structurally sound for its intended application, secure, and safe to use for NOS, local partners, and general public, as appropriate.\nThe installer must provide CO-OPS with the GPS position, as noted below in Section 2.9, of all tide gauges and sensors installed before data collection begins, including those that were not specified in the Statement of Work. In cases where gauge location(s) needs to be different than that specified in the Statement of Work, installer shall consult with CO-OPS prior to the installation.\nDigital photographs of water level station components (station, DCP, sensors, well, supporting structure, equipment, and bench marks) shall be taken and submitted. GPS photos shall be taken according to Reference 6.\nA minimum of four photos for each bench mark shall be taken: close-up of the disk face; chest or waist level view of disk and setting; and horizontal views of the location of the bench mark from two different (perpendicular) cardinal directions. Photos shall also be taken of station components such as protective wells, staffs, houses, shelters, met towers, DCPs, sensors, etc. One general location photo shall be taken showing the water level station in relationship to its supporting structure and the local body of water. All digital photographs shall be submitted in JPEG format. All digital station photo files should be named such that the name of the file will\n\nStanding Project Instructions for Coastal and Great Lakes Water Level Stations, Updated August 2011\n\nPage 11\n\n\findicate the station number and the type of photo taken. For example, the acoustic sensor photo for DCP1 at Los Angeles shall be named as 94106601 sensor A1.jpg.\n\nThe station components and bench mark photographs are required when a new station is installed. The bench mark photographs shall be updated whenever any changes are noticed, such as damaged bench mark disk, or changes to settings, etc, or as requested in the station specific requirements.\n\nAll digital station bench mark photo files should be named such that the name of the file will indicate the station number, dash, PID number (if available), dash, stamping or designation, dash, photo type, dash, date, dot.jpg. For a new mark, the PID is not applicable as it is unavailable. A close-up photo showing the face and stamping of the bench mark is photo type 1, an eye level photo showing the bench mark and its setting is photo type 2, and a horizontal view of the bench mark showing nearby landmarks is photo type 3. For photo type 3 include the cardinal direction (N, NE, S, SE, etc) that the camera is pointing. If more than one type of photo is taken for a given view, then re-name them as 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, 3A, 3B, etc. If a PID is available, then use the designation instead of the stamping for the naming of the file. Use a maximum of 30 alpha numeric characters to the left of the dot. If you are exceeding 30 alpha numeric characters in the name, then truncate the stamping or designation so that the maximum number of characters in the name are 30 (including spaces and hyphens). For example, the bench mark E close-up photo for the Seattle water level station should be named as 94471307130E1990-1-20090101.jpg.\n\nSample file names for photo files:\n\nDisk face photo of a new bench mark without a PID Eye level view photo of an existing bench mark with a PID North direction photo of an existing bench mark without a PID\n\n9414290-4290A2008-1-20090101.jpg 9410660-DY2512-BM N-2-20090101.jpg 9447130-7130E1990-3N-20090101.jpg\n\nIn addition, place a caption on each photograph, indicating the stamping or designation of the mark, the PID, the photo type with cardinal direction, and the date of photograph taken. The Windesc program for electronic leveling has a function to assist with the photo caption.\n\nThe above naming convention for the bench mark photo files shall be applicable for all of COOPS' work and OCS hydrographic surveys. For NGS Shoreline mapping projects, contractors shall follow the NGS specifications for file naming of bench mark photos.\n\nNGS Coastal Mapping Surveys require a slightly different file naming convention as described in Attachment R of the NGS Specs which is located at http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/ContractingOpportunities/SOW_Main_Text_V13B_new.pdf . All photos collected for NGS Coastal Mapping Surveys for both contract and in-house projects shall be named according to NGS convention.\n\nStanding Project Instructions for Coastal and Great Lakes Water Level Stations, Updated August 2011\n\nPage 12\n\n\fA completed water level measurement station installation consists of the following:\ne) The installation of the water level measurement system (water level sensor(s), primary and redundant DCP as appropriate, satellite transmitter, ancillary sensors if applicable, other equipment as necessary and its supporting structure, and a staff (if required), as specified in the Annual Station Specific Requirements, or as specified in the contract documents.\nf) The recovery and/or installation of the required minimum number of bench marks and a level connection between the bench marks, Primary Bench Mark (PBM), and the water level sensor(s), or tide staff as appropriate. The minimum number of bench marks or specific marks to be leveled will be specified in the Annual Station Specific Requirements, contract documents, or as specified in Reference 3 (See section 3.3 Levels for additional leveling requirements).\ng) The collection of GPS observations, a minimum four hour session, on one bench mark, and submission of the data through OPUS DB for publishing.\nh) Validation by CO-OPS of complete data transmissions, and proper data ingestion into DMS, as evidenced by the data display on the CO-OPS website.\ni) The preparation of all documentation and data and submission to CO-OPS (ED and supporting FOD field office) in a timely fashion (refer to Section 4 for requirements for timelines, documentation, and points of contacts).\nThe installer shall follow the appropriate sections of the SOP-06-001 as referenced in the Reference 24.\n2.7 Station Maintenance Requirements\nWater level station standard annual maintenance shall be accomplished in accordance with the Appendix F of Reference 1, and the most recent version of the AI checklist, or as instructed by the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), or by the Task Manager (TM). A PDF file or digitally scanned copy of the completed AI checklist shall be submitted for each station annual inspection. The specific maintenance requirements for each water level station will be specified in the Annual Station Specific Requirements for individual task orders for contracts.\nCO-OPS shall monitor the near-real time water level gauge data daily for indications of sensor malfunction or failure, and for degraded or invalid data, when the data is disseminated via GOES telemetry using the NOS satellite message format. This includes data from CO-OPS NWLON stations, and stations supporting hydrographic and photogrammetric surveys where CO-OPS or CO-OPS contractors, Navigational Response Teams (NRT), or NOAA Ships install the subordinate water level gauges. CO-OPS shall not monitor the subordinate stations installed for NOAA contract hydrographic/photogrammetric survey projects by NOAA contractors.\n\nStanding Project Instructions for Coastal and Great Lakes Water Level Stations, Updated August 2011\n\nPage 13\n\n\fThis monitoring can be performed by accessing the CO-OPS web page (http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov). The data over the web are typically available for review within one to four hours after the configuration of the DCP and sensors in DMS during the normal business hours, after the installations of the DCPs and sensors in the field, and once data is reviewed and dissemination is turned on by CORMS.\nDuring annual maintenance visits to a station that has an acoustic sensor, the AquatrakTM sensor and matching cal tube shall be replaced. For stations where wind sensors are installed, wind sensor nose cones shall be replaced during the annual maintenance. The Ultrasonic wind sensor leads (if in question) shall be cleaned with a contact cleaner with a zero residue base. All applicable sensor serial numbers (inside the tide or gauge house) shall be verified by the installer (recorded by one person and confirmed by a second person in the field party). Safety of personnel is of utmost importance and safety gear as necessary shall be used while climbing the towers, etc, when required. Most of the serial numbers of the DCP boards and sensors are generally recorded and verified during the installation, and only when equipment is replaced during the maintenance, then the re-verification of the serial numbers is required. Necessary repairs or alterations to the stations and equipment shall be made and documented on the approved E-Site Report, Xpert Site Report, or Tide Station Report.\nRepairs or alterations required by the Standing Project Instructions or the Annual Station Specific Requirements, but not completed, shall be documented, along with the reasons for the incompletion, on the approved E-Site Report, Xpert Site Report, or Tide Station Report. Each field party crew chief shall provide a draft E-Site report, Xpert Site Report, or Tide Station Report wherever possible, within one day of completion of maintenance and leveling operations to OET.\nThe report(s) shall be completed by the installer before leaving each station; and reviewed by the field team leader or contractor supervisor after completion of the maintenance visit but prior to submission. The reviewed station package shall then be submitted to ED and the supporting FOD field office within 1 month after the completion of the maintenance, or as specified in the contract documents.\nA minimum of 30 days of 6 minute water level data and 15 days of 1 minute tsunami water level data shall be downloaded during each maintenance trip for NWLON stations and the data shall be forwarded to OET as described in Section 4.2.2 Documentation Requirements. Engineering Bulletin # 07-007 \"Downloading (Exporting) Data from the Xpert Log Files using Xterm\" provides information regarding how to download the data from Xpert DCP.\nSizes of the Xpert Log Files (ssp.log, tsu1min.log, and System.log) shall be configured according to the Engineering Bulletin 09-003 \"Update to Xpert Log File Sizes\".\nApproved primer and anti-fouling paint shall be used on all new protective wells and all protective fiberglass/PVC components that will be in water, excluding the acoustic sensor calibration/sounding tube.\n\nStanding Project Instructions for Coastal and Great Lakes Water Level Stations, Updated August 2011\n\nPage 14\n\n\fFor dual orifice pressure sensor configurations, the vertical stability and elevation to the leveling points from each orifice shall be verified, including the distance between the two orifices. To do so measure the elevation of each orifice to the staff-stop using a steel tape graduated in millimeters. Two independent readings shall be taken and they should not vary more than 3 mm, then report the average of the two readings. If the two readings vary more than 3 mm, then take additional readings until two readings are obtained within 3 mm. The mounting assembly for the two orifices shall be checked for structural integrity and the orifices shall be cleaned of biofouling.\nWhen first arriving at a station to perform annual maintenance, check and record the voltage for each battery on all DCP units. Then remove AC power to both the Primary and Redundant systems allowing them to run totally on battery power. After the units have had approximately an hour of transmit loads on the Xpert DCP and at least 2 hours for the 9000 DCP, recheck the voltage. If the battery voltage has dropped significantly (i.e. below 11.7 volts), replace it. Also write the date of installation with permanent marker on each battery, and record this date on the site report. Check all marine grade batteries to ensure that adequate water is in each cell. Use only distilled water for replacement.\nA new battery shall be replaced every four years during the maintenance trip for the NWLON stations, where practical, or make arrangements to replace it at another time. The condition of a newly installed battery shall be checked using the procedure described in the above paragraph during the 2nd or 3rd year maintenance trip, and if the battery condition passes the test described above then replace the battery during the 4th year after the installation. Of course, if a battery does not pass the condition test as described above, then it shall be replaced immediately during that trip and the date of replacement shall be duly noted on the approved E-Site Report (or Xpert Site Report or Tide Station Report, if applicable).\nAll repairs, adjustments, replacements, cleaning, or other actions potentially affecting sensor output or collection of data shall be documented in writing using appropriate approved maintenance forms (refer to Section 5 for requirements for deliverables for water level station documentation and timelines) and retained as part of the water level data record. This documentation shall include, but not be limited to, the following information: date and time (GMT) of the beginning and the end of the maintenance activity; date and time of adjustments of the sensors; changes in the configuration of the DCP - such as a new datum or sensor offset, or setting the time; personnel conducting the work; parts or components replaced; component serial numbers; tests performed and test results; etc.\nProper NOAA identification emblems with an emergency phone number 1 (800)367-6622 shall be placed on all water level gauge house doors or shelters. Emblems which are unreadable should be replaced.\n\nStanding Project Instructions for Coastal and Great Lakes Water Level Stations, Updated August 2011\n\nPage 15\n\n\fA completed station visit for maintenance (scheduled or emergency) consists of the following:\na) The maintenance or repair of the water level measurement system (water level sensor(s), primary and redundant DCP as appropriate, satellite transmitter, ancillary sensors if applicable, other equipment as necessary and its supporting structure, and a staff if applicable), and as specified here in the Standing Project Instructions, the Annual Station Specific Requirements, or as specified in the contract documents.\nb) For scheduled maintenance, the recovery and/or installation of the required minimum number of bench marks and a level connection between the bench marks, PBM, and the water level sensor(s), or tide staff is required. The minimum number of bench marks or specific marks to be leveled will be specified in the Annual Station Specific Requirements, contract documents, or as specified in Reference 3 (See Section 3.3 Levels for additional leveling requirements.)\nFor emergency maintenance, recovery of bench marks and levels are generally not required, unless the maintenance is done which may affect the elevation of the AQLP, or orifice(s) for pressure sensor(s), in which case leveling, to the PBM and at least 2 other marks, is required.\nOnly for scheduled maintenance, GPS observations on one of the bench marks as specified in the Annual Station Specific Requirements, or as specified in the contract documents, may be required.\nc) CO-OPS verification of complete data transmission throughput following maintenance, from station to DMS ingestion.\nd) The preparation and submission of all documentation and data to ED and the supporting FOD field office in a timely fashion (refer to Section 4 for requirements for timelines, documentation, and points of contacts).\nThe maintenance party shall follow the appropriate sections of the SOP-06-001 as referenced in the Reference 24.\n2.7.1 Additional Requirements for NOAA Sentinels NOAA Sentinels are water level observing stations which have been strengthened to deliver realtime storm tide data during severe coastal events. Elevated atop substantial single pile platforms, these stations are specifically designed to withstand category four hurricanes. NOAA Sentinels measure and disseminate real-time water level and meteorological observations. All of this information helps coastal authorities prepare for, mitigate, and respond to storm tides generated by severe coastal storms.\n\nStanding Project Instructions for Coastal and Great Lakes Water Level Stations, Updated August 2011\n\nPage 16\n\n\fThe following are the additional maintenance requirements for the NOAA Sentinel stations currently installed in the Gulf of Mexico:\n\nEvery Year:\n\n Examine the anode and the anode attachment points. Inspect the attachment points for excess corrosion and inability to remove fasteners. Provide measurements of the smallest cross sectional area of the anode. Provide underwater photos of the anode and close-ups of any excessive anode shrinkage or attachment point corrosion.\n\nEvery 2 years:\n\n Inspect all painted surfaces for rust. Document significant rust areas in the Excel or ESite station report and provide photos of the occurrences. The repair of significant rust areas shall be added to the following year's project instructions along with procedures for coating repair.\n\n Inspect all galvanized surfaces for rust. Document significant rust areas in the Excel or ESite station report and provide photos of the occurrences. Repair spot rust with a wire brush and cold galvanizing.\n\n Inspect all welds for rust and cracks. Provide photos and document excessive rust and cracks.\n\n Check all fasteners on the protective well clamps, including half moon clamps, adjustable arms, and attachment to clamp brackets. Tighten if loose.\n\n Check the fasteners holding the solar panel mount to the railing. Tighten if loose.\n\n Check all fasteners holding the enclosure to the support stand and the stand to the deck grating. Also check the bracketing system along the upper portion of the enclosure. Tighten if loose.\n\n Check all fasteners on the Rohn tower. Tighten if loose.\n\n Examine the underside of the high platform. Inspect the high platform bridge bolts for looseness and rust. Document and tighten any loose bolts.\n\n Examine the galvanized conduit for rust and cracks. Check also for water in the conduit entering the bottom of the enclosure.\n\n Examine the solar panel and Rohn tower flexible conduits for cracks and loose fitting/tubing connections.\n\n Grease the davit and winch. Examine for corrosion.\nStanding Project Instructions for Coastal and Great Lakes Water Level Stations, Updated August 2011\n\nPage 17\n\n\fEvery 5 Years:\n Replace the battery pack in the Aid to Navigation light\n2.7.2 Additional Requirements for Great Lakes Stations\n The shaft angle encoders shall be inspected to insure the offset pulleys are not binding. Lift the float tape off of the offset pulley and free spin the unit. If any binding occurs, replace the bearing in the center of the gear. In addition and while the float tape is off of the encoder gear and pulley, spin the encoder shaft to represent both a 2 meter increase and a 2 meter decrease in the readings from the present reading. Then match the reading with the ETG reference and reset the tape back on the gear and pulley. After this process, remember to check the tape at the float connection to ensure that it has not kinked. This rotation procedure will ensure that the oil lubrication around the enclosed encoder bearings remains fluid. NOTE: - This test should only be performed during the time period that the DCP is not calculating the water level reading. This time period, for computing the water level reading, is 90 seconds before and after the allotted 6 minute interval. Also check to see that the float tape length has been installed such that the float neither tops out nor the counterweight bottom out before reaching its extreme limitations.\n The float shall be inspected for corrosion and leaks; replace as necessary.\n When closing off the intake valve note how many turns it takes to close off the intake as well as how many turns it takes to fully open it. This shall be reported in the remarks on the inspection sheet and on a tag placed on the valve handle. Also note the difficulty in turning the valve such that it can be predicted when the valve would become unusable and need replacement.\n A water level transfer (inside/outside check) shall be performed at each station and documented on the Site Report. The inside/outside water level must agree to within 0.006 m. The best time to perform a transfer is in the early morning or late evening when the water level is most calm. The above procedure must be followed and actions taken to correct any discrepancies.\n When diving at gauge sites measure and report the elevation of intake invert and valve invert on IGLD 85, if not previously noted. NOTE: The invert elevation is the point where the water level can no longer be measured accurately. If the intake has a gooseneck at the end this measurement should be taken at the lowest point in the curve at the top of the gooseneck, not the opening.\n Install rubber flaps over all locks on gauge shelters for protection against the weather. The locks shall be inspected and lubricated to enable easy access.\n\nStanding Project Instructions for Coastal and Great Lakes Water Level Stations, Updated August 2011\n\nPage 18\n\n\f Check gauge houses inside, outside, and around the doorframe for openings in the mortar and caulk as required. Submit a statement of work to FOD for any work recommended for completion by a contractor.\n Check gauge house structure, door, and frame for rust and paint chips. Scrape and paint as necessary.\n2.8 Ancillary Sensor Metadata\nThe meteorological sensor site selection and measurement guidelines are listed in Reference 12.\nSpecific metadata for ancillary sensors is required as detailed below. The installer shall make note of this data in the remarks section of the Ancillary Sensor boxes on the approved Site Report or E-Site report. Metadata documentation shall be completed during the annual inspections, or emergency maintenance visits, as appropriate, for all stations with ancillary sensors. A unique Temporary Bench Mark (TBM) may be selected at each station and all the required measurements can be referenced to that TBM. The TBM must be connected via levels to the PBM. Then ED will relate the sensor elevations to SD and other datums as appropriate.\nPhotos shall be taken of the supporting structure and all of the ancillary sensors installed. The photos should include as many of the four cardinal compass directions as possible, with the file name indicating the direction of the view, i.e. 87617241 Met tower looking south.jpg. Photos and sensor elevations must be submitted by CO-OPS to the National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) in a timely manner before NDBC will accept the met data into its quality control process. Annual photos of the met mast and ancillary sensors are not required once the sensors have been installed. Wind sensors shall be aligned according to Reference 11.\n\nAncillary Sensor Air temperature\nWater temperature\nBarometric pressure\nWind Speed/Direction/Gust\nConductivity Relative humidity\n\nSensor Elevation Reference Point\nCenter of the sensor above the station datum and above ground to the nearest +/- 15 centimeter.\nCenter of the sensor above the station datum as derived from subtracting the distance from the leveling point to the center of the sensor from the C2 value, to the nearest centimeter.\nSurface of the pressure port above MSL (see Barometer Calibration Guidelines) to the nearest +/- 15 centimeter.\nCenter of the sensor above the station datum and above ground to the nearest +/- 15 centimeter.

The positions of the primary and backup DCP and all sensors that are installed in a tide house (gauge house) shall be recorded as that of a station. This position will be obtained in front of the tide house (gauge house) at the center of the front door/front wall of the tide house (gauge house). The front portion of the roof of the tide house (gauge house) may also be used as applicable if the GPS satellites are blocked from the structure. For a standalone DCP or met sensors that are 3 m (10 ft) or greater from the station, obtain positions and report appropriately on the Site Report.\n\nFor barometers which are generally installed in the tide house, report the latitude and longitude as that of the station, but report the elevation above station datum as obtained from the leveling.\n\nFor Aquatrak sensors or Paroscientific sensors that are installed 3 m (10 ft) or greater from the station location, obtain the positions of the sensors at the center of the sensor. If the Aquatrak sensor or Paroscientific sensor is installed inside a tide house (gauge house), then report the latitude and longitude as that of the station, but report the elevation above station datum.\n\nFor bench marks, obtain positions using the hand-held GPS receiver by placing the receiver on the (horizontal) bench mark. For bench marks that are installed vertically, obtain the position as close to the mark as satellite coverage will allow.\n\nHandheld GPS units come with either patch antennas or quadrifilar antennas. The proper method for holding the GPS unit is vertically if the unit has a quadrifilar antenna, or horizontally if the unit has a patch antenna. Holding the unit otherwise will degrade the reception of the satellite signals and reduce the accuracy of the position obtained. The Garmin GPSmap 76S units used by CO-OPS have quadrifilar antennas.\n\nTake a digital photo of the GPS unit display for each location acquired. This will insure verification of the latitude and longitude that is entered into the Excel and E-Site reports.\n\n2.10 Gauge Removal\n\nThe installer shall remove a water level station, if required, and as specified in the Annual Station Specific Requirements, or as specified in the contract documents. A complete removal of the water level measurement station consists of the following:\n\na) Closing levels - a level connection between the PBM and all the bench marks in the local leveling network at the station, the water level sensor(s), and/or staff, if applicable.\n\nStanding Project Instructions for Coastal and Great Lakes Water Level Stations, Updated August 2011\n\nPage 20\n\n\fb) Removal of the water level measurement system and restoration of the premises, assuming reasonable wear and tear. The property owner shall be notified prior to removal and thanked for supporting our programs.\nc) Generally, GPS observations on one bench mark are done during the installation for short term stations. If GPS observations are not done during the installation phase, and GPS observations are required, then GPS observations shall be done during the gauge removal time. Generally, GPS observations are required only one time for short term stations. For NWLON and long term stations, the frequency of the GPS observations is determined by the rate of sea level change at the station and if the GPS observations are required for a specific year, those will be listed in the station specific project instructions.\nd) The preparation of all documentation and data and submission to CO-OPS (ED and supporting FOD field office) in a timely fashion (refer to Section 4 for requirements for timelines, documentation, and points of contacts).\ne) Return of all government equipment to appropriate supporting CO-OPS' FOD field office(s) in timely fashion within 15 days of station removal.\n\nStanding Project Instructions for Coastal and Great Lakes Water Level Stations, Updated August 2011\n\nPage 21\n\n\f3 BENCH MARKS AND LEVELS\n\n3.1 Reference Documents\nBench marks and level operations shall be performed in accordance with Reference 3. CO-OPS electronic/barcode level operations shall be performed in accordance with Reference 31 and the Leica Manual for the DNA03 level. Help files for the TOPCON and Trimble level instruments can be found in the Windesc and Translev programs available from NGS.\nBench mark descriptions shall be written in accordance with Appendix E of Reference 4 for bench marks that are connected using the electronic levels. Descriptions for Great Lakes bench marks shall be written in accordance with the NGS Bluebook, Formats and Specifications of the National Geodetic Survey Data Base http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/FGCS/BlueBook/, since those marks are not published by CO-OPS.\nBench mark descriptions shall be written in accordance with Reference 5 for bench marks that are connected using the optical levels, where electronic levels are not used, or as specified in the contract documents.\n\n3.2 Bench Marks\n\nUnless specified otherwise in the work order or contract documents, the total number of bench marks in the leveling network shall be a minimum of ten marks for the NWLON stations and a minimum of five marks for subordinate stations installed for hydrographic and photogrammetry surveys, special projects, or contract projects for U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, unless otherwise directed by ED.\n\nDescriptions shall be checked by verifying distances with tape measurements in metric units, verifying cited landmarks and using a compass to confirm directions.\n\nThe handheld GPS coordinates of each mark shall be entered in the description file for electronic levels, or noted on the published bench mark sheet or equivalent (for optical levels). The latitude and longitude fields of the bench mark shall be reported in the following format: degrees/minutes/seconds and tenths of seconds. For example, 40 degrees, 45 minutes, 35.2 seconds.\n\nNew bench mark sketches shall use CO-OPS' standard bench mark sketch title block, or electronic equivalent. If a digital sketch is used, submit the digital file in JPG format with the leveling files and photos. If AutoCAD or AutoCAD LT is used to generate the benchmark sketch, both a JPG format and the AutoCAD DWG format shall be submitted. Submission of updated bench mark sketches are required only when necessary to document newly established marks or physical changes in the area.\n\nCO-OPS has photos of nearly all bench mark disk faces, setting, and location shots of NWLON and active subordinate station tidal bench marks. The station specific requirements shall note any\n\nStanding Project Instructions for Coastal and Great Lakes Water Level Stations, Updated August 2011\n\nPage 22\n\n\fadditional photos needed to achieve a complete photo gallery of each mark.\nIf a bench mark is discovered disturbed or mutilated during the visit to a station, include it in the level run to determine if it is holding its elevation relative to the PBM and report it to ED and the supporting FOD field office. ED will make a decision and inform the installer via the next set of Station Specific Requirements regarding the action that needs to be taken: destroying the mark, if it is a NOS mark, or dropping the mark from the leveling network for other marks. If the PBM has been disturbed, contact ED immediately for further direction.\nBefore installing a new mark, perform a 1.6 kilometer (1 mile) radial search from the tide station (DCP) location at NGS web site, http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/datasheet.html to check if any NAVD 88 marks are available that are not part of the local leveling network. Inclusion in the local leveling network of an existing mark(s) that has a NAVD88 elevation, if it is located within a 1.6 KM (1 mile) leveling distance of the station location, is desirable and shall be preferred over installing a new mark. If the bench mark is replaced, then the stamping of the bench mark shall have a new letter designation (assigned by ED) and present year so that the new stamping is different from the original stamping of the mark, or the stamping of other marks in the local leveling network.\nDigital photographs of bench marks shall be taken as described in Section 2.7 Station Installation.\n3.3 Levels\nAll leveling shall be performed with electronic/barcode systems, to either Second Order, Class I or Third Order standards, in accordance with National Geodetic Survey (NGS) standards for geodetic leveling, and CO-OPS \"User's Guide for the Installation of Benchmarks and Leveling Requirements for Water Level Recording Stations, NOAA/NOS October 1987\". Beginning in calendar year 2010, all CO-OPS and contractor field crews are required to use the NGS Windesc description and Translev leveling software. Refer to the \"User's Guide for Electronic Levels with Translev and Windesc, Updated September 2010\"\nIf digital bar-code leveling systems are to be used, the model should have been previously evaluated by the Federal Geodetic Control Subcommittee (FGCS). These systems include the Leica NA3003, Leica DNA03, Topcon DL101C, Trimble DiNi 12, Zeiss DiNi 10, DiNi 11, DiNi 12 and DiNi 12T. Bench mark descriptions and leveling output must be in a NGS-supported format to enable processing and adjustment of the levels by NGS. Station bench mark descriptions and recovery notes shall be submitted in computer-readable form using WinDesc software. The basic WinDesc usage instructions are built into the program. You simply go under the HELP menu when you run WinDesc. Field book and field abstract software are required and are dependent on the leveling equipment used for this project. Translev is a NGS program that facilitates the process of editing, formatting and checking digital leveling observation data and creates abstracts, bok files, and VERTOBS datasets for submission to the National Geodetic Survey (NGS). WinDesc and Translev are the two programs currently being used by CO-OPS to\n\nStanding Project Instructions for Coastal and Great Lakes Water Level Stations, Updated August 2011\n\nPage 23\n\n\fsubmit leveling data to NGS. NGS training is available if needed. These NGS programs are available online at http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/PC_PROD/pc_prod.shtml.\n\nCO-OPS will provide appropriate training to contractors in the use of the Windesc and Translev software for leveling operations,\n\nSecond-order Class I leveling connections shall be made from the primary water level sensor (AQLP or pressure sensor orifice [staff stop], and in the Great Lakes the ETG RM and the Spike RM) to a minimum of 5 bench marks on an annual basis, including the primary bench mark (PBM). In the case of pressure sensors as primary sensors, the elevation of orifice zero to orifice staff stop(s) shall be measured annually using a calibrated steel tape with millimeter graduations, and elevation of the orifice staff stop(s) to PBM shall be determined using the conventional leveling equipment.\n\nAs described in the \"User's Guide for the Installation of Bench Marks and Leveling Requirements for Water Level Stations, October 1987\" Section 3.3, Page 18, the levels are required and shall be performed for seven cases listed. Particular emphasis is placed on performing the check levels as per the specific project requirements or no later than 6 months after the establishment of a new water level station. This is required for declaring a newly installed water level station operational.\n\nAll of the bench marks in the leveling scheme shall be leveled within a two year period. This may be accomplished by leveling to the PBM and four marks one year, then to the PBM and the remaining marks the next year. In some cases, it may be practical to level to all the marks the second year to reach the furthest marks from the station. A level connection to CORS reference marks shall also be made once every two years, if those marks are within 1.6 KM (1 mile) leveling distance from the water level station. The installer shall be responsible for ensuring that every mark in the station bench mark network is leveled once every two years.\n\nThe two or three meter barcode rods for second order levels shall be used whenever possible at all stations. At stations where three/two meter level rods cannot be utilized due to airline size restrictions, justification for use of the Third Order barcode rods and levels shall be documented on the NGWLMS Site Report. For stations in AK, HI, and Pacific Island areas the Second order class I leveling requirement is waived and the Third Order levels are acceptable.\n\nThe primary water level sensor (ETG in the Great Lakes) shall be connected to the station bench marks by levels. The levels shall be run upon sensor installation, in conjunction with annual maintenance levels, if obvious sensor movement is noticed during regular/emergency maintenance, and upon sensor removal. The levels to the sensor(s) shall be spur runs from any bench mark, it is not necessary to have the spur run directly from the PBM to the sensor(s). If the leveling starts at the sensor then it is not considered a spur run.\n\nAt Great Lakes sites where a spike is unavailable for use in performing a water transfer, (see section 3.1, standing project instructions for a description of procedures to perform water transfers), the water level in the sump shall be compared to the water surface outside the sump by differential leveling and the use of the water level transfer program (h2o-tran). A difference\n\nStanding Project Instructions for Coastal and Great Lakes Water Level Stations, Updated August 2011\n\nPage 24\n\n\fexceeding 0.006 meters indicates a possible restriction in flow, which must be corrected. This instruction must be recognized and initialed. Note: this procedure can best be accomplished in early morning or late evening when the water is most likely to be calm.\nWhen abstracting the raw level data using the electronic digital level system, the PBM shall always be selected as the starting mark, and the AQLP, orifice staff stop, or ETG, as the case may be, shall always be selected as the ending mark. If the original RAW file is edited before processing, the original file (XXXXXXXo.RAW) shall be stored in a separate subdirectory named \"Original RAW\", and submitted with the edited RAW (XXXXXXX.RAW) file and other level files.\nWhile using the electronic levels, any changes made to the description file (XXXXXXX.DES) require that the levels be reprocessed and submitted to ED. Dates of the DES file must be chronologically consistent with the abstract ABS and other files generated. The date of the DES file cannot be later than the date of the ABS file.\nNewly installed barometric sensors shall be included in the level run as a spur. Barometric pressure sensors shall be leveled, or their height otherwise determined in relationship to station datum, during installation, or if the barometer is moved to a new location. Barometric sensors at Great Lakes stations shall be leveled, or their height otherwise determined in relationship to DYNAMIC/IGLD 85. Since small changes in elevation do not change the height correction, the original leveling requirement to the barometer every five years is not needed. The elevation of Mean Sea Level (MSL) above Station Datum in the header information for the specific annual requirements for each station is based upon the 1983-01 tidal datum epoch. The Barometer C2 shall be computed to include both the calibration corrections and height corrections. The installer shall ensure that the new elevation is also correct on the Site Report section for calculation of the barometer C2. The barometer C2s shall be updated in the DCPs during the annual inspections. The SSN for the barometric sensor shall be xx10 if it is included in the electronic leveling, where xx is the part number. At Great Lakes stations, the \"Barometer Installation Worksheet \u00ad Great Lakes\" shall be used to compute the Height of the Barometer above the ETG. Refer to Reference 9 for additional information.\n3.3.1 Leveling to NOAA Sentinels and Elevated Platforms\nLeveling connections on Sentinels and other elevated platforms require a combination of steeltaped height differences between the AQLP or a TBM at deck level (\"deck\" TBM) and a TBM near ground level (\"ground\" TBM), and a standard level run between the \"ground\" TBM and bench mark network.\nTo level from the AQLP to a TBM that can be included in the standard level run a TBM shall be chosen that can be leveled to the existing bench mark network using the standard barcode rod. This \"ground\" TBM shall be named and described per Reference 5 so that surveyors can level to the exact same TBM in future level runs during the maintenance of the Sentinel or elevated platform. The point where the taped measurement is made is critical in this description. This TBM shall also be placed in a position where a taped measurement can be made from the TBM\n\nStanding Project Instructions for Coastal and Great Lakes Water Level Stations, Updated August 2011\n\nPage 25\n\n\fto the AQLP. If this is not possible, another TBM at the deck level of the Sentinel or elevated platform shall be chosen, then named and described per Reference 5, again with care to include the point of measurement in the description. This \"deck\" TBM shall be connected to the AQLP using standard leveling procedures.\nThe steel taped distance from the \"ground\" TBM to the AQLP or \"deck\" level TBM shall be performed on a windless day. A plumb bob shall be dropped from the AQLP or \"deck\" TBM to insure that the steel tape is held as vertical as possible. A set of five readings each shall be made by a minimum of two people for a total of ten readings. Each reading shall have the zero of the steel tape positioned at the high point of the \"ground\" TBM and the elevation shall be read from the tape at the AQLP or the high point of the \"deck\" TBM. The steel tape shall also be moved away from the TBMs and repositioned for each reading. The ten readings shall be averaged to acquire the height between the \"ground\" TBM and the AQLP or \"deck\" TBM.\nThe averaged steel tape height shall be entered into the DNA03 so that it is abstracted in to the level run. This is done by manually entering a zero for the staff height on the \"ground\" TBM as the Backsight, then entering the positive value of the averaged steel tape height for the Foresight of the Forward Run. During the Backward Run, enter zero for the Backsight, then a negative value of the averaged steel tape height for the Foresight. This will put the height of the AQLP or \"deck\" TBM into the abstract when the levels are processed using Translev.\n\n3.3.2 Leveling to Temporary Bench Marks (TBM) Due to leveling to meteorological sensors and water level sensors connected to DCPs other than DCP 1, the designation for TBMs shall be changed to include the full 8 digit station number: XXX XXXXY, where XXX XXXX is the Station ID, and Y is the DCP number. For example: If the barometer is installed on DCP 1 at 8410140 Eastport, the designation shall be TBM 841 01401 Barometer. If the barometer is installed on DCP 2, the designation shall be TBM 841 01402 Barometer. This format shall be used for all SENSOR TBMs\nIn addition, there have been several new water level TBMs added that are standardized in the following table. Use the designations below to correctly identify the orifice and microwave water level leveling point at a water level station. Due to the character limitations in WinDesc and Translev, it may be also be necessary to assign an alias.\n\nLeveling Point (LP) Designation\nTBM xxx xxxxx Single Orifice LP TBM xxx xxxxx Dual Orifice LP* TBM xxx xxxxx Upper Orifice LP** TBM xxx xxxxx Lower Orifice LP** TBM xxx xxxxx MWWL LP\n\nLeveling Point Alias\nSingle Orifice LP\nDual Orifice LP\nUpper Orifice LP Lower Orifice LP\nMWWL LP\n\nSensor Zero Measurement Point\nDesignation Single Orifice Zero Upper Orifice Zero Lower Orifice Zero Upper Orifice Zero\nLower Orifice Zero N/A\n\nStanding Project Instructions for Coastal and Great Lakes Water Level Stations, Updated August 2011\n\nPage 26\n\n\f*For Dual Paros installations sharing the orifice LP use the designation TBM xxx xxxxx Dual Orifice LP.\n**For Dual Paros installations with separate orifice LPs for the upper and lower orifice, use the designations TBM xxx xxxxx Upper Orifice LP and TBM xxx xxxxx Lower Orifice LP.\n3.4 Datum Offsets and Accepted Orifice Offset\nThe leveling connection to an acoustic sensor shall be done at the AQLP. The AQLP is defined as the top shoulder of the mounting plate collar on the calibration tube. In order to facilitate rod holding, a prefabricated leveling fixture may be slipped over the sounding tube to rest on the leveling point. The height of the leveling fixture, as inscribed on the fixture, shall be compensated for in the leveling record (abstract). The level abstract shall show the elevation of the leveling point only. A barcoded rule or stainless steel rule, with metric graduation (mm) and the zero at the end of the rule, as appropriate, may be used in lieu of the leveling fixture by holding the rule directly on the leveling point. In cases where the leveling point is too high for a rod shot, the leveling fixture designed for a down shot shall be utilized and the readings recorded to reflect the down shot. Use of other leveling fixtures and leveling techniques must be approved in advance by ED.\nThe leveling connection to an ETG shall be done at the reading mark (RM). A barcoded rule (60 cm scale) or stainless steel rule, with metric graduation (mm) and the zero at the end of the rule, as appropriate, may be used by holding the rule directly on the RM.\nThe AQLP elevation above station datum is defined as the Datum Offset and is computed by algebraically adding the PBM elevation above SD to the acoustic sensor elevation above/below the PBM. The Datum Offset is also referred to as Coefficient C2 for the Sutron 9000 DCP and as DAT coefficient for the Sutron Xpert DCP.\nThe orifice zero elevation for the Paroscientific pressure sensor(s) above or below the SD is defined as the Accepted Orifice Offset and is computed by algebraically adding the PBM elevation above SD to the (sensor) orifice zero elevation above/below the PBM. The orifice zero elevation is considered to be the point of the V on the brass orifice. For dual orifice systems the orifice offsets are established for both \"N1\" and T1\" pressure sensors.\nAt Great Lakes stations, the Dynamic Height of the ETG RM, plus or minus the Hydraulic Corrector, at all lake stations, defines the IGLD 85 datum offset. In the Great Lakes Rivers and Connecting Channels stations the \"Dynamic Height = IGLD 85\", Hydraulic Correctors are not applied. This datum offset is applied to the Primary Water Level C2 and should only be changed by ED after reviewing the abstract and Water Level Transfer.\nWhen using the electronic/barcode leveling system, all five decimal places shall be used to determine the Datum Offset on the approved site report. After adding or subtracting the difference between the leveling point and PBM, to the elevation of the PBM above the SD, round off the five place value of the Datum Offset to four places. Rounding shall be done to the even\n\nStanding Project Instructions for Coastal and Great Lakes Water Level Stations, Updated August 2011\n\nPage 27\n\n\fnumber, for example: 1.53455 is rounded to 1.5346. A note shall be made to the effect that the existing Datum Offset was retained in the DCP, or the new Datum Offset was entered with date and GMT time it was entered. When new Datum Offset is entered into the DCP, additional notification is required as listed below under Section 3.5 Movement. For stations that have the Paroscientific pressure sensor(s) as primary sensor(s), the change of accepted orifice offsets shall be documented on the Site Report with GMT date and time, and additional notification is required as listed below under Section 3.5 Movement.\nIf optical leveling equipment is used, then all elevations shall be recorded to the tenth of a millimeter level (e.g. 12.3457 m) on the leveling abstract.\nAfter documenting the dynamic elevation for the ETG and SPIKE at Great Lakes stations, round to four places and apply these elevations to the \"Water Level Transfer\" program. Then apply the Hydraulic Corrector utilizing the sign, negative or positive in the program. This elevation is now the hydraulically corrected reference elevation, Zero Electric Tape Gauge (ZETG) and is then rounded to three places and entered in the DCP as Primary Water Level C2. C2 will not be changed unless the elevation differs by greater than + 0.003 meters and only then after notification and review by ED.\nWhen setting up the encoder offset at Great Lakes stations, the C2 in the Xpert DCP (sensor 14, coefficient 2 in the 9000 DCP) will need to be zeroed (0.000). The encoder gear will then be turned to reference 6.000 M on the display. Then an ETG reading will be obtained and subtracted from the 6.000 M reference. This difference, called the initial C2, is then stored in the Xpert DCP (sensor 14 coefficient 2 in the 9000 DCP). All ETG/Display readings have to be within 0.003 m. If not, the set up procedure must be performed again. NOTE: This procedure can best be accomplished in early morning or late evening when the water is most likely to be calm or by closing off the valve.\nThe accepted PBM elevation above IGLD85 in meters shall be used as the starting elevation on the level abstract at Great Lakes stations. This method results in all bench mark elevations referenced directly to IGLD85.\nAt coastal sea level stations, the accepted PBM elevation above the SD in meters shall be used as the starting elevation on the level abstract. This method results in all bench mark elevations referenced directly to the SD. \"Old\" (before sensor swap) and \"new\" (after sensor swap) AQLP connections, if required, shall be treated as spurs. Regardless of whether the acoustic sensor head is swapped or not, the leveling shall be done only once after the sounding tube has been cleaned and everything is put in place. For stations that have acoustic sensors installed, upon initial inspection of the station, if the installer suspects a movement of the well or that of the AQLP, then leveling shall be done twice, once before disturbing the well or sounding tube for cleaning and then after repairing the well or cleaning the sounding tube. For stations that have pressure sensor(s) installed, upon initial inspection of the station, if the installer suspects a movement of the orifice(s), then leveling shall be done twice, once before disturbing the orifice(s) and then after repositioning/securing of the orifice(s).\n\nStanding Project Instructions for Coastal and Great Lakes Water Level Stations, Updated August 2011\n\nPage 28\n\n\f3.5 Movement\n\nThe movement of an entity, such as (a) AQLP, (b) pressure orifice zero, or (c) bench mark is defined as change in elevation of the entity in excess of 0.0060 m (0.020 foot) as obtained by comparing the current difference in elevation of the entity with PBM, with the previous difference in elevation of the entity with PBM. For acoustic sensors this difference shall be compared to what is stored in the DCP and appropriate action shall be taken as described below. For pressure sensor orifices this difference shall be compared with the accepted orifice offset as listed on the site report (and stored in DMS) because the accepted orifice offset is not stored in the DCP and appropriate action as described below shall be taken.\nThe movement shall be noted in the remarks box of the leveling section of the approved site report. If the Datum Offset determined from the latest level run indicates a deviation exceeding 0.0060 meter from the value presently stored in the field unit, and the PBM has remained stable, the new Datum Offset shall be entered into the field unit (no verification levels required) after consultation with ED. If the PBM is determined to be unstable, and other bench mark differences remain within the 0.0060 m allowable, the Datum Offset in the field unit shall not be changed. The suspected movement of the PBM shall be specifically noted, as instructed above, for further action by ED. At Great Lakes stations, if the Primary Water Level Coefficient 2 (C2) determined from the latest levels indicates a deviation exceeding 0.003 meter from the value presently stored in the field unit, and the PBM has remained stable, contact ED within 24 hours and provide the leveling abstract and Water Level Transfer.\nED and the supporting FOD field office shall be notified by phone or email immediately when the Datum Offset is changed in the DCP, or the accepted orifice offset has changed more than +/0.0060 m. An email (nos.coops.oetteam@noaa.gov), fax copy of the level abstract (fax 301-7134465), and a phone call (telephone 301-713-2897) if possible, must be received by ED and supporting FOD field office within 24 hours of the change. Contact information for FOD field offices are listed in Section 4.2.3.\n\n3.6 Geodetic Connections\n\nWater level datums are local vertical datums which may vary considerably within a geographical area. A geodetic datum is a reference surface relative to which heights are determined. The North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD 88) is the accepted vertical datum of the National Spatial Reference System (NSRS) for the conterminous United States and Alaska and is officially supported by NGS. The relationships of tidal datums to geodetic datums such as NAVD 88 and to ellipsoid heights (above GRS 80 ellipsoid) support many hydrographic, coastal mapping, and engineering applications including monitoring of sea level changes, the deployment of GPS Electronic Chart Display and Information Systems (ECDIS), and the NOS Vertical Datum (VDatum) transformation tool.\n\nExisting Geodetic Bench Marks (GBM) in the vicinity (up to 1.6 km (1 mile) leveling distance) of a water level station (primary and subordinate) shall be searched for and recovered. If a mark\n\nStanding Project Instructions for Coastal and Great Lakes Water Level Stations, Updated August 2011\n\nPage 29\n\n\fis either not recovered or not used in the survey/project, a separate report shall be made using the NGS on-line Mark Recovery Entry Form at http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/ngs-cgibin/recvy_entry_www.prl\nThe connection to geodetic datums involves the following three leveling ties:\n1) NAVD88 Level Tie 2) NAD 83 GPS Tie 3) NAVD88 GPS Tie\nAn orthometric level connection and ellipsoidal GPS tie are required at each water level station (primary and subordinate) which has at least one GBM located nearby (within 1.6 km (1 mi) leveling distance of a water level station).\nThe required \"NAVD 88 Level Tie\" is described in this document and the required \"NAD 83 GPS Tie\" and \"NAVD GPS Tie\" are described in Reference 6.\n3.6.1 NAVD 88 Level Tie\nThere are two parts for this requirement as described below in A and B.\n(A) NAVD 88 Level Tie: At all water level stations, a valid level tie to at least two GBM is required on each set of levels, where appropriate GBM marks are available within 1.6 KM (1 mi) leveling distance of the station location. A GBM is defined as a bench mark that exists, is useable, is available in the NGS database, has a Permanent ID (PID), and has a NAVD 88 elevation published on the datasheet. At many NWLON stations, the Primary Bench Mark (PBM) is a GBM. At the majority of NWLON stations, there are two or more tidal bench marks that are also GBM, thus increasing the chance that the geodetic level tie would be valid.\nMake a Second-Order, Class 1 level tie to NAVD88 for all NWLON stations in the conterminous United States and Caribbean Islands. A Third-Order tie is used for all NWLON stations in Alaska, Hawaii, and Pacific Island areas.\nAt stations supporting hydrographic or shoreline mapping surveys, or other special projects, the tie shall be consistent with the accuracy of the levels required for the project (e. g. 2nd order class 1 or 3rd order levels, etc.).\nThe Translev leveling program includes a check function that will tell the user if a two mark tie to NAVD88 has been successful. Information on performing a valid level tie is also provided in the Federal Geodetic Control Committee (FGCC) Standards and Specifications for Geodetic Control Networks, listed at the following website: http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/FGCS/tech_pub/1984-stds-specs-geodetic-control-networks.htm#3.5\nAlso, Section 3.4 of \"User's Guide for the Installation of Bench Marks and Leveling Requirements for Water Level Stations, October 1987\" provides the same information regarding\n\nStanding Project Instructions for Coastal and Great Lakes Water Level Stations, Updated August 2011\n\nPage 30\n\n\fhow to perform a valid level tie. The information in User's Guide is easier to follow as it is written in layman's terms.\n\nThe Second-Order, Class 1 tie is a requirement for digital levels to be accepted into the NGS database. Short level runs to the sensor, PBM, and two marks are excluded from this requirement since they are usually meant to verify sensor stability only. Since a level connection to GBMs with dynamic heights defines the International Great Lakes Datum of 1985 (IGLD 85) datum offset at each station in the Great Lakes, a valid connection to at least two GBMs (within a mile of station location) is required at each site.\n\nA note shall be made in the remarks of the leveling section of the Site Report that a valid tie was achieved or not achieved. If a valid tie is not achieved, an explanation shall be provided and/or recommendations made for making a valid tie in the future.\n\nIf a successful NAVD 88 level tie is performed, then NAVD 88 elevations for all the bench marks in the local leveling network (10 for NWLON and 5 for subordinate stations) can be determined for the NOS Vertical Datum transformation (VDatum) program.\n\nIf the water level station does not have two or more GBMs within 1.6 km (1 mi) leveling distance of the station location, then the NAVD 88 level tie requirement is waived.\n\n(B) NAVD 88 Level connection: An orthometric level connection is required at each water level station (primary and subordinate) which has at least one GBM located within 1.6 km (1 mi) leveling distance of a water level station. If the water level station has two or more GBM within 1.6 km (1 mi) of radial distance of the station location, then perform a NAVD 88 Level Tie (as described above in A) which fulfills the requirement for NAVD 88 level connection.\n\nA successful NAVD 88 level connection to a GBM will help determine the approximate NAVD 88 elevations for the all the bench marks in the local leveling network (10 for NWLON and 5 for subordinate stations) for the NOS VDatum program.\n\nIf there are no GBM within 1.6 km (1 mi) leveling distance of the station location, then the requirement for NAVD 88 level connection requirement is waived.\n\n3.6.2 Leveling at CORS\n\nFor any NGS Continuously Operating Reference System (CORS) reference bench mark that is located within 1.6 km (1 mi) leveling distance of a water level station DCP, a leveling connection shall be made to the tidal bench marks in the water level station network every two years.\n\nInformation about NGS CORS stations can be obtained at http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/CORS/.\n\nAs of 2010, there are a limited number of water level stations in this category, but NGS and COOPS are attempting to secure funding to establish additional co-located sites to support long-term sea level trends monitoring.\n\nStanding Project Instructions for Coastal and Great Lakes Water Level Stations, Updated August 2011\n\nPage 31\n\n\f3.6.3 GPS Connections\nAn orthometric level connection and ellipsoidal GPS tie are required at each water level station (primary and subordinate) which has at least one GBM located nearby (within 1.6 km (1 mi) leveling distance of a water level station).\nGPS connections involve the following two ties:\n1) NAD 83 GPS Tie 2) NAVD88 GPS Tie\nThe required \"NAD 83 GPS Tie\" and \"NAVD GPS Tie\" are described in Reference 6.\n\nStanding Project Instructions for Coastal and Great Lakes Water Level Stations, Updated August 2011\n\nPage 32\n\n\f4 SCHEDULE, REPORTS, AND DELIVERABLES\n\n4.1 Schedule and Reports\nOperations schedules are prepared for all water level stations each September for the upcoming fiscal year.

The field observation procedures are developed in collaboration with the National Ocean Service (NOS), National Geodetic Survey (NGS), and consist of slight modifications of NOAA Technical Memorandum NOS NGS-58, Version 4.3, as described below, to obtain relative accuracy in connecting water level stations to the International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF) and the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD 83) coordinate systems. Modifications made to NOAA Technical Memorandum NOS NGS-58 guidelines and requirements involve the length of the GPS observations required, in this document. This Guide must be used in conjunction with NGS-58 for collecting the GPS data at water level stations.\n\nIt is assumed that the field personnel are familiar with the basic operating principles of the GPS equipment, the cable connections and the antenna/tripod setup procedures. A detailed discussion of GPS processing software and processing procedures is outside the scope of this Guide. GPS data collected by CO-OPS or CO-OPS' contractors for the National Water Level Observation Network (NWLON), for hydrographic and photogrammetric surveys either by NOS Office of Coast Survey (OCS) and NGS field parties will be submitted to NGS for data processing \u00ad \"blue-booking\" is a term used to describe this processing according to the Input Formats and Specifications of the National Geodetic Survey Database, Appendix L \u00ad Guidelines for Submitting GPS Relative Positioning Data.\n\nAll GPS data must be collected as per NGS specifications and as described later in this document and processed first using NGS Online Positioning User Service (OPUS). All GPS data and documentation shall be submitted to CO-OPS, which will then be forwarded to NGS, as per the contracts, project instructions, statement of work, or as appropriate.\n\n1.1. Reference Documents\n\nThe following reference documents are referred in various sections of this document.\n\n(1) \"CO-OPS GPS Observations Implementation Plan, January 2003\".\n\n(2) \"NOAA Technical Memorandum \"NOS NGS-58, Guidelines for Establishing GPS-Derived Ellipsoid Heights (Standards 2 cm and 5 cm), Version 4.3\".\n\n(3) \"User's Guide for the Installation of Bench Marks and Leveling Requirements for Water Level Stations, October 1987\".\n\n(4) \"Standards and Specifications for Geodetic Control Networks\", Federal Geodetic Control\n\nUser's Guide for GPS Observations, Updated March 2007\n\nPage 1\n\n\fCommittee, September 1984.\n(5) \"Attachment R, Requirements for Digital Photographs of Survey Control, NGS, July 2005\"\n2.0. Equipment and Setup\nHigh accuracy static differential GPS surveys require a geodetic quality, dual frequency, fullwavelength GPS receiver with a minimum of 10 channels for tracking GPS satellites. A choke ring antenna is preferred; however, any geodetic quality ground plane antenna may be used. More important than antenna type, i.e. choke ring or ground plane, is that the same antennas or identical antennas models should be used during the entire observing sessions. If not, a correction for the difference in antenna phase patterns (modeled phase patterns) must be applied. This is extremely critical for obtaining precise vertical results. The antenna cable length between the antenna and receiver should be kept to a minimum when possible; 10 meters is the typical antenna cable length. If a longer antenna cable is required, the cable must be fabricated from low loss coaxial cable (RG233 for up to 30 meters and RG214 over 30 meters).\nA fixed height precise GPS antenna tripod is required for this type of a survey. This is a fixed height, 2 meter pole with three adjustable legs, a bulls-eye bubble to plumb the antenna, and a magnetic compass to align the antenna to North. These fixed height tripods reduce the chance of introducing a Height of Instrument (HI) \"blunder\" during the post-processing of the data. There are situations where it may be necessary to use the adjustable precise GPS antenna tripod, such as when a bench mark is elevated above ground level or when using air transportation. The center pole is adjustable on this tripod; therefore, if not fully extended to the 2 meter position, the antenna height is measured with a steel tape (several times) and entered into the receiver and onto the GPS Observation Log Sheet. In fact, even in the 2 meter position, it is recommended that the adjustable tripod be measured to verify the length. There is a screw-on point at the bottom of the center pole of both - the fixed and adjustable tripods - that must be inspected each time the tripod is setup to ensure that the point is tight and not bent. The tripod must be stable during observations; therefore, the tripod legs must be secured, preferably with sand bags.\nAntenna set-up is critical to the success of the project. Plumbing bubbles on the antenna pole of the fixed-height tripod must be shaded when plumbness is determined. Plumbing bubbles must be shaded for at least 3 minutes before checking and/or re-plumbing.\nThe manufacturer, model, and complete serial numbers of all receivers and antennas must be included for each occupation on each station/bench mark observation log sheet as shown in Figure 3.\n\nUser's Guide for GPS Observations, Updated March 2007\n\nPage 2\n\n\f3.0 Geodetic connections and datums relationship\nWater level datums are local vertical datums which may change considerably within a geographical area. A geodetic datum is a reference surface relative to which heights are determined. The North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD 88) is the accepted vertical datum of the National Spatial Reference System (NSRS) for the conterminous United States and Alaska and is officially supported by NGS. The relationship of tidal datums to NAVD 88 has many hydrographic, coastal mapping and engineering applications including monitoring sea level change and the deployment of GPS electronic chart display and information systems, etc.\nExisting geodetic marks in the vicinity of a subordinate tidal station shall be searched for and recovered. A search routine is available at http://www.ngs.noaa.gov. An orthometric level connection and ellipsoidal GPS tie is required at a subordinate tide station which has at least one geodetic bench mark located nearby as stated below for Sections \"NAVD 88 Level Tie\" and \"NAD 83 GPS Tie\" requirements. NAVD 88 heights for published bench marks are given in Helmert orthometric height units by NGS. The GPS ellipsoid network height accuracies are classified as conforming to 2 cm or 5 cm standards accuracies (Refer to NOAA Technical Memorandum NOS NGS-58). At the present time, GPS ellipsoid heights conforming to the 2 cm accuracy standards are required for all GPS survey projects.\nA connection to the geodetic datums at a water level station enhances the value of the tidal data, allowing comparison with other data sets. The geodetic network essentially serves as a global reference datum to which all tidal datums can be referenced.\nThe connection to geodetic datums involves the following three ties:\n(1) NAVD88 Level Tie (2) NAD 83 GPS Tie (3) NAVD88 GPS Tie\n3.1. Level Connections\n3.1.1. NAVD88 Level Tie\nAt all water level stations, a valid level tie to at least two Geodetic Bench Marks (GBM) is required on each set of levels, where appropriate marks are available within 1.6 KM (1 mi) leveling distance of the station location. A GBM is defined as a bench mark that exists, is useable, is available in the NGS database, has a Permanent ID (PID), and has a NAVD 88 elevation published on the datasheet. At many NWLON stations, the Primary Bench Mark (PBM) is a GBM. At the majority of NWLON stations, there are two or more tidal bench marks that are also GBM, thus increasing the chance that the geodetic level tie will be valid.\n\nUser's Guide for GPS Observations, Updated March 2007\n\nPage 3\n\n\fMake a Second-Order, Class I tie for all NWLON stations in the conterminous United States and Caribbean Islands. A Third-Order tie is used for all NWLON stations in Alaska, Hawaii, and Pacific Island areas.\nAt stations supporting hydro or other special projects, the tie shall be consistent with the accuracy of the levels required for the project.\nInformation on performing a valid level tie is provided in the Federal Geodetic Control Committee (FGCC) Standards and Specifications for Geodetic Control Networks, listed at the following website: http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/FGCS/tech_pub/1984-stds-specs-geodetic-control-networks.htm#3.5\nAlso, Section 3.4 of \"User's Guide for the Installation of Bench Marks and Leveling Requirements for Water Level Stations, October 1987\" provides information regarding how to perform a valid level tie.\nThe Second-Order, Class I tie is a requirement for digital levels to be accepted into the NGS database. Short level runs to the sensor, PBM, and two marks are excluded from this requirement since they are usually meant to verify sensor stability only. Since a level connection to GBMs with dynamic heights defines the International Great Lakes Datum of 1985 (IGLD 85) datum offset at each station in the Great Lakes, a valid connection to at least two GBMs is required at each site.\nA note shall be made in the remarks of the leveling section of the Site Report that a valid tie was achieved or not achieved. If a valid tie is not achieved, an explanation shall be provided and/or recommendations made for making a valid tie in the future.\nIf the NWLON water level station does not have two or more GBMs within 1.6 km (1 mi) leveling distance of the station location, then the level tie requirement is waived.\n3.1.2. Leveling at Continuously Operating Reference Stations (CORS)\nFor any NGS CORS reference bench mark that is located within 1.6 km (1 mi) leveling distance of a water level station Data Collection Platform (DCP), a leveling connection shall be made to the tidal bench marks in the water level station network every two years.\nInformation about NGS CORS can be obtained at http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/CORS/.\nAs of 2007, there are a limited number of water level stations in this category, but NGS and COOPS are attempting to secure funding to establish additional co-located sites to support longterm sea level trends monitoring.\n\nUser's Guide for GPS Observations, Updated March 2007\n\nPage 4\n\n\f3.2. GPS Connections\n3.2.1. References\nStatic GPS observations shall be performed at water level stations in accordance with \"NOAA Technical Memorandum \"NOS NGS-58, Guidelines for Establishing GPS-Derived Ellipsoid Heights (Standards 2 cm and 5 cm), Version 4.3\". These guidelines are written for establishing GPS derived ellipsoid height accuracy standards of 2 cm for all NWLON, PORTS\u00ae, hydrographic/Photogrammetry survey projects, COASTAL projects, and special project applications.\n3.2.2. GPS Observations - Goals and Planning\nPrecise positioning of NWLON stations in a global geocentric reference framework is needed to support NOS marine safe navigation and height modernization projects, in addition to monitoring vertical crustal motions for absolute sea level and global climate change studies.\nCO-OPS shall initiate a program of making periodic GPS observations at water level stations, as resources permit. CO-OPS activities shall be coordinated with NGS activities for best use of available resources.\nGPS technology and procedures shall be implemented in the operational plan:\n(1) To support the development of a seamless, geocentric reference system for the acquisition, management, and archiving of NOS water level data. This will provide a national and global digital database, which will comply with the minimum geo-spatial metadata standards of the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI) and connect the NOS water level datums to the NGS NSRS;\n(2) To establish transformation functions between NOS chart datum Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW) or Low Water Datum (LWD) in the Great Lakes, and the geocentric reference system to support NOS 3-dimensional hydrographic surveys, the implementation of Electronic Chart Display and Information Systems (ECDIS), and the NOS Vertical Datum transformation (VDatum tool) and tidal datum models. Integration of GPS procedures will support the development of tidally-controlled Digital Elevation Maps and Models for use in programs such as marsh restoration.\n(3) To support water level datum transfers by using GPS derived orthometric heights.\n(4) To monitor crustal motions (horizontal and vertical) to support global climate change investigations.\n\nUser's Guide for GPS Observations, Updated March 2007\n\nPage 5\n\n\fThe GPS surveys should be scheduled during routine annual maintenance trips to NWLON or PORTS\u00ae stations and during the installation of secondary and tertiary water level stations to support the survey projects, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) projects, COASTAL project stations, tsunami stations, and special purpose surveys. CO-OPS shall continue to coordinate the GPS occupation of water level network bench marks with NGS, USACE, and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), as appropriate.\nGPS-derived orthometric heights can be accurately determined and used for water level datum transfers according to the following criteria: (a) use the established guidelines for 3-D precise relative positioning to measure ellipsoid heights; (b) properly connect to several NAVD 88 bench marks; and (c) use the latest high-resolution modeled geoid heights for the area of interest. In many remote locations, the use of GPS-derived orthometric heights for datum transfer will be more efficient (timely) and more cost-effective than the use of conventional differential surveying techniques and may, under certain circumstances, preclude the installation of additional water level stations to establish a datum.\nAs specified in the Annual Project Instructions, Annual Station Specific Requirements, or in the contract documents, installer shall be required to perform GPS observations at each water level station at specified intervals over time, depending on the rate of sea level rise in that water area of the coast.\nAs of March 2007, 20 NWLON stations have been identified where annual GPS observations are required because of the sea level rise in those areas. These 20 NWLON stations \u00ad 8 in Alaska and 12 in the Gulf of Mexico \u00ad will be identified in the annual Project Instructions. The rest of the NWLON stations require GPS observations every five years. These guidelines will be updated as GPS technology improves and the policy or regulations change in the future.\n3.2.3. Static Surveys\nStatic GPS surveys shall be conducted on a minimum of one bench mark at each water level station, according to the priority levels below. Generally, one mark at each station is designated as the GPS mark and observations shall be made to that mark (as per the required GPS observation frequency) unless otherwise specified in the Station Specific Requirements.\n1. National Water Level Observation Network (NWLON), PORTS\u00ae, and tsunami stations. 2. Long term operating secondary water level stations. 3. New tertiary survey, COASTAL stations, and special project stations. 4. Historical subordinate water level stations with an accepted MLLW value on the current official tidal datum epoch\nStatic GPS surveys shall be conducted at water level stations periodically over time to establish a history of relationship between the tidal or water level datums, and the ellipsoid.\n\nUser's Guide for GPS Observations, Updated March 2007\n\nPage 6\n\n\f3.2.4. Criteria for Bench Mark Selection for GPS Observations\nThe GPS Water Level Station Bench Mark (GPSBM) shall be selected based on the following criteria: (a) permanence or stability; (b) historic GPS use; (c) satellite visibility; and (d) safety and convenience.\n(a) Permanence or Stability of Bench Marks\nNGS has defined the following monumentation quality codes, also called the stability codes, for various bench mark settings.\nStability code A \u00ad monuments of the most reliable nature which may be expected to hold their elevations very well; e.g. Class A rod marks, or marks installed on large boulders/rock outcrop.\nStability code B \u00ad monuments which probably hold their elevations well; e.g. Class B rod marks, or marks installed on large concrete footings/foundations.\nStability code C \u00ad monuments which may hold their elevations but which are commonly subject to surface ground movements; e.g. pavement or concrete monuments.\nStability code D \u00ad movements of questionable or unknown reliability.\nThe station bench mark selected for GPS observations shall be of stability code A or B. GPS observations on the PBM are preferred if the PBM is either stability code A or B, and is suitable for satellite observations. Stability code C and D bench marks shall not be used for GPS observations, unless NGS has previously made GPS observations on those marks.\n(b) Historic GPS Use\nIn many states, CO-OPS has provided NGS with lists of selected marks suitable for GPS observations at water level stations, and NGS has completed observations on these marks. Some tidal marks designated as Federal Base Network (FBN) or Cooperative Base Network (CBN) marks may be of stability code C. Generally once a mark is selected for GPS observations, future GPS observations shall be done on the same mark. If leveling reveals instability of the mark over time, select another mark.\nPriority shall be given to a GBM for GPS observations because the GBM already has a NSRS height (NAVD 88). The GBM considered here is one of the 10 tidal or water level bench marks at a NWLON water level station, or one of the 5 bench marks for survey or special projects.\n\nUser's Guide for GPS Observations, Updated March 2007\n\nPage 7\n\n\f(c) Satellite Visibility\nThe most desirable bench mark for GPS observations should have 360 degrees clearance around the mark at 10 degrees and greater above the horizon. Newly established marks shall be set in locations that have these clearances, if at all possible. If a station does not have any marks suitable for GPS observations, and it has been selected as needing GPS observations, a new 3-D rod mark shall be established. This new mark shall be connected to the station bench mark network through conventional geodetic leveling, and then GPS observations shall be made.\nAll existing station bench marks at operating stations shall be assessed for feasibility of GPS observations, as time and resources permit. A note shall be made, either in the APP field of the electronic leveling HA file or on a copy of the published bench mark sheet, stating the suitability of GPS observations for each mark. The GPS visibility obstruction diagram as shown in Figure 5 under Section 6 GPS Project Documentation shall also be completed for each mark observed.\n(d) Safety and Convenience\nThe location of the GPS bench mark should be safe, secure, and convenient. Bench mark locations which allow unattended GPS data collection are desirable as the field crew can multitask at the same time as collecting the GPS data. The safety of the GPS equipment (vandalism proof) should be considered in the mark selection process.\nThe bench mark selected for GPS observations should be located on public property rather than on private property, as permissions from private owners may be required in the future to access the bench mark and for collecting the GPS data. The distance from the station DCP should also be convenient.\n3.2.5. Planning, Position, and Photograph of the GPS Bench Mark\nRegarding suitability of a mark for GPS observations, a review should be made first of the historical bench mark information in the station files and level records, if access to that information via database is available, or if the information is available. Stable marks from the level records are identified and copies of the descriptions and sketches are made. Descriptions and sketches are examined and marks are eliminated that have obvious obstructions, such as vertical marks, marks set several meters from medium to large structures, etc. Do not eliminate marks that are near poles, fences or about 20 meters from small structures at this time during the preliminary planning. If no other mark is available or found suitable, and time does not permit the installation of a new (GPS) mark, it may be necessary to use one of these marks. In selecting a GPS mark, priority should be given to the NWLON PBM or an NGS, NSRS, mark with a First or Second-Order NAVD 88 height on a NGS datasheet.\n\nUser's Guide for GPS Observations, Updated March 2007\n\nPage 8\n\n\fIf time permits, conduct a site reconnaissance survey prior to starting the GPS sessions, to select the proper mark(s) to occupy with GPS. A site survey consists of preparing an obstruction diagram for each useable mark using an inclinometer and placing a GPS unit (hand-held or better) over the bench mark to determine how many satellites can be tracked at that location. Determine the location of a suitable weather proof location, if any, for the GPS receiver. Measure the distance from the mark to this location to determine the antenna cable length required. Ideal marks should have approximately 360 degree unobstructed visibility above the 10 degree elevation mask. However, satellite geometry changes with time, so for 4-hour tracking sessions some obstructions, particularly those to the north of the mark, may not degrade the precision or accuracy of the final solution.\nGPS (horizontal) positions (latitude and longitude) of each bench mark installed or recovered shall be listed on the HA files for laser levels, if used, or on the bench mark descriptions sheet for optical leveling, as applicable, at each subordinate water level station occupied for all projects.\nDigital photographs shall be taken of all station bench mark disks in accordance with Reference 5 - Attachment R, Requirements for Digital Photographs of Survey Control, NGS, July 2005\". A minimum of three photos shall be taken: close-up of the disk face; waist or chest level view of disk and setting; and horizontal view of location and direction of view. All digital station photo files should be named such that the name of the file will indicate the station number and the type of photo taken. For example, the bench mark A face photo for San Francisco water level station shall be named as 94142901 BM A face photo .jpg.\nA digital photo of the stamping of the bench mark occupied must be made as shown in Figure 7. If a digital photo is not available, then a rubbing of the bench mark must be done as shown in Figure 6. A digital photo of the stamping is preferred over rubbing of the mark.\n3.2.6. Data Collection and setup\nSet the epoch update or recording interval (REC INT) for 15-seconds, which should agree with the recording interval of the reference stations (IGS or CORS) used to post-process the data. For GPS sessions greater than 30 minutes, collect data at 15-second epoch intervals, starting at an even minute. The elevation mask (ELEV MASK) is typically set for 10 degrees for static surveys; low angle satellites can degrade the final solution. Set the minimum number of satellites to four. For static surveying, setting the minimum number of satellites (MIN SV) is not as critical as for kinematic surveying. However, if the number of satellites tracked drops below four, it could be an indication of other problems, such as an antenna or antenna cable connection problem, RF interference, or an obstruction from traffic (vehicle or vessel). The GPS signal from the satellite is not very strong when entering the receiver, so anything that produces further attenuation of the signal can cause the receiver to stop tracking satellites.\n\nUser's Guide for GPS Observations, Updated March 2007\n\nPage 9\n\n\fAlways collect a little bit of extra data if time and schedule permit, so that blunders or invalid data, if any, can be removed during processing still leaving required minimum number of hours of valid data for one GPS session.\nIt is recommended that after each session is complete, two independent downloads be done from the GPS receiver to the laptop computer, so that if one downloaded file gets corrupted, the other file may have good data. Since two downloads of the GPS observation file is a requirement, do not make copy of the downloaded file twice to the laptop instead, as both the files will have the same problem, if there exists a problem. Send both copies of digital GPS data so that one copy of the data can be forwarded to NGS and other copy will be kept for record in CO-OPS' Requirements and Development Division's Operational Engineering Team (RDD/OET).\nData should be compressed and copied to a CD-ROM, diskette, and/or zip disk, as appropriate, at the end of each GPS day for transporting data from the field to the office, or hotel as the case may be, for processing. If data are logged to a PCMCIA card (flash card) in the receiver, consult the receiver User Reference Guide about re-formatting the card prior to beginning observations.\nData should be collected during periods when the Vertical Dilution of Precision (VDOP) is less than 6 for at least 90% of each 30-minute or longer GPS observations, if VDOP maps or data are available for the site.\n3.2.7. North American Datum 1983 (NAD83) GPS Tie\nAt each NWLON station, GPS observations shall be performed as listed in the Annual Project Instructions, Annual Station Specific Requirements, and contract documents. The frequency of repeated observations on the GPSSBM shall be determined based upon the rate of sea level rise and general stability of bench marks in the local leveling network.\nThe NGS OPUS is now used extensively for quick and convenient processing of the GPS raw data for a variety of applications. The position solution provided by OPUS is considered preliminary data and is not retained by NGS. Further information on using OPUS is provided later in this document.\nThe expected ellipsoid height accuracy for a 4 hour OPUS solution is 1.8 cm, (at the 67% confidence level), and that is desirable, practical, and achievable with the requirements as specified in reference #2, NOAA Technical Memorandum \"NOS NGS-58, Guidelines for Establishing GPS-Derived Ellipsoid Heights (Standards 2 cm and 5 cm), Version 4.3.\nThe length of GPS observation sessions depends upon the length of time the field crew has available for GPS observations, security of the equipment, number of satellites available at a site, number of GPS receivers available for GPS observations, etc.\n\nUser's Guide for GPS Observations, Updated March 2007\n\nPage 10\n\n\fFor all water level stations, collect a minimum of 4 hours of GPS data on the GPSBM. Extra care shall be taken to ensure that the antenna height is precisely recorded, and that the antenna setup is stable. A continuous long session (at least 4 hours long but less than 24 hours) repeated annually is preferred to two or more shorter sessions (of less than 4 hours each) repeated on the same visit, providing better data for OPUS and more independent observations.\nAfter the data collection session is complete, two independent downloads are required from the GPS receiver to the laptop computer. If one downloaded file gets corrupted, the other file may have good data. Do not make a copy of the downloaded file, as both the files will have the same problem, if there is a problem. Follow the NGS guidelines for naming these files. Submit both copies of the digital GPS data along with the necessary documentation as specified below.\n3.2.8. GPS Data Processing Using OPUS\nField parties shall use OPUS for processing the raw GPS observations. OPUS provides an easily accessible, rapid method for submitting GPS data and receiving an almost instantaneous solution response from NGS via email.\nThe NGS OPUS web page can be obtained at http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/OPUS/. The following information is found on the OPUS web page but is also presented here for convenience of the reader.\nOPUS allows users to submit their GPS data files to NGS, where the data will be processed to determine a position using NGS computers and software. Each data file that is submitted will be processed with respect to three CORS sites. The sites selected may not be the nearest to your site but are selected by distance, number of observations, site stability, etc. The position for your data will be reported back to you via email in both - ITRF and NAD 83 coordinates as well as Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM), U. S. National Grid (USNG) and State Plane Coordinates (SPC) northing and easting.\nOPUS is completely automatic and requires only a minimal amount of information from the user, such as:\n(a) The email address where you want the results sent (b) The data file that you want to process (which you may select using the browse feature; raw or RINEX accepted) (c) The antenna type used to collect this data file (selected from a list of calibrated GPS antennas) (d) The height of the Antenna Reference Point (ARP) above the monument or mark that you are positioning.\nOnce this information is complete, you then click the Upload button to send your data to NGS.\n\nUser's Guide for GPS Observations, Updated March 2007\n\nPage 11\n\n\fYour results will be emailed to you, usually within a few minutes. You may upload multiple data files in a zip archive if you wish. However, be careful, the options that you choose will be applied to all of the data files in that archive (i.e. the same antenna type, ARP height will be used for all of the files in the zip file).\nThe following are some simple guidelines for analyzing the OPUS solutions.\n(a) Make sure the antenna type and the ARP height are correct. (b) Review the solution statistics:\n(I) A good quality OPUS run should typically use 90% or more of your observations. (II) OPUS should have fixed at least 80% of the ambiguities (III) The overall RMS should seldom exceed 3 cm. (IV) The maximum peak to peak errors should be less than 2 cm for horizontal and 4 cm for vertical (This depends, of course, on the accuracy you are trying to achieve.)\nNGS needs to receive orbit data from IGS in order to obtain a solution. If the data is submitted too quickly (before NGS gets the orbit data from IGS), the submitter may need to re-submit the data at a later time. For best results, submit the GPS data to OPUS at least 17 hours after the first midnight (in Greenwich Mean Time) following the time when the observations were recorded. Compare the resultant solution to the last previous solution made at the station, if available, to ensure that you do not have a blunder in the antenna setup. This will be revealed by a noticeable discrepancy in the ellipsoid height. Include a copy of the solution in the station inspection documentation package submitted to RDD/OET, as well as to NGS GPS data sets.\n3.2.9. OPUS DB Preliminary information\nPending NGS support, OPUS DB will be released by NGS in the near future. This advanced version of OPUS will submit solutions directly to the NGS database for publication as part of NSRS if all required documentation is provided by the submitter. Further guidance will be provided once OPUS DB is released and this document will be updated as appropriate. Any data sets submitted to OPUS will be subsequently re-submitted by RDD/OET to OPUS DB to ensure the data is published by NGS, provided all the proper and required GPS data and documentation (as listed below under data submission section) has been submitted to CO-OPS.\nHeight modernization guidelines are listed at the following url: http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/heightmod/guidelines.shtml\nThe Opus DB datasheet concept is fully listed at the following NGS web site: http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/PROJECTS/draft/OPUS/OPUS-DB-concept.htm\n\nUser's Guide for GPS Observations, Updated March 2007\n\nPage 12\n\n\fThe following tables identify the required data elements and optional data elements for OPUS DB respectively.\n\nREQUIRED DATA ELEMENTS (15 each):\n\nELEMENT\n\nRATIONALE\n\ne-mail\n\nFor identification & correspondence.\n\nFilename\n\nNecessary to compute position.\n\nAntenna\n\nNecessary to compute position.\n\nantenna height\n\nNecessary to compute position.\n\nname of submitting agency\n\nIdentifies the observer.\n\npermanent identifier (PID)\n\nIdentifies the station.\n\nDesignation\n\nIdentifies the station.\n\ndescriptive text\n\nAids in station recovery.\n\nRod/pipe depth & units\n\nDescribes monumentation quality.\n\nsleeve depth & units\n\nDescribes monumentation quality.\n\nsetting code & specific setting text\n\nDescribes monumentation quality.\n\nphotograph (of marker)\n\nAids in station recovery.\n\nOPTIONAL DATA ELEMENTS (11 each):\n\nELEMENT\n\nRATIONALE\n\nphotographs Equipment photos describe antenna height and equipment used.

These requirements will be active once OPUS DB is designated operational by NGS. Out of the 15 Required Data Elements, 13 are applicable to all the marks and the remaining two - rod/pipe depth & units and sleeve depth & units \u00ad are applicable only to rod marks.\n\n3.2.10. NAVD 88 GPS Tie\n\nThe NAVD 88 GPS Tie involves simultaneous GPS observations at the GPSBM and one or more GBMs located up to 10 KM (6.26 mi) from the GPSBM. This \"Height Mod\" tie is deferred until such time as NGS enables user-friendly blue-booking of campaign data (OPUS projects).\n\n4.0 GPS Project Documentation and Data Submission\n\nThe following information in addition to the results obtained from OPUS shall be submitted to CO-OPS at the end of the project (see the time frames for submission of GPS data later in Section 4.1) so that proper information can be forwarded to NGS for blue-booking purposes.\n\nThis documentation is important because most of the information is used to submit the GPS data to NGS. In addition to the log, data must comply with the \"Data Submission to NGS Section\" of NGS-58 (Reference 2) and the \"Input Formats and Specifications of the National Geodetic Survey (NGS) Data Base\" (Reference 4) to become part of the NSRS.\n\nGPS data collected by contractors or NOAA Ships for hydrographic survey support, or special projects shall be processed by the parties, and final data product - Receiver Independent Exchange Format (RINEX) data and appropriate forms - shall be submitted to CO-OPS which will be forwarded to NGS, as per the contracts, project instructions, statement of work, or as appropriate.\n\nGPS forms in PDF format can be found at the following NGS Federal Base Network (FBN) web site:\n\nhttp://www.ngs.noaa.gov/PROJECTS/FBN/index.htm\n\nRefer to Figures 1 through 7 for GPS projects submission checklist and sample package contents.

Data Submission\nAll required GPS data and documentation shall be submitted to CO-OPS within 15 business days of the GPS observations or the removal of the gauge whichever is earlier.\nAll GPS data and documentation shall be submitted in paper format and in digital format such as CD-ROM in duplicate, so that one copy stays with CO-OPS and other copy is forwarded to NGS. For GPS data that are collected according to the contracts, there may be additional requirements for submission, please check with the appropriate Contracting Officer's Representatives.\nSubmit all GPS project data and documentation to:\nChief, Requirements and Development Division CO-OPS, N/OPS1, SSMC 4 1305 East-West Highway, Station 6531 Silver Spring, MD 20910-3233 Tel: 301-713-2897\n\nUser's Guide for GPS Observations, Updated March 2007\n\nPage 15\n\n\fFigure 1 GPS PROJECT SUBMISSION CHECKLIST\nProject Title : _____________________________________________________________ Submitting Agency: _________________________________________________________ Observing Agency: _________________________________________________________ Receiver Type: ____________________________________________________________ Antenna Type: ____________________________________________________________\nPACKAGE CONTENTS\n( ) Project Report ( ) Station Description or Recovery notes ( ) Observations Log Sheets\nData which must be filled out: Station Designation, Date (UTC), General Location, Day of Year, Project Name, Session ID, Observation Session Times, Agency Full Name, Operator Full Name, Phone Number, GPS Receiver, GPS Antenna, Antenna Height, Data File Name ( ) Antenna height measurements ( ) Station Visibility Diagrams ( ) Photographs or Rubbings of Station Marks ( ) Raw GPS data ( ) Rinex GPS Data - See below ( ) OPUS Results ( ) Other\n\nUser's Guide for GPS Observations, Updated March 2007\n\nPage 16\n\n\fDATA REFORMATTING\nConvert the raw GPS data to RINEX2 format with your manufacturer's software.

ITRF to NAD 83 transformation parameters\n\n\fGUIDELINES FOR ESTABLISHING GPS-DERIVED ELLIPSOID HEIGHTS [Standards: 2 cm and 5 cm] Version 4.3\nPreface:\nThe following guidelines were developed by the National Geodetic Survey (NGS) for performing Global Positioning System (GPS) surveys that are intended to achieve ellipsoid height network accuracies of 5 cm at the 95 percent confidence level, as well as ellipsoid height local accuracies of 2 cm and 5 cm, also at the 95 percent confidence level. See Appendix A for information about local and relative accuracies. These guidelines were developed in a partnership with Federal, state, and local government agencies, academia, and private surveyors and are the result of processing various test data sets and having extensive discussions with various GPS users groups.\nWe are confident that these guidelines, if followed, will result in achieving the intended accuracy. Additional tests may show that some of these guidelines can be relaxed. These guidelines are intended for establishing geometric vertical control networks.\nThese guidelines will be expanded in the future to include the establishment of GPS-derived orthometric heights that approach these same accuracies, 2 cm and 5 cm. The slight differences between the accuracies of GPS-derived ellipsoid heights and GPS-derived orthometric heights will be generally due to the accuracy of the geoid model and published orthometric heights used to evaluate the differences between the three height systems, i.e., ellipsoid, geoid, and orthometric heights.\nNote: these guidelines assume that for the survey project area in question, NGS has completed the establishment of a high accuracy reference network at 100-kilometer spacing or that a state-wide High Accuracy Reference Network (HARN) has been established, i.e., there are A- or B-order stations distributed throughout the state at an approximate spacing of 50 km or else there are Federal HARN stations or GPS Continuously Operating Reference Station (CORS) sites located within 75 km of the project area.\nAn effort should be made to connect to stations which were previously determined using these guidelines (or equivalent).\n\n\fIntroduction:\nAccurate connections to the control stations cited in the Observations section on the next page must be made in the International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF) coordinate system. (See Appendix C for more information on ITRF.) This is accomplished by simultaneous observations between selected A-order (5 mm + 1:10,000,000 accuracy standards) stations of the International GPS Service for Geodynamics (IGS) and/or NGS CORS or NGS-approved CORS within about 75 km of the project. NGS-approved CORS are those which NGS has positioned or approved with respect to the ITRF/NAD 83 coordinate systems. If there are none available, B-order (8 mm + 1:1,000,000 accuracy standards) stations within about 75 km of the project may be substituted. However, it must be noted that the use of some of the B-order stations may mean that the network accuracy of +/- 5 cm will not be achieved.\nThese IGS stations and CORS sites are located throughout the United States. The IGS stations or CORS sites located closest to the project must be used. The following commands are used to access the NGS CORS system:\nFtp cors.ngs.noaa.gov login: anonymous Password: your complete e-mail address\nThe same files are accessible with Web browers (i.e., Mosaic, Netscape, Internet Explorer). The NGS home page is at http://www.ngs.noaa.gov\n\"Information about A- and B-order stations is given on five sets of CD-ROMs covering the United States.\" The particular CD-ROM that covers the project area in question can be obtained by contacting NGS' Information Services Branch, 1315 East-West Highway, Silver Spring, Maryland 20910, (301) 713-3242 (voice), (301) 713-4172 (Fax). A limited amount of this information, i.e., the 100 closest stations of any type, can be retrieved from the NGS world wide web site. The electronic bulletin board system and/or web site usually contain new stations that have been added after the CD-ROM was produced.\nAnalysis of the quality of project data shall be based on repeatability of measurements, adjustment residuals, and analysis of loop misclosures. Please be aware that repeatability and loop misclosures do not disclose all problems.\n\n\fObservations:\nThe following requirements are for both 2-centimeter and 5-centimeter standards, unless otherwise stated.\n1. Dual-frequency, full-wavelength GPS receivers are required for base lines greater than 10 km and are the preferred type of GPS receiver for all observations, regardless of base-line distance. Geodetic-quality antennas with ground planes are required. Whenever possible, antennas used during a project should be identical; otherwise corrections must be made for antenna phase patterns. Different makes and models of antennas have different antenna phase patterns. If antenna phase patterns are not accounted for, mixing different antennas in a project can cause vertical discrepancies of as much as 10 cm. Some manufacturers are including software packages which correct for the use of different antennas. (It should be noted that choke ring antennas help reduce the effect of multipath and are highly recommended.)\nThe manufacturer, model, and complete serial numbers of all receivers and antennas must be included on each station Session Observation Log.\n2. The survey shall be referenced to at least three existing National Spatial Reference System A- or B-order three-dimensional control stations near the project area. The survey will also consist of at least three primary base stations that are referenced to the three control stations and interspersed throughout the project. The survey will also include secondary base stations and local network stations to meet the spacing requirements in item 5., below. Primary and secondary base stations can be newly established stations in this project.\nA sample project with observing scheme is depicted in figure 1 located at the end of the section. A summary of the guidelines is provided in table 1 located at the end of the vector processing section. See Appendix A for more information about control, base, and local network stations.\n3. For control stations and primary base stations, receivers shall collect data continuously and simultaneously for at least three, 5-hour sessions on 3 different days during the project.\n4. Observation periods for stations other than control stations and primary base stations are as follows:\na. For the 2-Centimeter Standard: Each base line (adjacent station pair) must be occupied for a minimum of 30 minutes per session.\nb. For the 5-Centimeter Standard: Observations between primary and secondary base stations must be for a minimum of 30 minutes per session. While there is no minimum observation time for local network stations, each base line (adjacent station pair) must be occupied long enough in each session to ensure that all integers are fixed and the RMS for the base line solution does not exceed 1.5 cm.\n5. The observing scheme is based on the GPS survey of marks spaced as indicated below for 2- and 5-centimeter standards. Stations in the scheme\n\n\fare noted as either control, primary base station, secondary base station, or local network stations. (The observing scheme chosen for a sample project is depicted in figure 1, page 7.)\n\nFor the 2-Centimeter Standard: Spacing between local network stations cannot exceed 10 km; the average spacing must be less than or equal to 7 km. Spacing between primary base stations cannot exceed 40 km and spacing between primary and secondary base stations cannot exceed 15 km.\n\nFor the 5-Centimeter Standard: Spacing between local network stations cannot exceed 20 km; the average spacing must be less than or equal to 10 km. Spacing between primary base stations cannot exceed 50 km and spacing between primary and secondary base stations cannot exceed 20 km. (Note that secondary base stations may not be required in projects of small areal extent. See Item 2. above.)\n\n6. The observing scheme for all primary base stations requires that each primary base station must be connected to at least its nearest primary base station neighbor and nearest control station according to the observing procedures stated in item 3., above. Primary base stations must be traceable back to two control stations along independent paths.\n\nIn addition to this requirement for primary base stations, the observing scheme for all base stations (primary and secondary) requires that each base station be connected with at least its two nearest primary or secondary base station neighbors according to observing procedures stated in item 4., above. For secondary base stations, one of these connections must be to its nearest primary base station neighbor. Secondary base stations must be traceable back to two primary base stations along independent paths.\n\nLocal network stations must be traceable back to two base stations along independent paths.\n\nThe observing scheme for all stations requires that all adjacent stations (base lines) be observed at least twice on 2 different days and at two different times of the day according to observing procedures shown in item 4. on the previous page. The purpose is to ensure different atmospheric conditions (different days) and significantly different satellite geometry (different times) for the two base line measurements.\n\nObservations on the second day should be completed between 27 and 33 hours after the completion of the first day's observations if the first day's observations were begun prior to 12:00 noon. Or, the observations should be completed between 15 and 21 hours after the completion of the first day's observations if the first day's observations were begun after 12:00 noon. This is necessary since the satellite constellation geometry repeats itself every 12 hours.\n\nExamples:\n\nFirst-day observations Begun during: 8:00 a.m. to 8:30 a.m. 10:30 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. 1:00 p.m. to 1:30 p.m. 3:30 p.m. to 4:00 p.m.\n\nSecond-day observations Completed anytime between: 11:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. 2:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m. 4:30 a.m. and 10:00 a.m. 7:00 a.m. and 12:30 p.m.\n\n\f(Note that the second day of observations does not need to follow immediately after the first day. Satellite geometry moves ahead, or precesses, 4 minutes per day. If the second observations are not performed within 1 week of the first, this daily 4-minute change must be accounted for when meeting the different satellite geometry requirement.)\n7. Selection of primary and secondary base stations in order of most-to-least- preferred are: 1. High Precision Geodetic Network (HPGN)/HARN (either Federal Base Network (FBN) or Cooperative Base Network (CBN) stations which have level ties to bench marks of A- or B-stability quality during this project; 2. bench marks of A- or B-stability quality or HPGN/HARN stations which were previously tied to bench marks of A- or B-stability quality; 3. User Densification Network (UDN)stations which have level ties made during this project; or 4. bench marks of C stability quality. In areas of known or suspected subsidence or uplift, special guidelines may need to be followed.\n8. Data should be collected during periods when the Vertical Dilution of Precision (VDOP) is less than 6 for at least 90 percent of each 30-minute, or longer, observing period. For shorter observing periods, as in some projects where the 5-centimeter standard is the goal, a VDOP greater than 6 should be avoided entirely. Travel between stations could be scheduled during large VDOP periods.\n9. For sessions greater than 30 minutes, collect data at 15-second epoch intervals, starting at an even minute. For sessions less than 30 minutes, collect data at 5-second intervals.\n10. Track satellites down to at least a 10-degree elevation angle. (Note that tracking below 15 degrees may be helpful during processing when collecting data for less than 30 minutes.)\n11. If possible, coordinate observations with local, existing CORS which are collecting phase data with dual-frequency receivers.\n12. Meteorological data must be collected at the control stations and primary and secondary base stations. Weather data consist of wet- and dry-bulb temperatures (or dry-bulb temperature and relative humidity) and atmospheric pressure. For sessions greater than 2 hours, record weather data at the beginning, middle, and end of each session. For sessions that are less than 2 hours in length, but more than 30 minutes, record weather data at the beginning and end of each session. For sessions that are less than 30 minutes in length, collect data at the mid-point of the session. Meteorological data shall also be collected immediately after an obvious weather front passes during a session and also immediately before it passes, if possible. Atmospheric pressure measurements must be made at approximately the same height as the GPS antenna phase center. Record on the observing log the time and where the weather data were gathered, and any abnormal weather conditions.\n(Note that even though all of these data may not used in the vector processing, they may be helpful during the analysis of the results and in future reprocessing with more robust software.)\n\n\fBefore taking weather observations, the meteorological instruments should be allowed ample time (approximately 10 minutes) to stabilize to ambient conditions. Observations of wet- and dry-bulb temperatures must be observed and recorded to at least the nearest 1 degree Celsius. Barometric readings must be observed and recorded to at least the nearest 1 millibar. Meteorological data should be collected at or near the antenna phase center. All equipment must be checked for proper calibration.\n13. Antenna set-up is critical to the success of the project. Plumbing bubbles on the antenna pole of the fixed-height tripod must be shaded when plumbing is performed. Plumbing bubbles must be shaded for at least 3 minutes before checking and/or re-plumbing. The perpendicularity of the poles must be checked at the beginning of the project and any other time there is suspicion of a problem.\nFor the 2-Centimeter Standard: Fixed-height tripods are required for all receivers.\nFor the 5-Centimeter Standard: Fixed-height tripods are preferred for all receivers. When a fixed-height tripod is not used, the height of the antenna must be carefully measured to prevent station set-up blunders. Tribrachs used for these set-ups must be checked and adjusted when necessary. Totally independent measurements of the antenna height above mark in both metric units and English units must be made before and after each session. Someone other than the observer must check the measurement computations by carefully comparing measurements and then entering his/her initials on the log.\n14. A rubbing of the mark must be made at each occupation of a station. When not feasible to make the required rubbing, a plan sketch of the mark must be substituted, accurately recording all markings.\n\n\fControl Station 1 Primary Base 1\n\nControl Station 2 Primary Base 3\n\nLNS 1\n\nLNS 12\n\nLNS 2\n\nLNS 11\n\nLNS 3\n\nLNS 10\n\nSecondary Base 1\n\nSecondary Base 2\n\nLNS 4\n\nLNS 9\n\nLNS 5\n\nLNS 8\n\nLNS 6\n\nLNS 7 Primary Base 2\n\nControl Station 3\n\n6 Receivers 3 Control Stations (CS) 3 Primary Base Stations (PBS) 2 Secondary Base Stations (SBS) 12 Local Network Stations (LNS)\n\n**********\n\nOne Week of\nObservations\n\n(1 hour travel time)\n\nCS1, CS2, CS3, PBS1, PBS2, PBS3\n\nDays 1,2, and 3 5-hour sessions (8 a.m.- 1 p.m.)\n\nPBS1, LNS1, LNS2, LNS3, SBS1, LNS4\n\nDay 4 30-minute session (8 am - 8:30 am)\n\nSBS1, LNS4, LNS5, LNS6, PBS2, LNS7\n\nDay 4 30-minute session (9:30 am - 10 am)\n\nPBS2, LNS7, LNS8, LNS9, PBS3, LNS10\n\nDay 4 30-minute session (11 am - 11:30am)\n\nPBS3, LNS10, LNS11, LNS12, SBS2, PBS1 Day 4 30-minute session (12:30 pm - 1 pm)\n\nPBS1, LNS1, LNS2, LNS3, SBS1, LNS4\n\nDay 5 30-minute session (12 pm - 12:30 am)\n\nSBS1, LNS4, LNS5, LNS6, PBS2, LNS7\n\nDay 5 30-minute session (1:30 pm - 2 pm)\n\nPBS2, LNS7, LNS8, LNS9, PBS3, LNS10\n\nDay 5 30-minute session (3 pm - 3:30 pm)\n\nPBS3, LNS10, LNS11, LNS12, SBS2, PBS1 Day 5 30-minute session (4:30 pm - 5 pm)\n\nFigure 1.--Sample project observing scheme.\n\n\fVector Processing:\nThe following requirements are for both 2-centimeter and 5-centimeter standards unless otherwise stated. A summary of the guidelines is listed in table 1 at the end of this section.\n1. Final vector processing and quality review of collected data shall be accomplished using NGS' program OMNI or other interactive, graphics-producing software which produces results equivalent to OMNI. The vector between adjacent GPS-occupied stations shall be processed using the multi-station processing technique which includes double-difference phase corelations (or equivalent) with a selection of a reference station that minimizes vector lengths.\n2. Use precise ephemerides. NGS' precise ephemerides are available from the U.S. Coast Guard Bulletin Board System or the NGS world wide web site. The Coast Guard Bulletin Board System number is (703)313-5910 and the NGS web site address is http://www.ngs.noaa.gov The USCG web site address is http://www.navcen.uscg.mil/navcen.htm\n3. For sessions greater than 30 minutes, process data using 30-second epoch intervals. (Note that using a smaller epoch interval may improve ease of data processing.) For sessions less than 30 minutes, process data using 5-second epoch intervals.\n4. For sessions greater than 30 minutes, use only satellite data tracked above the 15-degree elevation angle. For sessions less than 30 minutes, use satellite data tracked above the 15-degree elevation angle; data collected below the 15 degree elevation angle should only be used if required to derive a successful solution.\n5. Final processing shall consist of fixing all integers for each vector for all sessions except to some control sites. For short base lines, under 10 km, the L1 fixed solution may be the best choice. For vectors greater than 40 km to control sites, a session may consist of a set of partially or completely fixed vectors and in the worst possible scenario may also include float solutions where no integers could be fixed.\nA model to account for tropospheric effects must be used. The project report must state which model was used. Measured meterological data should be used only when it has been determined that the instruments have been properly calibrated and the measurements accurately represent the current atmospheric conditions at the station. If standard meteorological data are used instead of actual measured values, the processing software must account for changes in standard default values due to the station's location and height above the vertical datum. For base lines greater than 15 kilometers or with \"large\" height differences, a relative tropospheric scale parameter should be solved for, along with the base line vector components.\n6. The quality of collected data shall be determined from the double-difference residual plots and RMS values. Final coordinates and their quality assessment shall be determined by using least-squares adjustment software and by analysis of repeated vectors and free-adjustment residuals and loop misclosures (most loops consisting of repeated vectors).\n\n\f7. RMS values for each computed base line (adjacent station pairs) must not exceed 1.5 cm.\n8. Reobservation criteria:\nFor the 2-Centimeter Standard: For local network requirements, must reobserve any base line (adjacent station pair) where the difference in ellipsoid height between the repeat observations exceeds 2.0 cm. For station pairs involving control stations, must reobserve any control station base line where the ellipsoid height difference between the repeat observations exceeds 5.0 cm.\nFor the 5-Centimeter Standard: Must reobserve any base line (adjacent station pair) or control station pair where the ellipsoid height difference between the repeat observations exceeds 5.0 cm.\nWhen reobserving base lines that exceed tolerance values, the new observation must agree with an old base line which was observed using the criteria in number 6. of the Observations section above, i.e., the two base line measurements must contain significantly different satellite geometry.\n\n\fTable 1. -- Summary of Guidelines.\n\nControl\n2 and 5 cm\n\nPrimary Base\n2 cm\n\nPrimary Secondary Secondary Local\n\nBase\n\nBase\n\nBase\n\nNetwork\n\n5 cm\n\n2 cm\n\n5 cm\n\n2 cm\n\nLocal Network\n5 cm\n\nDual Frequency\nRequired\n\nYes, if base\nline is greater than 10\nkm\n\nYes, if base\nline is greater than 10\nkm\n\nYes, if base\nline is greater than 10\nkm\n\nYes, if base line\nis greater than 10\nkm\n\nYes, if base line\nis greater than 10\nkm\n\nYes, if base\nline is greater than 10\nkm\n\nYes, if base\nline is greater than 10\nkm\n\nGeodetic\n\nQuality\n\nAntenna with Yes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nGround Plane\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nMin.

For base lines greater than 10 km, but less than 15 km, 1 hour sessions should meet the standards. For observing sessions greater than 30 minutes, collect data at 15-second epoch interval. For sessions less than 30 minutes, collect data at 5-second epoch interval. Track satellites down to at least 10-degree elevation cut-off.\n2 Base lines must be reobserved on different days with significantly different satellite geometry.\n3 The observing scheme requires that all adjacent stations have base lines observed at least twice on two different days with significantly different geometry.\n4 If base line is greater than 40 kilometers, a partially fixed or float solution is permitted.\nData Submission to NGS:\n1. The project accession number is of the form GPS-xxx. (The project accession number will be assigned by NGS when draft project plans are submitted to NGS for evaluation prior to the start of the project.)\n2. A project report and the data elements listed in Appendix L of \"Input Formats and Specifications of the NGS Data Base\" must be transmitted to NGS. Quality checks for conformance to NGS format standards shall be performed using software programs COMPGB and OBSDES.\n3. Latitude, longitude, and ellipsoid heights, as well as X, Y, and Z coordinates shall be provided in both NAD 83 and ITRF coordinate systems. See Appendix C for more information on transformation parameters and related information.\nGuideline Updates:\nThese Guidelines will be updated as the results of future projects and other procedures are reviewed. There are other procedures that will also achieve the standards. The user should note which procedures in this document were not followed and note how errors and systematic biases were detected, reduced, or eliminated by the new procedure.

The reported local accuracy is an approximate average of the individual local accuracy values between this control point and other observed control points used to establish the coordinates of the control point.\nNetwork Accuracy - The network accuracy of a control point is a value expressed in cm that represents the uncertainty in the coordinates of the control point with respect to the geodetic datum at the 95 percent confidence level. For National Spatial Reference System (NSRS) network accuracy classification, the datum is considered to be best supported by NGS. By this definition, the local and network accuracy values at CORS sites are considered to be infinitesimal, i.e., to approach zero.\nStations\nBase Stations\nPrimary - Stations evenly distributed that surround the local network. These stations relate the local network to NSRS to the 5-cm, or better, standard through simultaneous observations with control stations. They can be newly established stations and be part of the local network.\nSecondary - Stations evenly distributed throughout the local network that ensure that the local network does not contain a significant medium wavelength (20-30 km) ellipsoid height error through simultaneous observations with primary base stations. These stations may be newly established stations and are part of the local network. They are located between Primary Base Stations.\nControl Stations\nA- or B-order three-dimensional stations that surround the project area in at least three different quadrants. These stations relate the local network to the National Spatial Reference System through simultaneous observations with primary base stations. They must be referenced to NSRS and they provide the network accuracy. They may be newly established stations in the survey project if A- or B-order specifications and procedures are used to establish them. These procedures are not covered in this document, please contact NGS for additional information.\nLocal Network Stations\nThese stations include all other stations that are not base (primary or secondary) or control stations. They are part of the local network. They provide the local accuracy standard through simultaneous observations between adjacent stations.\n\n\fAppendix B. -- GPS Ellipsoid Height Hierarchy and Basic Requirements for 2-cm standard\n\nHARN/Control Stations\n\n(75 km)\n\nPrimary Base\n\n(40 km)\n\nSecondary Base\n\n(15 km)\n\nLocal Network Stations\n\n(7 to 10 km)\n\nHARN/Control Stations\n\nO CS1\n\nO CS2 <--------------------75 km------------------> O CS3\n\nPrimary Base Stations\n\nO CS1\n\nPB1\n\nPB2 <----------------------40 km--------------------->PB3\n\nO CS2\n\nCS3 O\n\nBasic Requirements\n\no 5 Hour Sessions / 3 Days\n\no Spacing between primary base stations cannot exceed 40 km.\n\no Each primary base station must be connected to at least its nearest primary base station neighbor and nearest control station.\n\no Primary base stations must be traceable back to 2 control stations along independent paths; i.e, base lines PB1 - CS1 and PB1 - PB2 plus PB2 -CS2, or PB1 - CS1 and PB1 - PB3 plus PB3 - CS3.\n\n\fSecondary Base Stations\n\nO\n\nPB1\n\nSB1\n\nSB2\n\nSB3 <---------- 15 km ---------- > SB4\n\nPB2\n\nPB3\n\nO\n\nO\n\nBasic Requirements\n\no 30 Minute Sessions / 2 Days / Different times of the day\n\no Spacing between secondary base stations (or between primary and secondary base stations)cannot exceed 15 km.\n\no All base stations (primary and secondary) must be connected to at least its two nearest primary or secondary base station neighbors.\n\no Secondary base stations must be traceable back to 2 primary base stations along independent paths; i.e., SB1- PB1 and SB1- SB3 plus SB3 - PB2, or SB1 - PB1 and SB1 - SB4 plus SB4 - PB3.\n\no Secondary base stations need not be established in surveys of small areal extent.\n\n\fLocal Network Stations\n\nO\n\nPB1\n\nLN1\n\nSB1\n\nLN2\n\nLN3\n\nSB2\n\nLN4\n\nLN5\n\nLN6<--7 km -> LN7\n\nSB3\n\nSB4\n\nPB2\n\nPB3\n\n0\n\n0\n\nBasic Requirements\n\no 30 Minute Sessions / 2 Days / Different times of the day\n\no Spacing between local network stations stations (or between base stations and local network stations) cannot exceed 10 km.\n\no All local network stations must be connected to at least its two nearest neighbors.\n\no Local network stations must be traceable back to 2 primary base stations along independent paths; i.e., LN1 - PB1 and LN1 - LN2, plus LN2 - SB1, plus SB1 - SB3 plus SB3 - PB2, or LN1 - PB1 and LN1 -LN3, plus LN3 - SB2 plus SB2 - SB4 plus SB4 - PB3.\n\n\fAPPENDIX C.--ITRF TO NAD 83 TRANSFORMATION PARAMETERS\nIntroduction\nThe International Earth Rotation Service Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF) has become an important coordinate system for users of Global Positioning System (GPS) technology. Both GPS and ITRF are global, geocentric coordinate systems. The ITRF coordinate system supports GPS orbit computations and provides a basis for more precise GPS data reduction computations. Also, for many applications it is necessary to use a coordinate system such as ITRF to account for the motions of the Earth's crust. Published ITRF solutions provide not only coordinate values at a particular epoch in time, but station velocities as well. Thus, up-to-date ITRF station coordinate values can be computed for future epochs in time after the original solution.\nThe North American Datum of 1983 (NAD 83), on the other hand, has the advantage of being fixed and stable relative to the North American tectonic plate. Additionally, NAD 83 has been officially adopted by the Federal government as the coordinate system for mapping and charting in the Unites States. Therefore, the relationship of ITRF to regional or continental datums like NAD 83 is of utmost importance to GPS users.\nThe following background information on NAD 83 should help understanding the differences, systematic and otherwise, between ITRF and NAD 83.\nNAD 83 Datum Definition\nThe NAD 83 adjustment combined terrestrial data (distances, azimuths, and direction observations) with space-based data, such as 3-D positions derived from satellite Doppler observations and 3-D inter-station vectors obtained from Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI).\nAlong with these data, and equally important, was a set of implied constraints that defined the scale and orientation of NAD 83. Also included in the NAD 83 adjustment was a set of global parameters that allowed the implied constraints to have complete influence. An example would be that of a distance observation which has implied scale, but if a global scale parameter is included in its observation equation, it allows the scale to be determined elsewhere. Table 1 shows the global parameters for the NAD 83 adjustment:\n\n\fTable 1.--Global parameters - NAD 83\n\nadjustment.\n\nParameter\n\nTerrestrial DopplerVLBI\n\nX Shift\n\nF\n\nY Shift\n\nF\n\nZ Shift\n\nF\n\nX Rotation Y Rotation Z Rotation\n\nF\n\nA\n\nF\n\nA\n\nF\n\nA\n\nA\n\nScale\n\nA\n\nF\n\nA\n\nF=fixed parameter A=estimated parameter\n\nThe above table shows that the 3-D positions derived from Doppler observations defined the geocentricity, scale, and the major part of the orientation of the NAD 83 datum.\n\nThe VLBI vectors are very important for several reasons. To begin with, the VLBI vectors are extremely precise. These vectors span the continent and are found to be internally consistent at the 2-3 cm level. Second, the VLBI stations and data are an integral part of the ITRF solutions and thus provide a link between NAD 83 and ITRF. Third, although the VLBI vectors were not used to help define the NAD 83 scale and orientation, the adjusted values for global parameters associated with the VLBI vectors tell how they were changed. This provides a quantitative measure of the systematic difference between NAD 83 and coordinate systems based on VLBI.\n\n\fTable 2.--Adjusted values for VLBI global parameters.\n\nParameter\n\nValue\n\nX Rotation Y Rotation Z Rotation*\n\n0.022 arc seconds 0.026 are seconds 0.010 arc seconds*\n\nScale Change -0.075 ppm\n\n*The actual adjusted value of the Z rotation was 0.375 arc seconds, however there was a post-adjustment correction of 0.365 arc seconds applied, resulting in the 0.010 arc seconds shown above. In effect the coordinate system was rotated to be more consistent with the VLBI observations.\n\nNAD 83 Upgrade Surveys\n\nIn 1988, the National Geodetic Survey (NGS) began to upgrade the NAD 83 coordinates by performing high accuracy reference network (HARN) GPS surveys. This is being done on a state-by-state basis. The strategy for determining the control for these upgrades follows. First consider the following (X, Y, Z) transformation, designated equation 1:\n\nXn = Tx + (1 + S)Xi + RzYi - RyZi\n\nYn = Ty - RzXi + (1 + S)Yi + RxZi\n\nZn = Tz + RyXi - RxYi + (1 + S)Zi\n\nThis equation defines a seven-parameter transformation from ITRF to NAD 83, where (Xi, Yi, Zi) denote geocentric cartesian coordinates in ITRF and (Xn, Yn, Zn) denote geocentric cartesian coordinates in NAD 83.\n\nIn order to establish control stations for the new HARN GPS surveys, NGS completed the following:\n\n1. NGS used a set of 12 VLBI stations located in North America to determine a seven-parameter transformation (equation 1) from ITRF89 (epoch 1988.0) to NAD 83 (see table 3).\n\n2. NGS decided to accept the scale of ITRF89 as being closer to the true value.\n\n3. The derived transformation parameters, translations, and rotations, but NOT scale, were applied to the complete set of ITRF89 positions to get NAD 83 values with corrected scale. A comparison with the original NAD 83 coordinates showed a change in ellipsoid height of 0.6 meters, which was caused by scale differences.\n\n\fTable 3.--Transformation parameters, ITRF89 (Epoch 1988.0) to NAD 83. Parameter\n\nValue\n\nTx = X Shift\n\n0.9191 meters\n\nTy = Y Shift\n\n-2.0182 meters\n\nTz = Z Shift\n\n-0.4835 meters\n\nRx = X Rotation\n\n0.0275 arc seconds\n\nRy = Y Rotation\n\n0.0155 arc seconds\n\nRz = Z Rotation\n\n0.0107 arc seconds\n\nS = Scale Change\n\n-0.0871 ppm [See item 3) above.\n\nApparent in Table 3 is the similarity of the values for the rotations and scale with those in Table 2. This indicates that the coordinate system of the original VLBI vectors is very similar to ITRF.\n\nComputations of GPS Data in ITRF\n\nSeveral other solutions of ITRF have been computed by the International Earth Rotation Service since the publication of ITRF89. As more and more data have been collected and included in the ITRF solutions, the resulting coordinates and velocities have increased in accuracy. Confidence in ITRF has grown to the point that most geodetic organizations throughout the world now use ITRF as a basis for GPS orbit computations.\n\nAn important concept for the GPS user community to understand is that since GPS precise orbits are referred to ITRF, fixed orbit solutions of GPS produce vectors that are oriented in the ITRF coordinate system. However, most of the user community is working in NAD 83. The systematic differences between ITRF and NAD 83 must be accounted for, if high accuracy is to be maintained.\n\nSince we are dealing with inter-station vector components, instead of positional coordinates, we need not worry about X, Y, Z shifts. Also, recall that the scale of NAD 83 was corrected when the high accuracy GPS survey began. But the X, Y, Z rotations between ITRF and NAD 83 must be accounted for. NGS adjustment software ADJUST does just that. ADJUST accepts GPS vectors expressed in ITRF as well as other coordinate systems as input, then, internal to the program, applies the X, Y, Z rotations to convert to NAD 83.\n\n\fTable 4 describes transformation parameters between NAD 83 and some more recent solutions of ITRF.\n\nTable 4.--Transformation parameters: ITRF solutions to NAD 83.\n\nParameter\n\nITRF93 (Epoch 1995.0)\n\nITRF94 (Epoch = E, in years)\n\nTx = X Shift\n\n0.9769\n\n0.9738 meters\n\nTy = Y Shift\n\n-1.9392\n\n-1.9353 meters\n\nTz = Z Shift\n\n-0.5461\n\n-0.5486 meters\n\nRx = X Rotation Ry = Y Rotation Rz = Z Rotation\n\n0.0264 0.0101 0.0103\n\n0.02755 + 0.00009(E-1996.0) arc sec 0.01005 0.00077(E-1996.0) arc sec 0.01136 + 0.00002(E-1996.0) arc sec\n\nS = Scale Change\n\n0.0\n\n0.0 ppm\n\n\fNOAA TECHNICAL PUBLICATIONS\nNational Ocean Service/National Geodetic Survey Subseries\nThe National Geodetic Survey (NGS), National Ocean Service (NOS), NOAA, establishes and maintains the basic national horizontal, vertical, and gravity networks of geodetic control, and provides Government-wide leadership in the improvement of geodetic survey methods and instrumentation; coordinates operations to assure network development; and provides specifications and criteria for survey operations by Federal, state, and other agencies.\nNGS engages in research and development for the improvement of knowledge of the figure of the Earth and its gravity field, and has the responsibility to procure geodetic data from all sources, process these data, and make them generally available to users through a central data base.\nGeodetic publications of NOAA, as well as the former Coast and Geodetic Survey and NGS, are sold in paper form by the National Geodetic Information Center.

Once marked Submitted, these items will not be re-exported during creation of subsequent DTON reports unless the \"Submitted\" flag is manually cleared prior to generating the report.\n\nOffice QC\n\nDenotes that AHB/PHB examination and verification have been completed for an item. The Pydro PSS for a completed survey to be submitted to HSD or otherwise archived shall not contain any Primary items that are not flagged Office QC. This is a Processing Branch tool only.\n\nRejected\n\nIdentifies any item that the hydrographer does not want included in the survey. Any pertinent information explaining why the feature has been rejected should be included under the Remarks tab of the Editor's Notebook. Rejecting an imagery feature in Pydro will flag the corresponding SIPS contact as rejected, but will not delete the contact. Rejecting a bathymetry feature in Pydro will clear the Outstanding flag in HIPS, but will not reject the corresponding sounding data.\n\nSignificant\n\nIdentifies features which meet the NOAA significant contact height criteria set forth in the HSSD (see section 5.2.2 and 6.2.1), or some other priority condition determined by the field unit, and warrant further investigation and/or development. If applied to a Primary feature, the Significant flag will automatically be applied to all correlating Secondary features.\n\nTgt Exported\n\nDenotes that an item was flagged Investigate and has been exported to MapInfo MIF/MID and HYPACK TGT format, typically for some subsequent investigation procedure. This flag will be set automatically when \"Export Investigation Items\" function in Pydro is performed. Once marked Tgt Exported, these items will not be re- exported unless the Tgt Exported flag is manually cleared prior to performing the export.\n\n\fIn Bathy\n\nForces a feature's least depth to be explicitly included in the PSS database of shoal-biased binned line (PVDL) data for plotting in Pydro, MapInfo (via Hydro_MI's \"Draw PSS\" function), or otherwise exported from Pydro. A sounding must first be classified as a bathymetric feature to be designated In Bathy. Once flagged In Bathy, that depth will take priority over other PVDL bathymetry data and other feature depths in the PSS during over-plot removal.\n\nDesignated\n\nThis flag is used to force a feature's least depth to be explicitly included in the two PSS bathymetry databases (as applicable) for display/analysis in Pydro (both over-plot removed Depths and ZSurfaces), plotting in MapInfo (via Hydro_MI's \"Draw Pydro Data\" Post Survey tool), or otherwise exported from Pydro: (i) HIPS BASE/Weighted Grid data and (ii) shoal-biased binned line (PVDL) data. During bathymetry layer over-plot removal (aka \"excessing\") in Pydro, feature depths may suppress other (deeper) feature depths; however, non-feature depths do not suppress feature depths, regardless of magnitude (i.e., all feature depths are regarded as being shoaler than all other depth nodes in the grid). In CARIS, the Designated flag should be used when a single least depth measurement is preferred over the weighted-mean depth calculation for BASE surface grid nodes. Designated soundings often equate to navigational significance and, hence, the desire for a symbolized feature to be rendered on the chart--and why HIPS Designated soundings are read into Pydro as candidate features (items from bathymetry). However, this is not always the case. For example, if the area of least depth has been adequately surveyed, yet contains a small number of soundings, the Designated flag should be used. Also, if a feature's least depth was determined by DLDG, the Designated flagging mechanism must be used to accurately represent the (single) measurement in the BASE surface. Designated soundings are applied to the BASE surface during the Finalize step in CARIS by checking the \"Apply designated soundings\" option.\n\nOutstanding\n\nFlagging a sounding Outstanding can only be accomplished in HIPS, but this action correlates to creating a bathymetry feature in Pydro. In other words, a sounding flagged Outstanding in the HDCS data will automatically be a bathymetry feature in the PSS. Likewise, creating a bathymetry feature in Pydro will write an Outstanding flag back to that sounding in the HDCS data.\n\n\fAttributing and Flagging for Automated Feature Reports\n\nSpecial Feature Types\nThe following attributes and flags shall be used to distinguish features for HCell compilation and the Feature Report. See section 8.2 of the HSSD for the official attribution table.\nNote: There are several logic paths for some of the items in Pydro\n\nSpecial Feature Types:\nDTONs\nAWOIS\nMaritime Boundary\n\nCARIS &\nHYPACK\n[sftype = 3 DTON]\n[sftype = 2 AWOIS]\n[sftype = 2 Maritime Boundary]\n\nPydro\nAccepted (i.e., not flagged Rejected) + Chart + DTON  Report + [Keyword == \"AWOIS\"]  Report + Accepted + Non-DTONs + Secondary AWOIS  Report + [Keyword == \"Maritime Boundary\"]  Report + Accepted + Non-DTONs + Secondary Maritime Boundary\n\n\fNew and Charted Features\n\nNew & Charted Features:\nNew Updated\nDisproval\nRetain\nNot Addressed\n\nCARIS &\nHYPACK\n[descrp = 1 New]\n[descrp = 2 Updates]\n[descrp = 3 Delete]\n[descrp = 4 Retain]\n[descrp = 5 Not Addressed]\n\nPydro\n Report + Accepted + NonDTONs (with no Secondary from Chart GP or AWOIS)  Report + [Keyword==\"DR_UnCharted\"] + [Chart = New]  Report + Accepted + NonDTONs (i.e., not flagged DTON) + Secondary ChartGP (but no Secondary from AWOIS)  Report + [Keyword==\"DR_Charted\"] + [Chart = Update]  Report + Accepted + NonDTONs (i.e., not flagged DTON) + Secondary ChartGP (but no Secondary from AWOIS)  Report + [Keyword==\"DR_Charted\"] + [Chart = Delete]  Report + Accepted + NonDTONs (i.e., not flagged DTON) + Secondary ChartGP (but no Secondary from AWOIS)  Report + [Keyword==\"DR_Charted\"] + [Chart = Retain]  Report + Accepted + NonDTONs (i.e., not flagged DTON) + Secondary ChartGP (but no Secondary from AWOIS)  Report + [Keyword==\"DR_Charted\"] + [Chart = Not Addr]\n\n\fOCS Hydrographic Branch\nTitle:\nSOP Guidelines for Creating a Backscatter Mosaic\n\nDocument #:\nN/A\n\nRev.:\n3\nPage #:\n1 of 14\n\nPROCESS OWNER This Process is owned by the NOAA IOCM Center\nSOP Custodian: Glen Rice\n\nREV 0 1 2 3\n\nREVISION HISTORY\nDescription of Change Initial release Updated with comments and corrections Updated with new data import plugin Updated for FMGT 7.3.4, which works with Hypack datagram version 2.\n\nAuthor Glen Rice Glen Rice Glen Rice Glen Rice\n\nEffective Date 5/5/12 6/14/12\n10/16/12 4/1/2013\n\nDocument Number HSSDM 2013 FPM 2013\n\nREFERENCE DOCUMENTS Document Title\nHydrographic Survey Specifications and Deliverables Manual 2013 Field Procedures Manual 2013\n\n\fHydrographic Survey Review\n\nDocument #:\nN/A\n\nTitle:\nPacific Hydrographic Branch Guidelines for Creating a Backscatter Mosaic\n\nRev.:\n3\nPage #:\n2 of 14\n\n1.

Responsibilities\n5.1 Hydrographic Vessel or Processing Branch Personnel  Perform processing tasks to convert raw data into formats usable by the backscatter mosaicing application.  Create backscatter mosaic.  Perform QC on mosaic.  Deliver to appropriate agency or contact if applicable.\n6. Procedure\n6.0 Introduction This SOP outlines the use of Fledermaus Geocoder Tool Box (FMGT) to QC backscatter data and/or create backscatter products for submission to NGDC. The products that will be archived at NGDC are Generic Sensor Files (GSF) or ALL files, which can be used for further backscatter processing by other interested parties, and a backscatter mosaic, which advertises the data and can be used to reveal general differences in bottom composition. The GSF files and ALL files are the most straightforward point for further processing because they contain both backscatter and processed bathymetry.\n6.1 Software The latest version of FMGT can be downloaded on the Hydrosoft website. It is recommended to work on a 64bit machine when possible.\n\n\fHydrographic Survey Review\n\nDocument #:\nN/A\n\nTitle:\nPacific Hydrographic Branch Guidelines for Creating a Backscatter Mosaic\n\nRev.:\n3\nPage #:\n4 of 14\n\n6.2 Create an FMGT Project\nSection 6.3.1 of the Fledermaus Reference Manual clearly outlines the steps to import data into FMGT. This manual can be found in Start > All Programs > Fledermaus \u00ad v7 > Manuals. In addition an FMGT training video (129MB) which provides an overview of FMGT can be downloaded from the Hydrosoft website under the documents link. This video should not be shared outside of NOAA.\nCurrently one FMGT project and one mosaic is produced per vessel per survey sheet.\n\n1. Create a Project where there is enough space (approximately \u00be of the backscatter file size): File > Create Project...\n\na. Direct FMGT to the project folder with the Browse button b. Name the Project c. Make sure \"Auto-compute output coordinate system\" is checked\nNote: Geocoder works in projected coordinates.\n\n\fHydrographic Survey Review\n\nDocument #:\nN/A\n\nTitle:\nPacific Hydrographic Branch Guidelines for Creating a Backscatter Mosaic\n\nRev.:\n3\nPage #:\n5 of 14\n\n6.3 Import lines into FMGT Project The GSF files are created by combining backscatter files and the processed depth files. Backscatter and bathy data from NOAA vessels are typically *.all files (Kongsberg with SIS) or HSX / 7K pairs (HYPACK with Reson systems), or *.sdf files (Klien Side scan with Sonarpro). The ALL files can be imported directly into FMGT because they contain the backscatter and processed depth information. HSX (bathy) files are processed in CARIS, which creates a CARIS HDCS data structure containing the ProcessedDepths file. FMGT combines pairs of 7K files with the HDCS lines based on the files names. SDF files are not currently supported, but are expected to be importable in the future.\n\n1.

Select \"Add File(s)...\" or \"Add Directory\" to select the 7K files for processing. If the \"Recursive\" box is checked, subdirectories will be searched too.\n\n\fHydrographic Survey Review\n\nDocument #:\nN/A\n\nTitle:\nPacific Hydrographic Branch Guidelines for Creating a Backscatter Mosaic\n\nRev.:\n3\nPage #:\n7 of 14\n\n3. Select \"Add Directory...\" and select the directory containing the corresponding HDCS lines. You can also select specific lines, but this method is more cumbersome because you need to select the ProcessedDepths file from each line folder. Since FMGT is matching files, it is okay to select a directory that contains more files than the 7k file previously selected. Leave the \"Recursive\" box checked.\n\n\fHydrographic Survey Review\n\nDocument #:\nN/A\n\nTitle:\nPacific Hydrographic Branch Guidelines for Creating a Backscatter Mosaic\n\nRev.:\n3\nPage #:\n8 of 14\n\n4. The files as paired are now displayed. Ensure correct pairing by scrolling through the files. A time offset between the HDCS and 7K files can be provided. This should be \"0.0\", but at times the HDCS data appear to have an offset so \"-1.0\" should be entered instead. There is not currently a way to determine if this offset is needed before processing. If there is a roll artifact in the mosaic, the offset is needed.\n\n5. Select FG_NAD83 for the Horizontal Coordinate system for the incoming lines, and leave the Vertical Datum as FD_Undefined.\n6.4 FMGT Configuration The FMGT Configuration parameters must be adjusted if processing RESON data because the RESON TVG curve is not correctly implemented in Geocoder. (If processing Kongsberg data skip to step 6.5.) If the user forgets to set the Configuration parameters to the TVG plugin the backscatter may be outside of the calibrated sonar filter range.\n\n\fHydrographic Survey Review\n\nDocument #:\nN/A\n\nTitle:\nPacific Hydrographic Branch Guidelines for Creating a Backscatter Mosaic\n\n1.

For a Reson system this includes the Pre-Processing, Bathymetry and Corrections stages.\n\nIn addition, the Correction stage should be set to ensure a proper absorption value is used for the frequency of the sonar. This value changes as a function of the water properties (see http://resource.npl.co.uk/acoustics/techguides/seaabsorption/ for further information)\n\n\fHydrographic Survey Review\n\nDocument #:\nN/A\n\nTitle:\nPacific Hydrographic Branch Guidelines for Creating a Backscatter Mosaic\n\nAs a guideline, use the following absorption values:\n\nFrequency\n\nAbsorption\n\n100kHz\n\n30db/km\n\n200kHz\n\n55db/km\n\n400kHz\n\n100db/km\n\nRev.:\n3\nPage #:\n10 of 14\n\n3.

The current HSD maximum size guideline for backscatter mosaics is 20 MB. This is only a guideline and may be exceeded if necessary. The value is set to 20 MB because it is a reasonable size file to manage (i.e. upload, download, view, etc.)\nAdjust the Mosaic resolution, paying attention to the memory required by the Mosaic. The final exported mosaic (tiff) size will be 5% to 10% of the memory used to in FMGT by a single tile. A reasonable starting value for the mosaic resolution is the maximum grid node spacing in a bathymetric surface for the same area. Do not press \"Compute\" after this value is changed. The \"Compute\" button is used for estimating the finest resolution.\n\n\fHydrographic Survey Review\n\nDocument #:\nN/A\n\nTitle:\nPacific Hydrographic Branch Guidelines for Creating a Backscatter Mosaic\n\nRev.:\n3\nPage #:\n12 of 14\n\n6.6 Creating a Mosaic\n1.

Purpose This document provides information for the operation of a 7000 series Reson Multibeam during hydrographic survey to also successfully collect backscatter.\n2. Scope Applicable to NOAA field units with a 7000 series multibeam in the 2013 season.\n3. Definitions and Acronyms\n4. Flowchart\n5. Responsibilities\n6. Procedure 6.1 General\nThese are guidelines for the setup and acquisition of a Reson 7000 series multibeam using Hypack. The goal is to ensure that Reson Snippets are recorded with the sonar settings at the time of acquisition. Snippets are recorded in the Hypack 7K file if the correct setup is used in Hypack. The Hypack 7K file must be paired with the HSX file as the 7K file does not include navigation\n6.2 Setup A. Recording Reson Snippets in Hypack\nThe following settings should be entered on the Hypack/Hysweep interface:\n1. In the Administrator window go to Hysweep Hardware 2. Select the 7125 device and go to the Setup button (in center of the window)\n\n\fHydrographic Survey Review\n\nDocument #:\nN/A\n\nTitle:\nSOP Guidelines for Backscatter Acquisition Setup and Execution\n\nRev.:\n3\nPage #:\n3 of 6\n\nFigure 1 Setup Reson data flow in Hypack\n3.

These are the records that HYPACK requests from the Reson machine. Version 1 records consist of the 7000 (sonar settings) record, 7004 (beam configuration) record, 7006 (bottom detection information) record, 7007 (side scan) record, and 7008 (snippets) record. Reson has encouraged switching from some of these records to newer versions. The Version 2 records (as termed by HYPACK) are the 7000 record, 7006 record, 7007 record, 7027 (raw bottom detection and configuration) record, 7028 (dynamic snippets) record, and 7503 record (sonar settings extended). The primary advantage of the Version 2 records for backscatter is that the snippet size is set dynamically (7028 record), but this record is not currently supported in post processing software. The usage of the 7027 record means the bottom detection must be corrected for the receiver to transmitter offset, but Hypack is collecting this information through the 7503 record so it is set automatically and does not need to be configured by the user. The 7027 record also contains a real time estimate of uncertainty for each bottom detection.\n\nB. Reson Setup\nWhen acquiring data through HYPACK, HYPACK handles which records are requested, so no specific setup different than normal survey is needed to ensure proper acquisition for backscatter. It is recommended that the \"Snippet Control\" on the Reson machine be secured to ensure no conflicts with HYPACK. This is found in Configuration > Data Display & Format. In the Snippets Control section, ensure \"Enable Snippets\" is unchecked.\n\nC. The Saturation Monitor\nConfiguration and setup of the Saturation Monitor is covered in the Saturation Monitor Manual in Satmon under General > Documentation. Basic usage, assuming correct setup and configuration has already occurred, is accomplished with the following steps.\n1. Start the Saturation Monitor from Start > All Programs > Pydro > Contributions > Satmon.\n2. Select Setup > From Network... 3. Press the Start button at the bottom of the Satmon Window. 4. When finished, press the same button now labeled as Stop. 5. Use General > Exit to close the program.\nThe purpose is to keep the Reson from saturating, and this is accomplished by keeping the Reson set so the Saturation Monitor plots are below the displayed zones.\n\n\fHydrographic Survey Review\n\nDocument #:\nN/A\n\nTitle:\nSOP Guidelines for Backscatter Acquisition Setup and Execution\n\nRev.:\n3\nPage #:\n5 of 6\n\n6.3 Multibeam Operation\n\nThe adjustment of multibeam settings should be minimized to limit the likelihood of artifacts in the resulting backscatter products, but changes can be made. Changes in depth or bottom type will inevitably require setting changes for good bottom detections which is also required for good backscatter. Sonar setting guidelines are as follows:\n\nPower 190 to 210 Gain 0 to 83\nAbsorption Follow Ops instructions, but okay to adjust Spreading 30 Pulse Length Set to 100 microseconds or greater\n\nThe sonar operator can change the power, gain, absorption and spreading during survey operations to maintain good bottom detection throughout the swath without affecting the backscatter (this is because the system is not saturated).\nChanging the pulse length still affects the backscatter, Instead:  Increase the spreading to improve the outerbeam detections.  Decrease the power to decrease saturation.\nLower the power slowly, allowing for the projector capacitors to discharge and the output power to be close to the recorded power.\nBottom detection quality should be monitored as with a normal hydrographic survey, but in addition the Saturation Monitor should be used. Both displays are useful (found under the plot menu) and provide slightly different information.\nThe \"Gain vs Receive\" plot (Figure 3 left) shows all the bottom detections as a function of the gain applied to the sounding and the received (uncorrected) backscatter level, and they are displayed with the saturation curve. Soundings below the curve are estimated to be in an unsaturated (and linear) state. Changing the absorption and spreading will make the soundings move up and to the right, but will also spread the soundings out along the horizontal axis. This is because the outerbeams, which are the soundings more to the right, have more gain applied because they are further away and so have more time varying gain applied. Power will move the sounding up and down vertically because it effects the backscatter strength (vertical axis) but not the gain (horizontal axis).\n\nThe \"Beam vs Percent Nonlinear\" plot displays by beam (horizontal axis) the received magnitude relative to the maximum allowable magnitude for the applied gain as defined by the saturation curve. In a nut shell, keep the histogram below the red line and below\n\n\fHydrographic Survey Review\n\nDocument #:\nN/A\n\nTitle:\nSOP Guidelines for Backscatter Acquisition Setup and Execution\n\nRev.:\n3\nPage #:\n6 of 6\n\nalso the yellow line when possible. Changing the absorption and spreading will affect the outer beams more than the inter beams, but power and gain will change them all together.\n\nFigure 3\nPower will lower the whole histogram, while absorption and spreading will help push up the outer beams.\n6.4 Quality Check To ensure that data is actually being collected, one line from each vessel from each day should be processed in Fledermaus Geocoder Toolbox (FMGT).

OVERVIEW The goal of this document is to create a combined surface to be referenced while conducting data analysis and quality assurances during the SAR process. It is best to combine the source grids using the program CARIS BDB and apply the appropriate combining rules and use the appropriate conflict rule file (*.crfx). 2. PROCEDURE The combining process is used to combine multiple source grids into a new output grid to be stored locally or on a database server. The bathymetric grids are combined when there are adjacent or overlapping surfaces that one intends to merge into one continuous and complete grid. The resolution of the single combined grid is usually combined at the coarsest resolution of the source grids. The intent is to maintain the shoalest depths from the source grids, incorporating to a coarser resolution grid. The combined grid is considered a product surface such that soundings may be extracted for comparison, conduct quality assurances of the gridded data, and also for generating the HCell products. Overlapping areas are de-conflicted with the application of userdefined rules. The user defined rules are referenced in a conflict rule file named \"BDB_ConflictRules.crfx.\" This file is normally located in the \"Reference\" sub-directory within the working \"AHB\" directory. The conflict file rules are based upon the following criteria and in this order: 1. Depth is least 2. Resolution is least 3. Uncertainty is least\n3. WORK INSTRUCTIONS (SOP) To combine surfaces:\n1. Open the surfaces that are selected for combining. 2. Select the Combine command. The Combine Surfaces dialog box is displayed.\nFigure 1: Combined Grid, 1\n3. In the Input Surfaces field, while pressing the <Ctrl> key, select the surfaces to be combined.\n\n\f4. Select Output stored to local disk to save the surface on the local machine 5. Click Browse (...) to select the Name and location for the output surface. 6. Click check 2: Options.\nClick Browse (...) for the selection of the proper Horizontal projection.\n7. Select the appropriate resolution of the combined surface: for the SAR, this will be the resolution of the coarsest grid (i.e. if combining a 50cm, 1m and 2m grid the appropriate resolution will be 2m. (Reference HTD 2010-6)\n8. Next, Click 3: Extents\n\nFigure 2: Combined Grid, 2\n9. Using the cross hairs, select the extent of the combined grid in order to minimize the \"white space\" that will be included in the combined grid\n\n10. Next click, 4: Conflicts\n\nFigure 3: Combined Grid, 3\n\n\f11. In the Conflicts window select > tag Import, then navigate to the following directory within the survey data directory structure: AHB_HXXXXX\\Reference and select the file named \"BDB_ConflictRules.crfx.\"\nFigure 4: Combined Grid, 4 12. Once one has selected the conflict rules to apply, the \"OK\" button will become active. Click the \"OK\"\nbutton to execute the combined grid process\nFigure 5: Combined Grid, Finishing 4.

OVERVIEW\n\nSOP: Ellipsoidally Referenced Surveys\n\nThis SOP outlines processing procedures to process an Ellipsoidally Referenced Survey (ERS). Any errors or concerns with the technical information herein should be addressed to Corey Allen (Corey.Allen@noaa.gov)\n2. GLOSSARY OF PROCESSING TECHNIQUES\nApplanix IN-Fusion Single Baseline \"SingleBase\" - One dedicated base station is used to process a tightly coupled solution for short base line processing up to approximately 20km. The base station may be user-installed or downloaded form the various available networks (CORS/IGS/SOPAC). Ephemeris corrections should be downloaded to obtain to highest level of precision of ephemeris available at the time of processing (e.g. Ultra-Rapid, Rapid, Precise).\nApplanix IN-Fusion Smartbase \u00ad Smartbase processing is based on Trimble VRS technology, the virtual reference station solution that uses a network of user-installed or continuously operating reference stations to compute a set of correctors for the roving receiver anywhere within the network. Smartbase processing requires a minimum of four reference stations surrounding the rover, but distance to the nearest reference station can be extended to 70km.\nApplanix IN-Fusion PPP \u00ad Precise Point Positioning is a processing method that provides positioning accuracies on the order of a few decimetres without needing a reference station. This application is useful when a reference station cannot be found or installed within allowable distance tolerances.\n\nAcronyms SBET--Smooth Best Estimate of Trajectory RINEX--Receiver Independent Exchange Format POSPac--Position and Orientation System Post-Processing Package QC--Quality Control RMS--Root Mean Squared GNSS--Global Navigation Satellite System PPK--Post processing kinematics\n\nEffective Date: 3/7/2011\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\n\nHard Copy of this SOP is obsolete- the OCS QMS electronic procedure is valid\n\nPage 2\n\n\fSOP: Ellipsoidally Referenced Surveys\n3.

Batches can be created for a project, a day, port side, starboard side, or a combination of all of the above. During active survey ops, it is recommended to batch by day number. It is necessary to wait until at least four hours after acquisition to post-process navigation (PPP requires rapid, not ultra-rapid orbit data). A size-restricted internal file in POSPac MMS does not allow a 24-hour day of POS data to be processed without crashing. Essentially, a 24hour acquisition day batch will produce two SBETs per IMU.\n Select Run  Batch Manager\n Click the New Batch icon in the upper left corner of the pane\n\n Save the batch configuration file to the POSPAC folder in the appropriate project, use the naming convention DN###_batch.posbat\n In the Batch Editor window o Enter a project name: YYYY_DDD_VSSL o Navigate to and select the appropriate First File POS data file for the vessel and day o The Last File field will auto populate but will need to be set manually if the number of POS files goes beyond *.099 (i.e. *.100).

If the radial spike corresponds to any spikes in the Real-time positions, we can assume the error occurred in real time and was not introduced by the post-processing.\n Make a recommendation to apply the SBET o Apply: You believe the data looks good and have seen no reason to suspect the data quality o Apply with inspection: You believe the data looks okay, however you have seen some questionable values in the data that the sheet manager should be aware of o Needs troubleshooting: You believe this data is of poor quality, with fatal errors, or highly suspicious values. This data should not be applied to a sheet\nAdvanced Troubleshooting and considerations If you encounter any major issues, one of the key questions will be determining if the vessel was even logging data during the time of the error. Convert the time displayed on a plot or in the overview screen into a time to compare to .hsx logging times (or vice versa). If the error is within logging times, inspect the lines manually and using directed editing techniques.\nFiles can be reprocessed in POSPAC using alternative processing methods (PPP, Smartbase, Singlebase) and without using batch and have the resultant solutions compared using plots, or navdiff the resultant sbets. Start and end times of processing can also be altered to not process certain parts of the file.\nErrors apparent in a given vessel can be compared across the same vessel during different days, or compared to other vessels at the same time. Many vessels experiencing a similar error at the same time could imply external sources (Atmosphere, satellites, etc), whereas a recurring error on one vessel may be indicative of an internal issue (settings, hardware, software).\n\nEffective Date: 3/7/2011\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\n\nHard Copy of this SOP is obsolete- the OCS QMS electronic procedure is valid\n\nPage 43\n\n\fSOP: Ellipsoidally Referenced Surveys\nAutomated SBET QC\nThis feature allows you to run a small program which requires an input of POSPac Project and the associated NAVDIF Reference SBET and will output the required metrics including: Smoothed Performance Metrics, Calibration Installation Parameters, Solution Status Values, and SmoothedReference Data.

OPUS is a great tool for getting a very precise position for centimeter accuracy. We use the position calculated by OPUS to correct for inaccuracies in the acquisition platform's position. In addition, Field Procedures say we are required to obtain an OPUS solution from at least a 4 hour observation on a benchmark. We like to submit our base station position to OPUS when we first acquire data and then do a weekly submission in order to verify the position is still accurate during hydrographic acquisition. In order to obtain a precise solution, OPUS can take up to 19 days to obtain a final precise orbit because it uses a combination of seven analysis centers worldwide and these centers take several days to upload the orbit data to the International GNSS Service (IGS).\nObtaining a Solution After creating a RINEX file from the base station receiver raw file you may then submit the file to OPUS in order to get a precise position solution. If bandwidth is an issue, as it usually is aboard the ship, you may need to decimate and zip the RINEX file in order to get the file size smaller to achieve a reasonable upload time (a 3 mb file usually takes about 3-5 minutes to upload on the ship). Once your RINEX file size is reasonable, got to the OPUS website at: http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/OPUS/\n\nFrom the figure above follow these steps: 1. Enter your email address 2.

This will take you to the following page\n\nLeave all numbered sections as is except for 4. Extended Output and 5. Draft XML Output. Choose \"Yes\" for both of these and they will be included in the OPUS solution emailed to you. At the bottom section 8. Choose \"STATIC\" if your observation was more than 2 hours. This will give you a more precise solution. After choosing \"STATIC\" you should receive a pop-up window stating that your file is being uploaded. Once it is uploaded, it will take some time for OPUS to create a solution. Check your email in about 15 minutes and you should receive a solution. Once you do, open the email and save all the text as your OPUS solution. The solution will give you useful information like your antenna name, antenna height, start and stop times of the observation, and most importantly, your latitude, longitude, and ellipsoid height (this position is what you will input for your base station coordinates in POSPAC when processing true heave data).\n\nEffective Date: 3/7/2011\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\n\nHard Copy of this SOP is obsolete- the OCS QMS electronic procedure is valid\n\nPage 79\n\n\fSOP: Ellipsoidally Referenced Surveys\n\nEffective Date: 3/7/2011\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\n\nHard Copy of this SOP is obsolete- the OCS QMS electronic procedure is valid\n\nPage 80\n\n\fSOP: Ellipsoidally Referenced Surveys\nSubmitting to the OPUS Database You first must register with OPUS in order to submit to their database.

The GAMS calibration data is used because in general it is the most dynamics that a vessel will see. This helps resolve the offsets quickly in post processing and to a higher degree of confidence.\nProcessing The general idea is to process the POSMV data multiple times at the 10cm confidence level. Each time inputting the resulting calibrated installation parameters as the initial lever arm offsets for the following run. This is repeated until the resulting offsets vary by only millimeters.\nProcess the SBET in POSPac and QC the solution.\nTo get statistically robust final values for the calibrated installation parameters there is a macro that runs in Pydro. Open Pydro, on the menu bar select Misc  Run Macro. Select CalcPOSMViincalLeverArmStats.py\n\nNavigate to and check the project name, click descend/confirm, this will find the \"Proc\" folder.

The integrity of the data can be checked at any later time by recomputing the checksum and comparing it with the stored one.\nNOAA field units shall create MD5 checksums for all digital data submitted to the processing branches. This SOP outlines the procedure for creating, verifying, and reporting the results of the verification process using the program FileVerifier++.\nThis SOP is intended to be used with FileVerifier++ version 0.6.3.5830W or later.\n2| Creation of Checksums\nTo create checksums, first copy all the digital data to be submitted to the processing branch to the submission drive. Once all the data has been copied, create a MD5 checksum file with Unix Line Endings, Unix Path Separator Characters and a custom MD5 file comment using the following procedure:\n1. Open FileVerifier++ by opening the fv.exe file from Windows Explorer 2. If this is the first time you have run the program, go to Tools ->Settings->Preferences\n\n\fa. Under General ->Compatibility change i. Line Endings for Text Files to Unix (LF) ii. Path Separator Character to Unix (/)\nb. Under General->File Comments change i. Default File Comment to \"Hexadecimal MD5 checksums created at {insert field unit name here} on YYYY-MM-DD\" ii. Check Prompt For Comment Upon Save\nc. Under Tools->Settings->Default Encoding-> Select \"Hexadecimal\" d. Under Tools->Settings->Select \"Use relative paths when adding files\"\n\n\fe. Under Algorithms-> Select \"MD5\"\n3. Once you have all your settings correct, you can add the files to be checksumed a. Select the \"Dirs\" button and browse to the H12345 folder on the submission drive b. Under Operations-> Select \"Calculate Entries [ALL]...\"\n\n\fc. Enter the base path of the submission folder (ex. T:\\H12345) in the Relative path names entry dialog and click okay\nd. The process will begin and you will get a status bar telling you how far along you are\n\n\fe. When it is finished, click on the \"Save\" button i. Give the checksum file a name using the naming convention HXXXXX_Checksums.MD5 and place it in the base folder (ex T:\\H12345) ii. Save as \"MD5 Hashes (MD5SUM Style) (*.MD5)\"\niii. Answer \"Yes\" to the question about relative path stripping\niv. Modify the date in the comments to the current date\n\n\f3| Verification of Checksums\nTo verify checksums, first copy all the submitted digital data to the network drive where it will be stored. Then verify that the data has not been altered by loading the checksum file and comparing the checksums of the files as they currently exists to how they existed on the ship using the following procedure:\n1. Open FileVerifier++ by opening the fv.exe file from Windows Explorer 2. If this is the first time you have run the program, go to Tools ->Settings->Preferences\na. Under General ->Compatibility change i. Line Endings for Text Files to Unix (LF) ii. Path Separator Character to Unix (/)\n\n\fb. Under Tools->Settings->Default Encoding-> Select \"Hexadecimal\" c. Under Algorithms-> Select \"MD5\" 3. Open the MD5 Checksum file by clicking on the \"Load\" button\n\n\fa. If you have\" Verify files automatically\" selected in the Tools->Settings menu, the comparison will begin automatically.\nb. If not, under Operations-> Select \"Verify Entries [ALL]...\"\nc. The Relative path names entry dialog should already be pointing to the current root folder but if not, point to it now and click OK.\n\n\fd. The process will begin and you will get a status bar telling you how far along you are\n4. When the verification process is complete, sort the columns by \"Verification\". If any files have been altered or deleted between the field unit and the processing branch network they will show up as Invalid and be colored red. These files will need to be re-transmitted from the field unit to the processing branch.\n\n\f5.

REFERENCE DOCUMENTS......................................................................................................4\n\n\fDocument Type: SOP\n1. OVERVIEW\nThe Total Vertical Uncertainty Quality Check (TVU QC) is a simple way to identify nodes in the submitted grid that have estimated uncertainties that exceed the NOAA specifications. The NOAA uncertainty standards are based on IHO S-44 standards for hydrographic surveys. Specifically, the TVU QC layer compares the estimated uncertainty of the depth estimate to the allowable uncertainty of the depth estimate node by node.\nThere are multiple methods to identify the nodes that have estimated uncertainties that exceed the NOAA specifications. The best practice is to use the ratio method which visualizes the ratio of the uncertainty at a node to the maximum allowed IHO uncertainty for each node via a computed layer in CARIS. This TVU QC layer scales with depth and demonstrates what fraction of the total allowable error budget is consumed by the estimated uncertainty. In addition, only one new CUBE child layer is required for each IHO Order (1 or 2).\n2. WORK INSTRUCTIONS\nThe Compute Layer function is used in CARIS HIPS & SIPS or CARIS BDB to create a new custom attribute layer from one or more existing layers. The hydrographer should use the Finalized surface because this surface will identify areas where either the uncertainty or the standard deviation exceeded the maximum allowable error and the greater of these two values is used in addition to having the Uncertainty scaled to a 95% CI, whereas unfinalized surface Uncertainties are reported at the 68% CI.\nThe IHO Order specifications change with depth. Use the following guidelines for determining the IHO Order specification:\n IHO Order 1 for 1m, 2m, 4m, and 8m surfaces.  IHO Order 2 for 8m, 16m, and 32m surfaces.\nNote: Two layers should be created for 8m surfaces for evaluation: IHO-1 layer 72-100m and IHO2 layer 100-160m.\nRatio Method\n2.1 Create TVU QC Layer a. Select the parent layer of the surface in the Layers window. b. Open Compute Layer Window: i. HIPS & SIPS -> Right-click and select `Add Layer' ii. BDB -> Select Tools->Layers->Compute Layer.\nSee next page for images.\n\nEffective Date: Date\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\n\nPage 2\n\n\fDocument Type: SOP\n\nc. Enter the Layer Name (e.g. IHO_Order_1) using the IHO guidelines above. d. Select the Layer Direction from the drop down list (i.e. depth positive down or height\npositive down). e. Enter the appropriate equation using the table below in to the Attributes field:\n\nIHO Order\n\nSurfaces\n\nOrder 1 1m, 2m, 4m, 8m\n\nOrder 2 8m, 16m, 32m\n\nEquation\n-Uncertainty/((0.5^2 +((Depth*0.013)^2))^0.5) -Uncertainty/((1.0^2 +((Depth*0.023)^2))^0.5)\n\nf. Click OK.\nEffective Date: Date\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\n\nPage 3\n\n\fDocument Type: SOP\n2.2 Review the TVU QC Layer The results from the ratio method visually demonstrate if and by how much the estimated uncertainties have exceeded the NOAA specifications. The properties of the TVU QC layer can be modified to improve visualization. Specifically the user should use the most appropriate Colour Map file or create a Colour Range template. If using a Colour Range template the values which do not require further examination are from -1 to 0 and the values which do require further examination are from -100 to -1, however the ranges should be broken down into finer collections so the user can take advantage of showing the fraction of allowable error budget.\nThe TVU QC layer should be examined not only for the 95% confidence level but also for spatial indicators such as different uncertainty behavior between lines, patterns and/or clusters of noncompliant nodes which may indicate a systematic error, TPU model error, or noisy data.\nThe TVU QC layer is one tool for evaluating the TVU. The hydrographer should use the TVU QC layer in conjunction with other tools such as a distribution (e.g. histogram) plot, the Python \"Standards Compliance Evaluation\" tool by Weston Renoud, spreadsheets and the CUBE layers.\nHistograms can be created in CARIS using the Compute Statistics function. Select the parent layer of the surface -> Right Click -> Compute Statistics. Select the IHO_Order_1(or2) layer and a bin size.\n\n3.

OVERVIEW\nCARIS Notebook may be used to apply tide correctors to point features. However, if a TCARI tide method is required then Pydro must be used to create the compatible tide file. This SOP describes how Pydro is used to create a CARIS \"single station\" tide file (.tid) that is a 1:1 ratio with the feature records.\n2. WORK INSTRUCTIONS\nCARIS Notebook: 2.1 Export the features Export the features that need to be tide corrected to S-57 .000 (or GML) format. This file will be used by a utility in Pydro as a \"navigation\" file to create the .tid file.\na. Perform a feature selection in Notebook. The utility in Pydro uses the NOAA extended attribute \"obstim\" in computing the tide records. To select features with the \"obstim\" attribute populated (i.e. not equal to null), right click and Create Layer by Attribute Value with the following:\nb. File->Export->To S-57 (or GML will also work).\n\nEffective Date: Date\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\n\nPage 2\n\n\fDocument Type: SOP\nPydro: 2.2 Generate TCARI .tid file\na.

Select Tides->CARIS TCARI Tide->Create TCARI TID File via S-57, and select the S57 file from step 1). (Note: there are menu options to opt for PREDICTED tides as generated by TCARI; if you want predicted tides rather than TCARI tides, use that menu option.)\n\nCARIS Notebook:\n2.3 Correct the features for tide a. Perform a feature selection in Notebook, using the same query from step 1) b. Go to Tools->Load Tide ->Single tide station observations: browse and select the .tid file created in step 2).\n\nEffective Date: Date\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\n\nPage 3\n\n\fSSS Contacts to $CSYMB\n02/27/2014 Overview This SOP outlines the procedures for NOAA field units to translate CARIS SIPS side scan sonar contacts to Cartographic Symbols ($CSYMB) in a .000 format for further analysis in CARIS BDB. This is the most efficient method because Pydro automatically creates the $CSYMB features, attaches the CARIS SIPS images to the $CSYMB feature and packages the images in to a single zipped folder which can be extracted to the Multimedia folder.\nCARIS HIPS & SIPS  Pick and attribute contacts.\nPydro  Config -> User Preferences  Toggle ON \"Auto $CSYMB SIPS contacts on insert; w/ images\" and the appropriate SSS contact image (Mosaic, Speed Corrected, or Uncorrected). All three can be exported but this will create three copies of each image.\n Insert SSS Lines which contain contacts o Data ->Insert HIPS/SIPS Line Features  Select Lines with SSS contacts to insert  Apply\n Export SSS Contacts to .000 o Data -> Export -> S-57 Features to ISO 8211 (.000) o Use \"Default\" as Filter o Name .000 $CSYMB file o Intended Usage = Harbor (5)\nWinZip  Unzip new SSS contact image folder - Pydro automatically zips all images which are correlated to SSS contacts.
