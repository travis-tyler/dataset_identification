[{"section_title": "", "text": "timing of irrigation water, fertilizer, and pesticides, plant earlier in the season or adjust acreage allocations, and adopt drought-tolerant seeds or no-till production practices. In the long run, land can be substituted towards less water-intensive crops or biofuels feedstocks, retired from production, or relocated to less impacted regions. Very recent adaptation options include \"prescription agriculture\" (seeds designed to meet individual operations' requirements) and non-traditional, \"early-warning\" weather insurance products. Conditional on severity of climate change, farmers are likely to adjust cropland allocations or crop choice, especially in regions where other adaptation strategies are unavailable or too costly. For example, in response to reduced access to irrigation water, farmers engaged in irrigated agriculture may need to alter planted acreage, whereas others may switch crops (Hornbeck and Keskin, 2014;Hendricks and Peterson, 2012). The question that our research seeks to answer is three-fold: (i). How does weather impact selection of major crops in the central US? (ii). Conditional on crop choice, what are the weather effects on harvested acreage? (iii). How might climate change influence cropland use and cropland allocation in this region? To address these questions, we implement well-known two-step estimation routines on cross-sectional farm data in 17 states. The estimation accounts for selection into three crops: (i). corn, (ii). soybeans, and (iii). all other crops, while controlling for county-level differences in soil characteristics that may contribute to inherent productivity. The balance of the paper is arranged as follows. The next section briefly surveys recent studies on cropland use and climate, with an emphasis on selection models using farm-level data. Section 3 describes the basic empirical model, and Section 4 explains data sources and construction of variables. The subsequent section lays out the empirical results and provides implications about near-term climate change. The final section concludes, and the appendix contains econometric results."}, {"section_title": "Related Research", "text": "In more recent years, the chief economic sources of land-use change in developed countries are government policies, technical change, energy feedstock demands, increasing export demands, and climate change. To evaluate the impacts of each of these factors on land use change and conversion requires careful econometric work. For example , Mendelsohn and Dinar (2009) reviews the following well-known feedback loop: land use ultimately influences climate change through greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, while climate change and frequency of extreme climate events can alter land use. In the first part of the feedback loop, cropland use emits carbon and nitrogen dioxide, harvesting mature timber and forest conversion to agriculture emits carbon, and livestock emit methane. These emissions contribute to adverse climate change and have welfare effects, sometimes with negative or positive implications for localized agriculture. For example, recent climate research suggests changes in cropping patterns in the central US influence the water cycle, with forecasted increases in intense precipitation (Groisman et al., 2012). The second part of the climate-land use feedback loop draws on econometric analyses of yields or land values, crop simulation or farm simulation models, and general equilibrium models. The results vary widely, but they all underscore the continued importance of an evolving climate for agriculture (Mendelsohn and Dinar, 2009). A related study by Massetti et al. (2013)  The researchers test the significance of: using degree days rather than daily temperature, using truncated rather than untruncated degree days, cold degree days, existence of a 34 \u2022 C threshold, and differences in degree day and daily temperature impacts across the growing season. Controls include gridded weather data from the National Climatic Data Center's (NCDC) North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR), socioeconomic variables, and soils variables (innate characteristics and index numbers) from the US Geological Survey (USGS). They find no practical difference between regression coefficients of daily temperatures, degree days, and truncated degree days, no evidence of a 34 \u2022 C threshold, and significant differences across seasons in precipitation and temperature variables. Results are robust to: using degree hours, omitting the last two years, applying cross-sectional rather than panel methods, and using various soils data. Similar to the above study and our current research, the Anderson et al. (2012) working paper uses an underlying multinomial logit model to motivate loglinear regressions of crop shares on interactions of county soil and climate characteristics. The authors consider interactions between degree days, minimum temperatures, precipitation, sunshine, various soil variables, and plant characteristics. Tentative findings point out significant effects of these interactions on crop shares. An additional strand of the applied agricultural economics research places more emphasis on structural econometric techniques. Fezzi and Bateman (2011), Lacroix and Thomas (2011), and Kaminski et al. (2013) is a group of closely-linked studies starting from underlying models of farmers' profit maximization to examine the relationships between climate and land use in England, France, and Israel, respectively. The first paper implements quasi-maximum likelihood for two systems of Tobit equations characterizing livestock supplies and land use shares, incorporating various environmental and climatic data. Among their findings is that shares of cereals land, root crops, and permanent grasslands are highly nonlinear in soil suitability indices. Lacroix and Thomas (2011) estimates elasticities of output, land, and fertilizer using a model that accounts for multivariate selection, i.e., weather shocks influence a certain crop's yields while also affecting probability of planting various crops. The last paper in this group starts from an expected-profit maximizing farmer with a (Pope and Just, 2003) yield function to ultimately derive climate's impact on technology, which impacts land allocations. They consider four technological attributes (yield potential, input requirements, yield tolerance to suboptimal input use, and managerial costs) and conclude that climate adaptation research should mainly target input requirements' sensitivity to precipitation. Another complementary set of empirical studies estimates relationships among major crop yields and weather variables, with forecasts based on differing climate scenarios. Mc-Fadden and Miranowski (2013) use Bayesian dynamic linear regression and dynamic beta models on a sample of 11 US states to estimate time-varying coefficients (productivities) of weather variables and nitrogen-weather interactions in explaining state-average corn yields. They find that Corn Belt yields will increase by 28-33% and Great Lakes states yields will increase by 37% during 2011-2031. Further, there is evidence that late-season temperatures and precipitation have more substantial impacts in later years of the 1960-2011 sample. This research builds on Miranowski et al. (2011), who fit autoregressive (AR) and linear trend models to annual corn yields for a similar time period and sample of states. Break testing procedures point out that some states have multiple breaks, and the sample is accordingly partitioned to develop short run and long run forecasts to year 2030. Long run forecasts from linear trends indicate growth of 1-2 bu/ac per year, and short run models project 3-4 bu/ac growth in recent years, though weather effects are not included. Schlenker and Roberts (2009) fit eighth-order polynomials to county-level yield data on corn, soybeans, and cotton for 1950-2005 while controlling for several weather effects. Their main result is that increasing temperatures are beneficial up to a certain point and then detrimental to yields. Additional studies are Ortiz-Bobea (2013b), Ortiz-Bobea and Just (2013), and Ortiz-Bobea (2013a), which further stress the importance of nonlinearities, growth-stage (seasonally disaggregate) variables, and soil moisture impacts on corn yields. Regarding methodology, a body of work in empirical energy economics uses selection models, usually two-step methods, to analyze fuel switching (electricity, natural gas, fuel oil, and so on) and subsequent energy demand (Mansur et al., 2008;Newell and Pizer, 2008;Hanemann et al., 2013). This line of research adapts earlier work on selection and models that relate first-stage choices with second-stage choices via correlations in disturbances (Heckman, 1979;Lee, 1983;Dubin and McFadden, 1984). Across studies, there is much variability regarding the key drivers of first-stage decisions, though most are firmly grounded in economic theory. For example, Mansur et al. (2008) uses climate, firm-specific information, building characteristics, and demographic data to explain fuel choice for residential and commercial buildings, finding that climate change will likely boost electricity use for cooling and reduce other fuels for heating. In a similar study, Seo and Mendelsohn (2008) use data on 949 farmers in South America (Brazil, Chile, Uruguay, Argentina, Ecuador, Venezuela, and Columbia) to estimate a multinomial logit model of crop choice. Although the intensive margin (land allocation) is not estimated, they find that farmers will switch from wheat, potatoes, and corn to squash, vegetables, and fruit through year 2100. Finally, the research seeks to learn from previous studies incorporating the ARMS data, a complex stratified dataset that has been underemployed in environmental economics. The ARMS data have been used for many empirical objectives, but all can provide insight into methodologies, variables selection, and data differences over the cross sections (Goodwin and Mishra, 2005;Kirwan, 2009;Mayen et al., 2010;Gillespie et al., 2010). There are known limitations with the dataset, most notably that it does not contain panel data on farms (though some operations may be sampled in multiple years), and the current analysis must be careful to take these limitations into consideration (National Research Council, 2008)."}, {"section_title": "Empirical Model", "text": "The two-step estimation procedure used to correct for selection in the acreage equation is the discrete-continuous framework of Dubin and McFadden (1984). This is a wellknown selection correction technique and is more robust and general than the Lee (1983) approach. Despite potential problems arising from multicollinearity between regressors and selection terms, the Dubin and McFadden (1984) method requires fewer assumptions and can provide adequate correction when the Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA) assumption does not hold (Bourguignon et al., 2007;Schmertmann, 1994). Following the notation of Bourguignon et al. (2007), assume that agricultural producers maximize utility by choosing a primary crop, c, and then planted acreage, A c . 1 For a choice c \u2208 C set of crops, the producer receives latent indirect utility: In the above equation, z c is a vector of observable variables, \u03b7 c is an unobserved distur-bance, and the analyst observes V c = 1 if c is chosen (and zero otherwise). After selecting crop c, the firm's cropland allocation decision (conditional input demand) is: where x c is a vector of exogenous factors that influence allocations, and u c is a random error. Note that E(u c |x, z) = 0 and V ar(u c |x, z) = \u03c3 2 c . Selection occurs as a result of Corr(u, \u03b7) = 0, which renders ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates of \u03b2 c in 2inconsistent. A producer chooses crop c if it yields highest indirect utility: Assuming that \u03b7 c is distributed type I extreme value, then the multinomial logit model ensues, and as shown by McFadden (1973), the probability of (3) is: Beyond this, Dubin and McFadden (1984) impose a restrictive assumption that the , which further restricts distributional forms for u c since \u03b7 j is given a type 1 extreme value distribution. Bourguignon et al. (2007) relaxes this assumption and permits normality of \u03b7 j by computing is the standard normal inverse cumulative distribution function (CDF). Correcting for selection, (2) becomes: where r * c = corr(u c , \u03b7 * j ), m(P c ) involves integrating over values of \u03a6 \u22121 (\u2022) centered at log P j , and w c is an independent error. See Bourguignon et al. (2007) for more details. As pointed out by Mansur et al. (2008), the correction terms in the above equation provide some economic insight. Particularly, the correction term for crop j in equation c measures the impact on acreage of crop c for those farmers predicted to have selected crop j. For example, if there is a statistically significant and positive correction term for soybeans in the OLS regression of corn acreage, then soybean farmers are predicted to boost corn acreage. Importantly, these selection terms partially absorb the impacts of crop rotations, thus helping to alleviate omitted variables bias in the acreage equations. In the following econometric analysis, equations (1) and 5 "}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "The Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) is a key source of information about agricultural production, management practices, financial conditions, and household attributes of US farms. In its current format since 1996, it dates back to earlier surveys starting in 1975 regarding farm costs and returns, chemical use, and cropping practices. The survey occurs over three phases in a year (June through April) with stratified sampling over two mutually exclusive frames: a list frame of farms with certain production aspects and an area frame that randomly samples land segments. Over the sample period, the number of surveyed farms in phase III fluctuates from 9,573 in 1996 to 20,406 in 2011, though sample sizes are roughly 20,000 starting in 2003. Among the phase II data are observations on field-level production practices, e.g., choices of capital, applied fertilizer, pesticides, and irrigation, and tillage, though only one field is randomly sampled for each surveyed farm. The phase III data contain observations on farm-level practices, business and household finances, technology adoption, and labor allocation (on-farm and off-farm) (ERS, 2013). Farm-level data for a 17-state area are taken from the 2010 ARMS Phase III Cost and Returns Report (CRR) questionnaire. 3 We consider cross-sectional data in 2010 for the following reasons: (i). 2010 is a year in which corn farms are extensively surveyed in phase II of ARMS, (ii). in-sample variation among oilseeds and grain farmers is large, in part because of interesting weather patterns (e.g., local flooding in the Midwest) and increased biofuels production, and (iii). it is one of the more recent years for which data are available. There is rich variability across an array of production and management variables in the survey data. However, our approach is a straightforward and transparent application of well-known discrete-continuous methods, so the resulting data requirements are less stringent. Farms are classified as primarily corn, soybeans, or other crops farms based on which crop's value of production accounts for 50% or more of the farm's total 2010 production value. This is a common farm classification approach and is consistent with categories used in the US Census of Agriculture. Adopting this criterion, our sample consists of 2,119 corn farms, 975 wheat farms, and 9,401 other farms. Owing to relatively small sample sizes, we are not able to reliably estimate the second-step regressions in (5) using reported planted acreage. Harvested acres are instead used as the dependent variables in the least squares regressions. In recent years, harvested acreage has been consistently and stably proportional to planted acreage, which renders it a suitable proxy. 4 Data on harvested acres are reported in section B of the 2010 CRR questionnaire. 5 Table   1 in the Appendix contains descriptive statistics for the ARMS variables. Following much of the land-use change literature, we control for time-invariant geologic and hydrologic factors in soils that contribute to soil productivity. Generally, soil structure and land characteristics have much bearing on land use and allocations, and the significance of these factors for farms' decision making may increase with an evolving climate. However, the full economic implications of soil quality and soil productivity are difficult to assess and require a fuller understanding of soil sciences. Weather data are from the Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM). These involve simple regressions of climate variables (e.g., temperature, precipitation, dewpoint) on elevation using nearby, weighted station data for various \"topographic facets\" (slopes). The PRISM model outputs interpolated weather data for grids of size 800m x 800m (roughly), which can be used to construct county-level measures (Daly et al., 2008). For the months of May, June, July, and August 2010, we average daily PRISM data for the corresponding months and then add the relevant grids for each county. Although recent research identifies more complex weather controls, for transparency, we include basic measures of temperature and precipitation and their squares. Table 1 in the Appendix lists summary statistics. Lastly, we construct state-level expected prices for corn, soybeans, and wheat according to the methods of (Barr et al., 2011). 9 For corn and soybeans, we first average the daily To calculate basis, we first average the daily November and December 2010 close prices for the soybean and corn contracts ending in these same months (the futures prices). From these figures, we subtract state-level corn and soybean prices received by farmers in the averages) in a similar way, except the harvest-time contract is July. See Appendix Table   1 for the in-sample summary information."}, {"section_title": "Empirical Results", "text": "The multinomial logit results for choice of corn (the extensive margin) are provided in Table 2. Column one shows results for a general model that includes expected prices for corn, soybeans, and wheat and focuses on soil textures rather than soil properties (i.e., hydraulic conductivity, available water capacity, and K factor). 11 Overall, the model uses 5,306 farm observations, and the fit is adequate: the model is jointly significant at the 0.01 level and performs better than an intercept-only model (pseudo R 2 ). Note that a relatively smaller sample size arises because of incomplete soils variables in some counties. choice, but among weather variables, only August temperatures matter. This is comparable to other studies showing that temperatures (and their extremes) matter more than average precipitation, but not necessarily intense precipitation (McFadden and Miranowski, 2013). The fourth specification is preferred because of parsimony and use of relative expected prices, which are more economically meaningful than expected prices in level terms. While the selection terms (S 1 , S 2 , S 3 ) in the corn and soybeans equations are not significant, the correction terms for corn and soybeans in the other acreage equations are positive. This has the following intuition. The subset of farms predicted by the discrete choice model to be other crop farms would be likely to increase corn and soybeans acreage had they not been other crop farms. Similarly, each of the acreage equations has at least one significant association between disturbances in the first-step and second-step regressions. For instance, corn acreage is negatively associated with selection into other crops (-1.06), while soybeans acreage is negatively associated with selection into corn (-1.84). This is important for two reasons. Firstly, it lends support to the selection framework and suggests that applied cropland use studies that do not account for selfselection have potentially biased results. Secondly, it suggests that selection terms in the regression equations are a possible option for controlling rotation effects (assuming that predicted crop choice is roughly equal to actual crop choice). interested in climate change outcomes on crop selection. Figure 1 examines fitted choice probabilities of corn, soybeans, and the other crops as functions of July weather, evaluated at the sample means of all other regressors. 17 In particular, the horizontal axis considers combinations of July temperature and rainfall at the 10 th -90 th percentiles of the sample distribution. For corn, we find a relatively smooth pattern: at low July temperatures and rainfall, choice of corn is very high, but at relatively high July temperatures and rainfall, the selection probability decreases. As in other agriculture-climate studies, this suggests that the limiting factor in corn production is largely temperature. Choice probabilities for soybeans are flat, while other crops exhibit the mirror image of corn. Although there are potentially offsetting effects of more July rainfall, as average July temperature rises, adoption of other crops increases. Taken together, the results give partial-equilibrium predictions about near-term climate impacts, e.g., mild switching from relatively \"thirsty\" crops to less moisture-sensitive crops in vulnerable areas."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "A growing body of empirical work in agricultural and environmental economics indicates that changes in short-run weather and long-term climate patterns will impact crop production, contingent on farmers' mitigation or adaptation behavior. We add to this literature by posing the following questions: (i). How does weather impact the choice of growing corn, soybeans, and other crops in the central US? (ii intense events (rather than more evenly spread across the season), then there may be larger adaptation gains by curtailing nutrient leaching, runoff, and soil erosion. The estimation results are preliminary, and there are several avenues for future work. The current analysis uses cross-sectional variation for a single year. Straightforward robustness checks should be implemented to examine the impacts at differing survey years. Similarly, sample data can be pooled across two or more years to improve degrees of free-Regarding specification, we can also test the significance of various weather interactions, soil-weather interactions, other weather variables (e.g., dew points and evapotranspiration), and other nonlinear transformations. The literature is divided concerning a \"best\" specification, and the useful nature of our farm-level cropping and county-level weather and soils data may shed new light on this issue. Lastly, a system of input demands can be estimated in the second-step regressions. In addition to acreage, the system could include irrigation and tillage practices, nutrient and chemical use, and would provide a more comprehensive, farm-level framework for assessing weather impacts.
