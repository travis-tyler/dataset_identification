[{"section_title": "Overview", "text": "\"Adaptation Action Area\" or \"Adaptation Area\" is an optional comprehensive plan designation for areas that experience coastal flooding and are vulnerable to the related impacts of rising sea levels for the purpose of prioritizing funding for infrastructure needs and adaptation planning. Local governments that adopt an Adaptation Action Area may consider policies within the coastal management element to improve resilience to coastal flooding. Florida communities have been actively and increasingly addressing both coastal and inland flooding over the last several decades. This has partly been in response to increasing risk and exposure, but it has also reflected a major paradigm shift from post disaster recovery to proactive resilience that prevents and mitigates risks. This new awareness has stimulated innovative approaches: increasing partnerships and outreach, new risk assessment tools, and forward-thinking mechanisms in planning. An example of one of these multi-layered community collaborative responses is the leadership in Palm Beach, Broward, Miami-Dade, and Monroe Counties via the Southeast Florida Regional Climate Change Compact (SFRCC). Statewide, there are more trailblazing communities that have laid the foundation for adaptation to current and future coastal flooding risk. By addressing current flood issues with updated policy and design criteria, these communities instill co-benefits as they integrate planning and regulatory objectives to address impacts related to sea level rise. Effective strategies are now supported by State Statute to promote and support further adaptation initiatives around Florida. Adopted into the Florida Statute in 2011 through the Community Planning Act, Adaptation Action Areas provide a flexible and optional framework that can be applied to the entire State through individual local action. At the request of coastal communities, DEO created this guidance to assist communities understand how they can use Adaptation Action Areas to adapt to coastal flooding. Florida (Chapter 163,Fla. Stat.) requires each local government authority to create, adopt and maintain a comprehensive land use plan. The local comprehensive plan is a key driver of development and redevelopment because it outlines legally enforceable guidelines and strategies, directly influencing the decision-making process. Comprehensive plans can be amended to create strategies for merging growth with resilience. This creates possibilities for continuously revisiting and updating best practices for sustainable development, post-disaster redevelopment, green infrastructure, water management, and protection of natural resources. In the context of sea level rise, planning today via tools such as Adaptation Action Areas improves the preparedness and resilience of communities, in a way that persists over time. The voluntary policy option described here is a formative way to assist local governments in addressing the potential hazard impacts associated with sea level rise. This Guidebook is intended to be a \"how-to\" illustration to guide local governments interested in integrating Adaptation Action Areas into policy and operational frameworks. This Guidebook will describe a broad process for engaging community stakeholders,"}, {"section_title": "Introduction Adaptation Action Areas Resources", "text": "The Adaptation Action Areas Guidebook is part of a series of resources intended to support local governments, working with their region and with the State of Florida, to create the best opportunities for merging growth with resilience by implementing Adaptation Action Areas.

This guidance and related work is part of a Project of Special Merit (PSM) funded by NOAA and coordinated through the Florida Coastal Management Program (DEP) and DEO's Community Resiliency Initiative, focused on developing and implementing Adaptation Action Areas policy, advancing partnership between the City of Fort Lauderdale, Broward County, South Florida Regional Planning Council and the Southeast Florida Regional Climate Compact.

The intent of such a designation would be to address coastal hazards and potential sea level rise impacts in a specific location. Local governments may pursue adaptation planning strategies within the designated area and prioritize funding for appropriate infrastructure improvements. Local governments may consider possible strategies which are in line with adaptation, as described in the State Statute addressing the principles, standards etc. of the coastal management element. Adaptation Action Areas and other spatial designations are intended to guide a community in reaching their own goals for coastal resiliency. The goal of Adaptation Action Areas is to improve resilience to coastal flooding or any other resilience-related objective of a local government's choosing, and it can be met via a wide range of adaptation options. Some communities may choose to direct infrastructure away from vulnerable areas, while others may choose to prioritize infrastructure improvements to maintain and protect designated areas. In some cases, communities are already planning for and implementing adaptation activities, through hazard mitigation or environmental conservation projects. Such actions can be better leveraged when recognized as having current and future benefits."}, {"section_title": "Keywords related to Adaptation Action Areas defined:", "text": "\u2022 Adaptation: Adjustment in natural or human systems in response to actual or expected stimuli or their effects, which moderates harm or exploits beneficial opportunities. \u2022 Coastal flooding: Flooding which occurs when water is driven onto land from an adjacent body of water. This generally occurs when there are significant tropical storm events, such as hurricanes. \u2022 Flood: An overflow of water onto normally dry land. The inundation of a normally dry area caused by rising water in an existing waterway, such as a river, stream, or drainage ditch. Flooding is a longer term event than flash flooding: it may last days or weeks. \u2022 Flash flood: A flood caused by heavy or excessive rainfall in a short period of time, generally less than 6 hours. Flash floods are usually characterized by raging, quick moving water after heavy rains. Section 163.3177(6)(g)(10), Florida Statutes At the option of the local government, develop an Adaptation Action Area designation for those low-lying coastal zones that are experiencing coastal flooding due to extreme high tides and storm surge and are vulnerable to the impacts of rising sea level. Local governments that adopt an Adaptation Action Area may consider policies within the coastal management element to improve resilience to coastal flooding resulting from high-tide events, storm surge, flash floods, stormwater runoff, and related impacts of sea-level rise. Criteria for the Adaptation Action Area may include, but need not be limited to, areas for which the land elevations are below, at, or near mean higher high water, which have a hydrologic connection to coastal waters, or which are designated as evacuation zones for storm surge. \u2022 Mean sea level: The height of the sea surface averaged over all stages of the tide over a period of time, typically computed over a 19-year period. \u2022 Sea-level rise: An observed increase in the average local sea level or global sea level trend. The two major causes of global sea-level rise are thermal expansion caused by the warming of the oceans (since water expands as it warms) and the loss of land-based ice (such as glaciers and polar ice caps) due to melting. \u2022 Storm surge: An abnormal rise of water generated by a storm, over and above the predicted astronomical tides. Storm surge should not be confused with storm tide, which is defined as the water level rise due to the combination of storm surge and the astronomical tide. \u2022 Stormwater runoff: Is generated when precipitation flows over land or impervious surfaces and does not percolate into the ground. As the runoff flows over the land or impervious surfaces (paved streets, parking lots, and building rooftops), it accumulates pollutants that could adversely affect water quality if the runoff is discharged untreated."}, {"section_title": "Keywords related to high-tide events defined:", "text": "\u2022 Local tides: are related to astronomical considerations (related to the position of the Earth, sun and moon) and non-astronomical factors such as configuration of the coastline, local depth of the water, ocean-floor topography, and other hydrologic and meteorological influence. \u2022 Extreme water levels: extremely high or low water levels at coastal locations are an important public concern and a factor in coastal hazard assessment, navigational safety, and ecosystem management. Exceedance probability, the likelihood that water levels will exceed a given vertical elevation, is based on a statistical analysis of historic water levels. \u2022 Highest astronomical tide (King tide): the elevation of the highest predicted astronomical tide expected to occur at a specific tide station. Tides are acted upon by gravitational forces of the moon and sun are produced when ocean waters undergo \"heaping\" action resulting from the horizontal flow of water toward two regions of the earth being pulled on by the sun and moon. \u2022 Perigean tide: occurs when the moon is closest to the earth. \u2022 Spring tides: occur twice each lunar month (during full or new moons), during which high tides are a little higher and low tides are a little lower. \u2022 Perigean spring tides: are the largest astronomical tides, occurring when spring tides and perigean tides coincide. They occur at intervals that are slightly more than six months long, so each year they are later in the season than the preceding year. For this reason, we must refer to tables of predicted tides to know exactly when to expect these unusually high tides. The introduction to this guidebook has provided readers with a description of the topic at hand, DEO's involvement with Adaptation Action Areas, and useful information about the guidebook, including definitions. With this information, the reader may feel equipped to read and interpret the rest of the guidebook in a manner consistent with technical assistance provided by the state on coastal flooding. It is our hope that, once a community has engaged with all or part of this guide, it will be able to surmount its particular barriers to implementing Adaptation Action Areas. As Adaptation Action Areas represent a strong mechanism through which a community may prepare for potential future coastal flood hazards, this guide is highly recommended for municipalities who wish to increase their coastal flood capacity and resilience. Chapter 1: Adaptation Action Areas and the Adaptation Planning Process In this chapter, the recommended components of an adaptation plan are described. Next, the relationship between Adaptation Action Areas and the Components of an Adaptation Plan are described. Examples from six Florida communities are used to explain this relationship. Communities have the option to consider using and approaching Adaptation Action Areas in many different ways, and therefore, it is important to discuss these different uses and approaches. In general, communities are likely to approach Adaptation Action Areas two different ways. A first set of communities will consider the utilization of Adaptation Action Areas as part of their overall adaptation planning process. A second set of communities will use planning for Adaptation Action Areas as their primary adaptation planning activity. This guidebook illustrates the activities essential to Adaptation Action Area planning whether or not the Adaptation Area is the primary focus of the community's future coastal flood hazard preparation. The Components of an Adaptation Plan section (page 12) provides an organizational framework for discussing these uses and approaches, and how they might relate to a community's overall adaptation planning process. By tying the use of Adaptation Action Areas more closely to the overall planning process, planners will be able to: better identify the interrelationship of Adaptation Action Areas to other adaptation efforts they are or could become involved with; tie lessons learned, guidance or staff responsibilities to the respective community's adaptation planning process; and, identify through case studies, how Florida communities have already began to approach and use Adaptation Action Areas."}, {"section_title": "2", "text": "Community 1: Adaptation Action Areas result from an overall adaptation planning process."}, {"section_title": "Community 2: Adaptation Action", "text": "Areas is the vehicle for conducting adaptation planning."}, {"section_title": "See below,", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Figure 2", "text": "All Components"}, {"section_title": "Components of an Adaptation Plan", "text": "There are four (4) essential components be considered for inclusion in the adaptation planning process: Context, Vulnerability Assessment, Adaptation Strategies, and Implementation Strategies (see Figure 2 for a full listing of all components). Within each of these four main components are a number of supporting tasks (i.e., subcomponents) that will assist each community plan for its own optimal sea-level rise adaptation. It is important to note that these components are not intended to be approached linearly, and communities are likely to take many different planning approaches to meet their individual adaptation needs. In Figure 2, the components that SFRPC and the City of Fort Lauderdale employed for the purpose of their Adaptation Action Areas pilot are outlined in green. The outcome, or designated Adaptation Action Areas, is aligned with sub-component 4.2 Integrate into Existing Plans, which is denoted by a gold star ( ). 1. Context. For the first part of an adaptation planning process, communities are encouraged to consider factors typical of all planning exercises, with a focus on how each factor relates to sea-level rise adaptation. This includes a survey of existing geographic, social, infrastructural, and environmental conditions. It also entails the creation of principles (e.g., goals, objectives and policies) to guide the planning process, which are distinct from prioritized needs set during the Adaptation Strategies Analysis phase. Context refers to the preparatory activities taken by the planning team and the community to increase their understanding of the planning issue at hand, and to unite and fortify their efforts addressing the issue. 1.1 Assemble a Steering Committee. In order to write a sea-level rise adaptation plan that reflects the expertise and interests of the community's local stakeholders, a steering committee can be assembled. Steering committees have the ability to enhance all ensuing activities in the adaptation planning process."}, {"section_title": "Sea-Level Rise Adaptation Plans", "text": "Main and Supporting Components  1.2 Identify Opportunities for Community Participation. Within this sub-component, the planning team is encouraged to identify opportunities for community participation to discuss the resources created during the Vulnerability Assessment, Adaptation Strategies, and Implementation Strategies components. 1.3 Set Guiding Principles and Motivations. By deciding on guiding principles and motivations, the community can establish its compass for navigating through the following components. The principles and motivations are one of the plan's most inter-active sub-components, and may be recalled to assist decision-making activities in the second, third, and fourth components. 1.4 Describe the Planning Context. Describing the planning context offers an opportunity to analyze prior adaptation planning efforts that may have occurred within or near the community, information gaps related to adaptation planning, the available human capacity (such as coastal scientists and land-use planners), and the outside resources needed to conduct the locally desired planning effort. Essentially, this sub-component provides a chance to assess the scope of work and the resources applicable to the adaptation planning process. 2. Vulnerability Assessment. The Vulnerability Assessment represents the second component in the sea-level rise adaptation planning process, and consists of measuring the impact of sea-level rise and identifying the people, infrastructure, and land uses that may be affected. Vulnerability is often used interchangeably with risk when measuring hazard impacts. The Vulnerability Assessment draws from the Risk Assessment framework described in the Code of Federal Regulations (Title 44 CFR 201.6 (c)(2)), which measures the hazard exposures a community is likely to experience, and the sensitivities -e.g., populations and land uses -that may be exposed to the identified hazards."}, {"section_title": "Conduct an Exposure", "text": "Analysis. An exposure analysis utilizes a sea-level rise projection to answer the question \"where\" based on two choices -when (what horizon) and how much (which scenario). The \"where\" will depend on which computer model is used (e.g., SLAMM, SLOSH, ADCIRC etc.) to produce the sea-level rise projection. The analysis can depict which areas in the community are likely to be susceptible to the chosen sea-level rise scenario on a map. 2.2 Conduct an Impact (Sensitivity) Analysis. Conducting an impact (sensitivity) analysis helps the community to identify natural resources, structures, populations, and other entities located in areas that are at risk to the sea-level rise scenario projected during the Exposure Analysis."}, {"section_title": "Assess Adaptive", "text": "Capacities. This sub-component encourages the community to measure the degree to which it is equipped to adapt to sea-level rise, through the existence of policies, structures, finances, and human resources that can assist or already are assisting to adapt to potential changes. 3. Adaptation Strategies. Adaptation Strategies represent the third component in the adaptation planning process, and are in effect a set of responses to the findings from the Vulnerability Assessment. Adaptation strategies are often classified according to their status as Protection, Accommodation, and Retreat (PAR) strategies. There are also a set of supporting activities that assist the development of the strategies themselves, which are described in this component. This component also identifies how adaptation strategies can be prioritized for each focus area, then applied through PAR and No Regrets interventions. Adaptation Strategies refers to the toolkit of responses that communities can take to adapt to sealevel rise, as well as the steps taken to decide which adaptation strategies are the best fit based on the needs of individual communities. 3.1 Assign Focus Areas. With the assistance of the steering committee and community stakeholders, the planning team may assign focus areas. This sub-component responds to the sensitive entities identified in the vulnerability assessment and assigns community preferences to areas that will receive the majority of adaptation strategy attention."}, {"section_title": "Identify Adaptation Strategies by Focus Area", "text": "\uf0b7 Protection -Hard and soft structurally defensive measures to mitigate the impacts of rising seas (e.g., seawalls, bulkheads, rip-rap, and living shorelines). \uf0b7 Accommodation -Physical design alterations allowing a structure or land use to remain in place (e.g., floodable development, floating structures, and bio-swales). \uf0b7 Managed Retreat -Relocation of existing development / limitation of future development (e.g., rolling easements, transfer of development rights, and design for dis-assembly). \uf0b7 No Regrets -Comprehensive and Targeted Strategies, such as incorporating sea-level rise scenarios into other plans and enhancing sea-level rise outreach. 3.3 Prioritize Adaptation Needs. Component 3.3 recommends that the planning team assess the relative merits and costs of each adaptation strategy within a given focus area, in order to prioritize the preferred adaptation strategy. This may be accomplished through a benefit-cost, alternatives analysis, stakeholder feedback or even new output from a tool utilized during the Vulnerability Assessment. 4. Implementation Strategies. Once a set of adaptation strategies has been developed and analyzed, it is recommended that communities prepare for the supporting activities that can facilitate adaptation activities to be successfully undertaken. This includes locating, preparing for, and applying for potential funding opportunities; creating a schedule of adaptation actions for the future, and addressing monitoring and evaluation needs. Implementation Strategies encourage communities to look into available funding for adaptation activities, describe which groups will complete which tasks, and create mechanisms to evaluate how the adaptation plan strategies are being accomplished."}, {"section_title": "Survey Funding", "text": "Options. A systematic review of all known funding sources, as well as inquiry into new funding opportunities that may facilitate a successful implementation strategy. 4.2 Integrate into Existing Plans. In order to integrate the components of the sea-level rise adaptation plan into other plans, the planning team is encouraged to: identify all relevant documents, assess documents for potential inclusion points, and (if applicable) initiate collaboration with the responsible party to ensure that the applicable sea-level rise objective can be included at the time of the next update. 4.3 Create a Schedule of Adaptation Activities and Actors. Provide an impetus to the actions to be completed and the staff responsible for each action. This sub-component can serve to program different types of adaptation activities according to their prioritized need (see sub-component 3.2 above), and in pairing with funding opportunities, generate a concise and easy-to-follow plan. 4.4 Monitor and Evaluate. Monitoring and Evaluation extends throughout the horizon of the plan's implementation, which could extend decades. The ability to communicate the guiding goals of the plan across generations of implementing actors is essential. This is done through a Monitoring and Evaluation plan that uses consistent language, such as \"indicators\" that can be tracked throughout the implementation horizon, and rated as to successfulness by different implementing actors."}, {"section_title": "Approach and Use of Adaptation Action Areas: Relationship to Components", "text": "There have been at least five Florida communities that have used Adaptation Action Areas in their local adaptation planning processes. These communities include: Broward County, City of Fort Lauderdale (Broward County), Miami-Dade County, the City of Satellite Beach (Brevard County), Town of Yankeetown (Levy County), and the Town of Inglis (Levy County). Each of these communities have approached and used Adaptation Action Areas differently. As well as these completed efforts, the community Village of Pinecrest (Miami-Dade County) has proposed to add a new element to their comprehensive plan that includes designation of Adaptation Action Areas. In addition to outright Adaptation Action Areas entering into community plans, other Florida communities have engaged in adaptation planning. In so doing, Punta Gorda and Palm Beach County have both considered the use of adaptation overlays or special designated areas to accomplish the goals of protecting local assets, similarly to an Adaptation Action Area. Each of these Florida communities have already demonstrated that Adaptation Action Areas can be used and approached in many different ways. As a use, Adaptation Action Areas can be considered a strategy and tool. As a strategy, communities have used Adaptation Action Areas: \uf0b7 As the focus of the adaptation planning process, whereby the end goal of the process was to adopt Adaptation Action Area language into policy and/or to assign focus areas; \uf0b7 To spatially delineate areas subject to future Adaptation Action Areas policies; and, \uf0b7 To spatially delineate areas subject to other adaptation planning and policy tools."}, {"section_title": "As a tool, Adaptation Action Areas have been used:", "text": "\uf0b7 As overlay areas; and, \uf0b7 To prioritize areas for adaptation planning efforts. How a community approaches and uses Adaptation Action Areas has a direct impact on the adaptation planning process that a community ultimately follows. As highlighted above, communities are likely to consider many different approaches and uses for Adaptation Action Areas. The one continual similarity between all of the Adaptation Action Area planning processes observed to date is the similar language used by communities to describe the components of their local processes. Communities highlight actions such as \"forming technical advisory committees\", \"conducting vulnerability analysis\", \"prioritization\" and \"identifying funding options.\" The use of similar language and comparison of Adaptation Action Areas planning process outcomes suggests that there is a significant overlap between the two approaches. In order to meet the needs of all Florida communities, this guidebook utilizes the Components of an Adaptation Plan as framework for discussing the Adaptation Action Area planning process. Although the six Florida communities that have already used Adaptation Action Areas may not have addressed all of the components, or have addressed components in different orders -the framework provided by the Components will allow for information, examples and comparisons to be organized and shared in an approachable format."}, {"section_title": "Adaptation Action Area Planning", "text": "As described above, adaptation planning is comprised of a series of steps that a community takes to become more resilient to the impacts of sea level rise. Planning for Adaptation Action Areas, a specific application of the adaptation process (with the end goal of adopting Adaptation Action Areas into policy), requires consideration on several distinct levels. There is a technical dimension, a social dimension, and a policy dimension. Each of these dimensions necessitates the identification of underlying principles, motivations and characteristics that are unique to each coastal community. The points of consideration provided in this guidebook are meant to assist officials leading their communities to incorporate sea level change scenarios in local, state, and regional planning efforts. The following four chapters describe ways in which to: \uf0b7 Assemble advisory support from local experts and officials; \uf0b7 Design principles and motivations and provide opportunities for community input; \uf0b7 Describe the planning context; \uf0b7 Conduct an exposure analysis; \uf0b7 Conduct an impact analysis; \uf0b7 Prioritize adaptive needs; \uf0b7 Develop adaptation strategies; and, \uf0b7 Integrate these strategies into plans and an Adaptation Action Areas ordinance. Figure 3 presents the sub-components highlighted as part of the Adaptation Action Area planning process in a graphic format. The following four chapters will group the sub-components according to their groups within the larger adaptation planning process and provide vignettes related to each chapter taken from the Florida communities who have already integrated Adaptation Action Areas into their planning efforts. As Figure 3 makes apparent, the activities are interactive, building upon one another as they engage with the end-goal of integrating the particular Adaptation Action Area policy into local plans. Communities may engage in several steps simultaneously, as flexibility often facilitates the strength of the overall product. As chapter 1 makes clear, the adaptation planning process incorporates aspects of planning from other disciplines and links them to the scientific undertakings needed to provide the most unbiased, accurate picture of future hazards possible. Adaptation Action Areas and the planning that this policy tool enables let communities work toward an end-goal of adopting overlay mappings and accompanying policies into municipal code (and other plans, when appropriate). In this way, Florida communities have an exciting opportunity to easily integrate novel coastal flood hazard knowledge and resilience preparations into their policy documents. Most effective planning efforts begin with a pre-planning stage during which the community assembles personnel, puts-together a participation and outreach program, and connects to the relevant experts and pre-existing data that will assist them to complete the actual planning effort. The sections within this chapter guide users through considerations that are important for developing a steering committee, setting guiding principles, developing an understanding of the local planning context, and integrating opportunities for community participation."}, {"section_title": "Establish a Steering Committee", "text": "Planners do not need to know how to do everything related to adaptation planning.

To ensure that adaptation is well-received in your community, simple posting of information on the city's website is a first step, but it will likely not be enough. Positive public information efforts are more likely to impact behavior. It is not enough that people know they are in a hazardous area; they need to want to do something about it. Community members must understand the effects each strategy will have on them and what actions they can take. Therefore, messaging is very important. A key public engagement approach is to shift from \"telling\" towards \"asking\" about what should be done. Residents are deeply connected to where they live, and crowdsourcing information can add a new layer to a vulnerability analysis."}, {"section_title": "Creating and Managing a Coastal Community Technical Advisory Group", "text": "A coastal community can create a sea level rise technical advisory group made up of technical, planning, and budget staff, as well as interested or affected community businesses and residents to develop a plan for their community. Roles could include efforts such as: 1) Investigate federal, state and local funding assistance and grants; 2) Determine how collected funds (including those from any imposed Adaptation Action Area impact or concurrency fees that a community may associate with an Adaptation Action Area) will be prioritized; and, 3) Link desired capital improvement projects with other regional, infrastructure, public service, and/or emergency management and hazard plans the local government may have adopted or could benefit from partnering with. In addition to funding, a technical advisory group can assist the community with understanding their priorities and assets. This technical advisory group can provide the link to the community for overall buy-in by all stakeholders in the community for a long-term plan. In addition to community staff, recommended members include individuals with experience in diverse backgrounds. \uf0a7 Acknowledge that questions remain. These two sources identify the importance of preparation for outreach and creation of specific content areas.

The history of hazards around the State relate to hurricanes, tropical storms, and severe weather. Currently, hazards have been increasingly unpredictable; Florida was directly impacted by twelve (12) named storms in 2004 and 2005, including Charley, Ivan, Frances, and Wilma. The record-breaking 2005 Atlantic hurricane season had four (4) category-5 hurricanes 3 . With possibly increasing irregularity in weather patterns and rising sea-levels, in addition to growing coastal populations and development, there is a need to amplify both the preparation and response to coastal hazards. The majority of Floridians live less than 60 miles from the Atlantic Ocean or Gulf of Mexico. Florida has 1,350 miles of coastline, 4,500 square miles of our estuaries and bays, and over 6,700 square miles of other coastal waters. Deyle, Bailey, and Matheny 4 reported that sea level rise may have the following four major impacts of concern related to the planning and management of coastal planning areas: \uf0b7 Coastal inundation and shoreline recession; \uf0b7 Increased flooding from severe weather events; \uf0b7 Saltwater intrusion contaminating potable coastal well fields; and, \uf0b7 Lifting of coastal aquifers closer to the ground surface, limiting storage and drainage capacity. Flooding is a threat with many dimensions. There are four main kinds of flooding: tidal flooding, increased elevations of storm surge from tropical storm events, increased precipitation causing surface water to overtop stormwater management systems, and reduced soil storage capacity. Sea level rise heightens the foundation (base or starting sea level) which storm surge and extreme tides build upon (see Figure 4). Global changes in sea-level vary in local effect. Figure 5 illustrates recent historic global sea-level change and future projections going to 2100. When sea-level rise combines with strong storms, barrier islands experience high storm surges which increases the effects of flooding and erosion. As part of a joint U.S. National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) project to assist in planning for future risks 5 , the USACE sea level rise calculator tool was modified to include the equations used for the NOAA scenarios and to allow for comparisons. Figure 6 shows the local, or relative sea level change in Key West, FL results from the calculator tool. Impacts defined in the Adaptation Action Areas key terms section (page 7) are described here, beginning with hightide events. Currently, extreme tides in Florida tend to occur during the Perigean spring tides, or king tides. As the minor flood thresholds are surpassed in low-lying areas during these tide events, nuisance flooding occurs in the streets with limited property damage. Sea-level rise has the potential to force these extreme tides higher and further inland, and areas impacted by tidal flooding may grow in frequency and magnitude. In the future, these tides are likely to bring moderate to severe flooding. According to the Florida Oceans and Coastal Council (2010): Three-fourths of Florida's population resides in coastal counties that generate 79% of the State's total annual economy. These counties represent a built-environment and infrastructure whose replacement value in 2010 is $2.0 trillion and which by 2030 is estimated to be $3.0 trillion. Coastal flooding and storm surge risk are also related to water below ground in terms of storage, drainage, and flow. For much of Florida's porous limestone geology, seawater intrudes into the bedrock along the coast. Sea level rise has the potential to exacerbate the landward advancement of a wedge of seawater that underlies a coastal aquifer. Groundwater is pushed higher towards the land surface as it floats above the denser and thus deeper saltwater. Sea level rise allows the existing wedge of seawater to further protrude inland impacting the aquifer. The lens of freshwater is pushed inland, threatening coastal well fields with contamination from saltwater intrusion. In addition, groundwater elevations increase as the lens floats above the saltwater. Figure 7 illustrates this process of aquifer variability, which causes a threat of inland flooding as the capacity of the ground to absorb and store storm water is reduced. The Florida Peninsula is a porous plateau of karst limestone, known as the Florida Platform (Florida Geological Survey, 2001;USGS). In areas with coastal aquifers, the flow of water is intimately connected between surface and groundwater, between seawater and freshwater. The Florida Platform edge is defined as where the water depth is at 300ft, beyond which the sea floor plunges to depths which may exceed 10,000ft (Figure 8). On the west coast, the Platform extends 100 miles west of Tampa, while on the east, it drops off 3-5 miles seaward of Miami. The multilayered Floridan aquifer system extends to four other states, and provides water for large cities including Jacksonville, Tallahassee, Orlando, and St. Petersburg (Figure 9). The Biscayne aquifer, overlying the Floridan Aquifer to the south supplies water to cities including Miami and Fort Lauderdale ( Figure 10). The sponge-like limestone bedrock that underlays much of the Peninsula serves many beneficial purposes, particularly related to water supply and water quality. However, as explained, it also presents vulnerabilities related to rising seas. Saltwater intrusion threatens coastal potable well fields and groundwater lifting increases the risk of seasonal flooding. Inland areas that are not hydrologically connected to the coastline are still vulnerable to the risk of increased groundwater flooding. Areas inland of gravity driven flood control structures are also vulnerable as drainage infrastructure experiences compromised functionality at higher ocean levels."}, {"section_title": "Addressing Future Coastal Hazards", "text": "Florida's coastline is a transition zone for unique natural ecosystems: marine, coral reefs and oyster bars, shellfish beds, sea grass beds, barrier islands, bays, estuaries, lagoons, beaches, and wetland habitats. As shoreline habitats overlap with the human built environment, there are challenges to maintaining both of these competing coastal environments. Yet there are also opportunities to nurture the balance between the unique mosaic of ecosystems and the diverse population, public infrastructure, private property and economy in Florida. Many of the State's natural resources have historically served to buffer storm waves, filter pollutants, and facilitate habitat migration. There are innovative solutions to coastal hazards that both protect ecosystems and leverage ecosystem services for protection.

For a useful description of the ways in which coastal flood hazard tools serve different functions and capabilities, Natureserve provides one of the best explanatory reports. In their report, tools are defined as falling in one of three classes: visualizer, model, and decision-support. Based upon a tool's class and features, it can serve to assist planners to engage stakeholders, scoping/ inventory, assess/analyze, plan, and implement. This section presents an overview of data and tools in Table 2, and progresses into some greater detail via the following paragraphs.  CRiSTALhttps://www.iisd.org/cristaltool/ So as to convey a fuller understanding of some of the tools presented above, this section will provide greater detail on six of the tools. The tools surveyed in greater detail below were created by experts at national institutions such as NOAA, Universities such as the GeoPlan Center Sketch Planning Tool, or are exemplary efforts by non-profits, such as the Nature Conservancy visualizer. Readers may utilize these resources to develop a very good understanding of coastal flood hazards in their community either before or during outreach to stakeholders. NOAA's Tides & Currents page plots long term mean sea level trends for the lifetime of tide gauges around the country. For example, the sea level trend at the Pensacola, Florida gauge station is illustrated below. NOAA's webpage also allows users to plot long-term and shorter term tide trends 6 , to explore trends through the creation of corresponding maps 7 , and to view future tide predictions 8 . NOAA's Digital Coast 9 page provides data, tools, training, and stories. LIDAR Elevation data for Florida's entire coast is available to download, or it can viewed using the Sea Level Rise Viewer Tool 10 . The tool is unique in that it distinguishes between inland and coastal low-lying areas, it can display confidence, flood frequency, socioeconomic vulnerability, and marsh impacts and potential migration. Another NOAA tool is the Coastal Change Analysis Program Coastal Comparison Tool 11 , which allows users to compare land cover data (8 classes) for an individual county to the respective surrounding coastal region over a given period of time (1996,2001,2006,2010). A tool that is provided by the Nature Conservancy is the Coastal Resilience 12 mapping portal. While currently only available for some parts of Florida, the tools is continuously expanding the available spatial extent of coverage. There are a variety of layers that can be explored, such as FEMA repetitive loss properties, landuse, and habitat. The \"Coastal Defense\" application allows the user to visualize and quantify how coral reefs and mangroves can provide coastal protection in relation to increasing wave heights. Future habitats under various sea level rise scenarios may be graphed as well for a specified area.

Still-water (or \"bathtub\") models are coarse approaches that use water level and topographical data and apply sea level rise scenarios at constant elevations but do not include other factors such as erosion, tide, storm surge, wave dynamics, landform responses, or interaction with stormwater management systems. Maps generated from these models provide the basis for applying the sea level rise scenarios to assess potential extent and severity of flooding. While they have many limitations and should not be used for site-specific analysis, bathtub models are useful for visualizing potential extents of future high water levels for initial consideration of vulnerabilities."}, {"section_title": "Working with Storm Surge Data", "text": "Storm surge occurs when a low pressure storm system moves over a body of water, pushing the water towards the shore with powerful winds. The highly elevated water levels that result as storm waves pile up and move inland can cause severe damage to both the natural and built environment. Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH) is a model that integrates the effects of storm surge and accretion (i.e., sediment deposition). Figure 13 depicts storm surge exposure modelled for South Florida. As can be seen, much of the region is vulnerable, even to a Category 1 storm (shown in red). Sea level rise permanently increases the average height of the ocean upon which surge builds. National Weather Service's SLOSH model can applied to simulate the impact of projected changes in sea level on inundation. The linear method typically used adds sea level rise to SLOSH results (Frazier, Wood, Yarnal, & Bauer, 2010;Kleinosky, Yarnal, & Fisher, 2007;Shepard et al., 2012;Wu, Yarnal, & Fisher, 2002). The current designation for storm surge risk in Southeast Florida is the Coastal High-Hazard Area (CHHA), which is standardized as the category one storm surge zone modelled by SLOSH. In lieu of contracting to have sea level rise incorporated into existing SLOSH models for adaptation planning purposes, communities may consider choosing to use current (2014) higher storm surges (Category 3) as a best-available proxy for a Category 1 storm surge with 1 foot of sea level rise during future (2050) storm events. By utilizing one of the tools and methods suggested in this section, a community may equip itself with the best available data for projecting sea-level rise and associated coastal flooding. The Adaptation Action Areas pilot (see Appendix 1: Case Studies) provides further detail on how a specific projection was selected for the City of Fort Lauderdale."}, {"section_title": "Uncertainty in Projections", "text": "Uncertainty in projections refers to the assertion that, as models simulate scenarios further and further into the future, the range of values required to satisfy the same confidence that the projection is accurate must increase. This translates to a wider range of heights for projected sea level rise in 2100 compared to the range of heights projected for 2020. The Southeast Florida Regional Climate Change Compact Unified Projection ( Figure 14) uses historic tidal information from Key West and was calculated by Kristopher Esterson from the USACE using USACE Guidance (USACE, 2009) intermediate and high curves to represent the lower and upper bound for projected sea level rise in Southeast Florida. As shown in Figure 14 below, there is increased uncertainty in projections as the planning horizon is extended. Uncertainty is present in sea level change projections because of the uncertainty inherent in the forces that drive these systems (for example, rate and magnitude of sea level rise, changes in storminess, changes in daily tide range) and the future evolution of coastal landforms (examples include barrier island over wash, migration, and man-made alterations). In identifying and prioritizing areas for targeting infrastructure improvements, the Department of Transportation has found the need for establishing a planning horizon that exceeds the year 2060. The Compact is currently meeting to extent projections to 2100. The key to progress among uncertainty is the collaborative agreement on the projections and the commitment to revisit projections as new scientific data develops. The Compact plans to meet in the next year (2015) to review and modify the unified projection, with the specific goal to set a planning horizon for 2100.

The approach to adaptation planning for sea level rise described here is a series of steps a community takes, not just to adapt, but to holistically become more resilient to the impacts of sea level rise. Informed decision-making has the potential to lead to safer, more responsible, economically sound communities. Regional or local asset inventories will be valuable in determining local impacts. Sea level rise scenario mapping can be used in conjunction with a key asset list developed by local experts and stakeholders to determine vulnerable assets of concerns.  2013provides numerous categories and computations through which a hazard assessment can be developed. Section 3.2.2, Hazard Profiling, sets forth nine hazard impact areas. Impact categories 2, 6, 7, 8, and 9 are applicable to the one or more of the assessment projects proposed by this guide: \uf0b7 Impact on Public: based on historical observation and demographic information and study, how the type or level of hazard would affect the general public and their daily lives. \uf0b7 Impact on property, facilities, and infrastructure: based on historical observation, study and modelling, how the type or level of hazard would affect county facilities, critical infrastructure, and other structures. \uf0b7 Impact on delivery of services: based on historical observation and study, how the type or level of hazard would affect the public or private delivery of essential services to the affected or neighboring population. \uf0b7 Impact on the environment: based on historical observation, study and modeling, how the type or level of hazard would affect the environment, and associated affects that could cause (e.g., debris). \uf0b7 Impact on the economic condition: based on historical observation, study and modeling, how the type or level of hazard would affect the economic success and viability of local, state and national enterprises, and longer-term impacts to supply chain, or commodity requirements. Historical observations of flooding may inform the description of sea-level rise and storm surge prone areas according to earlier accounts of flood effects on people, property, facilities, the delivery of services, the environment, and economic changes in the area. \uf0b7 Probability of the hazard occurring in the jurisdiction; \uf0b7 Potential magnitude and severity of the hazard in the area; \uf0b7 Size of the population at risk in the jurisdiction; \uf0b7 Growth and development trends for the jurisdictions, especially in areas that are affected by the hazard; \uf0b7 Existence of large populations with special needs such as the elderly, the poor, and the non-English speaking communities; and, \uf0b7 Critical facilities and infrastructure that are vulnerable to the hazard. Akin to the hazard profiling bulleted list, the Local Mitigation Strategy bullets emphasize the importance of measuring special needs populations, growth trends, and critical infrastructure in hazard exposed areas.

Since focus areas may act as the precursor to the official Adaptation Action Area, they can be defined on a map according to the following characteristics: \u2022 A specific geographic area (i.e., development along coastlines); \u2022 Certain vulnerable populations or communities (i.e., the elderly and climate-related health risks); \u2022 Natural and built systems (i.e., local stormwater drainage systems and infrastructure); and/or, \u2022 Other assets identified and quantified during the Impact Analysis.

Response options are evaluated for their feasibility and potential effectiveness at reducing the identified risk(s). Available academic research and case studies from practitioners pointedly acknowledges that adaptation planning may prove challenging due to adaptation barriers such as political impediments, institutional restrictions and resource limitations. However, resilience is becoming a necessary and sought after planning process for many coastal communities. Figure 15 supplements the text descriptions, and can be found on page 48. The implementation of Adaptation Action Areas allows communities to gradually plan for adaptation to current and future sea level rise and other potential impacts. The four optional strategies (protection, accommodation, retreat and avoidance) of adaptation provide an avenue for communities to address the four major impacts of concern (refer to page 29). Protection strategies may be targeted for areas of a community that are location-dependent and cannot be significantly altered or relocated, such as downtown centers, areas of historical significance, or waterdependent uses. Protection includes shoreline armoring that is either natural or man-made. Examples include: seawalls and bulkheads, beach nourishment, living shorelines, tide gates and saltwater intrusion barriers. Accommodation strategies aim to reduce potential risks rather than seeking to prevent flooding or inundation entirely. Examples include: the flood proofing of nonresidential structures, vertical elevation of structures; using structural fill to raise grade elevations; build bridges to have higher vertical spans; limit development in projected hazard zones; planting salt water tolerant plant species, and, recommended increased setbacks for new or substantially improved development activities. If a critical facility in a high risk area requires substantial upgrades, it might be cost-effective in terms of hazard avoidance to relocate the facility. Managed Retreat or Relocation strategies may involve the transition of vulnerable lands from private to public ownership, but may also include a combination other strategies such as transfer of development rights (TDRs), purchase of development rights, rolling and conservation easements. Examples include: publicly lead amendments to future land use plans; adoption of rolling easement policies; infrastructure relocation/removal; and, transfer of development rights to upland sending areas that are characterized by lower vulnerabilities to coastal hazards. Avoidance strategies may involve identifying opportunities for future conservation or low density development areas within local government planning documents. A wide range of planning tools may be identified, facilitating a local decision to limit development in areas subject to moderate to high risk. Regulatory tools may include the designation of lands for low density or passive uses. An avoidance strategy may include land acquisition or tools such as a land trusts, zoning codes, and overlay zones. These categories have numerous supporting options that can be applied in community-specific settings. Whereas one community may be able to implement more avoidance measures to protect people and property from future flooding, another may find greater benefit from soft structurally defensive measures.

A Transfer of Development Rights (TDR) program is a market tool a community can use to achieve land preservation by allowing one landowner to sever development rights (the \"sender\" or sending lot or area) in exchange for compensation from another landowner who wants their development rights to increase (the \"receiver\" or receiving area). The receiving area is allowed to have increased intensity or density. The program shifts development from resource sensitive areas to locations with full municipal services. A coastal community could establish a voluntary Adaptation Action Area TDR program to provide incentives to landowners to develop at higher densities in environmentally non-sensitive and low-risk areas upland with a mix of uses in very low risk areas outside a designated Adaptation Action Area. The efforts of such a program would be considered a retreat strategy as a community would be directing development away from the coastal, high-risk areas. Communities may wish to develop a statewide or regional sea level rise TDR program with a surplus of receiver site options to provide property owners more incentive to participate. A TDR program is an incentive that can be used to compensate an owner for giving up the right to develop portions or all of a property. Incentives are often viewed by property owners as a fair way to limit development since he or she receive something in return for any lost privileges. In order for these types of programs to work, development permits must be high demand and limited. If someone can more easily secure a permit through normal channels, there is no incentive to go through a TDR program to secure density bonuses. TDR programs can be mandatory or voluntary. Mandatory TDRs have pre-designated sending and receiving areas and the sending area's development potential is automatically downsized. In voluntary TDRs, the landowner has the option to receive payment for their transferable development rights. Mandatory TDR programs can help avoid the constitutional takings constraints of down zoning, and possible claims under Florida's Bert Harris Act if the affected property owners in the sending area can be assured of an adequate compensation for their lost development rights through creation of a development credit bank or exchange. Transaction costs, however, can be substantial, especially when a development credit bank or exchange is established. In addition, the high value of some land in vulnerable areas (i.e., along the coast) makes tradeoff to less vulnerable areas (perhaps inland) difficult because of a difference in land values as a function of aesthetics, amenities and demand."}, {"section_title": "Yankeetown Transfer of Development Rights", "text": "Yankeetown established a Transfer of Development Rights (TDR) program in the Town's Comprehensive Plan. This program has the opportunity to be expanded to include areas that are vulnerable to coastal change impacts, such as Adaptive Area One. The benefits of a TDR program include the ability of a local government to decrease intensity and density standards while conserving and/or protecting threatened properties in areas vulnerable to sea level rise. In addition, TDRs may help governments avoid large expenditures on preservation by acquisition as a market for development rights opens up. The areas that are allowed additional intensity and density are usually infill development areas that have existing infrastructure. Disadvantages of TDRs may include uncertainty. As discussed previously, because some TDR programs are inherently voluntary, one cannot be sure which landowners will participate and how many acres will be preserved. This is true for most land preservation programs to varying degrees-purchase of development rights programs can also be voluntary-but uncertainty seems especially salient for TDRs. More development may occur than there otherwise would have been. Some parcels that would have stayed undeveloped even without a TDR program may have their development rights transferred and used on another parcel. Programs can be complicated to design and implement, and may take a good deal of ongoing analysis and management to be successful. Despite all of these challenges, broad stakeholder participation throughout the TDR planning process has led to several successful examples across the state."}, {"section_title": "Advantages", "text": "Disadvantages Although not currently widely used, this tool is within a local government's zoning authority.

Most of the rights transferred to date have come from the middle and lower Keys and have gone to receiving areas in the middle and upper Keys where they are used to supplement allowable densities for single-family residential subdivisions and allowable floor-areas for commercial development. The City of Palmetto uses density transfers to protect wetlands. Developers are allowed to increase development densities on the upland portions of their sites at the rate of one unit per acre for every four acres of wetlands that remain undeveloped. The City of Tallahassee's Environmental Management Ordinance encourages density transfers on sites situated within areas zoned as conservation and requires them in areas zoned as preservation. If there is no room for density transfer, development is allowed only at very low densities. Transfer of density potential could be combined with land acquisition in which the local government acquires ownership of the land and transfers the development potential to the former owner elsewhere in the same municipality. Owners of coastal properties may resent land use limitations or decreased densities if they perceive no imminent risk. Density transfer may provide a less costly alternative to land acquisition. As a voluntary undertaking, the transfer of development potential may not prevent the development of areas at risk from coastal hazards. In addition to land value, owners may be compensated for previous construction that hold structural value.

In addition, the 2010 Florida Building Code, Building (see Chapter 16) requires a freeboard for most structures developed in a 100-year flood zone). This can provide incentives to homeowners and business owners who develop or redevelop structures above the minimum requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).

The use of setbacks and buffers not only serves to protect and extend the life of structures and their inhabitants, but can provide protection and preservation of coastal wetlands, estuaries, beach dunes and state beaches; allow for inland migration of habitats; and serve as alternatives to hard-and soft-armoring. They can be applied as short and mid-term solutions for sea level rise impacts. A coastal community who wishes to use these regulatory tools may establish setbacks and/or buffer area policy based on a projected shoreline position that assumes specific increases in sea level or erosion rates over the life of the structure. Within a designated Adaptation Action Area, a community could create policy to: \uf0b7 Establish mandatory construction setbacks to a specified distance from the seawall, mean high water line or applied to only those properties within the Coastal Construction Control Line (CCCL). \uf0b7 Establish erosion-based setbacks requiring the structure be set back by the projected shoreline position over a specific time frame if appropriate (could either be based on a sea level rise projection or determined by the life expectancy of the structure). \uf0b7 Establish a tiered setback system that would allow for varying setbacks based on the size and risk of a structure determined by the annual average rate erosion over a specified number of years. \uf0b7 Limit the development on a property if sufficient setback requirements cannot be met. \uf0b7 Designate coastal buffer zones in areas that have existing important natural resources and/or could be part of a mitigation corridor as shorelines erode or tidal habitats shift. \uf0b7 Expand existing green buffer areas that are experiencing significant erosion or increased inundation. \uf0b7 Reduce property exposure to erosion and storm damage through shoreline vegetative buffers.

Communities may implement this planning tool as soon as possible \"in order to set property owners\" expectations for the value of their property. Minimum lot sizes and \"savings\" clauses can also be used to avoid takings challenges. However, when structures are built seaward of the setback line due to a variance or permit, it should be clear that the owner takes on the financial risk and that no public funding will be provided for future relief or rebuilding (Siders, 2013). It is important to note that these and similar examples are for illustrative purposes only, and communities may experience or develop different scenarios throughout the state based on individual vulnerability assessments."}, {"section_title": "Building Codes and Site Design Standards", "text": "Building codes and design standards are regulatory tools that establish the minimum requirements for building construction to maximize their capacity for safety. Building codes generally include the standards for structure, placement size, usage, foundations, floor assemblies, roof structures, energy efficiency, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, site drainage and storage, fixture standards, occupancy rules, parking rules, traffic impacts, fire code, and requirements for resistance to extreme weather events in disaster prone areas such as earthquakes, hurricanes, tornados and flood events. Under the Florida Building Code Act, the Florida Building Code officially replaced all local codes on March 1, 2002. However, local governments are permitted to adopt more stringent provisions where local conditions warrant. Other regulations governing building construction include flood protection regulations pursuant to the NFIP and the state Coastal Construction Control Line permitting standards (CCCL). Applications of particular interest to hazard mitigation are provisions governing a structure's resistance to wind-borne debris and standards for elevation and flood-proofing. A coastal community could elect to establish a local amendment to the Florida Building Code to extend flood resistant building code standards to currently unregulated areas that may become vulnerable to flooding in the future, such as the 500-year floodplain discussed previously. Within a designated Adaptation Action Area, a community could create policy to: \uf0b7 Require two or more feet of freeboard for structures located in tidally influenced floodplain; foundations that are more resilient to erosion and wave impacts; and/or flood-resilient construction materials in new development and redevelopment projects. \uf0b7 Encourage the use of strategies in new development and redevelopment projects to maintain the form and function of natural resources, such as incorporating vegetative buffers or natural water feature (wetlands). \uf0b7 Delineate the minimum technical and safety requirements for the design and construction of residential and commercial structures that are vulnerable to sea level rise impacts. \uf0b7 Require that all structures meet the flood resistant construction standards provided in the Florida Building Code (Building, Sec. 1612; Residential, Sec. 322). In order to fund implementation of these actions, the local jurisdiction could develop policies to prioritize the pursuit of financial assistance, such as FEMA's Hazard Mitigation and Flood Mitigation Assistance grant programs: to 1) retrofit homes that have been repetitively damaged by flood, elevate structures, move structures, or demolish damaged homes; and, 2) retrofit structures to reduce or eliminate the long-term risk of flood damage. The key advantage of this tool is its ability to deny approval of building permits of certificates of occupancy until the hazard risk has been addressed. However, permitting comes relatively late in the development process. This can be a concern if a property owner is not aware of any potential risk and only finds out when a building permit application is submitted. Outreach and education can alleviate this disadvantage. Floodproofing strategies such as structural elevation (raising the habitable areas within a building; or raising the entire building by using stilts/piles/columns, foundation walls or similar elevating structures) and placement of fill have limitation within the building codes. The NFIP, ASCE-24 (Flood Resistant Design and Construction (2010)) and the 2010 Florida Building Code prohibit the placement of fill for structural support in V-zones (wave velocity zones).

Such regulations include elevating structures to or above the design flood levels and anchored to withstand wave action in 100-year floodplain areas (known as A-Zones and V-Zones). X-Zones represent the 500-year floodplain and adoption of minimum regulations for these zones is not mandatory for participation in the NFIP, but instead encouraged and incentivized for communities participating in the Community Rating System (CRS). FEMA, who administers the NFIP, is responsible for working with local communities to develop Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs). The maps are created using only historical flood data, and do not currently account for projected sea level rise impacts, which are expected to increase flood risks outside of existing coastal zones. However, under the Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012, Congress directed FEMA to form a Technical Mapping Advisory Council that will provide recommendations for updating flood hazard mapping guidelines to incorporate future risk assessments, including the impacts of sea level rise. Floodplain regulations are a regulatory tool that a coastal community could amend to impose additional limitations (i.e., higher standards) on development in floodplains above the NFIP minimum standards, such as \"use\" restrictions within the 100-year floodplain areas (only allow limited residential, recreational, or agricultural uses), and/or impose design requirements in the 500-year floodplain areas that are currently not required (elevation requirements).

Over time, this will allow a community's existing building stock to gradually become more resilient to hazards.

Land Readjustment Strategies are assemblages of platted lands from which private owners voluntarily contribute property in exchange for equal or greater value in compensation or in share of the community's urban re-design outcome, allocating modified land parcels located as close to the original sites as possible. Compared to eminent domain, land readjustment may be considered a more friendly approach to adjusting property relations in land assembly . For Florida, the strategy may be applied to rearrange communities in a way that enhances flow, ensures drainage, and reduces flooding. One disadvantage of this strategy is that for a community wide redesign, all residents must be willing to accept adoption of the full redesign plan. All residents will also likely need to be both temporarily (during transition) and permanently relocated as the community is reconstructed in a resilient way. To ease the process of land readjustment, Hong & Needham (2007) recommend three conditions: 1. Have a consensus on the exchange value of property before assembling land. This could avert holdouts. 2. The land readjustment agency should avoid making the exchange value (the value at which the property is taken into the pool) negotiable. Instigated property change through land readjustment may reduce, though not totally mediate, the problem of compensating owners for the loss of sentimental value of the property. 3. When owners return to newly modified property, they may build new houses that resemble the old ones.

In the context of sea level rise, planning today improves the preparedness and resilience of coastal communities for the potential rising tides of tomorrow. In 1972, there were limited planning codes and developmental regulations in Florida. Many large scale developments were being built without looking at impacts on the environment, water quality, transportation, and population densities. Occasionally, such developments were so large that their impacts crossed county boundaries and had regional implications. A series of growth management acts were adopted as the State recognized these issues and the need to standardize local government planning procedures and to align them at the regional and state level."}, {"section_title": "What Do Comprehensive Plans Consist of?", "text": "Pursuant to Florida's Community Planning Act ( \u00a7163.3177, Fla. Stat. (2011)), all counties and municipalities in the State are provided the authority to adopt a comprehensive plan and procedures to implement the plan. The Community Planning Act provides great latitude as to the content of the comprehensive plan and how the local government chooses to address the various issues raised in the comprehensive plan. Comprehensive plans are generally comprised of goals, objectives, and policies that are intended to guide the future development of a community covering at least the first 5-year and 10-year period occurring after the plan's adoption. There are minimum and optional elements which are subject to specific state statutory requirements and guidance. Local governments that adopt Adaptation Action Areas may consider a range of policies to improve resilience to coastal flooding. Florida Statutes ( \u00a7163.3177(6)(g)) further provides strategies to guide local governments: 1. Maintain, restore, and enhance the overall quality of the coastal zone environment, including, but not limited to, its amenities and aesthetic values. 2. Preserve the continued existence of viable populations of all species of wildlife and marine life. 3. Protect the orderly and balanced utilization and preservation, consistent with sound conservation principles, of all living and nonliving coastal zone resources. 4. Avoid irreversible and irretrievable loss of coastal zone resources."}, {"section_title": "Long term result", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Goals", "text": "5.

Direct the orderly development, maintenance, and use of ports identified in s. 403.021(9) to facilitate deepwater commercial navigation and other related activities. 9. Preserve historic and archaeological resources, which include the sensitive adaptive use of these resources. The State of Florida's \"coastal zone\" includes the area encompassed by the state's 67 counties and its territorial seas, and therefore the Coastal Management Element is critical. Communities that prepare a coastal management element address the Coastal High-Hazard Area, an area particularly vulnerable to the effects of coastal flooding from disasters (the area below the elevation of Category 1 Hurricane Storm Surge Line). Florida Statues ( \u00a7163.3178(2)(d)) provides further criteria for addressing hazard mitigation and safe population evacuation. These planning requirements are supported by the integration of Hazard Mitigation Planning and the Regional Evacuation Studies. 18 The comprehensive plan is an important planning tool for communities, as it is an advantageous place to incorporate adaptive strategies into a community's land-use decision-making framework. The associated implementation procedures established in a comprehensive plan may relate to land development regulations, environmental permitting requirements, and government funding protocols [or priorities]. All proposed and approved development in the community is reviewed for consistency with the comprehensive plan and its procedures. Florida statute also enables citizens to challenge local development decisions approved through local development review processes (e.g., zoning hearing boards)."}, {"section_title": "Identify Policy and Funding to Accomplish Goals", "text": "Adaptation Action Areas are about protecting existing infrastructure in the short term while using other mechanisms to reduce vulnerabilities and evolve communities in the long term. Funding can be prioritized for Adaptation Action Areas, reducing risk in the most cost efficient way. It is important to maintain a balance between the urgency of current risks and the foresight to plan for future impacts. Adaptation planning and action is incremental and relies on using the best available data at the time and on understanding the useful life of the investment. Consideration of all possible options and the related costs and benefits for each will allow for a \"no-regrets strategy\" to be designed. Local governments wishing to designate Adaptation Action Areas, can consider creating the policy framework within the Coastal Management Element of their comprehensive plan. In order to set the stage for designating Adaptation Action Areas, local governments may consider policy language which: \u2022 Recognizes the value of, and states the intent to, designate Adaptation Action Areas to improve the resilience of built and natural areas to coastal flooding and related impacts of sea-level rise; \u2022 Provides the criteria to consider when identifying areas of concern for potential designation; \u2022 Describes mechanisms the local jurisdiction may use to create the actual designation; and, \u2022 Possibly identifies potential funding mechanisms to implement the adaptation action needed. The challenge for coastal communities is going to be: (1) how to tailor traditional planning tools to the impacts and timeframe of sea level rise; and, (2) how these tools can be used to support the development of new, creative ways to also tackle sea level rise as a complex multi-faceted issue. It is also beneficial to design plans and tools in alignment with other local governments within the region. Local governments may consider infusing adaptation policies universally to all of their planning documents beyond the Coastal Management Element (CME) of a comprehensive plan. Policies can be linked to any or all of a plan's elements. For example, adaptation projects could be identified in the Five-Year Schedule of Capital Improvements within the Capital Improvements Element, or policies outlining specific coordination efforts can be adopted within the Intergovernmental Coordination Element. In addition, a coastal community's efforts to adapt the built environment to climate related impacts can be written to supplement the Florida Building Code, land development and zoning regulation, emergency management plans, local mitigation and post-redevelopment plans, water resource management plans, transportation plans, flood control and stormwater management plans, community redevelopment plans, and future visioning plans. Coastal communities may consider coordinating efforts with their respective regional Water Management District's plans, Metropolitan Planning Organization's Long Range Transportation Plan, applicable public school district's adopted five-year work plan, and applicable local and regional natural systems and park management plans, such as the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan."}, {"section_title": "Folding Results into Comprehensive Plan Amendments", "text": "Criteria for Adaptation Action Areas may reference the state statute for Adaptation Action Areas and identify more specific local concerns that fall within the state guidelines.

CDMP language on Adaptation Action Areas includes the following wording: (LU-3K). By 2017, Miami-Dade County shall determine the feasibility of designating areas in the unincorporated area of the County as Adaptation Action Areas as provided by Section 163.3177(6)(g)(10), Florida Statute, in order to determine those areas vulnerable to coastal storm surge and sea level rise impacts for the purpose of developing policies for adaptation and enhance the funding potential of infrastructure adaptation projects. The comprehensive plan amendment process has been streamlined at the state level to assist communities who wish to plan proactively for adaptation planning, amongst other activities. As such, an Adaptation Action Area may be easily integrated into the Coastal Management element after a community has engaged with the other activities suggested by this guide. Once a hydrologic connection to the coast and vulnerability to storm surge, high tides, and potential sea-level rise impacts have been considered by the community (see \u00a7163.3164, Fla. Stat.

This textbox lists some tips for addressing a wide range of issues, including transportation, facilities, and collaboration.

Alongside this focal document, \uf0b7 Consider the design life of affected transportation facilities and consider the planning horizon used, sea level scenarios, and adaptation strategies (i.e., 2060 may be sufficient for roads but 2100 is more in line with the design life of bridges, which is about 80 years)."}, {"section_title": "Considerations for Increasing Clarity of Plan Amendments", "text": "other community visioning processes and strategic planning efforts may welcome the inclusion of Adaptation Action Areas designation. This section discusses a number of other documents into which Adaptation Action Areas can be integrated. Integration of Adaptation Action Areas into other municipal plans, ordinances and land development codes can be approached in an incremental fashion, meaning the community and the planning team may integrate one Adaptation Action Area strategy or all strategies relative to a specific aspect of sea-level rise (e.g., infrastructure; open space), and then return to the integration process when convenient. In approaching the integration process, this guidebook recommends that communities consider the completion of a checklist of regulatory documents and update times so that Adaptation Action Area strategies may be adopted on a schedule that conforms to the community's existing or projected schedule of adoption and implementation activities. An example checklist is illustrated in Table 6 below and more extensively in Appendix 3: The Adaptation Action Area Checklist, on page 110. As shown by Table 6, options abound for a community to integrate Adaptation Action Area language and maps into other documents. Of the nineteen shown here, the Capital Improvements Plan (CIP) often draws its influence on project scheduling directly from the comprehensive plan, and may be the first place in which a community who wishes to integrate Adaptation Action Areas into the comprehensive plan will see strategies being addressed by monetary allocations. Readers will also recall zoning ordinances, building codes, and floodplain management from the Adaptation Strategies Toolkit section (see page 50). Because the designation of an Adaptation Action Area is flexibly written in Florida Statute, the benefits the Areas may confer relate to numerous mitigation and growth management tools already in existence to protect the welfare of community residents. Like the larger checklist in Appendix 3, this table acts as a management tool whereby community officials may keep track of the assortment of policy documents whose uses intersect along Adaptation Action Area lines. Although readers are encouraged to keep in mind the recommendations made in the \"Considerations for Increasing Clarity of Plan Amendments\" box on page 71, the authority of different plans to direct areas that the comprehensive plan may not address could entail several final integrations of the local Adaptation Action Area language. From the Fort Lauderdale Pilot integration activities, the community created an initiative to designate Adaptation Action Areas in the City's Strategic Plan: Press Play Fort Lauderdale. Then, upon conducting the adaptation planning activities set forth earlier in this guide, and having adopted it into the comprehensive plan, the language appears forty times in reference to infrastructure projects programmed in the City's Community Investment Plan. The box on page 74 illustrates further description of Fort Lauderdale's multipleplan coordination.

Objective # 2 from the Strategic Plan has since been incorporated into the City's Community Investment Plan (CIP) for 40 infrastructure projects. As different groups may be assigned Adaptation Action Area strategies to implement, they may also work toward a strategy's adoption into a regulatory document as part of the schedule of activities so that the strategy's implementation is multifaceted and reaches across the range of local policy frameworks. The implementation phase of Adaptation Action Area planning provides planning teams with exciting and immediate results: the integration of the Adaptation Action Area ordinance into municipal plans, codes or land development ordinances.

The tri-county area makes up the Southeast Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), the sixth largest in the United States. With over 170,000 residents, Fort Lauderdale is a destination location for over 10 million tourists that visit Broward County annually and spend close to $10 billion. In 2013, The City of Fort Lauderdale embarked on a journey of creating a policy framework for the designation of Adaptation Action Areas. On June 17, 2014, the City Commissioners voted unanimously to transmit a comprehensive plan text amendment to the Coastal Management Element which included a goal, objective and fourteen policies related to Adaptation Action Areas to the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity (DEO), for review. As the state's primary land planning agency, DEO is a key player in guiding and approving land use plans and amendments. The South Florida Regional Planning Council (SFRPC) was also a key player in facilitating the process. SFRPC is the planning and public policy agency which works with public and private leadership in the South Florida region to achieve a vision of the future. Fort Lauderdale's success is due largely to the City's approach, which consisted of a uniquely designed combination of: \u2022 Partnerships and Support -Fort Lauderdale and Broward County were engaged by DEO, in partnership with the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The SFRPC has documented the process through a wide variety of resources including videos, a Guidebook, and a Case Study for the pilot community of Fort Lauderdale; \u2022 Community Engagement -Continuous outreach via a diverse range of avenues allowed the City to gauge community concerns and ideas, as well as to inform residents about resilience opportunities; \u2022 Integration -The alignment of Adaptation Action Areas with the City's vision, strategy, budget, and planning fortifies all components; and, \u2022 Capacity Building -The City organized numerous staff training events to introduce new language and designs. A NOAA staff training event engaged staff in the importance these issues (for more information, see: http://collaborate.coast.noaa.gov/climateadaptation/Ft%20Lauderdale%20Florida%20Training). Throughout the process, the majority of residents and city staff were already aware of coastal challenges, as they have been experiencing tidal flooding, erosion, and other issues related to drainage and water management."}, {"section_title": "Sea Level Rise and Coastal Challenges in Fort Lauderdale", "text": "The immediate sea level rise impacts that Fort Lauderdale is currently experiencing include higher storm surge, higher tides, reduced storm water capacity, increased flooding, and saltwater intrusion. Over time, sea level rise vertically raises the foundation (or base water depth) which storm surge and extreme tides build upon. Fort Lauderdale has a significant amount of land that is at low elevations and already vulnerable to tidal flooding and storm surge ( Figure 20 and Figure 21). Saltwater intrusion is also a threat due to potential contamination of fresh water aquifers, deterioration of structural materials, and groundwater lifting. Sea level rise exacerbates the landward advancement of an intrusion of seawater that underlies the Biscayne Aquifer. The groundwater is pushed higher towards the land surface increasing the threat of inland flooding. As water seeps up from below the ground and saturates the soil, storage capacity is reduced. This is a unique threat that cannot be solved by traditional methods of shoreline protection. Saltwater intrusion can also contaminate coastal potable well fields. In the fall of 2012, Hurricane Sandy weakened natural and built coastal armory (i.e., seawalls) in the off-shore Atalantic Ocean areas of Fort Lauderdale, and one month later high seasonal tides coupled with a strong onshore wind resulted in severe erosion of the remaining beach. Man-made losses connected to the beach erosion included the collapse of a four blocks of State Road A1A, a seawall, sidewalk and a traffic signal mast arm. Fort Lauderdale shut down two lanes of traffic on the road as the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) began emergency repairs. The process for repairing A1A and restoring the beach both in the shortterm as well as the long-term was a collaboration among FDOT, the City of Fort Lauderdale, and Broward County. That same month, Fort Lauderdale hosted a community meeting attended by over 200 residents that came to voice their concerns and recommendations on next steps. Public opinion was considered during the design process, resulting in a new long-term design that was engineered to be resilient to a wide range of foreseeable coastal hazards. The four lanes were reduced to three, the setbacks were increased, and dunes were included. A new fortified seawall made of metal sheet pilings was driven 40 feet into the ground. The final design for the road was actually adopted by FDOT as a resilient prototype to use for all future repairs and updates to the entire length of State Road A1A, which hugs Florida's east coast. While the City has been well aware of the increasing threat of erosion as sea levels rise, this event prompted many city residents to consider balancing prioritization of shoreline protection against traffic and scenic vista concerns. With the City's distinctive vulnerability to coastal hazards, the City was also characterized by a number of welldeveloped capacities that made it an exemplary candidate for being a pioneer in adaptation. \uf0b7 Fort Lauderdale has engaged staff and elected officials that are committed to infusing sustainability into all aspects of the City; \uf0b7 Breaking down silos is crucial for success.

Fort Lauderdale has been carefully folding resiliency and adaptation into their Strategic Plan, Vision Plan, and Sustainability Action Plan. The City capital budget prioritization methods have shifted towards supporting the stated goals. The City's outreach includes an annual \"Neighbor Survey\", stakeholder interviews, town hall meetings with the Mayor and City Commissioners, Meetings-in-a-Box, and an interactive website (OurVisionFTL.com) complete with social ideation in the development of vision plan. There were also two key events during the Vision process, the Big Ideas Fort Lauderdale and the Neighborhood Summit in 2012, in which residents' advocated for the need to improve the city's infrastructure to protect against inclement weather and high tides. The annual Neighbor Survey results showed that most of the residents surveyed have observed coastal water levels rise or increased flooding since they have established residency in the city. This understanding of resident concerns, coupled with a strategic approach, gives Fort Lauderdale an advantage for proactive planning. Feedback from these events helped to feed into the Adaptation Action Areas process. Buidling from these interactions, a \"Climate Adaptation\" Open House took place during the development of the Adaptation Action Areas comprehensive plan amendment.

That means accommodating it where possible and fortifying the city against it where appropriate. It also means designing for the transitional edge where the water meets the built environment. Solutions for the surrounding properties focus on using elevations where parts of structures are raised to higher elevations and lower levels are designed for more passive uses that can be flooded and still retain value.

Many existing and potential plans can be leveraged to ensure that Adaptation Action Areas wording is so ingrained in policy that it will sustain turnover of managers and elected officials. The key pieces of advice that the Fort Lauderdale staff unanimously agreed upon were: \u2022 Make your policy language broad and flexible. Use adaptive management to keep short-term solutions flexible for a wide range of long-term scenarios; \u2022 As alignment with other plans is being organized, this gives room to address the intent of the policies; \u2022 If something doesn't work, the policies allow space to step back and try something new; \u2022 Be methodical and strategic about your choice of words in terms of jumping too far ahead; and, \u2022 When communicating about increased vulnerability, provide factual information and avoid negative language that may alarm constituents. Gradually progress from short-term solutions to long-term solutions over time. These incremental steps will ease the process and make goals more attainable. The extensive consideration of public opinion is advantageous, when presenting funding requests, as the request directly relates to priorities identified by engaged community members. Susanne M. Torriente, Assistant City Manager, says her best advice to other cities is to integrate Adaptation Action Areas into fabric of local government and the budget process. Take the new language and put it into existing government lingo. Susanne highlighted that integration is an ongoing process. In 2015, the City plans to revise their design standards for infrastructure to integrate climate resiliency and sustainability into planning, designing and construction. Susanne says, \"We aren't having the climate change debate -We see sea level rise happening now and we are dealing with it. We are local government. We are at the front line. We have to deal with these issues in a practical manner. We are creating the local government of the future to deal with the City of the future.\" The City of Punta Gorda The City of Punta Gorda's Adaptation Plan is a local initiative, with regional support, that addresses the same issues identified in Adaptation Action Areas legislation. The Plan is the result of a cooperative decisionmaking process that was used within the Charlotte Harbor National Estuary Program to address diverse resource management concerns in the 4,400 square mile study area. Led by the Southwest Florida Regional Planning Council (SWFRPC), the partnership engaged citizens, elected officials, resource managers, and commercial and recreational resource users, all committed to maintain and protect the watershed. The 2008-2009 plan used a vulnerability assessment to guide intensive and creatively coordinated communication with stakeholders and decision-makers. The resulting components led to specific implementation actions that were both effective and preferred by the community. The actions focused on facilitating natural habitats to increase resilience. The region was already building capacity by actions such as planning for hurricanes. The community opted for planned relocation in some places, and to build future infrastructure further inland. They also thought about which areas to armor, and whether armoring would be natural or artificial. SWFRPC's James Beever describes other changes, \"Today's mangroves become sea grass, and flatwood becomes salt marsh.\" The region plans to maintain productive through these changes via restoration and the building of corridors for habitat migration along this gradient. James has been a leader for the region's climate readiness planning and has led many projects that stemmed in part from the plan. These include several Comprehensive Plan amendments, mapping/modelling efforts, and resiliency strategies for nearby counties. Other cities have done similar work utilizing Adaptation Action Areas. The Towns of Yankeetown and Inglis Levy County and the Towns of Yankeetown and Inglis have taken on resilience by using Adaptation Action Areas. Their project used a unique approach to planning for coastal change. The social, economic, policy and geographic attributes of the urbanized areas were inventoried, and to analyze predicted coastal change, Sea Level Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM) model output for the area was provided courtesy of the Nature Conservancy. The results identify areas that are likely to experience the most intense coastal change due to future sea level rise. In response to the information produced by SLAMM analysis, the six proposed Adaptation Action Areas cover a variety of land-uses, each with a specific vulnerability, as shown in Figure 29. This includes the designation of Natural Resource Adaptation Action Areas, for which an ecological assessment was conducted and environmental monitoring continues to take place. Next steps included site visits and community workshops to consider various adaptive design strategies. These allowed for the establishment of project goals and objectives. A SWOT analysis was conducted to identify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats, and to consider how these traits could be best addressed for reaching goals effectively. The spatial asset analysis results were merged with the vulnerability analysis and the local vision to produce recommendations and planning options for each Adaptation Action Areas. Long-term adaptation strategies were considered based on both best available data and municipal considerations. The towns are considering implementation measures such as floodplain management, FEMA's Community Rating System, and changes in the comprehensive plan and land development code. For specific adaptation strategies, protection, accommodation, and retreat were considered, as shown in Table 7. For more information see www.ChangingLevyCoast.org.  Over one-half of the barrier island community of Satellite Beach is below 6 feet (1.8 m), and the city is already planning for seasonal flooding (Parkinson & McCue, 2010). Much of the Atlantic shoreline in this Brevard County area is classified as \"Critically Eroded\" by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection. A 2009 study found that based on the topography, there was a tipping point at 2 feet of sea level rise (see Figure 32), beyond which the flooding will create a hazard for many of the City's assets. The city has a volunteer citizen committee serving on the Comprehensive Planning Advisory Board which recommends plan revisions and updates. All of the efforts and research have brought Satellite Beach much closer to resilience. http://www.satellitebeachfl.org/Documents/CPAB%2010-28-13%20Agenda%20Packet.pdf https://southeastfloridaclimatecompact.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/mccue-protecting-paradise-v2.pptx How These Lessons Can Be Applied in Other Areas For Adaptation Action Areas strategies to be successful and sustainable, each strategy must be both wellestablished and well-received. The scientific fundamentals of sea level change can be difficult to understand; this is compounded with the delicate ways in which the conversation can be politically charged. To address these issues, it is important to choose messages carefully. A coastal community may create and manage a sea level rise outreach campaign (see also, page 19) to inform community residents and business owners of: \uf0b7 The potential impacts of sea level rise; \uf0b7 The initiatives and programs the community will be or has implemented to address said impacts (such as Adaptation Action Areas designations); and, \uf0b7 Develop a relationship and understanding of the community needs, including addressing vulnerable populations and health risks associated with sea level rise. It is essential to tell people what they can do with the information they receive. Education campaigns prove much more useful when linked with targeted action or behavior change. It's the \"why\" that then relates to the change that is aimed for. Thus, in addition to the scientific planning techniques discussed above (Chapter 3: Conduct a Vulnerability Assessment, page 29), the community case studies emphasize the importance of stakeholder outreach and participation. In 2012, The Federal Transit Administration, in collaboration with the American Public Transportation Association organized its third climate change adaptation workshop entitled: Getting on the Right Track: Real-world Approaches to Climate Change Adaptation (http://www.fta.dot.gov/sitemap_14677.html). Some objectives of this workshop were to shape ongoing and future transit adaptation assessments by exploring successful approaches, to develop strategies for mainstreaming climate considerations as part of a transit agency's standard operating procedures and to gather ideas to inform adaptation planning. Becky Lupes, from the Federal Highway Administration's Sustainable Transport and Climate Change Team, presented on \"Lessons Learned from Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment Pilots (http://www.fta.dot.gov/documents/Lupes_FHWA.pdf). The information box below (page 105) summarizes and adapts these findings to the present guidebook recommendations for adaptation planning. While sound science is integral to the adaptation planning process, the outreach and inter-group coordination aspects may prove to be the most difficult to organize. Through these case studies, the guidebook has endeavored to show that committees, task forces, and other groups have aligned with community officials and planning teams to build consensus and buy-in for Adaptation Action Areas and associated planning efforts. Communities just embarking on the process are encouraged to reach out to DEO or one of the case studies described above for additional information and support. TIMING AND PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS \uf0b7 Allocate more than one year for community outreach and planning. \uf0b7 Define study objectives and scope up front. \uf0b7 Who is the target audience? What products are needed? What level of detail is required? \uf0b7 Select and characterize relevant assets-so you don't spend time collecting data on assets you aren't going to study. DESIGNING YOUR APPROACH \uf0b7 Identify impacts of concern, and identify thresholds for impacts: o There are multiple approaches (see pages 34, 40). \uf0b7 Depending on specific objectives, geographies, available funding: o It's an iterative process. \uf0b7 Findings in one area influence data gathering or analysis in another. \uf0b7 It is not a linear, step by step process. \uf0b7 Increase emphasis on vulnerability rather than criticality. \uf0b7 Consider political factors. \uf0b7 Consider your objectives. \uf0b7 Consider how to piece together networks (e.g. transportation) in differing formats. MESSAGING \uf0b7 Focus on extreme events now and those being more common in the future: o \"What keeps you up at night?\" \uf0b7 Focus on solutions and asset management: o Emphasize strategies that work rather than always \"disaster\". \uf0b7 Use maps and pictures to share results."}, {"section_title": "g. Other strategies", "text": "Policy 3.1.3: Adaptation strategy options may include the designation of Adaptation Action Areas (AAAs). As per Section 163.3164(1), Florida Statutes, an AAA is an optional designation within the coastal management element of a local government's comprehensive plan which identifies one or more areas that experience coastal flooding due to extreme high tides and storm surge, and that are vulnerable to the related impacts of rising sea levels for the purpose of prioritizing funding for infrastructure and adaptation planning. b. Protection: Strategies that involve \"hard\" and \"soft\" structurally defensive measures to mitigate impacts of rising seas in order to decrease vulnerability while allowing structures and infrastructure to remain unaltered. Two examples are shoreline armoring and beach renourishment. Protection strategies may be targeted for areas of a community that are location-dependent and cannot be significantly altered or relocated, such as downtown centers, areas of historical significance, or water-dependent uses. (Adaptation Action Areas: Policy Options for Adaptive Planning For Rising Sea Levels, South Florida Regional Planning Council, 2013) c. Accommodation: Strategies that do not act as a barrier, but rather alter the design through measures such as elevation or stormwater improvements, to allow the structure of infrastructure system to stay intact. Rather than preventing flooding or inundation, these strategies aim to reduce potential risks. Are previous coastal hazards and disasters identified and mapped through historical information, existing plans and reports, scientific knowledge, and local knowledge? Are hazard probability, frequency, magnitude, and duration defined? Are coastal erosion and/or shoreline change identified as a hazard? Is sea level rise identified as a hazard? Are historic rates of sea level defined? Are conditions identified that could amplify the impact of a hazard, like storm surge inundation at a high tide or erosion rates on stabilized shorelines? Are maps used to define the spatial extent of coastal hazards? Such as: Does the community utilize impact fees, accommodation taxes or user fees to acquire properties in hazard areas? Does the municipality engage in dune and/or wetland restoration? Does the community utilize impact fees, accommodation taxes or user fees to pay for shoreline stabilization/restoration?"}]
