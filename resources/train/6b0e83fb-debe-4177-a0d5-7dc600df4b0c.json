Firms called integrators own processing plants, hatcheries, and feed mills, and contract with independent \"growout\" operations to raise their broilers to market weight.

The broiler industry plays an important role in several public policy issues: \u2022 Large animal feeding operations, including those raising broilers, are under increasingly strict environmental regulation by all levels of government; and \u2022 The broiler industry has dealt with poultry diseases and associated biosecurity issues for many years, while growing public awareness of such threats plays an increasingly important role in industry and public policy planning."}, {"section_title": "What Did the Study Find?", "text": "Other industries use production contracts, but the broiler industry is distinguished by the dominance of such contracts and the methods by which growers are paid. Almost all broiler growers' contracts base the compensation on how each grower's performance compares with that of others. Beyond that feature, however, contracts are far from uniform. Contracts can include other terms that tie base payments to actions that affect grower costs or that assign some expense or revenue categories to either the grower or the integrator. Contracts also cover a wide range of specifi ed durations, from just over a month to 15 years. Variations in contract design likely follow from differences in grower location, size, and type of broiler housing, but the wide variation in terms and payments makes it diffi cult for growers to evaluate contracts. The industry's organization has contributed to its commercial success. High rates of productivity growth, along with new product innovation, led to high growth rates for chicken production, domestic consumption, and exports. Growth in production slowed noticeably, however, after the mid-1990s. With slower production growth, investment in new housing also slowed. New housing embodies new technology, so slowing investment can hinder future productivity growth, unless older houses can be effectively retrofi tted with newer equipment. Integrators are requiring such retrofi tting for some operations as a condition of extending their contract. For newer and larger operations, integrators are offering contracts of longer duration to induce them to continue to invest in new technology. Broiler production is gradually shifting to larger operations, a trend common to most agricultural commodities. For operators of small broiler enterprises, off-farm income is the primary source of the household's income, and the broiler enterprise provides a modest amount of additional income. For larger operations, the broiler enterprise typically is the primary source of the household's income. As a result, operators of larger enterprises may be more sensitive to the income risks arising from energy price fl uctuations and contract settlements. Contract features may need to be redesigned to adjust for differing risk exposures faced by growers. Larger operations may realize scale economies in production, but they also concentrate poultry litter in localized areas. Litter is bedding material, such as wood shavings, sawdust, or straw, that is spread on the fl oors of broiler houses. When it is removed, it consists mostly of poultry manure, along with the original bedding, feathers, and spilled feed. In 2006, about 40 percent of used litter was spread on the farm's fi elds, while the rest was removed from broiler operations for fi eld application elsewhere or for processing. There was enough of a market for litter in 2006 to allow growers to sell about a third of the litter removed from farms, but farmers had to give away the rest or pay to have it removed. Litter disposal remains a major issue confronting the industry. Two ARMS versions collect fi nancial and production information for all types of farms, but other versions target specifi c commodities and collect additional information on production practices, fi nancial performance, and contractual relationships for those commodity enterprises. ARMS included a broiler version for the fi rst time in the survey conducted early in 2007, with a focus on performance during 2006. The survey's target population consisted of all operations that produced broilers for meat and had at least 1,000 broilers onsite at any time during 2006, in the 17 States that accounted for 94 percent of U.S. broiler production. Analyses in this report are based on responses received from 1,568 operations, out of 2,100 originally selected for the survey."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "This report describes the organization and economics of broiler production in 2006. Broilers, young chickens bred for meat, account for nearly all chicken meat and most poultry meat produced in the United States. 1 The broiler industry's processes are tightly controlled by fi rms called integrators, who operate processing plants, feed mills, and hatcheries, and who contract with farmers to grow broiler chicks to market weight. This report focuses on farms in the production or grow-out stage and their commercial relationship with integrators. 2 Broiler production grew rapidly for many years, fueled by powerful shifts in consumption patterns. In 1960, Americans consumed about 28 pounds of chicken per person, compared to nearly 60 pounds of pork and 65 pounds of beef (fi g. 1). Chicken consumption rose steadily in the ensuing decades, reaching 87 pounds per person in 2006, while per capita beef consumption remained virtually unchanged from its 1960 value and pork consumption declined. Increasing chicken consumption refl ected changes in consumer preferences, the introduction of many new chicken-based retail products, and declining relative prices for chicken. Between 1960 and 2006, poultry prices rose by 2.7 percent per year while prices for all food rose by 4.2 percent per year, according to the Consumer Price Index (CPI). As a result, retail poultry became cheaper compared with other foods, encouraging a shift to poultry. Other price data indicate that rapid productivity growth was at the heart of poultry's superior price performance. Prices for prepared feeds, the major input used by poultry producers, rose by 2.5 percent per year during the same period, but wholesale broiler prices rose by just 1.3 percent per year as the industry found ways to increase feed effi ciency. 3 Per capita consumption increases of 2-4 percent per year, when combined with U.S. population growth of about 1 percent per year, provided the industry with substantial increases in demand over a long period. International markets provided a third source of demand growth, with increased chicken exports accounting for about a third of the total growth in production during the 1990s. Table 1 divides the growth in production into three parts-expanded exports, population, and consumption-and shows how changes in each affected the industry's production growth. Overall production growth slowed sharply after 2000. While per capita consumption continued to grow at 1.9 percent per year, the contribution of population growth fell in comparison to earlier years and export growth fell sharply (table 1). Changes in exchange rates can affect the competitiveness of U.S. exports, and growth in foreign incomes can be an important force. In the near future, a declining dollar, combined with income growth in Asia, may boost export growth again. The Economic Organization of U.S. Broiler Production / EIB-38 Increases in total liveweight production have been realized from a rapid expansion of the total number of broilers produced and also from increasing the size of birds (fi g. 2). Annual slaughter volumes rose from 1.53 billion birds in 1960 to 8.84 billion in 2006, while average weight rose from 3.4 to 5.5 pounds. In turn, increased production meant spreading to new locations, attracting new growers in existing locations, and increasing the size of production facilities. Slowing production growth is also apparent in fi gure 2. Before 1995, annual slaughter volumes of birds grew at a 4.6 percent annual rate, but at 1.7 percent afterward, even as average weight continued to increase. Broiler production is organized in a distinctive manner. Most farms are linked to an integrator through a production contract, under which the integrator provides chicks, feed, veterinary services, and other inputs to the farmer, who grows the birds to market weight. Besides providing their own labor, farmers invest in specialized poultry housing (along with associated equipment), pay for any hired labor, and bear some or all of the cost of utilities. Because broiler housing is specialized and long-lived, the decision to produce broilers is a long-term commitment, and most producers have worked with their integrator for at least 10 years.

The Economic Organization of U.S. Broiler Production / EIB-38 Economic Research Service/USDA Integrators usually own hatcheries, feed mills, slaughter plants, and further processing plants-that is, they may be vertically integrated into all stages except for broiler production, where they rely on networks of growers assembled through production contracts. Integrators also contract with, or own, primary breeder companies that develop poultry breeding stock, and they contract with other farm operations to produce broiler eggs for hatcheries. Production contracts are used in turkey and egg production and have been adopted widely in recent years throughout the hog industry. They can also be found in some areas of crop and horticultural production. But production contracts cover almost all broiler production, while other commodities also use a mix of other arrangements. Production contracts in all commodities pay farmers for their growing services, not for the commodity. But the broiler industry uses a distinctive compensation arrangement. Farmers are most often paid on the basis of their relative performance, compared with other producers who deliver broilers to the integrator within a specifi ed time period, usually a week. Under a relative performance standard, all producers receive a base fee, but those who deliver more poultry meat for the number of chicks placed receive higher payments; differences in relative performance, therefore, are driven by differences in chick mortality and feed effi ciency. In turn, this type of contract shields producers from the common risks due to weather or input price fl uctuations that affect producers as a group, since payment depends on relative performance and not on the average performance of the group (Knoeber, 1989). Broiler production is geographically concentrated. Figure 3, drawn from the 2002 Census of Agriculture, shows where broilers are produced. The map clearly shows the concentration of production in Southeastern States and also shows how production is concentrated into dense networks within those States. Geographic concentration is driven by economies of scale in broiler production and slaughter, which encourage the growth of large facilities, and from the reductions in transportation costs for chicks, feed, and birds that can be achieved by locating processing plants, hatcheries, feed mills, and   1960 1965 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005  grow-out farms near one another. Pressures for geographic concentration are counter-balanced by the associated concentration of poultry litter, which can, in high concentration, create pollution risks to water and air resources, and by the risks from the contagious spread of poultry diseases within a network."}, {"section_title": "Challenges Facing the Industry", "text": "The industry's distinctive organization has been an important contributing factor to its productivity and output growth (Rogers, 1979;Lasley, Henson, and Jones, 1983;Knoeber, 1989). But the industry now faces several challenges. The post-1995 slowdown in production growth is matched by a similar slowdown in productivity growth, resulting in retail price changes for chicken that now look much more like price changes for all food items. 4 Slowing productivity growth will press profi ts and lead to searches for different organizational designs. While the industry's geographic concentration enables integrators to realize scale economies in production and processing, it also creates several risks and public policy challenges. For example, the worldwide spread of contagious poultry diseases is a growing concern and an important driver of industry biosecurity safeguards. But government agencies will also be involved in planning for and reacting to any serious outbreaks, and they need a deeper understanding of the industry's organization in order to carry out their responsibilities. Because production occurs in localized networks, growers in most areas have very few integrators from which to choose. Many growers have only a single integrator in their area and most have no more than three. The lack of alterna-4 Broiler prices rose by much less than feed prices between 1960 and 1995, as steady improvements in feed conversion offset the effects of feed price increases on costs. But broiler price changes have closely matched feed price changes since 1995, as improvements in feed conversion began to lag. In turn, retail poultry prices have risen at nearly the same rate as all food prices since 1995, after rising much less rapidly during 1960-95.   tives has led to controversy over production contracts and to legislative and regulatory proposals to regulate them. Finally, high geographic concentrations of broiler litter can create increased risks of water and air pollution from excessive applications of the nitrogen and phosphorous in litter. Concerns over those risks have led to expanded regulatory intervention, expanded funding under USDA conservation programs, and public and private sector searches for solutions. This report is designed to provide an overview of the industry's organization and economics, so as to provide objective and reliable background information. Our data are drawn from a large-scale representative survey of producers conducted early in 2007. The survey is part of the Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS), an annual survey of U.S. farms that serves as the U.S. Department of Agriculture's primary source of information on the fi nancial conditions and production practices of farm businesses and the well-being of farm households. ARMS has several versions. Two-a short version distributed by mail and a personally enumerated longer version-focus on all types of farms. Broiler operations do appear in those versions and some prior Economic Research Service (ERS) studies have used that data (Perry, Banker, and Green, 1999;MacDonald and Korb, 2008). Other survey versions (up to three each year), which are also personally enumerated, focus on producers of selected commodities and include detailed questions on commodity production practices, as well as contractual and marketing relationships. A broiler version was included, for the fi rst time, in an ARMS conducted in early 2007; the questions focused on performance during 2006."}, {"section_title": "Conducting a Broiler Version of the ARMS", "text": "The survey focused on commercial producers of broilers grown for meat. Therefore, a sample was drawn from a target population consisting of all operations that produced broilers for meat and had at least 1,000 broilers onsite at any time during 2006. The sample defi nition excluded operations that raise broilers for show or private consumption, as well as egg-laying, hatchery, and broiler breeder operations. To conduct the survey effi ciently, standard practice for commodity-specifi c ARMS versions is to limit the sample to major production States-in this case, 17 States that account for 94 percent of U.S. broiler production. 5 ARMS samples are randomly selected from a list of operations compiled from the Census of Agriculture, commercial databases, and USDA program databases. In June 2006, sample farms were screened for continued operation during ARMS survey Phase I. The questionnaire was fi nalized in November 2006, and survey enumerators conducted their interviews in February and March 2007. Of 2,100 operations targeted for interviews for the broiler version, 1,602 usable survey responses were received. Some respondents were still in farming, but did not produce broilers for meat during 2006, leaving 1,568 broiler producers for analysis (a 75-percent response rate). Most of this report focuses on the 1,546 operations that reported having a production contract for broilers (22 were independents, processor-owned, or did not respond to the question). To obtain more reliable estimates, some farms have a higher probability of sample selection. For example, larger operations are more likely to be selected for interviews than smaller, and selection probabilities also vary across geographic areas. Each sample farm represents a number of other farms from a similar geographic location and size class. These weights (the number of farms that each sample point represents) range from 3 to 40 farms. When sample observations are weighted to refl ect their varying selection probabilities, population estimates for production and other industry characteristics can be generated. The Economic Organization of U.S. Broiler Production / EIB-38 Economic Research Service/USDA"}, {"section_title": "How Production Is Organized", "text": "There were an estimated 17,440 commercial broiler farms in the 17 surveyed States in 2006, with production of 8.44 billion broilers (table 2). Since total nationwide slaughter amounted to 8.84 billion broilers in 2006 (fi g. 2), the data from this 17-State sample represent 95 percent of total production. Production contracts dominate the industry, accounting for almost all farms and broilers (table 2). The survey did identify a few independent operations (0.4 percent of birds produced) and some operations that were owned by processors (about 1 percent of farms). Respondents were also asked whether they produced certifi ed organic broilers or free-range broilers (\"free range\" is operator-defi ned and not necessarily organic). About 1.7 percent of operations were certifi ed organic (1.4 percent of broilers), while a smaller fraction (0.44 percent of operations) reported that they produced free-range broilers. Farms specialize according to the size of the bird produced; smaller broilers are used in the food service and restaurant trade, while the largest are cut into parts in processing plants. 6 The survey sorted production into four size classes according to weight at removal (fi g. 4). The most common, birds between 4.26 and 6.25 pounds, captured just over 40 percent of total production, measured by birds or by weight. The smallest class (4.25 lb. or less) accounted for 32 percent of all birds and 23 percent of all liveweight pounds produced in 2006, while the largest class accounted for 9 percent of birds and 14 percent of liveweight production. Over time, production has shifted to larger birds, refl ecting the growth of de-boned and further processed products. Large birds are grown in larger houses equipped with more modern climate controls. They also spend more time on the farm, and hence consume more labor, feed, utilities, and housing services, so producers of larger birds receive higher compensation per bird. 7"}, {"section_title": "Housing", "text": "Broiler houses are a major investment for growers. A single large house of nearly 30,000 square feet can cost $300,000, and most growers have multiple houses. Housing also plays an important role in the industry's productivity growth, as improvements in housing design and climate control systems can lead to improved feed effi ciency, lower bird mortality, and reduced costs of feeding, litter management, and bird removal. 6 Some farms did produce birds in more than one size class during 2006 (3.2 percent of operations), but most of those were switching from one size class to another. 7 Birds in the smallest size class (4.25 lb. or less) spend 39 days, on average, on the farm. The larger classes-4.26-6.25, 6.26-7.75, and 7.76 or more pounds-spend an average of 49, 56, and 63 days, respectively, on the farm. There were over 70,000 broiler houses in use for meat production in 2006. Their age structure follows a hump-shaped profi le (fi g. 5), with nearly two-thirds of capacity built in a 15-year period from 1986 through 2000. Investment dropped sharply after 2000, as considerably less capacity was built in the 6-year period from 2001 through 2006 than in any of the three preceding 5-year periods (1986-1990, 1991-95, and 1996-2000). The slowdown in new house construction mirrors the slowdown in the industry's growth (fi g. 6). Annual production of broilers grew by nearly 6 percent per year in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when measured by liveweight pounds at slaughter plants. Growth rates fell after the mid-1990s, to 2-3 percent per year in 2001-2006. As a result, far fewer new houses were needed to meet additions to production. 8 The diffusion of technologies in the industry can be traced by sorting houses according to vintage-that is, the year in which they were built (table 3). Houses have become steadily larger over time. Whereas the typical house built in the 1960s was about 12,750 square feet, recently built houses average over 20,000 square feet, and large houses built in 2005 and 2006 are much larger-up to 36,000 square feet. Most houses built before 2000 have side curtains-fabric that can be raised or lowered to help control the climate in a house with natural ventilation. While many recently built houses also have side curtains, they are more likely to have solid walls with equipment added for climate control. Two important types of climate control equipment are tunnel ventilation and evaporative cooling cells. Tunnel ventilation systems consist of large fans at one end of a broiler house and air inlets at the other end. The fans pull air through the house, removing heat from the building and creating a wind chill that provides further cooling. Evaporative cooling systems can be activated when tunnel ventilation alone fails to provide suffi cient cooling. The systems are located on the outside of the house near air inlets. Perforated pads in the systems are moistened, either through the use of fogging nozzles that spray water or through pipes that seep water through the pads. The 8 Newer houses can produce more birds from a given capacity than older houses because they have better temperature controls. Houses built between 2000 and 2005 produced about 8 percent more than the industry-wide average of 36.8 liveweight pounds per square foot, but the growth of new capacity still fell sharply after 2000, even when one accounts for this effect.  cooling pads then lower the temperature of the air as it is pulled through the pads and the house. Additional control equipment can be used to automatically monitor a house's temperature and humidity, adjusting the climate accordingly. About 75 percent of broiler houses had cooling cells and tunnel ventilation in 2006, and newer houses are much more likely to have them (table 3). Over 90 percent of houses built after 2000 had those features, compared with 70 percent of houses from the late 1980s and 50 percent from the 1970s. Older houses that have cooling cells and tunnel ventilation have probably been retrofi tted, with the equipment installed after the houses were originally constructed.

The survey asked respondents for the number of years that the operation had been producing broilers. Only 4.5 percent of farms, with 6.6 percent of production, produced broilers for 5 years or less (table 4). In contrast operations that, by 2006, had been in operation for 6-10 years accounted for 20 percent of farms and 23 percent of production. At the other end of the spectrum, about a third of all operations had been in business for at least 20 years. An operation's age has a strong connection to its housing and fi nances. Older operations are smaller with much older housing and technology. Many older operations have no debt, while those with debt carry much less, per square foot of capacity, than newer operations. New operations, in business for 5 years or less, have houses that are 11 years old on average, indicating that many recent entrants bought out existing operations with older facilities. Just under half of the new operations in table 4 also had new houses.

But because averages are infl uenced by a few very large operations, two other measures can also provide useful information on farm sizes. 9 The typical operation, as measured by the median (half of operations produced more and half less), produced 402,500 birds and 2.2 million pounds. While the typical contract broiler farm produced 402,500 birds in 2006, the typical broiler came from an operation that produced about 605,000 9 Broiler production resembles many other economic activities in this regard: most operations are relatively small, but a signifi cant amount of production occurs on a few large operations. birds (half of broiler production came from farms that produced more than 605,000 birds, and half came from farms with less). Using this last measure, production is shifting to larger operations over time. Hoppe et al. (2007) use Census of Agriculture data to show that this midpoint farm-where half of broiler production came from larger farms and half from smaller-was 520,000 broilers in 2002 and 300,000 in 1987, just about half the size of the midpoint broiler enterprise in 2006. We can also look at size according to the number of houses on an operation. Most are small: 70 percent had between 1 and 4 houses, and together they accounted for just under half of broiler production, while operations with 5 to 6 houses and operations with 7 or more houses each accounted for just over a quarter of production. The largest operations responding to the survey had 18 houses, although enterprises of that size are not common (table 6).

Debt, per square foot of housing, is reported for all farms, not just those with debt. Source: 2006 Agricultural Resource Management Survey, version 4, production contracts only. Although production is shifting to large operations, family farms still dominate. Integrators directly own farms that account for 1 percent of production. Among farms with production contracts, 88 percent are sole proprietorships (table 7). While corporations account for just over 10 percent of production, most are family corporations in which more than half of the stock is owned by people related by blood or marriage. Large family farms often seek to incorporate, and that pattern holds among broiler operations-35 percent of those with 13-18 houses are incorporated, compared with only 6 percent of those with 3-4 houses (table 8).   "}, {"section_title": "Production Contracts", "text": "Broiler production is a long-term commitment-houses are expensive, built to last for many years, and have few alternative uses. Because of that, producers tend to have long-term relationships with their integrator. On average, survey respondents reported holding contracts for 13 years with their current integrator. Actual contracts often specify very short durations (fi g. 7). Forty-fi ve percent of respondents reported that their contracts were fl ock-to-fl ock, explicitly covering only the birds currently in their houses (5-10 weeks). 10 But durations also range widely. Eight percent of production contracts specifi ed a term of at least 7 years, while the longest run 15 years. Long durations tend to be offered to newer and larger operations (table 4). Forty percent of recent entrants had long-term contracts (a specifi ed duration of at least 5 years) compared with only 6 percent of operations in business for at least 20 years. Among recent entrants, those with long-term contracts averaged half again as much production as those with shorter contracts."}, {"section_title": "Contracts and Competing Integrators", "text": "Because production is so localized, most producers have few integrators to choose from. Nearly a quarter (24.7 percent) reported that only a single integrator served their area, while another 28.7 percent reported two and 21.7 percent reported three. Those fi ndings may overstate the number of integrators farmers can choose among if some integrators are not actively seeking new growers. In the 2004 ARMS (version 1), we asked 545 respondents with broiler production contracts whether they had alternatives, in the form of other contractors, cash markets, or both, to their current contractor. Most (59 percent) responded that they had none-far more than the 2006 fraction reporting a single integrator in the area. The responses would be consistent Contract duration among broiler operations with one another if some integrators, particularly those in areas with 2 or 3, were not recruiting growers. Integrators will not necessarily be able to exercise market power, even if there are only one or two in an area, because the competition for growers depends on more than just the number of integrators in a market. Integrators must recruit growers away from other activities, such as producing other commodities on the farm or working off the farm. Those outside options for growers set limits on the degree to which integrators can impose low fees on growers. There is little empirical evidence, however, of the effects of integrator concentration on grower returns. Once a contract has expired, growers may have to retrofi t their houses with new capital equipment in order to gain a contract extension. These expenditures can be substantial. Between 2004 and 2006, farms spent a total of $650 million on capital improvements to their broiler enterprises, an average of $38,000 per farm. That average is skewed by a few large expenditures, but one operation in six spent at least $50,000 and another one in eight spent between $25,000 and $50,000. Retrofi tting is related to the age of the operation's facilities, and those with the oldest houses were much less likely to make signifi cant investments in new equipment (fi g. 8)."}, {"section_title": "Fees Paid in Production Contracts", "text": "Broiler farms are quite specialized and depend heavily on fees from broiler production contracts, which account for 85 percent of their gross cash farm income, on average (table 8). 11 In the hog industry, where production contracts are also used widely, contract fees average about 27 percent of gross cash income on farms with production contracts for market hogs. 12 Broiler contracts specify compensation arrangements, which usually depend on the grower's performance in raising chicks to market weight, with performance measured in comparison to other growers (table 9). Growers who deliver more meat, for the amount of feed and chicks provided, get rewarded 11 Gross cash farm income includes fees from production contracts, revenues from commodity sales through spot markets or marketing contracts, government payments, and income from other farm activities such as grazing, custom work or machine hire, and land rentals. 12 According to data from the 2004 ARMS hog version. Hog operations tend to have large crop enterprises.  under the relative performance design of contract compensation. In turn, that depends on feed effi ciency and mortality. Other factors may infl uence contract payments. Some contracts adjust compensation for energy prices, market prices of broilers, or local catastrophes. Furthermore, pricing schedules may vary across locations, depending on the amount of competition that an integrator faces in attracting growers. But relative performance has a powerful effect on compensation, and the strongest performers can be paid 50 percent more per pound than the weakest. Fees received under production contracts vary with the size of the bird produced (table 10). Operations that produce larger birds receive more per bird-37 cents, on average in the largest size class, compared with 20 cents in the smallest. But larger birds also cost growers more, because they have longer production cycles, thus using more energy, labor, and housing services. For that reason, fees are better analyzed on a per pound basis, where they average about 5 cents (liveweight), with average fees falling slightly as bird sizes increase. Because fees can vary widely with relative performance, the 10th and 90th percentile values for fees are also reported in table 10. This \"interdecile range\" captures the variation in fees around the average (10 percent of growers receive fees that are at or below the 10th percentile value, and 10 percent receive fees that are at or above the 90th percentile value). While average fees cluster around 5 cents per pound, fees at the 10th percentile can fall to 3 and 4 cents per pound (varying with bird size), while fees at the 90th percentile cluster around 6 cents per pound. Some of the variation may refl ect differences in relative performance among producers, but the variation can refl ect other elements of contracting as well. For example, integrators in some areas bear at least part of utility or litter expenses, and fees will be lower in those areas. Contracts may require growers to carry out certain production practices, and some of those requirements may affect grower costs and fees. The survey asked about several practices that related to testing of fl ocks for avian infl uenza, salmonella, and other pathogens (table 11). Few respondents (11.6 to 14.3 percent) asserted that such testing was not required, but many reported that they did not know (25.8 to 36.3 percent). Because some tests may be conducted by the integrator, the \"don't know\" response is reasonable and informative. Over 40 percent of operations reported that growth-promoting antibiotics were not used in their feed; in this case as well, it is not surprising to see a high fraction of \"don't knows\" (29.4 percent), since feed is provided by the integrator. Contract features related to compensation Eight-fi ve percent of growers said that production was carried out on an all-in all-out basis-that is, all birds were removed at the same time and all chicks were placed at the same time. All-in-all-out production limits the spread of disease and also allows operations to tailor feed mixes to birds of a specifi c age. Over 70 percent reported that their contractor required them to follow specifi c animal welfare practices, such as space standards per bird, while only 10 percent reported that they were not required to follow such practices. Two other practices were tied to food and poultry safety concerns. As of 2006, just over half of all operations were required to have a HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point) plan in place for food safety. And about a third of contracts required houses to be fully cleaned out, washed, sanitized, and dried after removal of each fl ock, while more than half did not. 13 The alternative, removing some or no litter after a fl ock is removed, with full clean-out occurring only after several fl ock removals, is less costly for the grower. Each approach seems to be widely used; about a quarter of respondents did not fully clean out any houses in 2006. 13 We also asked respondents whether they stored litter in their houses and, if so, whether they cleaned out their houses fully during 2006. About a quarter of respondents did not clean out any of their houses, although most of those crusted out their houses (removed some litter).  Production practices specifi ed in contracts "}, {"section_title": "Expenses on Broiler Operations", "text": "The size of the operation affects the form of broiler enterprise expenses. For example, large and small operations provide labor in different ways (table  12). In the smallest enterprises (1-2 houses), the primary operator reports providing the broiler enterprise with 25 hours per week, on average. For those with 1-2 houses, a broiler enterprise provides additional income, but it is unlikely to be the primary source of employment. Operator hours rise steadily with enterprise size to 35 hours per week (3-4 houses) and to 45 hours (9 or more houses) with some additional hours provided by spouses and other operators. Smaller operations use virtually no hired labor (table 12). In contrast, larger enterprises rely on considerable amounts of hired labor, which allows for greatly expanded production for a given time commitment by the operators. Among large enterprises, hired labor compensation amounts to 0.45 to 0.60 cents per pound or about 10 percent of average production contract fees. Utility expenses are the major cash operating expense faced by most growers, and amount to 1.1-1.2 cents per pound, a signifi cant cost when production contract fees average about 5 cent per pound (table 13). Electricity expenses vary from 0.36 to 0.41 cents per pound of meat produced, with no apparent advantage to larger sizes. Most growers spend more on fuels with expenses ranging from 0.6 to 0.8 cent per pound, although the largest operations realized noticeably lower expenses in 2006. Fuel expense can also be an important feature in contracts-three-quarters of the smallest producers received some fuel assistance from integrators in 2006, compared with 40 percent of the largest, with the incidence of assistance falling steadily as enterprise size increased. Assistance took two primary forms: reimbursement for fuel expenses or adjustment of compensation to refl ect seasonal changes in fuel prices. If energy prices continue to exhibit the wide variation seen in recent years, we can expect to see more such assistance, as well as efforts to redesign houses for greater energy effi ciency.  "}, {"section_title": "Litter Management Practices", "text": "Poultry litter is bedding material, such as wood shavings, sawdust, or straw, spread on broiler house fl oors. After being used, litter consists mostly of poultry manure, along with the original bedding, feathers, and spilled feed. The manure contains nutrients, including nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium, and calcium that can be used to fertilize cropland. Excessive applications of nutrients, however, can create environmental risks to water and air resources. Litter management, therefore, becomes an important issue. Farms may apply used litter to cropland or they can remove it to other farms or other uses. Most farms (about 71 percent) removed at least some litter from the farm in 2006, and a little over half of those removed all of it (table  14). In the aggregate, 61 percent of all broiler manure produced on farms in 2006 was removed and used off the farm. Thirty-six percent of the litter removed from farms was sold. Revenue from litter sales, about 0.2 cent per pound of liveweight production, therefore added about 4 percent to the operation's gross income for growers who could fi nd litter buyers. About 60 percent of operations applied litter to their own fi elds (table 14), and about half of those were able to fi eld-apply all of their litter. Thirtynine percent of all litter stayed on the farm and was applied to fi elds on the operation. For those that did so, survey responses indicated that about 1 acre of cropland was fertilized with litter for every 4,000 broilers produced (for average size birds). For an operation that removed 400,000 birds in a year, and aimed to fi eld-apply all litter, 100 acres would therefore be required, on average. 14 The Economic Organization of U.S. Broiler Production / EIB-38 Economic Research Service/USDA"}, {"section_title": "Farm Operators and Their Households", "text": "Farm operators make day-to-day management decisions for the farm. Until a few years ago, USDA surveys gathered information on only one operator (the primary operator) for a farm. But many farms have more than one operator, and ARMS now asks for the number of operators on a farm and a limited amount of personal information for up to three operators. The survey also gathers demographic and fi nancial information on the primary operator's household, because important farm business and household fi nancial decisions may be linked. We summarize operator characteristics for family owned and operated broiler farms in table 15 and compare them to operators of all family farms with at least $50,000 in gross cash farm income. Many farms, as defi ned in USDA statistics, are extremely small, with very little farming activity or income derived from farming. Almost all commercial broiler operations meet the $50,000 sales cutoff, so this cutoff was chosen as a useful comparison. The typical operator was a white male in his 50s whose formal education ended after completing high school (table 15)-much like other farm operators. Operators of broiler farms differed from other operators in two important dimensions: more of them were women and fewer of them had graduated from college. Eight percent of broiler primary operators were women, compared with just over 4 percent of all commercial farms, but this only captures part of the story. Most spouse-operators were women, and respondents usually report the male as the primary operator when a husband and wife each operate the farm. When we survey all operators of the farm, 54 percent of broiler farms reported having at least one female operator, compared with 36 percent of all commercial farms. Survey respondents were asked for the highest level of formal education that they completed and given four response categories-less than high school, completed high school, completed some college, and a college degree. More than 50 percent of commercial farm operators had completed at least some college education and less than 10 percent did not complete high school. Over 60 percent of broiler farm operators had no more than a high school diploma and 12 percent completed college, compared with 28 percent of all commercial farm operators.  "}, {"section_title": "Organizing the Information", "text": "The data are organized into three panels. The top panel provides information on broiler enterprise characteristics for the farms in each size class. The middle panel identifi es the operation's sources of gross income and then derives net farm income from gross income and operating expenses. The bottom panel shows how net income from the farm business fl ows to the principal operator's household. \"Small\" operations include broiler enterprises with less than 1.33 million liveweight pounds removed in 2006-the smallest 25 percent of operations. Most of those farms had 1-3 broiler houses and average production was 846,838 pounds. The \"medium\" class includes enterprises with between 1.33 and 3.30 million pounds removed (50 percent of all operations). Most of them had 2-5 houses. The largest 25 percent of broiler operations were divided into two equal-size classes because that group covered a wide range of enterprise sizes. The \"large\" class had between 3.30 and 4.49 million pounds of liveweight production, usually in 4-8 houses, while the \"very large\" had more than 4.49 million pounds of liveweight production. Some of the very largest operations had 18 houses, but the interdecile range (10th to 90th percentile) was 6-14. The four classes show distinct age patterns-small enterprises have older houses (24 years, on average) and older operators (60 years), while very large operations tend to have the newest houses and the youngest operators (table  16). Some farms, including a sixth of the very large operations, have multiple households sharing the net income from the farm, either because of partnerships or because some of the farm's equity holders are not part of the primary operator's household. We excluded those farms from the fi nancial analyses in order to simplify the analysis of farm business fi nances and the linkage to households. Exclusion has no substantive effect on the fi ndings presented in table 17, but it had some impact on the estimates in table 16. 15"}, {"section_title": "Net Farm Income", "text": "The middle panel of table 16 summarizes gross and net income for the farms. Gross cash farm income is the sum of fees from production contracts, revenues from cash sales and marketing contracts, government payments, and other farm income. Fees from production contracts account for most of gross cash farm income-70 percent in the small class, where some farms are diversifi ed into signifi cant production of other commodities and 80 percent or more in the other classes. 15 Mean values of two measures (farm business income to the household and farm income to the household) would be lower if we included operations with multiple households in the calculations. The Economic Organization of U.S. Broiler Production / EIB-38 Economic Research Service/USDA 1 Size classes are based on liveweight pounds removed. The small class (less than 1.33 million) included the smallest 25 percent of farms, the medium class (1.33 to 3.30 million) included the next largest 50 percent of farms, and the two largest classes (3.30 to 4.486, and over 4.486 million) each had an eighth of all farms. 2 The row labeled \"Broiler houses\" reports the interdecile range; for example, in the very large column, 10 percent of farms had 6 houses or less and 10 percent had 14 houses or more. 3 Includes income from land rentals, custom work, machine hire, grazing, etc. 4 Also includes changes in accounts receivable. 5 Includes the value of farm production consumed on the farm and the imputed rental value of the operator's on-farm dwelling. 6 Includes depreciation expense charged to farm assets and noncash benefi ts for farm employees. 7 The operator HH share is always 1.00 because nonfamily farms and farms with multiple households sharing in farm business income are excluded (8 percent of family farms have multiple households sharing farm business income). Note: HH refers to primary operator household. Source: 2006 Agricultural Resource Management Survey, version 4, production contracts only. Gross farm income combines gross cash farm income with noncash income. In turn, noncash income includes the net change in inventories and accounts receivable, as well as the imputed rental value of the operator's home if it is part of the farming operation. On average, farms in each class reported substantial increases (equivalent to 5-10 percent of gross cash farm income) in inventories and accounts receivable in 2006. Industry production continues to grow, and we would expect growing industries to exhibit growing accounts receivable. Farms with crop operations could also have kept some production in storage at the end of 2006, leading to increased inventories in anticipation of rising crop prices. Net farm income subtracts cash and noncash operating expenses from gross farm income, and net cash farm income subtracts cash operating expenses from gross cash farm income. Cash operating expenses typically amount to 60-67 percent of gross cash farm income and average depreciation expenses, which account for almost all noncash operating expenses, amount to 30-32 percent of cash operating expenses. Net farm income is the difference between gross farm income and operating expenses, and it amounts to 25-27 percent of gross farm income in each size class. Net farm income, however, varies widely among broiler operations, where a quarter of farms experience losses-negative net farm income. Poor productive performance may be one source of negative net income since, on average, operations with negative net farm income receive fees of 4.8 cents per pound, compared with 5.1 cent per pound for those with positive net income. Depreciation is a more important factor explaining differences in net income. On farms with negative net farm income, depreciation expenses account for 39 percent of gross income, on average, compared with 13 percent for other operations. Farms with recent major capital expenditures will usually record substantial depreciation expenses, often large enough to generate negative net farm incomes. Correspondingly, older operations with fully depreciated assets rarely report negative net incomes."}, {"section_title": "Tracking How Net Income Flows to Operator Households", "text": "The lower panel of table 16 shows how the fl ow of net income from the farm to the household is derived from the farm business's fi nancial statement. In this case, the calculation starts with gross and net cash income (noncash income-changes in accounts receivable and inventory and the imputed rental value of operator housing-is not included). Depreciation expenses are deducted from net cash income when calculating farm income to the household. 16 Finally, note that farm income to the household also includes income from other farming activities, such as wages from working on other farms or income from another farm business. Most farm operator households do not have these sources of income, but some do. The last row of the table reports farm income to the household. Note that it is considerably different from net cash farm income, primarily because of depreciation expenses. It also differs considerably from net farm income due to the exclusion of noncash income from farm income to the household. "}, {"section_title": "Farm Household Income", "text": "The last line of table 16 provides the farm component of household income for the primary operator's household. Note that it combines income from the farm business, the household's income from rentals of farm land, farm wages paid to household members, and income fl owing to household members from ownership interests in other farm business. But farming is not the only source of household income, which also includes off-farm income whether earned (wages and salaries) or unearned (such as pensions or returns on fi nancial assets). Household income is reported in table 17 for all farm households and the four size classes used earlier. Several striking patterns stand out. Off-farm income is important in all size classes. On average, households earned $43,717 in off-farm income, which was substantial even among very large operations ($44,476, on average). Off-farm income accounts for nearly 80 percent of total household income, on average, for small broiler farms, but still accounts for 34 percent of the total among very large farms. We know, from table 16, that very large operations are substantial farming businesses. Gross farm income-think of it as 2006 contract fees, plus other farm revenues and increases in accounts receivable and inventories-was over $400,000, on average, at very large farms and over $250,000 among large farms. Yet, in each class, off-farm income provided a substantial fraction of total household income. Off-farm employment also frequently provides farm operator households with access to benefi ts, such as health insurance, in addition to wages and salaries. Total household income and household income from farming rise sharply as farm size increases. While the household's income from farming averages $27,643 across all farms, it ranges from $10,012 in the small class to $86,343 among very large operations. Very large operations average nearly eight times as much production as small operations, and their nonbroiler enterprises (crop and livestock cash income in table 16) are four times larger. Average household income for operators of broiler enterprises compares favorably to nationwide averages. Mean household income in the United States was $66,570 in 2006, compared with $72,453 for broiler farm households (table 17). Median income-half of households earn less and half earn more-was $48,201 for all U.S. households in 2006 and $56,248 among operators of broiler farms. "}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "The broiler industry is organized in a unique manner. Almost all broiler production is carried out on contract grow-out operations that are linked to integrators through production contracts. Most grow-out operations are paid through a relative-performance compensation scheme in which contract fees depend, in part, on the grower's production performance relative to other growers. This organization model may be one reason for the industry's commercial success, as evidenced by high growth rates of poultry production, rapid productivity growth, and falling relative prices. Although most contracts include a relative performance design, they are far from uniform. Contracts can include other terms that tie base payments to actions that affect grower costs or that assign some expense or revenue categories to either the grower or the integrator. Contracts also cover a wide range of specifi ed durations from just over a month to 15 years. Variations in contract design likely follow from differences in grower location, size, and housing, but substantial variation in terms and payments make it diffi cult for growers to evaluate contracts. While the survey captures a single year of data, the bottom panel of table 16 provides a signal of changes in the industry. The smallest size class of farms have signifi cantly older houses, on average, and older operators as well. The industry is shifting away from a reliance on smaller operations and toward larger operations whose household income is more closely tied to the broiler enterprise. The size shift is not as pronounced as the changes occurring in hog or dairy production, where very rapid shifts to much larger operations have occurred in recent years (Hoppe et al., 2007). Most broiler production still occurs on relatively small farms, as measured by gross income, and the shifts that have occurred have been more gradual. Because newer operations are larger, they typically have a more substantial investment in housing and associated equipment. In turn, the households that own and run those operations are more reliant on the income from the broiler enterprise, and hence more sensitive to the income risks arising from energy price fl uctuations and contract settlements in the broiler enterprise. New large operations typically receive longer term contracts from integrators, along with the greater assurance that longer contracts may bring, but contract compensation and reimbursement features may also need to be redesigned to handle the differing risk exposures that those larger farms face. During the 1990s, U.S. broiler production grew at rates of about 6 percent per year, but since 2000 growth rates have decreased by half to about 3 percent per year. With slower growth, fewer new houses have been constructed and relatively few new operations have entered into production. The industry's rapid productivity growth has been driven, in large part, by improved poultry genetics, but also by steady improvements in structures, equipment, and production practices. These improvements, taken together, have led to greater feed effi ciency, lower mortality, and more intensive use of capital and labor services-essentially, raising the output of broiler meat that can be achieved for given inputs of feed, fuel, capital, and labor inputs. Slowing investment in new housing could reduce the industry's productivity growth and, in turn, limit any price advantages over other meats."}]
