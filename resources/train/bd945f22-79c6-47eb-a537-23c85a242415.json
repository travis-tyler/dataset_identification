Secondary aims tested for differential response to the curriculum among SS-ELs as a function of (a) mathematics skills at the beginning of kindergarten, (b) the number of SS-ELs in classrooms, and (c) the frequency of mathematical discourse during core mathematics instruction. Data analyzed in the study were generated from a recent large-scale efficacy trial. Participants were 556 SS-ELs from 66 kindergarten classrooms. Results suggest SS-ELs in treatment classrooms made greater gains than SS-ELs in comparison classrooms on mathematics measures across the school year. Evidence of differential response to the curriculum among SS-ELs was not found. The importance of core mathematics instruction and implications for school psychologists are discussed.\nWhile the societal importance of teaching for early mathematical proficiency has gained national attention (National Mathematics Advisory Panel [NMAP], 2008) , mounting evidence suggests that students from a variety of subgroups struggle to meet grade-level expectations in mathematics. Among these atrisk subgroups are English learners (ELs) or children of linguistic minority groups who lack full proficiency in English and receive language assistance. ELs represent a major presence in U.S. schools, and for the past 20 years, they have been the fastest growing subgroup (Klingner & Eppolito, 2014) . Recent estimates suggest that ELs comprise 10% of the U.S. student population and that 70% of this subgroup is Spanish speaking (Fry & Passel, 2009 ). Considering the rising presence of ELs in U.S. public schools and the alarming number being disproportionately identified for special education (Sullivan, 2011) , schools and teachers face the daunting challenge of meeting the instructional needs of ELs. Recent research shows, however, that schools are struggling to support ELs in developing mathematical proficiency.\nMathematics achievement data from the 2013 National Assessment for Educational Progress (NAEP) indicate that 86% and 95% of fourth-grade and eighth-grade ELs, respectively, scored below proficient (National Center for Education Statistics [NCES], 2013) . There are also strong indications that ELs do not achieve commensurate with their Englishproficient peers. According to recent research, the math achievement gap between ELs and English-proficient students appears early and remains relatively stable over the years (Reardon & Galindo, 2009 ). Since 1996, NAEP results have shown that an educationally meaningful achievement gap exists between ELs in fourth grade and their English-proficient peers and that this gap is nearly twice as large in eighth grade (NCES, 2013) .\nThe convincing evidence that suggests ELs experience early and persistent math difficulties comes at a time when the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSS-M; Common Core State Standards Initiative [CCSSI] , 2010) have significantly raised the mathematical proficiency bar for U.S. students. The CCSS-M, relative to previous state standards, places greater demand on the development and use of academic language in math (Dingman, Teuscher, Newton, & Kasmer, 2013) . Students must now use precise mathematical language and vocabulary, verbalize and justify solution methods, and critique the reasoning of others (Standards for Mathematical Practice; CCSSI, 2010) . While all students face the linguistic challenges associated with learning to use the language of math in the context of the CCSS-M, these demands are compounded for ELs. They, unlike their peers who are native English speakers, face the unfortunate \"double demands\" ) of having to simultane-ously acquire proficiency in two languages: English and mathematics (Cirillo, Richardson Bruna, & Herbel-Eisenmann, 2010; Moschkovich, 1999) .\nGiven the likelihood that many ELs will struggle to acquire math proficiency, a major focus of educational research and practice should be on improving the quality of core math instruction delivered in general education settings. For many students, core math instruction serves as the primary source of math instruction. This is particularly true in the early elementary grades, when logistic constraints (e.g., half-day programs in kindergarten) and a primary focus on reading instruction may limit the availability of time and resources to support math achievement beyond core instruction. Core math instruction, therefore, must be effectively designed and delivered to meet the instructional needs of all students, including ELs and other students at risk for math difficulties. Evidence from recent randomized controlled trials has begun to document the utility of effective core math instruction in promoting student math achievement, preventing math difficulties, and reducing student need for highly intensive math interventions (Agodini & Harris, 2010; Chard et al., 2008; Clarke et al., 2011; Fuchs, Fuchs, & Prentice, 2004) ."}, {"section_title": "PLAUSIBLE SOURCES OF MATH DIFFICULTIES FOR ELS", "text": "While many factors (e.g., sociocultural, linguistic, cognitive) may contribute to the difficulties that ELs experience in acquiring math proficiency, it is important to consider how instructional factors influence and, in some cases, initiate difficulties in math. A lack of language-intensive instruction is one instructional factor that may explain why so many ELs are struggling with math and other academic areas (Cirillo et al., 2010; Lee, Quinn, & Vald\u00e9s, 2013; Moschkovich, 1999) . Research in the areas of reading Gersten et al., 2007) , social studies (Vaughn et al., 2009) , and science (August et al., 2014; Lee et al., 2013) has found that the academic achievement of ELs is dependent on meaningful opportunities to engage in the use of disciplinary language. In this study, we hypothesized that this principle would also hold true for ELs in the area of math. We base this hypothesis on findings from a growing line of classroom observation research that has shown that increased student math achievement is associated with student math verbalizations (Clements, Agodini, & Harris, 2013; Doabler et al., 2015) . It can be argued then that classrooms, particularly those with higher percentages of ELs, should provide structured opportunities for students to verbalize their mathematical understanding and thought processes.\nAn underdeveloped empirical research base in the area of effective math instruction for ELs can also be implicated as a contributing factor to the difficulties ELs face with math. While significant efforts have been made in the practice of preventing reading difficulties for ELs Gersten et al., 2007) , few rigorously conducted studies have investigated the impact of interventions on the math achievement of ELs. For example, Janzen (2008) conducted a synthesis of the literature from 1990 to 2007 on teaching ELs in the content areas of English, math, science, and history. Janzen classified the findings within each content area into linguistic, cognitive, sociocultural, and pedagogical subcategories. None of the 12 articles codified under the pedagogical category in math used a research methodology, such as a randomized controlled trial, quasi-experimental design, or single-case design, rigorous enough to identify and establish the causal agents linked to improved math achievement for ELs (Flay et al., 2005) .\nSince Janzen's (2008) review, there has been a continued lack of rigorous experimental research on math instruction for ELs. In fact, Richards-Tutor, Baker, Gersten, Baker, and Smith (2016) conducted a review of the literature base from 2000 to 2012 and found no experimental studies on math interventions with ELs. Our own review of the research from 2013 to the time of this study revealed just three math intervention studies involv-ing ELs (i.e., Orosco, 2014; Orosco, Swanson, O'Connor, & Lussier, 2011; Shumate, Campbell-Whatley, & Lo, 2012) . This paucity of research sheds light on the urgency to build the knowledge base on effective math instruction for ELs. This study sought to address this need by conducting a secondary analysis on the impact of a core (Tier 1) kindergarten curriculum on the math outcomes of Spanishspeaking English learners (SS-ELs)."}, {"section_title": "EXPLICIT MATH INSTRUCTION AND ITS ROLE IN MATH PROFICIENCY FOR ELS", "text": "One instructional approach that has strong potential for supporting ELs in developing mathematical proficiency is explicit math instruction. Over the past decade, research has begun to establish a solid evidentiary basis for using explicit math instruction to teach at-risk learners (Baker, Gersten, & Lee, 2002; Bryant et al., 2011; Clarke et al., 2011; Gersten et al., 2009; NMAP, 2008; Orosco, 2014; Orosco et al., 2011) . For example, in a meta-analysis of 41 studies targeting students with math difficulties, Gersten et al. (2009) found that explicit instruction had the largest impact, g \u03ed 1.22, 95% CI [0.78, 1.67], among seven dimensions of math instruction.\nIn this study, we hypothesized that a core math curriculum characterized by a systematic and explicit instructional architecture would have positive effects on the math outcomes of SS-ELs. We based this hypothesis on several factors. First, a systematic core curriculum judiciously prioritizes instruction around critical content, connects new content with students' background knowledge, selects and sequences instructional examples, and scaffolds instruction. These design features are employed to ensure high rates of student success with new and complex math concepts. Second, explicit math instruction expects teachers to overtly model and demonstrate what they want students to learn. Research from the learning sciences suggests that explicit demonstrations are a more efficient and effective way of presenting critical academic content to students compared with less explicit teaching methods, such as discovery and problem-based learning, as well as inquiry-based teaching (Mayer, 2004) . A third reason explicit math instruction may benefit ELs is that it offers timely and specific academic feedback as students engage in guided and independent learning activities. A growing body of evidence indicates that providing specific, informational feedback about a student response or action improves learning and helps students understand how they performed during the process of learning (Halpern et al., 2007; Hattie & Timperley, 2007) .\nFourth, explicit math instruction also systematically incorporates visual models to promote a deep understanding of key concepts and skills (Doabler et al., 2012) . At-risk learners often experience difficulties understanding the relationship between math models and abstract symbols and therefore require support in making this crucial connection (Gersten et al., 2009) . A fifth reason explicit math instruction may benefit ELs is that this instructional approach facilitates productive discourse around critical math content and incorporates systematic opportunities to support key vocabulary development. In this study, productive math discourse is operationally defined as verbalizations between students and teachers, as well as among students, around critical math concepts. Empirical studies point to the fact that for young students to learn math, they must be given deliberate opportunities to verbalize their mathematical thinking (Doabler et al., 2015; Gersten et al., 2009) . Such verbalizations can help ELs build critical language skills in both English and mathematics ."}, {"section_title": "EMPIRICAL SUPPORT FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AN EXPLICIT CORE MATHEMATICS CURRICULUM", "text": "While explicit math instruction is most well known for its role in small-group interventions, we have found encouraging results when using this instructional approach in core educational settings (i.e., general education classrooms). A primary focus of this line of efficacy research has been the Early Learning in Mathematics (ELM) curriculum. ELM is a yearlong, 120-lesson core curriculum that targets kindergarten math topics identified in the CCSS-M (CCSSI, 2010). Our research team developed the ELM curriculum based on an explicit and systematic architecture to early math instruction. Under this framework, ELM incorporates validated, explicit instructional design and delivery principles (Chard et al., 2008; Clarke et al., 2011) and thus targets the instructional needs of all students, including typically achieving students, students with math difficulties, and ELs with various first languages.\nRecent efficacy research has documented preliminary empirical support for ELM's capacity to (a) increase the math achievement of struggling learners (Chard et al., 2008; Clarke et al., 2011) and (b) support teachers in facilitating structured classroom discourse around critical math concepts and skills (Doabler et al., 2014) . In a recent randomized controlled trial, we tested the efficacy of ELM, randomly assigning 66 kindergarten classrooms to treatment and control conditions (business as usual) (Clarke et al., 2011) . The student sample included approximately 1,300 kindergarten students, including at-risk and typically achieving children. Analyses revealed statistically significant effects for students in ELM classrooms over students in control classrooms on the Test of Early Mathematics Ability-Third Edition (TEMA-3; t \u03ed 2.41, p \u03ed .02, Hedges's g \u03ed 0.15) and Early Numeracy Curriculum-Based Measurement (EN-CBM; t \u03ed 1.99, p \u03ed .05, g \u03ed 0.13). We also found that at-risk students (i.e., students who scored below the 40th percentile on the TEMA-3 at pretest) significantly outperformed their at-risk control peers on both the TEMA-3 (t \u03ed 3.29, p \u03fd .01, g \u03ed 0.24) and EN-CBM total score (t \u03ed 2.54, p \u03ed .01, g \u03ed 0.22).\nMore recently, Doabler et al. (2014) investigated the efficacy of the ELM curriculum in 129 kindergarten classrooms from 46 schools in Oregon and Texas. The study differed from previous investigations of ELM (Chard et al., 2008; Clarke et al., 2011) in that it had a specific focus on teacher outcomes rather than student math achievement. Doabler et al. examined whether ELM increased teachers' facilitation of high-quality instructional interactions. Findings suggested that ELM stimulated more opportunities for teachers and students to engage in high-quality mathematical discussions compared with classrooms in the control condition. Specifically, higher rates of math verbalizations by groups of students (t \u03ed 5.09, p \u03fd .001, g \u03ed 0.91) and individuals (t \u03ed 3.30, p \u03ed .001, g \u03ed 0.57) were found in ELM classrooms."}, {"section_title": "PURPOSE OF THE CURRENT STUDY AND RESEARCH QUESTIONS", "text": "A clear and compelling need exists to build a scientific knowledge base of effective instructional practices aimed at increasing the math achievement of ELs. To this end, the purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of the ELM core math curriculum on the math achievement of SS-ELs. To our knowledge, no similar research on core mathematics instruction for ELs in general, and SS-ELs in particular, has been conducted.\nIn addition to studying the efficacy of ELM, we tested a set of a priori student-and classroom-level predictors of differential response to the ELM curriculum (Burns, 2011) . Because level of mathematical knowledge at kindergarten entry is a proxy of risk status and has been found to be one of the strongest predictors of later math achievement (Duncan et al., 2007; Morgan, Farkas, & Wu, 2009) , we examined whether the effects of ELM differed by SS-ELs' initial skill performance in math. In addition, we investigated whether the extent to which SS-ELs are distributed across classrooms influenced the efficacy of ELM. Recent studies have suggested that classrooms with higher percentages of disadvantaged students, including SS-ELs, produce lower student math achievement (Isenberg et al., 2013) . We also tested whether the use of mathematical language in classrooms was a predictor of differential response to ELM. As math standards increasingly emphasize the need for students to understand math concepts and demonstrate their mathematical understanding through verbal explanations of what math problems are asking and how they can be solved, this study offered an important opportunity to test the impact of an innovative approach in math with SS-ELs. It may be, for example, that by facilitation of multiple opportunities for students to verbally express their mathematical thinking and problem solving, SS-ELs will have more opportunities to understand math concepts and procedures and improve their math skills. We believe this study is the first to investigate such a hypothesis, particularly in the context of testing the impact of a core math curriculum with a strong emphasis on math discourse.\nIn summary, this study was guided by the following four research questions:\n1. What is the effect of the ELM curriculum on the math achievement among SS-ELs? 2. Do math skills at the beginning of kindergarten, as measured by the TEMA-3, predict differential response to the ELM curriculum among SS-ELs? 3. Does the number of SS-ELs in classrooms predict differential response to the ELM curriculum among SS-ELs? 4. Does the frequency of math discourse in classrooms predict differential response to the ELM curriculum among SS-ELs?"}, {"section_title": "METHOD", "text": "This study conducted a secondary analysis of data collected during a large-scale efficacy trial funded by the Institute of Education Sciences and designed to investigate the efficacy of the ELM core kindergarten curriculum (Clarke et al., 2011) .

With blocking on schools, 129 kindergarten classrooms were randomly assigned to either treatment (ELM, n \u03ed 68) or comparison (district-approved kindergarten math instruction, n \u03ed 61) conditions. Thus, the ELM efficacy trial treated classrooms as the primary unit of analysis. In all, the original sample included 2,598 kindergarten students attending 129 classrooms in 46 schools. The ELM efficacy trial collected data from participating students to (a) document demographic characteristics and (b) measure gains in student math achievement from the beginning to the end of kindergarten. Classroom observations were also conducted in both conditions at fall, winter, and spring time points to measure the amount of math classroom discourse used during core math instruction.\nPrior to analyzing the data, we established two inclusion criteria for what would constitute an eligible ELM efficacy trial classroom. A classroom was considered eligible if it (a) enrolled students considered as ELs whose first language was Spanish and (b) provided complete student demographic data related to students' English language status. From the original sample of 129 kindergarten classrooms, 63 classrooms were dropped because they did not include SS-ELs or because they provided incomplete EL status information.

The program consists of four quarterly teacher manuals, each containing 30 daily lessons.

Each manual offers scripted guidelines to support teachers in demonstrating key math content, delivering timely academic feedback, and facilitating deliberate practice opportunities for students, including structured verbal interactions between teachers and students, as well as among students, around key math content. Such practice opportunities are systematically designed to help students build mathematical proficiency and develop mathematical language and vocabulary. To promote conceptual understanding, lessons incorporate opportunities for students to work with visual representations of math ideas, such as 3-day shapes, counting blocks, and number lines. Math domains targeted in ELM include (a) counting and cardinality, (b) operations and algebraic thinking, (c) number and operations in base 10, (d) measurement and data, (e) geometry, and (f) precise math vocabulary. Daily lessons last approximately 45 minutes and include four to five math activities including (a) whole-class and small-group activities focused on new mathematical content, (b) judicious review activities of previously learned material, and (c) worksheet activities that provide students extended practice with previously taught concepts and skills. Problemsolving activities are introduced every five lessons to help students practice newly acquired problem-solving skills and engage in real-world mathematical problems, such as collecting categorical data and representing the data on a graph.

"}, {"section_title": "Core Math Instruction and English Learners", "text": "\nand, in turn, allow them to achieve early success with new math content. The finding of no differential response based on the initial skill levels of SS-ELs is also somewhat surprising given that a previous study of ELM (Clarke et al., 2011) revealed that the curriculum was more effective for students considered at risk for math difficulties at the start of the kindergarten year (i.e., TEMA-3 pretest scores at or below the 40th percentile on the TEMA-3) than for students considered on track for developing mathematical proficiency (i.e., TEMA-3 pretest scores above the 40th percentile on the TEMA-3). While only 11% of SS-ELs in the current sample tested above the 40th percentile on the TEMA-3 at pretest, we believe a strong case can be made from this study that typically achieving SS-ELs, like their SS-EL peers who are at risk for math difficulties at the start of kindergarten, may require explicit and systematic core math instruction given their limited proficiency in the English language. Converging evidence from investigations of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten cohort indicate that early math skills acquired in kindergarten are critical for acquiring proficiency in later math and building knowledge in other content areas, including reading and science (Classens & Engel, 2013 , Duncan et al., 2007 , Morgan et al., 2009 ). Therefore, it seems reasonable that all ELs may need an explicit and systematic core math curriculum to make a successful start in kindergarten math and begin to tackle the double demands of simultaneously learning the languages of English and math."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "This study examined the impact of a 120-lesson core kindergarten math curriculum on the math achievement of SS-ELs. For SS-ELs in ELM classrooms, there was a significant effect on one of the two outcome measures, the TEMA-3. The impact on the second outcome measure, EN-CBM, was positive but nonsignificant. Overall, results would be classified as a \"statistically significant positive effect\" (WWC, 2014). Analyses examining differential response found no difference in response to ELM for SS-ELs by initial skill status, the number of SS-ELs in the classroom, and a set of student-teacher interaction behaviors theorized to facilitate mathematical discourse used in core math instruction.\nWe believe the finding that initial skill status, as measured by the TEMA-3 at the beginning of kindergarten, did not influence the impact of ELM for SS-ELs is encouraging because it suggests that ELM essentially had the same positive impact for all SS-ELs regardless of the amount of informal math knowledge they had prior to school entry. In other words, ELM seemed to work equally well across a range of skill levels. It may be that the instructional design features of the ELM curriculum are configured in a manner that can help support the majority of SS-EL kindergarten students in developing early math proficiency. For example, SS-ELs may gain a deep understanding of how numbers work through ELM's sequence of instruction, which strategically intersperses concrete instructional examples with abstract representations of numbers. SS-ELs, and ELs in general, may also benefit from the way in which ELM uses simpler instructional examples rather than complex ones to introduce and teach new math concepts and vocabulary. It is plausible that these introductory instructional examples and problem contexts help engage the existing understandings and experiences of SS-ELs "}, {"section_title": "Limitations of the Study", "text": "A number of critical limitations should be considered when examining the findings from the study. First, the designation of a student as an EL was based on district methodology that varied widely across the participating districts. In part, this reflects the reality of actual practice (Sullivan, 2011) . Thus caution should be exercised in extrapolating results of the current study to students and districts that may employ different classification methods. A second limitation was the study's lack of a measure of English proficiency. This absence prevented us from examining whether students' proficiency with English moderated the treatment effects. As with any study conducted within a unique geographic and demographic sample, a focus should be on replicating results across an array of diverse sites and participants (Cook, 2014) .\nAnother limitation is that only two observations in the Texas classrooms were conducted using the COSTI-M. The decision to limit the number of COSTI-M observations was based primarily on the availability of trained observers. Nonetheless, two observations in Texas may explain the lack of significance for differential response to ELM as a function of the rate of productive math discourse in Tier 1 settings. The tactic used to measure math discourse opportunities for SSELs is another limitation. In the ELM efficacy trial, productive math discourse was coded at the classroom level. Consequently, opportunities for SS-ELs to verbally convey their mathematical thinking may have been confounded by the verbalizations of non-ELs.\nThere is also some concern about how directly we were able to evaluate math performance on the content taught as part of the ELM curriculum. Given that ELM addresses multiple math domains (i.e., counting and cardinality, operations and algebraic thinking, number and operations in base 10, measurement and data, geometry, and precise math vocabulary), our use of the TEMA-3 and EN-CBM as outcome measures may not have aligned fully with the content coverage of ELM. The TEMA-3 focuses primarily on whole-number understanding, and the EN-CBM measures focus on discrete aspects of number sense (e.g., magnitude comparison). These foundational skills are covered early in the scope and sequence of ELM's first quarterly teacher manual. Future research should use a more proximal assessment that directly links to the concepts taught across the math domains of ELM.\nAnother important issue to consider is the use of English-based math assessments. While the primary first language of this study's sample was Spanish, all math assessments were administered in English. Consequently, potential language barriers may have affected SS-ELs' pretest and posttest performances. Future research involving SS-ELs should administer standardized math assessments in both English and Spanish. This would allow for comparisons between students' math skills in English and Spanish.\nLast, it should be noted that while we theorize that the instructional architecture of ELM was the primary agent affecting outcomes, treatment teachers were provided professional development on the ELM curriculum and on effective teaching strategies and behaviors. While the professional development was primarily centered on ELM components and implementation, a stronger research design would have controlled for the impact of professional development by providing comparison teachers with general experiences on teaching strategies and behaviors. Doing so would have eliminated professional development as an alternate possible cause and confounder when interpreting the study results."}, {"section_title": "Implications for Future Research and School Psychologists", "text": "Future research should explore the potential of differential impact based on levels of English proficiency among ELs with a variety of first languages, including Spanish. In this study, we were unable to obtain English proficiency scores for participating students. Therefore, it is difficult to conclude whether SS-ELs with lower English proficiency would have responded differently to the ELM curriculum. Regardless, collecting English language proficiency data is of high importance, particularly as the field moves to implementing Multi-Tiered Systems of Support (MTSS) in mathematics (Clarke et al., 2011; Fuchs, Fuchs, & Compton, 2012) . English language proficiency data can help ensure the range of learner needs is appropriately considered when providing instructional support within an MTSS.\nSchool psychologists are uniquely positioned to help schools and districts think systematically about building effective MTSS in mathematics. For example, school psychologists can assist schools and teachers in evaluating the effectiveness or quality of Tier 1 math instruction. Core math instruction is intended to serve as a valuable first line of defense in preventing math difficulties and accelerating the math achievement of at-risk learners. Therefore, school psychologists can provide strong insight into which ELs are likely to respond to Tier 1 core math instruction. Establishing the impact of a core math curriculum for ELs will also help determine if failure of an EL student to make sufficient growth is the result of lower levels of English language skills or because of difficulties specific to math. That is, if the core curriculum is effective for ELs in general, an EL's nonresponse could more readily be attributed to a true deficit in math. In an MTSS, these ELs would be considered in need of a Tier 2 intervention. Because research on math instruction for ELs is severely limited (Richards-Tutor et al., 2016) , future studies should not only focus on the effectiveness of core curricula but also be linked to ongoing efforts to develop and evaluate effective Tier 2 and 3 interventions (Gersten et al., 2009) . As a result, this will better allow schools the opportunity to provide a full continuum of intensive support for ELs struggling with math.\nIn addition, school psychologists will be able to assist teachers in examining core math programs for the presence of validated instructional design and delivery principles, such as overt teacher demonstrations and deliberate verbalizations of math concepts. Core math programs are integral components of an MTSS. We hypothesized that ELM's architecture of instruction would be a key ingredient in affecting student outcomes because of its incorporation of explicit instructional design and delivery principles. To some extent, this general hypothesis was supported as ELM had a positive impact on the math achievement of SS-ELs. However, additional analyses revealed the effect of the ELM curriculum did not vary as a function of rates of math discourse during core math instruction (e.g., rate of group responses). In other words, the im-pact of ELM was essentially the same between classrooms with high and low rates of math discourse opportunities. While the results suggest that the rate of discourse opportunities did not surface as a predictor of treatment response for SS-ELs, the nature of the ELM curriculum may have obscured the importance of math verbalizations. That is, because ELM is a scripted curriculum and thus ensures multiple opportunities to engage in math discourse, each ELM classroom may have provided, at a minimum, the math verbalizations needed for SS-ELs to benefit and, once the minimum threshold was met, there was a limited impact above and beyond that threshold.\nResearch suggests that language-intensive math instruction is critical to students' development of math knowledge (Doabler et al., 2015; Gersten et al., 2009 ). However, less is known about when math discourse opportunities should take place during the learning process and to what extent they should be cognitively demanding for students, including those with limited proficiency in English. Future investigation of these areas is warranted along with considering the quality of the math verbalization opportunities ELs receive during core math instruction. This triad approach of documenting the quantity, quality, and cognitive demand of math verbalizations would likely provide a more comprehensive picture of whether all students, including ELs, are receiving effective, evidence-based math instruction and meaningful access to grade-level math content."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "Despite the preponderance of evidence that a successful start in math is critical for all students (Classens & Engel, 2013; Morgan et al., 2009) , as well as the fact that a concerning number of ELs are struggling to acquire proficiency in math (NCES, 2013) , there is an alarming shortage of empirical literature on effective math instruction for ELs (Janzen, 2008; Richards-Tutor et al., 2016) . The current study addresses the urgent need for research in this critical area. While findings from this study are limited, they do indicate promise and should serve as a watershed for future research.
