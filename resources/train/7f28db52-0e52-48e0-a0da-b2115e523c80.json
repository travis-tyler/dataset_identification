In contrast, parietal metabolism and hippocampal volume did not differ between APOE2 and APOE3 genotypes, and both groups showed comparable negative effects of age on these markers. The amyloid specificity of APOE2-related brain changes was corroborated in 2 complementary analyses: spatially unbiased voxel-wise analyses showing widespread reductions in amyloid deposition but no differences in gray matter volume or metabolism and an analysis of CSF-based biomarkers showing a significant effect on amyloid but not on tau pathology.\nRegarding the range of Alzheimer disease biomarkers considered in the present study, the APOE2 allele appears to have a relatively selective effect on reduced accumulation of amyloid pathology in the aged brain.

Moreover, each of these studies was limited to the assessment of a single imaging modality; thus, the specificity of the detected APOE2 effect for the examined aspect of brain integrity remains unknown.\nHere, we used a large, multimodal neuroimaging dataset to comprehensively study the potential protective effects of the APOE2 allele on cortical amyloid deposition (using AV45-PET), brain structure (structural MRI), and metabolic function (fluorodeoxyglucose [FDG]-PET) within the same sample of older individuals without dementia.\nMETHODS Participants. All data used in the present study were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), a multicenter longitudinal study collecting clinical, neuroimaging, and other biological markers of AD progression in cognitively normal (CN) older individuals and patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early AD dementia (adni-info. org). The present study sample consisted of 572 older individuals without dementia from the ADNI-GO and ADNI-2 cohorts including 176 CN participants and 396 participants with MCI. Detailed diagnostic criteria have been reported previously 17 and are published on the ADNI website (adni.loni.usc.edu/methods/). Both ADNI-specific categories of early MCI and late MCI, which differ only in the applied cutoff for objective memory impairment, were included in the MCI sample. Eligibility criteria for the present study included availability of APOE genotyping and availability of AV45-PET, FDG-PET, and high-resolution structural MRI acquisitions from the same study time point.\nAPOE genotype was determined by genotyping the 2 single nucleotide polymorphisms that define the APOE e2, e3, and e4 alleles (rs429358, rs7412) with DNA extracted by Cogenics from a 3-mL aliquot of EDTA blood (adni.loni.usc.edu/data-samples/ genetic-data/).\nThe total sample of older individuals without dementia was stratified according to the following APOE genotypes: e2/e3 (APOE2; n 5 50, 8.9%), e3/e3 (APOE3; n 5 282, 50%), and combined e3/e4 or e4/e4 (APOE4, n 5 232, 41.1%). The very rare e2/e2 genotype was not present in our study sample. To avoid confounding effects of the APOE4 allele, individuals with an e2/e4 genotype (8 MCI, 0 CN) were excluded from analyses. In this study, we focused on differences between APOE2 and APOE3 groups, given that APOE4 effects have been well documented in several previous studies, including 2 recent multimodal imaging studies on overlapping samples from the ADNI cohort. 18, 19 Memory function of the different APOE groups was characterized with a neuropsychometric composite score that has been described in detail previously. 20 In addition to the baseline data, 2-year longitudinal follow-up (24.5 6 2.1 months) of composite memory score was available for 84% of the study sample.\nStandard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient consents. Data collection and sharing in ADNI were approved by the Institutional Review Board of each participating institution, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants.\nImaging data. Acquisition and standardized preprocessing steps of the multicentric MRI and PET imaging data in ADNI have been reported previously 17 and are described in detail on the ADNI website (adni.loni.usc.edu/methods/). Briefly, structural MRI data were acquired on 3T scanning platforms using T1-weighted sagittal 3-dimensional magnetization-prepared rapid-acquisition gradient echo sequences. AV45-PET scans were acquired during a 50-to 70-minute interval following a 370-MBq bolus injection of AV45. FDG-PET scans were acquired during a 30-to 60-minute interval following a 185-MBq bolus injection of [ 18 F]-FDG. All ADNI imaging data undergo standardized preprocessing steps aimed at increasing data uniformity across the multicenter scanner platforms.\nImaging data were processed with SPM8 (Wellcome Trust Center for Neuroimaging) and the associated VBM8 toolbox (dbm.neuro.uni-jena.de/vbm/) implemented in MATLAB R2013a (MathWorks, Natick, MA) as described in detail previously. 17 Image processing involved tissue-type segmentation of the structural MRI scans, followed by a high-dimensional registration to an aging/AD-specific reference template 21 and spatial normalization of the gray matter (GM) tissue maps (with modulation of voxel values). AV45-and FDG-PET scans were rigidly coregistered to the corresponding structural MRI scan, corrected for partial volume effects, 22 and spatially normalized with the registration parameters from the corresponding MRI scans.\nThe distinct imaging signals were sampled from regions of interest (ROIs) that are sensitive for AD-related alterations in the respective imaging modalities (figure 1), i.e., the precuneus for AV45-PET, 23 a composite parietal cortical ROI for FDG-PET, 24 and the hippocampus for GM volume. AV45-and FDG-PET uptake means were converted to standard uptake value ratios by proportional scaling to signal within the whole cerebellum and pons, respectively, and hippocampal GM volumes were scaled by the total intracranial volume.

Demographic and baseline clinical charac-", "text": "teristics were compared between genotypic groups by use of 2-sample t tests for parametric variables and the Fisher exact test for binary variables. Statistical significance of differences in imaging markers and 2-year change in memory function between the APOE2 and APOE3 groups were assessed with analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models controlled for age, sex, education, and clinical diagnosis.\nEffects of age on each imaging marker were assessed separately for each genotypic group with multiple linear regression controlled for sex, education, and clinical diagnosis. Additional models included a genotype 3 age interaction term to assess the statistical significance of differences in regression slopes between genotypic groups. Complementary analyses using dichotomous amyloid status instead of continuous standard uptake value ratio as the outcome variable are reported in appendix e-2. Analyses were carried out with the software package IBM SPSS Statistics version 21 (IBM, Armonk, NY).\nComplementary analyses. In 2 sets of secondary analyses, we aimed to corroborate our primary ROI-based findings of significant main effects of APOE2 genotype.\nFirst, differences between APOE2 and APOE3 groups were assessed with voxel-wise tests that are independent of the a priori selection of modality-specific ROIs. Voxel-wise analyses used analog ANCOVA models controlled for age, sex, education, and clinical diagnosis. Preprocessed imaging data were smoothed with a gaussian smoothing kernel of 8 mm, and analyses were restricted to a GM mask of the reference template. AV45-and FDG-PET maps were proportionately scaled to whole cerebellum and pons uptake values, respectively, and analyses of GM maps included total intracranial volume as an additional nuisance regressor. Results were assessed at a voxel-wise statistical threshold of p , 0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate.\nSecond, genotypic group differences were also assessed with CSF biomarkers. Complete CSF measures of b-amyloid (Ab) 42 , phosphorylated (p-tau), and total tau (t-tau) from the same study time point were available for z85% of the included study sample. Methods for CSF biomarker quantification in the ADNI cohort are based on the xMAP Luminex platform and Innogenetics/Fujirebio AlzBio3 immunoassay kits and are described in detail elsewhere 25 (adni.loni.usc.edu/methods/). Genotypic group differences in CSF Ab 42 , p-tau, and t-tau were assessed with ANCOVA models analogous to those for the imaging markers.\nRESULTS Demographic and clinical characteristics of the study sample are summarized in table 1. APOE2 carriers did not differ significantly from the APOE3 genotype in any of the assessed demographic or baseline clinical variables. Both groups showed stable memory performance over the 2-year followup period, and changes in memory score did not differ between the 2 groups (p 5 0.68).\nAPOE2 effects on multimodal imaging markers. Mean values of precuneal amyloid load, parietal glucose metabolism, and hippocampal volume for each of the genotypic groups are summarized in table 2. Precuneal amyloid load was significantly lower in APOE2 carriers compared to the APOE3 group (p 5 0.009). In contrast, parietal metabolism (p 5 0.41) and hippocampal volume (p 5 0.92) did not differ significantly between the 2 groups. Figure 2 shows the different imaging markers plotted against age with fitted linear regression lines for each genotypic group. Precuneal amyloid load was independently associated with age in the APOE3 (b 5 0.35, p , 0.001) but not in the APOE2 (b 5 0.10, p 5 0.49) group, although the difference in slope estimates was only trend-level significant (p 5 0.06). In contrast, parietal hypometabolism and hippocampal volume showed similar negative associations with age in both genotypic groups, and differences in regression slopes were not significant (p . 0.45).\nAll of these findings remained unchanged when the study sample was limited to white individuals.\nVoxel-wise findings. Voxel-wise analyses across the whole brain confirmed a reduced amyloid load in APOE2 carriers compared to the APOE3 group that mapped to large parts of the posterior parietal, temporal, and frontal neocortex ( figure 3 ). In contrast, no evidence of higher metabolism or GM volume in APOE2 carriers compared to the APOE3 group was found throughout the brain. APOE2 effects on CSF markers. In analogy to the amyloid specificity of the imaging marker findings, APOE2 carriers had significantly higher CSF Ab 42 levels compared to the APOE3 group (p 5 0.02), whereas levels of p-tau (p 5 0.15) and t-tau (p 5 0.23) were not significantly different (table 2) . DISCUSSION We used multimodal imaging data from a large cohort of older individuals without dementia to investigate differences in neuroimaging markers of molecular (amyloid), structural (GM volume), and functional (glucose metabolism) brain health between APOE2 carriers and those homozygous for the APOE3 allele. We found that older individuals without dementia who carry an APOE2 allele had less precuneal amyloid pathology and did not show the typical age-related increase in amyloid load (although the age 3 genotype interaction was only trend-level significant). On the other hand, imaging markers of brain structure and function in AD-susceptible regions, including hippocampus volume and parietal metabolism, did not differ significantly between the APOE2 and APOE3 genotypes, and both groups showed comparable negative effects of age on these markers. The specificity of APOE2-related brain changes for amyloid pathology was reinforced by complementary voxel-wise analyses that are independent of the a priori selection of AD-typical ROIs, as well as by an analysis of CSF biomarkers that showed a significant APOE2 effect on reduced amyloid pathology but not on markers of tau pathology. Our study demonstrated a protective role of the APOE2 allele on cortical amyloid deposits in older individuals without dementia. In contrast to the APOE4 AD risk allele, neuroimaging studies assessing brain changes associated with the protective APOE2 allele are still rare. Only one previous study used amyloid PET imaging (Pittsburgh compound B [PiB]-PET) to investigate APOE2 effects on quantitative indexes of cerebral amyloid load in 241 CN older persons, including 29 APOE2 carriers. 12 However, when controlling for the effect of APOE4, i.e., specifically assessing differences between APOE2 carriers and APOE3 homozygotes, the effect of APOE2 carrier status on global cortical PiB-PET uptake values or their relation with age was not statistically significant. More robust in vivo evidence for an amyloid-protective effect of the APOE2 allele comes from a recent meta-analytic study of dichotomous amyloid status derived from pooled amyloid-PET or CSF Ab 42 data across several cohorts totaling 2,130 genotyped older persons with normal cognition and 2,832 with MCI. 8 In both diagnostic groups, differential age-related increases in the prevalence of amyloid positivity were found between all APOE genotypes, being lowest in APOE2 carriers, intermediate in APOE3 homozygotes, and highest in APOE4 carriers. This also translated into significant group differences in the prevalence of amyloid positivity between APOE2 carriers and APOE3 homozygotes at the median age of 70 years. This study also indicated that increases in amyloid pathology associated with the APOE4 allele were much more pronounced than decreases in amyloid pathology associated with the APOE2 allele, possibly explaining the unexpected negative findings in the earlier PiB-PET study. 12 Interestingly, this differential effect on amyloid load also parallels differences in effect size for the alleledependent risk of cognitive decline 3, 4 and AD dementia 2 and could be related to differences in the regulation of amyloid clearance between the respective APOE isoforms. 26 The examination of amyloid-PET data alone cannot answer the question of whether neurobiological effects of the protective APOE2 allele are specific for reduced amyloid pathology or similarly extend to positive effects on brain structure or function that may increase the resilience of the brain against AD pathology. Our findings demonstrate a relatively specific effect of APOE2 on cortical amyloid deposition in the absence of any notable effect on glucose metabolism or GM volume. To the best of our knowledge, APOE2 effects on neuronal metabolism as measured by FDG-PET have not been studied before, and only a small number of MRI studies have specifically examined APOE2 effects on brain structure or function in older age. However, the findings from these studies are inconclusive, with some studies showing (marginally significant) larger volumes of the hippocampus 15 or other temporal lobe structures 27 in APOE2 carriers and others finding no volume differences 14 or finding only differences in longitudinal atrophy rates, not in baseline volumes. 11 A recent functional MRI study indicated a protective effect of the APOE2 allele on age-related decreases in brain function, 16 but other studies in younger populations found APOE2-related activity changes in functional MRI data that were comparable to those of the APOE4 allele and thus not compatible with a protective effect. 9, 28 Several unimodal imaging studies reported detrimental effects of the APOE4 allele on cortical glucose metabolism and hippocampal volume, 5 which has been interpreted in light of evidence for amyloidindependent mechanisms of APOE-mediated dementia risk. 29, 30 However, more recent multimodal imaging studies could demonstrate that the predominant effect of APOE4 genotype relates to increased cortical amyloid load, 18, 31 which possibly mediates downstream effects on neurodegeneration and dysfunction. 32 Here, we demonstrate a similar specificity, in the opposite direction, for brain changes associated with the APOE2 allele. Our findings do not exclude the possibility of amyloid-independent APOE2 effects on brain structure and function in younger age or subtle effects on brain characteristics that may not be captured by the imaging markers used in our study. 16, 28, 29, 33, 34 However, within the context of most commonly used biomarkers for characterizing different categories of AD-relevant changes in the aging brain, 35 the predominant pathway of APOE2-mediated effects appears to relate to cortical amyloid processing.\nSupporting evidence for an amyloid-specific effect of APOE2 comes from a recent multicohort study of CSF biomarkers. 7 Thus, across a large sample of 1,233 individuals, APOE2 carrier status was significantly associated with higher CSF Ab 42 levels, but not t-tau or p-tau levels, after controlling for age, sex, and APOE4. Together with the significantly decreased risk of cognitive decline and AD dementia in older persons with low levels of cerebral amyloid load, 36 our data suggest that reduced amyloid pathology may be one of the main neurobiological correlates underlying the clinically protective effect of the APOE2 allele. The decreased risk for cognitive decline in low-amyloid individuals could also be replicated in our study cohort (appendix e-3). However, the full mediation model could not be explicitly tested in our study, given that the clinically protective effect of the APOE2 allele could not be established within the 2-year neuropsychological follow-up available for our study cohort. Previous demonstrations of a clinically protective effect of the APOE2 allele in individuals without dementia included both larger sample sizes and considerably longer follow-up periods. 3, 4 Although CSF tau biomarkers are often used interchangeably with imaging markers of parietal hypometabolism or hippocampal atrophy in the context of neuronal injury/neurodegeneration markers of AD, 35 recent comparisons demonstrate relatively poor agreement between the different types of biomarkers, 37 indicating that they track at least partially independent pathophysiological processes in the aging brain. However, according to our findings, none of these appear to be significantly altered by the presence of an APOE2 allele. Our study has some limitations. Although the analyzed cohort was exceptionally large for a multimodal imaging study involving multitracer PET and MRI data, the sample size for the APOE2 group was limited by the relative rarity of the APOE2 allele. 2, 9 Thus, statistical power may have been too low to reveal a significant age 3 genotype interaction effect on amyloid load, although differences in slope estimates were quite pronounced between genotypic groups. In contrast, effect sizes for APOE2 effects on MRI-and FDG-PET-derived imaging markers indicated negligible effects on these modalities, which were at least 4 times weaker than the effect on amyloid, suggesting that low statistical power is not a likely explanation for these negative findings. Because of the limited number of APOE2 carriers within the whole sample, effects on the different imaging variables were assessed across pooled diagnostic categories (CN and MCI). This approach is commonly used in settings in which sample size is critical such as in most genome-wide association studies 38 and has also been used in several previous candidate gene studies. 39, 40 Controlling the analyses for clinical diagnosis as a confound ensures that the detected genetic effects are not attributable to diagnostic group differences.\n38,40 However, we did not assess additional genotype 3 diagnosis interaction effects in this study. Finally, the cross-sectional nature of our data does not allow estimation of individual brain changes with age, which may be a more sensitive approach for detecting differing brain trajectories in aging APOE2 carriers. 11 Our analysis of genotypespecific age effects on neuroimaging markers should be followed up with longitudinal imaging data.\nUsing a multimodal imaging approach to comprehensively study APOE2 effects in a large sample of older individuals without dementia, our study expands on previous unimodal imaging studies and provides evidence that the APOE2 allele has a relatively selective effect on reduced accumulation of amyloid pathology compared to conventional imaging markers of ADrelevant changes in brain structure and function. These findings add important information to our understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms that may underlie the well-established protective effect of this allele against age-related cognitive decline and AD dementia."}, {"section_title": "AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS", "text": "Michel J.
