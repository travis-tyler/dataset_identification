[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Objectives: The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 3.0T MRI image acquisition scheme changed between the original ADNI-1 grant and the two subsequent grants (ADNI-GO and ADNI-2). The aim of the current study was to investigate the compatibility of the 3.0T ADNI-1 and ADNI-2 T1-weighted volumes using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Methods: T1-weighted images of 30 subjects were acquired using a 3T GE Signa HDx using the ADNI-1 and ADNI-2 T1-weighted volume sequences. Images were pre-processed and analysed using SPM8. Global grey matter (GM), white matter (WM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volumes were compared, as well as voxel-by-voxel differences in GM and WM. Results: Correlation coefficients and percentage differences for each tissue type between ADNI-1 and ADNI-2 were as follows: ((GM: intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.86, ADNI-1 3.09% < ADNI-2) (WM: ICC = 0.91, ADNI-1 2.92% > ADNI-2) (CSF: ICC = 0.90, ADNI-1 1.94% > ADNI-2)). For ADNI-2, widespread increases in GM were found relative to ADNI-1 (cerebellum and pre-central gyrus), with localised decreases along the midline and temporal lobes. For ADNI-1, widespread increases in WM were found relative to ADNI-2 (cerebellum and pre-central gyrus), together with localised decreases in the temporal gyrus. Conclusions: The widespread increase in GM and localised decrease in WM in ADNI-2 compared to ADNI-1 images suggests that the image acquisition protocols are not directly comparable using SPM-8. Total volumes of GM, WM and CSF also differed between the protocols in the following order of magnitude: GM > WM > CSF. This has implications for studies aiming to analyse images acquired using the ADNI-1 and ADNI-2 protocols under VBM. #"}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Beginning in 2004, the first Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) project (ADNI-1) was a 5-year longitudinal multi-centre project designed to combine the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with PET, biological markers and clinical neuropsychological assessments in order to develop techniques that measure the progression of normal aging, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). One of the primary goals of ADNI was to optimise the methods of MRI acquisition in order to ensure the standards of acquiring data were uniform over-time and across sites. As a result, ADNI-1 used a customised 3.0T MP-RAGE pulse sequence that would be compatible between ADNI sites that use differing MRI systems.\nSince the start of the original ADNI grant (ADNI-1), there have been two further phases (ADNI-GO and ADNI-2) of the study designed to extend MRI, biomarker and clinical data to include additional timepoints and introduce a new cohort of early MCI subjects. ADNI-2 started in 2011 and used a modified set of protocols that were designed to support systems that have since been upgraded and to solve problems of variability and improve reliability and efficiency from the original ADNI-1 sequences whilst maintaining the essential requirement of compatibility. As with the ADNI-1 acquisition parameters, the ADNI-2 sequences were also designed to be used by non-ADNI studies.\nVariation in image quality that may arise from differing pulse sequences, scanner manufacturer, scanner upgrades and field strength in large multi-centre studies such as ADNI is important to understand when reproducibility and consistency are essential to its success. Previous studies have evaluated the effect of such parameters and shown that both scanner manufacturer and pulse sequence impact on the reproducibility of volumetric measures (Han et al., 2006; Kempton et al., 2011) . More specifically, Han et al. (2006) found that different pulse sequences had the largest effect on measurement reproducibility in downstream segmentation processing of MR images. Variations of flip angle, TE and TR times have also been shown to be critical in determining image quality with respect to image signal, homogeneity and artefacts (Li and Mirowitz, 2004) , which have been shown to impact on segmentation using cluster based classification techniques (Simmons et al., 1996) . It has been hypothesised that different pulse sequences cause disparity in noise sensitivity that then impacts on brain segmentation causing variation in the inter-subject estimation of grey matter (GM) and white matter (WM) volume (Clark et al., 2006) .\nOne of the most common automated brain segmentation techniques for analysing high-resolution structural MR images is voxel-based morphometry (VBM). VBM is an automated technique that spatially normalises, segments and smoothes MR images before performing voxel-wise statistical tests that examine differences in brain anatomy between groups (Ashburner and Friston, 2000; Whitwell, 2009) . VBM relies on high resolution 3D T1-weighted images that are sensitive enough to assess differences in GM, WM and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). It was therefore a further aim of ADNI to design pulse sequences that provide images that were consistent over-time, across sites and using different scanners whilst being sensitive enough to differentiate subject groups in studies that utilise morphometric analysis.\nThe aim of the current study was to investigate the compatibility of the 3.0T ADNI-1 and ADNI-2 T1-w volumes using VBM. Voxel-wise whole-brain comparisons were made in order to determine the anatomical location of differences in GM, WM and CSF between the two ADNI pulse sequences. Volumetric and reproducibility measures of GM, WM and CSF were also obtained in order to quantify differences in tissue classification and to assess the consistency of each ADNI sequence."}, {"section_title": "Method", "text": "Participants MRI data from 30 young healthy subjects was obtained (Male = 15, mean age 32.2 (SD = 4.9); Female = 15, mean age 25.1 (SD = 3.6)). 3.0T T1-weighted data for the ADNI-1 and ADNI-2 pulse sequences was acquired for each subject in a single scanning session.

Both ADNI-1 and ADNI-2 MRI data were acquired in the sagittal plane using an IR-FSPGR pulse sequence.\nImage pre-processing Data analysis was performed using a unified method of VBM under statistical parametric mapping software version 8 (SPM-8). Initially, T1-weighted images for each subject were manually oriented to place the anterior commissure and posterior commissure in alignment with the Montreal Neurologic Institute (MNI) co-ordinate system. Images were then normalised into standard anatomic space using a linear 12-parameter affine transformation with the SPM-8 default MNI template as reference. An integrated modulation step was applied in conjunction with the normalisation procedure in order to correct for any expansions/contractions in brain size, and to preserve GM and WM volumes in each voxel. Normalised images were then segmented into GM, WM and CSF using a mixed-model cluster analysis technique that uses prior probability maps to classify tissue types within each voxel. Segmented images were then smoothed with an 8mm full width at half maximum isotropic Gaussian kernel in order to reduce differences caused by variations in individual grey and white matter and CSF structure.

The best approach to integrating different neuroimaging datasets, such as ADNI, is an active area of debate and research. The aim of the current study was to investigate the compatibility of the 3.0T ADNI-1 and ADNI-2 T1-weighted volumes using VBM.\nThe main parameters that differed between the ADNI-1 and ADNI-2 pulse sequences were TR time and flip angle. Alterations in these parameters have previously been shown to impact on the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of T1-weighted images. Li and Mirowitz (2004) found that as the TR and flip angle increased so did the SNR and ghosting ratio. Our VBM results show that the ADNI-1 image, with reduced TR time and flip angle, showed significantly widespread reductions in GM compared to the ADNI-2 image. Only localised increases in GM were observed in the ADNI-1 compared to ADNI-2 image, which were restricted to the temporal poles and midline. Voxel-wise comparisons of WM were shown to have an opposite pattern of increased volume in the ADNI-1 compared to ADNI-2 image. Localised reductions in WM were observed in the ADNI-1 images in the temporal lobes and cerebellum. Our VBM findings suggest that the ADNI-1 and ADNI-2 image acquisition protocols are not directly comparable using SPM-8.\nTotal volumes of GM, WM and CSF also differed between the protocols in the following order of magnitude: GM > CSF > WM. Volumetric differences between the imaging sequences were greatest in GM, showing a reduction of 3.04% in the ADNI-1 compared to ADNI-2 sequence. The next largest difference was observed in WM with an increase in volume of 2.92% in the ADNI-1 pulse sequence. CSF volumes were also found to be increased in ADNI-2 images by 1.94%, but statistical levels of significance were not reached. The reliability of each tissue was also assessed in order to determine how closely related volumes were between the ADNI sequences. Although all tissue types were found to be highly related, WM and CSF were more comparable than GM.\nOur findings show that the greatest differences in volume were observed in GM compared to WM. We also show an increased classification of GM and decrease of WM in ADNI-1 compared to ADNI-2 images. Our findings support previous work (Simmons et al., 1996; Li and Mirowitz, 2004; Clark et al., 2006; Han et al., 2006) and demonstrate how variations in pulse sequence impact on the reproducibility of volumetric analysis of GM, It is important to consider the magnitude of sequence-dependent differences in volume to the magnitude of group differences found, for example, when comparing Alzheimer's disease subjects and healthy controls. We observed a sequence-dependent difference of 3.09% in GM and 2.92% in WM in the current study. In previous ADNI studies using SPM, differences between healthy aged matched controls (HC) and AD subjects of 5.6% in GM and 5.7% in WM have been found (Guo et al., 2010) , while Karas et al. (2004) reported differences of 6.2% in GM between AD and MCI subjects. Although the sequence-dependent volume differences are smaller than the group differences, they are large enough to potentially confound subject group difference comparisons. The impact of sequence-dependent differences would be greater when comparisons are made between groups that exhibit more subtle differences in volume, for example MCI converters and non-converters. Although not within the scope of the current study, it would also be of interest to investigate the impact of different scanners from both the same and different manufacturers on VBM and GM/WM volume measurements. In summary, we have used VBM under SPM-8 to investigate the compatibility of the 3.0T ADNI-1 and ADNI-2 T1-weighted volumes. Voxel-wise analysis was used to determine the location of structural differences between the images, and whole-brain volumes were used to assess the magnitude of differences as well as how closely related each sequence was to the other. We have demonstrated how the ADNI-1 and ADNI-2 imaging sequences are not directly comparable using SPM-8. This has implications for studies that aim to use the two different protocols under VBM to assess differences in GM, WM and CSF."}]
