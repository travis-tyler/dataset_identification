However, validating these results with alternative methods in independent patient populations has been difficult. 13, 14 These studies also ignore the clinical heterogeneity in disease progression in AD, wherein some patients show rapid cognitive decline, while others remain relatively stable and/or progress slowly. 15, 16 We applied mass spectrometry-based proteomics to discover plasma proteins associated with disease, using brain atrophy in AD as well as rapid clinical progression, rather than binary distinction between case and control. As a proxy measure of in vivo pathology, we used structural neuroimaging of atrophy in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex (ERC), 2 components of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) that show early pathological changes in AD. 17 For rate of clinical progression, we used both retrospective and prospective measures of cognitive decline. We initially performed 2 independent discovery-phase studies using proteomic analysis of plasma in separate groups of subjects. In the first, we sought proteins that reflect hippocampal atrophy in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and established AD. In the second, we identified proteins differentially expressed in rapidly progressing AD patients relative to those with a less aggressive disease course.

Subsequently, using partial least-squares regression, 29 a method suited to analysis of proteomic data in which colinearity among predictor variables is common, a model with 2 components was fitted to the hippocampal volume data. This was constituted by 8 of the 13 spots which, together, explained 34% of the variance (R2Y, ie, explained variance in the outcome variable) in hippocampal volume.

We used atrophy in the ERC as an alternative measure of disease pathology ( Figure 1 ). The 689 validation-phase subjects included the 95 subjects in the discovery phase albeit with entirely different analytical measures in the 2 studies.\nConfirming the discovery-phase study, we observed a trend toward association between clusterin concentration and ERC atrophy in the combined AD and MCI cohort (n=219; R=\u22120.12, P=.06) after covarying for age and sex. This relationship was driven primarily by a highly significant association between ERC atrophy and clusterin concentration in AD patients (n=113; R=\u22120.30, P=.001). We also correlated plasma clusterin concentration with MMSE score-a measure of cognition available in 576 subjects with MCI and AD-and again found a highly significant negative correlation (r=\u22120.22; P\u03fd.001, age as a covariate).\nWe then compared clusterin levels in rapidly declining AD patients relative to slow decliners using both retrospective and prospective measures of decline relative to the time of blood sampling ( Figure 1 and eTable 2) . Retrospective decline was estimated from the duration of disease and the MMSE score at the point of blood sampling, allowing the annualized fall in MMSE score to be calculated. We used MMSE score, as the ADAS-cog score was not available in all subjects, and defined fast decline as a fall of 2 points or more during a 1-year period relative to the time of blood sampling. Prospective decline was directly measured as the fall in MMSE score 1 year after blood sampling. We observed a significant increase in clusterin concentration in AD patients with accelerated cognitive decline prior to blood sampling (n=344; ANCOVA, t 341 =3.40, P\u03fd.001, duration of disease as covariate) ( Figure 3A) and an increase in clusterin concentration in AD patients with faster cognitive decline subsequent to blood sampling (n=237; independent samples t test, P=.01) ( Figure 3B ).

The primary outcomes in our discovery-phase studies were association with both atrophy of the MTL and the rate of progression of cognitive decline. In the discovery phase, we used hippocampal atrophy derived from manual tracing of the hippocampal formation from magnetic resonance imaging, and in the much larger validation phase, from automated regional analysis of the ERC, an adjacent region of the MTL and the site of earliest pathology in AD.\nHippocampal atrophy is an early event in the pathogenesis of AD, is associated with an increased risk of conversion from MCI to AD, and may even precede the development of cognitive decline. 33, 34 Cerebrospinal fluid levels of phosphorylated tau correlate with hippocampal volume, indicating that this measure reflects an integral feature of AD pathology. 35 Moreover, decreased hippocampal volume in AD patients is associated with neuronal loss, confirming its validity as a marker of neurodegeneration. 35 A second independent outcome variable in the discovery-phase studies was rate of cognitive decline, derived as a measure of decrease in the ADAScog scores during a 6-month interval in AD patients. Using this measure, we dichotomized AD patients as fast and slow decliners, an approach previously shown to predict long-term prognosis in AD. 36 Only clusterin was associated both with hippocampal atrophy in AD and MCI subjects and with fast progressing, or more aggressive, AD. Evidence from human cerebrospinal fluid, postmortem brain, and transgenic animal models suggests a plausible link between clusterin and AD pathology. [37] [38] [39] [40] We therefore sought to confirm the association of clusterin with AD pathology, severity, and progression in a much larger validation-phase study.\nWe confirmed highly significant associations of plasma clusterin concentration with atrophy of the ERC (P=.001), MMSE score (P \u03fd .001), and rate of progression in AD (P\u03fd .001). We also demonstrated a significantly greater risk of subsequent accelerated cognitive decline associated with increased concentration of clusterin in patients with AD and, in normal individuals, with subse-(REPRINTED) ARCH GEN PSYCHIATRY/ VOL 67 (NO. 7), JULY 2010 WWW.ARCHGENPSYCHIATRY.COM 745 quent deposition of fibrillar A\u2424 in the ERC. Our finding of raised plasma clusterin concentration 10 years before fibrillar A\u2424 deposition in the brain in normal elderly individuals suggests that clusterin is raised very early, possibly as an etiopathological event, and is not simply a reaction to other pathology in AD. The observation that clusterin mRNA is significantly increased in blood cells in AD suggests that the observed changes in protein levels reflect changes in expression in disease and not, for example, altered turnover. However, the increase in clusterin mRNA in AD patients does not correlate directly with plasma clusterin concentration, suggesting that the primary sources of plasma clusterin that we find predictive of more aggressive disease are organs other than blood cells such as the liver or possibly even the brain. In the course of this study, 2 groups, including one in which we participated, reported from genome-wide studies that polymorphic variation in CLU, which encodes clusterin, was associated with AD. 31, 32 One possible mechanism for this association would be for the SNPs associated with disease to be modifiers of gene expression. To investigate this, we determined the effect of variations in the clusterin gene on both peripheral mRNA levels and plasma concentration of clusterin protein, including the principal variant associated with disease and 6 other SNPs determined to cover most of the variation in the gene. We did not find significant effects of these SNPs on either peripheral mRNA levels or plasma clusterin concentration, suggesting that our observed association of clusterin protein and mRNA with AD-related pathological processes is independent of genetic variation in the clusterin gene. Our findings raise the possibility of 2 possibly linked mechanisms whereby both altered expression and some other factor in the gene linked to the disease-associated SNPs are active in moderating disease pathology. However, we cannot exclude an effect of genetic variation not examined in this study on clusterin expression or a small effect of CLU variation, below the power of our study to detect, on expression. Nonetheless, the finding of association with both genetic variants and, as we now report, gene and protein expression adds considerable weight to the importance of clusterin to AD pathogenesis. It is interesting that we observe clusterin in 2 closely related but distinct spots in the discovery-phase 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis studies. Proteins are components of multiple spots on 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis because of changes in posttranslational modification, complex formation, and splicing changes resulting in different isoforms. It is possible that some of these variations might be associated with disease processes in addition to the overall amount of protein as measured in the validation-phase study. Finally, we confirmed a previous report of significantly higher plasma concentration of clusterin in TASTPM mice overexpressing APP/PS1 mutations, 41 and we also show that clusterin is closely associated with cortical amyloid plaques, showing an age-dependent concomitant increase with brain amyloid burden.\nPrevious studies suggest that clusterin belongs to a family of extracellular chaperones that regulate amyloid formation and clearance. 42 In vitro experiments show that clusterin regulates amyloid formation in a biphasic manner with low clusterin to substrate ratios enhancing and higher ratios inhibiting amyloid formation, respectively. 43 In mice, in vivo binding of A\u2424 to clusterin enhances its clearance and efflux through the blood-brain barrier. 44 However, previous studies reporting differences in cerebrospinal fluid clusterin concentration between AD patients and controls have been inconclusive. 39, 40 Our findings may have implications for the discovery and characterization of other amyloid chaperone proteins in blood linked to AD pathogenesis. In this context, \u2423 2 -macroglobulin has recently been characterized as an amyloid chaperone that inhibits fibril formation. 45, 46 In a previous proteomic analysis of plasma, we reported the differential expression of \u2423 2 -macroglobulin in AD patients and have also found associations between the plasma concentration of \u2423 2 -macroglobulin and hippocampal metabolite abnormalities in AD. 7, 47 In this previous study, 7 in addition to \u2423 2 -macroglobulin, we also identified components of the complement pathway associated with AD. In the discovery phase of the current study, we note many of the same proteins and also that clusterin may itself play a role in complement activation, suggesting that further examination of this pathway may be useful to identify markers associated with AD. 7 In summary, we have used a novel proteomicneuroimaging discovery paradigm in which the primary end points were well-established measures of pathology in the MTL and rate of disease progression. We identified clusterin as a plasma protein associated with disease pathology, severity, and progression in AD. Although these findings do not support the clinical utility of plasma clusterin concentration as a stand-alone biomarker for AD, they reveal a robust peripheral signature of this amyloid chaperone protein that is responsive to key features of disease pathology. Our findings clearly implicate clusterin, but there may well be other proteins in plasma related to the disease process, and indeed our previous studies and those of others suggest this is the case. These results may have wider implications for the identification of other amyloid chaperone proteins in plasma, both as putative AD biomarkers as well as drug targets of disease-modifying treatments."}]
