[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "11 for the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 13 The lack of strong association between brain beta-amyloid deposition and cognitive impairment has been a challenge for the Alzheimer's disease (AD) field. Although beta-amyloid is necessary for the pathologic diagnosis of AD, it is not sufficient to make the pathologic diagnosis or cause dementia. We sought to identify the genetic modifiers of the relation between cortical beta-amyloid burden (measured using [ 18 F]Florbetapir-PET) and cognitive dysfunction (measured using ADAS-cog) by conducting a genomewide interaction study on baseline data from participants in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) phases GO/2 (n = 678). Near genome-wide significant interaction effect was observed for rs73069071 within the IAPP (amylin) and SLCO1A2 genes (P = 6.2 \u00d7 10 \u2212 8 ). Congruent results were found using data from participants followed up from ADNI-1 (P one-tailed = 0.028, n = 165). Meta-analysis across ADNI-GO/2 and ADNI-1 revealed a genome-wide significant interaction effect (P = 1.1 \u00d7 10 \u2212 8 ). Our results were further supported by similar interaction effects on temporal lobe cortical thickness (whole-brain voxelwise analysis: familywise error corrected P = 0.013) and longitudinal changes in ADAS-cog score and left middle temporal thickness and amygdalar volume (P one-tailed = 0.026, 0.019 and 0.003, respectively). Using postmortem beta-amyloid immunohistochemistry data from 243 AD participants in the Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project, we also observed similar rs73069071-bybeta-amyloid deposition interaction effect on global cognitive function (P one-tailed = 0.005). Our findings provide insight into the complexity of the relationship between beta-amyloid burden and AD-related cognitive impairment. Although functional studies are required to elucidate the role of rs73069071 in AD pathophysiology, our results support the recently growing evidence on the role of amylin in AD."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Beta-amyloid (A\u03b2) formation is a histopathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). 1 Accumulation of A\u03b2 fibrils is an early event in the pathological cascade of AD which occurs before structural brain atrophy and cognitive decline. 1 The 'amyloid hypothesis' that considers A\u03b2 as a causal factor in AD is well supported by rare early-onset autosomal dominant cases of AD. 2 However, the mechanism by which A\u03b2 contributes to late-onset sporadic AD is less clear and likely more complex. 3 Although A\u03b2 deposition is necessary for the pathologic diagnosis of AD, it is not sufficient in and of itself to cause cognitive dysfunction and clinical dementia. Substantial overlap is observed in the amount of A\u03b2 deposition across the continuous spectrum of cognitive impairment. Various studies have identified individuals with high A\u03b2 burden with no or minimal cognitive deficits, 4 whereas others have shown that high A\u03b2 deposition has low specificity for predicting development of AD dementia. 5, 6 In addition, many studies have demonstrated weak to moderate associations between amyloid burden and cognitive dysfunction. 4, [7] [8] [9] [10] Recent advances in the development of positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracers made it possible to quantify brain A\u03b2 deposition non-invasively. 11 A\u03b2-PET can have an important role in determining the mechanisms underlying the susceptibility or resistance to AD and its progression in human cohorts. In this study, using data from participants originally enrolled in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 12 phases GO/2, we conducted a genome-wide interaction analysis to identify the genetic variants that modify the relationship between cortical A\u03b2 deposition and cognitive dysfunction. Next, we attempted to replicate our findings in the data from participants followed up from ADNI-1. We further investigated how the identified genetic variants alter the relationship between baseline A\u03b2 deposition and cortical thickness and also longitudinal changes in cognitive and atrophy measures. Finally, using data from the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROS/MAP) 13, 14 we sought to replicate our findings in this independent postmortem AD neuropathology sample. We hypothesized that identification of genetic variants that modulate the impact of A\u03b2 deposition on cognitive performance could help clarify A\u03b2-related molecular processes associated with cognitive impairment in late-onset AD."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": "Participants were healthy elderly and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD patients from ADNI and ROS/MAP cohorts.

Near genome-wide significant interaction effects were observed for 7 imputed variants located on chromosome 12p12.1 (peak-P = 6.2 \u00d7 10 \u2212 8 ; IMPUTE2 info score40.99) and another imputed variant (rs112821268; IMPUTE2 info score = 0.68) located on chromosome 13q31.1 (P = 7.8 \u00d7 10 \u2212 8 ). As the 7 variants on chromosome 12 were in high linkage disequilibrium (LD: r 2 40.99), we selected one of them with the peak P-value (rs73069071) for further analyses. No other SNP included in the genome-wide study showed Po1 \u00d7 10 \u2212 7 ( Figure 1 ).\nReplication study in participants followed up from ADNI-1 and meta-analysis We performed replication analyses for rs73069071 and rs112821268 using data from 165 participants who were followed up from ADNI-1 (IMPUTE2 info scores = 0.97 and 0.66, respectively). A significant interaction effect was observed for rs73069071 in the same direction observed in the ADNI-GO/2 sample (additive: P one-tailed = 0.028; dominant: P one-tailed = 0.024), while rs112821268 showed no significant interaction effect in the ADNI-1 sample (P one-tailed = 0.44). Hence, all further analyses were carried out only for rs73069071 (major-allele = T; minor-allele = C; minor-allele frequency~12%), which maps to an intronic region within the IAPP (islet amyloid polypeptide or amylin) and the SLCO1A2 (solute carrier organic anion transporter family, member 1A2) genes ( Figure 1 ). Meta-analysis of the results from ADNI-GO/2 and ADNI-1 samples revealed a genome-wide significant (P o 5 \u00d7 10 \u2212 8 ) rs73069071-by-A\u03b2 deposition interaction effect (P = 1.1 \u00d7 10 \u2212 8 )."}, {"section_title": "Post hoc analyses", "text": "In the ADNI-GO/2 sample used in the primary genome-wide analysis, there was no significant difference in demographic and clinical measures between rs73069071 C carriers and rs73069071 TT homozygotes ( Table 1 ). In the absence of the interaction term in the model, no main effect was observed for rs73069071 genotype on performance in ADAS-cog (P = 0.33) or diagnosis (P = 0.27), while accounting for the effects of age, sex, years of education and cortical A\u03b2 deposition. Moreover, there was no main effect of the SNP on cortical A\u03b2 deposition (P = 0.29).\nIncorporating the interaction between rs73069071 genotype and cortical A\u03b2 deposition in the model explained an additional 3.2% of the total variance of performance in ADAS-cog (for comparison purposes: the main effect of APOE genotype in the same model explained 5.2% of the total variance). Excluding the influential observations (n = 39; as determined by Cook's distance 44/number of observations) resulted in further improved interaction effect (P = 2.8 \u00d7 10 \u2212 10 , n = 639). To reveal the nature of the interaction effect, we stratified the groups by genotype. In the ADNI-GO/2 sample, the estimate for the effect size of cortical A\u03b2 deposition on ADAS-cog score controlling for age, sex and education years in rs73069071 TT carriers (\u03b2 = 0.49, s.e. = 0.05, n = 522) was stronger compared with rs73069071 C carriers (\u03b2 = 0.19, s.e. = 0.08, n = 156). Similar results were observed in the ADNI-1 sample (rs73069071 TT : \u03b2 = 0.37, s.e. = 0.07, n = 131; rs73069071 C : \u03b2 = 0.21, s.e. = 0.13, n = 34; after excluding influential observations: P one-tailed = 0.012, n = 155). To help the reader visualize the interaction effect, bivariate correlations between cortical A\u03b2 deposition and ADAS-cog score stratified by rs73069071 genotype for both samples are illustrated in Figure 2 .\nRs73069071-by-cortical A\u03b2 deposition interaction was significantly associated with diagnosis (P = 2.7 \u00d7 10 \u2212 5 ) and memory test scores (RAVLT immediate recall: P = 8.1 \u00d7 10 \u2212 4 , RAVLT learning: P = 0.0023 and RAVLT percent forgetting: P = 0.0017) in the ADNI-GO/2 sample, all consistent in direction with findings on ADAS-cog. Stratifying the participants based on APOE genotype revealed that the interaction effect was independent of APOE \u03b54 In line with our primary finding, exploratory analysis demonstrated a significant rs73069071-by-CSF A\u03b2 1-42 level interaction effect on ADAS-cog score (P = 7.2 \u00d7 10 \u2212 4 ). As expected, the directionality of this effect was opposite to that of the Florbetapir A\u03b2 interaction effect. In addition, we observed a trend-level positive association between rs73069071 C-allele dosage and CSF A\u03b2 1-42 level while controlling for cortical A\u03b2 deposition as well as age, sex and education (P = 0.06, n = 623). However, this effect was not significant in the absence of cortical A\u03b2 deposition in the model (P = 0.49).\nWhole-brain cortical thickness analysis Voxel-based cortical thickness analysis was performed on images from 770 ADNI participants with European ancestry to spatially localize the rs73069071-by-cortical A\u03b2 deposition interaction effect on cortical atrophy. Minor-allele homozygotes were grouped with the heterozygotes to increase the confidence in the results. Consistent with our primary findings on cognitive impairment, we found a significant rs73069071-by-cortical A\u03b2 deposition interaction effect on the cortical thickness of a cluster within the left ventromedial temporal lobe encompassing parahippocampal gyrus, superior and middle temporal gyri, temporal fusiform cortex, temporal pole and amygdala (familywise error corrected P = 0.013, cluster volume = 12 560 mm 3 , max X = \u2212 23, Y = 1, Z = \u2212 36, t = 4.1).

Analyzing 2296 observations from 679 participants, we observed significant three-way rs73069071-by-A\u03b2-by-month of follow-up visit interaction effect on ADAS-cog (P one-tailed = 0.026 [A\u03b2-bymonth of follow-up visit interaction effect in: rs73069071 TT : \u03b2 = 0.11, s.e. = 0.01, P = 4.4 \u00d7 10 \u2212 16 ; in rs73069071 C : \u03b2 = 0.08, s.e. = 0.03, P = 0.02]) consistent with the results from crosssectional analysis.

We did not observe a significant rs73069071-by-A\u03b2 deposition interaction effect (P one-tailed = 0.44) or rs73069071 main effect (P = 0.14) on global cognitive function in the ROS/MAP data in the overall sample (n = 782). However, we found a significant interaction effect among the AD participants (n = 243, P one-tailed = 0.005) consistent in direction with our findings in the ADNI data (Figure 4a ). No significant marginal effect was observed for rs73069071 on global cognitive function in AD patients in the absence of interaction term in the model (P = 0.62). The interaction effect remained significant after co-varying for medication status in AD patients (32% medicated; P = 0.01). However, it was not significant in the MCI patients and healthy individuals. Excluding the influential observations resulted in further improved interaction effects in AD patients (P one-tailed = 7 \u00d7 10 \u2212 4 , n = 232). Exploratory analysis within the AD participants revealed significant rs73069071-by-diffuse-A\u03b2 deposition interaction effect on cognitive performance (P one-tailed = 0.04; after excluding influential observations: P one-tailed = 5 \u00d7 10 \u2212 5 , n = 232). However, no interaction effect was evident between rs73069071 genotype and neuritic-A\u03b2 plaques (P one-tailed = 0.2; after excluding influential observations: P one-tailed = 0.07, n = 231; Figure 4b ).

The estimated effect size of diffuse A\u03b2 deposition on neuritic A\u03b2 burden controlling for the effects of age, sex and education was stronger in rs73069071 TT participants (\u03b2 = 0.44, s.e. = 0.07, n = 173) in comparison to rs73069071 C carriers (\u03b2 = 0.21, s.e. = 0.09, n = 70; Figure 4c ). As ROS/MAP participants were significantly older (mean age = 87.7 years) than ADNI-GO/2 participants (mean age = 72.5 years), we also performed sub-analyses including only younger healthy, MCI and AD ROS/MAP participants and observed significant rs73069071-by-A\u03b2 deposition interaction effects in participants aged 85 and younger (n = 256, P one-tailed = 0.03) (Supplementary Table 1 )."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "We identified a genetic variant within the IAPP/SLCO1A2 genes (rs73069071) that modified the effect of cortical A\u03b2 deposition (as measured by [ 18 F]Florbetapir-PET) on AD-related cognitive impairment and temporal lobe atrophy in the ADNI-GO/2 and (a) brain A\u03b2 deposition (quantitative composite score computed by averaging the percent areas occupied by A\u03b2 across eight brain regions, as measured by immunohistochemistry; Correlations among regional percent areas occupied by A\u03b2 across these brain regions are illustrated in Supplementary Figure 1 ) and global cognitive function; (b) diffuse (top) and neuritic (bottom) brain A\u03b2 deposition (quantitative composite scores computed by averaging standardized regional densities across 5 brain regions) and global cognitive function; and (c) diffuse and neuritic brain A\u03b2 deposition.

Rs73069071 CC and rs73069071 TC carriers are grouped together for the purpose of visualization.\nADNI-1 samples both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. With greater rs73069071 minor-allele (C-allele) dosage, participants showed weaker associations between brain A\u03b2 deposition and cognitive impairment and temporal lobe atrophy. ROS/MAP postmortem data provided further evidence for the effect of rs73069071 genotype on the relationship between brain A\u03b2 deposition (as measured by immunohistochemistry) and cognitive dysfunction among AD patients. Exploratory analyses suggested that the observed SNP-by-A\u03b2 deposition interaction effect was specific to diffuse-A\u03b2 deposition, rather than neuritic-A\u03b2 plaques. Moreover, AD participants with greater rs73069071 C-allele dosage demonstrated weaker association between diffuse and neuritic A\u03b2 deposition.\nMeta-analysis of cross-sectional results in ADNI-1 and ADNI-GO/ 2 revealed a genome-wide significant IAPP/SLCO1A2 variant-byin vivo measured cortical A\u03b2 deposition interaction effect on cognitive impairment (ADAS-cog). The interaction effect was evident in all diagnostic subgroups in ADNI-GO/2, except for the healthy participants (that is, AD, late MCI and early MCI; with the largest effect in AD). However, in the ROS/MAP postmortem sample, the rs73069071-by-A\u03b2 deposition interaction effect was present only in AD patients, and was not evident in the whole sample and in the MCI subgroup. This discrepancy between in vivo and postmortem studies may be explained by the differences in the A\u03b2 burden measurements (in vivo PET imaging vs postmortem immunohistochemistry) and/or the correlation between A\u03b2 and cognitive measures (ROS/MAP: r = 0.29; ADNI-GO/2: r = 0.43). In addition, as also mentioned above, participants in the ROS/MAP sample were significantly older than the participants in the ADNI-GO/2 study. Therefore, the healthy and MCI participants in the ROS/MAP study may represent cognitively healthier subpopulations and might have been more resistant to the effects of A\u03b2 deposition than their counterparts in the ADNI-GO/2 sample. There is also evidence demonstrating that the association between AD pathology and severity of dementia is attenuated in the oldest old, which is suggestive of other underlying neuropathological processes for cognitive dysfunction in this population. 29, 30 The fact that we were able to replicate our results in less old ROS/MAP participants further supports this assumption.\nUsing whole-brain voxel-based cortical thickness analysis, we found a significant IAPP/SLCO1A2 variant-by-cortical A\u03b2 deposition interaction effect on atrophy in AD-susceptible temporal lobe regions (consistent with the primary effect on cognitive impairment). This suggests that IAPP/SLCO1A2 variant may be modifying the impact of A\u03b2 deposition on AD-related neurodegeneration. Critically, we also observed consistent effects longitudinally on both cognitive impairment and atrophy rate in temporal lobe structures. Taken together, these suggest that IAPP/SLCO1A2 variants may have prognostic value predicting brain atrophy and cognitive decline based on cortical A\u03b2 deposition.\nOur exploratory analysis in AD participants suggested that the rs73069071 genotype-by-A\u03b2 deposition interaction effect on cognitive dysfunction was primarily driven by the interaction between rs73069071 genotype and diffuse plaque burden. Additionally, we observed stronger association between diffuse and neuritic plaques in rs73069071 TT carriers in comparison to rs73069071 C carriers. Neuritic and diffuse plaque burden are correlated with one another and both are associated with cognitive impairment and dementia symptoms. 31, 32 However, neuritic A\u03b2 deposition is considered to be more closely associated with AD-related neuronal injury, 33 while diffuse plaques tend to be less pathogenic 34 and occur more frequently in people without dementia. 35 Altogether, these data suggest that the rs73069071 C-allele decreases the association between diffuse and neuritic plaque burden, which in turn leads to decreased association between diffuse plaque burden and cognitive impairment. We also observed a trend towards higher CSF A\u03b2 1-42 levels with rs73069071 C-allele dosage in the ADNI-GO/2 data. Therefore, it is also possible that the rs73069071 C-allele mitigates the impairment in A\u03b2 clearance from the brain, which has been shown to be a major culprit in late-onset AD. 36 Rs73069071 maps to an intronic region within the IAPP and SLCO1A2 genes on chromosome 12p12.1. No genome-wide significant expression quantitative trait locus or functional variant has been identified in high linkage disequilibrium at this locus (R 2 40.4; as per HaploReg v4.1 ([http://compbio.mit.edu/Hap loReg)) and therefore definitive molecular consequences of this variant remain to be determined. SLCO1A2 encodes a sodiumindependent transporter, which is best known for the cellular uptake of organic anions such as bile acids in the liver. Although SLCO1A2 is highly expressed in the brain, 37 we found no evidence supporting its role in AD, or the effect of rs73069071 on SLCO1A2 gene expression levels in different brain regions (n = 134). 37, 38 However, an IAPP gene product, amylin, has recently been implicated in AD pathophysiology.\nThe IAPP gene encodes a pancreatic peptide hormone named amylin which is most known for its role in glycemic control. Recent literature has demonstrated that plasma amylin levels are lower in AD and MCI individuals in comparison to healthy controls 39, 40 and show positive association with cognitive performance. 41 Although it is possible that amylin affects AD-related cognitive impairment through its role in the peripheral metabolic network, recent studies have suggested more direct central effects for amylin. 42 Amylin crosses the blood-brain barrier and a recent study has reported amylin deposition in the form of amyloid and also occasional co-depositions of amylin and A\u03b2 in AD brain tissue. 43 Although further validation is required, Jackson et al. have proposed that amylin could be considered as the 'second amyloid' in AD. 43 Amylin oligomerization and deposition in the pancreas of type-2 diabetes patients, which is the result of its chronic hypersecretion, induces apoptotic pancreatic \u03b2-cell death. 44 Intriguingly, direct neurotoxicity of amyloidogenic forms of amylin (such as the human amylin) have also been documented in embryonic rat hippocampal cultures, 45 and in vivo in rats overexpressing human amylin. 46 In addition to the direct pathophysiological role of amylin in the brain (neurotoxicity in the form of oligomers and amyloid fibrils), it seems that it is also indirectly involved via interactions with A\u03b2. 40, 47 It is shown that actions of both amylin and A\u03b2 in the brain depend on the amylin receptors 48 and that amylin receptor antagonists block both amylin-and A\u03b2-induced toxicity. 49 Moreover, amylin and A\u03b2 are both degraded by the same protease (insulin degrading enzyme). 50 In line with these, some recent studies have provided evidence on the beneficial effects of chronic injection of amylin 51 and its non-amyloidogenic analog (pramlintide) 39, 51 in mice models of AD. Amylin/pramlintidetreated mice demonstrated superior learning and memory performance, 39, 51 lower A\u03b2 deposition in the brain, 51 increased A\u03b2 in CSF, 51 and decreased synapse loss and oxidative stress markers in the hippocampus. 39 When taken together, it seems that amylin plays a complex role in the brain and it is possible that while its amyloid form may contribute to AD progression, its nonamyloid form may provide a protective effect.\nOur findings must be interpreted in light of the limitations of this study. Despite using the data from relatively large databases with the amyloid burden data, given the frequency of the rs73069071 minor allele (~12%), our sample sizes were relatively small in terms of genetic studies and our findings should be replicated in future studies with larger samples. However, the convergence of the evidence from different modalities and the replication in different samples strengthens the confidence in our findings. The molecular mechanism(s) through which rs73069071 could affect AD pathophysiology is yet to be studied. It is also possible that the effect of rs73069071 on AD is through its effect on genes other than IAPP and SLCO1A2. Assuming that the effect of rs73069071 is on amylin production, assessing the effect of rs73069071 on circulating amylin levels and also simultaneous quantification of A\u03b2 and amylin depositions in characterized AD neuropathology samples such as ROS/MAP or in vivo in humans using PET imaging can shed light on the inter-relationships between A\u03b2 and amylin in determining the risk and progression of AD. As A\u03b2-PET radiotracers are designed to bind to the \u03b2-sheet structure of amyloid depositions, they can also bind to other amyloid aggregates. 52 However, the interaction that we observed between the amylin gene polymorphism and A\u03b2 burden in the ADNI sample is unlikely to be driven by a bias of measuring both A\u03b2 and amylin amyloids using [ 18 F]Florbetapir, as [ 18 F]Florbetapir displays high binding affinity (K i = 6.7 nM) for A\u03b2, but low affinity (K i = 501 nM) for amylin aggregates. 52 Furthermore, the interaction effect was also present in the ROS/MAP neuropathology sample where the A\u03b2 burden is quantified by an unbiased immunohistochemistry staining technique. On the other hand, derivatives of A\u03b2 imaging compounds such as [ 125 I]IPBF that show high binding affinity for amylin aggregates 52 could potentially be used to measure amylin deposition quantitatively in the brain and contribute to our understanding of late-onset AD pathophysiology.\nOverall, our findings provide insight into the complexity of the relationship between A\u03b2 burden and AD-related cognitive impairment.\nAlthough not yet functionally validated, our findings support the growing literature on the role of amylin in AD pathophysiology. In addition, pramlintide, which is approved for treatment of diabetes, has been proposed in the treatment of AD. 40 Hence, our results could also inform potential clinical trials of pramlintide or similar drugs for AD."}]
