[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "A newly emerged betacoronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), causes a worldwide pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) , presenting a devastating threat to human public health attributed to its high infectivity and fatality (1) (2) (3) (4) . As of 18 July 2020, COVID-19 has resulted in 14 RNA viruses usually have high mutation rates and tend to evolve rapidly (5) . For a new RNA virus affecting humans, such as SARS-CoV-2, a recent host shift likely decreases its fitness and impels the virus to adapt to the new host environments and public health interventions (6, 7) . Natural selection may act on the transmissibility and virulence of SARS-CoV-2 through adaptive dynamics of specific genomic mutations, which has been observed in Ebola, Zika and other viruses (6, 7) . SARS-CoV-2 has circulated globally since its first outbreak in late December, 2019, and accumulated plenty of genetic polymorphisms within the short period. There are currently more than 90,000 complete SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences publicly available, of which 16,183 nucleotide substitutions have been identified (data retrieved from https://bigd.big.ac.cn/ncov/), compiling the largest population genomic data of nonhumans so far. These SARS-CoV-2 lineages have exhibited considerable variation of transmission and clinical characteristics in different countries or regions. For example, the basic reproduction number (R0) ranges between 2.2 and 5.9 (8, 9) , and the mortality rate from 0.8% to 14.5% (10) .\nIt is critical for epidemic trend prediciton and disease control to understand whether natural selection is actively driving the adaptive evolution of transmissibility and virulence of SARS-CoV-2 during the pandemic. If it is under selection, further research is warranted to identify the functional mutants contributing to the evolving epidemiological and pathogenic characteristics. Multiple studies have been carried out to explore the problem. Tang et al (2020) noticed that at the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak, two major virus lineages (the S and L lineages) showed dramatic allele frequency difference before and after the lockdown of .

However the argument is not conclusive for that allele frequency change is more likely caused by other confounding factors, e.g., stochastic fluctuation, founder effect or sampling bias (7, 12) . Another study found the D614G replacement on one receptor binding domain of the Spike protein is predominant in multiple regions or countries and associated with higher upper respiratory tract viral loads, indicating a possible fitness advantage (10) .\nNevertheless, all these studies are based on allele frequency increase or differentiation that is not necessarily due to natural selection. It is only useful for screening for the putative mutant loci instead of serving as a persuasive proof of the hypothesis. Despite the individual functional mutants identified in aforementioned studies, \"there is a lack of compelling evidence\" of mutations that \"impact the progression, severity or transmission of COVID-19 in an adaptive manner\" (7) . Indeed, the evolutionary driving forces underlying the epidemiological dynamics and pathogenic changes of SARS-CoV-2 remain elusive and uncertain. Furthermore, a genomewide survey of functional mutations and their implication of the epidemiological perspective were not fully accomplished either.\nHerein, we analyze SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences currently collected from different geographies and time points of the outbreaks. We utilize patterns of genomic polymorphism based on the ratio of nonsynonymous mutations (N) vs synonymous mutations (S) in different groups, which are exclusively caused by natural selection and robust to clustering infections, founder effects and sampling bias commonly existing in viral genomic data. The analysis validates the hypothesis that ongoing natural selection is actively acting on the SARS-CoV-2 genomes, shaping the epidemic dynamics of COVID-19. We then partition the viral lineages of world samples into clusters according to their genomic similarity as a result of global transmission and clustering outbreaks. A spatial and temporal landscape of mutants is constructed based on the clusters, and critical mutants potentially conferring pathogenic and clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 are highlighted. Our results provide a reference of genomic mutations for epidemic prediction, surveillance and clinical treatments of COVID-19. CoV-2 genome sequences publicly available from 84 countries as of June   2 , 2020, across Asia, Europe, America, Africa, and Oceania were downloaded and aligned using MUSCLE (13) . The 5'-and 3'untranslated regions (UTRs) and regions with a high missing rate were trimmed out, with a final length of 29,410 nucleotides remained. A total number of 8,999 mutations were identified."}, {"section_title": "22,078 SARS-", "text": "Since the virus populations are undergoing multiple clustering infections and founder effects, it is hard to use allele frequencies to draw reliable conclusions on virus evolution (12) .\nOn the premise of neutral evolution, the relative numbers (ratio) of non-synonymous mutants (N) vs synonymous mutants (S) should be a constant unaffected by changes of population sizes, sine both S and N sites should demonstrate identical population behavior under the common demographic history and neutrality. Accordingly in the following sections, our analysis is mainly based on the analysis of N and S numbers for different sets of mutations."}, {"section_title": "Purifying selection dominates the viral genomic evolution", "text": "We first calculate the ratio of N/S using only mutation sites in very low frequencies. 4,573 non-synonymous mutations and 2,202 synonymous mutations with the minor frequencies (f) <0.01% are identified. The N/S ratio is calculated to be 2.0768. From population genetics theory we know that when in very low frequencies, the population behavior of deleterious or beneficial mutants is essentially the same as that of selectively neutral mutants (14) . Therefore, the N/S ratio 2.0768 represents the relative abundance of N and S mutations when the genome evolves under neutrality, and is determined only by sequence composition and nucleotide substitution rates of viral genomes. In the following analysis, we use the N/S ratio of mutations with f <0.01% as the reference under neutral conditions. We then check the relative occurrences of N and S mutations with higher frequencies. As we can see in Table 1 , the ratio of N/S for mutations with the frequency f>0.001 decreases to1.52 and is significantly lower than N/S for f<0.01% (P =0.0034, Chi-squared test), indicating .

The pattern of reduced N/S ratio is consistently observed, and the N/S ratio value keeps decreasing with the increase of f. The N/S ratio is 1.557 for SNPs with 0.0001 < f <= 0.001, is 1.50 for 0.001 <f <= 0.01, and 1.46 for 0.01 <f <= 0.05 (see Table 1 ). It is consistent with the fact that mutations with higher allele frequencies are normally older than those with lower allele frequencies and could be under natural selection for a longer duration showing more prominent effect.\nWe further compare numbers of synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations for widespread (defined as mutants observed in samples of more than 5 countries) and nonwidespread (defined as mutants observed only in 1 country) variations. The widespread mutations tend to exist in the populations for a longer time than non-widespread ones. The N/S ratio of mutants predisposed to spread more countries is significantly lower (P = 0.0009, Chisquared test; Table 1 ), suggesting that purifying selection acting on widespread mutations which exist for longer time and resulting a lower N/S ratio. We also group mutations according to the spanning of their sample-collection times, which is calculated as the durations between the earliest and most recent sample-collection times of viral genomes carrying that mutations.\nThe N/S ratio of short-spanning-time mutations (<2 days) is 1.842 (3001/1629), while the N/S ratio of long-spanning-time mutations (>60 days) is 1.498 (409/273). The lower N/S ratio indicates more selective constrains on these long-spanning-time mutations, again, confirming the effect of purifying selection (P = 0.0137, Chi-squared test; Table 1 ).\nIn summary, the aforementioned three analyses reveal that despite of spreading for more than eight months and the accumulation of sufficient mutations, the SAR-CoV-2 genomes are overall under purifying selection and relatively conserved. The conclusion also accords with the low genome-wide mutation rate inferred recently (0.000869 per site per year (12)).\nPositive selection drives the adaptive evolution of genes conferring pathogenicity and infectivity .

Table 2 ), presenting evidence of positive selection. Another gene encoding the nucleocapsid (N) protein also shows an elevated N/S ratio (2.422) with the P-value close to 0.05 (P = 0.065). Interestingly, except for the ORF10 gene that has been under very limited studies, the rest three positively-selected genes encode viral accessory proteins that play critical roles in virus-host interactions and host immune response modulation, contributing to different pathogenic outcomes (15, 16) . ORF3a has been demonstrated to induce cellular apoptosis that is recognized to antagonize host antiviral immune defense system and facilitate viral pathogenicity (16) ; ORF8 was reported to disrupt antigen presentation and mediate immune evasion that warrants further investigation (17, 18); N protein, directly binding to viral RNA, is essential for viral encapsidation, and was also reported participating in immune-evasion mechanism and promoting viral infections (19) (20) (21) (22) . These findings highlight that during COVID-19 global pandemic, positive selection is very likely an essential driving force and is acting on the interplay between coronavirus infection and host immune system defense.\nIn contrast, the majority of the viral genes demonstrates a N/S ratio < 2.0 ( Fig. 1 , Table 2 ), being consistent with last section that purifying selection is dominant. Nine genes show statistically significantly reduced proportion of nonsynonymous substitutions (P < 0.05; Table   2 ). Eight of the negatively selected genes (NSP12, NSP4, NSP13, NSP3, NSP1, NSP10, NSP7\nand NSP5) encode non-structure proteins of SARS-CoV-2, including the main protease, papainlike protease, RNA helicase, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and so on, which are essential is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint\nThe copyright holder for this this version posted September 9, 2020. . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.07.20189860 doi: medRxiv preprint in viral RNA replication, transcription, and translation (23) . In addition, the most significant gene under negative selection encodes the SARS-CoV-2 membrane (M) protein that plays a central role in viral assembly and viral particle formation (23) . The results indicate that proteins conferring fundamental molecular functions, such as viral replication, translation etc., are under significant purifying selection."}, {"section_title": "Clustering pattern of viral lineages", "text": "As we have demonstrated, although the viral genomes are under purifying selection, positive selection has been driving the evolution of genes related to coronavirus infection and is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint\nThe copyright holder for this this version posted September 9, 2020.

C01, the cluster preponderates in East and Southeast Asia is likely the earliest cluster if using sample-collection dates as a criterion (also with the inferred TMRCA, results not shown).\nA nonsynonymous mutation L84S in the ORF8 protein, together with a tightly linked synonymous variant (S76S) in the NSP4 protein, emerged on the branch leading to the other primary cluster C07 in Asia ( Fig. 2A) .

The proportion of L lineage in samples collected before and after Wuhan lockdown showed distinct differentiation (99% vs 70%), and it was hypothesized that the frequency change of L lineage may due to different pressures of negative selection from containment measures (11) . It is disputable for that the allele frequency change can be caused by sampling bias and clustering infection as well (12) . In the map of haplotype network, L84S is pinpointed to the branch connecting C01 and C07 (Fig. 2) , with a very low frequency of 0.1294% in C01 and increased to 100% in C07, demonstrating an obvious cluster expanding pattern in the fine scale. Furthermore, we identified the signature of positive selection acting on ORF8 as mentioned previously. Based on the two facts, this mutation is possibly a candidate site under positive selection for further evaluation. According to COVID-3D database, the L84S amino acid alteration was predicted to eliminate 4 hydrophobic bonds and lead to destabilization of ORF8 protein. Another study with computational protein modeling proposed that L84S can mitigate the binding of ORF8 to human complement C3b, which is negatively regulated by the C-terminus serine-protease catalytic domain of the human complement factor 1 (F1), and activates the host complement system (24) . Therefore, the L84S mutation possibly impacts the normal function of ORF8, and plays an important role in the host immune responses and infection outcome.\nA recurrent nonsynonymous mutation D614G in the epitope region (the receptor-binding domain) of Spike glycoprotein protein (S) occurred in the common ancestor of the C11-C14 clusters ( Fig. 2A) . C11-C14 clusters were widely preponderated across Europe, America, Asia, and Africa. Spike glycoprotein is essential for the host cell infection of SARS-CoV-2. D614G was reported to be relevant to a high viral load in COVID-19 patients and higher infectious titers of spike-pseudotyped viruses, indicating a possible fitness advantage (10) . Another nonsynonymous mutation P323L in NSP12 (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, RdRP) also occurred in the common ancestor of C11-C14, coupling the evolution with D614G. This mutation might regulate the activity of RdRp, and is related to viral replication and fidelity (25) . is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint\nThe copyright holder for this this version posted September 9, 2020. Russia. According to structural prediction provided by the COVID-3D database, R203K and G204R both destabilize the N protein, and the predicted actual free energy value (\u0394\u0394G) using the mutation Cutoff Scanning Matrix (\u0394\u0394G stability mCSM, henceforth) are -1.71 and -1.07 kcal.mol -1 respectively, resulting the alteration of their molecular interactions with other amino acids, such as carbonyl, polar bonds, and hydrogen bonds (Fig. 3A-D) . Mutations on N protein that was under positive selection may be functional relevant to viral replication, assembly and participating in immune-evasion and viral infections (19) (20) (21) (22) . We further infer the mortality rates of viruses belonging to the two clusters (see Methods). The mortality rates of C11 and C12 are dramatically different (16.03% and 3.98%), and may be explained by the functional alternation of N protein caused by the two nonsynonymous mutations.\nDiverged from C11, the Q57H mutation in ORF3a, another positively selected gene, arose and fixed in the C13 cluster that dominates in Saudi Arabia and broadly distributed in Europe (Fig.2) . This variant was predicted to exert structural destabilization (\u0394\u0394G stability mCSM = -1.55 kcal.mol -1 ) (Fig. 3E -F) and deleterious effects on protein function (Issa et al., 2020). Another mutation T85I in NSP2 further diverges C14 from C13 that preponderates (>50%) in USA and European countries and with a lower mortality rate (2.83%). This mutation also fall within the region of NSP2 homologous to the protein (PDB 3ld1), and may be functional in viral pathogenicity (28) .\nA full list of the 37 mutations and their functional significance can be found in Table 3 ."}, {"section_title": "Mutations with rapid increase of frequency within clusters as potential targets", "text": "Other than the mutations demonstrating nearly-fixed divergence among clusters, mutations presenting prominent frequency increasing trend over sampling times within a cluster are potential sites with evolutionary or functional significance in COVID-19 epidemic.

Comparing the relative excess of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions is robust to population size changes, representing an efficient approach for evaluating the effects of natural selection on SARS-CoV-2. The approach we used in this study is similar to the known McDonald-Kreitman test (MK test) in molecular evolution, which compares the ratios of non-synonymous site number over synonymous site number of between between-species divergence to that of within-species polymorphisms, and uses the latter as an internal control under neutrality. However, the method we proposed here is for only comparing genetic polymorphisms within a species. The method is novel in using the N/S ratio of rare mutants with very low frequencies as the internal control under neutral evolution, which is valid according to population genetic theory (14) .
